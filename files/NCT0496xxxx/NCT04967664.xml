&#xD;
          2. Female or male subjects aged 18 years or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. For women of childbearing potential: negative pregnancy tests at Screening Visit&#xD;
             (Visit 1), the Randomization Visit (Visit 2), and prior to each reapplication of the&#xD;
             investigational medicinal product (IMP), and must have agreed to practice medically&#xD;
             acceptable methods of birth control.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Confirmation of diagnosis of chronic moderate to severe PSNP&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Documented diagnosis of PSNP by the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. A history of post-surgical pain with a duration of at least 6 months to maximally&#xD;
                  36 months that is plausibly related to the surgical intervention as documented on&#xD;
                  a body map.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Douleur Neuropathique 4 interview (DN4i) of at least 3 out of 7 points at Visit&#xD;
                  1.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. The pain must extend beyond the scar area to neuroanatomically adjacent skin&#xD;
                  areas and be related to the site of the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Documented diagnosis of probable or definite PSNP according to the following criteria&#xD;
             (Finnerup et al. 2016):&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. The pain must be associated with sensory signs in the same neuroanatomically&#xD;
                  plausible distribution. The area of sensory changes may extend beyond, be within,&#xD;
                  or overlap with the area of pain (criterion for probable neuropathic pain), or&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. In addition to 5a : Direct surgical evidence (e.g., surgeon´s clear verification&#xD;
                  of an intraoperative nerve lesion) (criterion for definite neuropathic pain).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The subject has moderate to severe pain with a baseline value for 24-hr average pain&#xD;
             intensity of at least 4 points on the NPRS. The baseline value is calculated as the&#xD;
             average of the 24-hr average pain intensity ratings of the Baseline Phase (Day -7 to&#xD;
             Day -1). At least 5 (out of 7) pain ratings should be available during the Baseline&#xD;
             Phase. If less than 5 pain ratings are available, the subject may be rescheduled for&#xD;
             Visit 2 (1 time only) after having received appropriate re-training in the use of the&#xD;
             e-diary to ensure compliance.&#xD;

             standard Qutenza topical systems (1120 cm2).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. The skin in the area where the IMP will be applied, and that may also contain the scar&#xD;
             tissue, is intact, dry, and non-irritated (i.e., there are no signs and symptoms of&#xD;
             skin disease, skin irritation, inflammation or injury, such as active herpes zoster&#xD;
             lesions, atopic dermatitis, ulceration, wounds).&#xD;

&#xD;
               2. receives a stable systemic treatment for PSNP that started more than 30 days&#xD;
                  prior to the Randomization Visit (Visit 2).&#xD;
