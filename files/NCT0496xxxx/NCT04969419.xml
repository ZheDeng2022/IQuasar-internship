      This study examines melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer in people diagnosed with vitiligo&#xD;
      compared to matched controls.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For the primary analysis, this study examines the risk of melanoma and nonmelanoma skin&#xD;
      cancers: squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma in people diagnosed with vitiligo.&#xD;
      It also examines actinic keratoses. In secondary analysis, this study examines the prevalence&#xD;
      of skin cancer in people diagnosed with vitiligo compared to matched controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study also examines whether the susceptibility to melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer&#xD;
      may vary between different patient subgroups, e.g. ethnicity, those who undergo phototherapy&#xD;
      or treatment with the new targeted biologic immunosuppressive therapies.&#xD;

        This study will use routinely collected and collated data from Optimum Patient Care&#xD;
        Research Database (OPCRD) to provide a broadly representative sample of the population of&#xD;
        the UK.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All eligible adult patients (aged â‰¥ 18) registered with General Practioner (GP)&#xD;
             practices contributing data to OPCRD between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2020,&#xD;
             were eligible for inclusion in the study. People diagnosed with vitiligo prior to the&#xD;
             study period (prevalent vitiligo) and people newly diagnosed with vitiligo during the&#xD;
             study period (incident vitiligo) are included as cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  People actively registered with the GP practice at that date without a history of&#xD;
             vitiligo require a minimum one-year registration with their GP practice.&#xD;
