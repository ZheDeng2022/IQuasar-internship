  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The majority of studies conducted on uremic toxins involve patients before end stage renal&#xD;
      failure or dialysis patients. Only a few studies have focused on transplant patients. In&#xD;
      addition, the relationship between serum concentrations of uremic toxins and&#xD;
      immunosuppressive drug concentrations has never been studied to date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator research hypothesis is that, due to the strong plasma protein binding of&#xD;
      calcineurin inhibitors, an interaction with protein-bound uremic toxins could alter drug&#xD;
      concentrations that explain difficulties in reaching therapeutic targets.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In France, the national prevalence of end-stage kidney disease (including dialysis and renal&#xD;
      transplantation) is 1,232 per million inhabitants. As in all transplants, renal&#xD;
      transplantation needs immunosuppressive therapy. This treatment may be difficult to adjust in&#xD;
      some patients. However, achieving the therapeutic target is essential to have an efficiency&#xD;
      synonymous with graft survival and better tolerance to the drug. The immunosuppressive class&#xD;
      drug of interest in the present project is the class of calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus&#xD;
      and ciclosporin) that are widely used in both initial and maintenance immunosuppression.&#xD;
      These drugs have the pharmacological specificities to be highly bound to plasma proteins and&#xD;
      requiring pharmacological therapeutic monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the progression of chronic kidney disease, many molecules accumulate as a result of&#xD;
      decreased kidney excretion capacity, such as compounds called uremic toxins. The&#xD;
      investigators research is part of the European network for the study of these toxins (Eutox&#xD;
      group) and has largely contributed to the better knowledge of these toxins. In particular,&#xD;
      they are defined by their dose-dependent deleterious effects. These molecules are classified,&#xD;
      according to their molecular weight, into small molecules, medium molecules and molecules&#xD;
      strongly bound to plasma proteins (p-cresyl sulphate [pCS], indoxyl sulphate [IS] and indol&#xD;
      acetic acid [IAA]). This last group of protein will be evaluated in this project.&#xD;
