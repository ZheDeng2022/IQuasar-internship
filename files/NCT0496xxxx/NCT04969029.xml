  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-group, parallel, randomized, standard-control phase II study comparing the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of immunotherapy versus standard chemotherapy in patients undergoing&#xD;
      T4NX/TXN+ colon cancer surgery with MSI-H or POLE/ POLD1 mutations.This study was conducted&#xD;
      in the Department of Gastroenterology, Tumor Hospital of Tianjin Medical University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with MSI-H or POLE/ POLD1 gene mutations confirmed by PCR sequencing or NGS&#xD;
      sequencing will be randomly assigned (2:1) to immunotherapy (experimental group) or standard&#xD;
      chemotherapy (control group) after signing informed consent. In this study, 30 patients will&#xD;
      be enrolled, 20 patients will receive immunotherapy and 10 patients will receive standard&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the immunotherapy group, the treatment regimen was Tirelizumab 200mg, intravenously&#xD;
      infused once every 3 weeks until the end of 12 months of treatment, with a total of 17&#xD;
      infused times. Patients enrolled in this group could enjoy the preferential policy of&#xD;
      purchasing 7 times and giving 10 times at their own expense.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The chemotherapy regimen of the standard chemotherapy group was XELOX regimen, oxaliplatin&#xD;
      130mg/m2, d1, capecitabine 1000mg/m2, orally, bid (half an hour after breakfast and dinner),&#xD;
      d1-14, every 21 days. The duration of treatment was determined according to the patient's&#xD;
      postoperative pathological stage (3 months for T4N0/ T1-3N1 and 6 months for T4N+/ T1-3N2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients received regular and periodic reviews, with imaging evaluations every 3 months for&#xD;
      the first 2 years and every 6 months after 2 years. Safety will be evaluated by AE and&#xD;
      laboratory tests. After tumor recurrence or metastasis was first detected, tumor tissue&#xD;
      biopsies were taken again for NGS sequencing, and all patients were followed up every 3&#xD;
      months until death according to the plan.&#xD;
