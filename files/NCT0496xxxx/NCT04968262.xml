  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In our study, 17 septic, 43 sepsis-related acute kidney injury and 24 control patients were&#xD;
      enrolled. Blood and urine samples were collected at the intensive care unit from acutely&#xD;
      diagnosed septic and sepsis-related acute kidney injury patients at three time points (T1-3):&#xD;
      T1: within 24 hours after admission; T2: second day morning; T3: third day morning of&#xD;
      follow-up. Patients with malignancies needing palliative care, end-stage renal disease or&#xD;
      kidney transplantation were excluded. Not more than one sample (venous blood, midstream spot&#xD;
      urine) was collected from control patients. Serum and urinary actin levels were determined by&#xD;
      quantitative Western blot. Urinary actin concentrations were expressed as µg/L, while serum&#xD;
      actin levels were expressed as mg/L. Data were compared with laboratory and clinical&#xD;
      parameters. Patients were categorized by the Sepsis-3 definitions and 30-day mortality data&#xD;
      were investigated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Actin is a globular protein present in every cell with a 42 kilodalton molecular mass. It&#xD;
      plays an important role in muscle contraction while being an essential component of the&#xD;
      cytoskeleton as well. Several proteins (e.g. gelsolin, Gc-globulin) bind actin in the&#xD;
      circulation during the physiological cell turnover, thus making its urinary appearance&#xD;
      unlikely. However, recent studies indicate that actin could be detected in the urine of&#xD;
      kidney-transplant patients with acute kidney injury. Therefore, the main focus of our&#xD;
      research was the detection and measurement of actin in the blood and urine in patients with&#xD;
      sepsis or sepsis-related acute kidney injury, as the early recognition of kidney injury -&#xD;
      especially in sepsis - is essential in the aspect of therapy and survival.&#xD;
