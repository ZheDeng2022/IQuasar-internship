  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the role of IL-17 in the development of entheseal-driven pathology, a therapeutic&#xD;
      strategy aimed at blocking IL-17 would be a logical option for the treatment of enthesitis in&#xD;
      psoriatic arthritis patients. This study will be the first randomized trial of a biologic&#xD;
      therapy in participants with psoriatic arthritis, using imaging test.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in the Madrid Sonographic Enthesis Index (MASEI) ultrasound enthesitis score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline，Week 12 and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Twelve entheses will be scored in terms of inflammatory and morphological components according to the OMERACT enthesitis composite semi-quantitative scale (0 to 3). The lowest OMERACT score a participant can have at baseline is 1 (based on Inclusion Criterion, which requires at least 1 points in the B-mode or the Doppler mode in at least one active enthesis ). The highest OMERACT score expected at baseline will be 136, assuming that each of the 12 entheses assessed shows a maximum of 3 points in the gray scale score, and a maximum of 3 points in the Doppler score.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in the OMERACT Heel Enthesitis MRI Scoring System(HEMRIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Heel Entheses will be scored in terms of inflammatory and morphological components according to the RAMRIS and PsAMRIS composite semi-quantitative scale (0 to 3). The lowest HEMRIS score a participant can have at baseline is 0. The highest HEMRIS score expected at baseline will be 6, assuming that the heel entheses assessed shows a maximum of 3 points in inflammatory score, and a maximum of 3 points in structure damage.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in the PsASon13 unilateral ultrasound composite score of synovitis</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline，Week 12 and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Joints examined by the PsASon13 unilateral ultrasound composite score: Small finger joints: MCP2, MCP5, H-PIP1, H-PIP2, H-PIP3; Distal interphalangeal finger joints: H-DIP3; Small joints of feet: MTP1, MTP5, F-PIP1; Distal interphalangeal joints of feet: F-DIP2, F-DIP3; Large joints: wrist and knee. Lowest score a participant may have at baseline is 0. Highest score a participant may have at baseline is 184 (5 small finger joints, each ranging from 0 to 18; 1 distal interphalangeal finger joint, each ranging from 0 to 16; 3 small joints of feet, each ranging from 0 to 12; 2 distal interphalangeal joints of feet, each ranging from 0 to 12; 1 wrist ranging from 0 to 12; and 1 knee ranging from 0 to 6). Largest change expected from baseline to Week 16 is -118 points (improvement).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of patients achieving ACR20、ACR50 and ACR70 response.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline，Week 12 and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The ACR is a standard criteria originally developed to measure the effectiveness of various arthritis medications or treatments in clinical trials for RA, but is also widely used in PsA. The ACR measures improvement in tender joint count (TJC) or swollen joint count (SJC), and improvement in at least 3 of the following 5 parameters: Patient Global Assessment (PtGA), Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity (PhGA), physical function (using HAQ-DI) and acute phase reactant (using CRP). ACR 20 response is achieved if ≥ 20%≥ 50%/≥ 70% improvement in tender joint count (TJC) or swollen joint count (SJC) as well as a ≥ 20%/≥ 50%/≥ 70% improvement in ≥ 3 of the other 5 parameters.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants who achieve Psoriasis Area and Severity Index 75 (PASI 75)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline，Week 12 and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Scores range from 0 to 72. A score of more than 10 generally translates to &quot;moderate-to-severe&quot;. Usually, the higher your PASI score, the lower the quality of life. A PASI 75 is at least a 90% improvement (reduction) in PASI score.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>A 10-item measure to assess health-related quality of life in adults with skin diseases. Scores range from 0-30 with a higher score being less quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in HAQ-DI score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) is a 20-question scale assessing functional ability. The final HAQ-DI score ranges from 0 (no problems functioning) to 3 (not able to function).</description>
