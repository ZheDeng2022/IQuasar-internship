      The aim of this study was to identify and validate novel biomarkers including functional&#xD;
      tests for detecting AKI, AKI progression and other poor outcomes.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury (CSA-AKI) is the second most common type of&#xD;
      AKI after septic AKI and is associated with increased mortality and morbidity. The&#xD;
      progression of AKI with multiple organ failure can result in poor outcomes. Several novel&#xD;
      biomarkers for earlier detection of AKI, discrimination of etiologies, and prediction of&#xD;
      outcomes were developed. However, the availability of these novel biomarkers may be limited&#xD;
      by its expense or reimbursement issues in different countries. In present study, we conduct a&#xD;
      large cohort to identify and validate novel biomarkers including functional tests for&#xD;
      detecting AKI, AKI progression and other poor outcomes.&#xD;

    <description>worsening of KDIGO stage or death within 1 week (progressing from stage 1 to either stage 2 or stage 3, or from stage 2 to stage 3).&#xD;
Patients diagnosed with progressive or persisting stage 3 AKI (stage 3 AKI for &gt;3 consecutive days) were classified as having AKI progression.&#xD;
If patients who presented with stage 3 AKI but not requiring RRT subsequently required dialysis or developing persist severe AKI or death within 7 days, this was considered progression.</description>

    <description>MAKE was defined as the composite of≥25% loss in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), dialysis, or death. Estimated GFR was calculated from serum creatinine using the MDRD equation</description>

    <description>Persistent AKI is characterized by the continuance of AKI by serum creatinine or urine output criteria (as defined by KDIGO) beyond 48h from AKI onset.</description>

    <measure>Persist severe AKI</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Persistent severe AKI was defined as follows: Patients with stage 3 AKI at enrollment required a persistence of 72 hours or more to meet the end point.&#xD;
Patients enrolled at stage 2 AKI required a progression to stage 3 within 48 hours and a persistence at stage 3 for 72 consecutive hours to be considered end point positive.&#xD;
Additionally, patients with severe AKI who failed to achieve 72 hours due to death or the initiation of RRT were considered end point positive.</description>

      Serial blood and urine samples for biomarker analysis were collected after surgery and then&#xD;
      every 6 h in day 1 and then daily until discharge from ICU or for a maximum of 7 days,&#xD;
      respectively. Plasma (EDTA), serum, and urine supernatants were frozen within 2 h of sample&#xD;
      collection, stored at -80℃, and thawed immediately before analysis.&#xD;

        The incidence of cardiac surgery-associated AKI (CSA-AKI) varies from 5% to 42%. CSA-AKI is&#xD;
        the second most common cause of AKI in the intensive care setting (after sepsis) and is&#xD;
        independently associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Patients was diagnosed AKI&#xD;
        by KDIGO criteria.&#xD;
