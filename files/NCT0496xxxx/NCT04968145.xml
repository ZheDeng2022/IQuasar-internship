    <textblock>
      A single center randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of a post-discharge mobile&#xD;
      health application on 30-day re-admission and patient reported outcomes following elective&#xD;
      colorectal surgery&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Following elective colorectal surgery, rates of re-admission are high and result&#xD;
      in significant healthcare resource use. However, up to 20% of these re-admissions may be&#xD;
      preventable. This represents an opportunity to improve patient outcomes, reduce health care&#xD;
      utilization and costs through targeted interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Home To Stay is an integrated discharge monitoring program using a mobile app platform that&#xD;
      was developed to support the needs of patients following discharge after colorectal surgery.&#xD;
      In the initial pilot testing, the 30-day re-admission rate for patients using Home to Stay&#xD;
      was reduced from 18% to 6% and patient anxiety was reduced in over 75% of the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This study is a two arm, single center, randomized control trial that will be&#xD;
      conducted in the colorectal unit of an academic tertiary care center. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomized1:1 using a single randomized consent design to either usual follow up in the&#xD;
      control group or post discharge monitoring with Home to Stay in the intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The objective of this study is to evaluate the Home to Stay app and its effect on&#xD;
      healthcare utilization and patient reported outcomes.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Home To Stay Mobile Health Application</intervention_name>
    <description>Home to stay is an integrated discharge monitoring system with a mobile application. Features of the application include a &quot;Daily Health Check&quot; to report on post-operative recovery, picture taking capability to photograph incisions/wounds and educational information on post-operative care at home.&#xD;
Patients will complete a &quot;Daily Health Check&quot; on post-discharge Day #1-14, #21 and #30. The Daily Health Check consists of a series of questions specific to colorectal surgery as well as the Quality of Recovery (QoR-15) questionnaire. After completion, the participant will receive a list of recommendations tailored to their responses including relevant education modules, to contact the surgical team or in urgent cases to go to the nearest emergency room. The participants' responses will be monitored daily via a secure web site. Any participants' responses in the extreme ranges are automatically &quot;red flagged&quot; and notify the health care team that a follow up telephone call is required.</description>
