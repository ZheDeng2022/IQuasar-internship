    <textblock>
      The proGait-study is a two-arm exercise intervention study for AYA-patients with lower&#xD;
      extremity tumor endoprosthesis in the follow-up care. This clinical trial will investigate&#xD;
      the effects of an 8-week personalized multi-modal exercise intervention of lower extremity&#xD;
      muscles on gait quality in adolescents and young adults with cancer diagnosis beginning at&#xD;
      least 12 months after endoprosthesis implantation.&#xD;

      The main objective of the proGait-study is to investigate the effects of an 8-week&#xD;
      personalized, partially supervised exercise program for lower extremity muscles on gait&#xD;
      kinematics of adolescents and young adults, who are in follow-up care after cancer treatment&#xD;
      and at least 12 months after endoprosthesis implantation. This randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      will include n=20-30 patients. Patients will be randomly assigned to the intervention or&#xD;
      control group. Patients in the intervention group will perform two supervised exercise&#xD;
      sessions in week one and two. In the following weeks, they will perform in a mix of&#xD;
      supervised and unsupervised exercise sessions to introduce the patients into independent&#xD;
      exercise. Both groups receive recommendations for individual lower extremity exercise.&#xD;
      Secondary aims of this interventional study are to evaluate functional mobility, knee range&#xD;
      of motion and patient-reported outcomes including QoL and fatigue.&#xD;

    <description>Marker based 3D gait analysis is performed on a 15m runway and recorded at 120Hz with 8 cameras from different projection angles around the runway (Vicon, Oxford, UK). Gait Profile Score is based on the averaged RMS differences in lower body kinematics (Pelvis tilt ant/post, Pelvis tilt up/down, Pelvis internal rotation/external rotation, Hip joint flexion/extension, Hip joint adduction/abduction, Hip joint internal rotation/external rotation, Knee flexion/extension, Ankle joint Dorsiflexion/Plantarflexion, Foot opening angle Internal rotation/External rotation) of subjects and kinematic reference data from a healthy population during a time normalized gait cycle. A lower GPS would indicate less deviation from a healthy populations gait pattern and thus indicate a better outcome.</description>

    <description>Changes in lower body gait kinematics between both study arms from T0 to T1 by assessing the Gait Deviation Index (GDI), measure of difference between subjects and a healthy control dataset of lower body kinematics. A GDI of 100 indicates a subject whose gait is at least as close to the healthy average as that of a randomly selected healthy individual. Thus, a GDI of 100 or higher indicates the absence of gait pathology. Every 10 points that the GDI falls below 100 corresponds one standard deviation away from the healthy populations mean.</description>
