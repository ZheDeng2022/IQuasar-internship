  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity appears to be an important lifestyle habit to achieve healthy aging by&#xD;
      promoting autonomy and quality of life. Interestingly, the dramatic changes that the human&#xD;
      body undergoes due to bedrest for illnesses and hospitalization are similar to those seen&#xD;
      over decades of normal aging. Bedrest in otherwise healthy older individuals can lead to a&#xD;
      reduction of muscle size and strength, changes in bone strength and function of the heart and&#xD;
      blood vessels. Bedrest can also lead to changes in keeping proper balance as well as changes&#xD;
      in processing and understanding information. All of these factors negatively affect&#xD;
      activities of daily living leading to physical function impairment and development of&#xD;
      frailty, a clinical condition associated with an increased risk for disease and death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether exercise can counteract the negative&#xD;
      effects of 2-week head tilt down bed rest on muscle function and metabolism, postural&#xD;
      control, bone structure, orthostatic tolerance and cognitive function in adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study the investigators will recruit 24 healthy men and women between 55 - 65 years&#xD;
      of age. All subjects will spend a total of 26 days (5 days of adaption period, 14 days of bed&#xD;
      rest with 6 degrees of downward inclination, and 7 days of recovery period) at the McGill&#xD;
      University Health Centre (MUHC). During this study, 12 subjects will randomly undergo an&#xD;
      exercise intervention as countermeasure during the 14 days of bed rest period and 12 will&#xD;
      serve as control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subjects participation in this study will involve 1 telephone call (pre-screening) and 4&#xD;
      visits at the MUHC: 1 screening visit (Visit 1) followed by a 26-day long visit (Visit 2) and&#xD;
      2 follow-up visits (Visit 3 and Visit 4). During Visits 2 - 4 various measurements will be&#xD;
      performed to assess sensorimotor control, muscle function and metabolism, bone structure,&#xD;
      cardiovascular function, cognitive performance and function, and specimen collection (blood,&#xD;
      urine, saliva, feces and muscle tissue).&#xD;
