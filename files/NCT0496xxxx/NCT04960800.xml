  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diastasis Rectus abdominis is a common condition in pregnant and postpartum women, where the&#xD;
      connective tissue between the two muscle bellies of the rectus abdominis muscle is stretched&#xD;
      and weakened, causing an increased inter-rectus distance. Treatment of this condition aim to&#xD;
      reduce the inter-rectus distance, and conservative treatment including therapeutic exercise&#xD;
      is the primary treatment of choice. To date, there is no generally accepted protocol of&#xD;
      therapeutic exercises for this condition, and the evidence as to which exercise modality is&#xD;
      the most effective and feasible in reducing the inter-rectus distance in women presenting&#xD;
      with diastasis rectus abdominis is both sparse and weak. As this condition occur during the&#xD;
      last two trimesters of pregnancy and as there is a paucity of high-quality studies on a&#xD;
      pregnant population, investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial on the effect&#xD;
      of a specific exercise program during pregnancy on diastasis rectus abdominis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      100 pregnant women in gestation week 25 presenting with diastasis rectus abdominis of â‰¥ 28 mm&#xD;
      will be included. Participants will be allocated to either an intervention group or a control&#xD;
      group by block randomization. The intervention group will participate in a 12-week specific&#xD;
      exercise program, consisting of two group sessions and two self-managed sessions weekly. The&#xD;
      control group will not participate in any exercise intervention; however, participants will&#xD;
      be recommended to follow national guidelines for general exercise during pregnancy.&#xD;
      Participants will be assessed prior to intervention, post intervention at gestation week 37,&#xD;
      and 6 weeks, 6 and 12 months postpartum. The primary outcome measure will be change in the&#xD;
      inter-rectus distance in mm, measured by two-dimensional ultrasonography.&#xD;

    <masking_description>To ensure randomization to the two groups in the RCT, participants will, following baseline assessments, be allocated to the two groups by block randomization. Blocking will be masked and not stated in the protocol to avoid selection bias. The group allocation will be administrated by a research assistant, to ensure blinding of the assessor. This study is assessor blinded only, as participants and the physiotherapist running the intervention groups cannot be blinded.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The primary outcome measure will be change in inter-rectus distance in mm, measured by two-dimensional ultrasonography.</measure>
    <time_frame>All participants will be assessed prior to intervention start in gestation week 27. They will then be reassessed at end of the intervention period at gestation week 37. Assessments will also be done 6 weeks, 6 and 12 months postpartum.</time_frame>
    <description>The inter-rectus distance is the distance between the two muscle bulks of the rectus abdominis muscle. As the two muscle bulks are connected through the connective tissue Linea Alba, the inter-rectus distance is equivalent to the width of the line alba.The inter-rectus distance is measured 2 cm above and 2 cm below the umbilicus. Images of the inter-rectus distance is taken using 2-dimensional ultrasound, and measured using the free Microdicom software. Measurements will be done in mm.</description>

    <description>The participants in the intervention group will participate in a 12- week specific exercise programme led by an experienced women's health physiotherapist. These groups will take place at a private physiotherapy clinic twice a week. In addition, the participants will carry out a self-managed exercise program twice weekly for the same 12-week period. They will be provided with an exercise diary so that adherence to the intervention can be registered and monitored. This exercise diary will be sent to the participants once a week as an electronic questionnaire; this will ensure that the information recorded is standardized and that the research assistant can aid the participants to register their activity and encourage the participants to adhere to the intervention.</description>
