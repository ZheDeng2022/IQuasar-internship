  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A retrospective analysis was performed on patients with partial-thickness rotator cuff tendon&#xD;
      tears who underwent arthroscopic surgery from August 2006 to December 2011. To evaluate&#xD;
      functional outcomes and tendon healing after arthroscopy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To study the surgical method and clinical effect of arthroscopic treatment of rotator cuff&#xD;
      tendon tear. Retrospective analysis was performed on patients with rotator cuff tendon tears&#xD;
      who underwent arthroscopic surgery from August 2006 to December 2011. Preoperative X-ray and&#xD;
      MRI were performed. Rotator cuff repair was performed during the operation. UCLA shoulder&#xD;
      scoring scale was used to evaluate the shoulder joint at preoperative and final follow-up.&#xD;
