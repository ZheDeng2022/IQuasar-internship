    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effect of a peripheral acting opioid antagonist (PAMORA) on&#xD;
      the disease course of patients with recurrent acute inflammation of the pancreas (acute&#xD;
      pancreatitis). The study will be conducted by treating outpatients suffering from recurrent&#xD;
      acute pancreatitis with a PAMORA (naldemedine) for 12 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the effects of a peripheral acting µ-opioid receptor antagonist (PAMORA) on&#xD;
      disease recurrence and progression in patients with recurrent acute pancreatitis (RAP) will&#xD;
      be investigated. Patients with RAP will be administered 0,2 mg naldemedine orally daily or&#xD;
      matching placebo. This medication is defined as the investigational product. Naldemedine is&#xD;
      approved by the European Medical Agency for treatment of opioid-induced constipation. This&#xD;
      PAMORA have not previously been investigated in patients with pancreatitis. The dose regimes&#xD;
      for this study will be according to label. It has previously been shown, in patients with&#xD;
      opioid-induced obstipation and healthy subjects, that opioid antagonism incl. PAMORA&#xD;
      treatment increases gut motility, relaxes gastrointestinal sphincters, increases the&#xD;
      intestinal water content and improves the immune response, without affecting analgesia. The&#xD;
      affinity of PAMORAs to the µ-opioid receptors is much stronger than opioid analgesics.&#xD;
      Therefore, they as antagonists have the potential to counteract the harmful effects of&#xD;
      opioids on the gut mucosa, bacterial translocation and inflammation despite the high levels&#xD;
      of exogenous opioids present in patients with pancreatitis. PAMORAs do not cross the&#xD;
      blood-brain barrier and consequently do not interfere with analgesia or other central effects&#xD;
      of opioids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that treatment with the PAMORA naldemedine will antagonize the harmful&#xD;
      effects of opioids without reducing analgesia in patients with RAP and hence reduce disease&#xD;
      severity and improve clinical outcomes. If successful, this study will for the first time&#xD;
      document the effects of a targeted pharmacotherapy in RAP with the potential benefit of&#xD;
      improved patient outcomes.&#xD;

    <measure>Number of AP attacks verified by the Atlanta Criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>Observation period starts from day of randomization and ends after 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome is defined as difference in number of AP attacks verified by the Atlanta Criteria between the naldemedine group and the placebo group.&#xD;
The Atlanta Criteria is the current gold standard for the diagnosis of AP attack, and it requires a minimum of two out three of the following features:&#xD;
(i) Abdominal pain typical for acute pancreatitis featuring acute onset of a severe and persistent epigastric pain radiating to the back (ii) Serum amylase levels &gt; three times greater than the normal upper limit (iii) Findings of pancreatic inflammation in contrast-enhanced computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging or transabdominal ultrasonography.</description>

    <measure>Pain intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>Observation period starts from day of randomization and ends after 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Individual difference between subgroups in number and severity of pain attacks (without fulfilling AP criteria) assessed by pain diary and modified Brief Pain Inventory short form on visual analogue scale from 0-10 (0 is no pain and 10 is worst pain). For each attack, participants will be asked to fill in the pain attack diary and the modified Brief Pain Inventory short form once.</description>

    <time_frame>Day of randomization and at follow up visit after 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Difference between subgroups in quality of life assessed by EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. The questionnaire has been validated for assessment of quality of life in patients with chronic pancreatitis and is composed of single-item measures and multi-item scales with scores ranging from 0 to 100 after linear transformation of the raw score. A high score for a functional scale represents a high level of functioning, as does a high score for the global health status, while a high score for the symptom items represents a high level of symptomatology.</description>
