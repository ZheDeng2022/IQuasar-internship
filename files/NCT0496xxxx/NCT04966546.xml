  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Subdural Hematoma (cSDH) is an extremely common problem, particularly in the aging&#xD;
      population, where fluid like collections compress the brain, frequently requiring surgical&#xD;
      drainage. After drainage, 25-50% of patients experience post operative neurologic deficits&#xD;
      such as weakness or confusion that are often not explained by problems such as seizure,&#xD;
      stroke, or mass effect from the fluid and blood. Recent subdural recordings have demonstrated&#xD;
      that some of these neurological deficits may be related to waves of spreading depolarization&#xD;
      (SD), which cause temporary neurological dysfunction. Our overall objective is to examine the&#xD;
      relationship between neurological deficits and SD and to assess feasibility of a pilot trial&#xD;
      to determine if a strategy of NMDA-R antagonism can effectively reduce SD and improve&#xD;
      clinical recovery.&#xD;

      1. Objectives 1.1. Assess risk factors for SD and seizures 1.2. Compare clinical outcomes&#xD;
           between patients with SD and without 1.3. Obtain preliminary data on safety and efficacy&#xD;
           of Memantine in subjects with SD 1.4. Assess early temporal relationship between SD and&#xD;
           neurological deficits 1.5. Compare clinical outcomes between subjects with seizure and&#xD;
           without&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Background&#xD;
&#xD;
           Chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH) represents a unique phenotype of traumatic brain injury&#xD;
           (TBI) occurring almost exclusively in elderly patients. Chronic Subdural Hematoma (cSDH)&#xD;
           is estimated to become the most common condition treated by neurosurgeons by 2030(1).&#xD;
           Surgical evacuation is the mainstay of treatment, and though most patients recover with&#xD;
           a straightforward course, up to 50% of patients develop postoperative neurological&#xD;
           deficits or impaired recovery (2, 3). Though some of these events may be related to&#xD;
           seizures or other metabolic changes(3), we recently demonstrated that spreading&#xD;
           depolarization (SD) is definitively demonstrated in at least 15% of patients after&#xD;
           surgical evacuation and are closely linked to postoperative neurological deficits(4).&#xD;
           NMDA-R antagonists are a promising treatment for inhibiting SD, and we performed the&#xD;
           first prospective study demonstrating dose dependent inhibition of SD with ketamine(5).&#xD;
           Further, a recent randomized controlled trial demonstrated efficacy of memantine (a&#xD;
           related NMDA-R antagonist) in neurologic recovery after moderate traumatic brain injury&#xD;
           (6). What is not known is whether postoperative neurologic deficits and subsequent&#xD;
           impaired recovery are explained by an SD dependent mechanism. There is a critical need&#xD;
           to assess this mechanistic link with SD and neurological recovery after cSDH evacuation&#xD;
           in order to develop effective targeted therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Our long-term goal is to develop effective SD targeted therapies to improve recovery&#xD;
           after cSDH evacuation and other neurologic injuries. The overall objective of this&#xD;
           project, which is the necessary next step toward attainment of this long-term goal, is&#xD;
           to assess for the overall relationship between SD and clinical outcomes. The central&#xD;
           hypothesis is that SD plays a causal role in postoperative neurologic deficits after&#xD;
           cSDH evacuation and therefore could be a therapeutic target. This hypothesis was&#xD;
           formulated based on several key pieces of preliminary data: 1) We have demonstrated that&#xD;
           SD occurs after cSDH evacuation and is closely related to postoperative neurological&#xD;
           deficits. 2) We have demonstrated prospectively that a strategy of NMDA-R antagonism can&#xD;
           inhibit SD after brain injury. The rationale that underlies the proposed research is&#xD;
           that the temporal and long-term clinical outcomes, as they relate to SD, must be better&#xD;
           defined. Further, in order to ultimately perform a randomized trial for efficacy, pilot&#xD;
           data are needed to assess feasibility and appropriate outcome measures and timing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study Design 3.1. Observational study with nested randomized controlled trial 3.1.1. All&#xD;
           subjects undergoing surgery for chronic or subacute subdural hematoma will be screened&#xD;
           for participation. The determination of the nature of the Subdural Hematoma will be&#xD;
           based on the characteristic radiographic CT appearance of hypo or iso-attenuation of&#xD;
           fluid in the subdural space with or without membranes and with or without &lt;50% acute&#xD;
           component. A 1x6 recording electrode will be placed for clinical monitoring at the time&#xD;
           of surgery and left in place for 1-2 days after surgery. This will allow for recording&#xD;
           of spreading depolarizations and seizures. Seizures will be treated as clinically&#xD;
           indicated and provide additional potential benefit for these subjects. Subjects will&#xD;
           initially be enrolled in an observational study focused on identifying risk factors for&#xD;
           SD and poor outcomes. If SD is detected, subjects who consent will be randomized to a&#xD;
           nested blinded pilot trial of the effect of a 7 day course of Memantine 10 mg compared&#xD;
           to identical placebo on both ECoG (electrocorticography) and clinical outcomes. Patients&#xD;
           may or may not undergo middle meningeal artery embolization per standard clinical&#xD;
           recommendation. This will not be affected by participation in the study in any way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1.2. Dose Selection Rationale Memantine usually start as 5 mg and titrate up to maximum&#xD;
      dose of 20 mg per day. In this trial we will randomize to Memantine vs Placebo with dose of&#xD;
      10 mg BID without titration. The lack of titration is based on the requirement for acute&#xD;
      action rather than chronic actions over a short interval. The study by Mokhtari et al used&#xD;
      the same approach without titration. Multiple additional studies with similar and higher dose&#xD;
      Memantine without titration are summarized in below table.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Published studies with higher dose Memantine without titration:&#xD;
&#xD;

      physical dependance 60mg PO prior to naloxone challenge Single dose None (BP, HR, 02 sat&#xD;
      similar. Improved withdrawal symptoms after naloxone admin) Swerdlow, 2009 RCT Normal&#xD;

      Healthy volunteers Discrimination of methamphatamine dosing 40mg Single dose None, less&#xD;
      irritability with memantine Collins, 2007 RCT Cocaine users Cocaine pretreatment 60mg Single&#xD;

      wk Dizziness, HA, malaise, loss of consciousness, somnolence, weight gain, poor energy,&#xD;
      imbalance, worse tremor Ferguson, 2007 Open label study with flexible dose Major depressive&#xD;
      disorder Depressive symptoms Up to 40mg/day 10 weeks Somnolence, dizziness, insomnia Cekman,&#xD;
      2011 Case report Overdose Unintended 2000mg Single dose Sleepiness and coma. Tachycardia,&#xD;
      hypertension, respiratory alkalosis, seizure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treated with plasmapheresis and DC home without sequelae&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1.3. Allocation of Treatment and Randomization This is a nested Randomized Double Blinded&#xD;
      Study within the observational study, once the SD is detected, subjects who consent will be&#xD;
      randomized to a nested blinded pilot trial of the effect of a 7 day course of memantine 10 mg&#xD;
      BID compared to identical placebo on both ECoG and clinical outcomes. The research pharmacist&#xD;
      will be the only unblinded participant unless any safety concerns arise. All other&#xD;
      study-related personnel, hospital care givers, and the patient will remain blinded.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>We do not anticipate generating any unique resources during the completion of the aims of this proposal.&#xD;
The PI and team are strongly committed to the sharing of resources, experimental details and findings, in order to facilitate replication studies and collaboration. We will therefore make the results and procedures from our study widely available. This will include dissemination through the COSBID network of SD investigators (www.cosbid.org), presentations at national meetings focused on brain injury, and study results will be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals and made available via PubMed Central.</ipd_description>
