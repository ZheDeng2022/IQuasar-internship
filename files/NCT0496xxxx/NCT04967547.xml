  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peritoneal dialysis is an effective renal replacement therapy with higher quality of life and&#xD;
      lower treatment cost than hemodialysis.However, the application rate of peritoneal dialysis&#xD;
      is much lower than that of hemodialysis. One of the reasons is that patients need to complete&#xD;
      fluid changing operation independently, which is especially challenging for elderly and frail&#xD;
      patients. Assisted peritoneal dialysis can help patients with independent dialysis disorders&#xD;
      to complete dialysis. Currently, there is a lack of standard tools to assess patients'&#xD;
      ability to conduct independent dialysis and to determine whether assisted dialysis is needed.&#xD;
      Moreover, routine assessment is arranged after the training of dialysis operation, which&#xD;
      leads to some patients giving up the procedure at an early stage, resulting in a low&#xD;
      selection rate of the procedure.The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of&#xD;
      using a standard scale to evaluate the ability to perform abdominal dialysis in patients with&#xD;
      stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) before deciding on dialysis modality.&#xD;
