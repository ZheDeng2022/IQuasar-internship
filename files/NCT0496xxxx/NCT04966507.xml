  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine acceptability and preliminary efficacy of daily use of an&#xD;
      antibacterial mouthwash as compared to a placebo mouthwash in reducing the incidence of&#xD;
      pharyngeal gonorrhea among a cohort of HIV-positive and high risk HIV-negative men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators plan to test the following hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Participants will maintain a high level of adherence and satisfaction with daily&#xD;
           mouthwash use. Furthermore, the investigators hypothesize that barriers to adherence&#xD;
           will include structural factors such as unstable housing and individual level factors&#xD;
           such as substance use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Participants receiving the antibacterial mouthwash will have a lower incidence of&#xD;
           pharyngeal gonorrhea as compared to participants receiving the placebo mouthwash.&#xD;
           Furthermore, the investigators hypothesize that these reductions will remain even after&#xD;
           adjusting for other factors such as HIV-status and substance use.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will build on the NIH/NIDA funded mSTUDY (U01 DA036267 PIs Gorbach and&#xD;
      Shoptaw), which is a longitudinal study designed to assess the impact of substance use and&#xD;
      HIV on minority MSM. Participants in the proposed study will be those enrolled in the mSTUDY&#xD;
      and the objectives of this study are to measure the preliminary efficacy and acceptability of&#xD;
      antibacterial mouthwash use for the prevention of pharyngeal gonorrhea among a cohort of high&#xD;
      risk HIV-negative and HIV-positive MSM. In order to achieve this goal the investigators&#xD;
      propose to conduct a double-blind, randomized, crossover trial of daily antibacterial&#xD;
      mouthwash use as compared to a placebo mouthwash among mSTUDY participants at high risk for&#xD;
      pharyngeal gonorrhea (i.e. previously diagnosed with pharyngeal gonorrhea). Participants will&#xD;
      be followed for a total of 24 weeks, with each participant receiving 12-weeks of&#xD;
      antibacterial mouthwash and 12-weeks of placebo mouthwash.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After providing written informed consent, participants will complete a computer-based&#xD;
      questionnaire, provide biological specimen, and will be randomly allocated to their study&#xD;
      group. The study survey will include questions that are collected as part of mSTUDY as well&#xD;
      as questions relevant to the proposed study. Following the questionnaire, participants will&#xD;
      provide a bio-specimen for STI testing including: (1) urine, for chlamydia and gonorrhea&#xD;
      testing; (2) rectal and pharyngeal swabs for gonorrhea and chlamydia testing; and (3) blood,&#xD;
      which is used for syphilis and HIV testing, and HIV-1 RNA levels (for HIV-positive).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly allocated to either first receive a 12-week antibacterial&#xD;
      mouthwash followed by 12-weeks of placebo mouthwash or start with 12-weeks of placebo&#xD;
      mouthwash and crossover to 12-weeks of antibacterial mouthwash. The antibacterial mouthwash&#xD;
      and placebo are commercially available products (Cool Mint Listerine® Antiseptic mouthwash&#xD;
      and Biotene® Oral Rinse respectively) and are selected based on evidence demonstrating&#xD;
      inhibitory effects of the antibacterial mouthwash (Cool Mint Listerine® Antiseptic mouthwash)&#xD;
      against N. gonorrhoeae. In order to ensure concealment of study allocation and to allow for&#xD;
      blinding, the following procedures will be instituted:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the investigators will generate a computerized randomization sequence (active condition&#xD;
           first, placebo second or placebo first, active condition second). The randomization&#xD;
           sequence will be linked to the study identification number and maintained by study staff&#xD;
           not involved in participant contact or data management/analysis;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the mouthwash will be in bottles in such a way to ensure that the placebo and active&#xD;
           product have an identical look. While the products packaging will have a similar look a&#xD;
           label with the study ID will allow us to link the bottle to the content. At the time of&#xD;
           study enrollment, all participants will receive a 12-week supply of mouthwash according&#xD;
           to their randomized study group (antibacterial or placebo) and will be instructed on how&#xD;
           to rinse and gargle with the mouthwash on a daily basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When participants return for the 12-week visit, they will receive another 12-week supply,&#xD;
      which will be the crossover condition to what was assigned at baseline. Participants will be&#xD;
      instructed to stop using any other mouthwash they may have been using prior to study&#xD;
      enrollment. All participants will be asked to return to the study site for a 12-week&#xD;
      follow-up visit. This visit is a study specific visit and is the only visit of the three&#xD;
      study visits that does not overlap with an mSTUDY follow-up visit. Participants will be asked&#xD;
      to complete a computer-based survey to collect information comparable to what was collected&#xD;
      at baseline including information on sexual behaviors, substance use, and oral hygiene&#xD;
      practices. Additionally, participants will be asked to complete questions regarding study&#xD;
      mouthwash us including frequency and timing of mouthwash use (i.e., intervention fidelity)&#xD;
      and acceptability of mouthwash. Pharyngeal swabs will be collected in order to test for&#xD;
      gonorrhea including nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) and culture testing. All&#xD;
      participants will be asked to return in 12-weeks (i.e., 24-weeks from baseline) which will&#xD;
      coincide with an mSTUDY visit and data collection procedures from baseline will be repeated&#xD;
      including laboratory testing for STIs and survey administration.&#xD;
