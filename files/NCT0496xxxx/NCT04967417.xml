      This is a Phase II single center, open-label, single arm study in patients with advanced&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer (stage IV) with brain metastases. Patients will be treated with&#xD;
      combination of Pembrolizumab 200mg plus platinum doublet based on histology subtypes. After&#xD;
      the 4 cycles of combination phase with cytotoxic chemotherapy, maintenance phase will be&#xD;
      followed for maximum of 35 cycles. If the disease progression is observed in CNS only which&#xD;
      can be controlled with local treatment, systemic treatment can be continued as beyond disease&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male/female participants who are at least 19 years of age on the day of signing&#xD;

             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive&#xD;
             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a&#xD;
             form of systemic treatment and is allowed.&#xD;

             prophylactic treatment based on the investigator's decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality&#xD;
             that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the participant's&#xD;
             participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of&#xD;
             the participant to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
