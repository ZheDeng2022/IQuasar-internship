  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lower limbs of stroke patients gradually recover through Brunnstrom stages, from initial&#xD;
      flaccid status to gradually increased spasticity, and eventually decreased spasticitiy.&#xD;
      Throughout this process. after stroke patients can start walking, their gait will show&#xD;
      abnormal gait patterns from healthy subjects, including circumduction gait, drop foot, hip&#xD;
      hiking and genu recurvatum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For these abnormal gait patterns, rehabilitation methods include ankle-knee orthosis(AFO) or&#xD;
      increasing knee/pelvic joint mobility for assistance. Prior to this study, similar research&#xD;
      has been done to differentiate stroke gait patterns from normal gait patterns, with an&#xD;
      accuracy of over 96%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study recruits subject who has encountered first ever cerebrovascular incident and can&#xD;
      currently walk independently on flat surface without assistance, and investigators record&#xD;
      gait information via inertial measurement units strapped to their bilateral ankle, wrist and&#xD;
      pelvis to detect acceleration and angular velocity as well as other gait parameters. The IMU&#xD;
      used in this study consists of a 3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis gyroscope and 3-axis&#xD;
      magnetometer, with a highest sampling rate of 128Hz.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Afterwards, investigators use these gait information collected as training data and testing&#xD;
      data for a deep neural network (DNN) model and compare clinical observation results by&#xD;
      physicians simultaneously, in order to determine whether the DNN model is able to&#xD;
      differentiate the types of abnormal gait patterns mentioned above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If this model is applied in the community, investigators hope it is available to early detect&#xD;
      abnormal gait patterns and perform early intervention to decrease possibility of fallen&#xD;
      injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a non-invasive observational study and doesn't involve medicine use. Participants are&#xD;
      only required to perform walking for 6 minutes without assistance on a flat surface. This&#xD;
      risk is extremely low and the only possible risk of this study is falling down during&#xD;
      walking.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Abnormal gait patterns can be observed among stroke patient who are able to start ambulation&#xD;
      training, including circumduction gait, drop foot, hip hiking and genu recurvatum. The first&#xD;
      6 months after a cerebrovascular incident is considered the golden period for post-stroke&#xD;
      rehabilitation, therefore intensive intervention during this period will provide significant&#xD;
      help to stroke patients. Currently, clinical treatment methods still heavily rely on&#xD;
      subjective diagnosis by physiatrists and therapists, therefore investigators hope by&#xD;
      establishing a more objective method to classify abnormal gait patterns, it will provide more&#xD;
      significant assistance during long term rehabilitation planning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this observational study, investigators plan to recruit 100 stroke patients with first&#xD;
      ever, unilateral stroke and are able to perform walking on a flat surface for 6 minutes&#xD;
      without assistance. Inclusion criteria includes age over 20 years old with first time stroke&#xD;
      and affected lower limb Brunnstrom stage III-V, and functional ambulation category VI.&#xD;
      Participants should be able to walk on a flat surface without assistance for 6 minutes and&#xD;
      their Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) should be over 25, which means participants can&#xD;
      comply to orders and cooperate with investigators in this study. Exclusion criteria includes&#xD;
      severe central nervous system (CNS)/peripheral neurological disorders apart from stroke, and&#xD;
      those with high risk of falling down during walking. Those who cannot cooperate with testing&#xD;
      and with severe visual/auditory/cognition deficits are also excluded. Patients with lower&#xD;
      limb fracture within recent 6 months are excluded as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators recruit participants from outpatient clinics as well as physical therapy rooms&#xD;
      and patients will not receive any extra medications before/after this gait study.&#xD;
      Participants will continue their physical therapy programs as well as medical regime without&#xD;
      any restriction by participating this study. The study method in this study is to strap&#xD;
      multiple inertial measurement units (IMUs) on participants' bilateral wrists, ankles and&#xD;
      pelvis, and participants are requested to walk indoors on a flat surface for 6 minutes under&#xD;
      their most comfortable pace. The IMUs used in this study consists of a 3-axis accelerometer,&#xD;
      3-axis gyroscope and 3-axis magnetometer, with a highest sampling rate of 128Hz. Non-invasive&#xD;
      orthosis such as ankle-foot orthosis (AFO) are allowed to increase gait stability and&#xD;
      symmetry. Meanwhile, experienced clinical physiatrists and physical therapists will record&#xD;
      whether the patients' gait patterns show abnormal gait patterns such as circumduction gait,&#xD;
      drop foot, hip hiking or back knee. The participants are allowed to leave after completion of&#xD;
      6 minute walking test without any discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A deep neural network (DNN) model is constructed to be trained for abnormal gait pattern&#xD;
      analysis. The DNN model constructed for this study consists of an input layer, 6 hidden&#xD;
      layers, detection output layer and classification output layer. Each hidden layer consists of&#xD;
      100 neurons and detection output layer will label each gait data as normal gait[1,0] or&#xD;
      stroke gait[0,1]. Afterwards, the classification layer will label each abnormal stroke gait&#xD;
      pattern as stroke gait, circumduction gait, drop foot, hip hiking and back knee as&#xD;
      [1,1,1,1,1]. After completion of collecting clinical gait data from participants in this&#xD;
      study, investigators use the collected gait data for DNN training, and investigators use&#xD;
      k-fold cross validation method to divide participants' gait data into 5 collections randomly,&#xD;
      with 4 of them used as training data while the remaining used as testing data, and the&#xD;
      testing will be repeated for 5 times. Then investigators will compare clinical observed&#xD;
      information done by physiatrists/therapists and DNN model results to see whether the DNN&#xD;
      model is available of differentiating circumduction gait, drop foot, hip hiking and genu&#xD;
      recurvatum.&#xD;

    <description>Investigators compare clinically observed abnormal gait patterns with DNN model detection. Accuracy of the DNN model will be compared to clinical observed data after cross validation, which results in a series of labeling. Investigators compare those labels with actual observed clinical abnormal gait patterns to determine whether DNN is available of identifying abnormal stroke gait patterns accurately.</description>
