  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urticaria is a common skin disorder and 15-25% of people experience at least one attack of&#xD;
      urticaria during their lifetime. Urticaria can be divided into acute urticaria (AU) and&#xD;
      chronic urticaria (CU). CU is more common in adults, and affects women more frequently than&#xD;
      men. According to Chinese medicine (CM) theory, CU is known as Yin Zhen. Nowadays, CM is&#xD;
      widely used for managing CU in Hong Kong and mainland. Among different Chinese herbal&#xD;
      formulae for urticaria, Xiao-Feng Powder (XFP), also known as Wind-Dispersing Powder, is one&#xD;
      of the most frequently used Chinese herbal formulae for CU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study used modified Xiao-Feng Powder (mXFP) to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of&#xD;
      mXFP in treating CU. Hence, a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trial&#xD;
      design with strong scientific rigor will be employed in this study, and it would be able to&#xD;
      provide robust clinical evidence on the efficacy and safety of mXFP for CU.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Urticaria is a common skin disorder and 15-25% of people experience at least one attack of&#xD;
      urticaria during their lifetime. Urticaria can be divided into acute urticaria (AU) and&#xD;
      chronic urticaria (CU) according to the disease duration. CU is classified as either chronic&#xD;
      autoimmune urticaria or chronic idiopathic urticaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Chinese medicine theory, Urticaria is usually associated with either internal or external&#xD;
      wind pathogen. Wind as a pathogenic factor is characterized by sudden onset and rapid changes&#xD;
      in symptoms, and when resulting from an internal deficiency, it often leads to dryness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several research groups have conducted clinical studies to evaluate the efficacy of Chinese&#xD;
      herbal medicine for the treatment of CU in recent decades. Among different Chinese herbal&#xD;
      formulae for urticaria, Xiao-Feng Powder (XFP), also known as Wind-Dispersing Powder, is one&#xD;
      of the most frequently used Chinese herbal formulae for CU, also has been widely used in&#xD;
      Chinese medicine dermatology to expel wind and eliminate dampness, clear heat, nourish the&#xD;
      blood and stop itchiness. Moreover, other researchers have found that XFP is effective in&#xD;
      inhibiting inflammation, allergy, and oxidative stress in allergic skin diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators hypothesize that mXFP is effective and safe for the treatment of CU. In this&#xD;
      study, eligible subjects will be randomized to receive either mXFP or placebo twice daily for&#xD;
      12 weeks followed by post-treatment visits at week 16. Subjects will take the standard&#xD;
      therapy of antihistamines regularly for the first 6 weeks and then on on-demand basis for the&#xD;
      next 6 weeks during the treatment period.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of Urticaria Activity Score (UAS7)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The UAS combines daily wheal numbers (0 = none, 1 = &lt; 20 wheals/24 h, 2 = 20-50 wheals/24 h, and 3= &gt; 50 wheals/24 h or large confluent areas of wheals), and pruritus intensity (0 = none, 1 = present but not annoying or troublesome, 2 = troublesome but does not interfere with normal daily activity or sleep, and 3 = severe pruritus, which is sufficiently troublesome to interfere with normal daily activity or sleep). The score ranges from 0 to 42 weekly. The highest score, the more severe of urticaria activity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of Urticaria Activity Score (UAS7)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks and 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The UAS combines daily wheal numbers (0 = none, 1 = &lt; 20 wheals/24 h, 2 = 20-50 wheals/24 h, and 3= &gt; 50 wheals/24 h or large confluent areas of wheals), and pruritus intensity (0 = none, 1 = present but not annoying or troublesome, 2 = troublesome but does not interfere with normal daily activity or sleep, and 3 = severe pruritus, which is sufficiently troublesome to interfere with normal daily activity or sleep).

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of Urticaria Control Test (UCT)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks, 12 weeks and 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It collects retrospective information about the symptoms and quality of life impairment over the past 4 weeks. The lowest UCT score possible is 0 (no control) and the highest score possible is 16 (complete control). A score ≥12 indicates well-controlled urticaria, while a score of ≤11 points towards poor disease control.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Change of Visual Analog Scale of Itch Severity (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks, 12 weeks and 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS is a scale consisting of a 10 cm long line for measuring itch intensity and it has high reliability and concurrent validity. The highest score, the more itchiness.</description>
