  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, real-world, registry study, which aims to observe the&#xD;
      intermediate and long-term efficacy of different endovascular treatments for TASC C&amp;D&#xD;
      aortoiliac occlusive disease.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, the optimal therapy for TASC C and D type aortic occlusive disease is still&#xD;
      controversial. The evidence comes from several singe-center studies with small sample size.&#xD;
      In addition, the long-term efficacy of stent implantation and drug coated device in aortic&#xD;
      occlusive disease remains unclear, which might be affected by the type of stent and&#xD;
      calcification extent. Thus, this study aims to observe the intermediate and long-term&#xD;
      efficacy of different endovascular treatments for TASC C&amp;D aortoiliac occlusive disease in&#xD;
      multiple centers.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Free from clinically-drived target lesion reintervention</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>TLR was deﬁned as a reintervention performed for &gt;50% diameter stenosis or in the target lesion after documentation of recurrent clinical symptoms following the index procedure or bailout stenting during the index procedure. Freedom form TLR were defined as the rates of the number of patients who did not receive reintervention verse the number of patients during the follow-up period.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Technique success rate</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Successfully revascularize the target vessel. The residual stenosis is &lt;30% and there is no acute thrombosis occurred in the target vessel within 30 days post-operation. The Technical success rate was defined as the rate of the number of patients who receive the treatment as intended verse the number of the patients enrolled.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perioperative adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Perioperative adverse events include anyone of the following: all-cause mortality, Myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, acute limb ischemia, and major amputation of a vascular etiology, and arterial thrombosis related to endovascular manipulation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Primary patency rate</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The primary patency rate was defined as the percentage of stent patency examined by ultrasonograpy or computed tomography angiography examination of lower limb arteries during follow-up.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of adverse blood supply events</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Incidence of adverse blood supply events include anyone of the following: acute or chronic occlusion of target lower extremity, major or minor amputation of a vascular etiology</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Vascular quality of life questionnaire(VascuQol)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The VascuQol was designed as a questionnaire containing five domains: pain (4 items), symptoms (4 items), activities (8 items), social (2 items), and emotional (7 items) to evaluate Health related quality of life (HRQL). Every item has seven response options, with scores ranging from 1 to 7. A total score is the sum of all 25 item scores divided by 25.And both the total score as well as the domain scores range from 1 (worst HRQL) to 7 (best HRQL).The lower the value, the poorer the quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Total Cost of treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years, 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>All the cost related to the target vessel and spent in the inpatient ward will be recorded and analyzed. Health economics evaluation</description>
