  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, cross-over designed clinical&#xD;
      trial investigating the effect of high-dose Coenzyme Q10 treatment in subjects with&#xD;
      persisting symptoms more than 12 weeks af SARS-CoV-2 infection, Long Term COVID-19 (LTC).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to investigate the effect of high-dose Coenzyme Q10 on number and severity of&#xD;
      self-reported symptoms in patients with Long Term COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted at the Department of Infectious Diseases, Aarhus University&#xD;
      Hospital in the LTC Outpatient Clinic. 120 study participants will be randomized 1:1 to&#xD;
      receive placebo or CoQ10 in a dose of 500mg/day for 6 weeks. After a wash-out period of 4&#xD;
      weeks, participants are allocated to the opposite treatment for 6 weeks. The EQ-5D-5L and an&#xD;
      LTC-specific questionnaire are completed at baseline and after 6,10,16, and 20 weeks. At each&#xD;
      of 5 visits blood samples will be collected from the participants for immunological&#xD;
      investigations and assessment of cellular metabolism.&#xD;
