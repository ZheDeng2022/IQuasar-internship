  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the effect of nivolumab and ADI-PEG 20 before surgery in treating&#xD;
      patients with liver cancer that can be removed by surgery (resectable). Immunotherapy with&#xD;
      monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the&#xD;
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. ADI-PEG 20 may&#xD;
      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the proteins needed for cell growth.&#xD;
      Giving nivolumab and ADI-PEG 20 before surgery may help control liver cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of therapy and assess the pathologic response rate&#xD;
      including pathologic complete response (pCR) and degree of necrosis (&gt; 50% in tumor volume)&#xD;
      with nivolumab + pegargiminase (ADI-PEG 20) in resectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in&#xD;
      the context of presurgical therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the efficacy of presurgical nivolumab + ADI-PEG 20 therapy in HCC by estimating&#xD;
      the time-to-progression (TTP), recurrence-free survival (RFS), and overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the immunological/biomarker changes (pre- versus [vs] post-treatment) in tumor&#xD;
      tissues and peripheral blood in response to nivolumab + ADI-PEG 20 in HCC therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To explore any potential association between these biomarker measures and antitumor&#xD;
      response and immune-related response criteria (irRC) assessed by MD Anderson Department of&#xD;
      Diagnostic Imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and pegargiminase&#xD;
      intramuscularly (IM) at 2 days before day 1 of cycle 1, day 8 of cycle 1, days 1 and 8 of&#xD;
      cycle 2, and day 1 of cycle 3. Treatments repeat every 2 weeks for up to 3 cycles in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo standard of&#xD;
      care surgical resection at week 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, then every 12 weeks&#xD;
      for up to 2 years.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Must not be breastfeeding&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must agree (WOCBP) to follow instructions for method(s) of contraception from the time&#xD;
             of enrollment for the duration of treatment with study drug (s) for a total of 12&#xD;
             months post treatment completion. Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must agree to&#xD;
             follow instructions for method(s) of contraception for the duration of treatment with&#xD;
             study drug(s) plus 5 half-lives of study drug (s) plus 90 days (duration of sperm&#xD;
             turnover) for a total of 7 months post-treatment completion&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  NOTE: Azoospermic males and WOCBP who are continuously not heterosexually active&#xD;
                  are exempt from contraceptive requirements. However, WOCBP must still undergo&#xD;
                  pregnancy testing as described in these sections. Investigators shall counsel&#xD;
                  WOCBP and male subjects who are sexually active with WOCBP on the importance of&#xD;
                  pregnancy prevention and the implications of an unexpected pregnancy&#xD;
                  Investigators shall advise WOCBP and male subjects who are sexually active with&#xD;
                  WOCBP on the use of highly effective methods of contraception. Highly effective&#xD;
                  methods of contraception have a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year when used&#xD;
                  consistently and correctly. At a minimum, subjects must agree to the use of two&#xD;
                  methods of contraception, with one method being highly effective and the other&#xD;
                  method being either highly effective or less effective as listed below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        HIGHLY EFFECTIVE METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male condoms with spermicide&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hormonal methods of contraception including combined oral contraceptive pills, vaginal&#xD;
             ring, injectables, implants, and intrauterine devices (IUDs) such as Mirena by WOCBP&#xD;
             subject or male subject's WOCBP partner.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Nonhormonal IUDs, such as ParaGard&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tubal ligation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Vasectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Complete Abstinence*&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Complete abstinence is defined as complete avoidance of heterosexual intercourse and&#xD;
             is an acceptable form of contraception for all study drugs. Abstinence is only&#xD;
             acceptable when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject.&#xD;
             Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, profession of abstinence&#xD;
             for entry into a clinical trial, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not&#xD;
             acceptable methods of contraception. Subjects who choose complete abstinence are not&#xD;
             required to use a second method of contraception, but female subjects must continue to&#xD;
             have pregnancy tests. Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception&#xD;
             must be discussed in the event that the subject chooses to forego complete abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        LESS EFFECTIVE METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diaphragm with spermicide&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cervical cap with spermicide&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Vaginal sponge&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male condom without spermicide*&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Progestin only pills by WOCBP subject or male subject's WOCBP partner&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female condom*&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A male and female condom must not be used together&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Must not have received prior anticancer therapy with ADI-PEG 20 or anti-PD1 for&#xD;
                  HCC. Must not be receiving any concomitant systemic therapy for HCC&#xD;
