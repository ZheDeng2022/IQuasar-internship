      Need for study&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are a few studies published on this topic from various parts of the globe and the&#xD;
      results are mixed. Hence further research is required in this area and none of the studies&#xD;
      have included samples from the Middle East.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some studies done in this area focus on biomechanical aspects of gait (Cherni, 2018) and our&#xD;
      study mainly focuses on functional aspects of gait and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies done on this area focus highly on gait components and very little is available on the&#xD;
      literature on improving balance. Since balance and stability are crucial for walking, it was&#xD;
      decided to exclusively assess balance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to a wide range of therapeutic benefits, it is paramount to evaluate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      different therapies provided to improve gait.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the proposed research is to investigate the effectiveness of robotic assisted gait&#xD;
      training using Lokomat device as an adjunct in improving gait, balance and quality of life in&#xD;
      children with cerebral palsy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Gait and balance have been a major issue faced by cerebral palsy children.&#xD;
      Cerebral Palsy is the most common condition affecting around 2-2.5 children of 1000 live&#xD;
      births (1 in every 400 children) over the last 20 years in the Western world (Levit, 2019).&#xD;
      Cerebral Palsy causes complex issues related to physical, psychological and social functions.&#xD;
      Active participation and the highest level of independence during daily living are primary&#xD;
      goals for cerebral palsy children (Aurich, 2015). One of the major problems that limits&#xD;
      activities of daily living is relate to gait and balance in cerebral palsy. From the past&#xD;
      one-decade, the popularity of robotic assisted gait training devices have been increasing.&#xD;
      There are a studies published on this topic from various parts of the globe and the results&#xD;
      are mixed. Recent publications have demonstrated robotic assisted gait training benefits&#xD;
      people with cerebral palsy, specifically in increasing walking speed and endurance (Carvalho,&#xD;
      2017). However, the efficacy of robotic assisted gait training in improving gait and balance&#xD;
      is not well researched. This study will be the first one in the United Arab Emirates studying&#xD;
      the local population and mainly focusing on functional aspects of gait, balance and quality&#xD;
      of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: The main aim is to investigate the effectiveness of robotic -assisted gait training as&#xD;
      an adjunct to traditional physiotherapy to improve gait, balance and quality of life in&#xD;
      children with cerebral palsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research hypothesis: Robotic -assisted gait training applied as adjunct to traditional&#xD;
      therapy could improve balance, walking and quality of life in children with cerebral palsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: The participants attending the outpatient clinic at Zayed Higher Organization&#xD;
      for People of Determination, Abu Dhabi will be invited to take part in the study. They will&#xD;
      be randomly allocated to two groups. This study proposes to have 50 participants with at&#xD;
      least 25 in each group. The participants will all have spastic form of cerebral palsy as&#xD;
      possible with the age of 4-18 years. All the participants will have to have be at Gross Motor&#xD;
      Function Classification Level (GMFCS) level I- IV. The robotic -assisted gait training&#xD;
      include 5 sessions per week, of 40 min long session during one-month period. The conventional&#xD;
      physiotherapy includes 5 sessions per week of 40 min long session during one-month period.&#xD;
      The primary analysis will be the pre to post-test differences of the Gross Motor Function&#xD;
      Measure (GMFM-88),dimension D &amp; E, 10 meters walk test, 6 minute walk test, Pediatric Balance&#xD;
      Scale, Cerebral palsy Quality of Life questionnaire between experimental and control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis: Data will be statistically analysed using one-way anova. Descriptive&#xD;
      statistics and graphic displays will be present for all outcomes for interventions comparing&#xD;
      robotic -assisted gait training with traditional physiotherapy training.&#xD;
