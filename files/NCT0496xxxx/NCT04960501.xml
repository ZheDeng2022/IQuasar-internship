      Research purposes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyze the curative effect of the new tension band system composed of φ3.0mm hollow nails,&#xD;
      titanium cables and new gaskets and the patellar tension reduction band in the treatment of&#xD;
      lower pole fractures of the patella.&#xD;
&#xD;
      research method: A retrospective study of 41 cases of comminuted fractures of the lower pole&#xD;
      of the patella treated with a new tension band system composed of φ3.0mm hollow nails,&#xD;
      titanium cables and new spacers from March 2012 to July 2017, including 19 males and 22&#xD;
      females , The average age is 56.7 years (22 to 79 years), 24 cases of AO/OTA A1 type, and 17&#xD;
      cases of C1.3 type. During the same period, 22 cases of comminuted fractures of the lower&#xD;
      pole of the patella were treated with a patella tension band, including 8 males and 14&#xD;
      females, with an average age of 57.4 years (32 to 84 years), 17 cases of AO/OTA type A1, and&#xD;
      5 cases of type C1.3. The injury mechanism is all slipping and kneeling injuries.&#xD;
