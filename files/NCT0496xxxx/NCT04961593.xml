  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Caspofungin is an anti-fungal drug mainly metabolized by the liver. The pathophysiological&#xD;
      status of children with severe infection will affect the metabolism of caspofungin in the&#xD;
      body especially in the case of liver dysfunction. There is little metabolism of caspofungin&#xD;
      through the kidney and continuous renal replacement therapy and renal function have little&#xD;
      influence on the pharmacokinetics of caspofungin. The study aim to investigate PK/PD of&#xD;
      caspofungin in children with specific pathophysiological conditions, such as liver&#xD;
      insufficiency, hypoproteinemia, ECMO treatment, or sepsis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current international recommended dose of caspofungin is 70 mg per square metre for load&#xD;
      for children who is older than three months of age, followed by 50 mg per square metre for&#xD;
      maintenance. For newborns and infants younger than 3 months of ageï¼Œ25 mg per square metre is&#xD;
      also recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whether such a recommended dose can achieve an ideal PK/PD target in children with liver&#xD;
      insufficiency, hypoproteinemia, ECMO treatment, or severe infection is still lacking in&#xD;
      sufficient clinical data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to investigate PK/PD of caspofungin in children with specific&#xD;
      pathophysiological conditions, such as liver insufficiency, hypoproteinemia, ECMO treatment,&#xD;
      or sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sampling time points of caspofungin are listed as follow:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before administration (0 min); 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 8 h , 12 h and 24 h after administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concentration of caspofungin in whole blood will be analyzed at Huashan Hospital of Fudan&#xD;
      University.&#xD;
