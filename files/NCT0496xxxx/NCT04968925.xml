          4. By self-report, habitually wear soft spherical contact lenses in both eyes in a daily&#xD;
             disposable wear modality. Habitual wear is defined as a minimum of 8 hours of wear per&#xD;
             day, for a minimum of 4 days per week during the past 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. By self-report, typically uses computer screens and other digital devices (phones,&#xD;
             tablets) at least 30 hours per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The vertex-corrected best spherical distance refraction (rounded to nearest 0.25 D)&#xD;
             must be between -1.00 and -4.00 DS (inclusive) in each eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. The magnitude of the cylinder component of the subject's distance refraction must be&#xD;
             1.00 DC or less.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. The subject must have best corrected visual acuity of 20/25 or better in each eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

             medication that might contraindicate or interfere with contact lens wear, or otherwise&#xD;
             compromise study endpoints, including infectious disease (e.g., hepatitis,&#xD;
             tuberculosis), contagious immunosuppressive disease (e.g., Human Immunodeficiency&#xD;
             Virus [HIV]), autoimmune disease (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, SjÃ¶gren's syndrome), or&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Habitually wear monovision, multifocal, toric, or extended wear contact lens&#xD;
             correction&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Have participated in any contact lens or lens care product clinical trial within 14&#xD;
             days prior to study enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Be an employee or immediate family member of an employee of clinical site (e.g.,&#xD;
             Investigator, Coordinator, Technician)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Have a history of amblyopia or strabismus.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Have habitually worn rigid gas permeable (RGP) lenses, orthokeratology lenses, or&#xD;
             hybrid lenses (eg, SynergEyes) within the past 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Have clinically significant (Grade 3 or higher on the FDA grading scale) slit lamp&#xD;
             findings (e.g., corneal edema, neovascularization or staining, tarsal abnormalities or&#xD;
             bulbar injection) or other corneal or ocular disease or abnormalities that&#xD;
             contraindicate contact lens wear or may otherwise compromise study endpoints&#xD;
             (including entropion, ectropion, chalazia, recurrent styes, glaucoma, history of&#xD;
             recurrent corneal erosions, aphakia, moderate or above corneal distortion, herpetic&#xD;
             keratitis).&#xD;
