  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants are being asked to take part in this clinical trial, a type of research study,&#xD;
      because the participants have a Wilms Tumor cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether delivery of proton beam radiation to a conformal reduced target volume&#xD;
      in the flank allows normal flank growth compared to the contralateral untreated side and&#xD;
      non-irradiated patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      To deliver proton beam radiation to a conformal reduced target volume (partial kidney proton&#xD;
      beam radiation therapy) in the affected kidney(s) for patients with Stage V (bilateral Wilms&#xD;
      tumor) and specific involved surgical margins yielding no reduction in the high control rates&#xD;
      seen with more traditional flank / whole kidney fields.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study the feasibility of sparing the residual kidney, spine and liver in patients&#xD;
           requiring whole abdomen radiation therapy using either a proton beam treatment technique&#xD;
           or intensity-modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT) photon based technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study the feasibility of delivering whole lung radiation therapy with proton beams with&#xD;
           the goals of sparing the developing breast tissue, heart structures, thyroid and liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Develop simultaneous xenografts and organoid models from the same starting material to&#xD;
           study Wilms tumor biology and compare responses to chemotherapeutic agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Define the evolution of organ specific (kidney, liver, pancreas, etc.) abnormalities&#xD;
           (laboratory studies) as an early marker of possible late end organ damage and their&#xD;
           relationship to radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study and evaluate impact of proton therapy on the musculoskeletal system and physical&#xD;
           performance and compare with photon therapy cases treated with classical treatment&#xD;
           fields.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess CTC-AE and Pediatric Patient Reported Outcomes during radiation and in follow-up,&#xD;
           correlating with disease, treatment and patient variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlate quantitative MRI values, including apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)&#xD;
           values, with histopathology findings post-surgery in children with (bilateral) Wilms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess daily variations in proton range along each treatment beam using standard&#xD;
           pre-treatment cone beam CT or on-treatment MR.&#xD;

      Participants will receive proton beam radiation therapy (PBRT) according to stage and&#xD;
      surgical findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Favorable Histology Stage I &amp; II and FH Stage III/IV Delayed Local Control with clear&#xD;
      surgical margins and pathologically negative lymph nodes: Participants will undergo complete&#xD;
      surgical resection at diagnosis or after 6-12 weeks of induction chemotherapy. PBRT will not&#xD;
      be administered to the primary site in those with no evidence of spill, peritoneal&#xD;
      involvement, lymph node (LN) involvement or microscopic residual in the abdomen. Systemic&#xD;
      therapy will be delivered in a standard of care manner according to histology and stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage III &amp; IV Adjuvant RT: Participants will undergo surgical resection at diagnosis or&#xD;
      after 6-12 weeks of induction chemotherapy. Those with evidence of LN involvement, surgical&#xD;
      margin involvement, local or diffuse spill, gross disease in the renal bed or peritoneal&#xD;
      implants, will receive adjuvant PBRT. Systemic therapy will be delivered in a standard of&#xD;
      care manner according to histology and stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage V Adjuvant RT: Participants will undergo partial nephrectomy after 6-12 weeks of&#xD;
      induction chemotherapy. Those with evidence of LN involvement, surgical margin involvement,&#xD;
      local or diffuse spill, gross disease in the renal bed or peritoneal implants, will receive&#xD;
      adjuvant PBRT. Systemic therapy will be delivered in a standard of care manner according to&#xD;
      histology and stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systemic therapy will follow a well-defined standard of care based on Children's Oncology&#xD;
      Group (COG) approaches including pre-operative chemotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy. The&#xD;
      intent will be to standardize chemotherapy to ensure a consistent background of standard of&#xD;
      care therapy, while not mandating additional data collection beyond the specific trial&#xD;
      objectives.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients are eligible to be enrolled on this trial at the time of initial (or&#xD;
             presumptive) diagnosis of Wilms tumor, at the time of surgery or at the time of&#xD;
             radiation treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients that are determined to be stage I or II will be eligible for the surgical and&#xD;
             biologic aspects of this trial but will otherwise be followed per institutional&#xD;
             standards and be &quot;off therapy&quot; at the time of stage determination (followed only for&#xD;
             survival).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients identified to have an anaplastic or other unfavorable tissue component&#xD;
             (non-Wilms histology) to their tumor may have tissue assessed for the biology&#xD;
             objective but will be removed from the therapeutic portion of the study at the time of&#xD;
             identification of this pathologic finding.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Performance Level • The Karnofsky performance status must be ≥50 for patients &gt;16 years of&#xD;
        age and the Lansky performance status must be ≥ 50 for patients ≤ 16 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Prior Therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Only prior therapy with the initial chemotherapy regimen defined in section 5.1 and&#xD;
             Appendix III are allowed for patients that are treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;
             These patients may change to an alternate regime based on response or biologic&#xD;
             features and noted in section 5.1. Prior biopsy or surgery is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior radiation therapy is not allowed if directed at the abdomen. Emergent RT to&#xD;
             other sites of disease is acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Organ Function Requirements:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  None - As per institutional standard of care. Diagnosis / Stage&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presumed diagnosis of Wilms tumor (continued management on trial will depend on stage&#xD;
             and histology)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Resected upfront stage III, IV or V favorable histology Wilms tumor. Stage III&#xD;
             includes any one or multiples of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Lymph nodes within the abdomen or pelvis are involved by tumor. (Lymph node&#xD;
                  involvement in the thorax, or other extra-abdominal sites is a criterion for&#xD;
                  Stage IV)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The tumor has penetrated through the peritoneal surface&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Tumor implants are found on the peritoneal surface&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Gross or microscopic tumor remains post-operatively (e.g., tumor cells are found&#xD;
                  at the margin of surgical resection on microscopic examination - in the post&#xD;
                  chemotherapy setting only specific types of viable tumor at the surgical margin&#xD;
                  are considered stage III AND require adjuvant radiation - see surgery / pathology&#xD;
                  / radiation section for additional details)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The tumor is not completely resectable because of local infiltration into vital&#xD;
                  structures&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Tumor spillage occurring either before or during surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A trans abdominal biopsy (regardless of type- tru-cut, open or fine needle&#xD;
                  aspiration) was performed prior to resection or chemotherapy. Retroperitoneal&#xD;
                  biopsies DO NOT require radiotherapeutic management like stage III&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Tumor is removed in greater than one piece (e.g. tumor cells are found in a&#xD;
                  separately excised adrenal gland; a tumor thrombus within the renal vein is&#xD;
                  removed separately from the nephrectomy specimen). Extension of the primary tumor&#xD;
                  within vena cava into thoracic vena cava and heart is considered Stage III,&#xD;
                  rather than Stage IV even though outside the abdomen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stage IV - Hematogenous metastases (lung, liver, bone, brain, etc.), or lymph node&#xD;
             metastases outside the abdomino-pelvic region are present. (The presence of tumor&#xD;
             within the adrenal gland is not interpreted as metastasis and staging depends on all&#xD;
             other staging parameters present). Patients with lung involvement and local abdominal&#xD;
             stage I or II are eligible to remain on trial for whole lung irradiation objective.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stage V - Bilateral renal involvement by tumor is present at diagnosis. An attempt&#xD;
             should be made to stage each side according to the above criteria on the basis of the&#xD;
             extent of disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients that have or will receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy for unresected unilateral&#xD;
             or bilateral Wilms tumor without a biopsy are not assumed to be require adjuvant&#xD;
             radiation on this study. That determination will be based on surgical findings and the&#xD;
             approach to treatment detailed in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Timing&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients undergoing upfront surgery must start RT, if indicated, within 28 days of&#xD;
             definitive surgery with a goal of starting RT by day 21.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy will be enrolled either at diagnosis (if&#xD;
             at St. Jude) or at the time of RT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Other Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        • Female patients of childbearing potential (age ≥10 years old or post-menarche) must have&#xD;
        a negative pregnancy test prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability or unwillingness to provide written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior radiation therapy to a site to be treated with proton / photon radiation as part&#xD;
             of this trial. Emergent radiation is allowed.&#xD;
