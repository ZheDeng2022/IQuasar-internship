  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pneumoconiosis is relatively prevalent in low/middle-income countries, and it remains a&#xD;
      challenging task to accurately and reliably diagnose pneumoconiosis. The investigators&#xD;
      implemented a deep learning solution and clarified the potential of deep learning in&#xD;
      pneumoconiosis diagnosis by comparing its performance with two certified radiologists. The&#xD;
      deep learning demonstrated a unique potential in classifying pneumoconiosis.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators retrospectively collected a dataset consisting of 1881 chest X-ray images&#xD;
      in the form of digital radiography. These images were acquired in a screening setting on&#xD;
      subjects who had a history of working in an environment that exposed them to harmful dust.&#xD;
      Among these subjects, 923 were diagnosed with pneumoconiosis, and 958 were normal. To&#xD;
      identify the subjects with pneumoconiosis, the investigators applied a classical deep&#xD;
      convolutional neural network (CNN) called Inception-V3 to these image sets and validated the&#xD;
      classification performance of the trained models using the area under the receiver operating&#xD;
      characteristic curve (AUC).&#xD;
