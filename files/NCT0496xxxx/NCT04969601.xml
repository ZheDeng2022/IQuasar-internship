  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mortality in case of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Covid-19) during acute leukemia (AL) treatment is&#xD;
      around 30%, i.e. more than 10 times the one of general population. Severe forms are reported&#xD;
      in children receiving chemotherapy for AL. However, the main risk, largely underestimated, is&#xD;
      related to delay in chemotherapy administration in case of infection, leading to an increased&#xD;
      risk of relapse. Therefore, it is justified to propose an anti-Covid-19 vaccination to these&#xD;
      patients. Vaccination of siblings also seems necessary given the uncertainty regarding&#xD;
      vaccine response in children with AL and given that household is the main source of&#xD;
      contamination. The messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccine COMIRNATY® (BNT162b2) is already&#xD;
      approved by health authorities for individuals older than 12. In immunocompromised children&#xD;
      with AL, safety and efficacy data are unknown. The benefit/risk balance encourages to use the&#xD;
      vaccine without health authority approval in children aged 1 to 15 with AL. Regarding&#xD;
      household, parents are vaccinated for several months as standard of care, but vaccination&#xD;
      will be proposed to siblings aged 12 to 15 years old in this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of COMIRNATY®&#xD;
      (BNT162b2) vaccine (two injections 21-28 days apart) in children with acute leukemia (1 to 15&#xD;
      years old) and their siblings (≥12-15 years old).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary objective of the study is to compare the quality of humoral and cellular vaccine&#xD;
      responses in children with AL and healthy children.&#xD;

Any other unexpected grade 3-4 clinical adverse event according to CTCAE v5.0 related to vaccination.&#xD;
A committee of critical events and DLTs surveillance will validate if declared grade 3-4 serious adverse events are related to vaccine.</description>
