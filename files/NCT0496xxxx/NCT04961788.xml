      To explore the objective response rate and safety of toripalimab combined with Gemox in the&#xD;
      first-line treatment of progressive, metastatic or unresectable advanced ICC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies have shown that the Gemox chemotherapy (oxaliplatin + gemcitabine) in patients with&#xD;
      advanced biliary tract cancer has an objective response rate (ORR) of 22% (95% CI 6.5-37.4%)&#xD;
      and a stable disease rate of 30%. The progression rate was 48%, the tumor progression-free&#xD;
      survival (PFS) was 3.9 months and the overall survival (OS) was 7.6 months. In recent years,&#xD;
      monoclonal antibodies against programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) and programmed cell death&#xD;
      ligand 1 (PD-L1) such as nivolumab, Pembrolizumab, and Toripalimab. It has shown encouraging&#xD;
      effects in the treatment of a variety of solid tumors. For advanced cholangiocarcinoma that&#xD;
      cannot be resected or is accompanied by metastasis, NCCN guidelines (NCCN guidelines&#xD;
      hepatobiliary cancer, 2020) recommend that the current treatment options are limited, and&#xD;
      gemcitabine combined with platinum anti-tumor drugs (cisplatin, oxaliplatin, etc.) are&#xD;
      recommended. Chemotherapy regimen as first-line treatment. For those with microsatellite&#xD;
      instability, it is recommended to add a PD1 monoclonal antibody. The guidelines also&#xD;
      specifically stated that the above recommendations lack evidence support from phase III&#xD;
      clinical trials and encourage the development of clinical trial research. PD1 monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody combined with chemotherapy in the treatment of advanced ICC may have a better effect&#xD;
      than chemotherapy alone. Currently, as a first-line treatment, there is no research report on&#xD;
      PD1 monoclonal antibody combined with Gemox in the treatment of advanced ICC.&#xD;
