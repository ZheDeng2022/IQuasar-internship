      The purpose of this study is to assess the rate and extent of absorption of macitentan&#xD;
      following administration of a single oral dose of macitentan formulated as final market image&#xD;
      (FMI) (test), compared to macitentan as the clinical service formulation (CSF) under fasted&#xD;
      conditions in healthy adult participants.&#xD;
