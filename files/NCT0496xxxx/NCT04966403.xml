    <textblock>
      To investigate the effect of a 3-month, trampoline-based stretch-shortening cycle (SSC)&#xD;
      exercises on muscle strength and postural control in children with Down syndrome.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      a variety of physical therapy techniques are being used to improve lower limb muscle strength&#xD;
      and postural control in children with Down syndrome including, but not limited to,&#xD;
      progressive resistance training, hippotherapy, aquatic therapy, and isokinetic strength&#xD;
      training. Stretch-shortening (SSC) exercises-also referred to as plyometric exercises, is a&#xD;
      traditional form of resistance training that involves three-phase muscle contraction during&#xD;
      dynamic movements (like jumping and hopping), where the muscle moves rapidly through the&#xD;
      eccentric, isometric, and concentric phases.&#xD;

    <description>Participants in the standard physical therapy received the standard physical therapy (sPT) program, which was conducted according to the needs of each participant and was generally concerned with building strength, enhancing developmental skills, boosting balance, coordination, and postural control, improving physical fitness, and minimizing the development of the compensatory movement patterns that children with DS are likely to develop.</description>

    <description>In addition to the sPT, the SSC group received 15-minute SSC exercise sessions, twice weekly, with a total of 24 sessions over 12 successive weeks.</description>
