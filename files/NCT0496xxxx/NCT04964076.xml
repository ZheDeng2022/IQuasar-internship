  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We aimed to collect clinical and radiological data of patients with stable COPD in plateau&#xD;
      and plain, and compare the clinical phenotypic characteristics and imaging features of COPD&#xD;
      patients in these two areas.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical phenotypic characteristics and&#xD;
      imaging features of patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in&#xD;
      plateau and plain. We conducted a cross-sectional study, collecting clinical data of stable&#xD;
      patients in plateau and plain, and comparing the clinical phenotypic characteristics and&#xD;
      imaging features of COPD patients in these two areas.&#xD;
