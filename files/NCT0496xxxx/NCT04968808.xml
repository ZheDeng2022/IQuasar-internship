    <textblock>
      Many patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) have multivessel&#xD;
      coronary artery disease (MVD), which is associated with poor clinical outcomes. However,&#xD;
      there have been few studies regarding revascularization strategy in patients with NSTEMI and&#xD;
      MVD. Therefore, we planned to perform prospective, open-label, randomized trial to evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of immediate complete revascularization (percutaneous coronary&#xD;
      intervention [PCI] for both infarct-related artery [IRA] and non-IRA during index PCI)&#xD;
      compared to staged PCI strategy of non-IRA (PCI for IRA followed by non-IRA PCI after several&#xD;
      days). PCI procedure at non-IRA with diameter stenosis between 50 and 69% should be conducted&#xD;
      with the aid of fractional flow reserve (FFR), and non-IRA with diameter stenosis ≥ 70% will&#xD;
      be revascularized without FFR.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Many patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) have multivessel&#xD;
      coronary artery disease (MVD), which is associated with poor clinical outcomes. In cases of&#xD;
      hemodynamically stable ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and MVD, many&#xD;
      studies demonstrated the superiority of complete revascularization (CR) by both one-stage and&#xD;
      multistage procedures compared to culprit-only revascularization (COR). The 2017 European&#xD;
      Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines for STEMI recommend routine revascularization for non&#xD;
      infarct-related artery (IRA) lesions before hospital discharge in patients without&#xD;
      cardiogenic shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there have been few studies regarding revascularization strategy in patients with&#xD;
      NSTEMI and MVD. Only one randomized controlled trial, the SMILE trial (J Am Coll Cardiol&#xD;
      2016;67:264-72), compared one-stage and multi-stage multivessel revascularization (MVR) in&#xD;
      these patients. Although the results of most studies analyzing interventional strategies in&#xD;
      patients with NSTEMI and MVD showed superior results of MVR compared to COR, they did not&#xD;
      provide information about staged revascularization. One-stage MVR was associated with better&#xD;
      clinical outcomes compared to multi-stage MVR in the SMILE trial, while one-stage and&#xD;
      multi-stage MVR had similar incidences of adverse outcomes in large registry data. Although&#xD;
      the 2018 ESC/European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (EACTS) guidelines for&#xD;
      myocardial revascularization recommend complete one-stage revascularization in NSTEMI and&#xD;
      MVD, it emphasizes individualization based on clinical status and comorbidities, as well as&#xD;
      disease severity. In 2020 ESC guidelines for non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary&#xD;
      syndrome, this strategy is maintained. CR during index percutaneous coronary intervention&#xD;
      (PCI) is recommended in NSTEMI patients with MVD (class IIb, level B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whether to revascularize non-IRA using angiography or fractional flow reserve (FFR) is also&#xD;
      problematic. FFR is a useful tool for assessing hemodynamic significance of non-IRA during&#xD;
      both acute and subacute stage, and FFR-guided PCI for non-IRA lesion is recommended during&#xD;
      index PCI (class IIb, level B). In the SMILE trial, a 25.8% of study patients received&#xD;
      FFR-guided PCI for non-IRA. Although FFR is a well-known tool to evaluate significant&#xD;
      ischemia of moderate stenosis, the most studies regarding FFR enrolled patients without acute&#xD;
      myocardial infarction (AMI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the recommendations in current guidelines, which recommends CR during index PCI, is&#xD;
      not sufficiently powered to assess differences in clinical outcomes between interventional&#xD;
      strategy. There are also few studies regarding this issue, and discrepancy in clinical&#xD;
      outcomes between randomized trial and observational studies. Furthermore, FFR-guided PCI for&#xD;
      non-IRA is not mandatory in these studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, we planned to perform prospective, open-label, randomized trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of immediate complete revascularization (PCI for both IRA and non-IRA&#xD;
      during index PCI) compared to staged PCI strategy of non-IRA (PCI for IRA followed by non-IRA&#xD;
      PCI after several days). PCI procedure at non-IRA with diameter stenosis between 50 and 69%&#xD;
      should be conducted with the aid of FFR, and non-IRA with diameter stenosis ≥ 70% will be&#xD;
      revascularized without FFR.&#xD;
