             months before enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who previously received 2 injections of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine with the&#xD;
             second dose received at least 5 months before Visit 1&#xD;

             participants with Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent vaccine at the end of the study will&#xD;
             not be considered by the Sponsor as meeting this exclusion criterion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of blood-derived immune globulins, blood, or blood-derived products in the&#xD;
             past 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation at the time of study enrollment (or in the 30 days preceding the first&#xD;
             study vaccination) or planned participation during the present study period in another&#xD;
             clinical study investigating vaccine, drug, medical device, or medical procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Deprived of freedom by an administrative or court order, or in an emergency setting,&#xD;
