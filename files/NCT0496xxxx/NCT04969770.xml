  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuromuscular scoliosis are caused by a disorder of the brain, spinal cord or muscular system&#xD;
      and often progressive at early age. Conservative treatment is not sufficient to maintain&#xD;
      trunk and pelvic balance, and surgical treatment is frequently required. Early definitive&#xD;
      spine fusion has the disadvantage of cessation of trunk growth with concomitant effects on&#xD;
      lung development. Growth preserving spine surgeries are increasingly used but with high&#xD;
      complication rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The orthopaedic team at Necker Hospital Enfants maladies, Paris, France has developed an&#xD;
      innovative fusionless surgery based on a bipolar spine construct, performed by a minimally&#xD;
      invasive approach. The first 100 patients operated on with this technique had an average&#xD;
      follow-up of 6.5 years. No arthrodesis, initially planned in adolescence, was necessary&#xD;
      thanks to the stability of the correction of the deformities even after skeletal maturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study was to analyze the progressive spinal stiffening, using&#xD;
      muscle and disc elastography, in neuromuscular patients instrumented with this bipolar&#xD;
      construct.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuromuscular scoliosis is related to muscle tone abnormalities with a prognosis worsen by&#xD;
      damage to the axial and respiratory muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The classic treatment for these scoliosis consists of conservative treatment (physiotherapy,&#xD;
      bracing), followed by arthrodesis in adolescence. Arthrodesis consists of a global posterior&#xD;
      spinal fusion, with a high risk of septic and hemorrhagic complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In cases of early and rapidly progressive deformities, fusionless techniques allow the&#xD;
      preservation of growth while waiting for arthrodesis. However, these techniques have a high&#xD;
      rate of complications, particularly of mechanical and infectious origin, which led the&#xD;
      orthopedic team at Necker Hospital, Paris, France to develop an innovative technique. This&#xD;
      technique is based on bipolar construct, performed by a minimally invasive approach. The&#xD;
      first 100 patients operated on have an average follow-up of 6.5 years. No arthrodesis,&#xD;
      initially planned in adolescence for these patients, was necessary, thanks to the stability&#xD;
      of the correction even after skeletal maturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study was to analyze the progressive spinal stiffening, using&#xD;
      muscle and disc elastography, in neuromuscular patients instrumented with this bipolar&#xD;
      construct.&#xD;
