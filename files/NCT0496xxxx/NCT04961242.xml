  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot evaluation of a set of free digital mental health resources developed for&#xD;
      COVID-19 relief in California, with funding for the evaluation by the California Health Care&#xD;
      Foundation. The website includes resources to support information on COVID-19, meditation and&#xD;
      stress management, resources for parenting resilience, resources for social connection and&#xD;
      addressing structural racism, and linkages to resources under the partnering &quot;CalHOPE&quot;&#xD;
      website (FEMA funded). The evaluation includes: 1) an invitation from a partnering agency to&#xD;
      visit the website and consider the evaluation; 2) a post website visit baseline survey; 3) a&#xD;
      follow-up survey 4-6 weeks later; 4) a telephone interview for a subset of participants who&#xD;
      agree to the follow-up interview and provide their contact information.&#xD;

      Relevance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The COVID-19 pandemic has raised awareness of mental health as a primary public health&#xD;
      concern. Physical distancing, business and school closures, grief, and stress are aspects of&#xD;
      the pandemic with significant mental health consequences. The pandemic has also&#xD;
      disproportionately impacted Black, Asian and Pacific Islander, Indigenous, and Latino&#xD;
      populations. Concurrent with the pandemic has been a surge in attention on police violence&#xD;
      toward Black Americans as well as systemic racism against other groups (Asian) and in other&#xD;
      institutions. These stressors are also likely to have substantial mental health consequences.&#xD;
      To support addressing these concerns, the state requested development of a website (Together&#xD;
      for Wellness) with input from stakeholders across the state, to support dealing with&#xD;
      informational needs and stress of diverse stakeholders across the state. In addition, a goal&#xD;
      was to obtain user feedback data to understand impact of the website Below are aims for the&#xD;
      initial survey, qualitative interview for a subsample, and follow-up survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims for Initial Survey:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To understand the subjective value of a website of free mental health&#xD;
      resources for users of various ethnicities, ages, and who may differ in baseline mental&#xD;
      health status and use of mental health services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To understand the subjective value of a website of free mental health&#xD;
      resources for users with various degrees of COVID-related stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims for Qualitative Interviews:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The broad goal is to use qualitative interviews to more deeply understand the experiences of&#xD;
      participants in reviewing the website, their needs for support for themselves, family or&#xD;
      community, and ideas for further development of the website. The qualitative interview data&#xD;
      will also be linked to their survey data and google analytics data, and de-identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: To understand the experiences of users who reviewed the website of free&#xD;
      mental health resources, using a semi-structured interview guide to examine responses to the&#xD;
      website, their needs for support for themselves, family or community, and ideas for improving&#xD;
      the website.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 4: To understand how subjective experiences may vary across website users, and&#xD;
      to gain insight from participants from various strata (e.g., various race/ethnicity groups,&#xD;
      those who live in urban and rural locations, those with various levels of COVID-related&#xD;
      stress, and people of different age groups and different gender identities, or other&#xD;
      demographics). With stakeholder input, we will select priorities for stratification of&#xD;
      sampling (and may increase the number of interviews conducted based on resources available to&#xD;
      partnering stakeholder groups through existing contracts that some agencies have with the&#xD;
      Mental Health Services Oversight and Accountability Commission).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims for Follow-up Survey:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the follow-up survey, to be conducted 4-6 weeks after patients have completed&#xD;
      their initial website review and their initial survey, is to explore impacts in terms of use&#xD;
      of services, and effects on mental health stigma and brief measures of stress/anxiety, and&#xD;
      provide follow-up information on mediating factors such as experience of stress including&#xD;
      with the COVID-19 pandemic. The follow-up survey will provide evaluative data on somewhat&#xD;
      longer-term impact than the immediate quantitative survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 5: To understand the experience of users who reviewed the website of free mental&#xD;
      health resources, 4-6 weeks after their initial survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 6: To understand any associations of experience of the website with mental&#xD;
      health stigma items, and use of services; as well as any continued use of the website&#xD;
      resources; and explore changes in risk for depression and anxiety (PHQ2 and GAD2) and context&#xD;
      for stresses due to the COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Linkage to Survey and Google Analytics Data for follow-up survey Survey data will also be&#xD;
      linked to respondents' initial survey and google analytics data, to understand the context of&#xD;
      website use and user characteristics for the sample.&#xD;
