      This study (FLOWER) will investigate effectiveness, safety, progression patterns and clinical&#xD;
      management of untreated advanced NSCLC patients receiving fist-line osimertinib in the&#xD;
      real-world.&#xD;

      FLOWER is a real-world, prospective, observational study enrolling patients with histological&#xD;
      and/or cytological diagnosis of EGFR-mutant aNSCLC, receiving first-line treatment with the&#xD;
      third-generation EGFR-TKI, osimertinib. All the patients received osimertinib at the&#xD;
      recommended dose of 80 mg, orally, once a day. Dosing interruptions or reductions required,&#xD;
      based on individual tolerability, were managed according to clinical practice in compliance&#xD;
      with label indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FLOWER study aims at evaluating effectiveness, safety, progression pattern and clinical&#xD;
      management of untreated EGFR-mutant aNSCLC patients in the real-world.&#xD;
