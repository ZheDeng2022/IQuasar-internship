  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will assess the feasibility of monthly post rehabilitation remote monitoring, using&#xD;
      the &quot;MAX Educ&quot; webvision app, in patients with sequelae of aerodigestive cancer treatments.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patients included in the study will benefit from a monthly video follow-up via the WEB&#xD;
      tool &quot;MAX Educ&quot; during the first 6 months of their discharge from the rehabilitation center.&#xD;
      They will be contacted each month during 5 months by the CRIL speech therapist for an&#xD;
      interview (20 to 30 minutes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interview will take place in 2 stages; at first, a discussion phase, during which the&#xD;
      speech therapist will take simple news of the patient. The second phase, more formal, will be&#xD;
      the opportunity to collect the data necessary for the validation of the secondary endpoints.&#xD;
      To do this, the speech therapist will use the Deglutition Handicap Index (DHI) and an&#xD;
      interview grid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interview will be conducted using an interview sheet previously written by the project&#xD;
      team. The following elements will be discussed: the perceived swallowing handicap (DHI), the&#xD;
      instructions related to diet and their daily application, ongoing rehabilitation follow-ups,&#xD;
      notable events as well as his psycho-emotional experience in relation to said disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After signing the consent and verifying the eligibility criteria, all patients will be&#xD;
      assessed upon discharge from the rehabilitation center by means of video swallowing&#xD;
      fluoroscopy, allowing the deglutition score to be established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire QLQ-30 and its annex H &amp; N35 and the DHI will also be&#xD;
      completed at the inclusion visit at T0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will then be monitored monthly by video from Month 1 to Month 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the end of research visit at 6 months, all the patients included will be reviewed in&#xD;
      follow-up consultation with a doctor and a speech therapist within the intensive&#xD;
      rehabilitation center for laryngectomees (which corresponds to the standard follow-up) and&#xD;
      evaluated by video swallowing fluoroscopy. EORTC QLQ-30, EORTC QLQ-H &amp; N35 quality of life&#xD;
      questionnaires and the DHI will also have to be completed.&#xD;

    <description>The feeling of swallowing will be assessed at the end of the stay at the rehabilitation center, which corresponds to the first visit, and then every month for 5 months during remote interviews and on discharge with the Deglutition Handicap Index (DHI), a self-assessment questionnaire for the swallowing handicap.&#xD;
The quality of life will be assessed at the firs visit and 6 months after using the EORTC QLQ 30 quality of life scale and the H&amp;N annex, a self-assessment questionnaire on the quality of life for people with cancer of the head and neck.&#xD;
The satisfaction of users and the interest of city health professionals in the use of the &quot;MAX Educ&quot; tool as part of a monthly monitoring will be collected via the TUQ questionnaire, through the MAX platform at Month 6.</description>
