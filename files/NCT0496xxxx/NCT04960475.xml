    <textblock>
      This study intends to investigate the negative emotions, fear-avoidance beliefs, and quality&#xD;
      of life in patients with chronic ankle sprains to explore the relationship between negative&#xD;
      emotions such as anxiety and depression, fear-avoidance beliefs, and their impact on quality&#xD;
      of life.&#xD;

      Research design: This study is an observational study. It is planned to recruit a total of&#xD;
      120 patients with ankle sprain injury who meet the selection criteria from the Rehabilitation&#xD;
      Department of Peking University Third Hospital. They will be divided into an anxiety and&#xD;
      depression group and a control group based on anxiety and depression scale. Basic&#xD;
      information, anxiety and depression scales, fear-avoidance beliefs score and quality of life&#xD;
      score of two groups will be compared and analyzed.&#xD;

    <description>The assessment content in the scale is divided into two parts: anxiety and depression. Anxiety is an unexplained state of restlessness, manifested as tension, fear, and panic all day long. Depression is manifested as depression, slow thinking, decreased volition and physical symptoms. The two parts are scored separately. A total score of 0-7 means normal, a total score of 8-10 means mild depression/anxiety, a total score of 11-14 means moderate depression/anxiety, and a total score of 15-21 means severe depression/ anxiety.</description>

    <description>FABQ is a self-assessment questionnaire with 16 options. Each option has 7 levels of 0-6 points, representing totally disagree, uncertain, and totally agree; there are 2 subscales, and one subscale measures the fear-avoidance in physical activity, another subscale measures fear-avoidance of work. The final score of FABQ is the superposition of the value of each item. A high score indicates a high level of fear-avoidance beliefs.</description>

        Ankle sprains are the most common injury in everyday life, military training and sports.&#xD;
        Forty percent of people with ankle sprains develop chronic ankle instability, including&#xD;
        mechanical ankle instability and functional ankle instability. Mechanical ankle instability&#xD;
        is usually caused by structural changes in the ligamentous tissue around the ankle,&#xD;
        kinematic damage, synovial changes or degenerative joint disease. Functional ankle&#xD;
        instability refers to the subjective perception of instability during daily life or sports.&#xD;
        Most patients do not require surgery, and clinical examination reveals only minor swelling&#xD;
        and localized pressure pain, but rarely severe structural damage to the joint with limited&#xD;
        range of motion and joint instability. However, many patients with chronic functional&#xD;
        instability of the ankle joint due to ankle sprain are unable to resume normal work and&#xD;
        life due to emotional anxiety and repeatedly seek medical attention.&#xD;
