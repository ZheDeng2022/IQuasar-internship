  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) remains a salient and debilitating problem, in the&#xD;
      general population and for military veterans in particular. Several psychological and&#xD;
      pharmacological treatments for PTSD have evidence to support their efficacy. However, the&#xD;
      lack of comparative effectiveness data for PTSD treatments remains a major gap in the&#xD;
      literature, which limits conclusions that can be drawn about which of these treatments work&#xD;
      best. The current study will compare the effectiveness of PTSD treatments with the strongest&#xD;
      evidentiary support - Prolonged Exposure (PE) therapy and pharmacotherapy with paroxetine or&#xD;
      venlafaxine - as well as the combination of these two treatments. A randomized trial will be&#xD;
      conducted with a large, diverse sample of veterans with PTSD (N = 450) recruited from 6 VA&#xD;
      Medical Centers throughout the US. Participants will complete baseline assessments, followed&#xD;
      by an active treatment phase (involving up to 14 sessions of PE and/or medication management)&#xD;
      with mid (7 week) and posttreatment (14 week) assessments, and follow-up assessments at 27&#xD;
      and 40 weeks. Study outcomes will include PTSD severity, depression, quality of life and&#xD;
      functioning, assessed via clinical ratings and self-report measures. Further, a range of&#xD;
      demographic and clinically relevant variables (e.g., trauma type/number, resilience) will be&#xD;
      collected at baseline and examined as potential predictors or moderators of treatment&#xD;
      response, addressing another gap in the PTSD treatment literature. These data will be used to&#xD;
      develop algorithms from predicting the optimal treatment for individual patients (i.e.,&#xD;
      &quot;personalized advantage indices&quot;; PAIs). Effectiveness of the treatments will be compared&#xD;
      using multilevel modeling. PAIs will be developed by conducting bootstrapped analyses to&#xD;
      select variables that predict or moderate outcomes (clinician rated PTSD severity at Week&#xD;
      14), followed by jacknife analyses to determine the magnitude of the predicted difference&#xD;
      (representing an individual's &quot;predicted advantage&quot; of one treatment over the others).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) remains a salient and debilitating problem, in the&#xD;
      general population and for military veterans in particular. Several psychological and&#xD;
      pharmacological treatments for PTSD have evidence to support their efficacy. However, the&#xD;
      lack of comparative effectiveness trials for PTSD treatments remains a major gap in the&#xD;
      literature, which limits conclusions that can be drawn about which of these treatments work&#xD;
      best. In particular, trials directly comparing efficacious psychotherapies and&#xD;
      pharmacotherapies are needed to inform clinical decision making for patients and providers.&#xD;
      To address this gap, the proposed study will aim to compare the effectiveness of PTSD&#xD;
      treatments with the strongest evidentiary support - Prolonged Exposure (PE) therapy and&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy with paroxetine or venlafaxine - as well as the combination of these two&#xD;
      treatments. A randomized trial in proposed with a large, diverse sample of veterans with PTSD&#xD;
      (N = 450) recruited from 6 Veterans Affairs Medical Centers throughout the US (in&#xD;
      Philadelphia, Coatesville, Milwaukee, Dallas, San Diego, and Palo Alto). Treatments&#xD;
      conditions will reflect &quot;real world&quot; practice in these settings, and minimal exclusion&#xD;
      criteria related to safety will be adopted, to maximize external validity. Participants will&#xD;
      be permitted to complete treatment sessions in person or via telehealth (based on evidence&#xD;
      for equivalent outcomes across these modalities), to maximize patient access, recruitment,&#xD;
      and generalizability. Participants will complete baseline assessments, followed by 14 weeks&#xD;
      of active treatment (involving up to 14 sessions of PE and/or medication management) with mid&#xD;
      and posttreatment assessments after 7 and 14 weeks respectively, and then follow-up&#xD;
      assessments at 27 and 40 weeks. Primary outcomes will include PTSD severity, depression&#xD;
      symptoms, quality of life and functioning, assessed via clinical ratings and self-report&#xD;
      measures. Further, a range of demographic and clinically relevant variables (e.g., trauma&#xD;
      type/number, physiological arousal) will be collected at baseline and examined as potential&#xD;
      predictors or moderators of treatment response, addressing another key gap in the PTSD&#xD;
      treatment literature. Specifically, these data will be used to develop algorithms from&#xD;
      predicting the optimal treatment for individual patients (i.e., &quot;personalized advantage&#xD;
      indices&quot;; PAIs), a statistical approach which has advanced the depression treatment&#xD;
      literature but has only been used in a limited capacity in PTSD research. The project will&#xD;
      include an Advisory Board composed of clinician and patient representatives, in order to&#xD;
      obtain stakeholder feedback at every stage of the study (from implementation to dissemination&#xD;
      of findings). The effectiveness of the treatments will be compared using multilevel modeling.&#xD;
      PAIs will be developed by conducting bootstrapped analyses to select variables that predict&#xD;
      or moderate outcomes (Clinician Administered PTSD Scale severity ratings at Week 14),&#xD;
      followed by leave-one-out cross-validation (i.e., jackknife) analyses to determine the&#xD;
      magnitude of the predicted difference that results in each analysis representing that&#xD;
      individuals &quot;predicted advantage&quot; (of one treatment over the others). We hypothesize that&#xD;
      individuals who receive PE will have better outcomes than those who receive pharmacotherapy&#xD;
      alone, based on existing data (e.g., cross study effect size comparisons), but have planned&#xD;
      the study and sample to maximize statistical power in all analyses.&#xD;
