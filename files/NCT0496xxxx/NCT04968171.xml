    <textblock>
      The Diab1Fit Study project aims to a multidirectional assessment of physical activity and its&#xD;
      impact in people with type 1 diabetes (DM1). To the study are recruited people with newly&#xD;
      diagnosed DM1, treated with intensive functional insulin therapy from the beginning of the&#xD;
      disease. The study is planned to cover a minimum of 100 people with newly diagnosed DM1 and&#xD;
      lead prospective observation of this group (for a minimum of 5-10 years). The investigators&#xD;
      will evaluate the effect of VO2max in people with newly diagnosed DM1 on partial clinical&#xD;
      remission. What is more the investigators also assess quantitative and qualitative changes of&#xD;
      plasma lipoproteins, with particular emphasis on HDL metabolism, mechanism linking VO2max&#xD;
      with management of DM1 (longevity proteins, miostatin, insulin resistance) and immune&#xD;
      function.&#xD;

      plasma lipoproteins, with particular emphasis on HDL metabolism, mechanism linking VO2max&#xD;
      with management of DM1 (longevity proteins, miostatin, insulin resistance) and immune&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assessed: during the first hospitalization in the moment of diagnosis (prior&#xD;
      to introduction of insulin treatment), after 3 weeks, after 6 months and after 12 months of&#xD;
      insulin therapy. Further observations planned in the annual intervals. Further continuous&#xD;
      observation with follow-up every year and evaluation of final end-points after 5 and 10&#xD;
      years. In addition, the study group will be under constant monitoring of metabolic evaluation&#xD;
      every three months in the Outpatient Clinic. An additional visit to assess VO2max will be&#xD;
      scheduled between 3 and 12 months of diabetes. The investigators will use an ergospirometer&#xD;
      (COSMED K5 System) during an exercise test carried out on a cycloergometer (progressive&#xD;
      exercise test). Moreover, the investigators will monitor glucose levels during the exercise&#xD;
      test - using a continuous glucose monitoring system using the FreeStyle Libre Flash Glucose&#xD;
      Monitoring System (Abbott). A week before the exercise test, the investigators will borrow a&#xD;
      Garmin watch that assesses the patient's daily activities&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each follow-up will be assessed parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The presence of partial clinical remission, according to Mortensen: HbA1c (%) + [4 x&#xD;
           dawka insuliny (j/kg/d)] ≤ 9.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Data on lifestyle (diet, exercise), family history and smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Anthropometric data:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. BMI (body mass index) = weight [kg]/(height [m])2&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Waist circumference&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. WHR - waist to hip ratio&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. daily insulin requirement (U/kg m.c./d),&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. eGDR (estimated glucose disposal rate) = 24.31-12.22(WHR)-3.29(hypertension&#xD;
                0/1)-0.57( HbA1c [mg/kg/min])&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. VAI (visceral adiposity index):&#xD;
&#xD;
                For women = [Waist circumference/36.58+(1.89xBMI)]x(TG/0.81)x(1.52/HDL), For men =&#xD;
                [Waist circumference /39.68+(1.88xBMI)]x(TG/1.03)x(1.31/HDL),&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. body composition analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Parameters of diabetes metabolic control&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Lipid profile&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Glycated hemoglobin level (HbA1c)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Protein glycation end products Expected impact of the research project on the&#xD;
           development of science, civilization and society: The study confirms the great&#xD;
           importance of aerobic physical activity in the treatment of people with DM1 from the&#xD;
           beginning of the diagnosis. The project aims to pay attention to the importance of&#xD;
           physical activity among people with DM1 and to popularize this method of treatment. The&#xD;
           obtained results will be used for the prospective observation of this group to assess&#xD;
           the impact of physical effort on the development of chronic complications and will allow&#xD;
           planning intervention studies in this population. The results of this study will help&#xD;
           enrich knowledge about the body's ability to exercise among people with DM1 and show new&#xD;
           intervention solutions. It may contribute to changing the recommendations of scientific&#xD;
           societies. What is more knowledge about prolonging partial clinical remission and&#xD;
           thereby reducing the risk of developing chronic complications will contribute to the&#xD;
           introduction of new recommendations. Research on exercise in diabetes and longevity&#xD;
           proteins will increase the length and quality of life of people with DM1.&#xD;
