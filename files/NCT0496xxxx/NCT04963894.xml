    <textblock>
      Balance rehabilitation programs in people with Parkinson's disease (PD) that include&#xD;
      functional exercises, i.e. using tasks of daily living in training, show improvements in&#xD;
      variables related to balance and gait. In previous studies, the advantage of taking into&#xD;
      account the specificity of the task and the inclusion of specific objectives for the motor&#xD;
      rehabilitation of people with PD has been observed. The interventions with the best results&#xD;
      are usually carried out in hospital centers or rehabilitation gyms and, in groups of people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the situation experienced since last March 2020, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, group&#xD;
      rehabilitation programs have been affected, especially in those pathologies that involve&#xD;
      older age groups such as PD. For this reason, the need to transfer therapies to the home is&#xD;
      considered, as well as to make people aware of the importance of continued rehabilitation,&#xD;
      even from other settings. In the present study, we propose a rehabilitation program at home&#xD;
      for people with Parkinson's disease based on balance with functional exercises, which will be&#xD;
      compared with a home control group of people with PD that stay at home without any physical&#xD;
      rehabilitation, and a conventional group physiotherapy program carried out in a&#xD;
      rehabilitation gym in groups of 6 people. The effects of the experimental intervention and&#xD;
      the control groups will be evaluated on outcomes related to balance using a dynamometric&#xD;
      platform and outcomes related to gait through 3D photogrammetry.&#xD;

      I. Objectives and Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      General objective: To determine if the effects of home rehabilitation of functional balance&#xD;
      on the biomechanics of balance and gait, quality of life, cognitive status, and general&#xD;
      physical performance are greater than the effects observed from the daily life activities at&#xD;
      home, and from a conventional face-to-face group physiotherapy program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To analyze the intra- and inter-rater reliability of the balance assessment in people&#xD;
           with PD with dynamometric platforms performing functional tasks of daily life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the balance performance of people with PD in functional tasks before starting&#xD;
           a physical therapy program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Compare the immediate effects observed of the functional exercise-based rehabilitation&#xD;
           program with the evaluated effects of a group rehabilitation program and with control&#xD;
           participants staying at home without physical therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Compare the observed medium-term effects (8-weeks) of the functional balance&#xD;
           rehabilitation program with the observed medium-term effects of the conventional group&#xD;
           physiotherapy program and with control participants who remain at home without a&#xD;
           physiotherapy program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Analyze the influence of the severity of the disease, using the Hoehn and Yahr scale and&#xD;
           the Unified scale of Parkinson's disease, on the effects of the home rehabilitation&#xD;
           program based on functional exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. General procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, the approval of the Human Ethics Committee of the University of Valencia has been&#xD;
      obtained. After managing the agreement with the Parkinson Valencia Association, the&#xD;
      recruitment of participants will be carried out and, to those interested, an information&#xD;
      sheet will be given with all the details of the study. Once the intention to participate has&#xD;
      been confirmed, a first evaluation of the volunteers will be carried out to verify compliance&#xD;
      with the proposed selection criteria. In this evaluation, the documents of informed consent&#xD;
      and authorization for the use of images in scientific publications will be signed if&#xD;
      required; In addition, at this time a code will be assigned to each participant to ensure&#xD;
      their anonymity during the investigation to the evaluating staff and those in charge of&#xD;
      randomization and data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People were recruited who, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic had transferred home or&#xD;
      telematically all their therapies related to Parkinson's disease, and on the other hand, were&#xD;
      also recruited people who continued with therapies face-to-face. From the home volunteer&#xD;
      participants, they will be divided by a sequence of random numbers provided by the IBM SPSS&#xD;
      Statistics v.23 program into two groups: experimental group and home control group.&#xD;
      Additionally, the volunteers who maintained their therapies outside the home made up the&#xD;
      conventional control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluator will not know the assignment of the participants. After randomization, it will&#xD;
      be verified that the groups (experimental, home control, and conventional control group) do&#xD;
      not differ significantly in their sociodemographic characteristics, and severity of the&#xD;
      disease. The physiotherapist who will carry out the evaluations of the outcomes before and&#xD;
      after the intervention period will be a different person from the professional who will&#xD;
      evaluate the participation criteria. On the other hand, the intervention programs&#xD;
      (experimental and conventional) will be carried out by two different physiotherapists. Both&#xD;
      the assessment and the physiotherapy sessions do not contain invasive procedures and only&#xD;
      require participants to perform therapeutic exercises adapted to the physical condition of&#xD;
      people with PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pre-intervention (T0), post-intervention (T1), and follow-up evaluations at 8 weeks (T2)&#xD;
      will be carried out at the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Valencia, with the tools&#xD;
      provided by the research group to which the main researcher of the project belongs. The&#xD;
      interventions of the experimental group will take place at the home of each participant. The&#xD;
      group control group sessions will be held at the Parkinson Valencia Association facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      III.1. Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study consists of a single-blind, randomized clinical trial with crossover. The&#xD;
      study protocol has been developed according to the SPIRIT 2013 statement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will participate in a baseline assessment session (T0) before rehabilitative&#xD;
      treatment, followed by random allocation to the Experimental group (8 weeks of functional&#xD;
      balance physiotherapy) or the Home control group (daily functional activity). After these 8&#xD;
      weeks, all the participants will develop a second assessment session (T1) and rest for the&#xD;
      next 8 weeks to later carry out the follow-up assessment session (T2). At this time, patients&#xD;
      from the Home control group will be switch to the Experimental group, and participants from&#xD;
      the Experimental group will follow a 4-month period of inactivity wash-out. After this, they&#xD;
      will carry out the T0, T1, and T2 evaluations following the Home control group protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, a third group of participants with Parkinson's disease who regularly receive&#xD;
      conventional physiotherapy were evaluated (Conventional control group). The evaluation&#xD;
      sessions will be before starting the usual rehabilitation program after the 2-months summer&#xD;
      break (T0), after 8-weeks of rehabilitation (T1), and after 8-weeks of follow-up (T2). This&#xD;
      group of participants will carry out the physiotherapy in the usual format, that is, in a&#xD;
      rehabilitation gym and in groups of 6 people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III.2 Participants&#xD;

&#xD;
        1. Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale motor (UPDRS-motor): score obtained from the&#xD;
           motor section (III) of the UPDRS scale, which assesses the characteristic signs of the&#xD;
           disease. Low scores indicate better motor function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Mini Mental Parkinson test (MMP): score obtained on 32 points of the MMP cognitive&#xD;
           screening. A high score corresponds to a better test result.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB): score achieved in the FAB executive functions&#xD;
           assessment test. The maximum is 18 points; high scores represent better performance.&#xD;

&#xD;
        7. Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39): score obtained on the PDQ-39 scale regarding&#xD;
           the quality of life of people with PD. A lower score indicates a better perception of&#xD;
           quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS): score resulting from the HARS test; high scores&#xD;
           indicate more severe anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS or HAM-D): score obtained from the HDRS scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III.4 Description of the interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Experimental intervention - Experimental group: consists of a specific home balance&#xD;
           rehabilitation program for people with PD through functional tasks. The main strategy&#xD;
           will be to break down a daily task into static and dynamic exercises, in order to&#xD;
           experience an individualized progression within each physiotherapy session. Each session&#xD;
           will last 1 hour and there will be two sessions a week for 8 weeks. In turn, the&#xD;
           sessions will be divided into the warm-up phase (10 minutes), the central phase of&#xD;
           functional balance training (45 minutes) and the final stretching phase (5 minutes). In&#xD;
           the warm-up phase, other therapeutic objectives will be alternated to work during the&#xD;
           sessions because the experimental program focuses on balance training.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Control interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Conventional control group: they will carry out a conventional physiotherapy&#xD;
                program which covers different objectives of the rehabilitation of people with PD&#xD;
                (breathing exercises, dissociation of the waist, joint mobility, transfers and&#xD;
                postural changes, strengthening exercises, and balance training and the March).&#xD;
                Each session will last 1 hour and there will be two sessions a week for 8 weeks.The&#xD;
                format of these sessions is in a group of 6 people in the Parkinson Valencia&#xD;
                Association rehabilitation gym.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Home control group: the participants will stay at home doing the normal daily&#xD;
                activities that include housework, shopping, and daily walks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III.5 Sample size, randomization and blinding&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve the main objective proposed in this study, a total of 93 people diagnosed with PD&#xD;
      will be recruited. This sample size has been determined using the G*Power v.3.1 to detect a&#xD;
      difference between the groups (3), with a small-medium effect (f = 0.15), a statistical&#xD;
      significance of 5% at the two-tailed level, and a power of 95%. If 20% of possible dropouts&#xD;
      are also considered during the study, the initial recruitment should be 112 people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An extern researcher who is not involved in the development of the study will perform the&#xD;
      randomization process. Stratified randomization will be performed considering the Hoehn &amp;&#xD;
      Yahr stages and the cognitive state. Participants will be allocated accordingly to: 1)&#xD;
      Experimental intervention or 2) Home control group. The treating physiotherapists thereafter&#xD;
      be responsible for the management and organization of the appointments with participants. To&#xD;
      ensure masking, the assessments and the treatments were performed by different therapists.&#xD;
