      Randomized controlled trial with two groups looking at post hospital care for patients who&#xD;
      were admitted with congestive heart failure. The control group includes standard of care&#xD;
      provided to the patients after discharge including a hospital employed community health&#xD;
      worker. The intervention group receives a specially trained GrandAide following the GrandAide&#xD;
      model for post acute care. Difference in ER visits and readmissions was measured.&#xD;

      GrandAides program is a credible messenger community health worker based program that assumes&#xD;
      a community health worker from the community who has specialized education around a certain&#xD;
      chronic condition will be able to support patients in the outpatient setting more effectively&#xD;
      than current standard of care. In this study a GrandAide visited a patient discharged from&#xD;
      the hospital in their home for 4 weeks providing education, checking vital signs, and&#xD;
      assisting with communication with the cardiologist. The study measured the difference in&#xD;
      hospital admissions and ER visits between the group that was assigned a GrandAid and the&#xD;
      group that took part in standard care. The groups were assigned randomly. The difference was&#xD;
      calculated using one and two tailed t-test results.&#xD;
