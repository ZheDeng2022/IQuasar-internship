  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled, multicenter, double-blind study of healthy term infants,&#xD;
      consisting of two randomized formula-fed arms (control and experimental formulas) and a&#xD;
      non-randomized breast-fed reference group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population under investigation are healthy infants aged ≤14 days at enrollment. The&#xD;
      planned sample size for formula-fed infants is 236 (118 per study group). A non-randomized&#xD;
      breastfed reference group of 90 healthy, term, exclusively breastfed infants up to 4 months&#xD;
      will also be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study formulas are administrated orally, ad libitum, from enrollment until 15 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the trial is to demonstrate the safety of a starter infant formula&#xD;
      supplemented with pre- and probiotic(s) by comparing the growth (weight gain, g/day) of&#xD;
      infants randomized to the experimental formula versus the control formula from enrolment to 4&#xD;
      months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition fecal microbiome, fecal metabolic profile, fecal markers of immune and gut&#xD;
      health, blood markers of immune health (in a subset of 60 infants/group), GI tolerance, bone&#xD;
      index (subset of 40 infants/group), other anthropometric measurements, dietary pattern and&#xD;
      infant illness and infection outcomes will be assessed/measured.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Evidence of personally signed and dated informed consent document indicating that the&#xD;
             infant's parent(s)/ legally accepted representatives LAR have been informed of all&#xD;
             pertinent aspects of the study.&#xD;

             where the study is conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Infants whose parent(s)/LAR are willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, and&#xD;
             the requirements of the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Infants whose parent(s)/LAR are able to be contacted directly by telephone throughout&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Infants must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for&#xD;
             enrollment into the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Healthy term infant (≥37 weeks of gestation)&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. At enrollment visit, post-natal age ≤14 days/0.5 months&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Birth weight ≥ 2500g and ≤ 4500g.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. For formula-fed groups, infants must be exclusively consuming and tolerating a&#xD;
                  cow's milk infant formula at time of enrollment and their parent(s)/LAR must have&#xD;
                  independently elected, before enrollment, not to breastfeed.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. For the breastfed group, infants must have been exclusively consuming breast milk&#xD;
                  since birth, and their parent(s)/LAR must have made the decision to continue&#xD;
                  exclusively breastfeeding until at least 4 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Infants with conditions requiring infant feedings other than those specified in the&#xD;
             protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Infants who have a medical condition or history that could increase the risk&#xD;
             associated with study participation or interfere with the interpretation of study&#xD;
             results, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Evidence of major congenital malformations (e.g., cleft palate, extremity&#xD;
                  malformation)&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Suspected or documented systemic or congenital infections (e.g., human&#xD;
                  immunodeficiency virus, cytomegalovirus, syphilis)&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Previous or ongoing severe medical or laboratory abnormality (acute or chronic)&#xD;
                  which, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the infant inappropriate&#xD;
                  for entry into the study. Of note, children who are normally healthy but at the&#xD;
                  time of enrollment suffering from acute illness in a minor condition which are&#xD;
                  common in childhood and do not require some of the exclusionary medication&#xD;
                  mentioned below can be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Infants who are presently receiving or have received prior to enrollment any of the&#xD;
             following: medication(s) or supplement(s) which are known or suspected to affect the&#xD;
             following: fat digestion, absorption, and/or metabolism (e.g., pancreatic enzymes);&#xD;
             stool microbiota and characteristics (e.g., oral or systemic antibiotics, glycerin&#xD;
             suppositories, bismuth-containing medications, docusate, Maltsupex, or lactulose);&#xD;
             growth (e.g. insulin or growth hormone); gastric acid secretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Currently participating or having participated in another clinical trial since birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects or subjects' parent(s) or legal representative who are not willing and not&#xD;
             able to comply with scheduled visits and the requirements of the study protocol&#xD;
