  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the microflora characteristics of different&#xD;
      ecological loci and multiple metabolic pathways in Crohn's disease patients with different&#xD;
      disease course states.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the characteristics of microflora in the oral and tongue base,&#xD;
      small intestinal stomy and lower respiratory tract, as well as the characteristics of&#xD;
      multiple metabolic pathways such as bile acid metabolism and amino acid metabolism in Crohn's&#xD;
      disease patients with different course states.&#xD;
