  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      the study aimed to clinically evaluate the effect of micro-osteoperforations on the rate of&#xD;
      tooth movement, as evaluated by its effect on the rate of canine retraction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ten adult patients requiring maxillary first premolars' extraction were enrolled in this&#xD;
      split-mouth randomized controlled clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Micro-osteoperforations were randomly assigned to one side of the maxillary arch at the&#xD;
      canine-premolar region, and the contralateral side served as the control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mini-screws were used for anchorage reinforcement, and canine retraction was performed using&#xD;
      nickel-titanium closed coil springs, delivering a force of 150 grams per side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome was the measurement of canine retraction rate throughout the study period&#xD;
      from digital dental models obtained every 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcome was the detection of possible canine tipping during retraction.&#xD;
