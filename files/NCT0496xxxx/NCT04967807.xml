  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will focus on cardiac blood and imaging biomarkers to facilitate early recognition&#xD;
      of patients at risk for myocardial injury after COVID-19 vaccination. Ultimately, the&#xD;
      intention is to identify patients at risk, reduce adverse events, and determine the need for&#xD;
      longer-term follow-up in patients with myocardial injury after vaccination.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination frequently leads to minor side effects that&#xD;
      may be more intense after the second dose, including fatigue and pain. However, there are&#xD;
      emerging reports of more serious side effects in a minority of patients including&#xD;
      myocarditis. Given the recent introduction of COVID-19 vaccination, there is limited&#xD;
      understanding of: (i) prevalence and pattern of myocardial injury post vaccination, (ii) the&#xD;
      risk factors for myocardial injury and adverse cardiac events post vaccination, and (iii)&#xD;
      imaging and blood biomarkers for early recognition of patients at risk of adverse outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will address the above-mentioned knowledge gaps by focusing on patients who have&#xD;
      received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. The study will focus on cardiac blood and&#xD;
      imaging biomarkers to facilitate early recognition of patients at risk for myocardial injury&#xD;
      after COVID-19 vaccination. Ultimately, the intention is to identify patients at risk, reduce&#xD;
      adverse events, and determine the need for longer-term follow-up in patients with myocardial&#xD;
      injury after vaccination.&#xD;
