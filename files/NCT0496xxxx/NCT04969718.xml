  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Self-harm is now seen as an epidemic affecting young people across the world and particularly&#xD;
      in low and middle-income countries (LMIC) such as Pakistan. Young people in Pakistan often&#xD;
      come across many troubles such as mental health and family problems, stress at school and&#xD;
      social and economic inequalities. A youth suicide prevention programme is needed in Pakistan.&#xD;
      Such programme will be based on secondary schools (where most young people are) and will&#xD;
      support schools to work together with many public agencies to tackle the full range of&#xD;
      troubles that young people face. Our main research aim is to work together with multiple&#xD;
      stakeholders to culturally adapt and test the feasibility of three SEPAK interventions to&#xD;
      prevent suicide among students in secondary schools in Pakistan (aged 12 to 17 years).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There will be two research phases. In the first phase,&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Three preventative interventions will be selected and translated after reviewing the&#xD;
           international literature on youth suicide prevention programmes (e.g. SEYLE trial in&#xD;
           Europe);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Focus groups will be undertaken with multiple stakeholders (students, teachers/staff at&#xD;
           secondary schools and mental health professionals) to decide on adaptations needed to&#xD;
           the three selected interventions;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Adapted versions the three preventative SEPAK interventions will be produced after&#xD;
           incorporating the modifications recommended by the focus groups with stakeholders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second phase, the feasibility and acceptability of the three preventative SEPAK&#xD;
      interventions will be examined in 3 secondary schools (each site) and one control group (each&#xD;
      site) across five regions in Pakistan. The three preventative interventions will involve i.&#xD;
      Delivering workshops for students at secondary schools to raise awareness on mental health&#xD;
      and stresses that students face.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. Training school teachers/workers to act as facilitators and identify troubled students&#xD;
      iii. Training of health professionals (psychologists and psychiatrists) who work with young&#xD;
      people to systematically use cut-off scores of established psychometric tools for referring&#xD;
      young people to mental and social care services. Six posters on mental health awareness will&#xD;
      display in the classrooms of the school allocated to the control group.&#xD;
