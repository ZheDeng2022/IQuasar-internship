      In order to investigate the relationship between the iliac joint capsular muscle and the&#xD;
      development of the hip joint, this study used ultrasound Doppler to measure the anatomical&#xD;
      circumference of the iliac joint capsular muscle to explore the relationship.Ultrasound was&#xD;
      used to compare the size of the iliac joint cystic muscle in the three groups: patients with&#xD;
      developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH), patients with Pincer type femoral hip impingement,&#xD;
      and normal control group. The shear wave velocity and shear modulus of the iliac joint&#xD;
      capsular muscle of three groups were compared to compare the degree of fat infiltration in&#xD;
      muscle.&#xD;
