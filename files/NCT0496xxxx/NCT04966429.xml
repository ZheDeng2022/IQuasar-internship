      Hypotheses: 1. Subjects with mild post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) are at risk of&#xD;
      developing vascular dementia (VaD). Maraviroc treatment in patients suffering from mild PSCI&#xD;
      will halt its progression and improve cognitive outcome by affecting synaptic plasticity. 2.&#xD;
      CCR5 inhibition produces an anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic effect by lowering&#xD;
      macrophage infiltration and adhesion molecules. Thus, PSCI patients treated with Maraviroc&#xD;
      will present a better inflammatory profile and a deceleration of carotid atherosclerosis, vs.&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To investigate the safety and efficacy of Maraviroc 150 mg and 600 mg per day vs.&#xD;
      placebo in patients with recent subcortical stroke who experience mild PSCI on&#xD;
      progression/improvement of clinical symptoms of post-stroke cognitive impairment, change in&#xD;
      disease biomarkers and inflammatory profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include 150 participants aged 50-86 years treated with Maraviroc 150mg or&#xD;
      600mg per day compared to placebo for 12 months in 3 sites.&#xD;

      will present a better inflammatory profile and a deceleration of carotid atherosclerosis, vs.&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: 1. To investigate the safety and tolerability of Maraviroc 150 mg and 600 mg per&#xD;
      day vs. placebo in patients with recent subcortical stroke who experience mild PSCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. To evaluate the efficacy of Maraviroc 150 mg and 600 mg/day compared with placebo on&#xD;
      progression/improvement of clinical symptoms of post-stroke dementia, as assessed by a change&#xD;
      from baseline to Month 12 in composite data derived from dementia assessment cognitive&#xD;
      scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. To demonstrate the effect of Maraviroc 150/600 mg vs. placebo on additional outcomes,&#xD;
      behavioral, functional, as well as on change in disease biomarkers and inflammatory profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: The study will include recent subcortical stroke patients suffering from PSCI, white&#xD;
      matter lesions (WML) and small vessel disease (SVD), who are at risk for progression to&#xD;
      dementia. The study will assess change from baseline to Month 12 in safety parameters:&#xD;
      adverse drug reactions, incidence of treatment-emergent abnormal laboratory values, vital&#xD;
      signs, and electrocardiogram; in cognitive performance, clinical symptoms, and blood,&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid and neuroimaging measures in 150 participants aged 50-86 years treated&#xD;
      with Maraviroc 150mg or 600mg per day compared to placebo for 12 months. The study includes 3&#xD;
      sites in Israel.&#xD;
