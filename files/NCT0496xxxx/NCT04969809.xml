  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phenylketonuria is a rare metabolic disease that results from the absence or near-absence&#xD;
      activity of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, which metabolizes the amino acid&#xD;
      phenylalanine to tyrosine in the body. Accumulation of phenylalanine in the brain causes&#xD;
      brain damage that leads to mental retardation, neurological complications, and movement&#xD;
      disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is inherited autosomal recessively. The basis of treatment is a low-protein diet&#xD;
      with dietary supplements of aminoxlin without phenylalanine and with appropriate substitutes&#xD;
      for micro and macronutrients needed for different ages. A low-protein diet regulates the&#xD;
      level of phenylalanine in the blood. This is especially important in childhood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the study, which will basically consist of theoretical, experimental and numerical work,&#xD;
      the investigators will limit to a specific population, i.e. to adult patients with&#xD;
      phenylketonuria. The research is intended to prove the hypothesis that with proper&#xD;
      nutritional treatment of phenylketonuria in adulthood, we can have a positive effect on the&#xD;
      patient's well-being, better blood results and improved lifestyle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators intend to test this hypothesis by implementing a complex, multidisciplinary&#xD;
      project that will include a comprehensive treatment of adult PKU patients. This will be based&#xD;
      on a multidisciplinary approach with the inclusion of medical and nutritional treatment. As&#xD;
      part of the project, the investigators, among other things, create questionnaires and analyze&#xD;
      food diaries related to the mentioned areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using various statistical techniques, the investigators analyze the impact of individual&#xD;
      factors on the success of achieving the objectives of the proposed study. The original&#xD;
      contribution to science will be the nutritional treatment of adult patients with&#xD;
      phenylketonuria in Slovenia and the consequent reduction of health complications in adulthood&#xD;
      of patients with phenylketonuria.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Selection and presentation of the problem and formulation of goals Phenylketonuria (PKU) oz.&#xD;
      Hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) is a rare congenital metabolic disease (PPB) due to a lack of&#xD;
      phenylalanine hydroxylase (PH) activity, which metabolizes the amino acid phenylalanine (Phe)&#xD;
      to tyrosine in the body. The cause is a disease change in the PAH gene that encodes the&#xD;
      enzyme PH. A baby is born healthy, but elevated Phe levels without proper treatment cause&#xD;
      central nervous system damage and permanent mental retardation in the first months after&#xD;
      birth. The disease is the first PPB to be detected by medicine with neonatal screening tests&#xD;
      and also successfully treated with dietary treatment that excludes foods with a higher Phe&#xD;
      content from the diet. In Slovenia, the screening test was introduced in 1979 and with a&#xD;
      calculated incidence of PKU 1/6769 in Slovenia (Šmon et al., 2015), there are approximately&#xD;
      150 patients with PKU in the Slovenian registry, of which more than half are over 18 years of&#xD;
      age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutritional treatment is an important part of PKU treatment and should be performed for life&#xD;
      according to modern guidelines (Cazzorla et al., 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary treatment of PKU is one of the strictest diets, where almost all foods containing&#xD;
      protein are excluded from the food, ie all diets of animal origin (meat, milk and all dairy&#xD;
      products, eggs) as well as all cereals, legumes and nuts. Patients consume only limited&#xD;
      amounts of fruits and vegetables and special products with a removed protein content. They&#xD;
      compensate for the protein deficiency with special Phe-free protein substitutes. Adult&#xD;
      patients with PKU often do not reach the recommended levels of Phe in the blood (Green et&#xD;
      al., 2019), as the consequences of abandoning the diet in adulthood are not as obvious and&#xD;
      disturbing. By abandoning the diet, however, they also abandon follow-up in a specialist PPB&#xD;
      clinic, and according to studies, more than 70% of adult patients with PKU (study in America)&#xD;
      are no longer managed in metabolic clinics (Berry et al., 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Successful disease management often requires a lifelong diet that provides an appropriately&#xD;
      limited daily intake of Phe for growth and body regeneration with a small portion of&#xD;
      essential amino acids, vitamins, and natural food elements, and the remaining missing portion&#xD;
      of these dietary sources is added in the form of protein-fortified protein. , which does not&#xD;
      contain the amino acid Phe (MacLeod et al., 2009). Phe tolerance (mg Phe / kg body weight /&#xD;
      day) is the amount of Phe that PKU patients can consume daily while maintaining recommended&#xD;
      blood Phe levels. An individual assessment is required due to the very diverse level of Phe&#xD;
      hydroxylase enzyme activity still present (MacLeod et al., 2009). The measure of dietary&#xD;
      success is an adequate value of serum Phe and the latest European recommendations in&#xD;
      adulthood are between 120 - 600 μmol / L (van Spronsen et al., 2017; van Wegberg et al.,&#xD;
      2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research in recent years has shown significantly higher morbidity and health risk in adult&#xD;
      patients with PKU. Part of the health problems are also more present in patients who continue&#xD;
      dietary treatment, and there are even more problems in untreated patients (Burton et al.,&#xD;
      2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increased health risks have already been described, including the following medical&#xD;
      conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increased cardiovascular risk and increased atherogenic indicators (Azabdaftari et al.,&#xD;
           2019)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Higher body mass index (Robertson et al., 2013)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The impact of disease and diet on bone density (Hansen et al., 2014)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nutritional deficits (Okano et al., 2016, Moseley et al., 2002)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Higher proportion of brain dysfunction (Hoedt et al., 2012)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gastrointestinal dysbiosis (Verduci et al., 2020)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increased general comorbidity (Burton et al., 2018)&#xD;
&#xD;
      All these increased risks mean that this group of patients needs regular medical monitoring&#xD;
      even in adulthood. It is known that a proportion of patients relax their diet and thus their&#xD;
      Phe intake, but maintain a self-limiting diet with a low protein intake while not consuming a&#xD;
      protein substitute (Das et al., 2014). Adequate daily protein intake is important as it&#xD;
      ensures proper body protein synthesis and prevents catabolism (MacLeod et al., 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the research&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary goal:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Use a questionnaire in patients to assess the differences between the group of patients&#xD;
           on dietary treatment and the group of patients who discontinued treatment: demographic&#xD;
           characteristics (gender, age, education, source of income, marital status),&#xD;
           comorbidities or treatments, smoking , sleep disorders, self - assessment of physical&#xD;
           activity, self - assessment of health.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the effectiveness of the dietary intervention of individual nutrition&#xD;
           counseling for reduced Phe intake in the blood and the balance of nutrients and elements&#xD;
           in the diet by assessing the following indicators, before and after 6 months of&#xD;
           intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  quantitative reduction of Phe consumption in the diet and adequacy of Phe amino&#xD;
                acid preparation with the addition of vitamins and elements, which will be assessed&#xD;
                by measurements in the blood: Phe, amino acids, vitamins, trace elements,&#xD;
                methylmalonic acid in urine&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Compliance assessment with analysis of food diaries (at the first examination and&#xD;
                after 6 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Comparison of assessment of risk factors for atherogenesis between patients considering&#xD;
           dietary treatment and among patients without dietary treatment with ultrasound of the&#xD;
           jugular veins to assess the thickness of the carotid intima media and assessment of&#xD;
           oxidative stress in the urine sample and body composition at the start of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assessment of risk factors for atherogenesis before and after dietary intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Determine the change in body mass index, waist circumference before and after the&#xD;
                intervention, blood pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Identify the change of selected laboratory atherogenic biomarkers (total&#xD;
                lipidogram, Lp (a), homocysteine, CRP low, Il-6, TNF alpha, blood sugar, insulin)&#xD;
                Presentation of methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will invite approximately 50 adult patients with PKU who were or are still&#xD;
      being managed in the PPB clinic of the Pediatric Clinic of the University Medical Center&#xD;
      Ljubljana. It is estimated that half of the patients still fully or at least partially follow&#xD;
      the dietary treatment, while half have abandoned the treatment and mostly no longer come for&#xD;
      outpatient examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research will be conducted prospectively. Institution where the research will be&#xD;
      conducted: Clinical Department of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolic Diseases, Pediatric&#xD;
      Clinic, University Medical Center Ljubljana, Bohoričeva 20, 1000 Ljubljana&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutritional analyzes and interventional dietary counseling will be performed simultaneously&#xD;
      with the regular medical control outpatient examination before the nutritional intervention&#xD;
      and the analysis will be repeated after 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTRODUCTORY REVIEW:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound of the jugular veins to assess the thickness of the carotid intima media as a&#xD;
      non-invasive biomarker of atherosclerosis (cIMT) will be performed by a specialist as a&#xD;
      regular existing examination method during outpatient examination of the patient&#xD;
      (non-invasive ultrasound probe MyLab Gamma with QIMT® software according to the&#xD;
      manufacturer's instructions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first inspection will also include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Completion of a questionnaire (Physical Activity Questionnaire (International Physical&#xD;
           Activity Questionnaire), Sleep Questionnaire (Insomnia Severity Questionnaire (ISI)),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  performing anthropometric measurements (body weight (kg), body height (cm), waist&#xD;
           circumference (cm)) (validated scales, stadiometer, prescribed waist circumference&#xD;
           measurement procedure)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  measurement of systolic and diastolic blood pressure (mmHg) and resting pulse,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  nutrition analysis (by completing nutrition diaries and / or an interview at the&#xD;
           examination)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  taking a blood sample&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  taking a urine sample&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  body composition measurement - BIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  OGTT testing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutrition analysis and interventional nutrition counseling will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of diet To define the diet (energy and nutrient intake), the investigators use the&#xD;
      diet diary (PD) of the patient's diet for three days (3 x 24 hours (I .: 0 months = before&#xD;
      the 1st examination; PD 0)) and 3 x 24 hours, where patients food diary will be carefully&#xD;
      reviewed by a dietitian and will be entered into the Prodi® program for further processing&#xD;
      and calculation of detailed energy and nutrient intake. preparation of menus, composition of&#xD;
      individual recipes and calculation of nutrient and energy intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive one hour of nutritional counseling in a diet counseling center by a&#xD;
      clinical dietitian.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutritional counseling will be based on the nutritional assessment of the patient's condition&#xD;
      and the direction of improvement - the development of a diet plan. The dietitian will make a&#xD;
      motivational phone call each month. Written instructions will be given to the examinees.&#xD;
&#xD;
      REVIEW AFTER 6 MONTHS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inspection will include:&#xD;
&#xD;

           self-assessment of health&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  performing anthropometric measurements (body weight (kg), body height (cm), waist&#xD;
           circumference (cm)) (use of a validated balance, stadiometer, prescribed waist&#xD;
           circumference measurement procedure)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  measurement of systolic and diastolic blood pressure (mmHg),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  nutrition analysis (by completing nutrition diaries and screening interviews)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  taking a blood sample&#xD;
