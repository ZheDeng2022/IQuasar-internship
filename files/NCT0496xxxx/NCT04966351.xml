  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insufficient sleep and circadian misalignment are independent risk factors for the&#xD;
      development of obesity and diabetes, yet few strategies exist to counter metabolic&#xD;
      impairments when these behaviors are unavoidable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will examine whether avoiding food intake during the biological night can&#xD;
      mitigate the impact of circadian misalignment on metabolic homeostasis in adults during&#xD;
      simulated night shift work. Findings from this study could identify a translatable strategy&#xD;
      to minimize metabolic diseases in populations that include anyone working nonstandard hours&#xD;
      such as police, paramedics, firefighters, military personnel, pilots, doctors and nurses,&#xD;
      truck drivers, and individuals with sleep disorders.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People who work evening, night or rotating shifts (i.e. &quot;nonstandard&quot; work hours) represent&#xD;
      one in five U.S. employees and are alarmingly 44% more likely to develop Type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      (T2D) compared to people who work standard day shifts. Circadian misalignment is one&#xD;
      mechanism suggested to increases the risk of obesity and diabetes in people who work&#xD;
      non-standard hours, and is highly prevalent and often unavoidable in modern, 24-hour society&#xD;
      (e.g. shift work, long work hours, jet lag, medical residency, emergency responders, military&#xD;
      personnel, Daylight Savings Time changes, etc). Disruptions in sleep and circadian rhythms&#xD;
      have been linked to insulin resistance, increased energy intake, weight gain, and increased&#xD;
      total body, abdominal and intrahepatic fat content, yet there have been limited attempts at&#xD;
      identifying strategies or countermeasures to prevent the impact of such disruption on T2D&#xD;
      risk in a sizeable proportion of the population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the long-term goal is to identify and develop effective, behavioral&#xD;
      countermeasures to combat the increased risk for metabolic diseases associated with sleep and&#xD;
      circadian disruption when these behaviors are unavoidable. The overall objective for this&#xD;
      project is to test the impact of time-restricted feeding to a 7h period in the day as a&#xD;
      noninvasive countermeasure to the metabolic impairments associated with circadian&#xD;
      misalignment. The central hypothesis is that time-restricted feeding to the daytime period&#xD;
      will prevent metabolic impairments during circadian misalignment compared to a condition&#xD;
      where energy is consumed throughout the day and night. The rationale for the proposed project&#xD;
      is that defining a non-invasive, scalable and feasible countermeasure to circadian&#xD;
      misalignment could mitigate the risk of obesity and T2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the overall hypothesis, a randomized crossover study will be used with a rigorous&#xD;
      inpatient diet, activity and light-controlled protocol in healthy men and women. The impact&#xD;
      of time restricted feeding during circadian misalignment on metabolic homeostasis will be&#xD;
      determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Findings from this study represent a critical advancement in the fields of translational&#xD;
      circadian and metabolic physiology by identifying and testing a countermeasure to circadian&#xD;
      misalignment. Achievement of the proposed aims could lead to the development of new&#xD;
      intervention strategies for chronic disease prevention and management. The knowledge to be&#xD;
      gained offers the potential to support cost-effective programs that may inform healthcare&#xD;
      approach to metabolic disease prevention in populations at risk for these diseases such as&#xD;
      shift workers, individuals with sleep disorders and anyone who eats outside of daytime hours.&#xD;
