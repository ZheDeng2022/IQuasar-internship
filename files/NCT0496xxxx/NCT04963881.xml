      Evaluation of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) profile in Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)&#xD;
      patients with obstetric and thrombotic complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sample of the patients were taken for Anti-beta-2-glycoprotein 1(anti-b2GPI),&#xD;
      anticardiolipin (aCL) and will be analyzed on Alegria based on ELISA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is characterized by presence of specific antiphospholipid&#xD;
      antibodies (aPL) with history of thrombosis and/or pregnancy morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anti-phospholipid antibodies (aPL) is a comprehensive antibody profile which includes lupus&#xD;
      anticoagulant [LA], anticardiolipin antibodies [aCL], and/or anti-β2-glycoprotein-I&#xD;
      antibodies [aβ2GPI]). A comprehensive antibody profile is needed for both diagnosis and&#xD;
      classification of patients with APS, most significantly for the risk assessment of both&#xD;
      pregnancy morbidity and thrombosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Double positivity (LA, aβ2GPI or ACL +) and triple positivity (LA, aβ2GPI+, ACL +) may have&#xD;
      worse outcome and the patients with double and triple positivity may have recurrent&#xD;
      thrombotic events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early detection of aPL antibodies may avert patients with many complication associated with&#xD;
      SLE as well as from major thrombotic events because the detection of aPL in SLE has been&#xD;
      proposed as a predictive and specific tool for the diagnosis of APLS in SLE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      aPL profile in SLE patients with obstetric and thrombotic complications was analyzed, to see&#xD;
      the association of different anti phospholipid antibodies with different clinical features of&#xD;
      APLS in SLE patients.&#xD;
