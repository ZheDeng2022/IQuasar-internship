  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evidences have shown that systemic glucocorticoid cannot not be benefit to all of the&#xD;
      patients with AECOPD. The problem that how the clinicians can screen the patients who can&#xD;
      benefit from systemic glucocorticoid needs to be solved. Our previous study found that serum&#xD;
      metabolites profile in COPD patients differed from that in controls. Therefore, we&#xD;
      hypothesized that metabolome changes in patients with AECOPD may be associated with the&#xD;
      efficacy of systemic glucocorticoid. In this study, we will utilize ultraperformance liquid&#xD;
      chromatography / mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and gas chromatography / mass spectrometry (GC-MS)&#xD;
      methods for analysis of the metabolites in AECOPD patients and compare the metabolites&#xD;
      profiles between patients with systemic glucocorticoid treatment success and treatment&#xD;
      failure. We aim to detect the metabolic biomarkers and metabolic pathways which are related&#xD;
      to efficacy of systemic glucocorticoid and contribute to the precise treatment of COPD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) significantly increases&#xD;
      the mortality of the patients with COPD. Guidelines have recommended systemic glucocorticoid&#xD;
      as regular treatment. Recently, evidences have shown that systemic glucocorticoid cannot not&#xD;
      be benefit to all of the patients with AECOPD. Thus the problem that how the clinicians can&#xD;
      screen the patients who can benefit from systemic glucocorticoid needs to be solved urgently.&#xD;
      A previous study found that plasma metabolome changed significantly after dexamethasone&#xD;
      treatment in health participants. Furthermore, inter-person variability was high and remained&#xD;
      uninfluenced by treatment, suggesting the potential of metabolomics for predicting the&#xD;
      efficacy and side effects of systemic glucocorticoid. Our previous study found that serum&#xD;
      metabolites profile in COPD patients differed from that in controls. Therefore, we&#xD;
      hypothesized that metabolome changes in patients with AECOPD may be associated with the&#xD;
      efficacy of systemic glucocorticoid. In this study, we will utilize ultraperformance liquid&#xD;
      chromatography / mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and gas chromatography / mass spectrometry (GC-MS)&#xD;
      methods for analysis of the metabolites in AECOPD patients and compare the metabolites&#xD;
      profiles between patients with systemic glucocorticoid treatment success and treatment&#xD;
      failure. We aim to detect the metabolic biomarkers and metabolic pathways which are related&#xD;
      to efficacy of systemic glucocorticoid and contribute to the precise treatment of COPD.&#xD;
