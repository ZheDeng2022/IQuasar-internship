  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is aimed to investigate the effects of telerehabilitation-based structured exercise on&#xD;
      muscle strength, balance, performance, body image, prosthesis adaptation, activity&#xD;
      limitation, prosthesis use satisfaction, and quality of life in individuals with unilateral&#xD;
      below-knee amputation. Study hypothesis: In individuals with transtibial amputation,&#xD;
      telerehabilitation-based structured exercise has an effect on muscle strength, balance,&#xD;
      performance, body image, prosthesis adaptation, activity limitation, prosthesis use&#xD;
      satisfaction, and quality of life. Forty individuals with a unilateral transtibial amputation&#xD;
      will be included in the study. Participants will be divided into two groups as&#xD;
      telerehabilitation and control groups with equal sample sizes by the randomization method.&#xD;
      All participants will undergo a 6-week exercise program. A structured exercise program&#xD;
      supported by telerehabilitation will be applied to the telerehabilitation group 3 days a&#xD;
      week, and a home exercise program will be applied on the remaining days of the week. An only&#xD;
      a home exercise program will be applied to the control group. Participants will be evaluated&#xD;
      at the beginning and end of the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Amputation is a major trauma that significantly disrupts the biomechanics of the&#xD;
      musculoskeletal system, results in serious physical and psychological loss, and completely&#xD;
      affects the quality of life, social and professional life of the individual. Due to the&#xD;
      increase in the elderly population and the incidence of diabetes and vascular diseases in the&#xD;
      world, the number of individuals with amputation is increasing day by day. Approximately&#xD;
      150,000 lower extremity amputations are performed each year in the United States alone. The&#xD;
      number of amputated individuals worldwide is expected to double by 2050. The most common&#xD;
      amputation level in the world and in our country is transtibial amputations and approximately&#xD;
      39% of all amputations are performed at this level. In addition, the most common prosthesis&#xD;
      use among individuals with lower extremity amputations is seen in those with the transtibial&#xD;
      amputation level. Individuals who have undergone transtibial amputation have lost the&#xD;
      foot-ankle complex and all related muscular functions. After transtibial amputation surgery,&#xD;
      loss of proprioceptive information occurs in ankle control and in foot-ankle and all lower&#xD;
      extremity muscles due to loss of exteroceptors around the foot. This leads to loss of balance&#xD;
      during standing, stepping, and walking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physiotherapy and rehabilitation practices are needed in order for individuals with&#xD;
      amputations to use their prostheses effectively and have a successful prosthesis adaptation.&#xD;
      After the transtibial amputation, early period physiotherapy applications are followed by the&#xD;
      use of prosthesis, and prosthetic period rehabilitation applications are continued.&#xD;
      Prosthetic rehabilitation in individuals with transtibial amputation; aims to provide balance&#xD;
      by taking into account the losses after amputation, to gain close to normal walking with&#xD;
      minimum energy consumption, to ensure maximum independence in a safe manner by taking into&#xD;
      account the pre-amputation lifestyles, expectations, and medical limitations of individuals.&#xD;
      Physiotherapy and rehabilitation practices in individuals with transtibial amputation consist&#xD;
      of a long-term process that starts before amputation and includes the early period after&#xD;
      amputation, the prosthetic period, and returns to social life. Factors such as the long-term&#xD;
      physiotherapy needs of individuals with transtibial amputation, the presence of gait and&#xD;
      balance problems, geographical conditions, financial inadequacies, and epidemic diseases may&#xD;
      cause problems for these individuals to reach the physiotherapy and rehabilitation&#xD;
      applications offered in health institutions. In order to facilitate participation in&#xD;
      physiotherapy and rehabilitation practices and to reduce resource use, telerehabilitation&#xD;
      practices are recommended for individuals with amputation, as with other diseases that&#xD;
      require rehabilitation. It is thought that telerehabilitation can be a useful and practical&#xD;
      method for individuals with transtibial amputation where it is difficult and tiring to go to&#xD;
      the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the literature, it has been observed that there are very few studies examining the effects&#xD;
      of physiotherapy and rehabilitation on parameters such as muscle strength, balance, gait,&#xD;
      performance, body image, prosthesis fit, prosthesis use satisfaction, and quality of life in&#xD;
      the rehabilitation of individuals with transtibial amputation. In addition, there are very&#xD;
      few studies in the literature that include telerehabilitation applications related to&#xD;
      transtibial amputations, and there is no study that questions the effects of structured&#xD;
      exercise programs. This study was planned in order to determine the effects of&#xD;
      telerehabilitation applications on muscle strength, kinesiophobia, balance, activity&#xD;
      limitation, body image, prosthesis compliance and satisfaction with use, and quality of life&#xD;
      in individuals with transtibial amputation. It is aimed to guide physiotherapists whether&#xD;
      they prefer telerehabilitation applications as an evidence-based practice among&#xD;
      rehabilitation methods in this field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is aimed to investigate the effects of telerehabilitation-based structured exercise on&#xD;
      muscle strength, balance, performance, body image, prosthesis adaptation, activity&#xD;
      limitation, prosthesis use satisfaction, and quality of life in individuals with unilateral&#xD;
      transtibial amputation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to determine the number of samples in the study; the alpha significance level of the&#xD;
      hypothesis was 0.05; the effect size was determined as 0.5 and power as 0.85. As a result of&#xD;
      the analysis; The research will be carried out with a total of 40 people, 20 people in each&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty individuals with a unilateral transtibial amputation will be included in the study.&#xD;
      Participants will be divided into two groups as telerehabilitation and control groups with&#xD;
      equal sample sizes by the randomization method. All participants will undergo a 6-week&#xD;
      exercise program. A structured exercise program supported by telerehabilitation will be&#xD;
      applied to the telerehabilitation group 3 days a week, and a home exercise program will be&#xD;
      applied on the remaining days of the week. An only a home exercise program will be applied to&#xD;
      the control group. Participants will be evaluated at the beginning and end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method of the Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A mobile telecommunication group will be formed, including the participants and the&#xD;
           physiotherapist. Communication with the participants will be provided here. In addition,&#xD;
           one-on-one or collective teleconferences will be held with the participants when&#xD;
           necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before each session, the telerehabilitation group will be shown how to do the exercises&#xD;
           online by the researcher, and it will be ensured that the patients do the exercises&#xD;
           correctly and are followed up. In addition, at the beginning of each week, videos with&#xD;
           the exercise content of that week will also be sent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The control group will be given exercise cards showing the home exercise program at the&#xD;
           beginning of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tracking of the exercises will be done with the exercise diary Statistical analysis: In&#xD;
           the analysis of the data, statistical analysis including a descriptive, comparator, and&#xD;
           correlation will be made. Mean, standard deviation and percentage distributions will be&#xD;
           calculated for descriptive data. In the analysis of the repeated measurement results of&#xD;
           the scales, ANOVA will be applied for the data conforming to the normal distribution.&#xD;
           The student's t-test will be used for parametric data and Mann Whitney-U test for&#xD;
           non-parametric data.&#xD;
