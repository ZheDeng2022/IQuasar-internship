      This study is set up within the framework of the European Union regulation 2017/745 on&#xD;
      medical devices. Its objective is to confirm the performance and safety in the medium term of&#xD;
      implant-prosthetic systems including Global D dental implants: In-Kone® UNIVERSAL, In-Kone®&#xD;
      PRIMO, 3.0, twinKon® UNIVERSAL, EVL® S, EVL® K and EVL® C.&#xD;

      Study design: Ambispective multi-center observational study, on a single patient group per&#xD;
      implant, constituting a consecutive and exhaustive series of subjects, without selection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators:Twelve centers participated to the study in France and one in Greece.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives are evaluate the 5-year follow-up performance and safety of Global D dental&#xD;
      implant ranges, which consist of collecting data at a 5-year follow-up visit (prospectively&#xD;
      or retrospectively). All previous data is collected retrospectively from the patient's file.&#xD;

    <measure>Score of Quality of life (OHIP-14 - The Oral Health Impact Profile)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The score obtained from the satisfaction and quality of life questionnaire (OHIP-14) at 5 years The Oral Health Impact Profile 14 (OHIP-14) [14] is a questionnaire measuring the impact of the prosthetic restoration on the patient's well-being and quality of life. The patient answers fourteen questions grouped into seven domains (functional limitation, physical pain, psychological discomfort, physical disability, psychological disability, social disability and handicap) . For each question, the patient can answer with one of the following values: never:0, almost never:1, occasionally:2, quite often:3, very often:4. The sum of the values for each question gives a score that can vary from 0 to 56. A high score reflects a high level of discomfort.</description>
