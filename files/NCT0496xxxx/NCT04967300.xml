  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dental anxiety is defined as the fear of terrible events during dental treatment and the loss&#xD;
      of control.Anxiety may be related to adaptation of the patient to external factors in&#xD;
      environment, so the adaptation of the pediatric patient to the stimuli in the dental&#xD;
      environment may affect the level of anxiety.The aim of the this study was to evaluate the&#xD;
      relationship between sequential visits in dental treatments and dental anxiety levels of&#xD;
      pediatric patients with anxiety scales and physiological measurements.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A total of 224 children aged 5-8 years who needed at least two restorative dental treatment&#xD;
      of the mandibular first primary molar were included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each sessions the Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale (W-BFRS) was used to evaluate the&#xD;
      dental anxiety before and after the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Modified Corah's Dental Anxiety Scale (MDAS) was used as a dental anxiety measurement&#xD;
      method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A portable finger pulse oximeter (Nellcor™ PMN10, Medtronic Corp. MN, USA) was used to&#xD;
      measure the heart rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data were statistically analyzed with the help of the Statistical Package for Social Sciences&#xD;
      statistical software (SPSS 18.0), considering a 5% significance level. Nonparametric tests&#xD;
      were used. Normality assumption was evaluated with the Kolmogorov Smirnov test. The&#xD;
      association between two groups was analyzed by Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test.&#xD;

        A total of 224 children aged 5-8 years who needed at least two restorative dental&#xD;
        treatments of the mandibular first primary molar were included in the study. As the&#xD;
        inclusion criteria, children with no mental disorders, with no past dental experience,&#xD;
        hospitalization or invasive medical treatments, and no pain or symptom in their oral&#xD;
        health. All included children and parents had to spoken and understood the Turkish&#xD;
        language. Patients with chronic systemic illnesses that may affect the blood pressure or&#xD;
        heart rate of a child were excluded from the study. Only children who required&#xD;
        multiple-visit treatments were taken into consideration.&#xD;
