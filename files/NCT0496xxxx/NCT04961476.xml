  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a serious respiratory disease that results from&#xD;
      infection with a newly discovered coronavirus (SARS-COV-2). Unfortunately, COVID-19 is not&#xD;
      only a short-term infection but that patients (pts) recovering from SARS-COV2 infection&#xD;
      complain of persisting symptoms including: fatigue, diffuse myalgia and weakness, which may&#xD;
      lead to chronic fatigue syndrome. There is currently no evidence that nutritional supplements&#xD;
      and/or physical exercise can assist in the recovery of pts with chronic fatigue syndrome.&#xD;
      1-Methylnicotinamide (1-MNA) is an endogenic substance that is produced in the liver when&#xD;
      nicotinic acid is metabolized. 1-MNA demonstrates anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic&#xD;
      properties. Therefore, we investigated whether 1-MNA supplements could improve exercise&#xD;
      tolerance and decrease fatigue among patients recovering from SARS-COV-2.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study population was composed of pts after COVID-19, expressing subjective feelings of&#xD;
      limited tolerance to exercise. The selected pts were randomized into two groups: GrM0 -&#xD;
      without supplementation; GrM1 - with 1-MNA supplementation. At the beginning of the study&#xD;
      (Phase 0), in both groups, a 6-minute walk test (6MWT) was carried out and fatigue assessment&#xD;
      with Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) was performed. After 1 month (Phase 1), a fol-low up FSS&#xD;
      and 6MWT once more were performed in both groups.&#xD;
