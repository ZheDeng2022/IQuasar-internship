  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Qualified sputum samples from bronchiectasis patients were collected regularly every month&#xD;
      for three consecutive years to analyze the microbiome changes of lower respiratory tract of&#xD;
      bronchiectasis patients by metagenomic sequencing. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated and&#xD;
      the whole genome was sequenced to analyze the adaptive evolution，including virulence, quorum&#xD;
      sensing and drug resistance under host pressure. The aim of the study is to clarify the rule&#xD;
      of microflora colonization distribution and adaptive evolution in the lower respiratory tract&#xD;
      of patients with bronchiectasis, to predict the acute attack and prognosis of patients with&#xD;
      microbiome changes, and to find more new prevention and treatment methods by adjusting the&#xD;
      microbiome of the lower respiratory tract.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bronchiectasis is an abnormal, permanent dilatation of the bronchi, which presents as cough,&#xD;
      expectoration and recurrent pulmonary infections. Epidemiological survey researchs have found&#xD;
      that the number of bronchiectasis has increased rather than decreased in the last decades.&#xD;
      Asia has the highest prevalence of bronchiectasis, with 1,200 cases in every 100,000 people&#xD;
      over the age of 40 in China, and this rate can be seriously underestimated due to&#xD;
      difficulties in identifying COPD. The mortality rate of bronchiectasis patients is more than&#xD;
      twice that of the general population, placing an increasing burden on global health care&#xD;
      systems. Chronic infection in bronchiectasis is common and had a big influence on prognosis.&#xD;
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa is considered to be the most common colonization bacterium. At&#xD;
      present, the mechanism of bronchiectasis and its relationship with lower respiratory tract&#xD;
      infection have not been fully elucidated. Therefore, it is important to have an in-depth&#xD;
      understanding of the colonization distribution and adaptive evolution of the microbiome in&#xD;
      the lower respiratory tract, to predict the acute attack and prognosis with the application&#xD;
      of microbiome changes, and to find more new and effective prevention and treatment methods by&#xD;
      regulating the microbiome in the lower respiratory tract. Qualified sputum specimens from&#xD;
      bronchiectasis patients were collected regularly every month for three consecutive years.&#xD;
      Metagenomic sequencing was used to analyze the microbiome changes of lower respiratory tract&#xD;
      in these patients. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated and the whole genome was sequenced to&#xD;
      analyze the adaptive evolution of its virulence, group sensitivity and drug resistance under&#xD;
      host pressure.&#xD;
