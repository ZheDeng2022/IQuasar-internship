      -  All the patients will be included in the study will be resuscitated on arrival in our&#xD;
           department.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Detailed history will be taken and burn evaluation will take place in respect to TBSA&#xD;
           according to Lund and Browder chart and burn depth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dreesing will be done with topical antimicrobial agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fluid resuscitation with lactated Ringer's solution according to modified Parkland's&#xD;
           formula.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Injectable proton pump inhibitors, and analgesics will be started as initial drug&#xD;
           therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Close follow up of the patients will be done then evaluation of the patients will be&#xD;
           done in the fourth day and dividing the patients into two groups: the first group &quot;early&#xD;
           exicion and grafting &quot; and the second group &quot; dressing and delayed grafting &quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The first group will include patients with early surgery from 4 to 10 days since burn.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dressing will be done for the second group every other day until spontanous eschar&#xD;
           seperation or after surgiacl debridrment of adherent eschar then for delayed grafting&#xD;
           more than 10 days post burn.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Then the data will be collected and analyzed for comparison between the two groups&#xD;
           regarding : the timing of operation and its relation to the length of stay, functional&#xD;
           outcome and cost of treatment&#xD;

      -  The first group will include :&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Patients with good general condition and hemodynamically stable that fit for early&#xD;
                surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Patients that accept the option of early surgery and can give consent for it .&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Patients with available donor site for early grafting.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Patients with burn at certain sites may be of priority for early excision and&#xD;
                grafting to avoid long term complication of delayed wound healing such as : on&#xD;
                joint surface, hands, feet, and face.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The early excision will be done surgically within 4-10 days post burn by whatson knife&#xD;
           by tangential excision of burned tissue until capillary bleeding appears to make a good&#xD;
           bed to be covered with grafts&quot; split thickness grafts STG&quot; at the same time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The first dressing will be in the fifth day post operative.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the other hand the second group will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Patients with bad general condition or hemodynamicaly unstable at the early&#xD;
                excision period (4-10 days post burn).&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Patients that refuse early surgery and give no consent for early surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Patients with no available donner site for early excision and grafting during the&#xD;
                fourth day evaluation .&#xD;
