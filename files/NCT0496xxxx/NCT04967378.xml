  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to develop, implement, and assess the feasibility, acceptability, and&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy of a 10-week structured and individualized cognitive-emotional&#xD;
      intervention program for homebound older adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and with&#xD;
      depressive and/or anxiety symptoms. Homebound Elderly People Psychotherapeutic Intervention&#xD;
      (HEPPI) is designed to maintain or improve memory functioning, reduce depressive and/or&#xD;
      anxiety symptoms, and help participants to compensate or adapt to impaired cognitive&#xD;
      performance, improving their quality of life and their subjective perception of memory and&#xD;
      health.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is currently a significant increase in the number of homebound older adults due to&#xD;
      multiple physical, psychological, and/or social vulnerabilities, who require in-home support&#xD;
      services. A substantial proportion of these elderly people has MCI - more specifically&#xD;
      amnesic MCI (aMCI) - often associated with depressive and/or anxious symptomatology. Although&#xD;
      the general cognitive functioning and the daily functional capacity is relatively preserved,&#xD;
      the cognitive impairment and the emotional difficulties have a significant negative impact in&#xD;
      their quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MCI is a pathological risk condition to develop dementia, more specifically Alzheirmer's&#xD;
      disease. Thus, a significant part of homebound older adults is in the prodromal phase of this&#xD;
      disease, which represents a key moment for its early detection and for the application of&#xD;
      appropriate interventions. Indeed, older adults are able to learn new information and memory&#xD;
      strategies, as well as adapt their behavior, allowing them to benefit from such&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention programs focusing on cognition and MCI related symptomatology have revealed&#xD;
      to maintain or improve the mnesic abilities and attention capacity in older people, as well&#xD;
      as reduce depressive and/or anxiety symptoms. However, despite the growing research, there&#xD;
      are few studies applying and assessing the effectiveness of these programs in homebound older&#xD;
      adults. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility, acceptability,&#xD;
      and preliminary efficacy of the HEPPI program - a cognitive-emotional intervention program&#xD;
      for homebound older adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment and with depressive and/or anxiety&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample of homebound older adults over 65 years old with aMCI and with depressive and/or&#xD;
      anxiety symptoms is being recruited through contact with national entities that identify and&#xD;
      work directly with this population, and through contact with their social support network.&#xD;
      Participants who demonstrate interest are informed about the aims and procedures of the&#xD;
      study, and asked to sign an informed consent form before eligibility assessment. Eligible&#xD;
      participants are randomly assigned to either an experimental group, who receive the&#xD;
      intervention, or a waiting-list control group, who will receive access to HEPPI program at&#xD;
      the end of the study. Both groups complete a neuropsychological protocol to assess measures&#xD;
      of cognition, psychological health, subjective memory complaints, quality of life,&#xD;
      personality, and functional capacity. This protocol is applied in two different moments: at&#xD;
      baseline (PRE) and one week after the intervention (POS1). The study procedures take place at&#xD;
      the participants' homes.&#xD;
