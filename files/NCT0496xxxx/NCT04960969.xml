  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is increasing evidence of the effects of the time-restricted diet model based on the&#xD;
      daily intake of energy within a period of 8-12 hours on body weight control and metabolic&#xD;
      parameters. There is no study on the potential effects of this nutritional model, which is&#xD;
      thought to be an effective strategy in struggling with metabolic syndrome, on individuals'&#xD;
      eating behavior and impulsivity levels. This study, which aims to evaluate the effects of&#xD;
      time- restricted diet strategy on food intake, eating attitude and behavior and impulsivity&#xD;
      level in adults, is a mixed method, randomized controlled intervention study. Thirty adult&#xD;
      individuals between the ages of 18-65 will be included in this study, which will be carried&#xD;
      out between 31.05.2021-31.12.2021 in Istinye University. Participants will be divided into 2&#xD;
      groups: the intervention group (n = 15) will apply a time-restricted nutrition model for 4&#xD;
      weeks, and no intervention will be applied to the control group (n = 15). Participants' food&#xD;
      intake before and after the intervention period will be evaluated with a 3-day food intake&#xD;
      record, their eating attitudes will be evaluated with the Eating Attitude Test (EAT-26),&#xD;
      their impulsivity levels will be evaluated with the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-Short Form&#xD;
      (BIS-11-SF) and Go / NoGo test, and their eating behaviors will be evaluated with the Three&#xD;
      Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ-R21). At the end of the research, all individuals in the&#xD;
      intervention group will be interviewed in depth and their experiences regarding the process&#xD;
      will be recorded. IBM SPSS 22 program will be used in the analysis of all quantitative data,&#xD;
      and the MAXQDA-12 program will be used in the analysis of qualitative data. The data obtained&#xD;
      from this research will clear up the applicability of the time- restricted diet model and its&#xD;
      effects on eating behaviors of adults.&#xD;
