  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the nutritional status, nutritional support and postoperative complications of&#xD;
      patients undergoing spinal orthopedic surgery during the perioperative period.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adopting the method of continuous fixed point sampling, the inpatients in the orthopedic ward&#xD;
      of our hospital were selected as the objects of investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1) Data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. general data: The information of gender, age, ethnicity, height, weight, course of&#xD;
           disease, family history, combined diseases, medication etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Nutritional assessment：①Nutritional risk screening tool 2002(NRS 2002), an&#xD;
           evidence-based nutritional risk screening tool developed by the European Society for&#xD;
           Parenteral and Endoenteral Nutrition, was recommended by the Chinese Society for&#xD;
           Parenteral and Endoenteral Nutrition as a nutritional risk screening tool for inpatients&#xD;
           in China. The total NRS 2002 was divided into three scores, namely disease severity&#xD;
           score, impaired nutritional status score and age score. NRS 2002 score ≥3 (accompanied&#xD;
           by poor general conditions, such as weight loss, appetite, mental state, etc.) are at&#xD;
           nutritional risk and require nutritional support; Those with a score less than 3 have no&#xD;
           nutritional risk and do not need nutritional support. ②Other indicators include height,&#xD;
           weight and body mass index, as well as biochemical indicators such as pre-albumin and&#xD;
           hemoglobin. Nutritional assessment was performed within 24 hours of admission, on the 1d&#xD;
           after surgery, on the 7d after surgery, every 7d after surgery, or upon discharge. NRS&#xD;
           2002 was repeated to assess patients' nutritional risk at the first review three months&#xD;
           after discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Nutritional support: The nutritional support received during the hospital was recorded,&#xD;
           including the form of nutritional support (enteral or parenteral nutrition), energy&#xD;
           ratio, variety selection, duration of administration, etc. 1 g carbohydrate provided&#xD;
           16.74 kJ(4 kcal) calories, 1 g fat milk provided 38.93 kJ(9.3 kcal) calories and 1 g&#xD;
           amino acid provided 16.74 kJ(4 kcal) calories to calculate the energy provided by the&#xD;
           nutritional support program. The amount of nitrogen provided by the nutritional support&#xD;
           program was calculated with about 1 g nitrogen provided by 6.25 g amino acids.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Complications: Postoperative complications, such as sepsis, pneumonia, urinary tract&#xD;
           infection, wound infection, and delayed wound healing, were recorded during&#xD;
           hospitalization and within 3 months after discharge.&#xD;
