  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A trial study was proposed as part of the project &quot;Biocomposite Packaging for Active&#xD;
      Preservation of Food&quot; (acronym BIOFOODPACK) that has been funded by the M-ERA.Net Call 2016.&#xD;
      A crossover trial with a behavioral intervention study will be conducted. The behavioural&#xD;
      intervention treatment consists of: i) avoiding the consumption of packaged (cans, plastic,&#xD;
      paper) ready to consume foods, and foods from take away/delivery/fast food, and ii) using the&#xD;
      proposed bio-based packaging material to package foods ready for consumption; this bio-based&#xD;
      packaging material (Silvex Ltd, Portugal) does not contain plasticizers, it is biodegradable&#xD;
      and made out of plant-based materials (corn, starch, etc.). The objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To describe the body burden of plasticizers for women aged 18-40 years systematically&#xD;
           adopting the intervention treatment package during the 5-day period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the diurnal variability of the plasticizers, based on regular daily activities&#xD;
           of the young adult women.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The duration of this study will be 12 days; the intervention period will last for 5-days,&#xD;
      followed by the 2-day wash out and then another 5-day period for the conventional period (as&#xD;
      usual) (Figure 1). During the 5-day long intervention period, all participants will be asked&#xD;
      to: i) refrain from packaged (cans, plastic, paper) ready to consume foods, and foods from&#xD;
      take away/delivery/fast food and ii) use the bio-based food packaging material to package&#xD;
      their food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be randomly allocated to the treatment period or the conventional&#xD;
      period (as usual scenario) for 5 days, each and following a washout period of 2 days, they&#xD;
      will use the biodegradable food packaging material and no plastic packaging for their ready&#xD;
      to eat foods for the next 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A baseline questionnaire will be used to collect information on demographic characteristics,&#xD;
      individual habits, diet and non-dietary potential endocrine-disruptive chemicals exposures,&#xD;
      while a diary will be used daily by participants so that they report the time for consumption&#xD;
      of packaged food/drinks, for use of personal care products and for other activities like&#xD;
      handwashing and use of microwave. Both the baseline questionnaire and diary will be developed&#xD;
      online using the REDCap platform. Participants will provide us with an informed consent that&#xD;
      they will strictly follow the protocol in both phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standardized methodologies to quantify endocrine-disruptive chemicals (bisphenols, free and&#xD;
      total) in urine samples and in packaged food using standardized protocols will be used. Urine&#xD;
      samples will be analyzed at the Water and Health laboratory for plasticizers (bisphenols both&#xD;
      free and total forms) using established human biomonitoring methods. The methods for the&#xD;
      plasticizer compounds will be those used by the U.S. CDC. Standardized measurements for&#xD;
      metabolomics and cortisol will also take place.&#xD;
