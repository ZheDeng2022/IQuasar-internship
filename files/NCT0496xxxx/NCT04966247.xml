  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aortic arch repair surgery is a technically complex and challenging procedure to treat aortic&#xD;
      pathologies. Despite advancements in perioperative care, detrimental neurological&#xD;
      complications occur during or after surgery. The neurological complications increase the&#xD;
      economic burden of healthcare, morbidity and quality of life for the patients, even if they&#xD;
      survive. Stroke, for example, leads to an increase in healthcare and social care costs,&#xD;
      requiring a subsequent lengthy rehabilitation. Milder neurological impairments include&#xD;
      transient ischaemic attacks, confusion and delirium, necessitating longer intensive care and&#xD;
      hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently applied cerebral monitoring modalities are electroencephalogram and cerebral&#xD;
      oximetry, and they are not specific enough to timely detect early cerebral ischaemia to&#xD;
      prevent the neurological complications. S100B protein, neuron-specific enolase, and glial&#xD;
      fibrillary acidic protein are serum markers that reflect cerebral damage, however, their&#xD;
      applicability in the hyperacute setting is limited. Recent studies reveal more sensitive&#xD;
      biomarkers of glucose, lactate, pyruvate, glutamate and glycerol. These biomarkers could&#xD;
      potentially detect cerebral ischaemia on a real time basis using continuous microdialysis&#xD;
      method. The primary aim of the project is to develop a bedside system to continuously monitor&#xD;
      and detect cerebral ischaemia on a real time basis during surgery and in the intensive care&#xD;
      unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Central venous catheters are routinely used to monitor central venous pressure, sampling&#xD;
      blood and administration of medications during surgery and intensive care stay. Microdialysis&#xD;
      catheter can collect blood dialysate directly from the central venous catheter, and cerebral&#xD;
      ischaemic biomarkers can be monitored continuously. Immediate detection of cerebral ischaemia&#xD;
      could mandate more aggressive cerebral protection strategies by further optimisation of&#xD;
      hypothermia and antegrade selective cerebral perfusion during surgery, and optimisation of&#xD;
      blood pressure and oxygenation in the intensive care unit. Ultimately, early detection of&#xD;
      cerebral ischemia using microdialysis during surgery will prevent disabling and costly&#xD;
      neurological complications following surgery.&#xD;
