      Descriptive safety and pharmacokinetics of GT300, exploratory biomarker effects for the&#xD;

      and fasting effect on biomarkers.&#xD;

      This is a two-part study to be conducted under double-blind conditions. Part A will be&#xD;
      conducted first and completed before Parts B is conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A is a single ascending dose evaluation of GT300 under double blind conditions in a&#xD;
      population of healthy male and female subjects. Part B will be conducted once follow-up of&#xD;
      the last cohort Part A has been conducted. On each study day in which drug is administered,&#xD;
      dosing will be &quot;staggered&quot;. Additionally, during Part A, a &quot;sentinel&quot; group comprising 1&#xD;
      active and 1 placebo subject will be dosed approximately 24 hours prior to dosing the&#xD;
      remaining 6 subjects in group 1 (5 active, 1 placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conduct of the study including clinical evaluation of subjects (up to the safety review&#xD;
      meeting) will be under double-blind conditions. Progress from one cohort to the next will be&#xD;
      contingent on satisfactory review of the safety and other data from each cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B is a single dose evaluation of the effect of food and prolonged fasting on the GT300&#xD;
      PK and biomarkers. The dose of GT300 will be equal to, or less than the maximum dose&#xD;
      evaluated in Part A.&#xD;
