    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disorders of bone and mineral metabolism particularly parathyroid disorders like multiple&#xD;
      endocrine neoplasia type 1, jaw tumor syndrome, familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia,&#xD;
      parathyroid cancer, osteoporosis, and Paget s disease. Advances have been made in the past&#xD;
      few decades. But, there remains a significant gap in the knowledge about these disorders.&#xD;
      Researchers want to collect information from people with these disorders to learn more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To create a collection of data and samples that researchers can use for studies of bone and&#xD;
      mineral metabolism or other related diseases or conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 6 months or older who have or are at risk of having a bone and mineral metabolism&#xD;
      disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a review of their medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be seen, tested, and treated by doctors based on their condition. Their&#xD;
      visits may be in person or via telehealth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete questionnaires. They will answer questions about their physical,&#xD;
      mental, and social health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may give samples such as saliva, blood, urine, or stool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may give cheek cell samples. They will do this using a cheek swab or by spitting&#xD;
      into a cup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult participants may give a skin biopsy. For this, a small bit of skin is removed with a&#xD;
      punch tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have medical photos taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants have surgery during the course of their regular care either at the NIH&#xD;
&#xD;
      or at a different hospital or doctor s office, researchers will ask for some of the leftover&#xD;
&#xD;
      tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will remain in the study indefinitely and may be followed longitudinally on a as&#xD;
      needed basis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Metabolic bone disorders are very common in the general population and include parathyroid&#xD;
      disorders like multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1, jaw tumor syndrome, familial&#xD;
      hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, parathyroid cancer, osteoporosis and Paget s disease. Although&#xD;
      significant advances have been made in the last few decades, these advances have not&#xD;
      translated as successfully to advances in patient care. Additionally, developments in rare&#xD;
      bone disorders and evidence to guide optimal provision of care to patients affected with them&#xD;
      are fundamental gaps in our knowledge. Few leading academic institutions have a comprehensive&#xD;
      center for diagnosis, treatment and investigation of bone and mineral disorders. The&#xD;
      Metabolic Diseases Branch of the NIDDK has been studying patients with metabolic bone&#xD;
      disorders for several decades and has developed an extensive cohort of patients who have&#xD;
      contributed to research protocols for many years. Thus, the Metabolic Diseases Branch of the&#xD;
      NIDDK is uniquely situated to collect a wealth of samples and data on patients with these&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this protocol is to create a repository of samples and data obtained during&#xD;
      standard clinical care that can be used for future research. These samples and data will be&#xD;
      stored indefinitely and will be used for future research in metabolic bone disorders and&#xD;
      related diseases.&#xD;
