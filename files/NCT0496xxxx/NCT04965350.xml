      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of three consecutive&#xD;
      lots of bivalent HPV (Type 16,18) vaccine (Pichia pastoris) in healthy female subjects aged 9&#xD;
      - 30 years, and demonstrate the non-inferiority of the candidate HPV vaccine manufactured at&#xD;
      commercial scale compared with a pilot scale.&#xD;
