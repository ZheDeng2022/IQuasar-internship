      Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) is a drug adverse reaction and a&#xD;
      potentially serious complication. MRONJ is defined as the presence of exposed bone with&#xD;
      intraoral or extraoral fistula in the maxillofacial region that does not heal for at least 8&#xD;
      weeks, seen in patients receiving antiresorptive or antiangiogenic agents but without a&#xD;
      history of head and neck radiotherapy. Several treatment strategies have been recommended&#xD;
      according to the stage of MRONJ, ranging from pharmacological conservative management to&#xD;
      aggressive surgical approaches. According to the American Association of Oral and&#xD;
      Maxillofacial Surgeons (AAOMS) position paper updated in 2014, conservative treatment for&#xD;
      stage 0 and 1, minimally invasive surgical treatment for stage-2, and radical surgical&#xD;
      treatment for stage-3 have been recommended. Furthermore, there is no consensus for the&#xD;
      treatment of MRONJ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The innermost membrane of the placenta; the human amniotic membrane (HAM), is an avascular&#xD;
      membrane consisting of 5 layers: epithelium, basement membrane, compact layer, fibroblast&#xD;
      layer, and spongy layer. HAM was used in many animal and human studies in the field of oral&#xD;
      and maxillofacial surgery; for guided tissue regeneration, vestibuloplasty, temporomandibular&#xD;
      joint surgery, closure of oroantral communication/fistula, periodontal surgery, oral mucosal&#xD;
      defects, periapical endodontic surgery, cleft palate, and MRONJ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to provide mucosal coverage using HAM after sequestrectomy in&#xD;
      patients with stage-2 MRONJ. In this case series, results of surgical treatment with HAM&#xD;
      transplantation in 5 MRONJ cases were reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All donors were selected from volunteers undergoing elective cesarean section at Trakya&#xD;
      University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology. Cryopreserved HAM&#xD;
      was prepared as described previously by Kar et al. After preoperative clinical and&#xD;
      radiographic evaluations, 14 MRONJ cases with stage-2 diagnosis were treated with HAM&#xD;
      transplantation. Preoperative pain was evaluated by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) from &quot;0&quot; (as&#xD;
      no pain) to &quot;10&quot; (as the most severe pain experienced).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before surgery, patients were treated with combined oral antibiotics (amoxicillin/clavulanic&#xD;
      acid 1,000 mg + metronidazole 500 mg), oral analgesics (dexketoprofen 25 mg) and,&#xD;
      antimicrobial mouth rinse (0.2% chlorhexidine digluconate) for 3 weeks. Surgical treatment&#xD;
      was performed in patients who still had an infection (pain, erythema, or purulent discharge)&#xD;
      and pain despite the medical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical Method HAM was removed from the -80 °C freezer half an hour before the operation. 4%&#xD;
      articaine hydrochloride with 1:100 000 adrenalin was used for anesthesia. Sequestrectomy was&#xD;
      performed until fresh bleeding from bone was confirmed, with a flapless approach or a minimal&#xD;
      flap elevation. After the sequestrectomy was completed, the amniotic membrane was placed in&#xD;
      two layers. The deep layer HAM was placed to cover the bone surface. The superficial layer&#xD;
      HAM was sutured with a resorbable suture (4.0 polyglactin) to the edges of the mucosa to&#xD;
      cover the underlying bone completely. All bone specimens were histopathologically evaluated&#xD;
      to exclude a metastatic bone malignancy or a primary malignancy of jaws. The medications&#xD;
      described before were prescribed for 1 week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first postoperative follow-up period, patients were evaluated in terms of infection&#xD;
      (pain, erythema, and purulent drainage), mucosal coverage, and post-operative pain at 1, 2,&#xD;
      4, 8, and 12 weeks. Patients who showed improvement (total mucosal coverage, no sign of&#xD;
      infection and pain) at the end of 12 weeks were followed up every 8 weeks. Also, radiographic&#xD;
      examinations (panoramic radiography at every 8 weeks and cone-beam computed tomography at&#xD;
      every 6 months) were performed to evaluate the progression of bone destruction&#xD;
      postoperatively.&#xD;
