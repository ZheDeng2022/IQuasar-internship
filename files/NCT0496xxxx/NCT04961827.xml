  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Healthy eating is linked to improved survival and quality of life among cancer survivors.&#xD;
      However, previous studies showed that most cancer survivors were not adhering to dietary&#xD;
      recommendations despite having made changes post-diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional nutrition counseling interventions are often used in this population. However,&#xD;
      they are labor and cost intensive and involved multiple sessions with participants. Written&#xD;
      materials have often been used to facilitate improvements of dietary quality beyond nutrition&#xD;
      counseling sessions but are outdated. Therefore, we propose to develop and test the&#xD;
      effectiveness of a dietary intervention aiming to enhance self-efficacy through sending&#xD;
      images through instant messaging. Methods to increase self-efficacy include performance&#xD;
      accomplishment, persuasion, modelling and peer-modelling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective, randomized controlled trial design will be used to test the effectiveness of&#xD;
      the intervention. A total of 168 adult Chinese cancer survivors, diagnosed with&#xD;
      non-metastatic cancer (Stages 0-III), and have completed all active treatments, including&#xD;
      surgery and adjuvant treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned into one of two groups at a 1:1 ratio, using&#xD;
      computer-generated block randomization sequences. The first group will be an active control&#xD;
      group. Participants in this group will receive knowledge-based dietary information through an&#xD;
      instant messaging applications biweekly for 6 times. The second group will be the&#xD;
      intervention group. Participants will receive biweekly self-efficacy enhancing materials for&#xD;
      6 times. Materials will provide information about behavior-health link, provide information&#xD;
      on consequences, provide instruction, and provide opportunities for social comparison. For&#xD;
      example, the materials will provide recipe ideas and meal planning samples from fellow cancer&#xD;
      survivors. All materials will be developed by a registered dietitian and will be consistent&#xD;
      with published dietary guidelines for cancer survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have follow-up appointments at 3 months. Their dietary quality and skin&#xD;
      carotenoid status will be monitored. It is hypothesized that dietary quality will be better&#xD;
      and skin carotenoid status will be higher for participants in the intervention group compared&#xD;
      to participants in the active control group.&#xD;
