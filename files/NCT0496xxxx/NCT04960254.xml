  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Excessive problematic use of the internet has been a topic of discussion in the academic&#xD;
      literature for many years and has gained more attention recently. The majority of those at&#xD;
      risk are in early adulthood. Pathological internet use (PIU) is also termed internet&#xD;
      addiction disorder (IAD), with both terms used to link internet use with addiction&#xD;
      terminology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consistent with other psychiatric conditions such as depression symptoms, PIU prevalence&#xD;
      rates among adolescents vary widely from as low as 0.3% to 38%. Likewise, PIU prevalence&#xD;
      among college students (young adults) showed a wide variation ranging from 3% to 34%,&#xD;
      worldwide. Nowadays, internet gaming addiction became a problematic issue in adolescent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a case -control study, aimed to evaluate the prevalence and risk factors of internet&#xD;
      gaming addiction among adolescents and its relationship with emotion regulation and comorbid&#xD;
      psychiatric disorders.&#xD;
