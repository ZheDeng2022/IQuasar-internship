  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phosphatidylserine is a phospholipid found in high concentrations in the brain and nervous&#xD;
      tissues along with naturally occurring in many foods. It has been extensively studied for its&#xD;
      effects on improving cognitive function, learning, memory and alleviating stress. However,&#xD;
      more recently it has been proposed that phosphatidylserine could improve exercise capacity.&#xD;
      The mechanisms of proposed action are difficult to distinguish because of the limited&#xD;
      research and therefore the purpose of this study is to identify the proposed mechanism of&#xD;
      action of phosphatidylserine supplementation and to establish whether these mechanisms will&#xD;
      have an effect on time trial performance in trained male cyclists.&#xD;
