  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current proposal is to generate &quot;proof of concept&quot; evidence that hemianopia can be&#xD;
      successfully rehabilitated in humans when this multisensory rehabilitation paradigm is used.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The over-arching objective is to evaluate the functional recovery of vision in hemianopic&#xD;
      patients engaged with a multisensory training paradigm. Unilaterally blind participants will&#xD;
      participate in weekly training sessions in which they are exposed to high-density&#xD;
      spatiotemporally congruent and consistent visual-auditory stimulation. The participants will&#xD;
      be tested on a battery of visual tasks probing different levels of function in different&#xD;
      environments in a longitudinal study to track recovery.&#xD;

    <description>The Humphrey visual field test measures the entire area of peripheral vision that can be seen while the eye is focused on a central point. The Humphrey visual field test can also be used to detect conditions within the optic nerve of the eye, and certain neurological conditions as well. A normal visual field measures about 90 degrees temporally, 50 degrees superiorly and nasally, and 60 degrees inferiorly. (higher scores are better)</description>

    <description>In initial (&quot;training&quot;) sessions, subjects will be exposed (and respond) to spatiotemporally congruent pairs of visual-auditory stimuli presented within their blinded field, with occasional probes of unisensory visual stimuli on both sides of space. Once recovery of visual responsiveness in the contralesional field is observed, sessions will alternate between &quot;training/testing&quot; and &quot;testing only&quot; sessions in which performance on the visual battery will be re-assessed.</description>
