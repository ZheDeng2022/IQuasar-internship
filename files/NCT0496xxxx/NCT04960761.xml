      Behavioral practices applied to the child in the preoperative period; It includes methods&#xD;
      such as introducing the hospital and operating room to children and their parents, reading&#xD;
      storybooks, giving training books, an educational internet application with interactive&#xD;
      games, and using visual aids. At the same time, by using an appropriate anatomy book, it can&#xD;
      help the child to visualize his body correctly, to understand the size and location of the&#xD;
      surgical site, and to learn where the suture will be after the intervention.In this study, it&#xD;
      was aimed to evaluate the effect of preoperative education with the help of audio and picture&#xD;
      books on postoperative anxiety, quality of life and early mobilization.&#xD;

      Psychological preparation process in the pre-operative period; It reduces anxiety, uses less&#xD;
      anesthetic during the operation, normalizes vital signs in a short time, uses less&#xD;
      painkillers and helps early discharge. Behavioral practices applied to the child in the&#xD;
      preoperative period; It includes methods such as introducing the hospital and operating room&#xD;
      to children and their parents, reading storybooks, giving training booklets, an educational&#xD;
      internet application with interactive games, and using visual aids. At the same time, by&#xD;
      using an appropriate anatomy book, it can help the child to visualize his body correctly, to&#xD;
      understand the size and location of the surgical site, and to learn where the suture will be&#xD;
      after the intervention. No study was found in which children aged 8-12 years were educated&#xD;
      with the help of audio and picture books before appendectomy and evaluated postoperative&#xD;
      anxiety, quality of life and mobilization time. In this study, it was aimed to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of preoperative education with the help of audio and picture books on postoperative&#xD;
      anxiety, quality of life and early mobilization. The study was planned randomized controlled&#xD;
      study. The statistical universe of this study, includes pediatric patients who operated&#xD;
      between February 2021 and December 2021 in Pediatric Surgery Department in Zeynep Kamil&#xD;
      Maternity and Children's hospital. The sample includes who operated with appendectomy between&#xD;
      the ages of 8 and 12 who met the inclusion criteria in the Pediatric Surgery Clinic as 60&#xD;
      children. Participants will be divided into two equal groups as intervention (n=30) and&#xD;
      control (n=30) groups. Children and Parents Descriptive Characteristics Form, State Anxiety&#xD;
      Inventory for Children, State Anxiety Inventory (for Parents), Quality of Life Scale for&#xD;
      Children, Evaluation of Postoperative Mobilization Time will be used to collect data. Data&#xD;
      will be analyzed with appropriate statistical methods using the SPSS for Windows 22.0 program&#xD;
      (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences). Descriptive statistical methods such as&#xD;
      percentile, mean, standard deviation and median in the evaluation of data and&#xD;
      Kolmogorov-Smirnov distribution test for examining normal distribution, chi-square test,&#xD;
      t-test/Mann Whitney-U test for measurement data, One-Way ANOVA/Kruskall Wallis tests will be&#xD;
      used.&#xD;
