    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single arm, single center clinical study to determine the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of pablizumab combined with apatinib and neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with&#xD;
      stage iia-iiia non-small cell lung cancer. No EGFR mutation or ALK gene translocation was&#xD;
      found in the untreated patients with NSCLC stage IIa-IIIb diagnosed by imaging,&#xD;
      histopathology or cytology. After informed consent is signed by the patients. The patients&#xD;
      were treated according to the protocols. The patients were followed up from adjuvant&#xD;
      treatment and follow-up to relapse free survival until disease progression, withdrawal of&#xD;
      informed consent, loss of follow-up or death.&#xD;
