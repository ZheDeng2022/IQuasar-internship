    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators propose to systematically collect and analyse epigastric&#xD;
      lymph nodes during complete cytureductive surgery in patients with colorectal carcinomatosis,&#xD;
      in order to define their role in the dissemination of colorectal metastases&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Twenty percent of&#xD;
      the patients with CRC develop distant metastases. Among them, 50% have liver metastases (LM)&#xD;
      and 25% have peritoneal metastases (PM). Half of these metastatic patients will present with&#xD;
      liver-only hepatic metastases (HM) and a quarter will have just peritoneal metastases (PM).&#xD;
      The peritoneum representing the second metastatic site in frequency. Patients with colorectal&#xD;
      PM have a dismal prognosis in comparison with other metastatic sites. For patients with&#xD;
      limited resectable peritoneal disease, surgery remains the only potentially curative option.&#xD;
      The two major prognostic factors in patients undergoing cytoreductive surgery (CRS) for PM&#xD;
      are the extent of the disease, as evaluated by the peritoneal cancer index (PCI) and the&#xD;
      completeness of the resection. In patients undergoing complete macroscopic CRS, the 5-years&#xD;
      overall survival (OS) is up to 45% in patients with a PCI &lt;6, whereas OS falls to just 9%&#xD;
      when PCI is &gt;19. At the present time, however, only a minority (16%) of the patients who&#xD;
      undergo surgery with a curative-intent for PM are cured, as indicated by disease-free&#xD;
      survival (DFS) &gt;10-years. Despite an aggressive combined approach (surgery and chemotherapy),&#xD;
      most of these patients will die from loco-regional and/or systemic recurrence. This&#xD;
      emphasizes the needs for a better characterization of the disease and for identification of&#xD;
      more accurate selection criteria for surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Very few studies have explored the pathophysiological mechanisms of PM development and&#xD;
      progression. The main mechanism of reported peritoneal dissemination that has been reported&#xD;
      is a stepwise dissemination including the exfoliation of tumoral cells from the primary&#xD;
      tumour into the peritoneal cavity. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying systemic&#xD;
      dissemination in patients presenting with PM are also poorly understood. The most well-known&#xD;
      lymphatic dissemination pathways from the peritoneum into supra-diaphragmatic lymph nodes&#xD;
      (LNs) are the retroperitoneal lymphatic pathway and the cardio-phrenic LNs. The presence of&#xD;
      involved cardio-phrenic LNs is predictive of PM involvement. However, detection of these LNs&#xD;
      is based on imaging that has a limited sensitivity (65%) and surgical access requires the&#xD;
      opening of the diaphragm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the investigators reported, for the first time, a new lymphatic route of systemic&#xD;
      dissemination of colorectal PM. The investigators reported LN metastases in the inferior&#xD;
      epigastric LN basin (IELN). In this series, metabolic and morphologic imaging were not able&#xD;
      to preoperatively predict the status of IELN. These LNs represent potential predictive&#xD;
      factors of survival in patients treated for colorectal PM. The advantage of this LN basin is&#xD;
      its easy surgical access that allows resection without increasing postoperative&#xD;
      complications. The exact conditions for dissemination in IELN and their prognostic role&#xD;
      remain undetermined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the incidence of IELN basin involvement in&#xD;
      patients with colorectal PM undergoing complete CRS. The secondary objectives are to evaluate&#xD;
      the capacity of preoperative imaging to detect these lesions and to define conditions for&#xD;
      IELN involvement.&#xD;
