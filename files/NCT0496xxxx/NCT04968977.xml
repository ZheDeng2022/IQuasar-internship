  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Left main (LM) coronary artery disease is associated with high morbidity and mortality owing&#xD;
      to the large myocardial territory at risk for ischemia. Evidence from randomized controlled&#xD;
      trials supports that percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stents (DES)&#xD;
      for LM disease is an acceptable treatment strategy compared with coronary artery bypass graft&#xD;
      surgery in patients with low or intermediate anatomic complexity. However in-stent restenosis&#xD;
      (ISR) after DES in LM disease is still occurring with an incidence of 9,7%. Studies comparing&#xD;
      the percutaneous coronary intervention with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in the&#xD;
      treatment of in-stent restenosis in unprotected left main have been scarce. While surgical&#xD;
      revascularization is considered to be the standard treatment for this kind of stent failure,&#xD;
      owing to a high risk of perioperative morbidity and mortality, the restoration of flow with&#xD;
      PCI may be a reliable alternative. Additionally, it is not clear whether re-PCI is safe in&#xD;
      these patients. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to compare long-term outcomes&#xD;
      following PCI or CABG for UPLM-ISR disease.&#xD;

        A total of 305 unselected patients were included in the pooled analysis, of whom 203&#xD;
        (66.6%) patients were treated with a PCI and 102 (33.4%) with a CABG.&#xD;

        Patients were divided into two separate cohorts for the analyses. The data included&#xD;
        consecutive patients with ≥50% diameter UPLM-ISR, with or without multivessel coronary&#xD;
        artery disease. Patients with an equivalent of UPLM-ISR: left main distal bifurcation&#xD;
        disease, within the proximal 5 mm of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) or left&#xD;
        circumflex artery (LCx) ostium (in the absence of significant angiographic stenosis in the&#xD;
        left main coronary artery), were eligible. Patients who had protected LM-ISR, defined as&#xD;
        the occurrence of at least one patent arterial or venous graft to the left coronary artery,&#xD;
        other concomitant non-CABG procedure during surgery, were excluded.&#xD;
