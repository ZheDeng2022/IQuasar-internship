  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is designed to evaluate the effects of oral antifungal treatment with posaconazole&#xD;
      on active Crohn's disease (CD) activity and the burden of Malassezia spp. in CD patients with&#xD;
      the CARD9 S12N risk allele. Further, this project will investigate the hypothesis that the&#xD;
      microbial changes induced by antifungal treatment are associated with dampened downstream&#xD;
      immune responses in those with a genetic predisposition to developing strong immune responses&#xD;
      to Malassezia.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Endoscopic Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as ≥ 50% reduction from baseline in Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease (SES-CD). The SES-CD evaluates 4 endoscopic variables: ulcer size, ulcerated surface, affected surface, and presence of narrowings. The total SES-CD is calculated as the sum of the 4 variables for the 5 bowel segments: rectum, left colon, transverse colon, right colon, and ileum. Scores range from 0 to 60, with higher scores indicating more severe disease.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Induction of Clinical Remission</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as Patient-Reported Outcome (PRO2) abdominal pain score ≤1 AND stool frequency ≤3, and Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) (&lt;150).&#xD;
PRO2 is the weighted average of the 2 variables of frequency of liquid or very soft stool and abdominal pain, based on 7-day participant diary data. The PRO2 score has a minimum score of 0 and has no upper bound, with a higher score indicating more frequent stools and more severe abdominal pain.&#xD;
The CDAI is a weighted, composite index of 8 disease variables (stool frequency, severity of abdominal pain, degree of general well-being, presence or absence of extra-intestinal manifestations or fistula, use or non-use of antidiarrheal agents, presence or absence of an abdominal mass, hematocrit, and body weight). Scores range from approximately 0 to 600, with a higher score indicating more-severe disease activity.</description>

    <description>Defined as a Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease (SES-CD) score of ≤3. The SES-CD evaluates 4 endoscopic variables: ulcer size, ulcerated surface, affected surface, and presence of narrowings. The total SES-CD is calculated as the sum of the 4 variables for the 5 bowel segments: rectum, left colon, transverse colon, right colon, and ileum. Scores range from 0 to 56, with higher scores indicating more severe disease.</description>
