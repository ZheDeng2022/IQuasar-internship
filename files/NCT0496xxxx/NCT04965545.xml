      The investigators aimed to identify factors associated with symptoms and features of Wilson&#xD;
      disease from a large cohort during long-term follow-up&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive disorder that impairs copper homeostasis and is&#xD;
      caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in ATP7B, which encodes a&#xD;
      copper-transporting P-type ATPase. Patients have variable clinical manifestations and&#xD;
      laboratory test results, resulting in diagnostic dilemmas. Therefore, the investigators aimed&#xD;
      to identify factors associated with symptoms and features of Wilson disease, thereby give&#xD;
      timely diagnosis for patients.&#xD;
