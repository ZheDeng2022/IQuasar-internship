  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), there is a buildup of nitrogenous uremic&#xD;
      toxins of gut microbiome origin, which can contribute to uremic symptoms, reduced quality of&#xD;
      life, and earlier progression to dialysis. The goal of this project is to investigate whether&#xD;
      the consumption of resistant potato starch (RPS) as an adjunctive therapy to current standard&#xD;
      of CKD care will reduce uremic toxins and symptoms by altering the gut microbiota in patients&#xD;
      with CKD.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Participants will consent to follow a 26-week study regimen. Participants will receive 2&#xD;
      sachets per day containing either 15 grams of RPS or 15 grams corn starch. The powder in the&#xD;
      sachets will be mixed in water and consumed, one sachet in the morning and one before bed.&#xD;
      Participants will be instructed to consume the investigational product at least 2 hours prior&#xD;
      to or after taking any medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the first two weeks, all participants will go through a run-in period, where they will&#xD;
      receive the corn starch. During weeks 3 to 12 (period 1) participants will receive either RPS&#xD;
      or cornstarch. The first treatment received will be determined by randomization procedures.&#xD;
      During weeks 13 to 16, all participants will undergo a washout period where they will consume&#xD;
      cornstarch. During weeks 17 and 26 (period 2), participants will receive the treatment they&#xD;
      did not previously consume.&#xD;
