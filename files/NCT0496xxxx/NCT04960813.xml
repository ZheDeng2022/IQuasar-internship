  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinically significant anxiety affects 20% of preschoolers and can become chronic, leading to&#xD;
      depression, substance abuse, school-drop out and even suicide. To reduce anxiety and prevent&#xD;
      its sequelae, clinically affected children must be effectively treated early. Available&#xD;
      interventions for clinically anxious preschoolers are effective for some, but not all&#xD;
      children, with as many as 50% of 4-7 year olds continuing to meet criteria for an anxiety&#xD;
      disorder after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial aims to help learn how Camp Kidpower, trainings using either structured games or a&#xD;
      playgroup, may lower anxiety in preschool age children. Playing these games and learning that&#xD;
      kids can do it, can teach kids how to keep going when they are feeling anxious. To find out&#xD;
      if Kidpower works by helping kids stay in charge of their behaviors and emotions, the study&#xD;
      will look at parts of the brain as well as behaviors related to effortful control and fear,&#xD;
      before and after training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesizes that Kidpower will produce greater increases in Error-related&#xD;
      negativity (ERN), Interchannel Phase Synchrony (ICPS) and effortful control (EC) behaviors&#xD;
      than in the Playgroup control.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Error Related Negativity (ERN)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment (baseline) and post-treatment assessments (approximately 4-6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The error-related negativity is a neurophysiological signal, measured via electroencephalogram (EEG), considered to reflect a dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) response to errors. For this study the ERN will be measured at electrode site FCz as the downward (negative voltage) deflection of the EEG signal that occurs 50-100 msec after error commission on the Zoo Task. Scores are measured continously (no established minimum or maximum) . Higher scores reflect greater neural capacity for effortful control.</description>

    <measure>Change in National Institutes of Health (NIH) Toolbox Effortful Control (EC) Composite Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment (baseline) and post-treatment assessments (approximately 4-6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The NIH Toolbox EC Composite Scale will be comprised of children's standardized scores reflecting accuracy and reaction time on two computerized tasks: the Flanker inhibitory control and attention task and the Dimensional Change Card Sort (DCCS) test of set-shifting function. An NIH Toolbox EC Composite score will be based on factor loadings for each task derived from a factor analysis of scores across both Toolbox tasks. Scores are measured continuously (no established minimum or maximum) . Higher scores reflect greater behavioral capacity for effortful control.</description>

    <measure>Change in Clinical Global Impressions -Severity and Improvement Scales</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment (baseline) and post-treatment assessments (approximately 4-6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) is an observer rated scale used to assess anxiety severity (CGI-S) and pre- to post-treatment improvement in anxiety (CGI-I). Ratings for both use a 7-point scale, from 1 &quot;normal&quot; to 7 &quot;among the most severely ill&quot; for CGI-S and 1 (&quot;very much improved&quot;) to 7 (&quot;very much worse&quot;) for CGI-I.</description>

    <measure>Change in Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule - Parent Version (ADIS-P)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment (baseline) and post-treatment assessments (approximately 4-6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>ADIS-P is a semi-structured clinical interview administered to parents to assess Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) diagnoses where anxiety is a component. Severity of symptoms is rated by interviewers on a scale from none (=0) to very severe (=8), with clinician severity rating (CSR) â‰¥ 4 indicating presence of diagnosis.. Changes in CSR of the primary (i.e., most severe at baseline) anxiety diagnosis from pre to post intervention will be assessed.</description>

    <measure>Change in Spence Preschool Anxiety Scale (Spence PAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment (baseline) up to post-treatment assessments (approximately 4-6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The Spence PAS is a validated instrument for the measurement of parent report of anxiety symptoms in young children. Spence PAS scores will provide a continuous rating of anxiety symptoms from 0 to 112; high scores reflect greater anxiety.</description>

    <description>Camp Kidpower - Structured Games is an interactive, child-friendly &quot;camp&quot; and is comprised of short, game-like exercises taught by &quot;camp counselors&quot; to groups of approximately 4-6 children. In total, 15 different exercises will be taught. Children will attend 5 three-hour playgroup sessions over a 4-week period (twice the first week, and then only once per week for the subsequent 3-week period) to match the Playgroup intervention.&#xD;
Parents will be asked to attend an approximately one-hour group meeting, during which information is presented regarding child anxiety, effortful control and the rationale for this treatment. Parents are asked to continue to utilize the intervention at home every day if possible with the child and will receive texts or emails to track the games that are played at home.</description>

    <description>Camp Kidpower - Playgroup includes structured play activities. This will include art activities, dramatic play props, and a &quot;story time&quot;. Children will attend 5 three-hour playgroup sessions over a 4-week period (twice the first week, and then only once per week for the subsequent 3-week period) to match the Kidpower intervention.&#xD;
During the first week parents will attend an approximately one-hour group meeting, during which information is presented regarding the positive benefits of child-led play and &quot;special time&quot; with caregivers.&#xD;
Parents well be asked to complete homework with their children during the week between sessions, and are shown how to track time spent in this activity. Parents will receive a daily text (or email) to to measure frequency of homework practice between sessions.</description>
