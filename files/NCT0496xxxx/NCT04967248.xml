  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-national, non-interventional study (NIS) collecting data from&#xD;
      postmenopausal women, and adult men, with HR+, HER2- locally advanced or metastatic breast&#xD;
      cancer whose tumor harbors a PIK3CA mutation, and who are treated with alpelisib in&#xD;
      combination with fulvestrant in the real-world setting.&#xD;

      Once the patient provides informed consent, he or she is enrolled in the study. Patients will&#xD;
      be followed from enrollment until 1) 30 days after alpelisib treatment discontinuation, or 2)&#xD;
      death, or 3) loss to follow-up, or 4) withdrawal of consent, or 5) physician decision to end&#xD;
      treatment/study, or 6) end of the study, whichever occurs first. The end of the study is&#xD;
      defined as a maximum of 12 months after the date the last patient was enrolled (LPFV); if the&#xD;
      last patient is still on treatment on that date, they will not be followed up any further&#xD;
