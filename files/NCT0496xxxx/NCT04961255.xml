  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The physiological/biomechanical characteristics related to muscle and tendon architecture and&#xD;
      their possible relationship with the loss of muscle strength and fatigue in patients who were&#xD;
      infected with COVID-19 are totally unknown. The aim of this study is to evaluate inflammatory&#xD;
      markers, the isometric maximum voluntary force of the knee extensor torque, muscle fatigue,&#xD;
      neuromuscular adaptations, muscle architecture, tendinous properties of quadriceps&#xD;
      components, oxygen extraction, and body composition in participants after diagnosis with&#xD;
      Covid-19 who had moderate and severe levels of involvement compared to a healthy control&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The groups will be composed of participants who had COVID-19, except for the control group,&#xD;
      which will be composed of healthy participants who did not have COVID-19. Participants will&#xD;
      be divided into: (1) control group, (2) COVID-19 positive participants who had moderate&#xD;
      symptoms, (3) COVID-19 positive participants who had severe symptoms. Participants will be&#xD;
      recruited from 21 days after the onset of symptoms, the period recommended by the scientific&#xD;
      community that the patient no longer transmits severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus&#xD;
      2 (SARS-CoV-2). After recruitment, 4 evaluations will be carried out over 1 year.&#xD;
