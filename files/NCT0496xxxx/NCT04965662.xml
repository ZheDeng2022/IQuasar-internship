  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is looking at a new way to reduce the risk of catching HIV. Post-exposure&#xD;
      Prophylaxis for sexual exposure (PEPSE) is where a month of HIV drugs can be given to reduce&#xD;
      the chance of getting HIV, after a risk. To improve its use the Investigators want to see&#xD;
      whether providing a 5-day course of PEPSE for people to keep at home (HOME PEPSE) will lead&#xD;
      to it being taken much quicker than having to get it from sexual health clinics or A&amp;E. The&#xD;
      HOME PEPSE packs contain HIV tablets that are used in routine HIV care. However the type of&#xD;
      HIV drugs are slightly different to those currently used in PEPSE and the Investigators hope&#xD;
      that they will have fewer side effects. HOME PEP consists of Truvada and Maraviroc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      140 gay men who are at high risk of getting HIV will be randomised to one of two groups.&#xD;
      Group A will receive HOME PEPSE immediately and group B will receive HOME PEPSE after 48&#xD;
      weeks on the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIV causes significant morbidity and the estimated lifetime cost of one HIV transmission is&#xD;
      Â£0.5-1 million. Despite enormous prevention efforts, transmission rates in the UK remain&#xD;
      stable. The population most at risk of acquiring HIV in the UK are men who have sex with men&#xD;
      (MSM), who are estimated to number over 500,000 (3.6% of the male population). The estimated&#xD;
      prevalence of HIV among MSM aged between 15 and 44 years old is approximately 5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2013 the highest ever number of new HIV diagnoses (3,000) among MSM was reported and 85%&#xD;
      of these were estimated to have been acquired in the UK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is supported by a concomitant increase in reported high risk behaviours such as&#xD;
      condomless anal sex, from 24.3% to 36.5% of the cohort surveyed in London gyms in 1998 and&#xD;
      2008 respectively. In London, approximately 80% MSM are HIV negative: however high-risk sex&#xD;
      continues in the presence of an increasing pool of HIV infected individuals. As such&#xD;
      effective HIV prevention interventions are urgently needed to keep such individuals&#xD;
      uninfected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite sustained education and public health messages high levels of condomless sex among&#xD;
      MSM are reported. HIV prevention tools include condoms, Post-Exposure Prophylaxis following&#xD;
      Sexual Exposure (PEPSE), HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), HIV testing to reduce the&#xD;
      undiagnosed fraction, antiretroviral treatment (ART) -as-prevention and circumcision.&#xD;
      Clinical trials are underway to evaluate the efficacy and cost effectiveness of these&#xD;
      approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PEPSE is a key component of HIV prevention. A prospective randomised-controlled trial to&#xD;
      determine the efficacy of PEPSE has been precluded due to the high number of participants&#xD;
      that would be required for such a study. A case-control study conducted in healthcare workers&#xD;
      suggested that the use of zidovudine (AZT) for post exposure prophylaxis after percutaneous&#xD;
      exposure to HIV-infected blood was associated with a significant (OR 0.19 (95% CI 0.06-0.52)&#xD;
      decrease in the risk of HIV transmission. In addition, mother to child transmission studies&#xD;
      where only the neonate received ART have demonstrated a protective effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy of PEPSE is dependent upon the following key factors:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Speed of uptake from sexual exposure :&#xD;
&#xD;
           The time from exposure to initiation of PEPSE is critical for efficacy. Once HIV crosses&#xD;
           a mucosal barrier it may take up to 48-72 hours before HIV can be detected within&#xD;
           regional lymph nodes and up to five days before HIV can be detected in blood. Initiation&#xD;
           of ART has been shown to reduce dissemination and replication of virus in all tissues if&#xD;
           initiated early after inoculation in an animal model.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Animal models mimicking sexual exposure either vaginally or rectally also show&#xD;
           protective benefits of the use of ART and demonstrate that time to initiation and&#xD;
           duration of PEPSE influence outcome of PEPSE, with delays and shorter courses reducing&#xD;
           effectiveness (Tsai J Virol 1998). For example, a phase I/II clinical trial using PMPA&#xD;
           (Tenofovir) administered subcutaneously for PEPSE demonstrated that simian&#xD;
           immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection was prevented following an intravenous&#xD;
           inoculation in 100% of macaques if administered within 24 hours and continued for 28&#xD;
           days. As either the time to initiation of PEP was increased or the duration of PEPSE was&#xD;
           reduced then the number of macaques protected declined.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Following rectal SIV challenge however, PEPSE offers no protection if taken &gt;24 hours&#xD;
           post exposure, with most protection occurring within a 2 hour exposure timeframe. This&#xD;
           is of enormous concern for those practicing unprotected receptive anal sex, which is the&#xD;
           highest risk sex act for HIV transmission. In the UK, the median time to first PEPSE&#xD;
           dose is 24 hours; this unsatisfactory duration has been attributed to the fact that most&#xD;
           exposures to HIV occur outside routine clinic hours and a lack of knowledge of where to&#xD;
           access PEPSE out-of-hours. Learning from the emergency contraception model women&#xD;
           provided with an advance provision of emergency contraception use it to a greater extent&#xD;
           and more rapidly after condomless vaginal sex without engaging in increased sexual&#xD;
           risk-taking behaviour compared to standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Uptake following sexual exposure. In the Gay Mens survey, 1.7% of gay men reported ever&#xD;
           using PEPSE despite 94% reporting at least one sexual partner sex in the preceding year.&#xD;
           Approaches to increase PEPSE uptake are therefore required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Adherence&#xD;
&#xD;
      The British Society for Sexual Health and HIV (BASHH) guidelines for PEPSE recommend Truvada&#xD;
      and Kaletra for 28 days and the indications for its use are shown in table 1. It is well&#xD;
      recognized that ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors including Kaletra are commonly&#xD;
      associated with gastrointestinal side effects and elevations in lipids (Kaletra Spc). Kaletra&#xD;
      inhibits cytochrome p450 CYP3A and therefore has many drug-drug interactions. Within the&#xD;
      ABT-730 study 37% patients experienced grade 3 or 4 adverse events and laboratory&#xD;
      abnormalities in the BD Kaletra arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As delayed initiation and non-completion of PEPSE due to side effect are likely to reduce&#xD;
      efficacy, it is important to explore regimens that is likely to be better tolerated and ways&#xD;
      in which PEPSE could be taken sooner after exposure. Maraviroc (MVC), a CCR5 antagonist has&#xD;
      been shown to be an effective antiretroviral agent in the MOTIVATE and MERIT studies. In&#xD;
      MERIT the percentage of patients achieving HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies/mL was comparable to those&#xD;
      receiving efavirenz where they had CCR5-tropic virus at baseline. Maraviroc does not inhibit&#xD;
      any of the major P450 enzymes at clinically relevant concentrations (CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8,&#xD;
      CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4). Maraviroc appears to have fewer drug-drug interactions&#xD;
      than Kaletra and the frequency of grade 3 or 4 adverse events was low (20%) in the MERIT&#xD;
      study. Maraviroc acts pre-integration which may have theoretical advantages for PEPSE/PrEP&#xD;
      against HIV. Animal data demonstrates that the use of a CCR5 inhibitor reduced the likelihood&#xD;
      of macaques acquiring SIV following vaginal exposure. Maraviroc has also been demonstrated to&#xD;
      penetrate the male and female genital tract well and achieve high rectal tissue&#xD;
      concentrations which may be beneficial for PEP or PrEP. In the event of failure of MVC based&#xD;
      PEPSE, it is unlikely treatment options will be affected. Maraviroc is given for HIV&#xD;
      treatment twice daily, however safety data supports once daily use and may confer advantages&#xD;
      in adherence. Trials evaluating the safety of Maraviroc (MVC) as PEPSE are currently underway&#xD;
      in the UK and Spain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, the cost of PEPSE is minimal in comparison to an HIV transmission and may provide&#xD;
      potential cost saving and adherence benefits over daily PrEP. The Investigators propose&#xD;
      reducing the time from HIV exposure to first dose of PEPSE in high risk individuals by&#xD;
      providing HOME PEPSE (a 5-day pack of PEPSE to be kept at home by the individual in case of&#xD;
      need). By removing traditional logistical barriers to PEPSE use, this approach aims to&#xD;
      improve the appropriate and immediate access of PEPSE, reduce attendance at A &amp; E, reduce&#xD;
      time to first dose (and hence increase efficacy) and further empower individuals to prevent&#xD;
      HIV acquisition. If a positive preventative effect is shown then this approach will be&#xD;
      evaluated in a large randomised controlled study, rolled out to other NHS providers and is&#xD;
      likely to lead to a revision of the UK PEPSE guidelines. Maraviroc lends itself well to&#xD;
      episodic, HOME provision PEPSE - it is stable over a long period of time, has fewer drug-drug&#xD;
      interactions than protease inhibitors and is well tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators hypothesize that advanced provision of PEPSE using Truvada/Maraviroc 600mg&#xD;
      OD, so called &quot;HOME&quot; PEPSE to high HIV risk individuals will improve the speed and&#xD;
      appropriate uptake of PEPSE and be extremely well tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      140 men who have sex with men and who are at high risk of getting HIV will be randomised to&#xD;
      one of two groups. Everyone will be seen at 12 weekly intervals for a sexual behaviour&#xD;
      questionnaire and sexual health screen. A more detailed questionnaire will be given at week 0&#xD;
      , week 48 and week 72.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A will receive HOME PEPSE immediately and finish the study at week 48. Anyone starting&#xD;
      HOME PEPSE will be advised to come to clinic as soon as possible to be assessed for the need&#xD;
      for a 28 day PEP course. As starting HOME PEPSE (or standard PEPSE for Arm B) is dependant on&#xD;
      participant risk behaviour, HOME PEPSE could not be taken at all during the trial or could be&#xD;
      taken multiple times. Therefore how many time certain standard of care/research procedures&#xD;
      occur during this trial, such as phlebotomy, is dependant on how many times participants take&#xD;
      PEPSE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B will receive HOME PEPSE after 48 weeks on the study and finish the study at week 72.&#xD;
      For the first 48 weeks, people in this group will be able to get PEPSE from the normal places&#xD;
      i.e. an A&amp;E department or a sexual health clinic. If people do start PEPSE they will be&#xD;
      advised to contact the research team so that they can record this and complete a short&#xD;
      questionnaire summarizing what happened.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 48 weeks, everyone will receive a HOME PEPSE pack and have a urine test and blood test to&#xD;
      test the kidneys and liver. They will then be followed up for a further 6 months.&#xD;
