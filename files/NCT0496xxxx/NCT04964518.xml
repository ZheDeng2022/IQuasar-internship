  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase Ib/II, open-label, multi-center study evaluating the safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      efficacy and PK of APG-2575 in combination with Azacitidine in the patients with AML/MPAL or&#xD;
      MDS/CMML. The study consists of dose escalation (Part I) and dose expansion phase (Part II)&#xD;

      The patients with histologically confirmed relapsed or refractory (R/R) AML/MPAL/CMML or&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory Higher-Risk MDS by WHO classification for which no available standard&#xD;
      therapies are indicated or anticipated to result in a durable response will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a 3+3 dose escalation to determine the DLTs and MTD/RP2D of APG-2575 (see dose&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with a diagnosis of histologically confirmed relapsed or refractory (R/R) acute&#xD;
        myeloid leukemia (AML) or mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL) or Chronic Myelomonocytic&#xD;
        Leukemia (CMML) or relapsed/refractory Higher-Risk MDS by 2016 WHO classification for which&#xD;
        no available standard therapies are indicated or anticipated to result in a durable&#xD;
        response.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  MPAL will include biphenotypic leukemia, bilineal leukemia, undifferentiated leukemia,&#xD;
             mixed lineage leukemia, leukemia of ambiguous lineage, T/myeloid leukemia, B/myeloid&#xD;
             leukemia, or other diagnosis indicating the presence of multiple lineages within the&#xD;
             cell population. Protocol code: APG2575AU101 APG-2575 Version 1.0/Jan 21, 2021 Page 9&#xD;
             of 93&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Relapsed/refractory MDS will be defined as prior receipt of 4 cycles of HMA therapy&#xD;
             with failure to attain a response, or progression of disease or relapse at any time&#xD;
             after prior response to HMA therapy with Overall Revised International Prognostic&#xD;
             Scoring System (IPSS-R) score &gt; 3 (intermediate, high or very high).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnant women. 2. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to active&#xD;

        leukemia therapy within 14 days prior to starting investigational drug.&#xD;
&#xD;

          -  Basal cell carcinoma of the skin or localized squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous malignancy confined and surgically resected (or treated with other&#xD;
             modalities) with curative intention requires discussion with sponsor. 14. Failure to&#xD;
             have recovered (Grade &gt; 1) from prior treatment (including chemotherapy, targeted&#xD;
             therapy, immunotherapy, experimental agents, radiation, or surgery), except for&#xD;
             alopecia. 15. Unable to swallow tablets or malabsorption syndrome, disease&#xD;
             significantly affecting gastrointestinal function, or resection of the stomach or&#xD;
             small bowel, symptomatic Protocol code: APG2575AU101 APG-2575 Version 1.0/Jan 21, 2021&#xD;

             including left bundle branch block, 2nd degree atrioventricular (AV) block type II,&#xD;
             3rd degree block, or corrected QT interval (QTc) â‰¥470 msec. 17. Any other condition or&#xD;
             circumstance that would, in the opinion of the investigator, make the patient&#xD;
             unsuitable for participation in the study. -&#xD;
