      Introduction: Elevated levels of androgen and insulin-resistant have been implicated in&#xD;
      recurrent miscarriage in women with PCOS. Published data are scarce on androgen level and&#xD;
      cervical length of women with and without PCOS and a history of miscarriage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate the levels of testosterone (TT), Sex Hormone&#xD;
      Binding Globulin (SHBG), Dehyroepiandrostenedione (DHEA) and cervical length in Egyptian&#xD;
      women with and without history PCOS and history of RM during pregnancy .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: Pregnant women with (n=38) and without (n=40) PCOS and history of recurrent&#xD;
      miscarriages were recruited from the Obstetrics Department, Alagoza Hospital, Cairo, Egypt.&#xD;
      Healthy pregnant women without PCOS and history of RM (n=40, HC) were also recruited. TT,&#xD;
      SHBG,DHEA and Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG) level and cervical length were assessed at&#xD;
      first, second and the third trimester or at the start of miscarriage&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recurrent miscarriage (RM )is defined as the loss of three of more consecutive pregnancies&#xD;
      before 20 weeks gestation (Royal College of Obstetricians &amp; Gynaecologists 2011, Practice&#xD;
      Committee of American Society for Reproductive Medicine 2013). The prevalence of RM varies&#xD;
      from country to country and within communities within the country. It tends to be higher in&#xD;
      developing countries. However it effects 1% to 2%of women (Jeve et al., 2014, Green-top&#xD;
      Guideline No. 17).Other studies have reported incidences of RM between 0.5% and 2.3 %&#xD;
      (Christiansen et al.,2007, Stirrat et al., 1990, Alberman et al., 1988).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently the established risk factors of RM include hormonal associated conditions&#xD;
      (Stephenson et al.,1996, Fox-Lee et al., 2007) , uterine abnormalities (including adhesions&#xD;
      post-surgery) (Rimbizis et al.,2001, Salim et al.,2003) anti-phospholipid syndrome Thrombotic&#xD;
      (Greer et al., 2003) , chromosomal and genetic (Braekeleer et al., 1990 , Clifford et&#xD;
      al.,1994, Stephenson et al., 2006, Franssen et al., 2006) conditions .Indeed some researchers&#xD;
      consider PCOS as a risk factor, However some don't.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 8% to 12% of RM is due to endocrine causes mainly due to hyperandrogenism and&#xD;
      hyperinsulinemia in PCOS (Smith et al., 2011, Witchel et al., 2019, Rai et al., 2000) .&#xD;
      Little research focuses directly on the effect of PCOS during gestation and how that can be&#xD;
      linked to poor pregnancy outcomes. However, there is a positive correlation between increased&#xD;
      risk of miscarriage and hyperhomocysteinemia in insulin resistant patients, a common&#xD;
      component of PCOS (Chakraborty et al.,2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current literature providing conflicting views on androgen levels effecting pregnancy in&#xD;
      PCOS patients some clarity is required as to whether its elevation impacts pregnancy. Not&#xD;
      only that, but the is limited published data which compared the androgen and cervical length&#xD;
      at different gestational periods of women with history of miscarriage either due to PCOS or&#xD;
      for unknown reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cervical cerclage (CC) is one of the management options offered to patient who has history of&#xD;
      midterm miscarriage. The efficacy of CC in management is still doubtable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim The aim of this study was to investigate the levels of testosterone (TT), Sex Hormone&#xD;
      Binding Globulin (SHBG), Dehyroepiandrostenedione (DHEA) and cervical length in women with&#xD;
      and without history PCOS and history of RM during pregnancy .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants of the study are women with (n=38) and without PCOS (n=40) and history of RM&#xD;
      were recruited during their first antenatal visit from Al-Agoza Hospital, Cairo, Egypt. They&#xD;
      were recruited during their first antenatal visit. Similarly pregnant women without PCOS&#xD;
      (n=40) with no history of RM were recruited. Detailed demographic, medical and obstetric&#xD;
      history was documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria for the study were women aged 23 to 40 years at the time of enrolment&#xD;
      into the study. The exclusion criteria for all participants included any other diagnosed&#xD;
      medical condition link with increased risk of miscarriage, including thyroid status and&#xD;
      gestational diabetes. All participants examined at the time of recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group were matched for age and BMI with no previous history of RM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was conducted in line with the human experimentation guidelines, dictated by the&#xD;
      Helsinki declaration. The procedures used were approved by local ethical committee and&#xD;
      conducted in line with the practices of Al-Agoza Hospital, Cairo, Egypt. All patients within&#xD;
      the study were briefed on the procedures and protocol that would take place and written&#xD;
      consent was obtained before induction into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confirmation of the pregnancy was made by beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin (Bhcg ) plus&#xD;
      ultrasound scan and clinical history in case of miscarriage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis for patients with recurrent miscarriage was in concordance with the guidelines&#xD;
      defined by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists; the loss of three or more&#xD;
      consecutive pregnancies (Royal College of Obstetricians &amp; Gynaecologists 2011 ).The diagnosis&#xD;
      of PCOS was based on Rotterdam 2003 Criteria (Rotterdam ESHRE/ASRM-Sponsored PCOS Consensus&#xD;
      Workshop Group 2004 ) which require two of the following; Oligo- or anovulation, Clinical&#xD;
      and/or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism or Polycystic ovaries and exclusion of other&#xD;
      related disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood Samples were collected by a professional trained in phlebotomy at the time points ;&#xD;
      first, second and the third trimester or at the start of miscarriage .Samples were analysed&#xD;
      for TT, SHBG,SHBG and DHEA using The ADVIA Centaur® XPT Immunoassay System - Siemens&#xD;
      (https://www.siemens-healthineers.com/en-uk/immunoassay/systems/advia-centaur-xpt#TECHNICAL_S&#xD;
      PECIFICATIONS).This system is easy to use where samples and reagents which could be loaded or&#xD;
      without pausing the system. Also it doesn't require daily set up procedure and implement new&#xD;
      assays immediately with one easy scan of a test definition bar code.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It requires 10-200 μL per test. it offers Automatic dilution varies by assay, up to 1:2500.&#xD;
      The reagent capacity on board is 30 assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similarly, cervical length was also measured at first, second and the third trimester or at&#xD;
      the start of miscarriage .It was measured via transvaginal ultrasound (Berghella et&#xD;
      al.,1997). The Voluson™ E8 ultrasound system is used for this study&#xD;
      (https://www.gehealthcare.com/products/ultrasound/voluson/voluson-e8 ). The data was recorded&#xD;
      by measuring the distance between the external os of the cervix and to where the cervix is&#xD;
      closed defined by the apex of the funnelling of the membranes (Berghella et al., 1997) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients within the RM groups attended cerclage treatment during the second trimester,&#xD;
      this included elective and emergency elective procedures. Patients presented at the time of&#xD;
      delivery or for recording of miscarriage where gestational age, gender of the fetus/baby and&#xD;
      whether it was a live birth was noted.&#xD;
