    <textblock>
      This is a a prospective cohort study. According to the inclusion criteria, volunteers were&#xD;
      recruited from patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty. The patients are devided into two&#xD;
      groups: the conventional TKA,the computer-assisted surgery(CAS) using Brainlab Knee 3&#xD;
      system.The differences of postoperative alignment,operative time,blood loss will be studied&#xD;
      between the two groups.Clinical and functional evaluation using the scoring system of&#xD;
      HSS(Hospital for Special Surgery) score, Western Ontario and McMaster University&#xD;
      osteoarthritis index (WOMAC), Forgotten joint score(FJS-12) will be compared between the 2&#xD;
      groups,after surgery, and at the follow-up of 3 months、6 months and 12 months.&#xD;

      According to the inclusion criteria, patients receiving primary total knee arthroplasty were&#xD;
      recruited and divided into two groups after doctor-patient joint decision: the traditional&#xD;
      group underwent prosthesis placement using traditional intramedullary positioning method;The&#xD;
      navigation group performed surgery using the Brainlab Knee 3 navigation system.Informed&#xD;
      consent was signed after grouping. All patients were operated by the same knee prosthesis&#xD;
      system. Both groups underwent the same procedures such as the installation of the soft tissue&#xD;
      adjustment, prosthesis placement, wound closure and so on.All patients were given the same&#xD;
      perioperative treatment, such as hemostasis, anti-infection and analgesia, and routine&#xD;
      postoperative rehabilitation exercises. The full length anteroposterior and lateral&#xD;
      radiographs of both lower extremities in weight-bearing position were taken preoperatively&#xD;
      and one week postoperatively.The differences of postoperative alignment,operative time,blood&#xD;
      loss will be studied between the two groups.Clinical and functional evaluation using the&#xD;
      scoring system of HSS(Hospital for Special Surgery) score, Western Ontario and McMaster&#xD;
      University osteoarthritis index (WOMAC), Forgotten joint score(FJS-12) will be compared&#xD;
      between the 2 groups,after surgery, and at the follow-up of 3 months、6 months and 12 months.&#xD;

    <description>The WOMAC is a self administered questionnaire to assess joint function and quality of life for patients with osteoarthritis; it consists of 24 items: pain (5 items), stiffness (2 items), and physical function (17 items). The higher the total score, the worse the patient's pain, stiffness, and functional limitations. The WOMAC is validated for various languages, including Chinese.</description>

    <description>HSS(hospital for special surgery) score HSS(hospital for special surgery) score to evaluate patients postoperative knee joint function. With a total of 100, it has 7 subscales: 1.Pain 0~30; 2. Function 0~22; 3. Mobility 0~18; 4. Flexion deformity 0~10; 6. Stability 0~10; 7. Deduction Item. For each scale, a higher value represents a better outcome. The sum of the subscales is the total score.</description>

    <measure>Forgotten Joint Score-12 (FJS-12)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months and 12 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The FJS-12 is a PROM for patients who have undergone a TKA; it introduces the concept of a &quot;forgotten&quot; joint as the ideal objective to pursue in prosthetic surgery. It is composed of 12 items, measuring the patient's ability to forget the presence of an artificial joint in their daily life. For each item, there is a five-points Likert scale response. The raw results are converted to a 0-100 points scale. Highest score corresponds to good outcome with the patient not aware about the presence of the prosthesis. In the case of more than 4 answers are missing, the score should not be used .</description>
