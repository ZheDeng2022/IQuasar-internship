      This study will evaluate the effectiveness and safety of intravenous injection of RC48-ADC in&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is an open, multi-cohort, multi-center Phase II basket clinical study that&#xD;
      included HER2 expression (HER2 positive and HER2 low expression) gynecological malignant&#xD;
      tumor subjects. The four cohorts include cervical cancer, ovarian epithelial cancer、&#xD;
      fallopian tube cancer and primary peritoneal cancer, endometrial cancer and other&#xD;
      gynecological malignancies (vulvar cancer, vaginal cancer, primary sarcoma of the&#xD;
      gynecological reproductive system, etc.). Each cohort enrolled 30 subjects. Among them, IHC+,&#xD;
      IHC2+, IHC3+ subjects were enrolled at least 5 subjects, and the remaining 15 subjects were&#xD;
      not restricted by HER2 expression. HER2 expression includes HER2 positive and HER2 low&#xD;
      expression. HER2 positive is defined by the immunohistochemical IHC 2+/fluorescence in situ&#xD;
      hybridization technique FISH+ or IHC 3+ judged by the central laboratory. HER2 low expression&#xD;
      is defined as IHC 2+/FISH- or IHC+ as determined by the central laboratory. The Molecular&#xD;
      Pathology Department of the Department of Pathology, Cancer Hospital of the Chinese Academy&#xD;
      of Medical Sciences will serve as the research center laboratory to confirm the HER2 status&#xD;
      (including IHC and FISH tests).&#xD;
