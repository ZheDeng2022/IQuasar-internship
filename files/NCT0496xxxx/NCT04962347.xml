  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Real world data are needed on remdesivir (RDV) efficacy in COVID-19, especially in the&#xD;
      underserved populations of the United States (U.S.) Gulf Coast as initial clinical trials may&#xD;
      not be representative of this population. Specifically, regions such as New Orleans are 60%&#xD;
      African American, a much greater proportion of African Americans than initial RDV studies.&#xD;
      The main hypothesis is that a real world data based study will provide specific information&#xD;
      related to RDV efficacy in COVID-19 patients from underserved / underrepresented populations&#xD;
      of the U.S. Gulf Coast. The main goal of this study is to provide population-centered&#xD;
      information related on RDV related to indication (stage of disease), dosing, monitoring,&#xD;
      efficacy and contraindications for future COVID-19 patients in this underserved region.&#xD;

      This study involves extracting data from 10,000 patients with Polymerase Chain Reaction&#xD;
      (qPCR) confirmed COVID-19 infection through electronic-charts of Tulane Medical Center and&#xD;
      University Medical Center (New Orleans, Louisiana) and Doctors Hospital at Renaissance (DHR)&#xD;
      system (Texas). According to the inclusion criteria below and spanning from September 2019 -&#xD;
      December 2021 we predict to include 1500 RDV treated patients and 8500 non-treated&#xD;
      comparators, all with COVID-19, through the Research Action for Health Network (REACHnet)&#xD;
      (link: https://eco.reachnet.org) in partnership with the Louisiana Public Health Institute&#xD;
      (LPHI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following anonymized data extraction, propensity score will be used to compare primary and&#xD;
      secondary endpoints between matched COVID-19 infected patients who received RDV to those who&#xD;
      did not receive RDV. Patients of both cohorts will be stratified by severity. Moderate and&#xD;
      severe respiratory distress associated with COVID-19 are defined as per US-GS-540-5773 and&#xD;
      US-GS-540-5774 clinical trials. Through the investigator's extensive Electronic Medical&#xD;
      Record (EMR) data collection network including diverse underserved populations of the U.S.&#xD;
      Gulf South, they will evaluate real world outcomes of RDV treatment for COVID-19. The 2&#xD;
      cohorts will be compared with focus upon respiratory distress evolution, co-morbidities and&#xD;
      other illness associated/relevant to COVID-19 course during admission, post-discharge during&#xD;
      convalescent period of up to 6 months, and documentation of pre-admission comorbidities in&#xD;
      the 6 months pre-admit.&#xD;
