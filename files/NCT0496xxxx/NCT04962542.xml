  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pulmonary dysfunction (PPD) is a widely reported complication of&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) although there is improvement in perioperative management, that&#xD;
      leads to increased morbidity and mortality in cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many surgical-related factors can predispose to postoperative pulmonary complications such as&#xD;
      the effects of general anesthesia combined with the effects of a median sternotomy, CPB, and&#xD;
      the use of topical cooling for myocardial protection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main clinical manifestations of PPD include atelectasis, pleural effusion, and postoperative&#xD;
      hypoxemia without clinical symptoms in addition to acute respiratory distress syndrome which&#xD;
      is rare to happen but leads to high mortality Different strategies including perioperative&#xD;
      management of mechanical ventilation (MV), restrictive transfusion, technical modifications&#xD;
      of CPB, and medication administration such as steroids and aprotinin have been developed to&#xD;
      lessen impairment of pulmonary function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent meta-analysis identified improvement in oxygenation after weaning from CPB when low&#xD;
      tidal volume (LTV) ventilation was maintained or after lung recruitment maneuvers (LRM), as&#xD;
      compared to when there was no ventilation (noV). Also, maintaining mechanical ventilation may&#xD;
      reduce the inflammation response and tissue damage. So far, available researches regarding&#xD;
      whether ventilation during CPB could improve respiratory outcomes is still controversial&#xD;
      especially in pediatric patients undergoing corrective surgeries for congenital heart&#xD;
      defects.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Our study is designed to determine the effect of different strategies of ventilation during&#xD;
      CPB on arterial oxygenation and PPD in pediatrics undergoing corrective cardiac surgeries for&#xD;
      non-cyanotic congenital anomalies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative:&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, a proper and detailed history from the parents will be taken followed by a full and&#xD;
      detailed examination of the child then the investigators will check all investigations&#xD;
      including complete blood count(CBC), coagulation profile, liver enzymes, kidney function&#xD;
      tests, chest X-ray (CXR), echocardiography, and blood grouping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be premedicated with atropine 0.01 mg/kg, and midazolam 0.02 mg/kg&#xD;
      intramuscular(IM), 30 minutes before induction of anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative:&#xD;
&#xD;
      the investigators will start with Standard Monitoring as ECG, Pulse oximetry, and&#xD;
      non-invasive blood pressure. Then the investigators will proceed to induction using&#xD;
      sevoflurane in 50% FiO2 followed by Placement of peripheral IV cannula and IV administration&#xD;
      of fentanyl (2 µg/kg) and cisatracurium 0.1 mg/kg then Oral endotracheal intubation and the&#xD;
      Capnogram will be connected to monitor End-tidal carbon dioxide(CO2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be mechanically ventilated using pressure-controlled mode with a fraction of&#xD;
      inspired oxygen(FiO2) 50%, Inspiration to expiration time ratio of 1:2, peak inspiratory&#xD;
      pressure (PIP), and respiratory rate will be set according to the age to maintain the range&#xD;
      of end-tidal carbon dioxide pressure at 35-45 mmHg in all groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintenance of anesthesia will be achieved using sevoflurane 2 % in 1:1 oxygen: air,&#xD;
      cisatracurium infusion 1-2 mcg/kg/min and Fentanyl 1-5 µg/kg till the time of CPB (1 µg/kg&#xD;
      before skin incision,2 µg/kg before sternotomy,2 µg/kg during cannulation) Advanced&#xD;
      monitoring where nasopharyngeal temperature probe will be placed, a Central venous catheter&#xD;
      to monitor central venous pressure(CVP), and Arterial cannula to monitor invasive blood&#xD;
      pressure, then antibiotic will be given after skin test, Standard CPB technique will be used&#xD;
      in all patients. Before aortic cannulation, patients will receive IV heparin 300-400 U.kg-1&#xD;
      aiming to produce activated clotting time (ACT) value &gt; 400 sec. A membrane oxygenator&#xD;
      (minimax plus; Medtronic's Inc., Anaheim, CA) will be used during CPB. Priming solution in&#xD;
      the form of isotonic saline solution supplemented with heparin will be added to fresh whole&#xD;
      blood in appropriate amounts to achieve a hematocrit of 20-25% during CPB. Furosemide in a&#xD;
      dose of 1 mg/kg will be given to all patients. Anesthesia during CPB will be given by&#xD;
      Sevoflurane administrated via a vaporizer inserted into the oxygenator gas supply with a&#xD;
      constant gas flow of 3 liters/min. A non-pulsatile roller pump (model10.10.00; Stockett&#xD;
      instruments; Munich, Germany) will be used and the pump flow will be adjusted at 2.4 to 2.6&#xD;
      L/min /m2 during the normothermic period targeting mean arterial blood pressure between 40&#xD;
      and 60 mmHg, Alpha-stat pH management was used and replacement fluids were added as blood&#xD;
      (packed red cells), colloid or crystalloid as indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After application of aortic cross-clamp, cold blood cardioplegia (20 mL/kg for initial dose)&#xD;
      with 30 milliequivalent(mEq)/L of potassium, sodium bicarbonate 25 mEq/L, Xylocaine 120 mg/L&#xD;
      will be injected into the aortic root, also topical myocardial cooling will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During CPB the patients enrolled in the study will be randomly assigned to three groups using&#xD;
      a computer-generated random sequence of numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group A (n=20) the lungs will be kept inflated by delivery of oxygen: air 3 liters/min&#xD;
           with FiO2 50% pressure-controlled mode, respiratory rate(RR) 20-30/min according to age,&#xD;
           PIP will be adjusted to keep Vt 2 mL/kg as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group B (n=20) their lungs will be kept inflated by delivery of oxygen: air 3 liters/min&#xD;
           with FiO2 50% and continuous positive airway pressure(CPAP) will be maintained via a&#xD;
           circle system with airway pressure maintained at 5 cmH2O by positive end expiratory&#xD;
           pressure(PEEP) valve. This will be verified by a previously calibrated, in-circuit&#xD;
           Bourdon gauge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group C (control group) (n=20) their lungs will be deflated by disconnecting the&#xD;
           breathing circuit from the ventilator (passive deflation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post CPB, the patient will be mechanically ventilated using pressure-controlled mode with&#xD;
      FiO2 50%, Inspiration to expiration time ratio of 1:2, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), and&#xD;
      respiratory rate will be set according to the age to maintain the range of end-tidal carbon&#xD;
      dioxide pressure at 35-45 mmHg in all groups.&#xD;
