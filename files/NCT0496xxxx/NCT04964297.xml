  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Undetected bowel perforation is a rare but dangerous complication of laparoscopic surgery. If&#xD;
      the injury is not detected and treated at the time of the surgical procedure, the patient can&#xD;
      suffer severe complications, including septic shock and eventually death. The investigator's&#xD;
      goal is to test a novel device that can detect bowel gas leakage from perforation and alert&#xD;
      the surgeon during the operation by evaluating the gases present in the insufflated abdomen&#xD;
      during surgery. This study will determine the ability of the device to be attached to a&#xD;
      standard trocar during the operation and periodically draw small samples or aliquots of gas&#xD;
      from the abdomen to evaluate the gas and accurately detect gaseous content from the bowel.&#xD;
      Before the device can be used to detect bowel perforations, the investigators must first&#xD;
      ensure that it can accurately detect bowel gas in an insufflated abdomen.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to test a novel device that can detect bowel gas leakage from&#xD;
      perforation and alert the surgeon during the operation by evaluating the gases present in the&#xD;
      insufflated abdomen during surgery. During laparoscopic surgery, CO2 is inserted into the&#xD;
      abdominal cavity in order to perform the operation. This is a dynamic process as insufflation&#xD;
      is constant during the entire procedure to maintain constant pressure and compensate for any&#xD;
      small leaks due to the insertion and retrieval of instruments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will determine the ability of a novel device to be attached to a standard trocar&#xD;
      during the operation and periodically draw a small amount of gas from the abdomen to evaluate&#xD;
      the gas and accurately detect gaseous content from the bowel. Before the device can be used&#xD;
      to detect bowel perforations, first the investigators must ensure that it can accurately&#xD;
      detect bowel gas in an insufflated abdomen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigational device, Perf-AlertTM, consists of a 15&quot; x 13&quot; x 7&quot; unit containing gas&#xD;
      sensors and valves, a small box containing a one way, ultra-low pressure pump, user controls&#xD;
      (buttons), and software algorithms, which control the operation of the device ( Image1). It&#xD;
      is used in conjunction with a single-use, disposable kit consisting of sterile tubing and&#xD;
      filters used for sample collection and transport (Image 2). The sensing unit will be&#xD;
      connected via a sterile tube/filter set to any trocar port in use during the procedure. At&#xD;
      specific time points during the procedure, a one-way valve will be opened and the unit's pump&#xD;
      turned on pulling small aliquots of gas from the abdominal cavity to the sensing unit. The&#xD;
      system's architecture is configured such that sample collection, transport, analysis, and&#xD;
      feedback occur in a single step such that sample collection and sensor feedback occur in&#xD;
      real-time. A standard laptop running an analytical software program is connected to the unit&#xD;
      to record and log sensor readings. No changes to the device are anticipated during the course&#xD;
      of the study.&#xD;
