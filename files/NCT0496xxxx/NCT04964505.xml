    <textblock>
      This phase I trial evaluates the side effects of uproleselan, azacitidine, and venetoclax in&#xD;
      treating older or unfit patients with treatment naive acute myeloid leukemia. Uproleselan may&#xD;
      help block the formation of growths that may become cancer. Chemotherapy drugs, such as&#xD;
      azacitidine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the&#xD;
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Venetoclax may&#xD;
      stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking Bcl-2, a protein needed for cancer cell survival.&#xD;
      Giving uproleselan with azacitidine and venetoclax may help kill more cancer cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of uproleselan combined with azacitidine and&#xD;
      venetoclax in older or unfit patients with treatment naive acute myeloid leukemia (AML).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the preliminary efficacy of uproleselan combined with azacitidine and&#xD;
      venetoclax in older or unfit patients with treatment naive AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive uproleselan intravenously (IV) over 1 hour every 12 hours (Q12H) on days&#xD;
      1-7, azacitidine IV or subcutaneously (SC) once daily (QD) on days 1-7, and venetoclax orally&#xD;
      (PO) QD on days 1-28. Beginning cycle 5, patients achieving morphologic leukemia-free state&#xD;
      (MLFS) or better response, may receive azacitidine IV or SC QD and uproleselan IV over 1 hour&#xD;
      QD on days 1-6 and 8 or days 1-5 and 8-9 or days 1-5. Treatment with uproleselan repeats&#xD;
      every 28 days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. Cycles with azacitidine and venetoclax repeat every 28 days in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression and unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, and then every 3&#xD;
      months for 1 year.&#xD;
