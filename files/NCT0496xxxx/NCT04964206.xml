  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      How perinatal factors affect the long-term development of children has always been an issue&#xD;
      of much concern. This study is designed to explore the potential impact of maternal neuraxial&#xD;
      labor analgesia exposure on offspring neurodevelopment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuraxial labor analgesia, including epidural analgesia and combined spinal-epidural&#xD;
      analgesia, is a well-established technique to alleviate labor pain. It can help to reduce the&#xD;
      maternal stress response during labor and might be associated with a lower risk of maternal&#xD;
      postpartum depression; which may be beneficial to the long-term neurodevelopment in&#xD;
      offspring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, neuraxial labor analgesia is associated with increased risks of&#xD;
      intrapartum maternal fever and instrumental delivery, which may produce potentially harmful&#xD;
      effects. In addition, it has been reported that the anesthetic exposure during neuraxial&#xD;
      analgesia may lead to fetal-neonatal depression and even neurotoxic effects of less mature&#xD;
      neonatal brain. Taking all these into account, the potential long-term effects of neuraxial&#xD;
      analgesia on offspring neurodevelopment is still controversial and deserves further study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of study is to investigate if there is any association between maternal&#xD;
      neuraxial analgesia exposure during labor and risk of offspring neurodevelopment delay at 2&#xD;
      years of age.&#xD;

    <description>Developmental screening is performed with the Chinese version Ages and Stages Questionnaires-Third Edition (ASQ-C). The ASQ-C contains five major developmental domains (communication, gross motor, fine motor, problem solving and personal-social skills); each domain consists six questions. The score on each of the six questions is summed to obtain an ASQ-C domain score. The score on each domain is summed to obtain an ASQ-C total score. A total score of less than two standard deviations from the mean of the Chinese reference group is considered as developmental delay.</description>
