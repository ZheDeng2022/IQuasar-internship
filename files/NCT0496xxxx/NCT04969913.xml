      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Half of the world s population is at risk of malaria. In 2015, there were 214 million cases&#xD;
      of malaria and 438,000 deaths. A transmission-blocking vaccine (TBV) could help end the&#xD;
      disease. Improved tests are needed to measure how well the vaccines work. Researchers want to&#xD;
      collect data about malaria infection as the first step in testing a TBV in rural Guinea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study community dynamics of malaria transmission by estimating the rate of blood smear&#xD;
      positive people by month and season.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People 6 months of age and older who live in Maf(SqrRoot)(Registered Trademark)rinyah&#xD;
      sub-prefecture and plan to remain during the study. Households with at least 3 people who are&#xD;
      eligible to take part in the study are also needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a medical and medicine history. They will have a physical&#xD;
      exam. Their height and weight will be measured. Their vital signs may be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a study visit each month for up to 3 years. They will get a study ID.&#xD;
      They will be asked about any symptoms of malaria or changes in health. They will give blood&#xD;
      samples. They may have a physical exam. Within 3 days of the study visits, live and dead&#xD;
      mosquitoes may be gathered in and around their home. Insecticide spray will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants can visit the clinic at any time if they feel ill. If they have malaria, they&#xD;
      will be treated according to Guinea National Malaria Control Guidelines for adults and&#xD;
      children.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A vaccine that interrupts malaria transmission is critical to eradicate the disease, but&#xD;
      improved assays are needed to measure the efficacy of vaccines. Transmission-blocking&#xD;
      vaccines (TBVs) work by inducing antibodies that inhibit parasite development in the mosquito&#xD;
      interrupting transmission. Efficacy of vaccines may be estimated by in vitro membrane feeding&#xD;
      assays using immune sera&#xD;
&#xD;
      and laboratory mosquitoes, but qualified assays that measure transmission in the field are&#xD;
      needed to assess transmission-blocking interventions in natura.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical trials of TBVs have started elsewhere on the continent in Mali, and we expect to&#xD;
      expand TBV studies in Guinea in the near future. This protocol will use a longitudinal cohort&#xD;
      to gather information of malaria transmission based on the rates of blood smear positive&#xD;
      individuals by month, season and year in at Maferinyah sub-prefecture, Guinea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals in the villages will be approached first for participation, including permission&#xD;
      to contact their household and neighbors of their compound for participation. Households will&#xD;
      be identified using census data and individuals will be consented for participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Malaria smears will be obtained at monthly visits, in conjunction with mosquito collections&#xD;
      in/around village residences. Parasite infection rates in locally caught mosquitoes will be&#xD;
      assessed longitudinally for differences by season and year. A total of 400 volunteers from&#xD;
      Maferinyah will be enrolled. Participants will be followed for up to 3 years, to collect data&#xD;
      that will guide the design of future community-based trials of TBV.&#xD;
