  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 clinical trial studying whether or not oxaloacetate has a positive effect&#xD;
      on patients with Myasthenia Gravis. Patients will be assigned to one of three cohorts which&#xD;
      will determine the dose of oxaloacetate they will be given. Subjects will take the study drug&#xD;
      for 4 weeks and be on placebo for 4 weeks.&#xD;

    <description>Myasthenia Gravis-specific Activities of Daily Living scale (MG-ADL): Composite measure of scores from measurement scales. The MG-ADL has a scale of 0 - 24 with 0 being the lowest (no symptoms) and 24 being the highest (most severe symptoms. The MG-ADL is a staff-administered, patient-reported questionnaire that measures 8 commons symptoms of myasthenia gravis and grades them on a scale of 0 - 3.</description>

    <measure>Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Week 4 to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The QMG is a 13 item ordinal scale which measures ocular, bulbar, extremity fatigue and strength, along with respiratory function. The scale is from 0 - 3 for each item, with 0 meaning normal and 3 is severe. Total score can range from 0 to 39.</description>

    <description>Oxaloacetate (OAA) is a four-carbon molecule involved in many metabolic pathways, including gluconeogenesis, citric acid cycle, glyoxylate cycle, urea cycle, and amino acid metabolism. In the glyoxylate and citric acid cycles, oxaloacetate is formed as the result of the catalysis by malate dehydrogenase.&#xD;
Subjects will take either 500mg BID, 1000mg BID, or 2000mg BID each day for 4 weeks, depending on which cohort they are assigned to.</description>

    <description>Oxaloacetate (OAA) is a four-carbon molecule involved in many metabolic pathways, including gluconeogenesis, citric acid cycle, glyoxylate cycle, urea cycle, and amino acid metabolism. In the glyoxylate and citric acid cycles, oxaloacetate is formed as the result of the catalysis by malate dehydrogenase. In this reaction, the hydrogen atoms from malate are transferred to NAD+, forming NADH, H+ and oxaloacetate. Oxaloacetate can be converted to citrate with the addition of acetyl-CoA by the enzyme citrate synthase. Oxaloacetate is a critical component in the production of ATP and must be constantly regenerated in order for the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain to continue</description>

          1. Patients 18 and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must have prior or current documentation of MGFA MG grades 2, 3, or 4A&#xD;
             generalized MG, according to the MGFA classification system. These grades correspond&#xD;
             to mild (2), moderate (3), and severe (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient's signs and symptoms should not be better explained by another disease&#xD;
             process.&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. Patients must be willing to give written informed consent before participating in this&#xD;
             study. A copy of the signed consent must be kept in the patient's medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients can be on the following drugs as long as there has been no dose change for 60&#xD;
             days: azathioprine, cyclosporine, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus,&#xD;
             methotrexate, IVIg or other immunosuppressive drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients can be on prednisone as long as there has been no dose change for 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. No planned changes in MG medications during the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. A history of chronic degenerative, severe psychiatric, or neurologic disorder other&#xD;
             than MG that can produce weakness or fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Other major chronic or debilitating illnesses within six months prior to study entry.&#xD;
