        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female, ages 18 years and greater.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior to&#xD;
             receiving the study drug and will agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or&#xD;
             barrier method or abstinence) from the time of screening to a period of 1 year&#xD;
             following completion of the drug treatment cycle. Females of childbearing potential&#xD;
             are defined as premenopausal and not surgically sterilized, or post-menopausal for&#xD;
             fewer than 2 years. A urine pregnancy test will be performed prior to the&#xD;
             administration of the study drug to confirm negative results. If the urine pregnancy&#xD;
             test is positive, the study drug will not be administered and the result will be&#xD;
             confirmed by a serum pregnancy test. Serum pregnancy tests will be performed at a&#xD;
             central clinical laboratory, whereas urine pregnancy tests will be performed by&#xD;
             qualified personnel using kit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females becoming pregnant during the study will continue to be monitored for the&#xD;
             duration of the study or completion of the pregnancy, whichever is longer. Monitoring&#xD;
             will include perinatal and neonatal outcome. Any SAEs associated with pregnancy will&#xD;
             be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of Lichen Sclerosus.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  On a maintenance regimen of topical clobetasol for Lichen Sclerosus. Maintenance is&#xD;
             defined as use of topical clobetasol 3 or fewer days per week. For patients with a new&#xD;
             diagnosis of Lichen Sclerosus, they will complete 6 weeks of topical clobetasol&#xD;
             ointment twice daily prior to enrollment in the study with transition to a maintenance&#xD;
             regimen during study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Completed general physical evaluation with primary care provider within 12 months of&#xD;
             enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Full understanding of the requirements of the study and willingness to comply with&#xD;
             protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Can provide written informed consent and complete HIPAA documentation after the nature&#xD;
             of the study is fully explained and prior to any study-related procedure&#xD;
&#xD;

          -  Taking anticoagulant medications (e.g., warfarin, heparin) or clopidogrel (Plavix).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Taking anti-rheumatic disease medication (including methotrexate or other&#xD;
             antimetabolites) within 3 months prior to study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  On chronic, immunosuppressive transplant therapy or having a chronic,&#xD;
             immunosuppressive state, including use of systemic steroids/corticosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Using topical steroids on affected area and unable to stop for the 6 week washout&#xD;
             period prior to beginning the study. Topical steroid use will be exclusionary&#xD;
             throughout week 12 of the study for patients randomized to receive PRP.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current tobacco product use, including nicotine patch or other nicotine products.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ongoing infectious disease, including but not limited to tuberculosis, HIV, hepatitis,&#xD;

          -  Clinically significant cardiovascular (e.g., history of myocardial infarction,&#xD;
             congestive heart failure or uncontrolled hypertension &gt; 90 mmHg diastolic and/or 180&#xD;
             mmHg systolic), neurologic (e.g., stroke, TIA) renal, hepatic, or endocrine disease&#xD;
             (e.g., diabetes).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of cancer/malignancy with the exception of adequately treated basal cell or&#xD;
             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin within the last 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of blood dyscrasia, including but not limited to anemia, thrombocytopenia, and&#xD;
             monoclonal gammopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in a study of an experimental drug or medical device within 3 months of&#xD;
             study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known allergy to local anesthetics of other components of the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of or current evidence of alcohol or drug abuse or dependence, recreational&#xD;
             use of illicit drug or prescription medications, or have use of medical marijuana&#xD;
             within 30 days of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any illness or condition which, in the investigators' judgement will interfere with&#xD;
             the patient's ability to comply with the protocol, compromise patient safety, or&#xD;
             interfere with the interpretation of the study results.&#xD;
