    <textblock>
      This study aims to use novel proton-based MRI techniques to assess lung function and&#xD;
      structure in healthy volunteers and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&#xD;
      (COPD) and alpha-1-anti-trypsin deficiency (A1ATD). These novel MRI measures will be compared&#xD;
      to matched contemporary clinical diagnostic tools, namely pulmonary function tests (PFTs) and&#xD;
      computed tomography (CT) scans. MRI has the advantages of avoiding ionising radiation&#xD;
      exposure (unlike CT scans) and can also provide regional measures of lung function (unlike&#xD;
      PFTs which provide global measures of function). In addition, these MRI techniques do not&#xD;
      require the use of any inhaled or injected contrast agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some patients enrolled in this study will be undergoing a lung volume reduction (LVR)&#xD;
      procedure as part of their normal clinical care. LVR is an intervention for patients with&#xD;
      severe lung disease and hyperinflation. It is a palliative therapy that helps to reduce lung&#xD;
      hyperinflation through insertion of small valves in the airway or surgical removal of parts&#xD;
      of the lung. This can lead to improvements in symptoms such as breathlessness and improve&#xD;
      exercise tolerance due to better functioning of the lung. In this study, we will explore how&#xD;
      lung MRI measures can be used to assess patients before and after an LVR intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will take place at the University of Nottingham in collaboration with Nottingham&#xD;
      University Hospitals NHS Trust. The study will last for 3 years and participants will be&#xD;
      asked to attend a screening visit (lasting up to 1 hour) and either one or two study visits&#xD;
      (each lasting up to 3 hours).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single centre pilot study. The research team aims to recruit adult healthy&#xD;
      volunteers and adult patient volunteers with COPD and A1ATD. We have used similar&#xD;
      proton-based MRI techniques in healthy volunteers and people with other lung diseases and the&#xD;
      MRI scans have been well tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be adults (both male and female) who can give informed consent and are&#xD;
      able to undertake the study procedures. Potential participants who cannot have an MRI scan&#xD;
      for safety reasons (e.g. have a pacemaker) will not be recruited. During study visits, all&#xD;
      research activities will be observed by a member of the research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the screening visit (following consent), the following information and measures will&#xD;
      be taken:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevant past medical history, COPD assessment tool (questionnaire), height, weight, blood&#xD;
      pressure and pulse oximetry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During study visits, a combination of structural and functional lung MRI scans will be&#xD;
      performed with the participant lying in the scanner. Participants will be asked to breathe&#xD;
      normally during scans and may also be asked to perform breathing manoeuvres such as holding&#xD;
      their breath temporarily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be assigned unique codes, and their data will be anonymised.&#xD;
      Participants' medical reports will only be accessed for study purposes and will be treated as&#xD;
      confidential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will aim to use the data to plan future studies, and the data from this&#xD;
      study may contribute to publications and presentations. Participants will not be identified&#xD;
      in any publications arising from the research. The data obtained will be published without&#xD;
      any identifying information.&#xD;
