  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous work by the study group convinced the study team to pursue development of focused&#xD;
      cognitive reappraisal training as a novel approach to treatment of BPD, either as stand-alone&#xD;
      treatment or in concert with evidence-based treatments of BPD. The present proposal aims to&#xD;
      refine and test a proposed clinical intervention for BPD patients, training in&#xD;
      reappraisal-by-distancing, in terms of its ability to influence hypothesized neural and&#xD;
      behavioral targets and, once that is established, to demonstrate its ability improve&#xD;
      clinically relevant outcome measures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is a prevalent, enduring and disabling psychiatric&#xD;
      condition found in approximately 2% to 5.9% of the population and 20% of hospitalized&#xD;
      psychiatric patients. Suicide rates of approximately 10% have been reported. One of the most&#xD;
      prominent clinical features of BPD is extreme mood shifts occurring in response to external&#xD;
      social/emotional events. The emotional instability in BPD contributes to many of the most&#xD;
      disabling, even life-threatening, symptoms of the disorder, including suicidality, outbursts&#xD;
      of intense anger, and seriously impaired role functioning. The severity of the BPD symptom&#xD;
      profile, its prevalence, chronicity and high burden upon health care services make the&#xD;
      development of effective and accessible treatment for BPD a high priority. Yet there is no&#xD;
      current medication treatment indicated for BPD and the psychotherapies recognized for the&#xD;
      disorder have been shown to have small effect sizes and are of limited availability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study builds upon work by the study group that has shown that deficiencies in the&#xD;
      ability to regulate emotion by engaging typically adaptive cognitive strategies (cognitive&#xD;
      reappraisal, CR) and to effectively activate associated neural systems can be corrected by&#xD;
      focused training in CR. The R61 phase of this study examines a manualized intensive training&#xD;
      program in CR, tests that it effects target neural systems implicated in emotional processing&#xD;
      and enhances behavioral reappraisal success. It examines 2-, 4- and 6- weeks of twice a week&#xD;
      treatment to identify the optimal dose. Measures include fMRI imaging and clinical ratings at&#xD;
      baseline and each of these subsequent time points. Upon demonstrating that CR training is&#xD;
      superior to a control condition in enhancing performance in the neural target at one or more&#xD;
      of these dose durations, the study team will proceed to the R33 phase. In the R33 phase the&#xD;
      study team will treat a larger sample of BPD patients at the optimal dose defined in the R61&#xD;
      phase to 1) demonstrate reproducibility of the R61 findings, 2) to demonstrate that CR&#xD;
      training is superior to control in improving BPD clinical outcomes at the end of treatment&#xD;
      and at 1- and 4- month follow-up, and 3) that change in activity at the neural targets is&#xD;
      associated with clinical improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study can support the introduction of CR training as a new psychosocial&#xD;
      approach for the treatment of BPD, either as stand-alone treatment or as an augmenting&#xD;
      strategy. It may, moreover, have application to a range of psychiatric disorders&#xD;
      characterized by severe emotional instability.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in ZAN-BPD sector scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at 2-,4-, and 6-weeks and 1 and 4 months after treatment ends.</time_frame>
    <description>There are three affective symptoms in the ZAN-BPD (with a sector score ranging from 0-12): inappropriate anger/frequent angry acts, mood instability, and chronic feelings of emptiness. There are two cognitive symptoms (with a sector score ranging from 0-8): stress-related paranoia/dissociation and severe identity disturbance. (Identity disturbance was placed in the cognitive realm because it is based on a series of false beliefs or overvalued ideas, such as that one is a bad person.) There are also two impulsive symptoms (with a sector score ranging from 0-8): self-mutilative/suicidal efforts and at least two other forms of impulsivity. Finally, there are two symptoms in the interpersonal realm of BPD (with a sector score ranging from 0-8): frantic efforts of avoid abandonment and intense, unstable relationships. The four sector scores sum to provide a total score of borderline psychopathology, which ranges from 0-36. Higher score indicates poorer health outcomes</description>

    <measure>Change in Affective Lability Scale total (ALS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at 2-,4-, and 6-weeks and 1 and 4 months after treatment ends.</time_frame>
    <description>The ALS-SF consists of 18 items which are rated on a four-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (&quot;very uncharacteristic of me&quot;) to 3 (&quot;very characteristic of me&quot;). Five of the items refer to shifts in anxiety/depression, eight refer to shifts in depression/elation, and the final five items concern shifts between anger and normal mood. The scale yields a total score of AL (the sum of all item responses divided by 18), as well as subscores for the three affective domains. Total score range from 0 to 54, with higher score indicating more affective lability.</description>

Items are rated on a scale of 1 (&quot; almost never [0-10%] &quot;) to 5 (&quot; almost always [91-100%] &quot;). Total scale from 6-216.
