  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To establish feasibility and safety of the use of external pop out as a novel technique for&#xD;
      foetal head delivery during c s, the effect of application of this method on a previously&#xD;
      scarred uterus will be studied as a better way regarding preservation of the integrity of the&#xD;
      lower uterine segment, operative time, time needed for head delivery, incision extension,&#xD;
      blood loss, incidence of bladder injury.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Caesarean delivery (cs) is the most common major surgical procedure performed with over&#xD;
      1,2million performed per year . The increase in caesarean section rates seems uncontrollable&#xD;
      with no signs that it is slowing down .&#xD;
&#xD;
      A great concern of caesarean delivery complications is incision extension , un intended&#xD;
      extensions of uterine incision frequently occurs at the time of caesarean delivery with&#xD;
      estimated incidence of 4-8% .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some measures are taken to guard against incision extension as expansion of uterine incision&#xD;
      in cephalocaudal direction which is associated with lower risk of un intended extension Head&#xD;
      extraction during caesarean section is one of the most critical steps during caesarean&#xD;
      section and one of the major contributors to un intended uterine incision extension .&#xD;
      Delivery of the foetal head should be within 3minutes from opening the uterine incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Difficult extraction causes different hazards as foetal respiratory distress syndrome ,&#xD;
      incision extension, bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The original technique of foetal head extraction entails introduction of obstetrician hands&#xD;
      or other instruments into lower uterine segment (LUS) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criticizing the standard:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insertion of obstetrician hand inside the uterine incision will occupy more space and this&#xD;
      will increase possibility of incision extension and puts the LUS at risk of damage and&#xD;
      increased blood loss, increased operative time , Interfere with head rotation &amp;repositioning&#xD;
      of the head may happen during head delivery leading to difficult extraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inadequate opening will add more pressure on uterine incision increasing possibility of&#xD;
      extension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In cases of repeated c s , lower uterine segment is thin, adherent to the urinary bladder&#xD;
      this makes the conventional method of head extraction unreliable causing more bleeding,&#xD;
      extension, bladder injury, more operative time, postoperative adhesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rational of EPO technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Support of the lower uterine segment and bladder without introduction of the obstetrician&#xD;
      hand in the uterine incision so as not to occupy more space ; this help rotation of the&#xD;
      foetal head facilitating head delivery, protecting LUS incision from extension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative sonographic assessment of the lower uterine segment thickness will be done&#xD;
      within two weeks of delivery using transabdominal us with critical cut off value of 2.5 mm&#xD;
      which is associated with dehiscent scar according to ROC curve.&#xD;
