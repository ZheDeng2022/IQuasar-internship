  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Zadaxin in the treatment&#xD;
      of HIV-positive patients with immune reconstitution disorders. Researchers previously used&#xD;
      Thymosin α-1 (Tα1) as an immune adjuvant for people infected with HIV-1 and found that Tα1&#xD;
      and Interferon-α (IFN-α) have a synergistic effect in immune enhancement. In addition,&#xD;
      studies have found that the triple combination of Tα1, IFN-α and Zidovudine (AZT) has better&#xD;
      tolerability, safety and efficacy. After treatment, patients have lower HIV RNA and more&#xD;
      stable high CD4+ T cell counts. In addition, extensive studies on the administration of Tα1&#xD;
      in thymectomized mice have demonstrated its ability to promote immune reconstitution. The&#xD;
      researchers hypothesized that Zadaxin has a better therapeutic effect on HIV-positive&#xD;
      patients with immune reconstitution disorders, can increase the CD4+T cell count, reduce the&#xD;
      viral load, and has better safety.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients received Zadaxin (1.6 mg subcutaneous injection, once a day) in the first 2&#xD;
      weeks, and changed frequency (1.6 mg subcutaneous injection, twice a week) in the second 22&#xD;
      weeks. It is still recommended to continue treatment until the end of the study. All subjects&#xD;
      were given HAART treatment throughout. In 4th week, 8th week, 12th week and 24th week,&#xD;
      perform 4 follow-up and record the changes in CD4+ T cell count, CD8+ T cell count, CD45 RO+&#xD;
      and RA+ in CD8+ and CD4+ cells, PBMC sjTREC, viral load, PBMC PD-1 and Tim-3. During the&#xD;
      process, safety assessment is performed, including adverse events, electrocardiogram and a&#xD;
      series of laboratory tests (blood routine, liver and kidney function, etc.).&#xD;
