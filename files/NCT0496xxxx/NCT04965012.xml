  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cannabis is a frequently-used psychoactive substance. While the majority of individuals can&#xD;
      use cannabis without experiencing problems, a small minority of people develop cannabis&#xD;
      problems. Despite the small-to-medium reported effect sizes of cognitive behavioural therapy&#xD;
      (CBT) and motivational enhancement therapy (MET) treatments for cannabis misuse, many&#xD;
      cannabis users do not seek treatment. Online CBT/MET programs have the potential to be&#xD;
      cost-effective and accessible, and offer a less stigmatizing option for treatment. These&#xD;
      programs may also help capture cannabis users who experience subclinical problems, who are&#xD;
      not captured by traditional treatment. Existing treatment programs also need to be adapted to&#xD;
      maximize participant retention and increase treatment completion, as many current cannabis&#xD;
      use treatment programs have significant drop-out rates. Hence, the goal of the proposed&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to examine the efficacy of an online evidence-based&#xD;
      CBT/MET treatment program. Outcomes of a combined CBT/MET treatment program will be compared&#xD;
      to a CBT-only treatment program and a waitlist control. This research will provide insight&#xD;
      into the novel contribution of MET to online CBT treatment programs for cannabis misuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers are hoping to recruit 303 participants for this study from Central and&#xD;
      Eastern Canada. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the treatment groups (i.e.,&#xD;
      CBT with MET, CBT without MET) or the psychoeducational control group. Individuals in either&#xD;
      treatment group will be given 6 weeks to work through 8 online modules. Throughout the&#xD;
      modules, participants will identify goals related to cannabis use, learn strategies to cope&#xD;
      with cannabis cravings, triggers, and social pressures and learn to prevent relapse.&#xD;
      Participants randomly assigned to the control (i.e., psychoeducation) will receive links to&#xD;
      websites that provide general psychoeducation about cannabis use and wellbeing. All&#xD;
      participants will complete online assessment measures at baseline, end of treatment, and at&#xD;
      follow up approximately one month later (i.e., 0 weeks, 6 weeks, 10 weeks) in order to assess&#xD;
      the efficacy of the treatment. At the end of the study, individuals in the control group will&#xD;
      be given access to the CBT without MET treatment.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Participants will be assessed using the DFAQ-CU at three time points (i.e., prior to treatment; T0); immediately following the 6-week treatment (T1), and at follow-up (i.e., 10 weeks from baseline, 4 weeks from end of treatment, T2).</time_frame>
    <description>The Daily Sessions, Frequency, Age of Onset, and Quantity of Cannabis Use Inventory (DFAQ-CU; Cuttler &amp; Spradlin, 2017) is a self-report inventory of cannabis use that will be used as the primary assessment of cannabis use. The frequency (i.e., number of days per week) and quantity (i.e., grams) of cannabis use subscales will be used. There is mixed evidence as to whether frequency or quantity better predicts cannabis-related severity, thus information on both will be analyzed.</description>

    <description>The CBT with MET treatment condition will begin with an MET-therapist guided introduction to the program and first module.

Through module engagement, participants will identify goals related to cannabis use, learn strategies to cope with cravings, triggers, and social pressures, and learn to how prevent relapse. Participants will work through modules sequentially.</description>
