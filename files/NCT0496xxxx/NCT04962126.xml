    <textblock>
      This single-arm phase II interventional study aims to assess disease response to, and&#xD;
      toxicity of, a combination of obinutuzumab and atezolizumab, with or without radiotherapy, in&#xD;
      treatment naive Follicular Lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will involve an induction phase and a maintenance phase for responding&#xD;
      participants, for up to 24 months. Response to treatment will be monitored using medical&#xD;
      imaging and clinical assessment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm phase II study of obinutuzumab, atezolizumab with or without RT in&#xD;
      treatment-naïve advanced FL. Participants will initially receive 2 cycles of induction&#xD;
      treatment with obinutuzumab and atezolizumab. During cycle 2, participants will undergo&#xD;
      disease assessment by PET/CT scan, results of which will determine further induction&#xD;
      treatment. Participants in Complete Medical Response (CMR) according to Lugano criteria will&#xD;
      receive an additional 4 cycles of induction treatment. Participants who achieve a partial&#xD;
      response (PR), stable disease (SD) or deemed to have minor/asymptomatic progressive disease&#xD;
      (PD) will also receive 4 further cycles of induction treatment, with the addition of&#xD;
      involved-site RT to residual sites of disease (4Gy in 2 fractions), administered between&#xD;
      cycle 3 and cycle 4. Participants with symptomatic PD following 2 cycles of induction&#xD;
      treatment will not receive any further study treatment. Further treatment will be at the&#xD;
      discretion of the treating clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the induction phase, disease response will again be assessed by PET/CT scan.&#xD;
      All participants in CR, PR or SD will move into the maintenance phase of the study and will&#xD;
      receive obinutuzumab for 24 months (up to a total of 12 doses). Participants with PD at the&#xD;
      end of induction will cease protocol treatment and further treatment will be as per local&#xD;
      guidelines.&#xD;
