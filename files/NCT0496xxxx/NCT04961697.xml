  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate in the Brazilian context, the impact of the implementation of a&#xD;
      diary program on patient and family-centered outcomes after PICU discharge. The intervention&#xD;
      investigated will be the use of hospital diaries for the critically ill child in a cross-over&#xD;
      study, randomized by clusters in four PICUs of Rio de Janeiro. Family members of children&#xD;
      aged 29 days to 12 years, admitted for more than 36 hours will be included and data&#xD;
      collection will take place upon admission, at PICU discharge and 60 days after discharge from&#xD;
      the PICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Family-centered outcomes assessed will be: satisfaction with care, anxiety and depression at&#xD;
      discharge, incidence of anxiety, depression, PTSD, burden and quality of life in follow-up.&#xD;
      Patient-centered outcomes will be assessed in children at discharge and follow-up - quality&#xD;
      of life and incidence of new morbidities will be evaluated. The association of clinical,&#xD;
      social and demographic variables with family- and patient-centered outcomes will be&#xD;
      investigated on an exploratory basis. Burnout Syndrome in PICU health professionals will be&#xD;
      assessed before and after the intervention as a proxy of intervention security for PICU&#xD;
      staff.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More than one third of parents and patients admitted to Pediatric Intensive Care Units (PICU)&#xD;
      develop Anxiety, Depression and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), with consequent&#xD;
      decrease in quality of life and great social impact, known as Pediatric and Family&#xD;
      Post-Intensive Care Syndrome (PICS and PICS-F). Strategies that minimize negative outcomes&#xD;
      after discharge have been adopted, such as the use of hospital diaries to regularly record&#xD;
      the impressions of family members and health professionals about the patient's evolution,&#xD;
      hosting parents and encouraging their direct participation in care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate in the Brazilian context, the impact of the implementation of a&#xD;
      diary program on patient and family-centered outcomes after discharge. The intervention&#xD;
      investigated will be the use of hospital diaries for the critically ill child in a cross-over&#xD;
      study, randomized by clusters in four PICUs of Rio de Janeiro, totaling 200 family members in&#xD;
      the intervention group and 200 controls. Family members of children aged 29 days to 12 years,&#xD;
      admitted for more than 36 hours will be included and data collection will take place upon&#xD;
      admission, at discharge and 60 days after discharge from the PICU. Family-centered outcomes&#xD;
      assessed will be: satisfaction with care, anxiety and depression at discharge, incidence of&#xD;
      anxiety, depression, PTSD, burden and quality of life in follow-up. Quality of life and&#xD;
      incidence of new morbidities will be evaluated in children at discharge and follow-up, as&#xD;
      well as Burnout Syndrome in the health team. The association of clinical, social and&#xD;
      demographic variables with family- and patient-centered outcomes will be investigated on an&#xD;
      exploratory basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this study, we aim to contribute to a better knowledge about different family-centered&#xD;
      outcomes in intensive care, allowing reduction of health problems and the development of&#xD;
      policies that seek to alleviate suffering, to humanize intensive environments and encourage&#xD;
      participation of family members in child care during hospitalization.&#xD;
