  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infertility affects approximately 1 in 6 couples and may require the use of Medically&#xD;
      Assisted Reproduction techniques. In France, there were more than 60,000 in vitro&#xD;
      fertilization (IVF) attempts in 2016. The burden of the IVF process is even more significant&#xD;
      for working women, causing significant absenteeism due to medical appointments but also to&#xD;
      the psychological discomfort caused by the management (Bouwmans et al., 2008). Unfortunately,&#xD;
      there are no studies that specifically address the quality of life of working women&#xD;
      undergoing IVF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our cohort project aims to measure quality of life using validated questionnaires (FertiQoL,&#xD;
      STAI Anxiety Scale and BDI Depression Inventory) in active patients who are scheduled for a&#xD;
      first IVF attempt. Quality of life will be measured before starting treatment and at embryo&#xD;
      transfer and will be followed up at each embryo transfer for a maximum period of 18 months.&#xD;
      The follow-up will end after the live birth of a child or at the end of the 18 months of&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also evaluate, by means of a specific questionnaire, the satisfaction with the&#xD;
      interactions between professional and private life (management and consequences of&#xD;
      absenteeism at work, consequences on professional evolution, anxious repercussions in the&#xD;
      professional and private domains) in the active women undergoing IVF treatment.&#xD;
