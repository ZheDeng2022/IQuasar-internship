  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebrovascular disease is the main cause of death and severe long-term disability worldwide.&#xD;
      Antiplatelet drugs are the main drugs for ischemic stroke and TIA. Cyclooxygenase inhibitor&#xD;
      acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) has always been the most widely studied antiplatelet therapy. The&#xD;
      studies of acrates of aliscon body evaluated the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor&#xD;
      monotherapy in preventing major vascular events in patients with AIS or TIA. The results&#xD;
      showed that the number of patients with endpoint events in ticagrelor group was less than&#xD;
      that in ASA group, However, it has not been proved that ticagrelor monotherapy is better than&#xD;
      ASA. The purpose of this study is to prove that ticagrelor is better than ASA.&#xD;

      conducted in multiple centers to ensure the representation of multiple countries, races and&#xD;
      races, so as to ensure that the results of the study can be widely applied.&#xD;
