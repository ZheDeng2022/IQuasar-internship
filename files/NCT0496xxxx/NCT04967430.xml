  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interferon (IFN) lambda is one of the fundamental responses of the innate immune system.&#xD;
      Peginterferon lambda is a long-acting form that has been studied extensively in human trials&#xD;
      in viral hepatitis, confirming it safety and tolerability. It is particularly attractive for&#xD;
      consideration in the use of acute respiratory illness due to the high expression of the&#xD;
      lambda receptor in lung epithelia. We propose to evaluate peginterferon-lambda in ambulatory&#xD;
      patients with mild to moderate COVID-19.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, individuals who attend an Assessment Centre/Emergency Department to be swabbed&#xD;
      for COVID-19 and deemed well enough for home isolation will be informed about the study.&#xD;
      There will be two major routes of recruitment. Where feasible, a rapid point-of-care (POC)&#xD;
      laminar flow based COVID-19 test (the Abbott PanBio) will be performed and those who do not&#xD;
      have a POC test at the assessment centre will be tested by PCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interested participants who contact study staff will be confirmed to have a positive COVID-19&#xD;
      test. Once confirmed will be further screened for eligibility criteria by research study&#xD;
      staff. After review, a consent form will be emailed to the participant and informed consent&#xD;
      will be obtained through witnessed telephone consent from the participant or a substitute&#xD;
      decision maker (SDM). Participants who consent will be randomized to receive a single&#xD;
      subcutaneous injection of Peginterferon lambda 180Âµg or saline placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed remotely with visits. In addition, participants will also attend&#xD;
      outpatient clinic for swabs and blood work for routine laboratory and inflammatory markers on&#xD;
      Days 7 and 14 with the primary endpoint being the time to SARS-CoV-2 RNA negativity and the&#xD;
      proportion with COVID-19 related emergency room assessment &gt;6 hours, hospitalization or death&#xD;
      by Day 28. Numerous secondary endpoints will be evaluated as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety data will be reviewed by the Data Safety and Monitoring Committee after the first 50%&#xD;
      of randomized participants complete 14 days of follow-up after treatment.&#xD;

    <description>Peginterferon lambda is a covalent conjugate of human recombinant non-pegylated IFN lambda (IFN L) and a 20-kDa linear PEG chain.&#xD;
Peginterferon lambda Injection is a sterile, nonpyrogenic, ready-to-use solution (0.4 mg/mL) that is clear to opalescent, colorless to pale yellow, and essentially free of particles. Lambda Injection is provided in a 1-mL long Type I glass syringe (0.18 mg/syringe) with a staked 29-gauge, 1/2- inch, thin-walled needle. The syringe has a rigid needle shield and is stoppered with a plunger stopper. Syringes are prefilled with a solution of Peginterferon lambda Injection, mannitol, L-histidine, polysorbate 80, hydrochloric acid, and water for injection; they are intended for a single use at adjustable doses. The syringe is marked with dose indicator lines, which are used as a reference point for administering the correct dose.</description>
