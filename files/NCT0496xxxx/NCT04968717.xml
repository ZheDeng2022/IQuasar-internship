  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some individuals are able to spontaneously control HIV replication, the so-called 'elite&#xD;
      controllers' (ECs). ECs are crucial for our understanding of HIV infection. While there is&#xD;
      more and more evidence pointing towards a role of the innate immune system in elite control,&#xD;
      no research has been performed on the role of innate trained immunity in elite control of&#xD;
      HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this cross-sectional case-control study, we will study this role of trained immunity in&#xD;
      HIV elite control by comparing ECs both to a non-HIV-infected first-degree relative, and to&#xD;
      HIV patients who are not elite controllers. In addition, we will study whether HIV itself can&#xD;
      induce a trained innate immunity phenotype.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It remains unknown how some individuals spontaneously control HIV in the absence of&#xD;
      antiretroviral medication, called HIV 'elite controllers' (ECs). ECs have been absolutely&#xD;
      crucial to our current understanding of control of HIV replication. While research has mainly&#xD;
      focused on the adaptive immune system, there is a vast amount of evidence indicating that the&#xD;
      innate immune system is essential to HIV elite control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trained innate immunity can be expressed in terms of enhanced responsiveness of innate immune&#xD;
      cells to a repeated trigger. This occurs through epigenetic remodeling after exposure to&#xD;
      certain stimuli, such as beta-glucan, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or the bacillus&#xD;
      Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine. Innate training results in an altered gene expression and&#xD;
      metabolic reqiring on a cellular level, resulting in greater resistance against subsequent&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the impact of trained immunity on HIV infections and vice versa, the impact of HIV on&#xD;
      trained immunity, are unknown. Our hypothesis is that ECs are natural hyper-responders to&#xD;
      innate immune training triggers and that this aids in the HIV elite control phenotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. (Primary) Investigate if a trained immunity profile in innate immune cells plays a role&#xD;
           in HIV elite control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. (Secondary) Determine the immune phenotypes that distinguish family members of HIV elite&#xD;
           controllers from family members of people living with HIV who have never been&#xD;
           controllers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. (Secondary) Determine whether HIV can induce a long-term functional and transcriptional&#xD;
           program in innate immune cells similar to trained immunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cross-sectional case-control study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the primary objective, HIV elite controllers will be compared to ART-suppressed HIV&#xD;
      patients who never have been elite controllers and first-degree relatives of HIV elite&#xD;
      controllers will be compared to first-degree relatives of ART-suppressed HIV patients who&#xD;
      have never been elite controllers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the secondary objectives, first, a system biology approach will be used in the comparison&#xD;
      above. To determine the role of HIV in trained innate immunity we will compare people living&#xD;
      with HIV (both controllers as non-controllers) to their respective family members.&#xD;

        A recent query of the Dutch national database of HIV (Athena Cohort; Stichting Hiv&#xD;
        Monitoring (SHM)) revealed there are approximately 138 HIV elite controllers in the&#xD;
        Netherlands, according to the definition used in the 2000HIV study. Of these, 80 HIV elite&#xD;
        controllers are expected to participate in the 2000HIV study. Thanks to the query, each one&#xD;
        of four 2000HIV participating centers is notified about who the HIV elite controllers in&#xD;
        their center are. All HIV elite controllers participating in the 2000HIV will be approached&#xD;
        and asked whether they have a first-degree relative who is available and willing to have a&#xD;
        single venipuncture.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        All participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All participants must be ≥18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Due to distorting effects on immune parameters and immune responses, participation is&#xD;
             either not possible or must be delayed in case of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  active hepatitis B/C or signs of acute infections&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  active or recent malignant condition (i.e. &lt;12 months ago treated)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  active systemic auto-immune or auto-inflammatory conditions (such as rheumatoid&#xD;
                  arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  use of immunosuppressive medication&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  pregnant&#xD;
&#xD;
        HIV elite controllers:&#xD;
&#xD;
        HIV elite controllers in the 2000HIV that have an available first-degree relative.&#xD;
        Definition of HIV elite controller is the same as in the 2000HIV, see definition on page 7&#xD;
        of the protocol and in the group description.&#xD;
&#xD;
        ART-suppressed people living with HIV:&#xD;
&#xD;
        As a control group, ART-suppressed people living with HIV in the 2000HIV that have an&#xD;
        available first-degree relative will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        ART-suppressed people living with HIV need to apply to the following criteria to&#xD;
        participate in the 2000HIV: ≥18 years, on cART ≥6 months with an HIV-RNA load &lt;200&#xD;
        copies/mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For this 2000HIV-trained study, additional criteria for ART-suppressed people living with&#xD;
        HIV are:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Never applied to controller definition.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least one documented HIV RNA load &gt;100.000 copies/mL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No documentation of recent HIV acquisition combined with ART initiation in less than 6&#xD;
             months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Eligible ART-suppressed people living with HIV will be matched by sex and age (max. 5-10&#xD;
        years apart), where possible. Similarity in family members between groups will also be&#xD;
        pursued. That is why the HIV elite controllers and their family members will be enrolled&#xD;
        first. Thereafter, the ART suppressed people living with HIV and their family members will&#xD;
        be recruited and enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        First-degree relatives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Aside from the criteria for all participants mentioned above, there are no additional&#xD;
        criteria for first-degree relatives of participants with HIV. If multiple first-degree&#xD;
        relatives are available, siblings are preferred. If no sibling is available, then children&#xD;
        &gt;18 years. If no children &gt;18 years, then parents. If there is still multiple options,&#xD;
        same-sex will be preferred over different-sex relatives.&#xD;
