      This study was designed to conduct Turkish adaptation, cross-cultural adaptation, validity,&#xD;
      and reliability study of Graded Chronic Pain Scale 2.0 in order to use it for Turkish people&#xD;
      with Chronic Pain.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The GCPS 2.0 is an eight-item scale that evaluates the severity of chronic pain, the presence&#xD;
      of persistent pain due to pain days, and the degree of disability due to pain. It is easy,&#xD;
      simple, useful and multidimensional. 80 volunteer participants who had chronic low back pain&#xD;
      were studied.The data collection tools used in this study were; Clinic and Demographic&#xD;
      Evaluation Form, Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Index, Patterns of Activity Measure Pain,&#xD;
      Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire, Hospital Anxiety, and Depression Scale, and Graded&#xD;
      Chronic Pain Scale 2.0. In this study, the forms were sent by e-mail. The Snowball sampling&#xD;
      method was used in the data collection process.The stages of the Beaton Protocol were&#xD;
      followed in the translation of the scale. Validity was evaluated with the Face, Content, and&#xD;
      Construct validity analyses. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were applied to&#xD;
      determine the construct validity of the Turkish version of the scale. Reliability was&#xD;
      evaluated with the test-retest method, the parallel forms method, and the internal&#xD;
      consistency. Ten days after completing the scale, 30 participants filled out the scale again&#xD;
      for the Test-retest method. One of the scales we used for the parallel forms method was RMDQ&#xD;
      and the other was ODI.&#xD;

    <description>Some established activity patterns reduce patients' quality of life with chronic pain, increase their pain, and limit their movement. These are modified patterns such as Overdoing, Avoidance, Pacing. POAM-P determines which of these patterns chronic pain patients use. There are 10 questions in each subsection, also 30 questions in total.</description>
