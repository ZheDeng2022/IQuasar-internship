    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8 and Week 16 or Week 20</time_frame>
    <description>The partial Mayo (pMayo) is a composite score to indicate ulcerative colitis status without the requirement for endoscopy. It records participant-reported stool frequency over three days relative to normal on a 0-3 subscale (stool frequency, rectal bleeding, and physician global assessment of disease severity) each graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating more severe disease. These scores are summed to give a total score range of 0 to 9; where higher scores indicating more severe disease.</description>

Abdominal Pain will be evaluated based on numeric rating scale (NRS) ranging from 0 to 10 with lower score of 0 indicating 'no pain', score of 5 indicating 'moderate pain' and higher score of 10 indicating 'worst pain'. The abdominal pain score represents the most severe pain of the day.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Perceived Improvement in Ulcerative Colitis (UC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants with perceived improvement in UC will be reported. Perceived Improvement in UC will be evaluated based on NRS ranging from 0 to 10 with lower score of 0 indicating 'completely better (no UC symptoms)', score of 5 indicating 'starting condition (condition immediately before the induction of ustekinumab)' and higher score of 10 indicating 'poor condition (lots of UC symptoms).' Improvement is shown by recording a number less than 5 and worsening by recording a number greater than 5.</description>
