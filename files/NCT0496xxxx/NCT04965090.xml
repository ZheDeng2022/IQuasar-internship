  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The researchers think that the study drugs, amivantamab and lazertinib, may be an effective&#xD;
      treatment for people who have metastatic NSCLC with an EGFR mutation. Both drugs work to&#xD;
      target cancer cells with an EGFR mutation, and this targeting action could stop or slow the&#xD;
      growth of cancer cells. The researchers are doing this study to find out how well amivantamab&#xD;
      and lazertinib work against metastatic NSCLC with an EGFR mutation.&#xD;

                  contraception; placement of intrauterine device [IUD] or intrauterine system&#xD;
                  [IUS], AND, a second method (e.g., condom with spermicidal&#xD;

                  who is not heterosexually active becomes active, premenarchal woman experiences&#xD;
                  menarche) the woman must begin a highly effective method of birth control, as&#xD;
                  described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A woman of childbearing potential must have a negative serum (b-human chorionic&#xD;

             drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A man who is sexually active with a woman of childbearing potential must agree to use&#xD;
             a condom with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository and his partner must also be&#xD;
             practicing a highly effective method of contraception (i.e., established use of oral,&#xD;
             injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception; placement of an intrauterine&#xD;
             device [IUD] or intrauterine system [IUS]). If the subject is vasectomized, he must&#xD;
             still use a condom (with or without spermicide), but his female partner is not&#xD;
             required to use contraception. The subject must also not donate sperm during the study&#xD;
             and for 6 months after receiving the last dose of study drug&#xD;
