  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MIS-ABC Sepsis is a sub-study looking to understand how the immune response in patients with&#xD;
      infection changes during the early stages of the illness, as well as after intravenous fluid&#xD;
      treatment. Participants in the main trial will be given one of two types of fluid (Human&#xD;
      Albumin Solution (HAS) and Balanced Crystalloid) via a drip when they present to the hospital&#xD;
      with severe infection (sepsis). The main trial is assessing which fluid is better, and we are&#xD;
      going to take three blood samples around the time people come to hospital to see what happens&#xD;
      to their immune system as a result of the infection and fluid treatment. We hope our findings&#xD;
      will explain why one fluid might be better than another. It may also give us an important&#xD;
      information about whether we can predict which people might get sicker despite treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MIS-ABC Sepsis is linked to the ABC-Sepsis trial, a pilot feasibility trial recruiting&#xD;
      patients with community acquired infection/sepsis with a NEWS2 score of five or more and&#xD;
      randomising the participants to receiving either balanced crystalloid or 5% HAS as the&#xD;
      intravenous resuscitation fluid up to six hours after randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MIS-ABC Sepsis will take serial blood samples from a small number of these participants, at&#xD;
      hospital presentation and at two further points early during the patient's admission, to&#xD;
      allow analysis of how inflammation changes during their course of illness. Investigating&#xD;
      temporal change and differences between treatment arms of the main study will allow a nuanced&#xD;
      analysis of the interplay between severity of illness, physiological changes over time and&#xD;
      any potential differences between fluid treatment arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective observational study enrolling patients randomised to the ABC Sepsis&#xD;
      study. Centres for this trial will be selected from UK NHS hospitals who are recruiting to&#xD;
      the main ABC Sepsis study. Participants will be recruited as soon as possible, and up to 12&#xD;
      hours after presentation to the Emergency Department, Surgical Assessment Unit or Medical&#xD;
      Admissions Unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment phase of the main study spans 6 hours following randomisation, with the follow&#xD;
      up period extending to 90 days. This sub-study requires three blood samples: immediately&#xD;
      after enrolment, at approximately 12 and 24 hours thereafter. The follow up period similarly&#xD;
      extends to 90 days, using routine data from the medical records for follow up.&#xD;
