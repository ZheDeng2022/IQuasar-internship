  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to the existing clinical data in our hospital, retrospective study was conducted to&#xD;
      screen the risk factors with predictive value for TRC(trastuzumab-related cardiotoxicity)&#xD;
      risk, and to construct the risk prediction model for TRC.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The breast cancer patients with cardiotoxicity caused by trastuzumab were selected as the&#xD;
      case group, and the breast cancer patients without cardiotoxicity were selected as the&#xD;
      control group. The clinical baseline data, echocardiographic parameters and serum markers of&#xD;
      the case group and the control group were compared to find out the risk factors that may have&#xD;
      predictive value for the risk of TRC. The target factors were analyzed by univariate analysis&#xD;
      and multivariate Logistic regression analysis, and the TRC risk prediction model was&#xD;
      established.&#xD;
