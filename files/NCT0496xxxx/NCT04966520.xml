  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is aimed at the discovery of neuro-modulation techniques that may alleviate&#xD;
      chemotherapy induced cognitive deficits (CICD), especially in executive (higher-order)&#xD;
      cognitive function (EF).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The specific aim for this study is to use magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), self-report,&#xD;
      and neuropsychological testing to identify changes in brain metabolite concentrations/ratios&#xD;
      and changes in EF deficits associated with chemotherapy, before and after accelerated&#xD;
      theta-burst transcranial stimulation (iTBS). The secondary aim is to assess for any&#xD;
      association of changes in executive function with brain metabolite concentrations.&#xD;

    <description>Executive cognitive function will be quantified using technician administered Color Word Interference Test, Category Fluency, Tower of Hanoi, Card Sort and Strategy Application Task (Shallice &amp;Burgess) tests, and the self-report Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Cognitive Scale (FACT-COG) (Dyk et al.). Executive Function (EF) is measured by utilizing standardized test scores adapted from the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function Scales (D-KEFS battery) (Homack et al.). FACT-COG, Category Fluency and Strategy Application Task use raw scores. All EF measures used in this battery form a part of a normative database created and maintained by the principle investigator of this study. An overall score of EF is computed by averaging the Z scores of each test. Higher score on each test represents better performance.</description>

    <description>Patients will participate in the prospective longitudinal research protocol over a period of 1.5 months.&#xD;
Treatment will include 8 visits of either accelerated repetitive intermittent theta-burst transcranial stimulation (iTBS) or iTBS sham stimulation. Patients will be informed that iTBS sham stimulations will be part of the protocol (but will be blind to when treatment/sham will be administered).</description>

    <intervention_name>Accelerated repetitive intermittent theta-burst transcranial stimulation (iTBS)</intervention_name>
    <description>Accelerated iTBS will be used to stimulate the regions of interest of mPFC and L-DLPFC nodes in cancer survivors or patients.&#xD;
Accelerated iTBS will be administered in a single half-day period to allow for a 50minutes interval between any two treatments to minimize interference effects between treatments. Thus, there will be ~10 minute sessions of stimulation x 2 applications per node x 2 nodes (L-DLPFC, mPFC) = 40 total minutes of daily stimulation - each session delivers 1800 pulses in a 5 Hz triplet burst frequency, 2 second trains with intertrain interval of 8 seconds; triplets occur with 50 Hz frequency, as per standard iTBS protocols for depression treatment. The treatment will be offered for five consecutive days.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women or men with a history of non-metastatic cancer who have completed definitive&#xD;
             curative cancer therapy&#xD;

          -  Patients must report subjective symptoms of &quot;chemo-brain&quot; (memory loss, difficulty&#xD;
             with concentration, word-finding difficulties) with a FACT-Cog perceived cognitive&#xD;
             impairment score &lt; 60&#xD;

             Developmental insult to the PFC, can be associated with long-term, durable and&#xD;
             sometime debilitating cognitive deficits. Hence, we avoid any cognitive confounds that&#xD;
             maybe related to this issue.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a weight over 250 lbs., as these patients would not fit in the MRI&#xD;
             scanner used in the protocol&#xD;

             metal. Any other specific contraindication to TMS or MRI not already listed above,&#xD;
             including:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  (a) any implanted device in the head, neck or upper body (e.g. cochlear implant,&#xD;
             cranial or other electrodes, pacemaker or defibrillator, medication pump, stent,&#xD;
             aneurysm clip, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  (b) personal history of seizures or epilepsy, personal history of multiple concussions&#xD;
             or unexplained loss of consciousness. This will be determined by physician judgement&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Active substance use disorder in the past 6 months, excluding tobacco use disorder, as&#xD;
