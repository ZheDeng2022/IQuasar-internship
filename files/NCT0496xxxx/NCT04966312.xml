      To examine if educational digital video disk can reduce maternal anxiety and depression if&#xD;
      their children undergo congenital heart disease surgery and when surgical or post-surgical&#xD;
      complications occur. Compared to only routine education, adding digital video disk could&#xD;
      decrease mothers' anxiety more after education, and until the day of discharge. Compared to&#xD;
      only routine education, adding digital video disk could decrease mothers' anxiety more on the&#xD;
      discharge day if their child had surgical or post-surgical complications.&#xD;

      Aims and objectives: To examine if educational digital video disk can reduce maternal anxiety&#xD;
      and depression if their children undergo congenital heart disease surgery and when surgical&#xD;
      or post-surgical complications occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Mothers experience anxiety and depression if their children undergo conditions&#xD;
      mentioned above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A randomized control-group pretest-posttest design. The CONSORT checklist is used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: In a teaching hospital, 120 mothers whose children underwent first elective surgery&#xD;
      for congenital heart disease were randomly divided into group 1: 60 mothers receiving routine&#xD;
      education plus digital video disk before surgery; and group 2: 60 mothers receiving routine&#xD;
      education. Between groups, mothers' anxiety and depression levels were compared (1) before&#xD;
      education, (2) after education (before surgery) and (3) on the discharge day. Among mothers&#xD;
      whose children had surgical or post-surgical complications, the effect of watching the&#xD;
      digital video disk on anxiety and depression at discharge day was evaluated.&#xD;
