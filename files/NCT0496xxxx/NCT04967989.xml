  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to understand if SLT performed at low energy is as effective as SLT&#xD;
      performed at standard energy, and also to see if repeating SLT at low energy once a year will&#xD;
      prevent or delay the need for daily eye drop medications better than waiting for SLT to wear&#xD;
      off before repeating it.&#xD;

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>First Randomization: Low Energy SLT</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Low energy SLT will consist of 100 treatment spots delivered at 0.4mJ per spot throughout the full 360° treatment, with the exception that energy can be reduced to 0.3mJ if bubbles are seen with 5 consecutive spots and can be increased back to a maximum of 0.4mJ is no bubbles are seen with 5 consecutive spots.&#xD;
Regardless of energy level randomization, energy may be adjusted downward in 0.1mJ increments throughout the procedure in response to factors such as heavy focal pigmentation or patient discomfort.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>First Randomization: Standard Energy SLT</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Standard SLT will be performed as follows: beginning at 0.8 mJ, energy will be titrated up or down within the first 5-10 spots until champagne bubbles are visualized with every 2nd or 3rd spot. Energy can be titrated throughout the procedure, in response to variations in pigmentation, to ensure the appearance of champagne bubbles with every 2nd or 3rd spot throughout the full 360° treatment. Energy should be increased if no bubbles are seen with 5 consecutive spots and decreased if bubbles are seen with 5 consecutive spots.&#xD;
Regardless of energy level randomization, energy may be adjusted downward in 0.1mJ increments throughout the procedure in response to factors such as heavy focal pigmentation or patient discomfort.</description>
