  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trastuzumab resistance, which is a common therapeutic challenge in HER2 positive metastatic&#xD;
      breast cancer, is not fully understood. Pyrotinib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor&#xD;
      targeting EGFR, HER-2 and HER-4 receptors. More general inhibition of ErbB family with&#xD;
      pyrotinib could provide additional benefit. Inetetamab could bind to HER2 extracellular&#xD;
      domain (ECD) with high affinity and inhibit proliferation of multiple HER2-overexpressing&#xD;
      cancer cell lines as a single agent or in combination with trastuzumab. This study is&#xD;
      designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pyrotinib and vinorelbine tartrate capsulesin&#xD;
      with or without Inetetamab for first line treatment in patients with HER2 positive metastatic&#xD;
      breast cancer who had early failure on or after trastuzumab treatment.&#xD;
