        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age ≥ 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Chest pain for &gt; 20 min with an electrocardiographic ST-segment elevation ≥ 1 mm in&#xD;
             two or more contiguous electrocardiogram (ECG) leads or an infero-lateral myocardial&#xD;
             infarction (MI) with ST segment depression of ≥ 1 mm in ≥ 2 of leads V1-3 with a&#xD;
             positive terminal T wave.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. TIMI Thrombus Grade ≥ 3 in the infarct related artery. In cases where TIMI Thrombus&#xD;
             Grade is equal to 5 (i.e. TIMI 0 flow in the infarcted artery), TIMI Thrombus Grade of&#xD;
             at least 3 has to be re-confirmed with AWI. Patients showing TIMI Thrombus Grade of&#xD;
             less than 3 upon AWI are no longer eligible for randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Start of intervention within 8 h of symptom onset&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject is willing and able to provide informed consent prior to the intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Unconscious patients&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Infarct related artery diameter, at visual assessment, smaller than 2.5 mm&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Presence of severely calcified plaque(s) proximal to or at the site of the culprit&#xD;
             lesion(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Presence of extreme vessel tortuosity proximal to or at the site of the culprit&#xD;
             lesion(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Women of child-bearing potential (e.g. below 55 years of age, who have not undergone&#xD;
             tubal ligation, ovariectomy or hysterectomy and last menstruation within the last 12&#xD;
             months)&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Stent thrombosis as culprit lesion&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Previous myocardial infarction in the same territory (i.e. same target vessel)&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Participation in another interventional clinical trial&#xD;
