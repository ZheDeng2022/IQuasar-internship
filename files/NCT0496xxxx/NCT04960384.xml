  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a double blinded, placebo-controlled phase II study evaluating the efficacy of&#xD;
      FGF-2 for the treatment of chronic non-healing tympanic membrane perforations (TMP). The&#xD;
      documentation of TM closure will be the main efficacy outcome measure. Pretreatment&#xD;
      photographs will document the area of the TM perforation and allow measurement of surface&#xD;
      areas of the TMP for comparison of pre- and post-treatment. The study will be divided into&#xD;
      two phases, the Randomized Treatment phase (part A), and the Unblinded Crossover phase (part&#xD;
      B). In part A of the study, subjects will be randomized 1:1 (using simple randomization) to&#xD;
      receive FGF-2 or placebo treatment up to 3 treatments. Subjects that fail three study&#xD;
      treatments will move on to part B of the study. Subjects who received placebo in part A and&#xD;
      failed three placebo treatments will crossover to receive unblinded FGF-2 for up to 3&#xD;
      treatments. Subjects who received FGF-2 in part A and failed three experimental treatments&#xD;
      will not have additional FGF-2 treatment, and will move on to study follow up.&#xD;

    <description>The FGF-2 method of use comprises a pledget of gelatin sponge, with human fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) added to the pledget just before topical application to the tympanic membrane, and the use of fibrin glue used for applications in ear surgery. The concentration of the FGF-2 solution will be 100μg of FGF-2 per 1 mL with an estimated dose of about 20 μg in 0.2ml. Fibrin glue will be applied to secure gelatin sponge after placement according to the size of the membrane perforation. Application of the study treatment will occur at Visit 1 and may be repeated at each follow up visit as needed for a maximum of three treatments in the Randomized Treatment Phase (Visit 1, Visit 2, and Visit 3).</description>
