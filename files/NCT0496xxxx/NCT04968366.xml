      This is a single-center, single-arm phase I study to determine the safety and preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy of autologous dendritic cells (DCs) loaded with multiple tumor neoantigen peptides&#xD;
      administered as a cancer-treatment vaccination for the treatment of newly-diagnosed&#xD;
      glioblastoma (GBM). The subjects are adult GBM patients who have undergone surgical&#xD;
      resection. After the completion of TMZ concurrent chemoradiation, and, during conventional&#xD;
      adjuvant TMZ chemotherapy, subjects will receive autologous DC vaccine treatments as&#xD;
      scheduled. Ten subjects will be enrolled. The autologous genetic-modification-free DC cells&#xD;
      will be loaded with multiple tumor neoantigen peptides and administered (i.d) to subjects.&#xD;
      After 5 injections, the investigator will review subject's tolerance and compliance, and&#xD;
      decide whether or not to administer more DC vaccines up to 8 injections. For certain patients&#xD;
      with good tolerance and clinical response of the DC vaccine, peripheral blood is extracted&#xD;
      after completion of TMZ adjuvant chemotherapy to assess patient's immune response. According&#xD;
      to the result, investigators will be decided whether to perform more 1-2 treatment cycles&#xD;
      (5-8 infections/cycle) to strengthen the effectiveness.&#xD;

The positive response is defined as &quot;≥ 55 spot-forming cells in each million PBMCs&quot; or &quot;number of spot-forming cells increase by 3-fold after the DC vaccination compared with the baseline&quot;.</description>
