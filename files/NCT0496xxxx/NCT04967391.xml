  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our primary objective is to determine if the use of tumescence has a meaningful effect on&#xD;
      STSG uptake at the recipient site. This is an important outcome because poor graft uptake&#xD;
      results in the need for prolonged local wound care, additional clinic visits for patients and&#xD;
      increased risk of infection. A prospective, randomized comparison of the tumescence to our&#xD;
      current standard of care will allow us to definitively evaluate any benefits to this&#xD;
      technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumescence is commonly used in the treatment of burn patients to minimize blood loss during&#xD;
      both tangential excision of eschar and during harvest of split-thickness grafts for&#xD;
      reconstruction. This is considered the standard of care in burn surgery as using tumescence&#xD;
      has been clearly demonstrated to reduce intraoperative blood loss during harvest of large&#xD;
      skin grafts and excision of large burns when compared with the application of topical&#xD;
      epinephrine as was the historic standard practice.4-6 Tumescence also creates a firm and&#xD;
      uniform surface from which to harvest the skin graft, which the investigators believe may&#xD;
      improve the quality of harvest and rate of skin graft take.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multimodal treatment for head and neck cancer often includes surgical resection. Large tumors&#xD;
      leave behind large anatomical defects when resected, which require reconstruction to&#xD;
      rehabilitate form and function after ablative surgery. Two commonly used reconstructive&#xD;
      options in reconstructive surgery are the radial forearm free flap and the fibula free flap.&#xD;
      These in turn leave cutaneous defects at the donor site which must be reconstructed to&#xD;
      protect the underlying soft tissues, muscles, and tendons exposed as a result of their&#xD;
      harvest. This is effectively accomplished with a split thickness skin graft harvested from&#xD;
      the thigh, which generally results in excellent coverage of the free flap donor site and&#xD;
      minimal skin graft donor site morbidity. 1-3 Using a free flap for reconstruction following&#xD;
      surgical tumor ablation often leaves behind a donor site that cannot be closed primarily and&#xD;
      at our institution these defects are reconstructed using split-thickness skin grafts (STSG)&#xD;
      harvested from the thigh. This creates an additional wound that must be carefully monitored,&#xD;
      as poor skin graft take or failure can result in exposed muscle or tendon at the donor site.&#xD;
      While many of these wound-healing complications can be treated with simple dressings, this&#xD;
      can create added stress, another site of potential infection, and delayed healing and return&#xD;
      to function.1-3 Tumescence of the skin graft harvest site involves a deep dermal infiltration&#xD;
      of normal saline with epinephrine to the thigh prior to skin graft harvest. This has been&#xD;
      demonstrated to minimize intraoperative blood loss4-6 and is routinely utilized in burn&#xD;
      surgery where extensive skin grafting is often required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of tumescence on skin graft quality and take has not been evaluated. Anecdotally,&#xD;
      it is our impression that this procedure may yield a lower graft failure rate thereby&#xD;
      decreasing post-operative extremity immobility, risk of infection and wound care&#xD;
      requirements.2 In this study, the investigators plan to compare the quality and take of split&#xD;
      thickness skin grafts harvested with and without tumescence. Our results will have important&#xD;
      implications for how split thickness skin grafting is performed in head and neck&#xD;
      reconstructive surgery.&#xD;
