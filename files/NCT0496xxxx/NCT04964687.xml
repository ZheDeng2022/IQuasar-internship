  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigator seeks to determine wether integrating an addiction team into a liver&#xD;
      transplantation unit improves the prognosis of patients with alcohol-related liver disease&#xD;
      requiring liver transplantation. Our hypothesis is that patients managed by an addiction team&#xD;
      before and after liver transplantation have less frequent alcohol relapses, thus decreasing&#xD;
      the risk of cardiovascular complications, de novo cancer, recurrence of alcohol-related&#xD;
      cirrhosis, and consequently increasing their overall survival.&#xD;

      In this observational, retrospective and multicentre study, investigator seek to determine&#xD;
      the effect of integrating an addiction team into liver transplantation unit on prognosis of&#xD;
      patients with alcohol-related liver disease requiring liver transplantation. Investigatore&#xD;
      plan to compare patients in 2 groups, depending on whether they have received or not specific&#xD;
      addiction care before and after transplantation. This study was conducted over a period of 15&#xD;
      years in three French liver transplant units.&#xD;
