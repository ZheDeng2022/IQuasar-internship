  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2017, the number of operations on hospitalized patients in China was more than 57 million,&#xD;
      of which more than 20 million were performed on elderly patients (â‰¥65 years of age). As of&#xD;
      the end of 2017, there were 143 million elderly people over 65 years old in China, of which&#xD;
      26 million people were 80 years old and over, accounting for 1.8% of the country's total&#xD;
      population, and this proportion is increasing. More and more elderly patients need surgery. A&#xD;
      study showed that compared with the 65-79-year-old population, the probability of myocardial&#xD;
      infarction after orthopedic surgery in patients over 80 years of age increased by 2.7 times,&#xD;
      the probability of lung infection increased by 3.5 times, and the mortality rate increased by&#xD;
      3.4 times. The inherent risks of surgery and increased postoperative complications in elderly&#xD;
      patients are closely related to factors such as senile syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Geriatric syndrome refers to the deterioration of the function of various organ systems as&#xD;
      the age increases, and a series of non-specific symptoms and signs appear in the elderly,&#xD;
      including weakness, comorbidities, cognitive dysfunction and so on. These symptoms increase&#xD;
      with age, seriously impairing the quality of life of the elderly and increasing their&#xD;
      perioperative risk. Taking frailty as an example, the incidence of frailty among the 65-70&#xD;
      years old population is 3.2%, 71-74 years old is 5.3%, 75-79 years old is 9.5%, 80-84 years&#xD;
      old is 16.3%, and&gt; 85 years old is 25.1. %. On the other hand, the physical functions of the&#xD;
      elderly are constantly degrading with age. Take skeletal muscle as an example. After the age&#xD;
      of 50, the skeletal muscle mass decreases by 1%-2% every year with the increase of age. The&#xD;
      chronic muscle loss of people over 60 years old is estimated to be 30%, and the elderly&#xD;
      people over 80 years old lose up to 50%. It can be seen that the elderly patients are a&#xD;
      special group of elderly patients, which have their particularity compared with the low-age&#xD;
      elderly groups. Therefore, the establishment of a perioperative risk warning and control&#xD;
      system and technical system for elderly patients to deal with the unpredictable perioperative&#xD;
      risks caused by their weakness, comorbidities, and physical hypofunction, and to provide&#xD;
      safety guarantees for elderly surgical patients has become an urgent problem for geriatrics.&#xD;

      Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) is based on evidence-based medicine and optimizes the&#xD;
      clinical path of perioperative management through the collaboration of multiple departments.&#xD;
      The core is patient-centered promotion of rehabilitation. This concept is deeply rooted in&#xD;
      the hearts of the people. In this context, the center intends to use the high incidence of&#xD;
      hip fractures and lung cancer in elderly patients as a breakthrough, and combine the center's&#xD;
      domestic leading visualization technology and artificial intelligence (AI) technology to&#xD;
      create a complete perioperative evaluation system for elderly patients to reduce the&#xD;
      perioperative risk of elderly patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visualization techniques include visualization of airway tools, ultrasound visualization, and&#xD;
      visualization of brain function monitoring, etc., which are widely used in preoperative risk&#xD;
      assessment, bedside rapid assessment, airway management, auxiliary vascular puncture, guided&#xD;
      regional block anesthesia, postoperative analgesia, etc. Links, and achieved good clinical&#xD;
      results. These technologies have their own advantages, but lack systematic integration and&#xD;
      targeted optimization. Organically integrate various visualization technologies suitable for&#xD;
      elderly patients to create a complete perioperative evaluation system for elderly patients,&#xD;
      comprehensive and real-time dynamic evaluation of patients, and realize the perioperative&#xD;
      mental, neurological, respiratory, and circulatory functions of elderly patients Precise&#xD;
      management reduces the stress and damage of important organs (such as heart, lung, brain,&#xD;
      kidney, etc.), achieves the holistic management of elderly patients during the perioperative&#xD;
      period, and reduces the risk of elderly patients during the perioperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Artificial intelligence technology can deeply mine medical big data, integrate a large amount&#xD;
      of complex data and have powerful comprehensive analysis functions. It is suitable for&#xD;
      assisting elderly patients with complex preoperative evaluation, perioperative medical&#xD;
      decision-making, and real-time warning of unpredictable adverse events. This technology has&#xD;
      been widely used in various medical fields, including tumor imaging diagnosis, skin disease&#xD;
      diagnosis, diabetes diagnosis, etc. At present, foreign scholars have combined the relevant&#xD;
      clinical characteristics of patients and used artificial intelligence technology to develop&#xD;
      an early warning system for intraoperative hypotension, a real-time early warning system for&#xD;
      monitoring the death risk of inpatients, and an in-hospital cardiac arrest prediction system.&#xD;
      Artificial intelligence is used to comprehensively assess and predict perioperative risks and&#xD;
      real-time early warning, which will cover the entire perioperative period of elderly patients&#xD;
      and implement effective risk control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inherent risks of surgery and postoperative complications of elderly patients increase.&#xD;
      To deal with the unpredictable perioperative risks caused by their weakness, comorbidities,&#xD;
      and hypofunction, providing safety guarantees for elderly surgical patients has become a&#xD;
      major issue in geriatrics. This project uses visualization technology for preoperative&#xD;
      evaluation, anesthesia management, bedside real-time monitoring and intervention, etc., to&#xD;
      achieve accurate perioperative management of elderly patients and whole-process whole-person&#xD;
      management. AI technology is applied to perioperative risk prediction of elderly patients and&#xD;
      real-time follow-up risk warning to guide the control of the depth of anesthesia and the&#xD;
      maintenance of organ function. The above technologies are organically integrated around the&#xD;
      various situations that increase the perioperative risk of elderly patients, and embedded in&#xD;
      the closed loop of evaluation-diagnosis-intervention-re-evaluation to create a complete&#xD;
      perioperative evaluation system for elderly patients. And through a multi-disciplinary team&#xD;
      to optimize the clinical path of perioperative management, to demonstrate the whole-person&#xD;
      risk management system for elderly patients during the perioperative period for further&#xD;
      promotion.&#xD;
