  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite opioid-based multimodal analgesia, moderate-to-severe pain remains a big problem in&#xD;
      patients following multi-segment spinal fusion. As a N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor&#xD;
      antagonist, S-ketamine has prominent analgesic effects through activating receptors both in&#xD;
      the brain and in the spinal cord, inhibiting the excitatory postsynaptic potential, and thus&#xD;
      blunting nociception transmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized controlled trial is designed to investigate whether perioperative S-ketamine&#xD;
      infusion can decrease pain intensity after major spine fusion surgery.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multi-segment spinal fusion usually lasts long and produces significant trauma. Patients&#xD;
      following this surgery are at high risk of developing moderate-to-severe pain. In a large&#xD;
      sample size cohort study investigating pain severity following 179 kinds of surgical&#xD;
      procedures, multi-segment spinal fusion ranked the third with a median pain score of 6.6&#xD;
      (assessed with an 11-point scale, where 0=no pain and 10= the worst pain) and a median&#xD;
      morphine consumption of 27 mg during the first postoperative day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High-dose opioids are associated with adverse effects including respiratory depression,&#xD;
      sedation, nausea and vomiting, pruritus, and constipation, which are harmful for early&#xD;
      postoperative recovery. A previous study showed that about 50% of patients are taking opioids&#xD;
      for chronic pain at 3 months after spinal fusion surgery. Chronic pain is considered to be a&#xD;
      result of poorly controlled acute postoperative pain. Thus, multimodal analgesia aiming at&#xD;
      improving analgesia while decreasing opioid consumption is advocated to control acute&#xD;
      postsurgical pain, in order to promote perioperative recovery and prevent chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Racemic ketamine, a commonly used N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, is a mixture of&#xD;
      equal parts of two optical isomers including R-(-)-ketamine and S-(+)-ketamine. It has&#xD;
      prominent analgesic effects through activating receptors both in the brain and in the spinal&#xD;
      cord, inhibiting the excitatory postsynaptic potential, and thus blunting nociception&#xD;
      transmission. Additionally, studies also showed that, when used within the appropriate time,&#xD;
      ketamine reduces pain-related sensitization that aggravates postoperative pain. Thus,&#xD;
      ketamine is recommended as a part of a multimodal analgesia regimen in clinical practice,&#xD;
      especially for patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery. However, the reported&#xD;
      psychotropic side effects limit the clinical use of racemic ketamine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      S-ketamine, an S-isomer of ketamine, is twice as potent as the racemic mixture in analgesia,&#xD;
      and produces fewer side effects than the racemic ketamine. How, there are only a few studies&#xD;
      exploring analgesic effect of S-ketamine in spine fusion surgery. In opioid-dependent&#xD;
      patients, Nielsen et al. reported that intraoperative S-ketamine infusion reduced opioid&#xD;
      consumption within 24 hours and relieved back pain intensity at 6 months, it also decreased&#xD;
      the daily opioid use at 1 year after spinal surgery. On the other hand, the study of Brinck&#xD;
      et al. did not found any superiority of intraoperative S-ketamine in reducing oxycodone&#xD;
      consumption within 48 hours after lumbar fusion surgery in opioid-naive patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering these inconsistent results, the effects of S-ketamine in spinal surgery require&#xD;
      further clarification. This trial is designed to investigate the analgesic effect of&#xD;
      S-ketamine infused both intraoperatively and postoperatively in patients undergoing&#xD;
      multi-segment spine infusion surgery.&#xD;
