  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gait alteration is frequent in MS and limitation in walking ability is a major concern in MS&#xD;
      patients. The development of wearable device offers the opportunity to collect data during&#xD;
      daily activity including walking.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Umanit and LMJ (Nantes university) has developed a device call eMSgait to assess walking&#xD;
      ability in MS patients individuals (eg MS patients). This device consists in a commercialized&#xD;
      IMU sensor (MetaMotionR Sensor, Mbientilab) worn at the right hip, a smartphone app and&#xD;
      dedicated algorithm/mathematical model to extract raw sensor data and calculate individual&#xD;
      gait pattern (IGP). This IGP consists of a curve, based on quaternion and representing the&#xD;
      rotation recorded by the IMU during an average gait cycle. Pursue first pilot work assessing&#xD;
      information from IGP on gait alteration in MS.&#xD;

    <description>Correlation of gait measures (mean amplitude of walking cycles (m), mean duration of walking cycles (s), Stance swing phase ratio) obtained during a walk of 25 feet with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). EDSS is an ordinal scale measuring disability and ranging from 0 (normal examination) to 10 (death due to MS) in a 0,5-point increments from score 1.</description>
