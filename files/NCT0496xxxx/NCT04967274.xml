  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Accurate movement execution is a result of a complex interplay between various muscle groups&#xD;
      whose activity is controlled by different areas of the central nervous system. Besides the&#xD;
      corticospinal system, the phylogenetically old reticulospinal system is a key motor system&#xD;
      controlling different elementary movements including posture, locomotion and reaching across&#xD;
      all mammals. In contrast to the extensively investigated corticospinal system, there is only&#xD;
      sparse knowledge on the motor physiology of the functionally important reticulospinal system&#xD;
      in humans. Reticulospinal motor control can be assessed with the StartReact paradigm which is&#xD;
      based on the activation of reticulospinal motor circuitries by startling acoustic stimuli.&#xD;
      The StartReact phenomenon is characterized by a shortening in movement reaction time which is&#xD;
      mediated by a startle-triggered, early release of a planned motor program by the&#xD;
      reticulospinal system. Thus, StartReact is a unique tool to examine reticulospinal&#xD;
      involvement on human motor control under physiological and pathological conditions.&#xD;
      StartReact assessments will be supplemented by comprehensive 3-D kinematic analysis and&#xD;
      muscle activity recordings (i.e. electromyography) to gain quantitative insights into&#xD;
      reticulospinal movement control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first objective of this clinical study is to gain more insights into the mechanisms&#xD;
      underlying StartReact and to advance the knowledge on reticulo-spinal motor physiology&#xD;
      regarding different movement tasks (i.e. simple single-joint movements, complex multi-joint&#xD;
      movements and bilateral hand movements) in healthy subjects. The findings of these&#xD;
      experiments will provide new insights into proximal-distal, flexor-extensor and upper-lower&#xD;
      extremity gradients in reticulospinal motor control of healthy subjects. Moreover, the&#xD;
      results will expand the StartReact paradigm to complex, functionally more relevant movements&#xD;
      (i.e. reaching and stepping tasks requiring endpoint accuracy; co-operative, bilateral hand&#xD;
      movements) for which the involvement of the reticulo-spinal system is not yet understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second goal of this project is to use the StartReact paradigm to shed more light onto the&#xD;
      role of reticulospinal plasticity in functional recovery of patients with spinal cord injury&#xD;
      (SCI). Whereas preclinical findings emphasize a remarkable potential of the reticulospinal&#xD;
      system for neuroplastic adaptations underlying functional recovery, there is only little&#xD;
      evidence from clinical trials in the field of SCI. First, the study aims at monitoring&#xD;
      StartReact effects in hand and leg muscles of patients with acute SCI over a period of 6&#xD;
      months. Simultaneous tracking of StartReact effects and motor recovery will allow to closely&#xD;
      relate processes of reticulospinal plasticity to functional recovery in patients with acute&#xD;
      SCI. Second, the focus will be on the re-weighting of descending motor control (i.e. cortico-&#xD;
      vs. reticulospinal system) in response to SCI and investigate the distinct contributions of&#xD;
      the cortico- and reticulospinal system to motor recovery in patients with chronic SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The findings of this project will advance the mechanistic understanding on the motor&#xD;
      physiology and neurorestorative capacity of the reticulospinal system in humans. New insights&#xD;
      from these projects will hopefully translate into a better exploitation of this important&#xD;
      motor system in clinical trials that aim to improve motor recovery in patients with SCI.&#xD;
