  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a single-site, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial of&#xD;
      lavender aromatherapy versus placebo for patient satisfaction in adult women having a&#xD;
      surgical abortion before 10 weeks and 0 days gestation. The investigators will evaluate&#xD;
      whether lavender aromatherapy is an effective adjunct therapy for patient satisfaction during&#xD;
      first trimester surgical abortion. The investigators will measure satisfaction using the Iowa&#xD;
      Satisfaction with Anesthesia Scale (ISAS). The investigators hypothesize that women receiving&#xD;
      lavender aromatherapy will report higher satisfaction scores compared to women receiving&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior studies have investigated the use of aromatherapy in laboring patients, in menstruating&#xD;
      women, and in general post-operative populations. No investigations have focused on the use&#xD;
      of lavender aromatherapy as an adjunct therapy to paracervical block and/or oral narcotics&#xD;
      and anxiolytics in outpatient surgical abortion. Our study is novel in investigating patient&#xD;
      satisfaction with first trimester surgical abortion using lavender aromatherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The contribution of this proposed research to the literature is significant because current&#xD;
      affordable anesthetic adjuncts to opioids and benzodiazepines are limited.&#xD;

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Difference in patient satisfaction in those who receive oral sedation compared to those who receive no sedation, in patients receiving lavender aromatherapy versus placebo. Satisfaction is measured through a 3-item post-procedure questionnaire with Likert scale responses ranging from &quot;Strongly Agree&quot; to &quot;Strongly Disagree</description>

    <measure>Maximum Procedural Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Difference in maximum procedural pain as measured by Visual Analog Scale (VAS) in patients receiving lavender aromatherapy versus placebo. The VAS is presented as a 10-centimeter line with descriptive anchors at each end, &quot;no pain&quot; on the left at 0 centimeters and &quot;pain as bad as it could be&quot; at 10 centimeters. Respondents place a vertical line through the point on the scale that best fits their experience with their procedural pain and that mark is measured as a continuous variable for pain from 0 to 10 (no pain to pain as bad as it could be).</description>

    <description>Study randomization to lavender aromatherapy or placebo will occur just prior to the initiation of the abortion procedure. A permutated block stratified randomization scheme will be utilized so that equal numbers of participants receiving no sedation and PO sedation will be randomized to lavender aromatherapy or placebo. 1cc of dilute lavender aromatherapy and placebo will be pre-filled in a 5/8 dram mini amber glass bottle provided to the patient. Immediately prior to procedure start (defined as after receiving antibiotic and emptying bladder), participants will be instructed to self-administer the study product. They will bring down their personal cloth mask to chin level and rub the study product within the amber glass bottle on their upper lip and nose (left and right ala, alarfacial grooves, and columella). Participants will be instructed to take 4 deep breaths and then replace their mask over their nose. The patient will then proceed to the procedure.</description>
