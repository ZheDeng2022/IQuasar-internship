  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled double-blinded pilot trial was performed in the Medical University&#xD;
      of Vienna, Department of Special Anesthesia and Pain Medicine between 2015 and 2018. Aim of&#xD;
      the study was to assess the effect of regular electrotherapy applied on the spinal cord of&#xD;
      patients with chronic non-specific neck pain and/or low-back pain. The hypothesis was that&#xD;
      subjective feeling of pain, range of motion of the cervical and lumbar region, as well as the&#xD;
      activity in daily living improved after weekly electrotherapy sessions for 30 min each.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic neck pain and low-back pain are common causes for the decrease in quality of life.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, efficacy of medical therapy is limited (Maher et al, 2017), and evidence for&#xD;
      the efficacy of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) therapy for both chronic&#xD;
      neck pain (Martimbianco et al, 2019), as well as for chronic low-back pain (Khadilkar et al,&#xD;
      2008) is scarce .&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the aim to assess the effectiveness of regular electrotherapy in chronic pain patients&#xD;
      applied via a mat covering the whole spinal cord, and thus allowing deeper current&#xD;
      penetration into the tissue compared to conventional TENS, male and female patients with&#xD;
      chronic neck pain or low back pain aged 18 years or over were enrolled in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After informed consent, patients were randomly divided in three groups: Group 1 (verum)&#xD;
      received right after device calibration suprathreshold electrotherapy on the whole back for&#xD;
      30 min weekly, Group 2 (Control) received device calibration without consequent&#xD;
      electrotherapy, Group 3 (Control of Control) just lay on the mat without receiving device&#xD;
      calibration nor electrotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrotherapy was applied using a mat covering the whole spinal cord called &quot;StimaWELL&quot;.&#xD;
      Therefore, all the patients were asked to put off the clothes and lay supine on the mat for&#xD;
      30 min in each session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome was the subjective pain sensation measured with the numeric pain rating scale&#xD;
      (NRS). Secondary outcomes were cervical and lumbar range of motion and activities in daily&#xD;
      living.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data recorded before and after the sessions (i.e. NRS at rest, NRS under activity, average&#xD;
      NRS in the last four weeks, maximum and minimum NRS, and Short-form Mc Gill Pain&#xD;
      Questionnaire for pain sensation, measurement of the lumbar range of motion using Modified&#xD;
      Schober and measurement of cervical range of motion using the Cervical range of Motion Device&#xD;
      (CROM), assessment of activities in daily living using the Neck Disability Index and Rolland&#xD;
      Morris Questionnaire) was compared in each group,respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria were a numeric pain rating scale (NRS) equal or more than 5 prior to study&#xD;
      enrollment, and chronic pain in the cervical or lumbar Region longer than three month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria were pregnancy, prior experience in TENS, epilepsy, cardiac arrythmia,&#xD;
      cardiac operation prior to study enrollment including implanted pacemaker or defibrillator,&#xD;
      operation in the spinal cord, malignancies or infectious diseases affecting the spinal cord,&#xD;
      severe radicular pain with acute paralysis in the extremities or an ongoing pension&#xD;
      application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral pain medication had to be unchanged at least four weeks before the study enrollment.&#xD;
      Additional pain therapies like acupuncture, physical therapy, intravenous pain therapy or&#xD;
      intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of pain medication were not accepted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients, as well as the recruiting investigator and the physician performing the&#xD;
      physical measurements and questionnaires were blinded.&#xD;
