    <textblock>
      Background: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common chronic disease&#xD;
      characterized by persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow restriction, due to airway and/&#xD;
      or alveolar abnormalities usually caused by significant exposure to harmful particles or&#xD;
      gases, in particular cigarette smoking. Sleep disorders are common in society and it is not&#xD;
      surprising that they also affect individuals with COPD. Patients with COPD, especially those&#xD;
      in severe stages of the disease suffer from many sleep disorders and its prevalence varies&#xD;
      depending on the disease. Epidemiological studies report that approximately 75% of COPD&#xD;
      patients experience nocturnal symptoms of the disease. The most common are sleep-breathing&#xD;
      disorders (nocturnal hypoxemia, central sleep apnea, difficulty breathing, sleep-related&#xD;
      hypoventilation), insomnia and sensory motor disorders during sleep, including restless legs&#xD;
      syndrome. Patients with COPD not only experience poorer sleep quality and concomitant sleep&#xD;
      disorders but also have a higher chance of sudden nocturnal death, especially during a period&#xD;
      of COPD exacerbation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific studies show that elevated posture during sleep (&gt;30 degrees raised head and back&#xD;
      from the supine position) has a positive effect on sleep quality. To date, this has not been&#xD;
      proven in patients with COPD who are a special group with sleep disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions and objectives: The primary study objective is to evaluate if adjusted&#xD;
      sleeping position with electrical bed backrest improves the quality of sleep in patients with&#xD;
      COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exploratory objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate if adjusted sleeping position improves total sleep time, respiratory&#xD;
           patterns, oxygen saturation and heart rate (measured by CASIS, WatchPat and Sleepiz).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate if adjusted sleeping position decreases COPD-related symptoms during&#xD;
           sleep and daytime (measured with CAT score).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate if adjusted sleeping position reduces patient's fatigue during the day&#xD;
           (measured with FSS questionnaire).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To evaluate if better sleep at night is associated with more energy, more activity and&#xD;
           less breaks for rest during the day (measured with OQ-S, 6MWT and smartwatch).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To compare the results from the two sleep recording technologies (single night minimal&#xD;
           contact sleep recorder-WatchPat versus several nights without contact sleep&#xD;
           recorder-Sleepiz).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Prospective, open label, cross-over clinical trial with randomized treatment&#xD;
      order. Every subject will use the assigned intervention for 4 weeks. The intervention is an&#xD;
      electrical bed backrest used during sleep time. The randomization will be non-adjusted, in&#xD;
      ratio 1:1. A total of 40 patients will be included in the study.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Adjustable bed backrest</intervention_name>
    <description>The adjustable bed backrest facilitates for the individual high lying with a fowler (90 degrees raised head and trunk) and/or semi fowler position (30-45 degrees raised head and trunk) which enables patient's lung expansion. The diaphragm is pulled downwards by the gravity allowing for lung expansion and improved ventilation. In addition, the upper airways are stretched in order to prevent upper airway narrowing during sleep (flow limitation, snoring, obstructive sleep apnea). The position relaxes the tension of the abdominal muscles, allowing for improved breathing. Patients can define their own most comfortable position during the night. Elevated body position over 30 degrees from supine position is a requirement for the intervention group. No sleeping time restrictions will be applied. One week washout period between the interventions will be used.</description>
