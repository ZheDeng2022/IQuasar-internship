  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Macrovascular invasion (MVI) is common in HCC, Portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) is the most&#xD;
      common form of MVI in HCC, with an incidence ranging from 44 to 62.2%. About 10% to 60% of&#xD;
      HCC patients have PVTT at the time of diagnosis. the prognosis for those with PVTT remains&#xD;
      poor, as their median survival is only 2-4 months via supportive care. There is currently no&#xD;
      widely-accepted consensus for the management of HCC with PVTT. According to some guidelines&#xD;
      in Europe and America, HCC with PVTT is regarded as Stage C per Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer&#xD;
      (BCLC) Staging system, and sorafenib alone is recommended as the treatment of choice. This&#xD;
      study is to analyze the safety and efficacy of radiotherapy of hepatocellular carcinoma&#xD;
      patients with portal vein tumor thrombosis.&#xD;
