      A randomized, controlled, clinical trial on the efficacy of ERAS exercise improve&#xD;
      perioperative frailty in patients undergoing elective laparoscopic colorectal surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective to evaluate the efficacy of ERAS exercise improve perioperative frailty in patients&#xD;
      undergoing elective laparoscopic colorectal surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Patients undergoing elective laparoscopic colorectal surgery over 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research intervention was ERAS exercise&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design was a randomized, parallel controlled trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      ERAS exercise in perioperative period as the experimental group. No ERAS exercise group was&#xD;
      the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was estimated according to the main efficacy index ( the attenuation of&#xD;
      frailty after 7 days surgery) of this study. It was assumed that the attenuation of frailty&#xD;
      in the ERAS exercise group was better than that of the control group. The parameters were set&#xD;
      as test level (alpha) of 0.050 using a two-sided two-sample unequal-variance t-test, β = 0.9,&#xD;
      according to the results of previous clinical trials and combined with literature, the&#xD;
      population mean difference was 0.6 with standard deviations of 0.8 for the experimental group&#xD;
      and 0.8 for the control group. the experimental group: the control group was 1:1, 39 cases in&#xD;
      each group, considering the 20% shedding rate, 49 cases in the experimental group and 49&#xD;
      cases in the control group were selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The experimental group The patients take ERAS exercise from hospitalization to 30 days&#xD;
           after operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The control group The patients do not take ERAS exercise in perioperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The primary endpoint of the study was the attenuation of frailty via Frailty Phenotype&#xD;
           (FP) between before surgery and 7days, 30 days after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary endpoints included the 6-minute walk test (6MWT),nutritional risk screening&#xD;
           (NRS2002), anxious and depressive states, activities of daily living (ADL),postoperative&#xD;
           complications and mortality,short-term recovery quality,postoperative pain.&#xD;

    <description>Frailty status (i.e. robust, prefrail or frail) measured using the Fried's Frailty Phenotype (FP) scores. Frailty scores from 0 to 5 (i.e., 1 point for each component; 0 = best to 5 = worst) and represent robust (0), pre-frail (1-2), and frail (3-5) health status.</description>

    <measure>Perioperative functional capacity</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, at 30 days postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>The 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) test is a non-encouraged test performed in a 30 meters long flat corridor, where the participant is instructed to walk as far as possible, back and forth around two cones, with the permission to slow down, rest, or stop if needed. Ambulation was assessed via the 6MWD test following standardized procedures by measuring the 6MWD in meters. Participants were not permitted to use assistive devices (walker, long leg braces, or short leg braces) during the 6MWD test. Participants with confirmed loss of ambulation at a particular visit were assigned a 6MWD result of 0.</description>

    <measure>Patient mood state</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 7th day postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome will be assessed using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire. The HADS is a fourteen item scale. Seven of the items relate to anxiety and seven relate to depression. The anxiety and depression subscales each range from 0 to 21, with higher scores indicating higher anxiety/depression complains. Patients were defined as having anxiety or depression or both if the score was 8 or more in the corresponding subscale.</description>

Each of the 9 items are scored by the patient from 0 (worst score) to 2 (best score), giving a lowest possible score of 0 (worst outcome), and a highest possible score of 18 (best outcome).</description>
