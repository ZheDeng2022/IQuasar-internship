  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies have shown that certain biomarkers of schizophrenia could help to better&#xD;
      assess the individual course of the disease and thus, contribute to more personalized&#xD;
      treatment options. The aim of the SPIRIT study is to identify potential biomarkers for the&#xD;
      prediction of disease-associated outcomes by investigating the neurobiological mechanisms of&#xD;
      underlying schizophrenia-related dysfunctions.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alterations in psychosocial functioning are evident from the prodromal phase of schizophrenia&#xD;
      and play a crucial role in its chronic course. While recent studies have demonstrated the&#xD;
      predictive validity of structural changes in the brain anatomy of patients with&#xD;
      schizophrenia, there is a lack of studies assessing the predictive value of&#xD;
      disease-associated alterations in the functional brain activity for symptom severity and&#xD;
      psychosocial functioning in schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this longitudinal, observational study, 60 patients with schizophrenia, 30 healthy&#xD;
      first-degree relatives of persons with schizophrenia and 30 healthy subjects without family&#xD;
      history of psychotic illness will be recruited to investigate differences in behavioural,&#xD;
      physiological, and neural correlates of social touch and interoceptive perception between&#xD;
      participant groups. Participants' symptom severity and psychosocial functioning level will be&#xD;
      examined by a wide range of behavioural, physiological, and neural methods. Potential&#xD;
      biomarkers will be identified by estimating the predictive value of initially performed&#xD;
      methods on follow-up re-examination of clinical and psychosocial outcomes. Neural readouts&#xD;
      include structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measurements. The fMRI&#xD;
      tasks will probe the processing of social touch and interoceptive perception; additionally&#xD;
      resting-state connectivity will be assessed. To further investigate pathological distortions&#xD;
      of social touch and interoceptive perception, bodily touch allowance maps will be measured&#xD;
      and participants will perform a heart-beat discrimination task. Psychometric questionnaires&#xD;
      and semi-structured interviews will be used to capture symptom load and level of psychosocial&#xD;
      functioning. Long-term effects will be assessed by online questionnaires and semi-structured&#xD;
      interviews via phone call 3- and 6 months after initial assessments. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that differences in the neural response to social touch as well as in the neural&#xD;
      patterns of interoceptive perception could serve as potential biomarkers for psychosocial&#xD;
      deficits during the course of the illness. Furthermore, the inclusion of those biomarkers in&#xD;
      predictive models could improve the prediction of disease progression and thus, contribute to&#xD;
      personalized therapy.&#xD;
