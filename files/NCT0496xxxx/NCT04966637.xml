  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) affects the airways that causes shortness of&#xD;
      breath, cough. COPD gets worse over time, and often leads to emergency department visits,&#xD;
      hospital visits, frequent doctor appointments and medications. This means COPD is expensive,&#xD;
      and severely impacts patient quality of life. Unfortunately, patients are often not properly&#xD;
      diagnosed until their disease is fairly advanced. We know a lot about the health care use of&#xD;
      people with COPD once they have been diagnosed, but we do not know much about what happens to&#xD;
      them leading up to their diagnosis. Through this project we want to better understand the&#xD;
      time period prior to COPD diagnosis, so that we can learn more about what happens to people&#xD;
      before they are diagnosed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will use health data to find out if we can identify trends in health care use by&#xD;
      individuals newly diagnosed with COPD. We will identify people that have COPD based on health&#xD;
      records, and look back to find out about their health care use prior to their diagnosis. We&#xD;
      will look at data related to doctors' visits, emergency department visits, hospital stays and&#xD;
      medications. We want to use these markers to better understand what happens to people before&#xD;
      they are diagnosed, and to find out if we can identify risk factors for a COPD diagnosis. We&#xD;
      hope by doing this research we can better identify people at risk for COPD and ensure that&#xD;
      they receive treatment early, which may improve their health outcomes.&#xD;

      Study Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Identifying a cohort of individuals with a new onset of COPD in the between April 1,&#xD;
           2016 and March 31, 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine factors associated with a new diagnosis of COPD through using traditional&#xD;
           mixed-model regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate whether information collected within administrative data can be used to&#xD;
           create a prediction model for a COPD diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine whether machine learning methodology improves the prediction of a new COPD&#xD;
           diagnosis from administrative data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The cohort of individuals with COPD in Alberta has already been defined, and this data&#xD;
           exists within the Alberta Health Services, Respiratory Health Strategic Clinical Network&#xD;
           (RHSCN) dataset. It will be used to further identify individuals with a new diagnosis of&#xD;
           COPD within the three year study time period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In order to conduct this study, a variety of data sets will be used including:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Inpatient Discharge Abstract Database;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Practitioner Claims Database;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Provincial Registry Database;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Population Health Database and&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Pharmaceutical information Network&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project Hypothesis We anticipate individuals with a diagnosis of COPD in the last three years&#xD;
      will have identifiable markers associated with lung disease in the five years prior to their&#xD;
      diagnosis. These markers may include: diagnosis of acute respiratory disease (such as&#xD;
      pneumonia, bronchitis, upper respiratory infections), increased health care utilization, and&#xD;
      the use of medications such as antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project plan will address the specific project goals as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Identifying a cohort of individuals with a new onset of COPD from April 1, 2016 to March&#xD;
           30, 2019. Through the RHSCN, a cohort of individuals with COPD has been identified of&#xD;
           over 200,000 individuals with COPD in Alberta. This cohort will be refined to identify&#xD;
           only those individuals that have been diagnosed within the specified time period. This&#xD;
           time period was chosen due to data availability. Given our most recent data, we know&#xD;
           that approximate 19,000 individuals have been diagnosed with COPD per year, over the&#xD;
           last five years. Thus we can approximate that our dataset will include approximately&#xD;
           55,000 individuals with COPD diagnosed in a three year time period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Retrospectively review the pattern of health care utilization for individuals with a new&#xD;
           diagnosis of COPD in the five years prior to their diagnosis. The health care&#xD;
           utilization (ED visits, hospitalization visits, physician visits) for each case in the&#xD;
           cohort for the previous five years will be identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Explore the medication use for individuals with COPD for five years prior to their&#xD;
           diagnosis. Lastly, the medication use for each case identified in the cohort during the&#xD;
           time period five years prior to their diagnosis will be explored. The Pharmaceutical&#xD;
           Information Network (PIN) database will be used to identify all medications (both&#xD;
           respiratory and non-respiratory) for individuals in the cohort to assess medication use&#xD;
           prior to diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Working with the machine learning provider (AltaML) we will additionally conduct a&#xD;
           machine learning based analysis to further explore this data set regarding the same&#xD;
           variables.&#xD;

    <description>This retrospective annual analysis will use the following validated case definition to identify a cohort of individuals with COPD: an individual aged 35 years and older having at least one visit to a physician with a diagnosis of COPD (by ICD-9(-CM) 491-492, 496) or one hospital separation with a diagnosis of COPD (ICD-10-CA J41-44) between April 1, 2016 and March 31, 2019.&#xD;

        The study population includes all individuals in the province of Alberta that meet the&#xD;
        inclusion criteria, and have accessed the provincial health care system during the study&#xD;
        period. All individuals that have an incident case of COPD within the 3 year time period&#xD;
        for study inclusion that reside in Alberta will have their data included in the study.&#xD;
        Based on our pre-existing knowledge of the administrative data available, we would expect&#xD;
        over 50,000 individual patients in the cohort. Given our health care is provided at a&#xD;
        provincial level, we would expect this would capture all individuals in the province that&#xD;
        had their incident diagnosis of COPD in the time period. The exception may be individuals&#xD;
        that were diagnosed with COPD while out of province.&#xD;
