      The purpose of the study to investigate the comparison of the swallowing functions of the&#xD;
      sarcopenia and dynapenia in older patients&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sarcopenia is a geriatric syndrome; from skeletal muscle, and in its usefulness. Dynapenia is&#xD;
      a picture of sarcopenia without measurable muscle mass. It has been shown that dysphagia&#xD;
      complaints are more common in patients with sarcopenia than in the normal population, but a&#xD;
      comparison with patients with dynapenia has not been made to the best of our knowledge.&#xD;
      According to the algorithm of The International Society of Physical and Rehabilitation&#xD;
      Medicine (ISPRM), experts in the special interest group on sarcopenia, in the routine&#xD;
      examination of patients aged 60-90 years who applied to the Physical Medicine and&#xD;
      Rehabilitation outpatient clinic with complaints of decreased muscle function, weakness, and&#xD;
      slow movement, or &quot;sarcopenia&quot; or Patients with &quot;dynapenia&quot; and patients without Sarcopenia&#xD;
      disease who volunteered to participate in the study will be included in the order of&#xD;
      application to the outpatient clinic.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The values of Pharyngeal Residue Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>It was assessed with Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing. Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing results were scored on Yale Pharyngeal Residue Severity Rating scale. The scores of scale were none, trace, mild, moderate, and severe. The high-grade symptom scores were worst, low scores were good swallowing functions.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The values of penetration and aspiration</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>It was assessed with Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing. Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing results were scored on the Penetration and aspiration scale. The scores of scale were between 1-8 points. The high points were worst, low points were good swallowing functions.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The evaluation of eating and swallowing functions</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>They were assessed by Eating Assessment Tool in participants. Composite Score ranges from 0 ( good) to 4 (worst). The minimum total score was 0 and the maximum total score was 40. The cut-off value was 3 points. High scores show worst eating and swallowing functions, and low quality of life.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The evaluation of depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>They were assessed by Geriatric Depression Scale in participants. The scores between 0-10 were no depression, between 11-13 points were probably depression, and higher of 14 points were exact depression.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
