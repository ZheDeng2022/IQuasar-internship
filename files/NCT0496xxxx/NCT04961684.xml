  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The efficacy and safety of Solver Pen (prototype number X92001704) is evaluated in this&#xD;
      randomized, open label, controlled, investigator-blinded, comparative clinical trial in 76&#xD;
      patients. Subjects are treated with either the test medical device (Solver Pen) or the&#xD;
      comparator (Loceryl, 5% amorolfine), respectively, for a period of 90 days. The primary&#xD;
      objective of the investigation is the increase of percentage of healthy surface on the great&#xD;
      toenail at study end versus baseline, as evaluated by a blinded investigator. Patients are&#xD;
      followed up for a period of 90 days, with visits at D0 (baseline), D30, D60 and D90,&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
