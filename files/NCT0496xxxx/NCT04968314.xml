    <textblock>
      Purpose of this study is to assess the prevalence of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and&#xD;
      positive childhood experiences (PCEs) among parents enrolled in the Chicago Parent Program&#xD;
      (ChiPP) in their child's school and whether those experiences are associated with a) parents'&#xD;
      participation in ChiPP and b) program benefits for parents and children.&#xD;

      Purpose of this study is to assess the prevalence of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and&#xD;
      positive childhood experiences (PCEs) among parents enrolled in the Chicago Parent Program&#xD;
      (ChiPP) in their child's school and whether those experiences are associated with a) parents'&#xD;
      participation in ChiPP and b) program benefits for parents and children. Parents who enroll&#xD;
      in ChiPP groups in their child school are eligible to participate in this study. Data on&#xD;
      ACEs, and PCEs are collected at baseline. Parent perceptions of their children's behavior&#xD;
      problems and their engagement in early learning are collected at baseline and&#xD;
      post-intervention data. Parent satisfaction with ChiPP and their sense of connection with&#xD;
      other parents in their ChiPP group are measured at post-intervention only.&#xD;

    <description>number of adverse childhood experiences during parent's first 18 years of life assessed by parent report using the Philadelphia ACEs measure. Number of adverse childhood experiences assessed at baseline only. Includes two sub scales: the Conventional ACE sub scale (15 items measuring adversities in one's home) and the Expanded ACE sub scale (6 items measuring adversities in one's community). Scores can range from 0-21. Higher scores indicate more exposures to childhood adversity</description>

    <measure>Parent Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>immediately after the intervention, approximately 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Parent's satisfaction with the Chicago Parent Program intervention as assessed at post-intervention only and measured using the Chicago Parent Program Parent Satisfaction Form. Measure includes 19 items assessing the extent to which they and their child benefitted from the program (scored on a Likert-type scale), aspects of the program that were most and least beneficial, and the extent to which they would recommend the program to other parents. Each item is scored and interpreted separately.</description>

    <time_frame>immediately after the intervention, approximately 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>parent-reported Likert-type measure of the extent to which parents developed a sense of connection and belonging with the other parents in the Chicago Parent Program intervention group. Measured using the 25-item Intervention Group Environment Scale and items are measured along a 5-point continuum of strongly disagree to strongly agree. Includes 3 sub scales measuring sense of belonging, quality of the group facilitation, and conflicts among members within the group. Scores can range from 0-5 with higher scores indicating greater social connectedness.</description>

    <measure>Parent engagement in early learning-Teacher Report</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline to immediately after the intervention, approximately 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measures teacher's perspective on the extent to which parents are engaged in their child's learning. Measured using a teacher-report measure (Teacher-Reported Parent Engagement in Child's Education) adapted from Fast Track measure of parent engagement. Teacher-Reported Parent Engagement in Child's Education includes 5 items assessed rated on a Likert-type scale; scores can range from 5-25 with higher scores indicating greater parent engagement from the perspective of the teacher. Measure completed by teachers.</description>

    <time_frame>change from baseline to immediately after the intervention, approximately 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measures the extent to which parents perceive they are engaged in their child's learning. Measured using the Parent Engagement in Early Childhood Education (PEECE) Survey. The PEECE Survey includes 25 items rated on a Likert-type scale. Scores can range from 25-100 with higher scores indicating greater engagement in their child's education.</description>

    <measure>Quality of parent participation in the intervention group</measure>
    <time_frame>immediately after the intervention, approximately 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>quality of each parent's participation in the Chicago Parent Program group sessions is assessed by group leaders using the Parent Engagement Rating Scale. This is a 7-item, 4-point Likert-type scale that assesses the extent to which the parent was actively engaged in the group sessions. Scores can range from 7-28 with higher scores indicating greater parent engagement and higher quality of participation in the group sessions.</description>
