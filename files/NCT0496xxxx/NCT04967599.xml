  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary pathway of alcohol metabolism involves two main enzymes, alcohol and aldehyde&#xD;
      dehydrogenase. Several genes (ALDH2, ADH1B) that encode these enzymes have variants that&#xD;
      alter the rate of alcohol metabolism and increase levels of acetaldehyde. The variant ALDH2*2&#xD;
      allele is associated with the flushing response (i.e., Asian glow) and is found almost&#xD;
      exclusively in individuals of east Asian descent. Although having variant ALDH2 and ADH1B&#xD;
      alleles is protective against heavy drinking and alcohol use disorders, for those who do&#xD;
      drink, these variants also are associated with elevations in risk for several health&#xD;
      problems. The premise of this study is that we can affect early drinking behavior through&#xD;
      personalized communication about these health-related risks.&#xD;
