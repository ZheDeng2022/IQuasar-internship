      This multicenter, open-label, randomized phase 3 trial will determine if palbociclib and&#xD;
      cetuximab (Arm 1) improves overall survival (OS) in comparison to cetuximab monotherapy (Arm&#xD;
      2) in patients with CDKN2A-altered, HPV-unrelated recurrent or metastatic head and neck&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) who experienced disease progression on a PD-1/L1 inhibitor&#xD;
      (given as monotherapy or in combination with other therapy).&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>These patients will be randomized on a 2:1 basis to Arm 1 (palbociclib + cetuximab, n=54) or Arm 2 (cetuximab alone, n=27). Patients will be stratified at randomization to balance the proportion of patients in each arm with:&#xD;
previous exposure to a platinum agent (cisplatin or carboplatin given to treat recurrent or metastatic disease, or as a component of multimodality therapy for newly diagnosed locally advanced, non-metastatic HNSCC),&#xD;

             dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥ 10 mm with CT scan, as ≥ 20 mm by&#xD;
             chest x-ray, or ≥ 10 mm with calipers by clinical exam, per RECIST 1.1.&#xD;

             progression for at least 4 weeks after CNS-directed treatment, as ascertained by&#xD;
             clinical examination and brain imaging (MRI or CT scan) during the screening period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or&#xD;
             biologic composition to palbociclib or other agents used in the study (excluding&#xD;

             prior to registration. Concurrent treatment with effective ART according to DHHS&#xD;
             treatment guidelines is recommended. Recommend exclusion of specific ART agents based&#xD;
             on predicted drug-drug interactions (i.e. for sensitive CYP3A4 substrates, concurrent&#xD;
