  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Targeting human epidermal factor receptor 2 (HER2) therapy have shown the anti-tumor efficacy&#xD;
      in patients with HER2-positive gastrointestinal tumors. Pyrotinib is an irreversible&#xD;
      small-molecule receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting both epidermal growth factor&#xD;
      receptor (EGFR) and HER2. This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      Pyrotinib in patients with HER2 positive gastrointestinal tumors.&#xD;

      This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Pyrotinib in patients with HER2&#xD;
      positive gastrointestinal tumors. Three cohorts were designed for this trial. Cohort 1:&#xD;
      patients with gastric cancer or esophageal adenocarcinoma receiving paclitaxel combined with&#xD;
      pyrotinib for second-line therapy; Cohort 2: patients with gastric cancer or esophageal&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma receiving pyrotinib monotherapy for third-line or posterior line therapy;&#xD;
      Cohort 3: patients with colorectal cancer receiving pyrotinib combined with/without&#xD;
      trastuzumab for third-line or posterior line therapy.&#xD;
