  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aortic dissection is a life-threatening condition and a consequence of a tear of the&#xD;
      innermost of the three aortic layers- the intima. When a tear occurs, blood surges through&#xD;
      the tear and causes the flow of blood between the aortic layers, causing a &quot;false lumen&quot;.&#xD;
      This causes a weakening of the aortic wall and hinders the blood from reaching its target&#xD;
      organs and life saving emergent surgery is performed as routine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 20% of patients undergoing acute type a aortic dissection (ATAAD) surgery&#xD;
      suffer from postoperative neurological injuries and It has been demonstrated that&#xD;
      neurological injuries account for 10-15% of in-hospital deaths.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In association with other cardiac procedures where the left side of the heart is opened and&#xD;
      air may be trapped within the arterial circulation, carbon dioxide flooding is used to&#xD;
      displace open air from the surgical wound. In comparison to air, carbon dioxide is&#xD;
      significantly more soluble in blood and may therefore decrease the risk of air embolism. In&#xD;
      cardiac surgery, carbon dioxide flooding has been demonstrated to reduce levels of biomarkers&#xD;
      of cerebral injury, but carbon dioxide is not routinely employed in ATAAD surgery and has not&#xD;
      been studied in association with these procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that carbon dioxide flooding reduces cerebral air embolism and the aim of&#xD;
      thos project is to evaluate whether carbon dioxide flooding may reduce neurological injuries&#xD;
      following ATAAD surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, patient- and reviewer blinded interventional&#xD;
      study. Patients will be randomised to undergo surgery with carbon-dioxide flooding at 5L/min&#xD;
      to the open chest cavity or conventional surgery without carbon dioxide flooding. Remaining&#xD;
      aspects of the procedure will be identical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient, external statistician and the reviewer analyzing the primary endpoints will be&#xD;
      blinded for the randomization arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will assess the following endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes: Presence, number and volume of ischaemic lesions observed using magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI) after ATAAD surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes: Clinical signs of neurological injury. Levels of biomarkers of&#xD;
      neurological injury (S100B, neuron specific enolase (NSE) , neurofilament protein (NFL),&#xD;
      Glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) , Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1) and&#xD;
      Tau-protein (TAU)) before and after surgery. Quality of life, postoperative recovery and&#xD;
      neurological function after ATAAD surgery. Primary outcomes in relation to retrograde&#xD;
      cerebral perfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Start of inclusion is anticipated to start Sep 1st, 202. The writing of a manuscript&#xD;
      describing the study methods and study objectives is expected to be started in 2021 and the&#xD;
      final manuscript is expected to be written during 2025.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interim analysis of the primary endpoints and the safety arm will be performed after 20&#xD;
      patients have been included in each arm. An external statistician together with the principle&#xD;
      investigator will hereafter decide for the study to be continued or terminated due to harms,&#xD;
      futility or superiority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety arm will include intraoperative mortality, in-hospital mortality, re-operation for&#xD;
      bleeding, stroke, myocardial infarction or other thromboembolic events.&#xD;
