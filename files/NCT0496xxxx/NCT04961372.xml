      The aim of our study is to investigate the presence of depression, anxiety and fear in&#xD;
      healthcare workers during the SARS-CoV2 pandemic process, to evaluate their work and social&#xD;
      life situations, as well as to evaluate the perspectives of the entire population towards&#xD;
      hospital admission, surgery decision and vaccination.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV2) was detected by the Chinese&#xD;
      Center for Disease Control and Prevention on 7 January 2020 in a patient with atypical&#xD;
      pneumonia in Wuhan, China, via a nasopharyngeal swab. On March 11, 2020, the World Health&#xD;
      Organization declared it a &quot;Pandemic&quot;. SARS-CoV2 quickly turned into a global epidemic, with&#xD;
      a total of 134,957,021 confirmed cases and 2,918,752 deaths reported in April 2021.Since&#xD;
      SARS-CoV2 is a highly contagious disease, the risk of infection in healthcare workers is&#xD;
      quite high. In one of the earliest studies in Wuhan, 29 percent of patients (40 out of 138)&#xD;
      were reported to be healthcare workers. A report from the American Centers for Disease&#xD;
      Control and Prevention (CDC) stated that a total of 9,282 healthcare workers were diagnosed&#xD;
      with COVID-19, including 27 deaths, between February 12 and April 9, 2020. Eleven to nineteen&#xD;
      percent of COVID-19 cases have been identified as healthcare professionals.As the&#xD;
      investigators have seen in studies of SARS or Ebola outbreaks, the sudden onset of an&#xD;
      immediately life-threatening epidemic can place an extraordinary amount of pressure on&#xD;
      healthcare workers. Increased workload, physical fatigue, inadequate personal equipment,&#xD;
      nosocomial transmission, and having to make ethically difficult decisions can have dramatic&#xD;
      effects on their physical and mental health. The weight of working conditions together with&#xD;
      the risk of illness of their social environment and families can cause mental health problems&#xD;
      such as fear and anxiety in healthcare workers.When an effective vaccination program is in&#xD;
      place, population uptake should be as high as possible to achieve herd immunity. Vaccination&#xD;
      hesitancy, defined as a delay in acceptance or rejection of vaccination despite the&#xD;
      availability of vaccination services, is one of the barriers to this. It is a complex special&#xD;
      case that varies with time, place, and vaccines. It is influenced by factors such as peace of&#xD;
      mind, convenience, and trust. Vaccine hesitations have been identified as one of the ten&#xD;
      global health threats of 2019.The aim of our study is to investigate the presence of&#xD;
      depression, anxiety and fear in healthcare workers during the SARS-CoV2 pandemic process, to&#xD;
      evaluate their work and social life situations, as well as to evaluate the perspectives of&#xD;
      the entire population towards hospital admission, surgery decision and vaccination.&#xD;
