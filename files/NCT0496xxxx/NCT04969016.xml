      INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liquid skin adhesive (LSA) has benefits over other closure methods. Especially it is less&#xD;
      invasive, quicker to apply, and better in cosmesis. Also LSA applied wounds need no post-care&#xD;
      and its water-proof nature allows patients to take a shower immediate postoperative periods.&#xD;
      While traditional sutures and skin staples are invasive and have infection chance requiring&#xD;
      regular wound dressings, LSA is resistant against both water and microbial infection without&#xD;
      need for postoperative dressings. Thus LSA-applied wounds need no professional care saving&#xD;
      wound management cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study investigated not only the safety and efficacy of LSA, but also the&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness in the context of total wound management resources including man-power,&#xD;
      time, and cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY OBJECTIVE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary end point of this study is time requiring to manage surgical wound calculated as man&#xD;
      hour. Secondary end points are wound related complication and cost for management of surgical&#xD;
      wound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target number of the enrollment were calculated under the hypothesis that the wound&#xD;
      management time for stapler group would be 1560 sec and that for LSA group be 264 sec with&#xD;
      10% drop-out rate. The sample number calculation formula of the t-test for independent 2&#xD;
      groups were used. For two-sided validation with the significance level of 0.05, and the power&#xD;
      of 0.8, 29 patients for each group were estimated.&#xD;

      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screening: replaced with preoperative examination&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  chest X-ray, CBC, CEA, BUN/Cr, OT/PT, glucose, EKG, abdominopelvic CT (optional),&#xD;
                chest CT (optional), PET-CT(optional), MRI(optional)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Subject&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Experimental group: surgical wound closure with liquid skin adhesive&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Control group: surgical wound closure with stapler&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Randomization The patients were randomized just before surgery after anesthesia and were&#xD;
           randomly assigned to either experimental or control group as to computer-generated&#xD;
           random number in 1:1 manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Study schedule&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The enrolled patients received an elective surgery within 30 days after screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Surgical wound managers checked every enrolled patient from immediate postoperative&#xD;
                period until discharge at least 1 time per day. Surgical wound managers were either&#xD;
                surgical hospitalists (general surgery boards), surgical residents, or wound care&#xD;
                specialist nurses. Incompletely healed wounds until discharge were managed&#xD;
                regularly in out-patient clinics additionally. If wound complications were noted at&#xD;
                any time point, standard treatment was given according to the patient's status&#xD;
                regardless of assigned groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Wound management&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Wound healing time was defined as the time period from the moment of skin closure&#xD;
                to the point when a surgical wound manager declared that the wound was healed&#xD;
                either during admission or in out-patient clinic. For LSA group, wound closure time&#xD;
                was measured in second starting from when LiquiBand速 was applied to the first skin&#xD;
                incision to when LiquiBand速 was completely dried up in all skin incisions. For&#xD;
                stapler group, it was measured as the whole time in second spent to apply skin&#xD;
                staplers to all skin incisions in about 1cm interval without any dehiscence.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Surgical wound management was performed at least once a day in all patients. Wound&#xD;
                management time was measured when surgical wound manager inspected and performed&#xD;
                wound dressing as required. It was defined as time in second starting from the&#xD;
                moment a patient completely took off tops to the moment a surgical wound manager&#xD;
                took off gloves on the completion of dressing.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The complete wound healing was declared by surgical wound managers for wounds that&#xD;
                have injections less than 2mm, no skin color change on the edges, no dehiscence on&#xD;
                the inspection under white light.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Wound management time and cost were analyzed separately for event places (during&#xD;
                admission - and out-patient clinic). Wound management time was compensated as to&#xD;
                surgical wound managers and converted in to man-hour. The compensation constant was&#xD;
                defined to reduce bias by performer assuming the skill level of wound management&#xD;
                was different among surgical wound managers. The surgical hospitalists who were&#xD;
                general surgery boards were found to be the most skillful, therefore the constant&#xD;
                for them was defined as 1. The constants for surgical residents and wound care&#xD;
                specialist nurses were defined as 0.6 and 0.8 respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The total wound management cost included dressing fee and material cost. Generally,&#xD;
                for normal wounds, adhesive foam dressings were used and for complicated wounds,&#xD;
                gauzes and vicryl sutures were used as necessary. In Korean National Insurance&#xD;
                System, dressing material costs were classified as the benefit service charge which&#xD;
                was reimbursed by National Health Insurance Cooperation (NHIC) and the non-benefit&#xD;
                service charge which a patient should pay all. Every dressing material was check&#xD;
                whether the benefit service or the non-benefit service and the cost was recorded&#xD;
                accordingly.&#xD;
