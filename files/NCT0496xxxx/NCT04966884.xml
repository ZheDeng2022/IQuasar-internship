      Anti-melanoma differentiation-associated gene5 (Anti-MDA5) antibody positive Dermatomyositis&#xD;
      (DM) is a subtype of DM that is more frequent in East Asia, which is often exhibit skin&#xD;
      lesion, clinically amyopathic and interstitial lung disease. About 42%-100% of patients with&#xD;
      Anti-MDA5+ DM develop rapidly progressive interstitial lung disease (RPILD) and result in&#xD;
      respiratory failure. The mortality is as high as 40% within 6 months. In addition, not every&#xD;
      patient with Anti-MDA5+ DM respond to traditional treatment strategy and most of the patients&#xD;
      are resistant to immunosuppressive therapy including a combination of high dose&#xD;
      glucocorticoids (GCs) and immunosuppressants such as cyclosporine, tacrolimus, or&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide. However, RP-ILD is still the main cause of death due to fatal respiratory&#xD;
      failure. Therefore, treatment of Anti-MDA5+ DM patients is challenging.Blocking multiple&#xD;
      cytokines may become a new target for the treatment of this disease.Jakinibs is a Janus&#xD;
      kinase (JAK) inhibitor that blocks a variety of cytokines, such as type I and type II&#xD;
      interferon. Few studies have reported a positive response to JAK inhibitor for Anti-MDA5+ DM.&#xD;
      Kazuhiro et al. reported in 2018 that JAK inhibitor tofacitinib may be an effective treatment&#xD;
      option for high risk amyopathic dermatomyositis (ADM) -ILD patients after failure of&#xD;
      conventional treatment, but the number of cases is too small. And a recent paper showed that&#xD;
      great efficacy of tofacitinib for the improvement of survival of anti-MDA5-positive&#xD;
      early-stage ADM-ILD patients.The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      JAK inhibitors in the treatment of anti-MDA5+ DM patients, and to evaluate the effect of JAK&#xD;
      inhibitors on B cells of these patients, so as to provide a new target and theoretical basis&#xD;
      for the treatment of anti-MDA5+ DM.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dermatomyositis (DM) is an idiopathic inflammatory myopathy characterized by chronic&#xD;
      inflammation in the skin and muscle. Anti-melanoma differentiation-associated gene5&#xD;
      (Anti-MDA5) antibody positive DM is a subtype of DM that is more frequent in East Asia, which&#xD;
      is often exhibit skin lesion, clinically amyopathic and interstitial lung disease. About&#xD;
      42%-100% of patients with Anti-MDA5+ DM develop rapidly progressive interstitial lung disease&#xD;
      (RPILD) and result in respiratory failure. The mortality is as high as 40% within 6 months.&#xD;
      In addition, not every patient with Anti-MDA5+ DM respond to traditional treatment strategy&#xD;
      and most of the patients are resistant to immunosuppressive therapy including a combination&#xD;
      of high dose glucocorticoids(GCs) and immunosuppressants such as cyclosporine, tacrolimus, or&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide. However, RP-ILD is still the main cause of death due to fatal respiratory&#xD;
      failure. Therefore, treatment of Anti-MDA5+ DM patients is challenging.The excessive&#xD;
      production of multiple cytokines plays a crucial role in the development of Anti-MDA5+ DM&#xD;
      patients complicated with ILD. Hyperferritinemia is a predictor of poor prognosis. Other&#xD;
      abnormalities included lymphopenia, increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate(ESR), and&#xD;
      elevated serum interleukin-18 (IL-18).Moreover, compared with Anti-MDA5- DM patients, serum&#xD;
      interferon--α(IFN-α) concentration increased in Anti-MDA5+ DM patients with RP-ILD.&#xD;
      Therefore, blocking multiple cytokines may become a new target for the treatment of this&#xD;
      disease.Jakinibs is a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor that blocks a variety of cytokines, such&#xD;
      as type I and type II IFN. Few studies have reported a positive response to JAK inhibitor for&#xD;
      Anti-MDA5+ DM. Kazuhiro et al. reported in 2018 that JAK inhibitor tofacitinib may be an&#xD;
      effective treatment option for high risk amyopathic dermatomyositis (ADM) -ILD patients after&#xD;
      failure of conventional treatment, but the number of cases is too small. And a recent paper&#xD;
      showed that great efficacy of tofacitinib for the improvement of survival of&#xD;
      anti-MDA5-positive early-stage ADM-ILD patients.The aim of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of JAK inhibitors in the treatment of anti-MDA5+ DM patients, and to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of JAK inhibitors on B cells of these patients, so as to provide a new&#xD;
      target and theoretical basis for the treatment of anti-MDA5+ DM.This was a single-arm&#xD;
      open-label pilot observational study. Patients were received a glucocorticoids&#xD;
      (0.8mg-1mg/kg/day) and a combination with tofacitinib (at a dose of 5 mg twice daily).&#xD;
      Inactive disease was defined as meeting the following three criteria: CK≤200U/L, physician&#xD;
      visual analogue scale(VAS) =0, and myositis disease activity assessment visual analog scales&#xD;
      (MYOACT) scores =0. Otherwise, the disease condition was considered to be active.The primary&#xD;
      endpoint was the number of responders by total improvement score (TIS) ,which defined&#xD;
      according to 2016 American College of Rheumatology(ACR)-European League Against&#xD;
      Rheumatism(EULAR) Criteria for clinical response for adult DM/polymyositis(PM), after&#xD;
      treatment with tofacitinib for 12 months. A TIS (0-100), determined by summing scores in each&#xD;
      International Myositis Assessment and Clinical Studies Group (IMACS) core set measures (CSM).&#xD;
      Thresholds for minimal, moderate, and major improvement were ≥20, ≥40, and ≥60 points in the&#xD;
      TIS. Secondary endpoints included safety measures and change from baseline in the following&#xD;
      index: percentage of predicted FVC (FVC % predicted) and percentage of predicted DLCO (DLCO%&#xD;
      predicted), the ferritin level, peripheral lymphocyte subsets.&#xD;
