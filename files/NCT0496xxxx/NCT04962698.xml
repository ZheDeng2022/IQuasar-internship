  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will develop and test a new paradigm of motor imagery for facilitating&#xD;
      neuromotor excitability and performance of distal muscles in the upper limb by adopting a&#xD;
      robotic prosthesis and integrating proven procedures for neuromotor facilitation. The&#xD;
      scientific purpose of the study is to understand the effect of controlling a detached robotic&#xD;
      prosthesis with proximal muscle activation on brain excitability of the resting arm muscles&#xD;
      as well as reaction time. The efficacy of this task will be understood by comparing with&#xD;
      other task conditions (motor imagery only, EMG visual feedback only, 2D visual feedback on a&#xD;
      monitor, etc.) that do not involve the robotic prosthesis. The test of the developed system&#xD;
      will be performed in healthy able-bodied adults. The feasibility of the system will be&#xD;
      examined in post-stroke adults.&#xD;

      This study consists of experiments on two non-consecutive days in the Human Neuromuscular&#xD;
      Physiology Laboratory located in the Biological Sciences/Applied Physiology Building of&#xD;
      Georgia Tech. If subjects qualify and agree to take part in this study, subjects will be&#xD;
      asked to read and sign the consent form. The whole procedure will last about 3 hours per day,&#xD;
      including preparation. Subjects will come to the lab on two separate days on the same tasks.&#xD;
      The first day will serve as familiarization with the same tasks as the second day. Subjects&#xD;
      will perform the following experiment. Individuals will sit upright and relax their hands and&#xD;
      shoulders. The right shoulder will be fixed with pads to the upper arm to prevent shoulder&#xD;
      flexion/extension movement. The right hand and forearm will be rested on a plate hidden below&#xD;
      a table. The robotic prosthesis will be placed on the table as one would normally place own&#xD;
      arm on the table. There will be no physical connection between the hand and the robotic&#xD;
      prosthesis. Subjects will activate a pair of the front portion of the shoulder muscles and&#xD;
      the upper part of the chest muscles for making a grasping movement of the robotic prosthesis.&#xD;
      For making a releasing movement of the prosthesis, subjects will activate a pair of the back&#xD;
      portion of the shoulder muscles and the back muscles. Muscle activity will be recorded with&#xD;
      two small sensors on each muscle. Subjects will practice the activation of each muscle pair&#xD;
      while watching the signal on a monitor. In each pair, a clearer signal will be used for&#xD;
      controlling the robotic digits. Healthy subjects only: Healthy subjects will perform the&#xD;
      following tasks A-F. [A: Rest] Subjects will relax the muscles without physical or cognitive&#xD;
      effort while gazing at the turned-off monitor. [B: Robotic action observation] Subjects will&#xD;
      relax the muscles and focus on observing the computer-controlled grasp and release actions (2&#xD;
      s in each movement) of the robotic prosthesis. [C: Visual MI] Subjects will relax the muscles&#xD;
      and perform conventional visual mental imagery (MI). With the guidance of audio instruction,&#xD;
      the subjects will imagine the grasp and release motions with the right arm for 2 s in each&#xD;
      motion in their mind. There will be no proximal muscle contraction. [D: Kinesthetic MI] The&#xD;
      same MI procedure as Task C will be performed, except that the subjects will focus on the&#xD;
      kinesthetic sensation that was felt with the imagined motions. [E: Robotically augmented&#xD;
      practice (see below detailed description)] Subjects will perform robotically augmented mental&#xD;
      practice for grasp and release motions with the activation control of the proximal muscles.&#xD;
      During this task, subjects will also imagine the kinesthetic sensation that was felt with the&#xD;
      corresponding motions with the right arm. [F: Proximal muscle contraction with visual&#xD;
      feedback of a virtual robot] Subjects will perform Task E with visual feedback of virtual&#xD;
      robot actions in 2D on a monitor. [G: Robotically augmented practice without MI] Subjects&#xD;
      will perform Task E without MI. As a reaction task, subjects will flex the index finger as&#xD;
      soon as they hear an auditory cue. Post-stroke subjects only: Tasks C [Visual MI], E&#xD;
      [Robotically augmented mental practice], and A [Rest] above will be performed by post-stroke&#xD;
      subjects with right-side hemiparesis who can volitionally activate fingers and proximal&#xD;
      muscles. As a reaction task, subjects will flex the index finger as soon as an auditory cue&#xD;
      is heard. TMS (both healthy and post-stroke subjects): During the above-mentioned tasks,&#xD;
      brain stimulation (called TMS) will be applied over the motor cortex in the left hemisphere.&#xD;
      The TMS procedure will follow the one used in the previous studies by the investigators. A&#xD;
      TMS coil will be placed over a precise point on the scalp where the investigators will&#xD;
      stimulate the brain to make the muscle move. The investigators will tell the subject when the&#xD;
      stimulation portion of the procedure is about to begin. The first part of the procedure will&#xD;
      be to find the area of the brain that controls muscles. These investigators will position the&#xD;
      TMS coil on the head and will give the subject a series of stimulations (called magnetic&#xD;
      pulses). Once the spot that controls the muscles is identified, the investigators will find&#xD;
      the least amount of stimulation needed to activate the resting muscles. The second part of&#xD;
      the procedure will be to evoke muscle contraction with TMS at rest and during the tasks&#xD;
      described above. The investigators will apply single-pulse and paired-pulse TMS with 5-second&#xD;
      intervals or more. Robotically augmented practice (Task E and F above): An individual will&#xD;
      use proximal muscle contractions to flex and extend the robotic prosthesis digits for&#xD;
      performing a grasp-release task. 1) Grasp. The individual will activate the proximal muscles&#xD;
      as if for a retrieving motion (the back portion of the shoulder muscles and the back muscles)&#xD;
      for 2 s. This muscle activation controls the prosthesis to flex the digits to grasp a&#xD;
      cylinder-shaped object. 2) Release. The individual will relax the above-activated proximal&#xD;
      muscles and activate the proximal muscles as if for a reaching motion (the front portion of&#xD;
      the shoulder muscles and the top portion of the chest muscles) for 2 s. This muscle&#xD;
      activation controls the prosthesis to extend the digits to release the object. After&#xD;
      releasing the object, the individual will relax the proximal muscles. The individual will&#xD;
      repeat this sequence while observing and hearing the actions of the prosthesis. The&#xD;
      acceleration signal will be used to determine the slight displacement of the upper arm. EMG&#xD;
      of forearm and hand muscles will be monitored to ensure that those muscles are relaxed during&#xD;
      proximal muscle activation.&#xD;
