      This report was an effective evaluation of using multimedia educational program for self-care&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In a systematic review, evaluated the effectiveness of multimedia education program (MLEP)&#xD;
      and confirmed that MLEP reduced cost significantly and improved patient participation in&#xD;
      enterostomy care and self-care ability. However, research was insufficient for whether a&#xD;
      multimedia education program (MLEP) interventions can improve patient self-care and quality&#xD;
      of life.&#xD;

    <description>Assessment scale of self-care ability of enterostomy care was a quantitative scale for nursing staff to evaluate self-care skills in patients with enterostomy. It consisted of 7 items related to: Prepare items, removing the pouching system, measuring the enterostomy diameter, adjusting the size of the enterostomy diameter in a new stoma appliance, skin care, fitting a new enterostomy appliance, and emptying procedure. Each skill was rated on a 4-point scale: Likert scale (1: not at all, 2: some, 3: quite a lot, 4: very much).&#xD;
Higher scores indicated that patient had a higher level of self-care skills for changing enterostomy pouching system</description>
