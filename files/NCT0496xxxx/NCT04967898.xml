      This study will be a randomized clinical trial. the study will be conducted in Mubarak&#xD;
      Hospital Sargodha. a sample size of 44 subjects will be taken. subjects will be divided into&#xD;
      two groups using the lottery method. group 1 will be treated with Bowen technique along with&#xD;
      heating pad and group 2 will be treated with sustained stretching technique along with&#xD;
      heating pads thrice a week for 3 weeks. subjects will come after 1 month for follow up. the&#xD;
      follow-up will show which technique is more effective in improving hamstring flexibility and&#xD;
      range in healthy females. the outcome measures active knee extension test and sit and reach&#xD;
      test will be used to check hamstring flexibility and range at baseline, post-treatment, and&#xD;
      follow-up. data were analyzed using spss 26.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      hamstring muscles are responsible for hip and knee movement during walking, running,&#xD;
      squatting, bending knees, and pelvis tilting. hamstring muscles function is to perform&#xD;
      flexion at knee and hip extension. hamstring tightness is more common in females than males.&#xD;
      once the hamstring were tightened ,incidence of low back pain rose to 15%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      hamstring shortening occurred due to maintain same posture for prolong period of time,&#xD;
      fatigue, sedentary life style, and poor body mechanics. hamstring tightness can disturb the&#xD;
      biomechanics of low back and pelvis in each adolescents and adult. most of the individuals&#xD;
      with hamstring tightness were asymptomatic. Throughout daily activities, nerves that&#xD;
      innervate the hamstring muscle is exposed to constant pressure throughout sitting, standing&#xD;
      can cause hamstring tightness.. Nerve adhesions inside the hamstring may alter neurodynamic&#xD;
      inflicting abnormal machan-o-sensitivity of the nerve that will influence hamstring&#xD;
      flexibility. This machan-o-sensitivity of the neural tissue could limit hamstring length in&#xD;
      traditional healthy people. Shortened hamstrings amendment the curvature of the spine&#xD;
      inflicting larger compression masses within the mesial curvatures and increase in intradiscal&#xD;
      pressure and also the incidence of larger shear forces, thereby predisposing people to spinal&#xD;
      issues various techniques were used to treat hamstring tightness. this study we compare the&#xD;
      effects of Bowen technique and sustained stretching on hamstring flexibility in asymptomatic&#xD;
      females.&#xD;
&#xD;
      group 1 will be treated with Bowen technique .this is a soft tissue mobilization technique&#xD;
      This medical care involves short mild rolling moves over the muscles, nerve, ligaments and&#xD;
      tendons of flesh utilizing the hands, fingers and thumb. Sequence of receiving bilateral&#xD;
      rolling moves over segments of the erector spinae from the lumber toward cervical spine,&#xD;
      latissimus dorsi, the gluteal, the hamstring muscles proximally and distally, tensor facia&#xD;
      Lata and a medial hip striated muscle move. Treatment will be given thrice a week for 3&#xD;
      weeks. and treatment session will be 20minutes for each leg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      group 2 will be treated with sustained stretching technique. Sustained stretching is most&#xD;
      common and safest technique used for hamstring tightness. This sort of stretch is applied&#xD;
      slowly and bit by bit at a comparatively constant force to avoid eliciting a inborn reflex.&#xD;
      The resultant increase in muscle length is said to elastic behavior. Static stretch of thirty&#xD;
      seconds at a frequency of 3 continual stretches per single session is ample to extend muscle&#xD;
      length. treatment will be given thrice a week for 3 weeks. Treatment session will be 30&#xD;
      seconds for each leg. both groups will come after 1 month for follow up. Outcome measure&#xD;
      active knee test and sit and reach test will be used to check hamstring flexibility and range&#xD;
      in asymptomatic females at baseline, post-treatment and follow up. the goal of this study is&#xD;
      to improve hamstring flexibility in asymptomatic females.&#xD;
&#xD;
      active knee extension test and sit and reach test will be used to check hamstring flexibility&#xD;
      and range in subjects. these both tests have very high reliability and validity. There is a&#xD;
      lack of evidence demonstrating the effects of Bowen technique and sustained stretching on&#xD;
      hamstring flexibility. the purpose of this study is to compare the effects of both techniques&#xD;
      to assess which technique has more clinical impact than other.&#xD;
