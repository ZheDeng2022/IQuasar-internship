      The patients were divided into two groups, one group was a suspected hip joint anterior&#xD;
      superior labrum tear, and the other group was a non-hip joint disease. The patients received&#xD;
      conventional ultrasound diagnosis of the hip joint, contrast-enhanced ultrasound, and&#xD;
      high-resolution single hip MRI for surgery Perform diagnostic power test for the gold&#xD;

      The patients were divided into two groups, one group was patients with suspected anterior&#xD;
      superior labrum tear, and the other group was patients with non-hip joint diseases. Routine&#xD;
      ultrasound diagnosis of the hip, contrast-enhanced ultrasound, and high-resolution single hip&#xD;
      MRI were performed. For patients undergoing hip arthroscopic surgery after diagnostic&#xD;
      occlusive treatment, the results of arthroscopic exploration are used as the diagnostic gold&#xD;
      standard. A tear detected during the operation was judged to be positive, and a tear not&#xD;
      detected was judged to be negative. For patients who have not undergone hip arthroscopic&#xD;
      surgery after the closure treatment, if the MRI of the hip is performed, the MRI result is&#xD;
      the gold standard. The diagnosis of tearing was judged as positive, and the undiagnosed&#xD;
      tearing was judged as negative. This study was used to compare (1) the diagnostic efficacy of&#xD;
      hip joint contrast-enhanced ultrasound and high-resolution single hip MRI in patients with&#xD;
      suspected anterior superior labrum tear. (2) Comparison of the diagnostic efficiency of&#xD;
      contrast-enhanced hip joint ultrasound and conventional ultrasound in patients with suspected&#xD;
      anterior superior labrum tear. (3) In the process of judging the hip joint anterior superior&#xD;
      labrum tear by conventional ultrasound and contrast-enhanced ultrasound of the hip joint, the&#xD;
      consistency of repeated readings and the comparison of the consistency between readers.&#xD;
