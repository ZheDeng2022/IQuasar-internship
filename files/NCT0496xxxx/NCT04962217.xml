      As a result of a randomized controlled trial (NCT02985047) BA is continuously offered to&#xD;
      persons with self-harm at risk for suicide in Skåne, Sweden. This qualitative inductive study&#xD;
      aims to provide experiences among family members, carers and significant others of Brief&#xD;
      Admission by self-referral for self-harming and suicidal persons based on individual&#xD;
      semi-structured interviews. Participants will be identified through suggestion from persons&#xD;
      with an active BA contract. Interviews, estimated to last 30-60 minutes, will be analyzed by&#xD;
      a phenomenological hermeneutic method or by content analysis depending on richness and depth&#xD;
      in the interviews. Findings from this study will be published.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As a result of the randomized controlled trial evaluating BA in Skåne (NCT02985047), BA is&#xD;
      since January 2019, continuously offered to persons with self-harm at risk for suicide in&#xD;
      Skåne, Sweden. Parallel to the clinical trial qualitative interview studies have been&#xD;
      performed on the experiences of BA, with participants during the pilot phase of the trial and&#xD;
      among the most severely ill persons and from the viewpoint of psychiatric staff. The present&#xD;
      study aims to complement the above-mentioned studies with analysis of real-life experiences&#xD;
      of BA from the perspective of loved ones to persons with current access to BA. This is&#xD;
      important since the persons close to those suffering from recurrent self-harm and suicidal&#xD;
      ideation play an essential role in times of crisis and may beneficially contribute to&#xD;
      motivation as well as effects of provided care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this qualitative inductive study individual semi-structured interviews will be held with&#xD;
      family members, carers and significant others of persons with an active BA contract, who has&#xD;
      given informed consent to participate. To identify potential informants, persons with an&#xD;
      active BA contract, who have used BA within the last three months, at the wards in Lund,&#xD;
      Malmö, Helsingborg or Kristianstad will be contacted and asked about contact information&#xD;
      (name and telephone number) to a person close to them who may be contacted regarding&#xD;
      inclusion in the present study. A variation of contract length (minimum one month since first&#xD;
      signed contract) is strived for. The number of interviews will depend on the number of active&#xD;
      contracts at the included wards and the proportion of those where potential participants may&#xD;
      be contacted and who subsequently consent to participate, but with a maximum of 25&#xD;
      interviews. Interviews are estimated to be 30-60 minutes, and will be conducted in a calm&#xD;
      place, chosen by the participant. Interviews will be performed by doctoral students in&#xD;
      psychiatry and supervised by a senior researcher with experience of psychiatry and&#xD;
      qualitative research. Interviews will be transcribed and analyzed by a phenomenological&#xD;
      hermeneutic method or by content analysis depending on richness and depth in the interviews.&#xD;
      Findings from this study will be published.&#xD;
