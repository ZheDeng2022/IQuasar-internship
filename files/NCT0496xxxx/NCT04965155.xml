  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label phase II study designed to assess the efficacy and safety of the&#xD;
      combination isatuximab-dexamethasone pre and post transplant in relapsed MM patients. Before&#xD;
      enrolment, patients have already received a reinduction therapy, as per local protocols, in&#xD;
      order to achieve an optimal cytoreduction. Since carfilzomib-based regimens (eg.&#xD;
      carfilzomib-lenalidomide-dexamethasone or carfilzomib-dexamethasone) are the current standard&#xD;
      in Italy, for uniformity the use of one of these combinations is recommended. However, any&#xD;
      cytoreductive treatment, excluding anti-CD38 antibodies containing regimens, as per local&#xD;
      practice, is acceptable. During this period, if necessary, it will be possible to mobilize&#xD;
      and collect peripheral blood stem cells. After the pre-enrollment cytoreduction period&#xD;
      (reinduction therapy), patients have achieved at least a PR according to IMWG Response&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After study enrolment, patients will receive 3 courses of isatuximab in combination with&#xD;
      dexamethasone; after cycle 3 patients will receive ASCT, that will be conditioned with&#xD;
      melphalan and will be followed by reinfusion of cryopreserved autologous stem cells. At 2&#xD;
      months after ASCT, patients will start maintenance, consisting in the administration of&#xD;
      isatuximab in combination with dexamethasone for 12 cycles. Starting from cycle 13 onwards,&#xD;
      only isatuximab will be administered until progression or intolerance.&#xD;
