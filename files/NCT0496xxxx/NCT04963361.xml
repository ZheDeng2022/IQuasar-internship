  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total knee arthroplasty is one of the effective methods for the treatment of end-stage&#xD;
      osteoarthritis. Postoperative rehabilitation exercise is an important method for the recovery&#xD;
      of knee joint function. Exercise fear refers to an enlarged psychological phenomenon that&#xD;
      patients are afraid of sports leading to injury, which is not conducive to the functional&#xD;
      exercise of patients and hinders the recovery of knee joint function&#xD;

      Object: the purpose of this study is to investigate the occurrence of fear of movement after&#xD;
      total knee arthroplasty and analyze its influencing factors, so as to provide theoretical&#xD;
      basis for reducing the occurrence of fear of movement after total knee arthroplasty,&#xD;
      promoting the rehabilitation exercise of patients and promoting the recovery of knee joint&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, 121 patients with total knee arthroplasty were investigated by questionnaire,&#xD;
      including general demographic data, sports fear scale, anxiety and depression scale,&#xD;
      self-efficacy scale and so on. Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze the&#xD;
      influencing factors of postoperative fear of exercise.&#xD;
