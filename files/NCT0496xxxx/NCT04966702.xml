  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The BOHEMIA program consists of a combination of studies organized around a central community&#xD;
      prevention mass drug administration protocol and four sub-studies (i.e.; social science,&#xD;
      entomology, health economics, and environmental), each written as an individual protocol. The&#xD;
      protocol is central but used in two separate, individually powered trials in Mozambique and&#xD;
      Tanzania. The trials have been powered on the efficacy outcome and designed to meet the&#xD;
      requirements of WHO´s preferred product characteristics (PPC) for endectocides.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      WHO´s PPC states that the desired efficacy of an endectocide as stand-alone insecticide in&#xD;
      areas of high to moderate transmission is at least 20% reduction in the incidence of clinical&#xD;
      malaria (as primary outcome) and incidence of infection (as secondary outcome) in children&#xD;
      under 5 (the highest incidence age-group in areas with high-transmission), lasting for at&#xD;
      least 1 month following a single regimen. Assessing this effect requires a cluster-randomized&#xD;
      design with meticulous follow-up of a cohort of children for efficacy and the whole exposed&#xD;
      population for safety outcomes, which is the design selected for the BOHEMIA trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two BOHEMIA cluster randomized trials will be carried out in Mozambique (Southern Africa) and&#xD;
      Tanzania (Eastern Africa). These sites encompass different transmission dynamics that&#xD;
      increase the generalizability of results, namely: (a) a gradient of malaria transmission:&#xD;
      moderate in Tanzania and very high in Mozambique, (b) different species composition of vector&#xD;
      population, (c) different rain patterns and environmental conditions, and (d) different&#xD;
      livestock species and human/livestock ratios.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population Co-primary objectives are determined in different populations. Efficacy is&#xD;
      primarily determined in a pediatric active cohort (children under 5 years of age in&#xD;
      Mozambique and 5-15 years in Tanzania), pediatric active cohort, and safety is determined in&#xD;
      anyone who receives the drug. Pregnant women and children under 15 kgs are not eligible for&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Groups Three groups of clusters will be randomized to receive (a) ivermectin in&#xD;
      humans, (b) ivermectin in humans + livestock, or (c) albendazole control, and each study&#xD;
      district will be subject to enhanced passive surveillance for malaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure is proposed as incidence in a six-month period given that&#xD;
      ivermectin is a short-acting intervention with &lt;1% residual drug at 30 days after each dose.&#xD;
      Efficacy assessment will continue 4 months post last dose of ivermectin, and this will&#xD;
      include analysis of the vector population. We have proposed the appropriate duration of&#xD;
      impact evaluation relevant to the biology of the intervention, and geared towards being able&#xD;
      to clean the data, lock the database, and conduct the primary efficacy and safety analysis&#xD;
      efficiently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimated Duration of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the study there will be two different groups of participants enrolled, the ones&#xD;
      receiving the treatment (&gt; 15 kg) and the ones in the active pediatric cohort for the main&#xD;
      outcome of malaria incidence (the ages of highest incidence in each country, under 5 years of&#xD;
      age in Mozambique and 5-15 years in Tanzania). Each group will participate for different&#xD;
      periods of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only the group enrolled in the active pediatric cohort will contribute to the primary&#xD;
      efficacy outcome and this group will participate from date of first dose for six months. The&#xD;
      group receiving treatment (&gt;15 kg) will contribute to the primary safety outcome and several&#xD;
      secondary outcomes (PK, NTDs) and this group will participate for four months. Women of&#xD;
      child-bearing age will be visited one month after the third dose for a final pregnancy test,&#xD;
      any pregnancy occurring during the trial will be followed for 9 months. The cross-sectional&#xD;
      survey will enroll participants of all ages one month after the last MDA round.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WHO guidance states that trial design and duration should reflect the nature of the&#xD;
      intervention and are left at the discretion of researchers. These trials are robustly powered&#xD;
      and are being conducted in moderate to high burden areas, so we believe the risk of failing&#xD;
      to find an effect is low and if so, it would throw the utility of the intervention into&#xD;
      question.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advancing the development of this new tool towards implementation in the field can be&#xD;
      accomplished in a time frame to contribute to the 2030 GTS goals.&#xD;
