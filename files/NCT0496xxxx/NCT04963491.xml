      The subject is planned to carry out the clinical trails of femoral condyle prosthesis, tibial&#xD;
      tray prosthesis and meniscus prosthesis; At the same time, in order to achieve personalized&#xD;
      precision bone resection, the clinical trial verification is carried out on the personalized&#xD;
      cutting guides.&#xD;

      The subject continues the research of Professor Jia-kuo Yu's research group on the&#xD;
      personalized design, processing and manufacturing of personalized total knee arthroplasty&#xD;
      (TKA) prostheses and the verification of animal and human cadavers. It is planned to carry&#xD;
      out the clinical trails of femoral condyle prosthesis, tibial tray prosthesis and meniscus&#xD;
      prosthesis; At the same time, in order to achieve personalized precision bone resection, the&#xD;
      clinical trial verification is carried out on the personalized cutting guides.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the clinical validation study, the research team will summarize the role of personalized&#xD;
      TKA prostheses and personalized TKA cutting guides in the precise and minimally invasive&#xD;
      treatment of knee osteoarthritis.&#xD;
