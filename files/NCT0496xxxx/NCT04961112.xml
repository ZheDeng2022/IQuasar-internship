    <description>Participants will be administered a shock procedure in which they are exposed to safe electrical shock that will be gradually increase from (1) 30 milliseconds to (4) 80 milliseconds to an individual threshold that is uncomfortable but not painful. Participants will be told they may receive additional shocks for poor performance during cognitive assessments.&#xD;
Participants will be administered cranial electrotherapy stimulation with a frequency of 100 Hz and a current of 100 microamps during 30 minutes of cognitive assessments of task switching, inhibition (stroop), working memory (n-back), and processing speed (simple reaction time).</description>
