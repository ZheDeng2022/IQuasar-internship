      This study aims to explore the clinical significance and feasibility of double site biopsy by&#xD;
      analyzing the pathological characteristics and the incidence of main complications of CT&#xD;
      guided puncture biopsy of lung and other parts coexisting lesions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CT guided biopsy is minimally invasive, accurate and low cost. It is often used as an&#xD;
      important diagnostic method when the clinical suspect of malignant disease or the treatment&#xD;
      effect of the disease is not good. In patients with suspected malignant lung disease,&#xD;
      metastasis of other parts of lung, pulmonary door, mediastinum, bone, and distant soft tissue&#xD;
      may be combined at the same time. It is the key link of clinical work to evaluate the nature&#xD;
      of these coexisting lesions accurately and choose appropriate treatment methods. At present,&#xD;
      there is little clinical study on lung centered double site biopsy. This study aims to&#xD;
      explore the clinical significance and feasibility of double site biopsy by analyzing the&#xD;
      pathological characteristics and the incidence of main complications of CT guided puncture&#xD;
      biopsy of lung and other parts coexisting lesions.&#xD;
