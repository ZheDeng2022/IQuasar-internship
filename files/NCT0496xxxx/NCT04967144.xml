  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The discrimination of the right/left side of the body is related to the integrity of the&#xD;
      motor and somatosensory areas at the cortical and subcortical levels. Although some studies&#xD;
      have shown that there may be an effect on the right/left representation at the cortical and&#xD;
      subcortical levels in cases that cause severe neuropathy and neuropathic pain, this effect&#xD;
      has not been proven in milder neuropathies. In this study, the effect on right/left side&#xD;
      discrimination will be investigated even in cases with carpal tunnel syndrome. Additionally,&#xD;
      the investigators aimed to assess the relationship between right/left discrimination and&#xD;
      symptom severity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The left/right discrimination is a motor imagery task that involves viewing images of a body&#xD;
      part and determining whether each image belongs to the left or right side of the body or if&#xD;
      it rotates towards it. Some studies have shown that there may be an effect on the right/left&#xD;
      representation at the cortical and subcortical levels in cases that cause severe neuropathy&#xD;
      and neuropathic pain, this effect has not been proven in milder neuropathies, such as carpal&#xD;
      tunnel syndrome. In this study, the relationship between right/left decision accuracy will be&#xD;
      compared with control subjects. The investigators will assess the relationship between&#xD;
      right/left judgment and symptom severity, two-point discrimination, and handgrip force.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The right/left discrimination accuracy is less than the control subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Right/left discrimination is in relationship with symptom severity, two-point&#xD;
           discrimination, and handgrip force.&#xD;

    <measure>Left/right judgement Task</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Recognize tablet application will be used within the scope of the 'Graded Motor Imagery' set, in the series of publications created by www.noigroup.com right/left side judgement. The application will be performed on a single tablet screen. Within the scope of the application, right and left-hand pictures will be shown to the participants in varying positions and angles at 5-second intervals. The test consists of 50 pictures. At the end of the test, the accuracy rate and the average reaction time will be calculated separately for the right and left sides.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Handgrip strength</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The both handgrip strength of the participants will be evaluated with a JAMAR hand dynamometer.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Two-point discrimination test</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The participants will use a 2-point disc-criminator with 2-point separation and the narrowest interval reported by the participant as two separate points with repetitive measurements from the distal volar region of both index fingers will be recorded.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analogue Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The patient will be asked to mark his/her severity of pain on a 10-cm horizontal line with number 0 one end representing 'no' and number 10 on the other end indicating 'very severe pain'.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PainDETECT questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The presence of neuropathic pain will be evaluated with the painDETECT questionnaire. The maximum score is 35 and a high score indicates the severity of neuropathic pain. When the painDETECT questionnaire score is more than 13, it is indicated the presence of a neuropathic pain component.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire comprises two parts, the Symptom Severity (SSS) and the Functional Status Scale (FSS). In the SSS, there are 11 questions; responses may be scored one (mildest) point to five (most severe) points. In the FSS, there are eight questions assessing the difficulty in performing selected activities.</description>
