  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of Teleorientation in oral hygiene&#xD;
      during Pandemic by COVID-19 in children aged 6 to 10 years, attended at the Pediatric Clinic&#xD;
      of Forp. For this, a randomized clinical study will be carried out with the factor to be&#xD;
      analyzed the comparison between synchronous and asynchronous teleorientation, the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the transfer of knowledge in oral hygiene through video modeling and remote&#xD;
      guidance. The response variables will be the assimilation of oral hygiene guidance through&#xD;
      video modeling and synchronous guidance, the hypothesis is that educational content will have&#xD;
      beneficial effects on children's oral health.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized clinical trial, whose sample is composed of thirty children aged 6 to 10&#xD;
      years, attended between the year 2019 and the beginning of 2020. The sample will be randomly&#xD;
      randomized into 3 groups who received guidance on toothbrushing. group 1 will be done&#xD;
      Teleorientation of tooth brushing through video call by the Whatsapp application, in group 2&#xD;
      will be done Teleorientation of toothbrushing through a platform designed exclusively for&#xD;
      teleconsultations and group 3 will receive the same in-person brushing orientation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of the clinical trial is to develop and analyze a program of Teleorientation&#xD;
      of Toothbrushing in children of the Pediatric Dentistry clinic of FORP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Specific Objectives are assess whether oral hygiene is taking place properly during the&#xD;
      COVID-19 Pandemic, assess, through a questionnaire, the level of understanding of parents and&#xD;
      caregivers regarding the information received. This project will be designed as a randomized&#xD;
      study with a two-month follow-up. The study factor will be to compare synchronous with&#xD;
      asynchronous teleorientation, the effectiveness of knowledge transfer in oral hygiene through&#xD;
      video modeling and remote orientation. The response variables will be the assimilation of&#xD;
      guidance in oral hygiene by video modeling and by synchronous guidance, the hypothesis is&#xD;
      that educational content will have beneficial effects on the oral health of children. The&#xD;
      procedures will be performed at the Pediatric Dentistry Clinic of the Faculty of Dentistry of&#xD;
      Ribeirão Preto - University of São Paulo - FORP/USP. The CONSORT guide (Schulz et al., 2010)&#xD;
      for randomized controlled trials will be followed for the design of the present study.&#xD;
