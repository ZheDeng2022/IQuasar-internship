      Pretest/post-test study design, study will try to determine if a 6-week neuromuscular&#xD;
      training program designed to decrease the incidence of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)&#xD;
      injuries would improve single-limb stability in young female athletes. Healthy female high&#xD;
      school athletes will participate in this study. Single-limb postural stability for both lower&#xD;
      extremities will be assessed with Stork balance test, Star Excursion Balance Test for Dynamic&#xD;
      Balance and Single leg stance test for static balance. Participants will be included through&#xD;
      convenient sampling. Informed consent will be taken from all the participants.&#xD;

      In this Controlled single-group pretest/post-test study design, study will try to determine&#xD;
      if a 6-week neuromuscular training program designed to decrease the incidence of anterior&#xD;
      cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries would improve single-limb stability in young female&#xD;
      athletes. Current study hypothesized that neuromuscular training would result in an&#xD;
      improvement of postural stability, with the greatest improvement taking place in the&#xD;
      medial-lateral direction. Healthy female high school athletes will participate in this study.&#xD;
      Single-limb postural stability for both lower extremities will be assessed with Stork balance&#xD;
      test, Star Excursion Balance Test for Dynamic Balance and Single leg stance test for static&#xD;
      balance. Participants will be included through convenient sampling. Informed consent will be&#xD;
      taken from all the participants. Those individuals who will match the inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be a part of the study. The neuromuscular training program will consist of&#xD;
      three 90-minute training sessions per week for 6 weeks. Following the completion of the&#xD;
      training program, each subject will be re-evaluated to determine change in total,&#xD;
      anterior-posterior, and medial-lateral single-limb stability.&#xD;

    <measure>i. Star Excursion Balance Test for Dynamic Balance</measure>
    <time_frame>6th Week</time_frame>
    <description>dynamic test that requires strength, flexibility, and proprioception. It is a measure of dynamic balance that provides a significant challenge to athletes and physically active individuals. The test can be used to assess physical performance</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>ii. Single Limb Stance Test (Static Posture and Balance)</measure>
    <time_frame>6th Week</time_frame>
    <description>The Single leg Stance (SLS) Test is used to assess static postural and balance control.Performed with eyes open and hands on the hips.Client must stand unassisted on one leg</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>iii. Stork balance test</measure>
    <time_frame>6th Week</time_frame>
    <description>The standing stork test monitors the progress of the athletes' abilities to maintain balance in a static position. This test monitors the balance of athletes because the more balance you have as an athlete, the better you may perform on the field and the fewer injuries you are likely to sustain.</description>

    <description>The neuromuscular training program will consist of three 90-minute training sessions per week for 6 weeks. The 3 components of the dynamic neuromuscular training protocol utilized in this study include: (1) balance training and hip/pelvis/trunk strengthening, (2) plyometrics and dynamic movement training, and (3) resistance training. Following the completion of the training program, each subject will be re-evaluated to determine change in total, anterior-posterior, and medial-lateral single-limb stability. Two-way analysis of variance models will be used to determine differences between pre-training and post-training and between limbs.</description>
