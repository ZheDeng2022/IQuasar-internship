    <textblock>
      Acute appendicitis (AA), is a common intra-abdominal surgical pathology with the overall&#xD;
      incidence of approximately 7% and mortality of 0.2-0.8%. Treatment of choice is the surgical&#xD;
      removal of the inflamed appendix by using open or laparoscopic appendectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following laparoscopic appendectomy (LA) proved to be a feasible and at least as safe as the&#xD;
      corresponding open procedure, it has rapidly gained worldwide acceptance. The traditional&#xD;
      approach to LA uses three ports. Over the past decade, successful attempts to perform the&#xD;
      procedure with fewer ports have been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The authors' primary objectives were to 1) identify a simple, safe and feasible way to&#xD;
      perform laparoscopic appendectomy in patients with uncomplicated acute appendicitis. 2)&#xD;
      determine the health related quality of life of the patients and calculate the cost per&#xD;
      quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained after the procedures (LAA and TLA). 3) Purpose a&#xD;
      surgical algorithm when approaching to acute appendicitis with the consideration of quality&#xD;

      Acute appendicitis (AA), is a common intra-abdominal surgical pathology with the overall&#xD;
      incidence of approximately 7% and mortality of 0.2-0.8%. Treatment of choice is the surgical&#xD;
      removal of the inflamed appendix by using open or laparoscopic appendectomy. Until the first&#xD;
      laparoscopic removal of an inflamed appendix by Kurt Semm in 1980, the gold standard for&#xD;
      surgical treatment of acute appendicitis remained open appendectomy as first described by&#xD;
      McBurney in 1891.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning, LA remained questionable whether the benefits of the procedure outweigh&#xD;
      over its disadvantages. However, since laparoscopic technology advances and surgeons'&#xD;
      expertise increases, many surgeons have successfully performed a multitude of laparoscopic&#xD;
      procedures for AA, with a continued increasing trend in its use. Eventually, after LA proved&#xD;
      to be a feasible and at least as safe as the corresponding open procedure, it has rapidly&#xD;
      gained worldwide acceptance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are more techniques for LA in the literature but only a few of them have gained to&#xD;
      access and described in modern textbooks. The traditional approach to LA uses three ports.&#xD;
      Over the past decade, successful attempts to perform the procedure with fewer ports have been&#xD;
      reported which include two-port techniques, single-port techniques, and hybrid approaches.&#xD;
      The two-port appendectomy technique consist of one port providing access for a rigid&#xD;
      telescope with a working channel, and second port for a grasping forceps that is used to&#xD;
      retract the appendix. In the single-port assisted technique, after a stitch is placed between&#xD;
      the appendix and the anterior abdominal wall to pull the appendix and create a tension to&#xD;
      facilitate dissection, and then appendectomy is performed intracorporeally. The hybrid&#xD;
      technique formed from the combination of both open and laparoscopic approaches. Namely the&#xD;
      appendix is pulled out through the only or one of the port, and a traditional open&#xD;
      appendectomy is then performed extracorporeally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The authors' primary objectives were to 1) identify a simple, safe and feasible way to&#xD;
      perform laparoscopic appendectomy in patients with uncomplicated acute appendicitis. 2)&#xD;
      determine the health related quality of life of the patients using Euro Qol (EQ) - 5&#xD;
      Dimensions (5D) - 3 Levels (3L) (EQ-5D-3L) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and calculate the&#xD;
      cost per quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained after the procedures (LAA and TLA). 3)&#xD;
      Purpose a surgical algorithm when approaching to acute appendicitis with the consideration of&#xD;
      quality of health and cost. For these purposes, a case-control study was designed in January&#xD;
      2015 to investigate these issues.&#xD;
