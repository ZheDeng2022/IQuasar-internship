  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As the transparency committee of the Haute Autorité de Santé pointed out due to lack of data&#xD;
      regarding comparative trial of Yondelis versus best supportive care, activity of Yondelis in&#xD;
      soft tissue sarcoma remain to be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For an antineoplastic drug toxicity is moderate. As previous studies shown, overall survival&#xD;
      data for patients with advanced or metastatic STS are of poor prognosis despite improvement&#xD;
      of results this last years. For example, median overall survival increased from 12,3 months&#xD;
      (1987-1991) to 11,4 months (1992-1996) and then 18 months (2002-2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the latest results with and without Trabectedin, the investigators may consider&#xD;
      that comparing Trabectedin with best supportive care is ethically acceptable as long as&#xD;
      patients consent to enter the trial.&#xD;

    <description>At Day 1 (D1), premedication with dexamethasone (20 mg) and a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist anti-emetic agent will be intravenously administered 30 minutes prior to trabectedin administration. Trabectedin will be administered through a central venous catheter at a starting dose of 1.5 mg/m² over 24 hours, diluted in at least 500 mL of normal saline solution or of glucose 5% injectable solution.&#xD;
Each treatment cycle will last 21 days. Treatment duration: the treatment might be pursued until disease progression according to RECIST 1.1, or patient refusal, or toxicities.&#xD;
In case of disease progression, the further treatments will be based on investigator's judgement.</description>

    <description>Treatment:&#xD;
Patients will receive the best supportive care (BSC) in order to alleviate their symptoms and improve their Quality of Life (QoL).&#xD;
Antineoplastic agents (including surgery, radiotherapy, thermotherapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, hormonal treatment or antibodies-based treatments) are prohibited.&#xD;
Treatment duration: the treatment might be pursued until disease progression according to RECIST 1.1, or patient refusal.&#xD;
In case of disease progression, a treatment with trabectedin will be proposed (cross-over). In case of patient refusal, the further treatments will be based on investigator's judgement.</description>
