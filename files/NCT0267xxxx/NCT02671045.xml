    <textblock>
      Overall survival rates for patients with metastatic NSCLC are poor utilizing conventional&#xD;
      cytotoxic chemotherapy approaches. However, a subset of patients harbor genomic driver&#xD;
      mutations, which when targeted with specific therapies, experience improved outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, identification of these mutations, although recommended in national&#xD;
      guidelines, has been limited for a variety of factors including small biopsy samples. The&#xD;
      broad application of a sensitive genomic profiling test, which simultaneously examines for&#xD;
      multiple genomic alterations on limited biopsy material, could increase the identification of&#xD;
      patients with actionable mutations and thereby improve survival in NSCLC. The FoundationOne&#xD;
      test meets these requirements. A recent study using the FoundationOne assay identified a&#xD;
      significant number of actionable mutations among NSCLC patients who were previously thought&#xD;
      to be negative for mutations when tested using other approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a non-randomized observational comparative study with various cohorts based on&#xD;
      physician diagnostic patterns of care and biologic genomic profile status. Survival and cost&#xD;
      information will be compared based on different use of genomic profiling.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The understanding of NSCLC is undergoing a rapid evolution from one disease treated with&#xD;
      empirically chosen, costly cytotoxic chemotherapies, laden with adverse effects and benefits&#xD;
      lasting only weeks or a few months, to a rapidly growing set of genomically defined diseases&#xD;
      that can be matched to targeted therapies with markedly improved outcomes, including response&#xD;
      rates of 70-80% and survivals often measured in years rather than months. The need for&#xD;
      comprehensive genomic profiling tests able to accommodate the expanding list of genomic&#xD;
      markers without necessitating new biopsies or rising cost is not just a convenience, but a&#xD;
      medical necessity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In October 2014, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) specifically recommended&#xD;
      that patients with metastatic NSCLC undergo &quot;broad molecular profiling&quot; with the goal of&#xD;
      identifying rare driver mutations for which effective drugs may already be available, or to&#xD;
      appropriately counsel patients regarding the availability of clinical trials, including not&#xD;
      only EGFR and ALK, but also BRAF, ERBB2 (HER2), MET, RET and ROS1. For example, while ERBB2&#xD;
      alterations are certainly more common in breast cancer, these same alterations have also been&#xD;
      found in NSCLC and thus would predict response to targeted therapy with anti-HER2 agents.&#xD;
      Specifically, each of these additional targetable alterations indicate a greatly increased&#xD;
      likelihood of response to a respective targeted treatment, even though some of the treatments&#xD;
      would be considered 'off-label' for lung cancer (e.g. trastuzumab or afatinib targeting&#xD;
      patients with ERBB2 alterations; crizotinib for MET amplification and ROS1 rearrangements),&#xD;
      or on-label drugs approved for lung cancer (e.g. crizotinib targeting patients with ALK&#xD;
      rearrangements).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Problems in Genomic Testing: The substantial increase in the number of recommended targetable&#xD;
      alterations in NSCLC presents multiple clinical and logistic challenges to the current model&#xD;
      of gene-by-gene testing. These include non-validated testing, missed alterations that could&#xD;
      have been matched to targeted therapy, insufficient tissue due to sequential or parallel&#xD;
      testing, unacceptably long turnaround times, and physician frustration and confusion related&#xD;
      to delays in obtaining all needed results and complex interpretation of multiple reports.&#xD;
      Based on recent publications, it is reasonable to anticipate the list of targetable&#xD;
      alterations that should be evaluated as 'standard of care' will only continue to expand. This&#xD;
      reality makes the current model of individual tests in a gene-by-gene model unsustainable.&#xD;
      For example traditional testing would require multiple modalities, including polymerase chain&#xD;
      reaction (PCR)-based tests, capillary sequencing, fluorescence in situ hybridization&#xD;
      (FISH)-based testing, and mass spectrometry-based sizing assays. Insufficient tissue to&#xD;
      supply all of these tests is a particular problem. Traditional pathologic evaluation,&#xD;
      including testing for the seven targetable alterations in the NCCN guidelines, may require&#xD;
      more than 26 slides -- a tissue requirement that is usually beyond the amount obtained from&#xD;
      minimally invasive biopsies. Competing demands for scarce tissue may place clinicians in an&#xD;
      uncomfortable position of having to guess which tests to run when slides are running out, or&#xD;
      alternatively, to consider conducting additional biopsy procedures. These challenges will&#xD;
      only grow in complexity as biopsies become less invasive, the number of molecular markers and&#xD;
      targeted therapeutic options increase, and evidence for newer markers becomes stronger.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FoundationOne is a comprehensive genomic profile that applies next generation sequencing in a&#xD;
      unique manner to identify all 4 types of genomic alterations across all genes known to be&#xD;
      unambiguous drivers of solid tumors with high accuracy. The test simultaneously sequences the&#xD;
      coding region of 315 cancer-related genes plus introns from 28 genes often rearranged or&#xD;
      altered in cancer to a typical median depth of coverage of greater than 500X. Each covered&#xD;
      read represents a unique DNA fragment to enable the highly sensitive and specific detection&#xD;
      of genomic alterations that occur at low frequencies due to tumor heterogeneity, low tumor&#xD;
      purity and small tissue samples. FoundationOne detects all classes of genomic alterations,&#xD;
      including base substitutions, insertions and deletions (indels), copy number alterations&#xD;
      (CNAs) and rearrangements using a small, routine FFPE sample (including core or fine needle&#xD;
      biopsies).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Foundation Medicine recently collaborated with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC)&#xD;
      to evaluate the clinical utility of this approach. After appropriate institutional approvals,&#xD;
      a group of patients with advanced NSCLC who had completed in-house clinical testing in the&#xD;
      CLIA-accredited MSKCC lab and who tested negative for all using conventional diagnostics, and&#xD;
      who were alive and receiving systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy were identified. Before they&#xD;
      were tested using FoundationOne, 24 of the first 34 such patients had required additional&#xD;
      biopsies to complete the initial requisite testing. In 9 of the 34 clinical cases,&#xD;
      FoundationOne could not be performed due to lack of available tissue after the initial rounds&#xD;
      of MSKCC testing. FoundationOne was successfully performed in 25 patients uncovering one or&#xD;
      more genomic alterations linked to a targeted agent based on NCCN guidelines in 36% (9/25&#xD;
      cases) and a targeted agent available on an open clinical trial at MSKCC in 32% (8/25) of&#xD;
      patients. This approach simultaneously analyzes the multiple genes and classes of genomic&#xD;
      alteration required for clinical care and are readily adapted to efficiently incorporate a&#xD;
      rapidly expanding landscape of targetable alterations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: This is a non-randomized observational comparative study with various cohorts&#xD;
      based on physician diagnostic patterns of care and biologic genomic profile status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of Subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. All eligible patients (consecutive) with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer treated at&#xD;
           a COTA center will be enrolled and followed on this observational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. All physicians at COTA centers will be reminded that genomic profiling of non-small cell&#xD;
           lung cancer is technically possible and in some circumstances recommended per national&#xD;
           guidelines. For those patients who have Horizon Blue Cross insurance the physician will&#xD;
           also be informed that the FoundationOne genomic profile will be a financially covered&#xD;
           test. It however will be the physician's independent choice whether to order diagnostic&#xD;
           testing and/or where this testing will be performed, without influence of the protocol&#xD;
           study team.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. If performed, the results of genomic profiling of the lung cancer specimen will be&#xD;
           recorded in the COTA database, regardless of type or site of testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Treatment of the patient will be at the sole discretion of the physician. Time to&#xD;
           initiation of therapy from the first oncology visit, and from the time of biopsy will be&#xD;
           recorded. Time from biopsy to receipt of genomic profiling will also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. If a mutation in EGFR or an ALK rearrangement is identified the physician will be&#xD;
           encouraged to treat the patient with the approved targeted agent per current national&#xD;
           guidelines. If a ROS fusion is identified the physician will also be encouraged to&#xD;
           consider off label use of an approved targeted therapy (ie, crizotinib).&#xD;
&#xD;
      6 If an &quot;actionable&quot; mutation is identified that does not have an approved targeted therapy&#xD;
      the physician will be notified of any available research trials that might be considered.&#xD;
      However, the decision to utilize a specific agent will be at the sole discretion of the&#xD;
      treating physician. To expand the opportunities to offer targeted therapies, participating&#xD;
      COTA centers will be encouraged to open national trials in lung cancer. The COTA protocol&#xD;
      team will meet with individual centers to assist in research start-up if desired. Eligibility&#xD;
      and participation in targeted therapy trials will be per the individual protocols. Consent&#xD;
      for study participation will be separate from this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7 At the sole discretion of the treating physician the patient may be treated with&#xD;
      chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery or other means. Consent for these treatments will be&#xD;
      obtained by the treatment team, separate from this observational study, in accordance with&#xD;
      policies and procedures of the treating center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8 Patients will be allocated into one of seven cohorts based on the physicians choice of&#xD;
      genomic profiling use 9 All patients will be tracked using the COTA database using the&#xD;
      standard collection fields for lung cancer, including but not limited to demographics,&#xD;
      smoking history, treatments and toxicities, and survival outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10 All patients will complete ECOG performance scores at a minimum of monthly per usual&#xD;
      protocols at each center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11 All patients will complete the patient reported Living with Cancer (LWC) instrument at the&#xD;
      time of diagnosis and monthly thereafter .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Response Assessments and Planned Analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The primary endpoint is related to overall survival. All subjects will be followed for&#xD;
           overall survival. Date of death will be recorded in the COTA database.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The primary endpoints will be the overall survival duration (median) and the 2 year&#xD;
           survival rates for patients within the following cohorts: Cohorts A+B+C versus Cohorts&#xD;
           D+E+F+G (patients undergoing FoundationOne assay testing vs not undergoing testing) The&#xD;
           analysis will be performed for the entire study population and separately for the&#xD;
           non-squamous cell lung cancer histologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The key secondary endpoints will be the overall survival duration (median) and the 2&#xD;
           year survival rates for patients within the following cohorts (additional comparisons&#xD;
           may be performed including repeat analysis in the non-squamous histologies): Cohorts A&#xD;
           vs B vs C vs D vs E vs F vs G Cohorts A+D versus Cohorts B+C+E+F+G (patients with&#xD;
           actionable mutations receiving targeted therapies vs those not) Cohorts A+B+D+E versus&#xD;
           Cohorts C+F+G (patients with actionable mutations regardless of treatment vs those&#xD;
           without targets) Cohorts A+B+C+D+E+F versus Cohort G (patients undergoing testing vs not&#xD;
           undergoing testing) Cohort A versus Cohorts B+C+D+E+F+G (patients receiving targeted&#xD;
           therapy based on FoundationOne assay testing vs not)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Frequency of genomic mutations as documented by FoundationOne assay or any other&#xD;
           molecular profiling will be recorded&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. A secondary endpoint will be to determine whether the identification of actionable&#xD;
           genomic mutations is increased with the FoundationOne assay versus other methodologies.&#xD;
           The retrospective RCCA rate of mutational identification was 22% using non-Foundation&#xD;
           Medicine testing. In addition to this (and other historical comparisons) a comparison of&#xD;
           the identified mutation rate in Cohorts A+B+C vs Cohorts D+E+F will be performed. The&#xD;
           analysis will be performed in the entire cohort and the non-squamous histologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Total cost of care will be obtained via COTA sources as available.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. A secondary endpoint will be to determine whether the use of the FoundationOne test&#xD;
           impacts total costs. Several comparisons will be performed including a comparison of&#xD;
           Cohorts A+B+C vs D+E+F+G (FM vs not), a comparison of A+B+C vs D+E+F (FM vs other&#xD;
           genomic testing), a comparison of A+D vs B+C+E+F+G (targeted therapy used vs not)&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Dosing of medications and toxicities will be recorded as per COTA standards&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Quality of Life Analyses will be performed&#xD;
