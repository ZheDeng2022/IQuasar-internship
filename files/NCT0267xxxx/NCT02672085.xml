      Background and Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tedious PRP infiltrations are emerging treatments for tendinopathies and tendon tears. It has&#xD;
      been showed effective in different parts of the body, but current evidences for rotator cuff&#xD;
      PRP infiltration remains poor. Some studies that tested infiltrations on transfixing lesions&#xD;
      showed no statistically significant effect of PRP on tendon healing. The investigators&#xD;
      believe that this might be explained by a &quot;flushing effect&quot; of PRP into subacromial space or&#xD;
      glenohumeral joint. Therefore, it was decided to focus this study on interstitial lesions, in&#xD;
      which PRP is entrapped into the lesion for a long time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether intra-tear PRP infiltrations promotes tear&#xD;
      repair better than needling procedures of torn tendon in participants with supraspinatus&#xD;
      interstitial tears.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As secondary objective, we will study symptoms alleviation in same way. Primary outcome:&#xD;
      Primary outcome: Supraspinatus tear size change from baseline will be compared between cases&#xD;
      receiving two PRP injections and controls receiving torn tendon needling, 6 months after&#xD;
      second injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes: Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation score, Constant score, ASES score,&#xD;
      Shoulder pain disability index, and Visual analogue scale changes from baseline will be&#xD;
      compared between cases receiving two PRP injections and controls receiving torn tendon&#xD;
      needling, 0,1,3, and 6 months after second injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This case-control study is randomized 1:1 between PRP (intervention group) and&#xD;
      needling (Control group). It is a superiority trial that will include 84 patients suffering&#xD;
      from interstitial supraspinatus tears. As adjuvant therapy, patients from each arm will&#xD;
      beneficiate from standard physical therapy program. PRP and needling will be repeated 2&#xD;
      times, at one month interval. First injection will occur up to two months after recruitment.&#xD;
      Clinical follow-up will occur from second injection to one year after second injection, with&#xD;
      clinical parameters evaluation at 0,1,3, and 6 months after second injection, and control MRI&#xD;
      6 months after second injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Product / Intervention: Supraspinatus tendon needling with intralesional PRP injection.&#xD;
      PRP will be extracted with Regenlab® extraction kit. No other medications used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Intervention (if applicable): Supraspinatus tendon needling with intralesional saline&#xD;
      water injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Participants with Rationale: 84 patients will be needed (37 in each group). A 10%&#xD;
      of dropout has been taken in consideration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration: 24 months from recruitment of the first patient to the last follow-up visit.&#xD;
      Scientific report will be written within the two months following recruitment of the last&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;

      DETAILLED PLANNED STATISTICAL METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null hypothesis: In patients with interstitial rotator cuff tear, there is no difference in&#xD;
      term of tendon tear size percentage between baseline and 6 months after intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternative hypothesis: In patients with interstitial rotator cuff tear, there is a&#xD;
      difference in term of tendon of tendon tear size percentage between baseline and 6 months&#xD;
      after intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of Sample Size&#xD;
&#xD;
      No previous data allows predicting the standard deviation of supraspinatus tear volume. In&#xD;
      order to evaluate the standard deviation of tear size progression in percentage from&#xD;
      baseline, investigators aimed to identify patients followed conservatively for interstitial&#xD;
      supraspinatus tears, and in which two MRI has been performed at 3 to 9 months of interval. In&#xD;
      this way, 25 patients were identified, and their tear sizes were measured. From this sample,&#xD;
      an hypothetical standard deviation of 76% of the initial teas size was estimated. The&#xD;
      investigators considered that potential PRP effect on tear size is clinically relevant if it&#xD;
      allows a healing of 50% of the lesion size. Taking on consideration those points, 76 patients&#xD;
      should be included to be able to reject the null hypothesis that the population means of the&#xD;
      experimental and control groups are equal with probability (power) of 80%. The Type I error&#xD;
      probability associated with this test of this null hypothesis is 0.05. Taking in&#xD;
      consideration 10% of potential dropouts, it was planned to include 84 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following planned Analyses will be performed by Dr Adrien Schwitzguébel at the end of the&#xD;
      study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline clinical parameters They will be compared between the two groups with adapted&#xD;
           statistic tests (Chi-squared, Wilcoxon, or T test).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary outcome Supraspinatus tear size percentage difference between baseline and 6&#xD;
           months post intervention will be compared between the two groups with Student test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary outcome Clinical scores (Constant, ASES, SPADI, SANE, and VAS) differences&#xD;
           between baseline and different time points will be compared between the two groups with&#xD;
           Student test (or Wilcoxon test in case of non-parametric distribution). Even if those&#xD;
           multiple analysis aims to evaluate clinical evolution of the two groups, no corrections&#xD;
           will be applied on p values, but rather the aspect of a global tendency will be&#xD;
           integrated in the discussion. In order to see whether small tears are more prone to&#xD;
           beneficiate from treatment, correlation coefficient will be calculated between tear size&#xD;
           percentage difference and initial tear size.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Handling of missing data and drop-outs In case of missing clinical parameters on&#xD;
           interest for primary outcome calculation, patients will be excluded of the study. In&#xD;
           case of missing clinical parameters on interest for secondary outcome calculation or&#xD;
           baseline clinical parameters, analysis will be performed by removing patients with the&#xD;
           missing value from corresponding analysis only.&#xD;
