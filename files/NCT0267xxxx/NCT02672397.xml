  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if an educational intervention provided to pregnant women&#xD;
      in early labor has an effect on their decision to use epidural anesthesia for relief of labor&#xD;
      pain. The study will also investigate differences between Hispanic and non-Hispanic white&#xD;
      women in their attitudes and beliefs regarding epidurals in labor. Previous studies have&#xD;
      shown that Hispanic women receive epidural anesthesia in labor much less frequently than&#xD;
      their non-Hispanic white counterparts. The investigators hypothesize that the rate of&#xD;
      epidural use will be higher in subjects who receive the educational intervention than in&#xD;
      those who do not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who have been admitted to the OHSU labor and delivery unit will be screened for study&#xD;
      eligibility. In order to minimize the influence of socioeconomic factors, only women&#xD;
      receiving Medicaid will be enrolled. Other inclusion criteria include age of at least 18&#xD;
      years, having a fetus of at least 24 weeks gestational age, and being categorized as American&#xD;
      Society of Anesthesiologist category 1 to 3. Exclusion criteria include any condition that&#xD;
      either excludes or mandates neuraxial anesthesia. Midwife patients are also excluded from&#xD;
      this study. Those who meet study criteria will be approached by a member of the study team&#xD;
      and informed consent will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive an educational intervention about epidurals or&#xD;
      no educational intervention. Hispanic and non-Hispanic subjects will be randomized&#xD;
      separately, yielding four study groups (Hispanic - intervention; Hispanic - control;&#xD;
      non-Hispanic - intervention, non-Hispanic - control). The investigators expect to enroll&#xD;
      approximately 176 women, 44 in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will complete a survey in early labor and again 1 to 2 days postpartum that asks&#xD;
      about common beliefs and misconceptions regarding epidurals. Subjects in the intervention&#xD;
      group will receive an educational pamphlet and watch a video in their native language&#xD;
      (spanish or english) about epidurals, and have an opportunity to ask questions. Study staff&#xD;
      will collect limited information about the subject's labor and delivery from the electronic&#xD;
      medical record.&#xD;

      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to be a prospective, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial at&#xD;
      Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU) in Portland, Oregon. The investigators will&#xD;
      enroll Hispanic and non-Hispanic parturients in equal numbers on the labor and delivery floor&#xD;
      to receive both an educational pamphlet and video in their primary language or no educational&#xD;
      intervention. All parturients will receive standard of practice consent for general/regional&#xD;
      anesthesia by an anesthesiology resident or attending.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 176 participants will be enrolled in the study. Within the 176 participants there&#xD;
      will be four groups of patients: (1) Hispanic subjects that receive additional epidural&#xD;
      education [44 patients], (2) Hispanic subjects that receive standard of care [44 patients],&#xD;
      (3) non-Hispanic subjects that receive additional epidural education [44 patients], and (4)&#xD;
      non-Hispanic subjects that receive standard of care [44 patients].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the past year 421 Hispanic and 215 non-Hispanic patients with Medicaid insurance&#xD;
      delivered at OHSU. The rate-limiting step in the study will be enrolling enough non-Hispanic&#xD;
      subjects on Medicaid and so study timeline calculations are based upon expected enrollment of&#xD;
      those subjects. Assuming 15% of patients approached decline study participation and the&#xD;
      research team misses another 35% of patients the investigators believe they can enroll the&#xD;
      necessary 88 subjects in 300 days or approximately 10 months (during which time 177&#xD;
      non-Hispanic Medicaid deliveries would occur).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients appropriate for inclusion in the study will be identified at OHSU after they have&#xD;
      been admitted to the labor and delivery unit. A cursory review of the labor and delivery unit&#xD;
      census on EPIC will be used to identify qualifying patients (ASA I-III category patients of&#xD;
      18 years of age on Medicaid with that are either in labor or committed to labor via&#xD;
      induction). All patients who pass this initial screen with have a more thorough review of&#xD;
      their record with particular attention paid to ethnicity and medical conditions that would&#xD;
      affect the decision to offer neuraxial analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent, Initial Encounter survey, and Epidural Pre-Test Questionnaire will be&#xD;
      administered in the OHSU Labor and Delivery Unit. The Epidural Post-Test Questionnaire will&#xD;
      be administered in the patient's recovery room 1-2 days after giving birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients that appear to meet inclusion criteria will be identified at OHSU after they have&#xD;
      been admitted to the labor and delivery unit. A cursory review of EPIC on the work computers&#xD;
      of the researchers or labor and delivery unit computers will be used to identify patients&#xD;
      that warrant a deeper chart review (ASA I-III category patients of at least 18 years on&#xD;
      Medicaid that are either in labor or committed to labor via induction). All patients that&#xD;
      pass this initial screen will have a more thorough review of their medical record with&#xD;
      particular attention paid to ethnicity, whether they are an MD or midwife patient, and&#xD;
      medical conditions that may affect the decision to offer neuraxial anesthesia. All patients&#xD;
      that pass this EPIC screen will be approached by the research team and allowed to participate&#xD;
      in the study. There will be no fliers, advertisements, videos, or webpages set up to recruit&#xD;
      patients. There will be no monetary awards or free services offered to study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent Process&#xD;
&#xD;
      A member of the research team will perform subject recruitment and obtain written informed&#xD;
      consent in the OHSU Labor and Delivery Unit in order to minimize the possibility of coercion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be provided the Consent and Authorization form in their preferred language&#xD;
      (English or Spanish) and will have an opportunity to ask questions of the research team&#xD;
      member after the study protocol is explained. An interpreter/translator will be available via&#xD;
      telephone for Spanish speaking women during this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject allocation will occur in the labor room after informed consent has occurred.&#xD;
      Allocation will occur when the research assistant opens one of a series of sequentially&#xD;
      numbered opaque envelopes containing group assignment (by a computer generated random number&#xD;
      sequence [Excel, Redmond WA]. A researcher not involved in either subject enrollment or&#xD;
      subject assignment will generate the random number sequence. The anesthesia and obstetric&#xD;
      team caring for the subject will remain blinded on whether the subject received additional&#xD;
      educational materials; however, due to the type of study it is impossible to blind the&#xD;
      subject. Subjects will be allocated to either an epidural-focused educational intervention or&#xD;
      no intervention by ethnicity stratified block randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects that agree to participate in the study will have demographic data collected from&#xD;
      EPIC (age, race, gravida, parity, gestational age, BMI, birth history) and will be given a&#xD;
      subject questionnaire in their primary language that will ask about potential confounders&#xD;
      that may affect epidural usage (highest education achieved, length of time the subject's&#xD;
      family has lived in the U.S., past personal and family experience with epidurals, needle&#xD;
      phobia, etc.). At the conclusion of the study some additional information will be taken from&#xD;
      EPIC (length of labor, type of delivery, APGAR scores, and whether an epidural was used for&#xD;
      labor analgesia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects enrolled in the study will be given a survey in their primary language seeking&#xD;
      to identify potential barriers to neuraxial anesthesia utilization. Included in this survey&#xD;
      will be a yes/no checklist for the subject to complete that includes some previously&#xD;
      published reasons that patients commonly give for not wanting neuraxial anesthesia. This&#xD;
      survey will be given again in the postpartum period to all women enrolled in the study. The&#xD;
      postpartum survey will serve as a post-test to evaluate the effectiveness of the educational&#xD;
      intervention in those women that received additional education materials. The post-test will&#xD;
      also be given to women in the control group to determine if the process of delivering a baby&#xD;
      either with or without an epidural affects subject views on neuraxial anesthesia. The&#xD;
      completion of the posttest will mark the end of each parturient's time of participation in&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All women allocated to receive additional educational materials will be given a language&#xD;
      appropriate pamphlet and video on neuraxial anesthesia. The video and pamphlet will be in the&#xD;
      subject's primary language. After the subject watches the educational video they will be&#xD;
      given an opportunity to go through the pamphlet with the research assistant and ask any&#xD;
      questions they may have. For Spanish-speaking subjects this will occur through a telephone&#xD;
      interpreter. The obstetric anesthesia providers and obstetricians caring for the subject will&#xD;
      be absent for the educational video and post-video conversation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who elect to receive neuraxial anesthesia will be administered the procedure by an&#xD;
      anesthesiology resident with supervision by an attending anesthesiologist. A lumbar epidural&#xD;
      catheter will be placed and after initial bolus (spinal or epidural) all subjects will be&#xD;
      started on a patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) protocol with a solution of 0.055%&#xD;
      bupivacaine with 1 mcg/mL sufentanil. The initial PCEA settings for all subjects will be the&#xD;
      following: maintenance infusion rate of 10 ml/hr, bolus of 5 ml, lockout of 15 minutes, with&#xD;
      a maximum of 4 boluses an hour. The maintenance infusion rate, bolus volume, and lockout&#xD;
      interval will be allowed to be adjusted as deemed necessary by the obstetric anesthesiology&#xD;
      team. Subjects with pain refractory to the initial PCEA settings will be allowed to get&#xD;
      additional epidural boluses of medication by the anesthesiology resident or attending. The&#xD;
      PCEA will be continued until delivery or slightly thereafter depending upon subject need. The&#xD;
      PCEA will be allowed to be turned off or down to help with stage two pushing or to avoid&#xD;
      maternal hypotension. Other more rare complications involving neuraxial anesthesia will be&#xD;
      dealt with according to standard of care practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculations are based upon the abstract presented at the Society for&#xD;
      Maternal-Fetal Medicine. In that study, only 40% of women assigned to additional prenatal&#xD;
      epidural education classes attended the prescribed intervention. With 40% attendance the&#xD;
      authors of the study found a 14% difference in epidural utilization rates. Subjects in this&#xD;
      study will be randomized on labor and delivery after hospital admission. The investigators&#xD;
      estimate that 90% of women will get the assigned educational intervention. Assuming epidural&#xD;
      education has the same effect in this study as that seen in the abstract by Kanter et al. the&#xD;
      investigators expect to see a 31% increase in epidural utilization. Based upon data at OHSU&#xD;
      from June 2013 to May 2014 the current epidural rate at OHSU for Hispanics is 45.3% and the&#xD;
      current epidural rate for non-Hispanics is 55.8%. Assuming a 31% difference in epidural usage&#xD;
      in the Hispanic population after implementation of the study protocol, with an alpha of 0.05&#xD;
      and a power of 80%, 44 subjects would need to be randomized to each of four groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will compare the intervention to control group within both the Hispanic and&#xD;
      non-Hispanic populations on the primary outcome of neuraxial anesthesia utilization using the&#xD;
      chi-squared statistic. Pre and post delivery scores from the Neuraxial Anesthesia Survey will&#xD;
      be compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Subject characteristics between study arms&#xD;
      will be compared to one another with the chi-squared statistic or Fisher's Exact Test for&#xD;
      categorical outcomes and the student t test, or a non-parametric equivalent, for continuous&#xD;
      variables. A p &lt; 0.05 will be required to reject the null hypothesis that no difference&#xD;
      between epidural utilization rates exists between those that received the educational&#xD;
      intervention and those that did not.&#xD;
