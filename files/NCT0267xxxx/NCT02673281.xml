      The purposes of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Aim 1. To assess the mechanisms underlying the biological effects of short-term&#xD;
           walnut consumption on appetite with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and&#xD;
           assessing neurocognitive function/memory&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Aim 2. To investigate the effects of walnut consumption (48g per day over 5 days)&#xD;
           on appetite and satiety by analyzing molecules which regulate energy homeostasis such as&#xD;
           adipokines, as well as resting metabolic rate which measures energy expenditure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Aim 3. To investigate the effects of walnuts (48g per day over 5 days) on insulin&#xD;
           resistance, lipids, and inflammatory markers in obesity as well as the effect of walnuts&#xD;
           when consumed as part of a mixed meal, on glucose excursions, insulin secretion and the&#xD;
           excretion of gut peptides and free fatty acids.&#xD;

      Study Overview:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a short-term, pilot, double-blinded, randomized, cross-over inpatient study&#xD;
      testing the effects of either 48 g of walnuts per day vs. an ad libitum diet without walnuts&#xD;
      on appetite and satiety, insulin resistance, basal metabolic rate, lipids, adipokines, heart&#xD;
      rate, vascular reactivity, and markers of inflammation. The investigators propose that&#xD;
      subjects stay in the controlled environment of our Clinical Research Center (CRC) for the&#xD;
      entire duration of each arm of the study (5 days), which will be separated from the other arm&#xD;
      by a one month long wash out period. Walnuts/placebo administration will be in the form of a&#xD;
      milkshake with identical macronutrient content. Each study subject will be fed an identical&#xD;
      diet during both admissions to minimize variability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening: Potential subjects will be initially screened through telephone to determine that&#xD;
      they are eligible for inclusion in the study according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria.&#xD;
      If they pass the phone screening then they will be asked to come at CRC for a screening&#xD;
      visit. They will have a detailed medical history, physical exam, fasting lab tests such as&#xD;
      fructosamine, international normalized ratio (INR), prothrombin time (PT), complete blood&#xD;
      count (CBC), metabolic panel including glucose and lipid profile, electrocardiogram (EKG),&#xD;
      vitals, anthropometry and pregnancy test for women and if eligible for participation they&#xD;
      will sign the informed consent of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects meeting eligibility criteria will be randomized to start with either the active&#xD;
      intervention or placebo. Subjects will complete a 3-day food diary prior to visit 1 to&#xD;
      document baseline diet. They will also meet the dietitian who will advise them on following a&#xD;
      prudent diet and maintaining a stable exercise pattern for 2 weeks before the first visit and&#xD;
      between both visits. Subjects will also be advised to avoid walnuts during this period.&#xD;
      Subjects will also be required to maintain their weight +/- 3kg between screening and between&#xD;
      study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In-patient CRC Admission: In order to ensure stable study conditions, eligible subjects will&#xD;
      be asked to stay in the CRC of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) for a period&#xD;
      of 5 days on each of the study visits. They will receive advice on isocaloric diet but will&#xD;
      be allowed to eat ad libitum and will be randomized prior to the first visit regarding the&#xD;
      sequence of the study visits. All subjects will have 2 5-day visits to the CRC, one where&#xD;
      they receive active milkshake containing 48g of walnuts daily in a single morning meal&#xD;
      instead of breakfast, and another where they receive a &quot;placebo&quot; milkshake without nuts.&#xD;
      Subjects will have their hunger assessed using visual analog scales before breakfast, lunch&#xD;
      and dinner each day. These inpatient visits will be separated from each other by a 1-month&#xD;
      washout period. Subjects and investigators will be blinded regarding the study sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each of the inpatient series, subjects will be admitted to CRC the night before the first&#xD;
      day of the study. On day 1, subjects will have baseline measures such as vitals,&#xD;
      anthropometry, brief medical history, physical exam, pregnancy test for women. Prior to&#xD;
      leaving the CRC on day 5, subjects will again have vitals, blood draws for several markers&#xD;
      including fructosamine, lipid panel, high sensitivity c-reactive protein (hsCRP), adiponectin&#xD;
      and leptin, resting metabolic rate (RMR), anthropometry and body composition measures. On&#xD;
      this last day, they will also undergo neurocognitive testing and an fMRI at the fasting state&#xD;
      while viewing food cues and a mixed meal challenge either with or without walnuts. Subjects&#xD;
      will be discharged from the CRC after their final testing and after evaluating the milkshake&#xD;
      they were consuming on day 5 and will resume their normal diet for a period of 4 weeks after&#xD;
      which time they will return to the CRC for a further 5 days for the second study visit. Prior&#xD;
      Visit 2 participants will complete another 3-day food diary. If they received placebo&#xD;
      milkshake on the first visit, they will have the walnut milkshake on the second visit and&#xD;
      vice-versa.&#xD;
