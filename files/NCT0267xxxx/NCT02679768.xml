  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Very little is known of depressed patients' mental state after being discharged from&#xD;
      inpatient wards where they are provided with a sheltered environment with stable sleep wake&#xD;
      cycle, regular meals, and regular physical and social activities. Our previous usability&#xD;
      study, SAFE I, showed that electronic self-monitoring was a useful tool to gain insight into&#xD;
      patients' condition in the weeks after discharge. Results showed that patients over a four&#xD;
      week period had significant day to day variations in self-rated mood and sleeping schedule&#xD;
      and that the patients' sleep patterns were delayed with 45 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the actual study, SAFE II, we are investigating whether an intervention with a strong&#xD;
      focus on the circadian timing of daytime activities, and sleep, coined Circadian&#xD;
      Reinforcement Therapy (CRT), can lead to a faster recovery of depression and prevent relapse&#xD;
      into depression after discharge.&#xD;

      SAFE II Background Patients hospitalized with a depression are generally discharged within&#xD;
      4-6 weeks, but remain vulnerable, and not fully recovered at discharge, hence a majority will&#xD;
      be referred to outpatient care. Often, however, patients have to wait for about 2 weeks from&#xD;
      discharge to first visit in the outpatient clinic. Our clinical experience is that this&#xD;
      period from discharge to start of outpatient care is associated with psychological&#xD;
      uncertainty and often cause unstable daily routines for sleep, meals, social life, and&#xD;
      exercise. This may result in aggravation of the depression with the associated risk of&#xD;
      suicidal thoughts and readmission. Our first study &quot;E-monitoring by depression - Safe I,&quot;&#xD;
      illustrated these issues. Patients registered their state daily in an electronical&#xD;
      application, for sleep, mood, and exercise. Among other things the study showed that the&#xD;
      patients' sleep patterns were advanced to later in the evening and longer in the morning thus&#xD;
      shifting the sleep-wake cycle to later. One possible explanation for this finding is that&#xD;
      patients are not recovered from the depression when discharged and therefore are more&#xD;
      vulnerable to changes. Another possible factor is that at home the patients do not have the&#xD;
      same support to keep daily structure as during hospitalization. This project &quot;Safe discharge&#xD;
      - SafeII&quot; is based on the experience from the first study and will investigate whether a&#xD;
      focused intervention in the benefits of a stable sleep in the recovery of a depression can&#xD;
      help prevent worsening of the depression in the waiting time for outpatient treatment. It is&#xD;
      well documented that stable sleep and circadian rhythm is an important element in the&#xD;
      recovery of a depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim The purpose is to examine whether focused guidance to improve sleep habits and circadian&#xD;
      rhythms can speed up recovery and also prevent worsening of depression and thus prevent&#xD;
      readmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and Methods All patients hospitalized at PCK (Psychiatric Center Copenhagen) with a&#xD;
      unipolar depression, and referred to outpatient treatment at the Intensive outpatient unit&#xD;
      for affective disorders) (IAA) at discharge, are eligible for inclusion. Patient agreeing to&#xD;
      participate will be randomized to one of two groups. The standard care group consists of&#xD;
      patients who will be asked to register their mental state on a daily basis (mood, sleep and&#xD;
      exercise) in the electronical application Daybuilder (www.Daybuilder.com). This standard&#xD;
      group will have weekly telephone contact with the investigators. The intervention group will&#xD;
      also be asked to register their daily state in the Daybuilder app and have weekly telephone&#xD;
      contact with the investigators. In addition to standard care this group will also receive&#xD;
      individual guidance concerning the importance of stabilization of the sleep-wake cycle and&#xD;
      sleep to recover from depression. The primary outcomes of the study are changes in self-rated&#xD;
      mood and changes in Hamilton depression rating scores at baseline and endpoint in the two&#xD;
      groups and number of readmissions. We expect that the intervention group will have a more&#xD;
      rapid recovery of depression and have fewer readmissions. Furthermore, in a subset of&#xD;
      patients, the levels of the sleep hormone melatonin, a biological marker of circadian&#xD;
      rhythms, is measured, as a profile to establish the dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) at the&#xD;
      start and end of the intervention. At total of 150 patients, 75 in each group will be&#xD;
      included in the project over a three year period In this study we get the opportunity to see&#xD;
      the isolated impact of focusing on sleep and circadian rhythm in the recovery from&#xD;
      depression. We have coined this intervention Circadian Reinforcement Therapy (CRT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implications If the findings are positive, we expect to implement the intervention more&#xD;
      systematically in the psychiatric services thereby improving the conditions of patients with&#xD;
      depression by making the transition from in- to outpatient status less risky and more stable.&#xD;
      In the long term perspective the intervention can underpin recovery from depression, and&#xD;
      prevent relapse into depression and readmission in mental hospital.&#xD;
