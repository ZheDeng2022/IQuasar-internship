      Study name: THOR - Tübingen Choroideremia gene therapy trial open label Phase 2 clinical&#xD;
      trial using an adeno-associated viral vector (AAV2) encoding Rab-escort protein 1 (REP1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase: Phase II&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indication: Adult males with a clinical phenotype of choroideremia and a confirmed molecular&#xD;
      diagnosis of a null mutation in the gene encoding REP1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of study: To assess the anatomical and functional outcomes, as well as the safety of a&#xD;
      single subretinal injection of rAAV2.REP1 in subjects with genetically confirmed&#xD;
      choroideremia for up to 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint: Change from baseline in best corrected visual acuity in treated eye,&#xD;
      compared to untreated control eye&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Open label monocenter study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: 6 male adults affected by choroideremia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Participant is willing and able to give informed consent for participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Male aged 18 years or above.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Genetically confirmed diagnosis of choroideremia. Patients without a confirmed mutation&#xD;
           in the CHM gene, but who have the clinical phenotype typical of choroideremia can only&#xD;
           be enrolled if they meet all the following three criteria: (i) family history consistent&#xD;
           with X-linked inheritance, (ii) absent REP1 protein on Western blot of a blood sample&#xD;
           and, (iii) normal RPE65 gene on sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Active disease visible clinically within the macula region&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Best-corrected visual acuity equal to or worse than 6/9 (20/32; Decimal 0.63; LogMAR&#xD;
           0.2) but better than or equal to 6/60 (20/200; Decimal 0.1; LogMAR 1.0) in the study&#xD;
           eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Female and child participants (under the age of 18)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Participants with a history of amblyopia in the study eye&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Men unwilling to use barrier contraception methods, if relevant&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Absence of quantifiable visual function in the fellow eye or other ocular morbidity&#xD;
           which might confound use of the fellow eye as a long-term control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Any other significant ocular and non-ocular disease/disorder or retinal surgery which,&#xD;
           in the opinion of the Investigator, may either put the participants at risk because of&#xD;
           participation in the study, or may influence the results of the study, or the&#xD;
           participant's ability to participate in the study. This would include not taking or&#xD;
           having a contraindication to oral prednisolone, such as a history of gastric ulcer or&#xD;
           significant side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Participants who have participated in another research study involving an&#xD;
           investigational product in the past 12 weeks, or having had gene or cellular therapy at&#xD;
           any time prior to this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Patients with amblyopic eyes should be excluded in general, since the evaluation of the&#xD;
           primary endpoint presupposes the ability to fixate both eyes&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Prior intraocular surgery within six months&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Intolerance to local anesthesia and/or contraindication to IVT surgery (anemia Hb&lt;8g/dl,&#xD;
           severe cardiovascular disease, severe coagulopathy, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. High fever or high fever disease, patients with a history of autoimmune conditions/&#xD;
           other systemic diseases that may have ocular manifestations (e.g. sarcoidosis) or&#xD;
           neurodegenerative conditions (e.g. multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica, Parkinson's&#xD;
           disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Patients suffering from other genetic mutations leading to pathological retinal&#xD;
           conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Patients treated by oral corticoids within 14 days prior inclusion at the study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient number: 6&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment: Each participant will receive a single treatment of the rAAV2.REP1 vector (0.1ml&#xD;
      containing 1011 AAV2 genome particles) administered by subretinal injection during a&#xD;
      vitrectomy operation. No placebo will be used. ln order to minimize selection bias both eyes&#xD;
      are randomized to either treatment or control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main criteria: Primary endpoint: Change from baseline in best corrected visual acuity in&#xD;
      treated eye, compared to untreated control eye up to 24 months after vector administration&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints: Absence of vector related adverse reactions 24 months after vector&#xD;
      administration. Demonstration of improved retinal anatomy and/or visual function other than&#xD;
      best corrected visual acuity in treated eye compared to the untreated control eye 24 months&#xD;
      after vector administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary statistics will be presented for both eyes (Treated Eye versus Control Eye groups).&#xD;
      No formal statistical comparison will be performed (no p-value will be computed). For&#xD;
      categorical/binary data, the number and proportion of patients in each category will be&#xD;
      presented with its 95% Confidence Interval (CI). For continuous data, mean (and its 95% CI)&#xD;
      and Standard Deviation (SD) will be presented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure will be the proportion of patients with a relative change from&#xD;
      baseline of &gt; 5 in ETDRS letters (treated vs. untreated eye, change from BL). At each time&#xD;
      point, the change from baseline in ETDRS letters will be computed for each eye. The mean&#xD;
      change from baseline in ETDRS letters will be presented for both the treated eye and the&#xD;
      control eye groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each time point, the change from baseline and the percentage change from baseline in the&#xD;
      area of autofluoresence will be computed for each eye and their mean will be presented for&#xD;
      both the treated eye and the control eye groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With regards to microperimetry, at each time point, the change from baseline in mean&#xD;
      sensitivity will be computed for each eye. The mean change from baseline in mean sensitivity&#xD;
      will be presented for both the treated eye and the control eye groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events will be listed. Other Investigator Sponsored Studies are expected to be run&#xD;
      with a similar protocol for the same indication and with the same intervention. A&#xD;
      meta-analysis on the Investigator Sponsored studies is planned. A separate Statistical&#xD;
      Analysis Plan describing the details of the meta-analysis will be developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timetable:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned trial period: 24 month Follow-up duration: 36 month&#xD;
&#xD;
      The end of trial is the date on which the last treated patient completes the tests of their&#xD;
      planned close-out visit.&#xD;
