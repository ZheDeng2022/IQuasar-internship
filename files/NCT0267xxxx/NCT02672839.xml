      The purpose of this study is to compare relative oral bioavailability of a capsule&#xD;
      formulation of LGD-6972 to a solution formulation of LGD-6972.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, randomized, open-label, single dose study conducted in a 2-way&#xD;
      crossover design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 8 subjects will be enrolled in the study. The duration of participation for each&#xD;
      subject will be approximately 36 days, not including a Screening Period of up to 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each treatment period, subjects will be admitted to the study site on Day -1 and observed&#xD;
      through the morning of Day 3 (48-hour post-dose assessment). Over 2 treatment periods,&#xD;
      subjects will receive each of the following treatments as a single dose orally, under fasting&#xD;
      conditions, per the randomization (4 subjects per treatment in each treatment period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment A - 15 mg of LGD-6972 as capsules&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment B - 15 mg LGD-6972 as solution&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serial blood samples will be collected through 48 hours following each dose to determine the&#xD;
      concentration of LGD 6972 in plasma. Safety assessments will also occur during this time.&#xD;
      Subjects will be discharged from the study site after the 48 hour assessments and return to&#xD;
      the study site on Days 4, 7, and 14 for follow up procedures. Subjects will return to the&#xD;
      study site for the second treatment period after an additional 7 days. Subjects will be&#xD;
      discharged from the study after returning to the study site on Day 14 of the second treatment&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
