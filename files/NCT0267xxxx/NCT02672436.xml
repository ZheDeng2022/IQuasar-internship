        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. With either gender aged at least 20 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. With diagnosed diabetic mellitus (DM), e.g. currently under DM medication treatment or&#xD;
             na√Øve DM subject with duplicated HbA1c over 6.5% and fasting plasma glucose over 126&#xD;
             mg/dL measured at least one week apart before Screening)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. With at least one cutaneous ulcer on the foot (including ulcers on the lower legs) and&#xD;
             not healing for at least 4 weeks. The largest diabetic foot ulcer will be selected as&#xD;
             target ulcer. If two or more ulcers have the largest size, the one with worst grade&#xD;
             will be selected. If two or more ulcers have the largest size and grade, the one with&#xD;
             longest duration will be selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The target ulcer is classified as grade 1 to 3 ulcer according to Wagner Grading&#xD;
             System and with ulcer size of 1 cm2 to 36 cm2 (Grade 3 ulcer subject may enter the&#xD;
             study only if after debridement, the abscess of target ulcer is under control at&#xD;
             investigator's discretion and osteomyelitis does not present)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Diabetic foot ulcers should be free of any necrosis or infection in any soft tissue&#xD;
             and bone tissue;&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subject has signed the written informed consent form&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. With active osteomyelitis&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. With target ulcer size decreased by at least 30% after at least 2 weeks of&#xD;
             standard-of-care-only period or any other recorded regular therapy either before&#xD;
             Screening visit or after completing Initial Phase&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. With poor nutritional status (albumin &lt; 2g/dl), poor diabetic control (HbA1c &gt; 12%), a&#xD;
             leukocyte counts &lt; 2,000/mm3, abnormal liver function (AST, ALT&gt;3 x upper limit of&#xD;
             normal range) within 14 days before Screening visit or 28 days before Randomization&#xD;
             visit Note: HbA1c: hemoglobin A1c; AST: aspartate aminotransferase; ALT: alanine&#xD;
             aminotransferase&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids, immunosuppressive or&#xD;
             chemotherapeutic agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. With known or suspected hypersensitivity to any ingredients of study product and&#xD;
             vehicle&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. With coronary heart disease with myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass graft&#xD;
             (CABG), or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) within 3 months prior&#xD;
             to study&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Pregnant or lactating or premenopausal with childbearing potential but not taking&#xD;
             reliable contraceptive method(s) during the study period Note: Women with childbearing&#xD;
             potential should agree to use a highly effective method of birth control, defined as&#xD;
             those, alone or in combination, that result in a low failure rate when used&#xD;
             consistently and correctly.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. With the following conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. ankle brachial index (ABI) &lt; 0.4 OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. ABI between 0.4 and 0.6 (inclusive) and not received appropriate treatment for&#xD;
                  improving venous and arterial insufficiency Note: Subjects with ABI between 0.4&#xD;
                  and 0.6 (inclusive) and having received appropriate surgical or&#xD;
                  endovenous/endovascular therapy for improving venous and arterial insufficiency&#xD;
                  considered by investigators such as valvuloplasty, angioplasty, or bypass&#xD;
                  grafting will be eligible to enter the study at investigator's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Enrollment in any investigational drug trial within 4 weeks before entering this study&#xD;
