      Objectives: The purpose of this proposal is to evaluate the impact of the CNH Dashboard&#xD;
      implementation on the quality of VA Purchased CNH care relative to other CNH facilities, and&#xD;
      to evaluate the quality of Veteran-specific care in purchased CNH facilities by transition&#xD;
      and safety outcome measures derived from Veteran-specific CMS data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The investigators will evaluate the effect of the CNH Dashboard release in a&#xD;
      randomized, stepped-wedge dissemination. This dissemination design allows us to determine the&#xD;
      impact of the CNH Dashboard on the quality of purchased CNH facility more systematically than&#xD;
      a single phase roll-out. In each of the 4 steps, The investigators will release the CNH&#xD;
      Dashboard to a randomly selected set of VISNs. Dashboard release will be accompanied by&#xD;
      education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Findings: The CNH Dashboard has actionable information to leaders in GEC at the local,&#xD;
      regional, and national levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact: When completed, this program will improve the quality of care Veterans receive in VA&#xD;
      purchased CNH programs as demonstrated by improved selection of CNH facilities and&#xD;
      Veteran-specific measures.&#xD;

      Objective: To evaluate the impact of the CNH Dashboard implementation on the quality of&#xD;
      contracted CNHs relative to non-contracted CNH in a VAMC Market.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stepped wedge Dashboard Implementation The investigators propose a stepped wedge&#xD;
      implementation of the CNH Dashboard, randomized at the VISN level (n=3-4 per period). The&#xD;
      stepped wedge allows for maximization of GEC resources with a systematic roll out to provide&#xD;
      sufficient education to every randomized VISN (see education program below). Every 3 months,&#xD;
      we will bring a new randomized group of VISNs 'online' with the CNH Dashboard (Table 2). The&#xD;
      investigators selected the VISN level as a unit of randomization, because there is&#xD;
      integration between VAMCs within a VISN. With approximately 4 VAMCs in each VISN, this&#xD;
      release schedule is robust, but manageable with support from this award. The investigators&#xD;
      will pilot test the CNH Dashboard in 3 VISNs to finalize the information upload, dashboard,&#xD;
      and educational program.&#xD;

      Dashboard Hosting The CNH Dashboard will be hosted on a VA GEC intranet website. The&#xD;
      advantage of a intranet site is that it allows controlled access to the site for the stepped&#xD;
      wedge implementation. As the project continues, the investigators will enlist the assistance&#xD;
      of the Indianapolis VAMC Center for Applied Systems Engineering to guide the transition&#xD;
      toward an electronic dashboard that is accessible throughout the VA intranet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Educational Program The investigators will design an educational program with the goals of a)&#xD;
      understanding about the quality of CNH as presented in the five star rating system, b)&#xD;
      orientation to the dashboard, c) identifying low performing CNH facilities, and d) available&#xD;
      options for contracting with higher quality facilities. This educational program will include&#xD;
      elements of didactic training, as well as coaching throughout the implementation. The&#xD;
      effectiveness of this educational program will be determined by anonymous participant survey.&#xD;
      The education program will be rolled out to VISN and facility geriatric program leaders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Analysis While the investigators are randomizing by VISN, the investigators will&#xD;
      analyze by VAMC, because that is where purchased CNH selection occurs. For each VAMC, we will&#xD;
      measure the ratio of the average quality of purchased CNH facilities (observed) to&#xD;
      non-contracted CNH (expected) in the VAMC market. The VAMC average observed to expected (O/E)&#xD;
      ratio will serve as the primary measure for this analysis. The primary reference baseline&#xD;
      period will consist of the average O/E in the 6 months prior to CNH Dashboard implementation.&#xD;
      The intervention period, during which the CNH Dashboard is released to the randomized group,&#xD;
      will last for 3 months during which the educational program will be delivered and assessed.&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be the average O/E in the 12 months after the roll out period ends.&#xD;
      Each VAMC will act as their own control. Our primary analyses will consist of the VAMC&#xD;
      average O/E ratio of Contracted CNH facilities in the 6 months prior to the intervention and&#xD;
      the 12 months post-intervention (Figure 6). From Figure 3, the investigators expect that this&#xD;
      will be a normal distribution and, therefore, will use a Student's t-test to compare the&#xD;
      average O/E ratios.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, CNH contracts are generally written with annual renewals of a 5-year master&#xD;
      contract. Thus, if quality is low, a contract can be discontinued annually. However, there is&#xD;
      substantial overhead in establishing a 5-year contract. While the investigators do not expect&#xD;
      the CNH quality to be the only measure of CNH selection, we anticipate that it will become a&#xD;
      factor in non-renewal and new contract initiation. Presently, each VAMC contracts with an&#xD;
      average of 12 CNHs and thus, there are 2-3 facilities per year which are up for contract.&#xD;
      Changing the contracting process will take time and with GEC resources; the investigators are&#xD;
      thus committed to follow up for 12 months for each of the four groups after CNH Dashboard&#xD;
      roll out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Analysis To protect the internal validity of the stepped wedge implementation, the&#xD;
      investigators must perform secondary analyses with additional reference periods.12 This helps&#xD;
      to account for secular trends and intervening events which can influence the study outcome.&#xD;
      For example, if CMS were to revise the criteria for the 5-star ranking system downward during&#xD;
      the CNH Dashboard implementation, the investigators would introduce a type 2 error (incorrect&#xD;
      acceptance of the null). In addition to the changes in contracted CNH quality as the&#xD;
      dashboard is released, the investigators expect that there will be movement toward higher&#xD;
      quality facilities among VAMCs prior to their randomized roll out. This change is a result of&#xD;
      VAMCs taking action because they know they are being examined with respect to their&#xD;
      contracted CNH quality prior to seeing the CNH Dashboard. VAMCs will either pressure&#xD;
      contracted CNHs to improve or change contracting practices. As a result, we expect that the&#xD;
      O/E ratio will rise naturally during the course of the study. Additionally, secular trends in&#xD;
      CNH selection, VA approval for fee authority, OIG investigations, news stories, and VA&#xD;
      organizational decisions could influence the selection and focus on CNH quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address this natural change, the investigators propose secondary analyses with additional&#xD;
      reference periods. Our first additional reference period for the randomized groups will be&#xD;
      the O/E in the 6 months prior to CNH Dashboard implementation (months -6 to 0), which will be&#xD;
      compared to the O/E of the primary analysis period. Second, we will examine the change O/E&#xD;
      for the primary reference period. We will compare the O/E of randomized group 1 to the other&#xD;
      randomized groups using Student's t-tests to determine if there has been significant baseline&#xD;
      change over the course of the evaluation. Finally, the investigators will examine the O/E in&#xD;
      the reference period as a function of time. This will particularly pertain to Groups 3 and 4&#xD;
      which have a longer window (12 and 15 months respectively) by which we can examine the&#xD;
      temporal change in O/E without the intervention.&#xD;
