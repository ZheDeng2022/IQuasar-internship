      Previous work has determined that there are significant differences in the communities of&#xD;
      bacteria found in the airways of asthmatic patients compared to those found in the airways of&#xD;
      healthy people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is not yet clear if these bacterial communities are similar in all patients with asthma or&#xD;
      if they are different in people with more severe asthma, with different types of asthma or&#xD;
      between asthma patients taking different treatment. This is important to know as any&#xD;
      differences in the bacteria present between groups may help to explain why people with asthma&#xD;
      do not have the same features of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research aims to determine if there are any differences in the number and type of&#xD;
      bacteria found in the airways of asthmatic patients (1) with different severities of asthma&#xD;
      and (2) who use different types of inhaled steroid treatment for asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will do this by detecting the DNA of bacteria present in phlegm samples from these&#xD;
      patients. We will also take measurements of the different components of asthma to see if the&#xD;
      bacteria are different in people with different types of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As it is not yet clear if the bacteria detected in phlegm samples from one person may differ&#xD;
      on different occasions, we will be taking more than one sample from some patients to see how&#xD;
      similar this is over time.&#xD;

      The main aim of this project is to determine if microbiota composition is correlated with&#xD;
      disease severity (as determined by BTS step). Although initial studies suggest that&#xD;
      asthmatics of different severities may have similar microbiota composition, there is no&#xD;
      direct evidence to support this assertion. Also, the three main studies in this area so far&#xD;
      have all used different sequencing methods, making comparisons difficult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relationship between the microbiota composition of different subjects and clinical&#xD;
      measures including bronchial hyperreactivity (as measured by methacholine challenge) and&#xD;
      pattern of airway inflammation (as measured by sputum differential cell count and exhaled&#xD;
      nitric oxide levels) will be investigated further. Comparisons will also be made between&#xD;
      samples from asthmatic patients using the inhaled steroid fluticasone and those using&#xD;
      budesonide, as there is evidence suggesting that fluticasone leads to an increased risk of&#xD;
      pneumonia and non tuberculous mycobacterial disease in certain patient groups. Unpublished&#xD;
      data (Astra Zeneca) suggests the excess risk of pneumonia with fluticasone compared to&#xD;
      budesonide may be more pronounced after at least 12 months of treatment with inhaled&#xD;
      corticosteroid. Microbiota composition of the sputum samples will be evaluated in conjunction&#xD;
      with standard microbiological culture of these samples to allow a comparison between these&#xD;
      two methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to assess the reproducibility of the induced sputum method for assessing the lung&#xD;
      microbiota, a repeat sputum sample will be taken from a subgroup of 20 patients within 24&#xD;
      hours of the collection of the first sample and compared. A further sample will be taken from&#xD;
      this subgroup of patients 2 weeks later to assess the longitudinal stability of the bacterial&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
