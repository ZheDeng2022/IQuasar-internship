    <textblock>
      Lowering the level of uric acid in the serum under 6mg/dL on the long term is a key factor of&#xD;
      gout management success. Monitoring of uricemia in gout patients is therefore important and&#xD;
      is presently done in the laboratory on serum samples obtained after venous puncture. This&#xD;
      study aims at assessing the reliability of immediate uricemia measurement in a blood sample&#xD;
      obtained by a mere fingertip puncture, by the HumaSensplus system, which is commercially&#xD;
      available in the EU. Results obtained by the Humasens device will be compared to those of the&#xD;
      standard measurement technique in serum and with a reference technique (liquid chromatography&#xD;
      and mass spectroscopy). If the device appears reliable, it will allow self-measurement of&#xD;
      uric acid by the gouty patient, in a similar way as diabetic patients measure their glycaemia&#xD;
      following a fingertip puncture. This should improve patient monitoring and management&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;

      The aim of this study is&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to assess the validity of the capillary measure of uric acid level by the HumaSens plus&#xD;
           system by comparing the measurement of total blood uric acid level by the HumaSens plus&#xD;
           system with the routine measurement of serum uric acid by a standard and validated&#xD;
           automated colorimetric method (primary objective).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to look for a systematic bias and confounding factors (secondary objectives)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design : This is a mono-centric prospective study. Patients will be recruited from the&#xD;
      diabetology day hospital of hospital Lariboisière, Paris&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection : For each patient included at the Lariboisière Diabetology day hospital and&#xD;
      included in this study, serum uric acid levels will be measured once from venous blood&#xD;
      samples in the biochemistry laboratory using standard automated colorimetric methods, as&#xD;
      presently routinely done and by liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectroscopy. In,&#xD;
      addition, uric acid levels will also be simultaneously measured from capillary blood with the&#xD;
      HumaSensplus system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hematocrit, glucose, cholesterol and triglycerides will be measured as well from venous blood&#xD;
      samples and taken medications will be listed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned analysis :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To obtain an estimated intraclass correlation of 0,800, with a two-sided 95% confidence&#xD;
      interval with a width of 0,100, if the uric acid level is measured twice for each subject, we&#xD;
      calculated that we needed a random sample of 204 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary aim This study aims at studying the reliability of measurements of acid uric level by&#xD;
      HumanSensplus against laboratory and measurements by liquid chromatography coupled with mass&#xD;
      spectroscopy on serum from venous blood. There is no structure to the replicate measurements&#xD;
      in the sense that nothing ties the first or second measurement on one patient to the first or&#xD;
      second on another. The study thus conforms to a one-way random effect model. The data will be&#xD;
      analyzed using a one-way random-effects ANOVA model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The estimator of the intraclass correlation coefficient will be&#xD;
&#xD;
      With BMS=between-subject mean square, WMS=within-subject mean square and k0 = number of&#xD;
      replicates. In this study k0=2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intraclass correlation coefficient will be calculated and the two-sided 95%CI will be&#xD;
      provided for each comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition differences between measurements will be plotted against mean of measurements in&#xD;
      accordance with Bland and Altman.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims The search for systematic bias and effect of confounding factors (hematocrit,&#xD;
      glycemia, lipid concentrations and concomitant medications) will use different models of&#xD;
      multiple regression&#xD;
&#xD;
      Logistic aspects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical aspects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Agreement will be sought from the local Ethics committee. All patients will be fully informed&#xD;
      and will be provided with an information form. The data will be entered into an excel&#xD;
      database and will be analysed anonymously. Fingertip glycaemia is presently systematically&#xD;
      obtained in all these day hospital patients, and the addition of fingertip uricaemia in view&#xD;
      of substituting this measurement to the systematic serum uric acid measurement presently done&#xD;
      from a venous system in the biochemistry laboratory can be considered as a mere attempt to&#xD;
      improve routine patient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will target 200 patients seen in diabetology day hospitalisation and fulfilling the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria. As 15 patients are seen in the diabetology day hospitalisation ward every&#xD;
      day, we estimate that the necessary patients sample size could be obtained within 6 weeks.&#xD;
