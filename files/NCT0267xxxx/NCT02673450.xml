      This study investigates a possible relationship between disturbance of the cyclic expression&#xD;
      of ten different clock genes and development of delirium in patients admitted to an intensive&#xD;
      care unit&#xD;
&#xD;
      It also investigates a possible relationship between disturbance of the cyclic expression of&#xD;
      melatonin and development of delirium in patients admitted to an intensive care unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally a possible relationship between genetic differences in the PER3 gene and development&#xD;
      of delirium is investigated.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      An increasing number of patients are treated at ICUs worldwide. The majority of these&#xD;
      patients survive critical illness and are discharged from hospital. In recent decades,&#xD;
      improved therapy and survival at ICUs has increased focus on long term outcomes and post-ICU&#xD;
      rehabilitation. Both physical and mental problems following admission for ICU therapy can be&#xD;
      found for years after discharge. It is therefore important to discover factors that may have&#xD;
      a significant impact for a worsened outcome, in order to prevent and treat these impairments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive deficiencies may affect large proportions of the post intensive care population and&#xD;
      mild cognitive impairment was demonstrated for up to 40% of the patients when evaluated three&#xD;
      months after discharge. Recovery was slow and at one year follow up, 25% of the patients&#xD;
      still showed impairment comparable to mild traumatic brain injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of delirium during ICU stay has been associated with a worsened cognitive&#xD;
      outcome at both 3 and 12 months follow up. Both patient's global cognition and especially&#xD;
      executive function was impaired. Furthermore, a longer duration of the delirium period was&#xD;
      associated with a poorer cognitive function. Incidence of delirium has also shown association&#xD;
      to higher mortality rates and a longer hospital stay when compared to patients without&#xD;
      delirium. In previous studies, the second day of admission has had the highest incidence of&#xD;
      delirium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alterations in sleep architecture with a more shallow sleep and disruptions of the sleep wake&#xD;
      cycle, is common in both ICU patients and patients with delirium. Sleep deprivation is often&#xD;
      seen in delirious patients, and consequently, it has been suggested to be a risk factor for&#xD;
      development of delirium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The circadian rhythm is an inborn cycle of biological activity based on 24 hour intervals,&#xD;
      and the rhythmicity interacts with sleep homeostasis in order to regulate sleep-wake cycles&#xD;
      of individuals. In humans, the circadian rhythm is controlled by the suprachiasmatic nucleus&#xD;
      (SCN) (the circadian clock) mediating melatonin secretion from the pineal gland to regulate&#xD;
      the sleep-wake cycle. A number of factors, especially daylight, influence the SCN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When blue light (460-480 nm wavelengths) reaches the retina and excites photoreceptors, it&#xD;
      communicates with the pineal gland and secretion of melatonin is reduced to a minimum.&#xD;
      Melatonin is secreted at night when blue light is absent and promotes sleep by activation of&#xD;
      melatonin receptors. Melatonin secretion also interacts with a number of body functions,&#xD;
      including core body temperature and the cardiac and immune systems. It is one of the key&#xD;
      molecules in circadian rhythmicity. The circadian rhythm is not only affected by light, but&#xD;
      is also synchronized by other factors, including shift work, artificial light exposure and&#xD;
      exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of genetic markers known as clock genes play a major role in the circadian control&#xD;
      of different processes in the body. These genes may determine an individual's chronotype&#xD;
      (morningness/eveningness), sensitivity to sleep disturbance and sleep deprivation, but much&#xD;
      of their significance and function is still unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A group of genes named PERIOD genes are shown to be involved in determining individual sleep&#xD;
      wake regulation. PERIOD3 (PER3) is found in three subtypes: PER3 4/4, PER3 4/5 and PER3 5/5.&#xD;
      The numbers refer to a variable number of tandem repeat polymorphism where a motif of 54&#xD;
      nucleotides is repeated for 4 or 5 U. Studies in large populations have shown 10% of&#xD;
      individuals to be homozygous for the 5'-variation, 50% for the 4'-variation and 40% to be&#xD;
      heterozygous.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with homozygosity of the long allele (PER35/5) have more slow wave sleep and longer&#xD;
      sleep duration compared to the other sub-types. Though no difference in melatonin or cortisol&#xD;
      levels where seen, the two types reacted very differently to sleep deprivation. PER35/5&#xD;
      individuals performed poorly on a variety of cognitive tests compared to PER34/4. This&#xD;
      information might help to identify subgroups of patients especially sensitive to development&#xD;
      of delirium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent study explored the relationship between PER3 genotype and postoperative cognitive&#xD;
      dysfunction and did not find an association. The distribution of PER3 subtypes were as&#xD;
      expected from previous studies. However, a possible association between PER 3 genotypes and&#xD;
      cognitive dysfunction has never been investigated in ICU patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of other genes are involved in the circadian rhythm. These genes are expressed in a&#xD;
      rhythmic manner following the natural light/dark cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In healthy subjects, severely disturbed expression of the clock genes Clock, Cry1-2, Per1-3,&#xD;
      Rorα, Bmal1, Rev-erb and CSNK1ε has been demonstrated after injection of endotoxin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In septic ICU patients, a desynchronised expression of Cry-1 and Per-2 has been demonstrated.&#xD;
      This disturbance was linked to secretion of proinflammatory cytokines as tumor necrosis&#xD;
      factor α (TNFα) and interleukin 6 (IL-6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The implication of the above is that if a disturbed circadian rhythm can be demonstrated to&#xD;
      be associated with patients in delirium, we might in the future be able to identify patients&#xD;
      with a higher risk of developing delirium - even in comatose or heavily sedated patients.&#xD;
      Something which is not possible with the current diagnostic methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we therefore wish to investigate the relationship between PER3 gene&#xD;
      polymorphism and incidence of delirium. This may help to identify patient groups at a higher&#xD;
      risk of developing delirium and potentially prevent or treat these patients at an earlier&#xD;
      stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The other objective is to identify differences in melatonin and cyclic gene expression in&#xD;
      delirious patients, compared to other critically ill patients. This may be a new perspective&#xD;
      for the diagnosis of delirium in heavily sedated patients.&#xD;
