  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 20 (CCL20) is a protein involved in attracting immune cells&#xD;
      including subsets of T cells (for example Th17 cells), B cells, natural killer cells and&#xD;
      dendritic cells to inflamed tissues in conditions such as psoriasis (Ps) and psoriatic&#xD;
      arthritis (PsA). CCL20 acts by binding and activating the chemokine receptor 6 (CCR6) present&#xD;
      on the surface of the inflammatory cells. Levels of CCL20 are increased in inflamed tissues&#xD;
      in psoriasis (Ps) and inflammatory arthritis. GSK3050002 is a humanized Immunoglobulin G&#xD;
      (Ig)G monoclonal antibody, which binds to and neutralizes the action of human CCL20. The&#xD;
      hypothesis is that GSK3050002 will reduce the movement of inflammatory cells into tissues&#xD;
      affected by Ps or PsA, thereby leading to an improvement in disease activity. The primary&#xD;
      objective of this multi-centre, randomized, double-blind (sponsor open), placebo-controlled&#xD;
      trial is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of repeat doses of GSK3050002, and to&#xD;
      understand the mechanism of action (by taking skin and synovial biopsy samples) and potential&#xD;
      for clinical efficacy of GSK3050002 in subjects with PsA. A minimum of 18 subjects and up to&#xD;
      a maximum of 30 subjects will be randomised into the study to either GSK3050002 or placebo in&#xD;
      a 2:1 ratio to ensure that approximately 18 evaluable subjects complete the study. The total&#xD;
      duration of participation in the study will be approximately 21 weeks from screening to last&#xD;
      study visit.&#xD;

             whilst receiving GSK3050002 based on an assessment of the benefit: risk (e.g. risk of&#xD;
             Therapy Time period decreased responsiveness). Investigators are expected to follow&#xD;
