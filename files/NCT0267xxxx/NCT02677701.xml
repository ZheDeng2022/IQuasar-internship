    <textblock>
      This is a study to examine the effect of combining chronic oral azithromycin with inhaled&#xD;
      tobramycin in adolescent and adult subjects with cystic fibrosis who are chronically infected&#xD;
      with P. aeruginosa.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of&#xD;
      azithromycin 500mg taken orally thrice weekly vs. placebo in subjects with cystic fibrosis&#xD;
      and chronic airway infection with P. aeruginosa who are utilizing chronic inhaled tobramycin&#xD;
      therapy. It will include approximately 120 subjects able to complete a primary 6-week study&#xD;
      phase. Subjects will be at least 12 years old with a baseline forced expiratory volume at one&#xD;
      second (FEV1) between 25-100% predicted. Subjects will continue to use clinically prescribed&#xD;
      inhaled tobramycin cycled on/off every 4 weeks. They will be provided over-encapsulated&#xD;
      azithromycin 500mg tablets or placebo during the primary study phase. An optional extension&#xD;
      phase will be offered to all subjects completing the primary 6-week study. This 8-week&#xD;
      extension phase will include an initial 4 weeks without use of inhaled tobramycin or other&#xD;
      inhaled antibiotics, followed by a 4-week period with inhaled tobramycin use. All subjects&#xD;
      participating in the extension phase of the study will be provided azithromycin 500mg tablets&#xD;
      to be taken thrice weekly for the entire 8-week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will investigate how use of chronic oral azithromycin affects some of the&#xD;
      previously demonstrated benefits to health when using inhaled tobramycin. The primary&#xD;
      measurements will focus on lung function. Additional measurements will focus on&#xD;
      disease-related quality of life as reported by subjects in the trial. Exploratory outcomes,&#xD;
      including measurements of safety, are also planned.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Cystic Fibrosis Respiratory Symptom Diary - Chronic Respiratory Infection Symptom Score (CFRSD-CRISS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (week 0) to week 6 (6 week period)</time_frame>
    <description>Absolute change in CFRSD-CRISS from enrollment at week 0 to the end of the 4-week period with inhaled tobramycin at week 6. The Cystic Fibrosis Respiratory Symptoms Diary asks a participant to state the extent of 8 respiratory symptoms: difficulty breathing, feverishness, tiredness, chills or sweats, coughing, coughing up mucus, tightness in the chest, and wheezing. Each respiratory symptom is assigned a score from 0-4 based on the response, with zero corresponding to the absence of the symptom and four corresponding to symptom being present &quot;a great deal&quot; or &quot;extremely.&quot; A summed score (ranging from 0-24) is calculated for each participant and converted to a final score with a range of 0 to 100, where lower scores indicate improvement of symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Change in Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire - Revised Respiratory Symptom Score (CFQ-R RSS)</measure>

    <description>Absolute change in the CFQ-R RSS from enrollment at week 0 to the end of the 4-week period with inhaled tobramycin at week 6. Age appropriate versions of Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire - Revised ask a participant from 4 to 6 questions related to respiratory symptoms. The Respiratory Domain Scaled Score is calculated as follows: 100*[sum of {responses-1}] / [{number of responses}*3] only if [number of responses] ≥ [number of possible responses]/2; otherwise the score is set to missing. The scaled score ranges from 0 to 100 and higher scores indicate improvement of symptoms.</description>

        <title>Change in Cystic Fibrosis Respiratory Symptom Diary - Chronic Respiratory Infection Symptom Score (CFRSD-CRISS)</title>
        <description>Absolute change in CFRSD-CRISS from enrollment at week 0 to the end of the 4-week period with inhaled tobramycin at week 6. The Cystic Fibrosis Respiratory Symptoms Diary asks a participant to state the extent of 8 respiratory symptoms: difficulty breathing, feverishness, tiredness, chills or sweats, coughing, coughing up mucus, tightness in the chest, and wheezing. Each respiratory symptom is assigned a score from 0-4 based on the response, with zero corresponding to the absence of the symptom and four corresponding to symptom being present &quot;a great deal&quot; or &quot;extremely.&quot; A summed score (ranging from 0-24) is calculated for each participant and converted to a final score with a range of 0 to 100, where lower scores indicate improvement of symptoms.</description>

        <description>Absolute change in the CFQ-R RSS from enrollment at week 0 to the end of the 4-week period with inhaled tobramycin at week 6. Age appropriate versions of Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire - Revised ask a participant from 4 to 6 questions related to respiratory symptoms. The Respiratory Domain Scaled Score is calculated as follows: 100*[sum of {responses-1}] / [{number of responses}*3] only if [number of responses] ≥ [number of possible responses]/2; otherwise the score is set to missing. The scaled score ranges from 0 to 100 and higher scores indicate improvement of symptoms.</description>
