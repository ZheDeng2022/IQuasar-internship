  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH) is a type of cancer that can damage tissue or cause&#xD;
      lesions to form in one or more places in the body. Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a&#xD;
      cancer that begins in LCH cells (a type of dendritic cell which fights infection). Sometimes&#xD;
      there are mutations (changes) in LCH cells as they form. These include mutations of the BRAF&#xD;
      gene. These changes may make the LCH cells grow and multiply quickly. This causes LCH cells&#xD;
      to build up in certain parts of the body, where they can damage tissue or form lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For most patients with LCH, standard-of-care vinblastine/prednisone are used as front-line&#xD;
      therapy while cytarabine therapy has been used as therapy for patients who develop&#xD;
      recurrence. No alternate treatment strategy has been developed for frontline therapy in LCH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research study is to compare previously used vinblastine/prednisone to&#xD;
      single therapy with cytarabine for LCH. We will evaluate the utility of an imaging study&#xD;
      called a positron emission tomography (PET) scan to more accurately assess areas of LCH&#xD;
      involvement not otherwise seen in other imaging studies as well as response to therapy. We&#xD;
      also want to identify if genetic and other biomarkers (special proteins in patient's blood&#xD;
      and in patient's cancer) relate to the response of patients LCH to study treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To be eligible to participate in this study, patients physician must have determined that&#xD;
      they have LCH which is not treatable by surgical intervention or observation alone. If&#xD;
      patient chooses to participate in this study, they will be assigned randomly (like flipping a&#xD;
      coin) to one of two LCH chemotherapy treatment groups. A computer will randomly determine if&#xD;
      they will begin to receive vinblastine/prednisone treatment or cytarabine treatment. Patient&#xD;
      will have an equal chance (50%) to receive vinblastine/prednisone or to receive cytarabine.&#xD;
      Neither the patient nor their doctor will be able to choose the group assignment, but the&#xD;
      patient and their study doctor will know which treatment they are receiving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will need to have the following tests, exams, or procedures. Most of these are&#xD;
      part of regular cancer care and may be done even if the patient does not want to join this&#xD;
      study. Some of them may not need to be repeated if they have had them done recently. The&#xD;
      patient's doctor will tell them which ones they need to repeat.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History and Physical&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biopsy to confirm diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bone Marrow biopsy/aspirate (if patient is less than 2 years old or for any patient&#xD;
           clinical concern for bone marrow disease)*&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lumbar puncture for spinal fluid tests (if patient has disease in pituitary gland or&#xD;
           brain)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The bone marrow sample procedure is as follows: The skin above the hipbone will be&#xD;
                made numb. This area will then be sterilized and a small incision will be made. A&#xD;
                bone marrow needle will be inserted into the hipbone and bone marrow will be&#xD;
                withdrawn. Patient will sign a separate consent that explains this procedure in&#xD;
                more detail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also do x-rays and scans of the inside of the body. These scans may include chest and&#xD;
      bone x-rays, ultrasound, computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
      and/or positron emission tomography (PET). The specific tests depend on age, sites of LCH and&#xD;
      other clinical factors. An ultrasound is a sound wave machine that uses a computer to make&#xD;
      pictures of the tissues of the body. A CT is an x-ray machine that uses a computer to make&#xD;
      pictures of the organs of the body. An MRI is a scan which uses a magnetic machine to make&#xD;
      pictures of the inside of the body. A PET scan is an x-ray technique that uses a sugar&#xD;
      solution that you drink to see activity inside the body. The PET and CT scans will look at&#xD;
      where the LCH is in the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If tests show that the patient can participate in this study and they choose to participate,&#xD;
      treatment will begin based on randomization to either the cytarabine (&quot;experimental&quot;) arm or&#xD;
      the vinblastine/prednisone (&quot;standard&quot;) arm as described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will have a history and physical and blood tests before each cycle. The cancer drugs&#xD;
      will be given to the patient intravenously (IV). An IV is a tube placed inside a vein to give&#xD;
      medicine to the patient. If at anytime during the study the cancer gets worse, the patient&#xD;
      will be taken off the study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Cytarabine (&quot;experimental&quot;) arm&#xD;
&#xD;
           Initial therapy I (Weeks 1-6)&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Cytarabine for five consecutive days. This five-day cycle will be repeated every 21&#xD;
           days for a total of two cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patient will have scans to see how the LCH responded to the treatment during week 6. If&#xD;
           the patient had LCH in their bone marrow (BM) at the beginning of the study, they will&#xD;
           have another BM biopsy. If the cancer is stable and does not respond to therapy by Week&#xD;
           6, the patient will be taken off the study treatment. If the disease is only partly gone&#xD;
           or unchanged the patient will receive additional therapy with Initial therapy II.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Initial therapy II (Weeks 7-12)&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Cytarabine for five consecutive days. This five-day cycle will be repeated every 21&#xD;
           days for a total of two cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patient will have scans to see how the LCH responded to the treatment during week 12&#xD;
           (unless they had no active disease at week 6). If the patient had LCH in their bone&#xD;
           marrow (BM) at the beginning of the study, they will have another BM biopsy. If the&#xD;
           cancer is stable and does not respond to therapy by Week 12, the patient will be taken&#xD;
           off the study treatment. If the patient has no evidence of active disease at this time&#xD;
           they will proceed to Continuation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Continuation therapy (Weeks 13-52)&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Cytarabine for five consecutive days. This five-day cycle will be repeated every 28&#xD;
           days for 10 additional cycles to complete one year of therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patient will have scans to see how the LCH responded to the treatment at Week 24 and at&#xD;
           the end of therapy. If the patient had LCH in their bone marrow (BM) at the beginning of&#xD;
           the study, they will have another BM biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Vinblastine/prednisone (&quot;standard&quot;) arm&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial therapy I (Weeks 1-6)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prednisone given by mouth two times a day daily on days 1-28 AND&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vinblastine will be given IV (into a vein) one day a week for 6 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will have scans to see how the LCH responded to the treatment after week 6. If the&#xD;
      patient had LCH in their bone marrow (BM) at the beginning of the study, they will have&#xD;
      another BM biopsy. If the disease is completely gone by Week 6, patient will proceed to&#xD;
      Continuation therapy. If the disease is only partly gone or unchanged patient will receive&#xD;
      additional therapy with Initial therapy II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will have scans to see how the LCH responded to the treatment during Week 12 and if&#xD;
      they had LCH in their bone marrow (BM) at the beginning of the study, they will have another&#xD;
      BM biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial therapy II (Weeks 7-12, given only if the patient does not have evidence of active&#xD;
      disease by Week 6)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prednisone by mouth on the first three days of each week during weeks 7-12 AND&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vinblastine IV weekly during weeks 7-12&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the disease is gone or better after this additional therapy Continuation therapy will&#xD;
      begin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuation therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prednisone by mouth twice daily day on days 1-5 every 3 weeks AND&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vinblastine IV once every 3 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6-Mercaptopurine by mouth daily NOTE: Only high risk patients will receive&#xD;
           6-Mercaptopurine&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will have scans to see how the LCH responded to the treatment at Week 24 and at the&#xD;
      end of therapy. If the patient had LCH in their bone marrow (BM) at the beginning of the&#xD;
      study, they will have another BM biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY FOLLOW-UP: Patient will be in this study for 5 years after completion of their therapy.&#xD;
      The doctors will exam the patient at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, then&#xD;
      at 18 and 24 months, then yearly until 5 years after the patient is taken off treatment. At&#xD;
      these visits the patient may have routine blood tests, scans, and the biology tests.&#xD;
