  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to obtain ovarian tissue from female participants who will&#xD;
      receive therapy which is expected to result in a loss or impairment of ovarian function&#xD;
      and/or infertility and wish to preserve (freeze) ovarian tissue for the purpose of initiating&#xD;
      a pregnancy in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Removal of the ovary for cryopreservation is an investigational procedure. 100% of the tissue&#xD;
      will be used for the participant's future use. There have been 86 pregnancies as a result of&#xD;
      frozen ovarian tissue that has been re-implanted back into the pelvis and hormonal function&#xD;
      has been restored in individuals for up to 7 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By doing this study, the investigators hope to learn of how to successfully freeze and thaw&#xD;
      ovarian tissue in a manner that permits subsequent use by patients at some point in the&#xD;
      future. Participation may also advance our knowledge of how to successfully mature follicles&#xD;
      and oocytes (eggs) that are contained in these tissues which may help others in the future.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research procedures will be conducted at the University of Kentucky (UK) Medical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the study will provide ovarian tissue cryopreservation for their own personal&#xD;
      use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the study will be until the participant reaches age 41 years. Participants&#xD;
      will be broken out into four categories:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have surgical removal of their ovarian tissue using the methods determined&#xD;
      by their surgeon based on their medical/surgical diagnosis or treatment. Participants in one&#xD;
      of the following categories will participant in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Participants have elected to have one or both ovaries removed for the treatment or&#xD;
           prevention of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Participants who have elected to have surgery to remove all or part of one or both&#xD;
           ovaries for medical reasons where cryopreservation of the remaining limited portions of&#xD;
           normal ovarian cortex is the only option for fertility preservation at the time (except&#xD;
           that ovarian cortex from the ovary that contains the mass will not be cryopreserved).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Participants who have elected to have surgery to remove all or part of one or both&#xD;
           ovaries for medical reasons where cryopreservation of the remaining limited portions of&#xD;
           normal ovarian cortex is the only option for fertility preservation at the time but who&#xD;
           cannot or will not provide tissue to the research pool (except that ovarian cortex for&#xD;
           the ovary that contains the mass will not be cryopreserved).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Participants who have elected to have one or part of one ovary removed, solely for the&#xD;
           purpose of fertility preservation because they are not candidates for or choose not to&#xD;
           use more mature fertility preservation technologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergoing elective removal of an ovary (category C above) will undergo a&#xD;
      procedure called laparoscopy to remove the ovary. This surgery will be performed under&#xD;
      general anesthesia and one ovary will be removed in total through an instrument channel&#xD;
      employing standard techniques of operative laparoscopy. This surgical procedure is performed&#xD;
      solely for fertility preservation but will potentially be coordinated with another procedure&#xD;
      such as placement of a central line for future chemotherapy or laparotomy for another&#xD;
      purpose. Although only one ovary will be removed, both of the participant's ovaries must&#xD;
      appear normal for the procedure to be completed. The ovary to be removed will be chosen at&#xD;
      the time of surgery based on appearance and ease of removal. After the surgery is complete,&#xD;
      the participant will not have any further procedures except for a routine post-operative&#xD;
      visit. A 0.5 cm cross section from the short axis of the ovary will be provided to the&#xD;
      Department of Pathology for routine histological evaluation, and the remaining tissue will be&#xD;
      processed for cryopreservation. If pathology finds evidence of cancer in the ovarian tissue&#xD;
      provided at surgery, they may request that all of the participant's tissue (even tissue that&#xD;
      has been frozen for their use) be returned to pathology for a more detailed examination. In&#xD;
      this case, no tissue is available for the participant to use for fertility preservation&#xD;
      purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      b. Cryopreservation: Ovarian tissue will be cryopreserved under the protocol originally&#xD;
      established by the National Physicians Cooperative of the Oncofertility Consortium. The&#xD;
      ovarian tissue will be removed at a UK or Norton Healthcare facility and evaluated for gross&#xD;
      disease by a pathologist, embryologist, andrologist or a reproductive endocrinology and&#xD;
      infertility (REI) physician. The ovarian cortex will be dissected from the medulla and cut&#xD;
      into strips in culture/holding media, washed to remove blood cells, and cryopreserved.&#xD;
      Cryopreservation will be performed using modifications of the techniques described by Gosden&#xD;
      et al. (1994) or will be vitrified using a modification of the techniques of Kuwayama et al.,&#xD;
      2007. The procedure for cryopreservation/vitrification may be modified as improvements become&#xD;
      available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The designated laboratory directors at UK responsible for the overall quality of the ovarian&#xD;
      tissue cryopreservation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      c. Tissue storage: Cryopreserved participant tissues will be transferred to Reprotech, Ltd&#xD;
      (RTL) in Roseville, Minnesota for storage and subsequent release. Reprotech, Ltd. is an FDA&#xD;
      compliant and American Association of Tissue Banks accredited long term storage facility for&#xD;
      reproductive tissues. Based on the extended periods of time that these tissues are likely to&#xD;
      be stored Reprotech, Ltd. provides maximum flexibility for the participants involved. In this&#xD;
      way, the participant can store tissues as long as they wish and ship them to a fertility&#xD;
      treatment center of their choice at the time of use. The participant can determine how her&#xD;
      own tissue will be used as technology changes and based on her unique circumstances.&#xD;
      Reprotech, Ltd. does not perform fertility treatments and is not affiliated with any&#xD;
      fertility center so there is no potential conflict of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      d. Infectious Disease Screening and Testing: Banking and subsequent use of ovarian tissue is&#xD;
      regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In order to comply with current tissue&#xD;
      banking regulations and to be prepared for any future changes in regulations while these&#xD;
      ovarian tissues are in storage, participants will be tested and screened for a number of&#xD;
      infectious diseases prior to banking ovarian tissue.The testing will include but not be&#xD;
      limited to testing for Hepatitis B and C and HIV. The testing that will be performed will be&#xD;
      testing that is mandated for donors of leukocyte rich tissues and must be performed within 7&#xD;
      days of tissue procurement. In this way, the tissue could potentially be used by the&#xD;
      participant herself and it could also be suitable for use in another individual (such as a&#xD;
      surrogate) in the future if indicated by the participant's medical diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the ovarian tissue was vaginally removed during surgery the sites will also collect a&#xD;
      vaginal swab from the participant for Gonorrhea and Chlamydia testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Please note that if the HIV screening test is positive, a confirmatory test will then be&#xD;
      performed. Should the screening tests detect that participants are infected with HIV this&#xD;
      information will be communicated confidentially to them through personal contact by a&#xD;
      qualified professional. Participants will meet with a qualified professional who will provide&#xD;
      HIV counseling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are risks associated with this study and those risks are outlined in the study informed&#xD;
      consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefit vs. Risk: There is no guarantee that participants will get any benefit from taking&#xD;
      part in this study, although 86 babies have been born from transplanted frozen ovarian&#xD;
      tissue. A females participation may provide her with a means to restore her fertility and&#xD;
      reproductive hormonal function in the future as observed in previous reports. A females&#xD;
      participation may also advance the investigator's understanding of how to successfully freeze&#xD;
      and thaw ovarian tissue in a manner that permits subsequent use by the participant and other&#xD;
      patients at some point in the future. A females participation may also advance the&#xD;
      investigator's knowledge of how to successfully mature follicles and oocytes (eggs) that are&#xD;
      contained in these tissues which may help the participant or others in the future. However,&#xD;
      there is a significant possibility that there may be no direct benefit to the participant&#xD;
      from her participation in this research study. Specifically, there is the possibility that&#xD;
      ovarian cryopreservation will not result in successful pregnancy in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are alternatives to taking part in this study and those alternatives are addressed in&#xD;
      the study informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Costs: All expenses related to the research procedure will be covered by the research funds&#xD;
      and include the oophorectomy, anesthesia, pathologist's fees and infectious disease testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Either the participant or their insurance company, Medicare or Medicaid will be responsible&#xD;
      for the costs of all care and treatment that the participant would receive during this study&#xD;
      that she would normally receive for her condition. These are costs that are considered&#xD;
      medically reasonable and necessary and will be part of the care she receives if she does not&#xD;
      take part in this study. This includes the confirmatory HIV testing and the follicle&#xD;
      stimulating hormone (FSH) testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are also costs associated with the handling, processing, shipping and storage of&#xD;
      ovarian tissue. Those costs are outlined in the study informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the unlikely event that the participant is hurt or injured while participating in this&#xD;
      study the medical costs related to their care and treatment will be their responsibility or&#xD;
      submitted to their insurance.&#xD;
