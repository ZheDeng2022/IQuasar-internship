    <textblock>
      The general objective of the study is to compare the efficacy of administering midazolam&#xD;
      orally as syrup versus nasally with nasal atomizer. The specific objectives are to measure:&#xD;
      1) acceptability of the medication, 2) effect on behavior, 3) time of onset, 4) maximum&#xD;
      working time.&#xD;

      -  Prospective, cross over design&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study and control group: 100 healthy children (ASA 1), ages: 2-6 years, uncooperative&#xD;
           (Frankl 1-210), that needs at least two similar dental treatments. Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
           enlarged tonsils (Brodsky's grading scale11 +3 = 50-75% airway obstruction, and +4 =&#xD;
           &gt;75% airway obstruction), upper respiratory tract infection or nasal discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomization: At the first appointment the subjects will assigned randomly to receive&#xD;
           oral midazolam or nasal midazolam; at the second appointment the other regimen will be&#xD;
           administered. In this way the study group is also the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sedation: oral midazolam dose is 0.5mg/kg. Nasal midazolam dose is 0.2mg/kg. During&#xD;
           treatment 50% nitrous oxide/ 50% oxygen will be administered via nasal hood. Pulse rate&#xD;
           and hemoglobin oxygen saturation will be continuously monitored using a pulse oximeter&#xD;
           placed on the patient's finger and recorded every 5 min.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acceptability of the medication: compliance in taking the medication will be assessed&#xD;
           and recorded as: willingly, coaxed, forced, or failed (not administered).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Behavior during dental treatment: Houpt scale measures behavior by rating sleep,&#xD;
           movement, crying and overall behavior. The degree of alertness, movement and crying will&#xD;
           be assessed before, during (every 5 min) and after the operative procedure. The rating&#xD;
           will be done by one observer blind to the route of administration. This blind observer&#xD;
           will also monitor the pulse and oxygen saturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time of onset: recording the time from the moment of midazolam administration until the&#xD;
           patient is drowsy, composed, calm, and minor resistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maximum working time: recording duration of the dental treatment.&#xD;
