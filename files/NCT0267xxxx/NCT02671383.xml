  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a switch study to assess the non-inferiority (in terms of efficacy and safety) of&#xD;
      darunavir (boosted with ritonavir, DRV/r 400mg/100mg daily) when compared with lopinavir&#xD;
      (boosted with ritonavir, LPV/r total dose 800mg/200mg daily), in combination with a&#xD;
      nucleoside backbone, administered as a second line therapy in HIV positive individuals.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label randomised, parallel group, phase 3b, switch study to demonstrate&#xD;
      non-inferiority of low-dose boosted darunavir (DRV/RTV 400/100 mg once daily) compared with&#xD;
      boosted lopinavir-based (LPV/RTV 800/200 mg daily) second-line regimens when administered&#xD;
      over 48 weeks in combination with two nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors in&#xD;
      patients infected with HIV-1 who are virologically suppressed and stable on a standard&#xD;
      second-line regimen. All medications will be provided in an open-label design. Patients who&#xD;
      are virologically suppressed and stable on a standard second-line regimen will be recruited&#xD;
      for the study. There are concerns that switching these patients may result in virological&#xD;
      failure as the study aimed at demonstrating non-inferiority of darunavir compared with&#xD;
      Lopinavir. In such cases, the investigator will ensure that virological failures are&#xD;
      investigated and patients are switched back to standard of care immediately. Participants&#xD;
      will be patients who are receiving HIV treatment in public clinics. Interested patients will&#xD;
      be invited to the study, information given, and only those who will give written informed&#xD;
      consent will be screened, and if eligible enrolled into the study. Each enrolled participant&#xD;
      will be follow-up at week 4, 12, 24, 36, and 48 (exit visit) from enrolment date. Data will&#xD;
      be collected using ethics-approved worksheets, and captured into REDCap. The data manager&#xD;
      will ensure data are correct and complete by performing data verifications - physical and&#xD;
      electronic. Internal quality control will be performed by dedicated staff based on the study&#xD;
      quality plan to be implemented. The external study monitor will perform 100% eligibility&#xD;
      checks on all signed informed consents in addition to other source verifications during her&#xD;
      periodic site visits according to the monitoring plan to be implemented. Findings from the&#xD;
      monitor will be implemented in the form of data/procedure corrections per good clinical&#xD;
      practice, and all relevant staff trained and documented accordingly. Participants' records&#xD;
      will be coded and stored in a lockable cabinet. Only study staff will have access to&#xD;
      participants' records. All electronic documents relating to the study will be stored in&#xD;
      password-protected computers and only accessible to study staff. Study staff are not allowed&#xD;
      to share password among themselves or with anyone outside the study team. Designed in&#xD;
      non-inferiority fashion, this study will enrol approximately 300 participants for 80% power&#xD;
      to detect a 10% non-inferiority margin in the per protocol (PP) analysis. A Data Safety&#xD;
      Management Board (DSMB) will oversee and review the interim data report. At the close of the&#xD;
      study, results will be disseminated to participants, and the scientific community, as well as&#xD;
      updated on clinicaltrial.gov.&#xD;
