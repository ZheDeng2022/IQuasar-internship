      Hyperkalemia is a common problem in the emergency services and one of the life threatening&#xD;
      metabolic emergencies. Calcium, insulin, beta adrenoceptor agonists, bicarbonate, diuretics,&#xD;
      sodium polystyrene sulfonate and lastly dialysis are advised in treatment. Especially,&#xD;
      avoiding evolution of serious arrythmias and iv calcium using in the treatment of occured&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities, there is not sufficient level of survey in the&#xD;
      literature. So the aim of this study was to evaluate administration of iv calcium efficiency&#xD;
      on vital signs and ECG.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Hyperkalemia is a common problem in the emergency services and one of the life threatening&#xD;
      metabolic emergencies. Serious hyperkalemia is mostly seen in patients who have known chronic&#xD;
      renal failure or end stage renal disease, and also new diagnosis of acute renal failure can&#xD;
      be appear with serious hyperkalemia. Paresthesia and weakness which is proceeded to flask&#xD;
      paralysis can be observable, sharp ''T'' waves (the repolarization and relaxation of the&#xD;
      ventricles), diminution of ''P'' waves (atrial depolarisation and contraction), long ''PR''&#xD;
      intervals (time frame from the beginning of atrial depolarization to the beginning of&#xD;
      ventricular depolarization), or elongated ''QRS'' complexes (depolarisation and contraction&#xD;
      of the ventricles), ''ST'' segment (end of the QRS complex to the beginning of the T wave)&#xD;
      elevation, and serious ventricular arrythmias can be seen in electrocardiography. Calcium,&#xD;
      insulin, beta adrenoceptor agonists, bicarbonate, diuretics, sodium polystyrene sulfonate and&#xD;
      lastly dialysis are advised in treatment. Especially, avoiding evolution of serious&#xD;
      arrythmias and İv calcium using in the treatment of occured ''ECG'' abnormalities, there is&#xD;
      not sufficient level of survey in the literature. The group of Cochrane stated in systematic&#xD;
      assessment report, which is published in 2005 about IV calcium administration, available&#xD;
      dates are based on anecdotal and animal experiments. And in the researches that we have done,&#xD;
      we did not find clinical human studies showing the benefits of calcium administration beyond&#xD;
      the delivery of case reports . The aim of this study was to evaluate administration of İv&#xD;
      calcium efficiency on vital signs and ECG.&#xD;
