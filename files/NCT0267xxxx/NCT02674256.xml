      Introduction and aim&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stress is well known to affect visceral sensitivity in Human. The investigators speculate&#xD;
      that visceral hypersensitivity plays an important role in symptom perception in&#xD;
      gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD). The role of acute stress mimicked by corticotrophin&#xD;
      releasing hormone (CRH) administration on esophageal sensitivity has not been studied. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that stress mediated through CRH-release increases esophageal&#xD;
      sensitivity. A first step in the investigation of this hypothesis is to study whether&#xD;
      administration of CRH has an influence on esophageal sensitivity in healthy volunteers (HV).&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the effect of CRH-administration on&#xD;
      esophageal sensitivity in a group of HV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be performed in cross-over on 15 HV with no prior history of digestive&#xD;
      disease. Esophageal sensitivity will be tested by multimodal stimulation on two sessions&#xD;
      (placebo and CRH-administration), with an interval at least of one week. The two sessions&#xD;
      will be scheduled by randomization for every subject. After blinded administration of CRH&#xD;
      100Âµg or placebo IV, esophageal sensitivity will be assessed using a multimodal esophageal&#xD;
      stimulation probe which allows thermal, mechanical, electrical and chemical stimulations of&#xD;
      the esophagus. Esophageal sensitivity will be assessed using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), the&#xD;
      mood with specific questionnaires (Manikin Self assessment SAM, Profile of Mood Schedule&#xD;
      (POMS, State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)) and the cortisol with salivary samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Esophageal sensitivity for the different stimuli (heat, mechanical, electrical and chemical)&#xD;
      will be compared between CRH and placebo conditions. To determine the stress-inducing&#xD;
      capability of CRH-administration, the POMS questionnaire, STAI, Manikin self assessment and&#xD;
      cortisol levels after the stress-protocol will be compared with the basal measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      If CRH-administration increases esophageal sensitivity, a stress model could be applied to&#xD;
      investigate the influence of a real life stressor on esophageal sensitivity in healthy&#xD;
      subjects. In a third part, a mast-cell stabilizing drug could be tested after administration&#xD;
      of a stressor in order to investigate its role on esophageal sensitivity. In the future, this&#xD;
      might be proposed to refractory GERD in a controlled randomized trial.&#xD;

      1. INTRODUCTION Gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) is the presence of symptoms&#xD;
           (heartburn, regurgitation) or lesions that can be attributed to the reflux of gastric&#xD;
           contents into the esophagus. In humans, pain is a multimodal experience composted of&#xD;
           sensory, physiological and psychological aspects. In order to mimic the clinical&#xD;
           situation, experimental models should be based on multimodal testing regimens in which&#xD;
           different receptors and central nervous system mechanisms are activated. Typical and&#xD;
           atypical symptoms may not only arise from acid reflux, but also from reflux with less&#xD;
           acidic pH (pH 4-7). In GERD patients with persisting symptoms on proton pump inhibitor&#xD;
           (PPI) therapy, ongoing weakly acidic reflux is well established as an important&#xD;
           underlying factor. The basis for symptom generation during weakly acidic reflux remains&#xD;
           to be determined, but acid sensitivity in the pH range 4-7, mechanical distension,&#xD;
           sensitivity to other chemical factors and esophageal hypersensitivity to physiological&#xD;
           levels of reflux have been proposed. The investigators speculate that visceral&#xD;
           hypersensitivity plays an important role in symptom perception. This is suggested by the&#xD;
           reflux parameters that are usual within the physiological number during PPI therapy.&#xD;
           Also, the investigators previously demonstrated that refractory GERD patients have&#xD;
           increased visceral hypersensitivity for thermal, chemical and mechanical esophageal&#xD;
           stimulation compared to HV.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Stress is well known to affect visceral sensitivity in humans. A majority of patients&#xD;
           with GERD report stress as an important factor triggering symptom exacerbation. A&#xD;
           real-life stressor could exacerbate heartburn in GERD patients by enhancing perceptual&#xD;
           response to esophageal acid exposure. The interaction between psychological state and GI&#xD;
           function is a complex and developing field. The brain-gut axis, mediating the effects of&#xD;
           stress on the Gastrointestinal (GI) tract, has been considered a pivotal player in the&#xD;
           pathogenesis of functional GI disorders like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and&#xD;
           functional dyspepsia (FD). A possible mechanism of stress-induced visceral sensitivity&#xD;
           could be the barrier dysfunction. A study performed in humans, showed that an acute&#xD;
           psychological stressor induces hyperpermeability in a mast cell dependent fashion and&#xD;
           exogenous peripheral CRH recapitulated its effects on barrier function. This increase in&#xD;
           intestinal permeability is a phenomenon which appears as a prerequisite for visceral&#xD;
           hypersensitivity. The acute role of CRH on esophageal sensitivity has not been studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. OBJECTIVE Stress increases permeability via CRH-mediated mast cell activation. The&#xD;
           investigators hypothesize that stress mediated through CRH-release increases esophageal&#xD;
           sensitivity. Therefore, the aim of our study is to investigate the effect of&#xD;
           CRH-administration on esophageal sensitivity in a group of HV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. GENERAL DESCRIPTION Studies will be performed in HV. All participants will receive and&#xD;
           sign a copy of the informed consent before initiation of the study. Esophageal&#xD;
           sensitivity will be tested by multimodal stimulation on two sessions (placebo and&#xD;
           CRH-administration).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. MATERIALS AND METHODS Studies will be performed using a multimodal esophageal&#xD;
           stimulation probe which allows esophageal thermal, mechanical, electrical and chemical&#xD;
           stimulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
           During each stimulation, HV will record symptom perception using VAS. First perception&#xD;
           (VAS=1), pain perception threshold (VAS=5) and pain tolerance threshold (VAS=7) will be&#xD;
           recorded. All stimulations will be immediately terminated when the VAS 7 is reached. At&#xD;
           the time of VAS 7, subjects will be asked to draw the referred pain area, to identify&#xD;
           pain location.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Thermal stimulation will be performed by re-circulating a saline solution, heated by a&#xD;
           water bath, through the balloon mounted on the probe. Stimulation temperature will be&#xD;
           steadily increased by increasing the flow rate from the water bath to the balloon. The&#xD;
           volume in the balloon will be kept constant (5ml) to avoid mechanical stimulation. A&#xD;
           temperature sensor in the balloon will continuously monitor the stimulation temperature,&#xD;
           which is displayed online on a computer throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Mechanical stimulation will be performed by distension of the balloon. The flow of&#xD;
           saline into the balloon, inducing the distension, is regulated by a computer controlled&#xD;
           pump. The volume in the balloon is displayed on the computer screen throughout the&#xD;
           stimulation. Mechanical stimulations will be performed with water of 37 degrees Celsius,&#xD;
           to avoid thermal stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Electrical stimulation will be performed by 2 electrodes mounted on the probe. Single&#xD;
           burst pulses will be given with duration of 1ms at 200Hz. The amplitude of the pulses&#xD;
           will increase with steps of 0.5mA. The maximum intensity is limited to 50 mA, as&#xD;
           previous studies have shown atrial capturing with higher intensities. Electrocardiogram&#xD;
           (ECG) monitoring will be performed as a safety measure during the electrical&#xD;
           stimulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Chemical stimulation will be performed by infusing an acidic solution (HCl 0.1N) in the&#xD;
           distal esophagus, with a flow rate of 2ml/min. The stimulation will last for a maximum&#xD;
           of 30 min.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After an overnight fast subjects will come to the endoscopy unit of the Universitary&#xD;
           Hospital of Leuven,Gasthuisberg, where the study will be performed. Two sessions will be&#xD;
           scheduled for every subject: one placebo and one CRH session, with one week interval at&#xD;
           least between each of them. Sessions will run in a single-blind way, as far as the&#xD;
           placebo or drugs are concerned. The order of placebo and CRH-administration will be&#xD;
           randomized by drawing cards from a box of cards determining the sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
           At the beginning of the session, the multimodal stimulation probe will be positioned&#xD;
           through the mouth. After the probe is positioned in the esophagus, it will be fixed to&#xD;
           the chin and the subject will remain in semi-recumbent position for the entire study.&#xD;
           Before the actual stimulations start, there will be an adaptation period of 15 min, to&#xD;
           get used to the feeling of the probe and to provide instructions for the correct use of&#xD;
           the VAS meter. Fifteen minutes after the ingestion of the multimodal esophageal&#xD;
           stimulation probe, 100Âµg CRH powder for injection (CRH ferringÂ®, Ferring, Aalst,&#xD;
           Belgium) and 1mL of NaCl 0.9% will be put together, then the solution will be injected&#xD;
           intravenously over the course of 1 minute. With this dose, side-effects are limited to&#xD;
           transient facial flushing that lasts from 5 to 45 min in 75% of patients. During placebo&#xD;
           sessions, 1mL of NaCl 0.9% will be put in an identical syringe as the one used for CRH&#xD;
           administration, and then injected intravenously (IV). In this way the HV will be blinded&#xD;
           for the administration of CRH or placebo. Over time, each HV will receive placebo or CRH&#xD;
           in the first session in a random sequence. In the second session, the subject will&#xD;
           receive the other product that he/she didn't receive the first time.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Salivary samples will be obtained at each session to determine salivary cortisol&#xD;
           immediately before placebo or CRH-administration, at 30, 60, 90 and 120 min after&#xD;
           administration. Salivary cortisol will be determined by ELISA. On every session, an&#xD;
           assessment of general mood will be performed by the POMS and the STAI state&#xD;
           questionnaires before and after the stimulation tests. The POMS consists of words&#xD;
           describing different feelings and emotions at the present moment. The STAI state is&#xD;
           validated, and widely used measuring transitory anxiety states.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. DATA ANALYSIS The main objective is to show a difference for thermal stimulation with or&#xD;
           without injection of CRH. The number of HV to be included is calculated with a medium&#xD;
           comparison test. For a first species of risk Î± of 5% and a unilateral formulation, the&#xD;
           investigators need to include 15 HV in total in order to highlight the expected&#xD;
           differences and ensure a power of 80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Temperature, volume, cross-section area of the balloon, pressure and electrical current&#xD;
           will be measured at first perception, pain perception threshold and pain tolerance&#xD;
           threshold and will be used to determine esophageal sensitivity. Esophageal sensitivity&#xD;
           for the different stimuli (heat, mechanical, electrical and chemical) will be compared&#xD;
           between CRH and placebo conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To determine the stress-inducing capability of CRH-administration, the POMS, STAI and&#xD;
           cortisol levels after the stress-protocol will be compared with the basal measurements&#xD;
           of the first study day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. PERSPECTIVES If CRH-administration increases esophageal sensitivity, a stress model&#xD;
           could be applied to investigate the influence of a real life stressor on esophageal&#xD;
           sensitivity in HV. In a third part, a mast-cell stabilizing drug could be tested after&#xD;
           administration of a stressor in order to investigate its role on esophageal sensitivity.&#xD;
           In the future, this might be proposed to refractory GERD in a controlled randomized&#xD;
           trial.&#xD;
