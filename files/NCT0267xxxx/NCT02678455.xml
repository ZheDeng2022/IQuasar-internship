    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the recombinant&#xD;
      live attenuated tetravalent dengue virus vaccine admixture TV005 (TetraVax-DV T005) in&#xD;
      healthy adults, adolescents, and children in Dhaka, Bangladesh.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dengue viruses (DENV) are the leading arboviral infection globally, with over 2 billion&#xD;
      people at risk of infection worldwide. The first dengue fever outbreak in Bangladesh occurred&#xD;
      in 2000, and since then, dengue fever has had a continued presence throughout Bangladesh.&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the recombinant live attenuated&#xD;
      tetravalent dengue virus vaccine admixture TV005 (TetraVax-DV T005) in healthy adults,&#xD;
      adolescents, and children in Dhaka, Bangladesh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll four cohorts of participants: adults, adolescents, children, and young&#xD;
      children. Study researchers will evaluate study data for each cohort before enrolling the&#xD;
      subsequent cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either TV005 vaccine or placebo at study&#xD;
      entry (Day 0). Additional study visits will occur on Days 7, 14, 28, 56, 180, 360, 720, and&#xD;
      1080. Study visits will include blood collection, physical examinations, and clinical&#xD;
      assessments. Participants will record and monitor their temperature and symptoms until Day&#xD;
      14. Study staff will contact participants daily until Day 14; after Day 14, study staff will&#xD;
      contact participants weekly (and after Day 180, monthly) throughout the study for follow-up&#xD;
      health monitoring.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy males or females (non-pregnant or lactating) between the ages of 12 months and&#xD;
             50 years at the time of enrollment into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Reside in Mirpur Wards 2, 3, or 5 (or other Wards within Mirpur as designated by the&#xD;
             PI if needed to reach enrollment targets) at the time of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Study participants and/or their parents/guardians/legally acceptable or authorized&#xD;
             representatives (LARs) who the Investigator believes can and will comply with the&#xD;
             requirements of the protocol (e.g., return for follow-up visits).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Good general health as determined by physical examination, laboratory screening, and&#xD;
             review of medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If the participant is greater than or equal to 18 years of age, an informed consent&#xD;
             form signed and dated by the study participant (and by an independent witness if&#xD;
             required by local regulations). If the study participant is a minor, an assent form&#xD;
             (for participants age 11-17 years) and informed consent form signed and dated by the&#xD;
             participant's properly identified parent(s) or legally acceptable representative. If a&#xD;
             participant is less than 11 years of age, the participant's parent(s) or legally&#xD;
             acceptable representative will consent by signing the consent form for minor&#xD;
             participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If the participant is female, she must not be pregnant or planning to become pregnant&#xD;
             up to 28 days post vaccination. Female participants under the age of 18 will be&#xD;
             enrolled, if they have not yet reached menarche. Females 18 years of age or older,&#xD;
             must be properly using a method of pregnancy prevention that is known to be highly&#xD;
             effective per the PI. Reliable methods of contraception include: hormonal birth&#xD;
             control, condoms with spermicide, diaphragm with spermicide, surgical sterilization,&#xD;
             intrauterine device, and abstinence (greater than or equal to 6 months since last&#xD;
             sexual encounter). For female study participants who are 18 years of age or older&#xD;
             pregnancy testing will occur at screening and again before vaccination and they must&#xD;
             have a negative pregnancy test prior to vaccination. Additionally, they will receive&#xD;
             counselling on the importance of effective contraception during the 30 days prior to&#xD;
             vaccination and continuing up to Day 28. Counselling will occur at their screening&#xD;
             visit, on all clinic visit days up to Day 28. Female participants 18 years of age and&#xD;
             older will be subject to pregnancy testing on the Study Day 28 and 56 visits. If&#xD;
             female participants under the age of 18 that have not yet reached menarche prior to&#xD;
             enrollment, reach menarche during the study, they will continue to be enrolled and&#xD;
             followed-up through the entire three year follow-up period.&#xD;
