  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) refers to any breast cancer that does not express&#xD;
      estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) or Her2/neu. Its incidence is&#xD;
      approximately 180,000 cases per year. TNBC are known to be more aggressive with poor&#xD;
      prognosis specially when no pathologic complete response (pCR) is achieved after neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy, with a higher risk of recurrence and a poor survival once that recurrence&#xD;
      occurs. On the other hand, there is not a specific adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment for&#xD;
      these patients. Since autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) allows the&#xD;
      usage of higher doses of chemotherapy, which results in higher cellular destruction with a&#xD;
      decrease of hematological toxicity, it is proposed that this procedure is able to improve&#xD;
      prognosis in TNBC patients with no pathologic complete response after neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for approximately 15%-25% of all breast cancer&#xD;
      cases. TNBC are usually high-grade tumors, presented among younger women, African American&#xD;
      and Hispanic women have a higher risk; generally in advanced stages when diagnosed, with&#xD;
      visceral recurrence (liver, lung, brain). Standard treatment is surgery with adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy and radiotherapy. As a variation, neoadjuvant chemotherapy is very frequently&#xD;
      used for triple-negative breast cancers, however, there is a lack of specific agents for this&#xD;
      subset of patients, and, pathologic complete response does correlate with overall survival.&#xD;
      At the moment, no optimal chemotherapy exists for TNBC patients who do not achieve a pCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the German group, in the triple negative subset, 31% of patients with&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy achieved pathologic complete response (pCR), which correlates with&#xD;
      progression free survival (HR 6.02 for those who do not achieve pCR), and an overall survival&#xD;
      (HR 12.41 for those who do not achieve pCR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The usage of high-dose chemotherapy with autologous HSCT, is one of the therapies that have&#xD;
      been studied in the patients with localized breast cancer aiming to improve its outcome.&#xD;
      Autologous HSCT allows higher chemotherapy doses, which results in higher tumor cells&#xD;
      destruction. Since 1980, several phase II studies were performed with high-dose chemotherapy&#xD;
      and autologous HSCT, with an apparently initial benefit, thus this strategy was widely used&#xD;
      outside controlled clinical trials. Afterward, the randomized studies did not show benefit in&#xD;
      overall survival, causing this strategy to be abandoned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to highlight studies heterogeneity by means of different treatment options in&#xD;
      both experimental and control group, besides, advances in autologous HSCT has significantly&#xD;
      reduced the complexity, mobility, and mortality related to the chemotherapy treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two published studies including patients with localized TNBC, showed benefit in the&#xD;
      progression free survival in the high-dose chemotherapy group, with a tendency to improved&#xD;
      overall survival. One of them was performed by a german group, including patients with at&#xD;
      least 9 positive nodes, which were randomized to receive two cycles of conventional dose&#xD;
      chemotherapy followed by two cycles of high-dose chemotherapy with autologous HSCT versus&#xD;
      four cycles of conventional dose chemotherapy followed by three cycles of dense dose&#xD;
      chemotherapy, with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) administration. Progression&#xD;
      free survival was 76 months in the group of high dose chemotherapy versus 40.6 months in the&#xD;
      conventional chemotherapy group, with an overall survival of 60 versus 44%, being&#xD;
      statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that patients with TNBC with a high risk of recurrence (no pCR) who undergo&#xD;
      high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous HSCT will have a higher overall survival&#xD;
      compared to those who do not undergo the above mentioned treatment.&#xD;
