      The investigators hypothesize that there is a difference in plantar tissue thickness, plantar&#xD;
      pressure, and pain score in patients diagnosed with plantar fat pad atrophy compared to&#xD;
      healthy, foot-type matched controls. Results will be measured objectively using ultrasound&#xD;
      for tissue thickness, optical pedobarograph for plantar pressure, and Manchester foot pain&#xD;
      and disability index (MFPDI) for pain score. Furthermore, investigators predict that these&#xD;
      results will help establish criteria for fad pad atrophy diagnosis in the clinic as well as&#xD;
      determine which patients would receive greatest benefit from fat grafting to the foot.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Human feet must bear the entire weight of the body. Feet have fat pads on their plantar&#xD;
      surface that act as shock absorbers between the skin and bone. However, repetitive mechanical&#xD;
      stress throughout a person's lifetime leads to gradual atrophy of these fat pads. In addition&#xD;
      to this age-related degeneration, fat pad atrophy can be caused by other mechanisms such as&#xD;
      abnormal foot mechanics, steroid use, and collagen vascular disease. Regardless of the cause,&#xD;
      many patients with plantar fat pad atrophy experience considerable pain and loss of function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have negatively correlated plantar soft tissue thickness with plantar&#xD;
      pressure, with the loss of plantar fat being a fundamental mechanism associated with&#xD;
      pressure-related foot disorders. Increased pressure from fat pad atrophy is commonly managed&#xD;
      with padded socks, insoles, and shoe modification. However, these extrinsic strategies are&#xD;
      totally dependent on patient compliance, and devices must be replaced as soon as they begin&#xD;
      to break down. Another treatment option includes silicone injections into the plantar aspect&#xD;
      of the foot. In one study, patients receiving silicone treatment experienced increased&#xD;
      plantar tissue thickness and decreased plantar pressure, but these cushioning properties&#xD;
      decreased over time and the need for additional booster injections was ultimately suggested.&#xD;
      Furthermore, silicone has been known to migrate away from the injection site and has been&#xD;
      found in the inguinal lymph nodes of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A different strategy that is gaining momentum is autologous fat grafting to the foot. Taking&#xD;
      a patient's own tissue, often from the abdomen or thigh, and transplanting it to areas of&#xD;
      plantar fat pad atrophy may reduce pressure in a more natural and permanent manner. Only one&#xD;
      study to date has been published on autologous fat grafting to the foot, but the patients&#xD;
      were receiving concurrent surgical procedures with their fat grafting and the results were&#xD;
      reported subjectively by the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators hypothesize that there is a difference in plantar tissue&#xD;
      thickness, plantar pressure, and pain score in patients diagnosed with plantar fat pad&#xD;
      atrophy compared to healthy, foot-type matched controls. Results will be measured objectively&#xD;
      using ultrasound for tissue thickness, optical pedobarograph for plantar pressure, and&#xD;
      Manchester foot pain and disability index (MFPDI) for pain score. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      investigators predict that these results will help establish criteria for fad pad atrophy&#xD;
      diagnosis in the clinic as well as determine which patients would receive greatest benefit&#xD;
      from fat grafting to the foot.&#xD;
