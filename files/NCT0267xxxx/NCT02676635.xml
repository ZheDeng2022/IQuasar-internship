  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Masons have the highest rate of overexertion injuries among all construction trades and rank&#xD;
      second as an occupation for back injuries in the United States. Identified ergonomic&#xD;
      solutions are the primary method of reducing exposure to risk factors associated with&#xD;
      musculoskeletal disorders. However, many construction workers lack knowledge about these&#xD;
      solutions, as well as basic ergonomic principles. Construction apprentices, as they embark on&#xD;
      their careers, are greatly in need of ergonomics training to minimize the cumulative exposure&#xD;
      that leads to musculoskeletal disorders. Apprentices receive safety training; however,&#xD;
      ergonomics training is often limited or non-existent. In addition, apprenticeship programs&#xD;
      often lack &quot;soft skills&quot; training on how to appropriately respond to work environments and&#xD;
      practices that are unsafe. The SAVE program - SAfety Voice for Ergonomics - strives to&#xD;
      integrate evidence-based health and safety training strategies into the mason apprenticeship&#xD;
      skills training to teach ergonomics, problem solving, and speaking up to communicate&#xD;
      solutions that reduce musculoskeletal injury risk. The central hypothesis is that the&#xD;
      combination of ergonomics training and safety voice promotion will be more effective than no&#xD;
      training or either ergonomics training alone or safety voice training alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the development and pilot testing of the SAVE intervention, SAVE will be evaluated&#xD;
      in a cluster-randomized controlled trial at 12-15 masonry training centers across the U.S.&#xD;
      Clusters of apprentices within centers will be assigned at random to one of three&#xD;
      intervention groups (n = 32 per group): (1) ergonomics training only, (2) combined ergonomics&#xD;
      and safety voice training, or (3) control group with no additional training intervention.&#xD;
      Outcomes assessed at baseline, at the conclusion of training, and then at six and 12 months&#xD;
      post training will include: musculoskeletal symptoms, general health perceptions, knowledge&#xD;
      of ergonomic and safety voice principles, and perception and attitudes about ergonomic and&#xD;
      safety voice issues.&#xD;

      A. Rationale Masons have the highest rate of overexertion injuries among all construction&#xD;
      trades and rank second as an occupation for back injuries in the United States. Identified&#xD;
      ergonomic solutions are the primary method of reducing exposure to risk factors associated&#xD;
      with musculoskeletal disorders. However, many construction workers lack knowledge about these&#xD;
      solutions, as well as basic ergonomic principles. Construction apprentices have the greatest&#xD;
      need for ergonomics training as they embark on their careers to minimize cumulative exposure&#xD;
      that leads to musculoskeletal disorders. Additionally, apprenticeship training programs often&#xD;
      lack &quot;soft skills&quot; training on how to appropriately respond to work environments and&#xD;
      practices that are unsafe. The SAVE program - SAfety Voice for Ergonomics - strives to&#xD;
      integrate evidence-based health and safety training strategies into current masonry&#xD;
      apprenticeship skills training to teach ergonomics, problem solving, and speaking up to&#xD;
      reduce musculoskeletal injury risk. SAVE will incorporate blended learning principles by&#xD;
      combining traditional, face-to-face teaching methods with e-learning methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Objectives The primary objective of this project is to evaluate the SAVE program in a&#xD;
      cluster randomized controlled trial in 12-15 masonry training centers. Clusters of&#xD;
      apprentices within centers will be assigned at random to one of four intervention groups (n =&#xD;
      32 per group): (1) ergonomics training only, (2) combined ergonomics and safety voice&#xD;
      training, or (3) control group with no additional training intervention. Outcomes assessed at&#xD;
      baseline, at the conclusion of training, and then at 6 and 12 months post training will&#xD;
      include: musculoskeletal symptoms, general health perceptions, knowledge of ergonomic and&#xD;
      safety voice principles, and perception and attitudes about ergonomic and safety voice&#xD;
      issues. The central hypothesis is that the combination of ergonomics training and safety&#xD;
      voice promotion will be more effective than no training or either ergonomics training alone&#xD;
      or safety voice training alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Procedures Primary Training Program E-learning Modules. Depending on the group to which a&#xD;
      training center is assigned, apprentices within that center will view brief e-learning&#xD;
      training modules to provide apprentices with basic knowledge of ergonomic and/or safety voice&#xD;
      principles. These modules include text, brief video clips, and interactive on-screen slides&#xD;
      that guide apprentices through content with brief quizzes that assure understanding.&#xD;
      Apprentices will complete the modules at the apprenticeship training center. Learning gained&#xD;
      from completing the e-learning modules will be reinforced by short (10-20 minute), applied,&#xD;
      face-to-face experiential activities. These interactive, face-to-face, problem-solving&#xD;
      activities will complement the e-learning and will include vignettes to promote discussion of&#xD;
      hypothetical worksite cases related to ergonomics and/or safety voice. These vignettes will&#xD;
      be brief to fit into existing training time demands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary (Refresher) Training Program Refresher training for ergonomics and/or safety voice&#xD;
      will bolster concepts learned by apprentices in the primary training. Depending on the group&#xD;
      to which a training center is assigned, apprentices within that center will receive refresher&#xD;
      training through text messages that are sent by the researchers. Secondary training is&#xD;
      considered medium engagement learning since apprentices will respond to texts. For example,&#xD;
      an ergonomic-related text message would read, &quot;Keeping work between knee and shoulder level&#xD;
      reduces the risk of a back or shoulder injury. During the past week have you worked on&#xD;
      adjustable scaffolding?&quot; The apprentice will respond &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No.&quot; Apprentices responding&#xD;
      &quot;Yes&quot; will receive a follow-up text/email reminding them of the importance of keeping work&#xD;
      between knee and shoulder level. Refresher training will be delivered over a one-year period&#xD;
      to maximize knowledge retention.&#xD;
