    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this Phase 2 study is that at least 1 dose regimen of DS-1971a will&#xD;
      demonstrate clinical superiority to placebo in managing pain associated with DPNP, and will&#xD;
      be generally well tolerated.&#xD;

             baseline period prior to randomization).&#xD;
