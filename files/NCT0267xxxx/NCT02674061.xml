    <textblock>
      This study will assess the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) monotherapy in&#xD;
      female participants with recurrent ovarian cancer (ROC) who have received up to 5 prior lines&#xD;
      of treatment including platinum-based treatment for ROC (1 to 6 total prior lines counting&#xD;
      front line therapy). Participants will be enrolled into two separate cohorts based on the&#xD;
      number of prior lines of treatment received for ROC. There will be no hypothesis testing in&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;

Per RECIST 1.1 PD was defined as ≥20% increase in target lesion SOD and absolute SOD increase of ≥5 mm. Appearance of ≥1 new lesion is also PD. DOR analyzed by KM method is reported here for the subgroup of participants in Cohort A and Cohort B who had a PD-L1 biomarker positive expression defined by IHC as CPS ≥1 and had confirmed CR or PR per RECIST 1.1 by investigator.&#xD;

    <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a pharmaceutical product which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening of a pre-existing condition that was temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product was also an AE. As specified by the protocol, the number of participants who experienced at least one AE is reported here for all participants in Cohort A and Cohort B.</description>

        <title>Duration of Response (DOR) Per RECIST 1.1 by BICR in All Cohort A and Cohort B Participants</title>
        <description>For participants who demonstrated a confirmed CR (disappearance of all target lesions) or PR (≥30% decrease in SOD of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1 based on BICR, DOR was defined as time from first documented CR or PR until progressive disease (PD) or death, whichever occurs first. DOR for participants who didn't progress or die at time of analysis was censored at last tumor assessment. Per RECIST 1.1 PD is a ≥20% increase in target lesion SOD and absolute SOD increase of ≥5 mm. Appearance of ≥1 new lesion is also PD. DOR analyzed by Kaplan-Meier (KM) method is reported here for all participants in Cohort A and Cohort B who had a confirmed CR or PR per RECIST 1.1 by BICR.</description>

          <title>DCR Per RECIST 1.1 by BICR in Subgroup of Cohort A and Cohort B Participants With PD-L1 CPS ≥10</title>
          <description>DCR was defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who had a CR (Disappearance of all target lesions) or PR (≥30% decrease in SOD of target lesions) or SD (Neither sufficient shrinkage for PR nor sufficient increase for PD [at ≥20% increase in target lesion SOD and absolute SOD increase of ≥5 mm. Appearance of ≥1 new lesion is also PD]) or NN (does not qualify for CR or PD) for ≥24 weeks per RECIST 1.1 based on BICR. The percentage of participants who experienced CR, PR, SD or NN per RECIST 1.1 by BICR is reported here as the DCR, analyzed by test of binomial parameter, for the subgroup of participants in Cohort A and Cohort B who had a PD-L1 biomarker positive expression defined by IHC as CPS ≥10.&#xD;

          <description>PFS was defined as the time from first dose of study treatment to the first documented PD per RECIST 1.1 based on BICR, or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Per RECIST 1.1 PD was defined as ≥20% increase in SOD of target lesions and an absolute SOD increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance of ≥1 new lesion is also PD. Per protocol the percentage of participants with PFS (PFS rate) at Month 18 per RECIST 1.1 by BICR is reported here for the subgroup of Cohort A participants with PFI/TFI (duration from end of treatment to disease recurrence) &gt;6-12 months.&#xD;

        <description>DCR was defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who have CR (Disappearance of all target lesions) or PR (≥30% decrease in SOD of target lesions) or SD (Neither sufficient shrinkage for PR nor sufficient increase for PD [at ≥20% increase in target lesion SOD and absolute SOD increase of ≥5 mm. Appearance of ≥1 new lesion is also PD]) or NN (doesn't qualify for CR or PD) for ≥24 weeks per RECIST 1.1 by investigator assessment. Per protocol percentage of participants who experienced CR, PR, SD or NN per RECIST 1.1 by investigator is reported here as DCR, analyzed by test of binomial parameter, for subgroup of Cohort A participants with PFI/TFI (duration from end of treatment to disease recurrence)≥3-6 months.&#xD;

        <title>Percentage of Participants With PFS (PFS Rate) at Month 18 Per RECIST 1.1 by Investigator in Subgroup of Cohort A Participants With PFI/TFI &gt;6-12 Months</title>
        <description>PFS was defined as the time from first dose of study treatment to the first documented PD per RECIST 1.1 by investigator assessment, or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Per RECIST 1.1 PD was defined as ≥20% increase in SOD of target lesions and an absolute SOD increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance of ≥1 new lesion is also PD. Per protocol the percentage of participants with PFS (PFS rate) at Month 18 per RECIST 1.1 by investigator is reported here for the subgroup of Cohort A participants with PFI/TFI (duration from end of treatment to disease recurrence) &gt;6-12 months.&#xD;
Per protocol PFI/TFI &gt;6-12 months subgroup analysis of PFS rate at Month 18 per RECIST 1.1 by investigator was not planned or executed in Cohort B. PFS rate at Month 18 per RECIST 1.1 by investigator was analyzed for all Cohort B participants separately and reported earlier in the record.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Who Experienced an Adverse Event (AE)</title>
        <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a pharmaceutical product which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening of a pre-existing condition that was temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product was also an AE. As specified by the protocol, the number of participants who experienced at least one AE is reported here for all participants in Cohort A and Cohort B.</description>

          <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a pharmaceutical product which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening of a pre-existing condition that was temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product was also an AE. As specified by the protocol, the number of participants who experienced at least one AE is reported here for all participants in Cohort A and Cohort B.</description>
