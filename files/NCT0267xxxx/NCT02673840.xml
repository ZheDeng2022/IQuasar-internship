      Rationale and Aims: Infection by dengue virus (DENV) causes major morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      throughout the world. In 2012, an estimated 3.6 billion people live in areas at risk for DENV&#xD;
      infection, including Singapore. The key pathology of DENV infection is vascular leakage,&#xD;
      which can occur in mild cases and can become life-threatening in severe cases when patients&#xD;
      may develop dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Mast cells (MCs)&#xD;
      are strongly activated by DENV with preliminary studies showing that activation levels are&#xD;
      correlated to disease severity in human patients. Thus, the investigators propose to use the&#xD;
      MC stabilizing drug, ketotifen, to limit the immune pathology that is characteristic of&#xD;
      dengue infection and treat dengue-induced vascular leakage. Methods: The ability of Ketotifen&#xD;
      to reduce vascular leakage in DENV patients will be determined by assessing the pooling of&#xD;
      fluid in the pleural cavity (measured by MRI and CXR) after 5 days of drug administration,&#xD;
      evaluated as a percent change compared to baseline fluid levels. Additional measures of&#xD;
      vascular leakage and immune pathology will be compared as secondary objectives. The trial&#xD;
      will be conducted as a randomized, double-blind study comparing the responses of dengue&#xD;
      patients given either ketotifen or placebo (n=55 per arm). Importance of proposed research:&#xD;
      Currently, no targeted treatments exist to limit vascular leakage during DENV infection. If&#xD;
      Ketotifen is identified as effective for preventing pleural effusion and/or plasma leakage in&#xD;
      DENV patients, this would constitute an advance for the clinical management of DENV fever.&#xD;
      This finding would also support a large-scale trial to determine whether Ketotifen can be&#xD;
      used to prevent severe vascular leakage as occurs during DHF/DSS. Benefits/Risks: Ketotifen&#xD;
      has a record of safety and tolerability in humans, regulatory approval, and widespread use.&#xD;
      Side effects are generally mild. The potential exists that, if effective, many of the painful&#xD;
      and life-threatening symptoms of DENV infection that result from plasma leakage would be&#xD;
      improved.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 230 million individuals are infected each year by dengue virus (DENV) a&#xD;
      Flavivirus spread by mosquito vectors that causes substantial worldwide morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. Infection by DENV results in dengue fever (DF), which is usually a self-limiting&#xD;
      illness. However, many individuals can experience much more severe forms of disease, such as&#xD;
      dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS), which are characterized by&#xD;
      widespread vascular pathology, the most prominent manifestation of which is plasma leakage&#xD;
      that can lead to shock and, potentially, death. Currently, treatment for DHF/DSS is&#xD;
      supportive care with analgesics, fluid replacement and bed rest. Management of severe DENV&#xD;
      infections typically requires prolonged hospitalization accompanied by careful fluid&#xD;
      management . At this time, there are no targeted treatments for DF, DHF or DSS, making&#xD;
      improvements in care for DENV patients an urgent clinical need. In particular, there is a&#xD;
      need for therapeutic intervention to prevent the vascular leakage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Animal studies suggested that drugs in the class of mast cell (MC) &quot;stabilizers&quot; can&#xD;
      effectively limit vascular leakage in mouse models of DENV infection. Drugs targeting MCs&#xD;
      have been in use in humans for decades, particularly for the treatment of allergy and asthma.&#xD;
      One &quot;MC stabilizer&quot;, ketotifen, acts by preventing degranulation of MCs. Ketotifen is an oral&#xD;
      drug currently used to prevent asthma. It is most commonly supplied in the form of a salt&#xD;
      with fumaric acid, as ketotifen fumarate. Ketotifen has a clinical track record of greater&#xD;
      than 30 years as a safe drug and it is currently approved for use in Singapore. In other&#xD;
      formulations it is also used to treat irritation and reduce vascular leakage, such as in the&#xD;
      eye. It is a MC stabilizing agent that prevents degranulation of MCs, as well as the&#xD;
      production of additional mediators that are not contained within MC granules, including&#xD;
      leukotrienes and platelet activating factor. Ketotifen also functions as an antihistamine&#xD;
      with direct H1-receptor blocking function. The bioavailability of an oral dose of ketotifen&#xD;
      in humans is approximately 80-90% . Drug levels peak in the serum between 2-4 hours after&#xD;
      ingestion. Patients with asthma sometimes require treatment with ketotifen for weeks prior to&#xD;
      observing improved asthmatic responses, but this is thought to represent the time required&#xD;
      for chronic inflammation to subside and not the time required for MC stabilization, which&#xD;
      occurs immediately in animal models. The mean elimination half-life of ketotifen is 12 hours.&#xD;
      Side effects include drowsiness, dry mouth, slight dizziness, central nervous system (CNS)&#xD;
      stimulation and weight gain. Patients are commonly prescribed 1-2mg tablets, twice a day.&#xD;
      Treatment of DENV-infected mice with MC stabilizers, cromolyn or ketotifen, resulted reduced&#xD;
      vascular leakage compared to untreated controls in two separate mouse models of DENV&#xD;
      infection. These findings were apparent using two separate measures of vascular leakage as&#xD;
      the endpoint readout: evans blue perfusion, which is a key experimental technique to show&#xD;
      plasma leakage into tissues, and hematocrit analysis, which is the clinical parameter that is&#xD;
      most commonly used to diagnose DHF in human patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, clinical study of ketotifen in adults&#xD;
      with dengue infection. The study will be conducted as an outpatient study at National&#xD;
      University Hospital (NUH) and Singapore General Hospital (SGH), daily with the MRIs and chest&#xD;
      X-rays conducted at the Clinical Imaging Research Centre (CIRC) of the National University of&#xD;
      Singapore (NUS). A final visit at convalescence (Day 21) can be at the site of enrolment. One&#xD;
      hundred and ten (110) patients will be randomized 1:1 to ketotifen or placebo. A baseline MRI&#xD;
      of the pleural cavity, liver, spleen and kidney will be taken. Tablets of placebo or&#xD;
      ketotifen will be self-administered for 5 days. Patients will be given daily clinical exams,&#xD;
      Day 1 to Day 5, and blood samples will be collected for plasma chymase levels, viral load,&#xD;
      hematology, clinical chemistry, inflammatory product profiling and additional laboratory&#xD;
      tests. After the administration of the final dose of drug, blood will be drawn and a follow&#xD;
      up MRI will be performed at the CIRC in NUS to assess fluid accumulation within the pleural&#xD;
      cavity as a primary clinical endpoint, with assessment of the liver, spleen and kidney as&#xD;
      experimental endpoints.&#xD;
