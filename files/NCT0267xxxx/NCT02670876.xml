    <textblock>
      The investigators recruited school bullying perpetrators from the age of 12 to 17 by referral&#xD;
      from the local police department. An anti-bullying intervention based on cognitive-behavioral&#xD;
      therapy (CBT) principles was conducted, and addressed issues related to impulse control,&#xD;
      empathy and communication enhancement. All participants completed brain magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging, neurocognitive tests, and questionnaires before and after the intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study included previous perpetrators of school bullying who were convicted for a&#xD;
      minor offense, including physical or verbal assaults or theft, and who were referred by the&#xD;
      police to participate in an anti-bullying intervention. The program consisted of 8 sessions&#xD;
      over 4 weeks and was conducted by a board-certified psychiatrist and a therapist with&#xD;
      previous training in psychosocial treatments. The intervention was based on CBT principles&#xD;
      and addressed various factors that have been associated with perpetrators of school bullying,&#xD;
      including impulse control, perspective taking (empathy), and the enhancement of communication&#xD;
      skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants completed the Korean Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and&#xD;
      Schizophrenia-Present and Lifetime version (K-SADS-PL) administered by board-certified child&#xD;
      and adolescent psychiatrists. The validity and reliability of the original and Korean&#xD;
      versions of the K-SADS-PL have been established. Intelligence quotient (IQ) was measured&#xD;
      using the Korean Educational Developmental Institute's Wechsler Intelligence Scale for&#xD;
      Children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to and after participation in the program, all participants underwent brain magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (structural and functional) and completed neurocognitive tests that&#xD;
      included the continuous performance test (CPT), the Stroop Word and Color Test, and the&#xD;
      Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). The parents of the participants completed questionnaires&#xD;
      including the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Written informed consent was obtained from the&#xD;
      parents and the participants after sufficient explanation of the study. The study protocol&#xD;
      was approved by the institutional review board of the Seoul National University Hospital.&#xD;
