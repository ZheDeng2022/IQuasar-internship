      The primary purpose of this study is to compare the effects of two different methods of care&#xD;
      during the second stage of labor for nulliparous women (coached versus uncoached pushing) on&#xD;
      the length of the second stage and how this may affect maternal and neonatal outcome.&#xD;

      The study was conducted on 434 primigravidae women admitted to Kasr El Ainy teaching&#xD;
      Maternity Hospital for labor. The study will be done in the period between October 2015 and&#xD;
      April 2016. The study will include 434 women with the diagnosis of the first stage of labor&#xD;
      with at least cervical dilatation 4cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical approval obtained and an informed consent will be taken from each patient after&#xD;
      explaining the nature and scope of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology in details:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Careful and detailed history taking regarding:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Personal history&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Complaint.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  History of present pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Menstrual History.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Past history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Careful general examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Abdominal examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Local vaginal examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Ultrasound examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management of Cases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group (I)(Coached group):&#xD;
&#xD;
      It includes 217 patients who are admitted in active stage of labor (cervical dilatation 4cm&#xD;
      at least) to labor delivery ward. They are coached by the nurse to use closed-glottis and&#xD;
      pushing three to four times during each contraction immediately when cervical dilation&#xD;
      reached 10 cm and to continue pushing using this method with each contraction until birth.&#xD;
      The nurse counts to 10 during each pushing effort to assist the woman in holding her breath&#xD;
      for at least 10 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group (II)(Uncoached group):&#xD;
&#xD;
      It includes 217 patients who are admitted early in active stage of labor (cervical dilatation&#xD;
      4cm at least) to labor delivery ward at 10-cm cervical dilation where they remain until they&#xD;
      feel the urge to push or the second stage had lasted 2 hours (whichever came first)., they&#xD;
      are encouraged to bear down with contractions without holding their breath (open-glottis) for&#xD;
      no more than 6-8 seconds and continue bearing down no more than three times with each&#xD;
      contraction until birth. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients admitted early in labor are subjected to active management of labor as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pelvic examination performed. Routine amniotomy performed and progress assessed. When&#xD;
      dilatation is not increasing, a low dose protocol of oxytocin infusion will be started.&#xD;
      Oxytocin diluted in the form of 5IU in 500 ml Ringer lactate making a concentration of nearly&#xD;
      1mu oxytocin/1ml Ringer solution. Infusion instituted at a rate of 1 -2 milliunit (15-30&#xD;
      drops) per minute and increased gradually in increments of 1 -2 milliunit per minute at 30&#xD;
      minutes interval, until at least three uterine contractions noted in a 10 minute period using&#xD;
      cardio tocograph.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of each stage of labor was performed as follow:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. First stage of labor:&#xD;
&#xD;
           It includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Duration of the first stage of labor.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Rate of cervical dilatation and foetal descent.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Adequacy of uterine contractions and documentation of labor dystocia.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Excess uterine activity consisted of uterine tachysystole, hypertonus or uterine&#xD;
                hyperstimulation&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Second stage of labor:&#xD;
&#xD;
           It includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Duration of the second stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Rate of the descent of foetus.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Monitoring of foetal heart rate every 5 minutes by sonicaid or continuous by CTG.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Use of mediolateral episiotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Intervention will be considered either by instrumental delivery,fundal pressure or&#xD;
                by CS If the second stage is prolonged more than 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Monitoring of maternal oxygen saturation by pulse oximeter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Third stage of labor:&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Duration of the third stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Assessment of any vaginal laceration or perineal tears with their repair as well as&#xD;
           repair of episiotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Assessment of quantity of blood loss and assessment of uterine atony(vital&#xD;
           instability,number of soaked pads and hemoglobin drop) .&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Rate of caesarean section during varying stages of labor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Neonatal assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Foetal sex and body weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  APGAR score at 1 and 5 minutes..&#xD;
