      BACKGROUND: The degree of consciousness during nitrous oxide use is still a matter of concern&#xD;
      for both dentists and anesthesiologists. Investigators hypothesized that BIS levels do not&#xD;
      vary according nitrous oxide concentration during minimum to moderate sedation in the dental&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: One hundred patients undergoing dental procedures demanding local anesthesia (1.8 mL&#xD;
      of 2% lidocaine with 1:100.000 epinephrine) were enrolled in this study. Initial pain and&#xD;
      anxiety were measured by 11-point numerical and anxiety visual scales, respectively.&#xD;
      Systolic/diastolic arterial blood pressure, SpO2, heart and respiratory rates, and&#xD;
      psychomotor ability (Trieger test) were assessed before, during and after dental treatment.&#xD;
      Sedation levels were evaluated by both BIS and sedation analogic scale at the same intervals.&#xD;
      The duration of treatment along with nitrous oxide concentration and side effects were&#xD;
      observed. Kruskal-Wallis, Friedman and Mann-Whitney tests were used (alpha=5%).&#xD;

      One-hundred ASA I / II volunteers of both genders were selected in different dental&#xD;
      speciality clinics (restorative dentistry, endodontics, implantology, and oral surgery) of&#xD;
      Dental Institute of Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro PUC-Rio).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After anamnesis and obtaining written informed consent, all volunteers were asked to fill an&#xD;
      11-point numerical scale in order to quantify the initial pain. The scale showed 0 as &quot;no&#xD;
      pain&quot; and 10 as the &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot;. In addition, volunteers were also asked to fill&#xD;
      a facial image scale in order to determine the initial anxiety. This scale showed four&#xD;
      levels: 0 corresponding to absolutely calm; 1 - slightly stressed; 2 - stressed; and 3 -&#xD;
      extremely stressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The volunteers were positioned in the dental chair and instructed to fill a Trieger test&#xD;
      (psychomotor evaluation) during the following periods: 1) before sedation; 2) during the&#xD;
      sedation (10 minutes after respiratory stabilization with N2O/O2); and 3) 10 minutes after&#xD;
      the end of sedation. The number of wrong connected points (precision) and the time required&#xD;
      to fill all points were used to estimate psychomotor ability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pulse oxymeter was placed in the volunteers' thumb and an electronic sphygmomanometer was&#xD;
      positioned in the forearm in order to evaluate oxygen saturation (SpO2), systolic and&#xD;
      diastolic pressures, and hearth rate during the same moments of the Trieger test. Respiratory&#xD;
      rate was evaluated at same moments, by direct observation of thoracic movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The electrodes of BIS monitor were placed and the values were obtained at same operatory&#xD;
      periods previously described, despite the continuous BIS monitoring. After BIS-signal&#xD;
      stabilization, the dental procedure and the sedation with N2O/O2 were explained to the&#xD;
      volunteer. Two previously calibrated operators installed BIS electrodes, applied the Trieger&#xD;
      test and sedated all subjects. A third operator performed the dental treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five minutes after reaching ideal sedation level, the anesthetic solution (1.8 mL of 2%&#xD;
      lidocaine with 1:100.000 epinephrine) was injected. Right after the end of clinical&#xD;
      procedure, 100% O2 were provided during 5 minutes and a new Trieger test was filled out. The&#xD;
      volunteer was dismissed if this last Trieger test was compatible with the first one. At this&#xD;
      moment, they were also asked about discomfort or complications. The duration and type of&#xD;
      dental procedure were also registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The N2O/O2 equipment was composed by two flow meters with an anti-hypoxia system valve, 70%&#xD;
      N2O maximum disposal and 30 L/min O2 valve to immediate oxygen dispensation. Masks were&#xD;
      individually selected, being 100% O2 (6 L/min) dispensed until respiratory rate&#xD;
      stabilization. N2O was incremented at 10% each 2 minutes (70% max, if necessary) until some&#xD;
      of the following signals were noticed: silence, relax/comfort report, decreased eyelid&#xD;
      movements, decreased spontaneous body movements, warm sensation, tingling sensation or&#xD;
      numbness at feet, hands or oral region, and slightly euphoric sensation. The dental procedure&#xD;
      started after 5 min from the ideal sedation achievement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sedation level was scored by using the five-points Observer's Assessment of&#xD;
      Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S) scale, previously described elsewhere. In addition, BIS was used&#xD;
      to monitoring brain cortical activity at 0.5 to 30 Hz frequency bandwidth, checking impedance&#xD;
      before every reading. Impedance remained below 800 ohms. Zipprep-type electrodes were placed&#xD;
      according to manufacturer instructions. Fp1-Fpz was monitored in channel 1, Fp2-Fpz in&#xD;
      channel 2 and the ground reference was placed on the pre-auricular region. BIS and both BIS&#xD;
      channel waves were recorded from successive 2 seconds periods 13 and updated at every 5&#xD;
      seconds. The automatic artifact detection and rejection system of the BIS monitor were used.&#xD;
      Baseline levels were obtained before sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results were submitted to Kruskal-Wallis' (Dunn), Friedman's, Mann-Whitney's and Spearman's&#xD;
      correlation tests. The significance level was set at 5%. The analysis was performed by using&#xD;
      BioEstat 5.0.&#xD;
