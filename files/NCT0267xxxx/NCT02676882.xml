    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of the EnBrace HR prenatal&#xD;
      supplement in preventing depression in women with a history of depression who have decided to&#xD;
      stop taking antidepressants during their pregnancy, or treating women who are currently in a&#xD;
      depressive episode while pregnant or planning pregnancy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) occurs twice as often in women as in men, with an age of&#xD;
      onset that coincides with the childbearing years. As over 20% of reproductive-age women&#xD;
      experience an episode of depression, identifying safe and effective treatments for depression&#xD;
      before, during and after pregnancy has become a critical public health issue. Historically,&#xD;
      pregnancy has been viewed as a protective time with respect to risk for psychiatric&#xD;
      illnesses, which has resulted in a lack of prospective systematic investigations on the&#xD;
      subject of acute treatment and prevention of MDD while women are planning to conceive and&#xD;
      during pregnancy. Contrary to previous assumptions, recent large-scale studies demonstrate&#xD;
      that new onset and recurrence of depressive episodes occur commonly during pregnancy and the&#xD;
      postpartum periods. The current standard of treatment for recurrent major depression is&#xD;
      maintenance antidepressant (AD) therapy, due to the high risk of recurrence among patients&#xD;
      who discontinue maintenance AD therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although ADs are frequently used during pregnancy, concerns remain regarding a spectrum of&#xD;
      adverse outcomes associated with fetal exposure to these medications including: increased&#xD;
      risk for teratogenicity compromised obstetrical outcomes and a variety of negative neonatal&#xD;
      clinical syndromes. Given these concerns, reproductive age women treated with AD frequently&#xD;
      elect to discontinue their medications proximate to pregnancy or immediately after becoming&#xD;
      pregnant despite the known increased risk for relapse or recurrence. With the exception of&#xD;
      observational data that demonstrate that women who discontinue medication around the time of&#xD;
      conception are at high risk of recurrence, no previous studies are available to inform&#xD;
      clinical treatment regarding medication discontinuation for a planned pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This leaves women who are successfully treated with ADs and want to become pregnant caught in&#xD;
      the difficult clinical dilemma of weighing the risks of fetal exposure to medication against&#xD;
      the potential impact of untreated maternal depression during pregnancy. Clinical decisions&#xD;
      are made even more complex by the fact that most studies are far from definitive in terms of&#xD;
      comparing the risks of in utero exposure to ADs to the risks of untreated antenatal mood&#xD;
      disorder. Given this level of uncertainty, many women and their health care providers would&#xD;
      welcome evidence-based non-psychotropic interventions as an alternative to ADs in order to&#xD;
      prevent recurrence in euthymic women with histories of MDD as they plan pregnancy. However,&#xD;
      the potential efficacy of non-psychotropic interventions for this population has not been&#xD;
      systematically investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is consistent and growing evidence of a role for various folate forms in the prevention&#xD;
      and treatment of depression. In fact, there is compelling evidence that treatment with a&#xD;
      methylfolate agent would not only avoid the potential risks of antidepressants in pregnancy,&#xD;
      but would also confer important benefits to pregnancy and child outcomes as well, such as&#xD;
      prevention of major birth defects and longer term neurodevelopmental outcomes. To date, there&#xD;
      is an evidence base for antidepressant effects for folic acid, folinic acid, and&#xD;
      methylfolate, and similar findings may be attributable to the fact that these folate forms&#xD;
      share an interconversion potential in the complex set of pathways that comprise the&#xD;
      one-carbon cycle. These reactions, which in turn depend on B12 and homocysteine availability,&#xD;
      are postulated to exert an antidepressant effect by impacting the synthesis of&#xD;
      neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some but not all studies suggest efficacy of folate monotherapy for MDD, but this&#xD;
      intervention may be limited by the common occurence of polymorphisms in the general&#xD;
      population that make folate a less efficient one-carbon cycle constituent than&#xD;
      L-methylfolate. Since certain polymorphisms that impair methylation processes and the&#xD;
      conversion of folate into its active form, methylfolate, have been found to be&#xD;
      overrepresented in individuals with depression, methylfolate may be a more effective form of&#xD;
      folate supplementation to target MDD. Also, methylfolate may be more readily absorbed in the&#xD;
      brain compared to other folate forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, Fava and colleagues demonstrated that L-methylfolate is significantly superior to&#xD;
      placebo for the treatment of major depressive disorder in patients who had failed to respond&#xD;
      to AD therapy alone. In addition, several other open and blinded studies of methylfolate&#xD;
      monotherapy in a variety of depressed populations have found that patients experienced&#xD;
      significant improvement in depressive symptoms with no drug-related adverse events. Although&#xD;
      more controlled data are needed, initial studies indicate that methylfolate may be a safe and&#xD;
      effective option for the treatment of depression, especially in populations that are&#xD;
      vulnerable to medication-related adverse events, and those who are folate deficient or whose&#xD;
      folate needs are elevated, such as the case in pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EnBrace HR is a prescription prenatal/postnatal dietary management product that contains&#xD;
      vitamins and minerals, including folic acid and methylfolate. It meets the above criteria as&#xD;
      a potential ideal candidate for the prevention of depression in pregnancy. It contains&#xD;
      L-methylfolate and other folate derivatives, and is optimal for a population with high rates&#xD;
      of polymorphisms that affect folic acid metabolism. It also contains omega-3 fatty acids,&#xD;
      primarily eicosapentaenoic acid, which shows promise for the treatment of depression.&#xD;
      Importantly, these components are crucial for healthy pregnancies. Folic acid supplementation&#xD;
      has been associated with the reduced risk of neural tube defects and is recommended for use&#xD;
      in women of reproductive potential to reduce the risk of birth defects, although a&#xD;
      substantial proportion of the population are poor folic acid metabolizers. Methylfolate&#xD;
      compounds specifically may provide a more efficient delivery of folate-related compounds to&#xD;
      this end.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Very few studies have examined treatments specifically to assist patients that discontinue&#xD;
      ADs, and none have examined this during the time proximate to attempts to conceive, or during&#xD;
      pregnancy, which is particularly relevant due to safety concerns. The adaptation of a&#xD;
      non-psychotropic treatment, such as EnBrace, for use in women who are planning pregnancy or&#xD;
      who are pregnant who choose to discontinue maintenance AD treatment would broaden treatment&#xD;
      choices available during this important time in the female life-cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The overarching goal of this investigation is to assess EnBrace as a treatment for&#xD;
      the acute treatment and prevention of depression in women with a history of major depressive&#xD;
      disorder who decide to avoid or discontinue their maintenance AD treatment for pregnancy.&#xD;
      After completing this protocol, we plan to use the preliminary data for the development of a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial protocol. We will include two groups of women who are interested&#xD;
      in minimizing medication exposures while trying to conceive or during pregnancy: 1) women who&#xD;
      have histories of depression and are not depressed, and would like to stop antidepressants&#xD;
      for pregnancy, 2) women in depressive episodes who are pregnant or trying to conceive (on or&#xD;
      off of antidepressant medications).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1a: To evaluate the efficacy of EnBrace when used as maintenance treatment for&#xD;
      MDD in a group of women (N=10) who are trying to conceive or are early in pregnancy and who&#xD;
      have decided to stop ADs (Group 1). Relapse rates for women in this context have been&#xD;
      demonstrated to be high, with 68% relapse rates in a large multisite NIMH-funded trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1b: To evaluate the efficacy of EnBrace when used as an acute treatment for MDD&#xD;
      in a group of women (N=10) who are trying to conceive or are early in pregnancy (Group 2).&#xD;
      Women will have major depressive episodes in this group, and may receive EnBrace as&#xD;
      monotherapy, or as an adjunct to current pharmacotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1a: We hypothesize that relapse rates will be lower for women who receive EnBrace&#xD;
      compared to historical controls. MDD relapse will be determined by the Mini-International&#xD;
      Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) mood module that will be administered by a study clinician&#xD;
      at each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1b: We hypothesize that the majority of women who receive EnBrace will experience&#xD;
      a response (50% improvement in depressive symptoms) to EnBrace therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To identify biological markers as potential predictors of response to&#xD;
      EnBrace.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: We hypothesize that pre- to post-treatment changes in homocysteine, folate,&#xD;
      B12, IL-6 and CRP will be associated with response to EnBrace. We hypothesize specifically&#xD;
      that levels of folate and B12 will increase and homocysteine will decrease temporally with&#xD;
      treatment and be predictive of prevention of depressive episodes. We hypothesize that&#xD;
      treatment will lower IL-6 and CRP levels due to the anti-inflammatory components of EnBrace&#xD;
      (i.e., omega-3 fatty acids) and that decreased levels of inflammatory markers may predict&#xD;
      lower risk of depressive relapse in participants who enter the study while not on a&#xD;
      depressive episode (Group 1), and will predict response to treatment in women who enter the&#xD;
      study while in a depressive episode (Group 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3 (Exploratory): To identify factors influencing adherence to and tolerability&#xD;
      of treatment. This will be achieved by using qualitative methods to explore (a) perceived&#xD;
      risks and benefits of treatment; (b) perceived side effect profile; (c) treatment&#xD;
      convenience; (d) knowledge of, attitudes towards, and preferences for depression treatment&#xD;
      while attempting to conceive or early pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: We hypothesize that EnBrace will be perceived by patients as 1) an acceptable&#xD;
      and attractive treatment with a favorable risk/benefit profile in the context of pregnancy or&#xD;
      while trying to conceive, 2) well tolerated, 3) convenient and easy to adhere to, 4) will be&#xD;
      a treatment that women who are trying to conceive or who are pregnant find intuitive and&#xD;
      preferable to prescription antidepressant medication (or for women on antidepressant&#xD;
      treatment in Group 2, who prefer the augmentation with EnBrace rather than an increase in&#xD;
      antidepressant dose or augmentation with a prescription psychotropic medication).&#xD;

The MINI is a brief, validated structured clinical interview used for diagnostic purposes for DSM-IV and ICD-10 psychiatric disorders in clinical trials. The interview is performed by a licensed study physician and takes about 15 minutes. The MINI is divided into modules corresponding to diagnostic categories, and questions are answered as a binary yes or no by the research subject. The MINI mood module in this case refers to the set of questions examining major depressive disorder symptoms to identify if a patient is experiencing depressive symptoms that meet criteria as a major depressive episode.</description>

          <title>Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview Major Depressive Episode Module</title>
          <description>A brief, validated structured clinical interview used for diagnostic purposes for DSM-IV and ICD-10 psychiatric disorders in clinical trials. The interview is performed by a licensed study physician and takes about 15 minutes. The MINI is divided into modules corresponding to diagnostic categories, and questions are answered as a binary yes or no by the research subject. The MINI mood module in this case refers to the set of questions examining major depressive disorder symptoms to identify if a patient is experiencing depressive symptoms that meet criteria as a major depressive episode.</description>

        <description>Evidence of recurrence of major depression episode, as defined by the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) mood module and/or research clinician interview. The MINI is a brief, validated structured clinical interview used for diagnostic purposes for DSM-IV and ICD-10 psychiatric disorders in clinical trials. The interview is performed by a licensed study physician and takes about 15 minutes. The MINI is divided into modules corresponding to diagnostic categories, and questions are answered as a binary yes or no by the research subject. The MINI mood module in this case refers to the set of questions examining major depressive disorder symptoms to identify if a patient is experiencing depressive symptoms that meet criteria as a major depressive episode.</description>
