    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 6 in the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) Total Tic Score (TTS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The YGTSS is designed to rate the overall severity of motor and phonic tic symptoms across a range of dimensions: number, frequency, intensity, complexity, and interference. The YGTSS was administered by the investigator (or qualified designee) using a computer-based structured clinical interview. The TTS is the sum of the 5 motor tic items and the 5 phonic (vocal) tic items and ranges from 0 to 50, with higher scores representing greater severity</description>

    <measure>Clinical Global Impression of Tourette Syndrome (CGI-TS) - Improvement Score at Week 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-TS-Improvement scale is used to assess overall improvement since the initiation of study drug dosing on a 7-point scale. Each of the CGI-TS-Improvement response categories was assigned a numerical score as follows: 1 = Very much improved; 2 = Much improved; 3 = Minimally improved; 4 = Not changed; 5 = Minimally worse; 6 = Much worse; 7 = Very much worse.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Participants Who Are a YGTSS TTS Responder at Week 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>A TTS responder is defined, on a per-visit basis, as a participant whose TTS value is reduced by at least 30% from baseline at the specified postbaseline visit.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 6 in the YGTSS Impairment Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The YGTSS Impairment item is used to rate impairment due to tics using the following 50-point anchored scale: 0 = None; 10 = Minimal; 20 = Mild; 30 = Moderate; 40 = Marked; 50 = Severe.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 6 in the YGTSS Global Tic Severity Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The YGTSS Global Tic Severity score is the sum of the YGTSS TTS and the YGTSS Impairment score and ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores representing greater severity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 6 in the Rush Video-based Tic Rating Scale (RTRS) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>A modified RTRS was used in this study that includes short video recordings to measure 5 tic variables: number of body areas affected, frequency of motor and phonic tics, and severity of motor and phonic tics. The RTRS total score is calculated as the sum of the 5 domain scores, and ranges from 0 to 20, with higher scores representing greater severity. The final on-treatment visit was used in participants who discontinued prior to Week 6.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 6 in the Premonitory Urge for Tics Scale (PUTS) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The PUTS is an instrument for quantifying the premonitory urge phenomena associated with tics. It consists of 9 items, each of which is scored on a 4-point scale (1=not at all true, 2=a little true, 3=pretty much true, 4=very much true). The PUTS total score is calculated as the sum of the scores for the 9 items. The total score ranges from 9 to 36, with higher scores indicating a worse outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 6 in the Clinical Global Impression of Tics (CGI-Tics) - Severity Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-Tics-Severity scale is used to assess overall severity on a 7-point scale. Each of the CGI-Tics-Severity response categories was assigned a numerical score as follows: 1 = Normal, not at all ill; 2 = Borderline ill; 3 = Mildly ill; 4 = Moderately ill; 5 = Markedly ill; 6 = Severely ill; 7 = Among the most extremely ill patient.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Participants Who Are a CGI-TS-Improvement Responder at Week 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>A participant is classified as a CGI-TS-Improvement responder at a given visit if their CGI-TS-Improvement score is either a &quot;1&quot; (&quot;very much improved&quot;) or a &quot;2&quot; (&quot;much improved&quot;) at the visit.</description>

          <title>Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) Total Tic Score (TTS)</title>
          <description>The YGTSS is designed to rate the overall severity of motor and phonic tic symptoms across a range of dimensions: number, frequency, intensity, complexity, and interference. The YGTSS was administered by the investigator (or qualified designee) using a computer-based structured clinical interview. The TTS is the sum of the 5 motor tic items and the 5 phonic (vocal) tic items and ranges from 0 to 50, with higher scores representing greater severity</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 6 in the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) Total Tic Score (TTS)</title>
        <description>The YGTSS is designed to rate the overall severity of motor and phonic tic symptoms across a range of dimensions: number, frequency, intensity, complexity, and interference. The YGTSS was administered by the investigator (or qualified designee) using a computer-based structured clinical interview. The TTS is the sum of the 5 motor tic items and the 5 phonic (vocal) tic items and ranges from 0 to 50, with higher scores representing greater severity</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6</time_frame>
        <population>The intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis set included all randomized participants who received at least one dose of study drug, had postbaseline safety data, and had a baseline (Day -1) and at least one postrandomization TTS value reported at a scheduled or mapped early termination (ET) visit during the 6-week treatment period. Dose levels based on age group were prespecified to be combined within each dose arm.</population>

          <description>The YGTSS Impairment item is used to rate impairment due to tics using the following 50-point anchored scale: 0 = None; 10 = Minimal; 20 = Mild; 30 = Moderate; 40 = Marked; 50 = Severe.</description>
          <population>The ITT analysis set included all randomized participants who received at least one dose of study drug, had postbaseline safety data, and had a baseline (Day -1) and at least one postrandomization TTS value reported at a scheduled or mapped early termination (ET) visit during the 6-week treatment period. Dose levels based on age group were prespecified to be combined within each dose arm.</population>

        <description>The PUTS is an instrument for quantifying the premonitory urge phenomena associated with tics. It consists of 9 items, each of which is scored on a 4-point scale (1=not at all true, 2=a little true, 3=pretty much true, 4=very much true). The PUTS total score is calculated as the sum of the scores for the 9 items. The total score ranges from 9 to 36, with higher scores indicating a worse outcome.</description>

        <description>The CGI-Tics-Severity scale is used to assess overall severity on a 7-point scale. Each of the CGI-Tics-Severity response categories was assigned a numerical score as follows: 1 = Normal, not at all ill; 2 = Borderline ill; 3 = Mildly ill; 4 = Moderately ill; 5 = Markedly ill; 6 = Severely ill; 7 = Among the most extremely ill patient.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6</time_frame>
        <population>The ITT analysis set included all randomized participants who received at least one dose of study drug, had postbaseline safety data, and had a baseline (Day -1) and at least one postrandomization TTS value reported at a scheduled or mapped early termination (ET) visit during the 6-week treatment period. Dose levels based on age group were prespecified to be combined within each dose arm.</population>
