      To evaluate the efficacy of maintenance therapies following completion of standard first-line&#xD;
      chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER-2 positive or HER-2 negative&#xD;
      oesophago-gastric adenocarcinomas.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open label, multicentre, randomised phase II clinical trial. An&#xD;
      adaptive trial design is proposed to allow ineffective treatments to be discontinued early,&#xD;
      and to potentially add novel treatment arms as the trial progresses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will initially receive standard chemotherapy for their locally advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic oesophago-gastric adenocarcinoma, according to local practice based upon their&#xD;
      HER-2 status (tested locally). In order to be eligible for trial entry, HER-2 negative&#xD;
      patients should have received a platinum-fluoropyrimidine based chemotherapy doublet or&#xD;
      triplet (Arm A), whilst HER-2 positive patients (IHC 3+ or IHC 2+ and FISH positive) should&#xD;
      have received cisplatin in combination with either capecitabine or 5-FU (CX or CF) plus&#xD;
      trastuzumab chemotherapy (Arm B). Potentially eligible patients will be registered with the&#xD;
      trials office whilst undergoing first line chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will then become eligible for trial recruitment and randomization following&#xD;
      completion of at least 6 cycles of standard chemotherapy with ≥SD (stable disease) or better&#xD;
      on the end-of-treatment CT scan. Eligible patients will then be randomised according to HER-2&#xD;
      status as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HER-2 positive patients (~20%) will be currently not be randomised and will be assigned&#xD;
           maintenance single-agent trastuzumab (current UK standard), a comparator arm is in&#xD;
           development.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HER-2 negative patients (~80%) will be randomised in a 1:1:1 fashion between&#xD;
           surveillance only (current UK standard), maintenance capecitabine, or maintenance&#xD;
           immuno-modulatory therapy (anti-PD-L1 antibody)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be stratified according to: locally advanced disease versus metastatic disease,&#xD;
      and performance status (0 versus 1 versus 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Review of patients will occur every 4 weeks in the observation only arm. In maintenance&#xD;
      therapy arms, patients will be reviewed every 3 or every 4 weeks depending upon the treatment&#xD;
      strategy. CT assessments of response will occur every 12 weeks (3 months) in all arms of the&#xD;
      trial. Treatment will be continued indefinitely until the occurrence of either disease&#xD;
      progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient withdrawal for another reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial is being run from the RMH GI clinical trials unit with Professor David Cunningham&#xD;
      as the over-arching CI. Effective arms in the phase II portion of the trial may be taken&#xD;
      forward into a phase III maintenance trial powered for overall survival. It is also hoped&#xD;
      that, as more robust data becomes available for other biomarker-selected populations (e.g.&#xD;
      MET-positive, FGFR-amplified), it may be possible to amend the overall trial design to&#xD;
      incorporate these biomarker-targeted maintenance therapies in the HER-2 negative population.&#xD;
