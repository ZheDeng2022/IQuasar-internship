      This trial is a prospective, multi-center, single-arm First-In-Man Continuation study to&#xD;
      evaluate safety and efficacy of the VenTouch System for treatment of subjects with functional&#xD;
      MR enrolling up to 15 subjects who have been diagnosed with Grade 3-4 functional mitral valve&#xD;
      regurgitation. The duration of the study follow-up is 36 months from the time of therapy&#xD;
      adjustment. Data from this trial may be utilized in support of a CE study in Europe and/or a&#xD;
      pilot IDE study in the U.S. Follow-up testing will be performed at 1 month, 3 months, 6&#xD;
      months, and 12, 24, and 36 months post-therapy adjustment.&#xD;

    <description>The VenTouch System is intended for use in the treatment of functional MR (FMR) in adults who are symptomatic despite optimal medical management. It is intended for subjects with FMR with essentially normal leaflet anatomy and motion, with mitral valve regurgitation attributable mainly to annular dilatation with or without papillary muscle displacement. It is not intended to treat structural defects/degeneration of the mitral valve. The VenTouch System is used to reshape the base of the heart to bring the mitral valve leaflets into better coaptation. By doing so, it brings the mitral valve leaflets closer, allowing proper closure of the valve, and reducing or eliminating MR. There is provision of support to the ventricular myocardium below the annulus as well as the annulus, so the VenTouch System may allow long-term ventricular remodeling with positive impact on the functionality of the mitral valve.</description>

             least 30 days. Subjects must be receiving a beta blocker for 3 months and an ACE-I or&#xD;
             ARB for one month unless, in the investigator's opinion, the subject is intolerant to&#xD;

             for one month prior to study entry. Stable is defined as no more than a 100% increase&#xD;
