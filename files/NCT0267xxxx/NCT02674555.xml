    <textblock>
      This is a study to investigate the absorption, metabolism and excretion of [14C] labeled&#xD;
      ASP8273 in subjects with solid tumors harboring EGFR mutations (per local testing). This&#xD;
      study consists of two parts (A and B).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study consists of two parts (A and B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part A, eligible subjects will be admitted to the site on day -1 and remain confined at&#xD;
      the site until postdosing discharge criteria are met. Subjects will receive a single dose of&#xD;
      [14C] ASP8273 solution on study day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once Part A has been completed, subjects may elect to continue participation in Part B.&#xD;
      Subjects will receive oral administration of ASP8273 (nonradiolabeled) once daily in 28-day&#xD;
      cycles.&#xD;
