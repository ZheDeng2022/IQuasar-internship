    <textblock>
      The present study is intended to supplement the preschool anemic children with vitamin A&#xD;
      capsule and de-hookworm administration in poverty Sichuan province. We eventually expect our&#xD;
      study can provide a cost-effective, safe and more beneficial public health strategy to manage&#xD;
      the anemia status of preschool children in poverty area.&#xD;

      Subjects and ethical approval This randomized, control and double-blinded cohort study was&#xD;
      performed in Dayi, Pixian and Meishan country, Sichuan Province, western China, which are&#xD;
      suburbs of Chengdu city with a low class of socioeconomic status, from March 2012 to&#xD;
      September 2014 and approximately about 216 anemic preschool children aged 3-6 years were&#xD;
      randomly recruited from nine kindergartens of the three countries for the study during&#xD;
      intervention period. The eligibility criteria for participation were as follows: 1) apparent&#xD;
      health; 2) Hb concentration &lt;110 g/l but not &lt;80 g/l; 3) C-reaction protein (CRP) &lt;10 mg/L;&#xD;
      4) parental or guardian approval of participation in all aspects of the study; and 5)&#xD;
      parental/guardian agreement to avoid the additional use of vitamin and mineral supplements&#xD;
      and de-hookworm administration during the trial. Children with Hb&lt;80 g/l and /or CRP &gt;10 mg/l&#xD;
      were sent to hospital with special treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We conducted a census in each regional kindergarten to determine which households included an&#xD;
      eligibility preschool children. Then field health workers conducted a family survey to&#xD;
      determine which children was included. Eligible families were visited by a field worker who&#xD;
      explained the protocol, answered questions, and obtained written informed consent from&#xD;
      parents/guardians. The enrollment and research plan were reviewed and approved by the&#xD;
      institutional ethics committee of the Chengdu Women's and Children's Central Hospital of&#xD;
      Chongqing Medical University in Sichuan province, China. The present study complied with the&#xD;
      code of ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective for the present study was to measure the change in serum Hb before and&#xD;
      after intervention. A sample size of about 60 anemic preschool children per group was&#xD;
      required to detect an absolute difference of 10 g/L of Hb concentration among three&#xD;
      intervention groups after supplementation with 95% power and α= 0.05 for a two-sided&#xD;
      two-sample t-test. To allow for 20% rate of dropout over the duration of the study, we&#xD;
      initially planed to recruit about 72 anemic children per group (totally 216). We estimated&#xD;
      that the prevalence of anemia of preschool children in locality was about 16%[17], eventually&#xD;
      about 1350 children were recruited into an initial Hb screening study before intervention and&#xD;
      about 450 for each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention All eligible anemic children were randomly divided into three groups: Group 1&#xD;
      was received no intervention as control group; Group 2 was received 400 mg single-dose&#xD;
      albendazole administration and Group 3 was received a 200,000 IU vitamin A capsule combined&#xD;
      400 mg single-dose albendazole once initially. For ethical reason, all of the children in&#xD;
      control group were given a single-dose albendazole at the end of study. Immediately after&#xD;
      recruitment, children in one class were assigned a study number that had been previously&#xD;
      randomly assigned to the intervention or control group with fixed, equal allocation to each&#xD;
      group prepared by a third party. The RAND function of Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA) was&#xD;
      used to generate computer randomly permutated codes. The physicians, nurses, field health&#xD;
      workers, parents, children and laboratory personnel were blinded to the treatment assignment&#xD;
      of each child throughout the study period. The data manager, statistician, and all&#xD;
      investigators remained blinded to group assignments until the end of data analysis. The total&#xD;
      duration of intervention and evaluation were six months. Vitamin A capsule and albendazole&#xD;
      tablet were provided by Sichuan Pearl Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compliance Compliance of albendazole tablet and vitamin A capsule were monitored using&#xD;
      recording tables, in which teachers recorded whether the child consumed &quot;all&quot; or &quot;none&quot; of&#xD;
      the albendazole tablet and vitamin A capsule. To avoid exchange of albendazole tablet and&#xD;
      vitamin A capsule by classmates, the three groups were physically separated by being moved to&#xD;
      opposite corners of the classroom. Distribution and consumption of the albendazole tablet and&#xD;
      vitamin A capsule took place under close supervision; children in group 2 and group 3 were&#xD;
      not allowed to leave the classroom or return to their original seats before they had finished&#xD;
      eating their albendazole tablet and vitamin A capsule. The distribution of tablets was&#xD;
      performed by nursery managers, but not health care workers and nursery teachers. Information&#xD;
      on the acceptability of the albendazole tablet and vitamin A capsule was obtained by a short&#xD;
      questionnaire after administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire interview A 30-minute questionnaire was conducted by a trained interviewer&#xD;
      after recruitment. The questionnaire included questions on demographic information&#xD;
      (children's age, sex), educational levels of main caregivers ( who were at least responsible&#xD;
      for the half of care time of children), monthly family income, use of vitamin/mineral&#xD;
      supplement before trial and food frequency recall (the frequency of deep-colored vegetables&#xD;
      and milk, liver and egg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric measurements Anthropometric examinations were conducted by the same trained&#xD;
      anthropometric nurse at baseline and follow-up (6-mo) time points using standardized&#xD;
      techniques to eliminate intra-examiner error. Duplicate measurements were performed for all&#xD;
      children. The inter-examiner coefficient of variation of weight and height for each examiner&#xD;
      in each group was less than 5%. Weight was recorded using a weighing scale (100Med, Beijing,&#xD;
      China) to the nearest 100 g with subjects in minimal clothing and bare feet. Similarly,&#xD;
      height was measured in the standard position by a height scale (Haode, Guangzhou, China) to&#xD;
      the nearest 0.1 cm. By using reference data from World Health Organization (WHO; 2005), the&#xD;
      Z-scores were calculated for height for age (HAZ), weight for height (WHZ), and weight for&#xD;
      age (WAZ). All indices were computed using Anthro (2005) for the personal computer, as&#xD;
      recommended by the WHO (http://www.who.int/childgrowth/software/en/).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sample collection and biochemical assessment At the beginning and at 3 and 6 month&#xD;
      after intervention, three blood samples (about 1 mL) were collected by venipuncture of an&#xD;
      antecubital vein from each subject before breakfast in hospital. A quarter of a milliliter&#xD;
      was drawn into a container containing heparin to measure Hb by the hemoglobincyanide method&#xD;
      (Maker, Chengdu, China). The interassay variation was lower than 5% and the intra-assay&#xD;
      variation was lower than 10%. The blood samples were immediately stored at 4° C to prevent&#xD;
      micro-hemolysis and were separated within 5 h. The remaining blood was centrifuged at 3000g&#xD;
      for 5 min at room temperature. The centrifuged serum samples were divided into aliquots and&#xD;
      immediately transported to the laboratory and stored at -20°C. The concentrations of serum&#xD;
      ferritin (SF) were measured using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)&#xD;
      (Sunbiote, Shanghai, China). Serum soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) was measured by&#xD;
      microparticle-enhanced immunoassay (Sunbiote, Shanghai, China). CRP was measured by&#xD;
      particle-enhanced immunoturbidimetry (Sunbiote, Shanghai, China). Serum retinol concentration&#xD;
      was determined by using high-performance liquid chromatography. Serum retinol was measured by&#xD;
      experienced examiners in the Pediatric Laboratory of Chongqing Medical University and the&#xD;
      other biochemical indices in Clinical Laboratory Center of Chengdu Women &amp; Children's Central&#xD;
      Hospital.&#xD;
