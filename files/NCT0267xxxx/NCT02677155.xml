  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the most common subtype of indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and is&#xD;
      often diagnosed in advanced incurable stage. In our previous trail, Lymvac-1, patients were&#xD;
      treated with sequential intratumoral injections of low-dose rituximab and autologous&#xD;
      dendritic cells, combined with local radiotherapy at the same site. The aim was to overcome&#xD;
      tumor tolerance. In this trial, clinical responses correlated strongly with systemic&#xD;
      anti-tumor CD8+ T-cell responses detected in blood after therapy. The primary aim of the&#xD;
      planned study (Lymvac-2) is to significantly improve rates of immunological and clinical&#xD;
      responses by adding iv anti-PD-1 antibody (Pembrolizumab) relative to the cohort of patients&#xD;
      previously treated with intranodal immunotherapy without Pembrolizumab (Lymvac-1). The study&#xD;
      includes 10 patients with untreated or relapsed FL.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with advanced stage follicular lymphoma, untreated and relapsed are eligible for&#xD;
      this study. Staging includes PET/CT, CT and bone marrow specimens. Lymphoma nodes must be&#xD;
      available for surgical biopsy, radiation and intranodal treatment. Additionally, there must&#xD;
      be evaluable lesions for measuring systemic effects. The patient undergo leukapheresis for&#xD;
      collection of monocytes then cultured ex vivo to obtain immature dendritic cells (DC). The&#xD;
      treatment targets single lymphoma nodes with radiation (single fraction of 8 Gy),&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided injections of autologous DCs , low-dose rituximab (5 mg) and GM-CSF sc.&#xD;
      This sequential intranodal immunotherapy (SIIT) is repeated three times, targeting different&#xD;
      lymphoma nodes. Anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody (Pembrolizumab) is given iv at each cycle of&#xD;
      SIIT and then every third week for a total of 11 cycles. Patients are evaluated for clinical&#xD;
      response with PET/CT, CT and bone marrow analysis. CD8 and CD4 T cell responses against&#xD;
      autologous tumor cells are measured in blood after treatment by flow cytometry. The primary&#xD;
      aims are to induce systemic clinical responses and correlated T cell responses which may&#xD;
      prolong time to next standard therapy.&#xD;
