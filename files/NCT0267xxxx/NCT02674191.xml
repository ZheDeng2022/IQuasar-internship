    <textblock>
      Treating hyperdivergent malocclusion accompanied by open bite could be challenging and may be&#xD;
      done by several methods as high pull headgear and posterior bite planes or surgically by&#xD;
      maxillary impaction in adults. Nowadays it's the skeletal anchorage system (SAS) era as&#xD;
      mini-screws and mini-plates ,hence we are aiming for absolute anchorage, and could minimize&#xD;
      patient cooperation and the need for surgical treatment.&#xD;

      Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Treatment group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical History Questionnaire: will be filled by the patient to exclude the presence of any&#xD;
      systemic condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Examination:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral structures will be examined by (M. N.) including Teeth for caries, fracture or missing&#xD;
      teeth and gingival tissues for gingivitis, periodontitis, attachment loss, gingival&#xD;
      recession, oral lesions and the nature of the gingival biotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The thorough intraoral examination is needed to evaluate the need for referral for&#xD;
      consultation or intervention before the initiation of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis: (M. B.) will check the patient to fulfill the previously mentioned inclusion&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Full set of records will be taken for every patient as part of the routine procedure for&#xD;
      treatment of patients in the outpatient clinic of the Orthodontic Department, Cairo&#xD;
      University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical procedures are to be performed according to the protocol applied by Sherwood et&#xD;
      al&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients will be referred for the uptake of a Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT),&#xD;
           which is considered as (T1). CBCT scanning will be performed with patients in maximum&#xD;
           dental intercuspation with the next generation i-CAT CBCT unit according to the&#xD;
           manufacture instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
           During scanning, the patient position will be standardized as follows; the Frankfort&#xD;
           horizontal plane is parallel to the floor and mid sagittal plane is perpendicular to the&#xD;
           Frankfort horizontal plane.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Banding of the upper first molars will be done followed by taking an upper impression&#xD;
           with the molar bands in place.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A Transpalatal arch (TPA) will be fabricated from 0.9 mm wire and cemented in the upper&#xD;
           arch. Bonding of the posterior segment with 3M brackets with MBT prescription 0.022&quot;&#xD;
           slot bracket system will be performed. Passive arch of 0.019Ã—0.025&quot; stainless steel arch&#xD;
           wire will be placed in the posterior segment bilaterally&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Surgical procedures will be performed by (H. A.) and will include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Application of topical anesthesia, ULTRACARE benzocaine 20%, at the local anesthesia&#xD;
           injection sites. Administration of local anesthesia, Mepivacaine-l. The injection will&#xD;
           be infiltrated into the area where the miniplate will be fixed bilaterally. Proper&#xD;
           disinfection will be performed with a local disinfectant, BETADINE povidone-iodine 10%,&#xD;
           at the area. Surgery begins with a 1- to 2-cm vestibular incision and a full-thickness&#xD;
           mucoperiosteal flap reflected to expose the cortical bone of the maxillary strut by&#xD;
           blade no. 15 mounted on Bard Parker handle no.3. Two long Y or I shaped mini plates will&#xD;
           be placed bilaterally at the zygomatic buttress area under local anesthesia. The mini&#xD;
           plates will be adapted to fit the contour the underlying bone and adjusted to have their&#xD;
           terminal part at the upper first molar area. Drilling is done using compatible sized&#xD;
           drills mounted on low-speed air motor to create three holes at the sites of the mini&#xD;
           screws that will be inserted for fixation of the mini plates.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The mini plates will be fixed by three mini screws (diameter of 2 mm and 10 mm length)&#xD;
           made of titanium. In case of loose mini screws upon tapping, emergency screws will be&#xD;
           used instead of the loose ones (wider diameter so will enhance the interlocking with&#xD;
           bone).&#xD;
&#xD;
           After placement of the right and left miniplates, the flap was closed using black silk&#xD;
           (3/0) continuous sutures leaving the extensions of the plates perforating the attached&#xD;
           gingiva near the mucogingival junction.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Postoperative instructions will be given to the patients, ice packs, a soft diet is&#xD;
           advised. Postoperative antibiotic (150g Clindamycin/tds) for 1 week, as well as an&#xD;
           analgesic (Cataflam 25mg), are prescribed post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Strict Oral hygiene instructions will be given to the patients and they will be recalled&#xD;
           1 week after the procedure to ensure adequate soft tissue healing. Sutures are removed&#xD;
           one week after the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Closed coil spring insertion:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Loading of the mini plates was done three weeks after surgery to allow giving sufficient&#xD;
           time for soft tissue healing. An intrusion force of (200-300) gm. produced by stretched&#xD;
           closed coil spring will be applied and measured by a force gauge .&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Follow up period:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The patient will be asked to attend follow-up visits every 4 weeks to check the&#xD;
           following: by (M. B., F.H., and M. N.) The stability of the mini plates The integrity of&#xD;
           the appliances The activity of the appliance The amount of correction achieved Any&#xD;
           inflammation related to the appliance or the mini plates&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Appliance activation: The appliance will be activated every 4 weeks by (M. N.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. The patients of both groups were asked to mark their degree of pain on a (VAS) visual&#xD;
           analogue scale regarding their experience with the treatment phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Termination and intervention: (The end point)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Reaching adequate overbite and inter-labial gap or 6 month from the start of&#xD;
                intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patient request&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Poor oral hygiene&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Abnormal side effects or severe inflammation&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Post-intrusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
           A second records image will be ordered with the same criteria and parameters as&#xD;
           previously mentioned. It is recorded as T2.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Patients are going to continue treatment for existing malocclusion and for final&#xD;
           detailing of occlusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for modifying the allocated intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of prolonged swelling and/or pain related to the mini plates, the patient might wait&#xD;
      for more than three weeks before coil spring insertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of loose or broken mini plates, surgical intervention may be required for replacement&#xD;
      of the mini plates and the treatment can be resumed after total resolution of the&#xD;
      inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adherence:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be asked to attend regular follow-up visits and their adherence to the&#xD;
      appointments will be regularly monitored. Reminder calls or messages will be utilized to&#xD;
      improve adherence. The patient adherence to intervention instructions will be monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the participants will be included in an intention to treat analysis, regardless of&#xD;
      adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Control group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects should be fulfilling the previously mentioned inclusion criteria and should sign&#xD;
      the informed consent of agreement to be recruited in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the randomization sheet (done by E.M.), the patients allocated to the control&#xD;
      group will be immediately referred for the uptake of a CBCT, which will be considered (T1)&#xD;
      without any treatment procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A &quot;no treatment&quot; phase of 6 months will be carried out through which the patients will be&#xD;
      followed up to monitor any factor that might have occurred to exclude the patient from the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another CBCT image will be taken after 6 months (T2), T2 images are to be considered the&#xD;
      initial diagnostic images for the patient. The patients will then assessed and treatment will&#xD;
      be provided for each patient as required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adherence:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be asked to attend regular follow-up visits in which full intra oral and&#xD;
      extra oral examination will be performed (E.M.and M.N). Referral of the patient for&#xD;
      restorative and/or periodontal therapy may be done with the needs of each case. The patients'&#xD;
      adherence to the appointments will be regularly monitored. Reminder calls or messages will be&#xD;
      utilized to improve adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      . Patients in the control group are going to start treatment for their existing malocclusion&#xD;
      by (M. N)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant timeline:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be requested to visit the institutional clinic doing the required&#xD;
      adjustments during the preparatory phase&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will then be scheduled to attend on the day of surgery, 1 week, 2 and 3 weeks&#xD;
      after the surgery. They will also be requested for immediate show up in cases of emergency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During posterior segment intrusion, the patients will be scheduled to attend every 3-4 weeks&#xD;
      for appliance activation and monitoring the treatment progress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group patients will be requested to visit the clinic every 4 weeks for follow up&#xD;
      and improvement of the patients' adherence.&#xD;
