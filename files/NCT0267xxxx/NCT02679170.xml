    <measure>ORR (Objective Response Rate)_ALK substudy</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants with objective response based assessment of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST).&#xD;
CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions and non-target disease, with the exception of nodal disease. All nodes, both target and non-target, must decrease to normal (short axis &lt;10 mm). No new lesions. PR was defined as &gt;=30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target lesions. The short aixs was used in the sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter was used in the sum for all other target lesions. No unequivocal progression of non-target disease. No new lesions.</description>

    <measure>Duration of Response (DR)_ALK substudy</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Time in weeks/months from the first documentation of objective tumor response to objective tumor progression or death due to any cancer. Duration of tumor response was calculated as (the date of the first documentation of objective tumor progression or death due to cancer minus the date of the first CR or PR [which ever occurred first] that was subsequently confirmed plus 1) divided by 7 (or 30.44 if in months). DR was calculated for the subgroup of participants with a confirmed objective tumor response. DR is usually categorized by the median with its 95% Confidence Interval (CI), range and 25% and 75% percentiles.</description>

    <description>Adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. Seriousness of an AE was assessed under the criteria of serious adverse event (SAE). An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly.</description>
