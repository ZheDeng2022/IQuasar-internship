      The spinal nerve injury in humans often results in neuropathic pain characterized by&#xD;
      spontaneous burning pain accompanied by allodynia and hyperalgesia. In this sense,&#xD;
      lomboisquiatalgia is a neuropathy that is characterized by narrowing the intervertebral&#xD;
      foramen of the lumbar vertebrae, leading a lumbar chronic pain which irradiate to a lower&#xD;
      limb, being a clinical condition of difficult treatment. Neural Mobilization is a noninvasive&#xD;
      technique used by physiotherapists. The technique aims to restore mobility and elasticity of&#xD;
      the peripheral nervous system by tenses which are imposed on the roots, nerves, spinal cord&#xD;
      and their respective meninges. This technique has been standardized in basic research and has&#xD;
      shown promising results. However, clinically, this technique lacks randomized, controlled and&#xD;
      double blind studies. Therefore, the investigators have to evaluate the effects of Neural&#xD;
      Mobilization technique in patients with lomboisquiatalgia. In this study the investigators&#xD;
      will treat patients three times a week, with ten minute treatment time per session, with 25&#xD;
      oscillations per minute for ten sessions. Many tools will be used to assess the effects of&#xD;
      the protocol applied, for example: evaluation sheet, visual analogue scale (VAS), quality of&#xD;
      life assessment - WHOQOL-bref questionnaire of Roland Morris disability, oswestry index on&#xD;
      disability (version 2.0), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for the measurement of cytokines&#xD;
      in the blood tissue. In this way, the investigators can contribute and understand the&#xD;
      mechanisms involved in the rehabilitation process.&#xD;

      Translational study of the effects of Neural Mobilization in patients with lomboisquiatalgia&#xD;
&#xD;
      The spinal nerve injury in humans often results in neuropathic pain characterized by&#xD;
      spontaneous burning pain accompanied by allodynia and hyperalgesia [1]. These signs and&#xD;
      symptoms occur in the continuous presence of ectopic focus of the afferent peripheral nervous&#xD;
      system (peripheral sensitization) to the central nervous system (CNS) (central&#xD;
      sensitization). After the traumatic experience both peripheral sensitization and central&#xD;
      sensitization contributes to the appearance of poorly adaptive responses in the spinal cord&#xD;
      as well as in the brain, contributing to chronicity and maintenance of neuropathic pain [2,&#xD;
      3]. The pain-induced neuropathy is currently being associated with the involvement of glial&#xD;
      cells located in the spinal cord [4, 5]. Glial cells synthesize several substances, many of&#xD;
      which are also released by nociceptive neurons that modulate the pain response, among which&#xD;
      we can mention prostaglandins, glutamate, arachidonic acid, nitric oxide and cytokines pro&#xD;
      inflammatory [6-9]. Pro-inflammatory cytokines appear to be involved in hyperalgesia and&#xD;
      mechanical allodynia arising from nerve injury due to compression. Many studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated that in models of peripheral nerve trunks ischemia, in rats, occurs an increase&#xD;
      in pro-inflammatory cytokines that may be related to myelin damage and edema [10, 11].&#xD;
      Furthermore, studies using nerve compression model, increased identified interleukins (IL-6&#xD;
      or TNF) in rats with allodynia [12]. In this sense, the interleukins (IL) are proteins&#xD;
      produced by T groups and many of these cells are involved in IL activation of lymphocytes,&#xD;
      each of which has its effect on IL specific groups of cells expressing specific receptors&#xD;
      which are identified by numbers: IL-1, IL4, IL-6, IL-10 [13]. Kraychete et. al. (2009),&#xD;
      analyzed by means of blood samples the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the plasma of&#xD;
      patients with and without neuropathic pain, and found that patients with neuropathies had&#xD;
      higher levels of these cytokines [14]. Kukkar et. al. (2012), a model of neuropathic pain&#xD;
      (CCI) observed an increase of TNF-α level in the sciatic nerve after treatment with aliskiren&#xD;
      (an anti-hipertensive drug) and a decrease in TNF-α with consequent improvement in&#xD;
      nociception [15].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In clinical practice, has been extensively reported that neuropathic pain is difficult to&#xD;
      treat due to inadequate understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in&#xD;
      the development and maintenance of this kind of pain [16, 17]. The therapeutic options for&#xD;
      the control of neuropathic pain have increased in recent years [18]. However, responses to&#xD;
      treatments is still not satisfactory. The neurosurgical treatments include pharmacological&#xD;
      treatments, such as antidepressants, anticonvulsants, gabapentin, carbamazepine, systemic&#xD;
      administration of local anesthetics, topical agents, narcotic analgesics and non-narcotic&#xD;
      antiarrhythmics [17, 18]. Still, as a complementary non-invasive and non-pharmacological&#xD;
      treatment, we find in the literature, the use of therapeutic resources for rehabilitation,&#xD;
      depending on the kinf of injury. In this context, Neural Mobilization techniques have shown&#xD;
      excellent prognosis in patients with differents kind of pain, besides other advantages, such&#xD;
      as low operating cost, easy to use and no adverse effects [19]. Neural Mobilization is a&#xD;
      noninvasive technique used by physiotherapists, this technique aims is, to restore mobility&#xD;
      and elasticity of the peripheral nervous system by strains imposed on nerve trunks, roots,&#xD;
      nerves, spinal cord and their wraps, the meninges due to the imposition of movements and&#xD;
      joint angles [20].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the technique has been used as a method of evaluation and treatment of several&#xD;
      diseases that affect the central nervous system (such as Stroke) or peripheral (herniated&#xD;
      discs or nerve impingement) and structures such as, the muscles due to the existing&#xD;
      integration between the musculoskeletal system and the nervous system [19, 21-23]. The&#xD;
      healthy relationship, away from injuries, between peripheral nerves and locomotor system with&#xD;
      respect to their tissue interfaces allows individuals to move from free and without pain&#xD;
      [24]. Research by Dworkin et al., (2007) points out that the Neural mobilization is effective&#xD;
      in conditions of musculoskeletal injuries to functional and pathological diagnosis [21].&#xD;
      However, the authors mention that for each musculoskeletal condition a kind of neural&#xD;
      mobilization should be performed. Also depending on the clinical condition of the patient&#xD;
      other therapies may be included in treatment plan. Our group has been studying last six&#xD;
      years, and standardizing the technique Neural Mobilization (MOB) in rats. Encouraging results&#xD;
      were found using our treatment protocol. We demonstrated that the MOB reduced nociceptive&#xD;
      frame, through the involvement of opioid receptors in the central nervous system (PAG) and&#xD;
      peripheral (DRG), involvement of substance P, TRPV 1, NGF, PO (protein zero), intense&#xD;
      regeneration process in sciatic nerve and, exponential increase in muscle strength&#xD;
      [25-28,34]. Thus, we believe that Neural Mobilization technique, through basic research,&#xD;
      appears to be effective in the antinociceptive process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPECTED RESULTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Is consensus that therapeutic alternatives for the treatment of neuropathic pain are needed.&#xD;
      Physical therapy has been shown by Neural Mobilization technique is efetive in pain control.&#xD;
      This project becomes important because of the lack of consistent controlled, randomized and&#xD;
      double blind, demonstrating the benefits effect of Neural Mobilization technique in patients&#xD;
      with neuropathic pain. The lomboisquiatalgia is characterized by narrowing of the&#xD;
      intervertebral foramen of the lumbar vertebrae and spinal nerve projection site. It is a&#xD;
      clinical complication difficult to diagnose and very easy to be confused with herniated disc,&#xD;
      piriformis syndrome or even osteoarthritis disc. The isquiatalgia is induced by nerve root&#xD;
      compression (local projection roots which form the sciatic nerve between L3 and L4 and L5 and&#xD;
      S1), most often caused by a protrusion of nucleus pulposus by virtue of disruption of the&#xD;
      fibrous rings symphysis intervertebral [30]. Neural mobilization technique is able to induces&#xD;
      an antinociceptive effect in model of cronic pain, reason it is an important clinical tool in&#xD;
      the treatment of patients with neuropathic pain [28, 20, 31]. Thus, we believe that we need&#xD;
      to perform, randomize, control the frequently sessions and time of treatment to bring from&#xD;
      basic research to now to the clinic in order to better understand the mechanism involved in&#xD;
      this kind of pain. In this way, we can contribute effectively and understand the mechanisms&#xD;
      involved in the rehabilitation process of these patients, correlating with improvement in&#xD;
      pain and consequent improvement of life of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AINS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate the effects of Neural Mobilization technique on the quality of life, biochemical&#xD;
      changes in patients with lomboisquiatalgia using:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Check the immediate effect of neural mobilization technique on pain of patients with&#xD;
           lomboisquiatalgia through pain scale;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Check and analysis if Neural mobilization technique increase the functional of patients&#xD;
           with lomboisquiatalgia;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examine the impact of treatment with Neural Mobilization in pro- and anti inflammatory&#xD;
           citokynes (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, TNFa and fractalquina) through the analysis of patients&#xD;
           blood tissue;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Check possible adverse effects of Neural Mobilization technique in patients with&#xD;
           lomboisquiatalgia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL CHALLENGES AND THE MEANS AND METHODS TO OVERCOME THEM&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study and ethics of design: will be a randomized, controlled, double-blind, in&#xD;
           accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki, as approved by the&#xD;
           Ethics Committee in Research with Human Subjects at the University Nove , São Paulo, SP,&#xD;
           Brazil (2 44079115.1.1001.5511).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants: Subjects will be recruited from the Integrated Health Clinic at the&#xD;
           University Nove in Sao Paulo / SP, even through phone contact, e-mail and letters to&#xD;
           orthopedic doctors, clinicians and neurologists. Potentially eligible subjects will be&#xD;
           invited for an interview and a screening procedure performed by a physiotherapist. After&#xD;
           eligibility, subjects will sign the Term of Free and Clear (TCLE), according to&#xD;
           Resolution 196/96 of the National Health Council, confirming the participation in the&#xD;
           survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Calculation of the sample: The sample size was calculated based on the Analog Scale&#xD;
           pain, which was considered the primary end point. To this end, the variance reported in&#xD;
           a study by Murphy et al., 2006, whose objective was to evaluate the Neural mobilization&#xD;
           as a technique for the treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis. Considering the mean and&#xD;
           standard deviation of the pre- intervention and post-intervention this study, with an&#xD;
           alpha value ( α ) of 0.05 and 90% power test, it was determined that 40 subjects were&#xD;
           required , It is 20 for each experimental group and 20 for each control group [32].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visual Analogue Scale: The primary outcome of interest will be assessed by Visual&#xD;
           Analogue Scale (VAS). The VAS is to assist in the assessment of pain intensity in the&#xD;
           participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaire WHOQOL-BREF: The WHOQOL-bref questionnaire is a specific questionnaire,&#xD;
           short and quick application, developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) in order&#xD;
           to standardize the assessment of quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disability Questionnaire Roland Morris - RMDQ: Roland and Morris developed in 1983 a&#xD;
           questionnaire to assess functional disability of patients with low back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oswestry Disability Index (ODQ - version 2.0): The Oswestry disability Index (Oswestry&#xD;
           Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire (ODQ) aims to assess dysfunction in individuals&#xD;
           with low back pain by analyzing the activities of daily living.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for the measurement of cytokines: To assess the&#xD;
           impact of Neural Mobilization technical front of interleukin pro- and anti-inflammatory&#xD;
           collecting blood tissue will be necessary (for blood collection will follow the manual&#xD;
           techniques for collection ministry of Health of the blood [33] of each patient to the&#xD;
           enzyme immunoassays for each specific cytokine). Will be made two blood collections, the&#xD;
           original measure (the first session) and after the last session (tenth session)&#xD;
           treatment. The blood tissue will initially be stored after collection and centrifuged&#xD;
           for 20 minutes at 3000 rpm. For dosage fractalkine, cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-10 and&#xD;
           TNF-α) specific reagents will be used in Milliplex®TM Map Kit (Millipore Corporation,&#xD;
           Darmstadt- Germany) according to the protocol specified by the manufacturer.&#xD;
