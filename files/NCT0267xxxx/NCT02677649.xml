    <textblock>
      Composition and diversity of intestinal microbiota that are subject to the influence of diet&#xD;
      have a significant impact on health in the gut and whole body via complex interactions&#xD;
      between food constituents, bacteria, and host. Polyphenols are poorly absorbed in the upper&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract and reach the colon, where they may have a reciprocal relationship&#xD;
      with microbiota. Because how polyphenols mediate gut health and reduce risk for other&#xD;
      pathogenesis remains to be elucidated, we propose to conduct a pilot controlled feeding study&#xD;
      to examine the impact of polyphenols and other constituents in the free dried whole cranberry&#xD;
      powder (FWCP) on composition and diversity of gut microbiota, as well as to substantiate&#xD;
      bioavailability of cranberry polyphenols. The central hypothesis underlying the proposed&#xD;
      research is that FWCP polyphenols will diminish the magnitude of a plant food free diet&#xD;
      induced increase in Alistipes, Bilophila and Bacteroides and will increase Enterococcus,&#xD;
      Bifidobacterium, Eggerthella lenta, and Blautia coccoides-Eubacterium rectale groups. The&#xD;
      proposed research is novel as no study has examined the specific impact of FWCP polyphenols&#xD;
      incorporated into a plant food free diet on gut microbiota. This proposed study is innovative&#xD;
      because the positive results will demonstrate with a high degree of confidence that the&#xD;
      impact of FWCP constituents on production of beneficial short chain fatty acids, carcinogenic&#xD;
      bile acids, and atherogenic trimethylamine. The results generated from the study using a&#xD;
      plant food free dietary regimen as the background diet will provide definite proof on&#xD;
      microbial modulating actions of FWCP, inform mechanism of actions in urinary tract infection&#xD;
      (UTI), and be used to formulate messages in consumer communications for gut health.&#xD;

      Investigators propose conducting a randomized, controlled feeding, crossover trial in 10&#xD;
      adults who have a regular bowel movement (≥5 times/wk) and are willing to consume a diet free&#xD;
      of plant foods. The trial will include two 5-d intervention phases with a 2-wk washout period&#xD;
      between crossovers. All meals will be provided to subjects during the intervention phases.&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive either Con or FWCP diet containing 30 gram&#xD;
      matched placebo or FWCP. The dose is selected in order to provide sufficient amounts of&#xD;
      flavonoid and PAC that can be comparable to the average flavonoid and PAC intake at 157 mg&#xD;
      and 95 mg/d, respectively in US. The plant food free diet will be formulated to contain only&#xD;
      animal based ingredients. All meals will be designed and overseen by Helen Rasmussen, PhD,&#xD;
      RD, and be prepared in the kitchen of the Metabolic Research Unit. Packed frozen meals will&#xD;
      be provided to subjects to consume at home or work. Coffee, tea, and other plant-based&#xD;
      beverages will not be allowed during the intervention phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be required to provide their informed consent prior to enrolling in the&#xD;
      study. Individuals will be screened for study eligibility according to the exclusion&#xD;
      criteria, as followed: 1) no antibiotic medications or drugs known to influence fecal&#xD;
      microbiota were taken 3 mo before the study; 2) active treatment for doctor diagnosed&#xD;
      diseases, such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, gastrointestinal diseases; 3) regular use&#xD;
      of any dietary supplements; 4) colonoscopy 2 mo prior to their enrollment or scheduled during&#xD;
      the study; 5) values of standard blood biochemistries are critically abnormal based on study&#xD;
      physician's discretion; and 6) use of ≥14/wk serving of alcohol. Subjects who meet all other&#xD;
      eligibility criteria and have values of blood biochemistries within normal ranges will be&#xD;
      asked to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the trial, eligible subjects will be required to attend 1 screening visit and 9 study&#xD;
      visits over 5-7 wks. At the end of Visits 2 and 6, subjects will receive the randomly&#xD;
      assigned frozen meals and begin consuming the study meals for 5 d. Subjects may consume the&#xD;
      study meals ≥5 da until the post-intervention stool sample is collected. The whole stool&#xD;
      sample will be placed in a sealed bag and then in a cooler with ice packs and transported to&#xD;
      the MRU within 24 h. Morning spot urine and 30 mL fasted blood as well as all other clinical&#xD;
      data will be collected before and after each intervention phase. All collected samples will&#xD;
      be stored at -80 degree C until uses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size of the human trial was estimated based on the effect of FWCP on the plant&#xD;
      food free diet induced increase in bile tolerant bacteria and on the increase in&#xD;
      Enterococcus, Bifidobacterium, Eggerthella lenta, and Blautia coccoides-Eubacterium rectale.&#xD;
      Since there is no data in the literature illustrating the effect of FWCP on bile tolerant&#xD;
      bacteria for power calculation, investigators will employ in the proposed crossover&#xD;
      controlled feeding trial 10 subjects to test our hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fecal DNA will be extracted by enzymatic digestion and bead-beating steps followed by the use&#xD;
      of QIAamp Stool DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen). 16S rRNA gene amplicons will be generated from the&#xD;
      extracted DNA using PCR with a barcoded primer set targeted to the V4 variable region.&#xD;
      Amplicons will be sequenced on an Illumina ® MiSeq Sequencer at the Tufts University Core&#xD;
      Facility which is directed by Dr. Anne Kane. Microbiota Analysis will be performed using&#xD;
      Qiime v 1.7. Operational taxonomic units will be generated using UClust. Alpha and beta&#xD;
      diversity parameters will be calculated using Qiime. Urinary flavonoids and phenolic acids&#xD;
      will be determined by our routine HPLC-electrochemical detection method. Anthocyanins and&#xD;
      their glucuronidate metabolites in urine will be quantified by a LC-MS/MS assay investigators&#xD;
      use routinely. Fecal short chain fatty acids will be determined using a GC-MS method that has&#xD;
      been established in our laboratory. The pH value in the fecal water of the feces will be&#xD;
      determined using a pH meter after centrifugation. Individual bile acids in feces will be&#xD;
      determined using a LC-QTOF-MS method. TMA in feces will be determined using a&#xD;
      spectrophotometric assay.&#xD;
