  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare the difference in daily protein intake of&#xD;
      critically ill patients in two standardized enteral nutrition formulas (20% versus 33%&#xD;
      percent) with the same caloric density of 1.2 kcal/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total amount of protein taken in on day four after starting the early enteral feeding is&#xD;
      defined as primary endpoint.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For years, the Surgical Intensive Care Unit of the University Hospital Basel has used an&#xD;
      early enteral approach for the feeding of critically ill patients with different formulas&#xD;
      that have high protein content (20% of total energy). However, the energy goal in the first&#xD;
      week is only 20 kcal for normal-weight and 12.5 kcal for obese patients, which results in&#xD;
      daily protein amounts of 0.8 to 1 g/kg bodyweight (BW), so that additional protein has to be&#xD;
      administered. Due to a suggestion of the dietetic service of the University Hospital Basel,&#xD;
      Fresenius Kabi produced a whey based enteral feeding formula for intensive care patients.&#xD;
      Specific further adaptations for this patient group included micronutrients and a fatty acid&#xD;
      profile as well as low fibres. Surgical Intensive Care Unit of the University Hospital Basel&#xD;
      now are offered the opportunity to test this formula in clinical practice and hypothesize&#xD;
      that this specific high-protein (30% of energy) enteral formula reaches the same amount of&#xD;
      daily caloric intake with a higher total daily amount of protein and equal intestinal&#xD;
      tolerance compared to a usual intestinal nutritional formula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to test this hypothesis, investigators plan a double-blind, randomized and&#xD;
      controlled study with the aim to achieve a target protein quantity of ≥1.3 g/kg BW with an&#xD;
      energy target of 20kcal/kg BW per day, based on a new, specifically designed formula for&#xD;
      critically ill patients. The amount of protein on day four after starting the early enteral&#xD;
      feeding is defined as primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints are the total amount of calories,&#xD;
      the nitrogen balance on day five as well as side effects like gastric residual content,&#xD;
      diarrhoea and constipation. Inclusion criteria were an expected stay at the ICU of four days&#xD;
      or longer on admission and 18 years of age or older Exclusion criteria consisted of BMI ≤ 18,&#xD;
      pregnancy, intestinal perforation, mechanical intestinal obstruction, terminal state of&#xD;
      consuming disease, severely impaired liver function and noradrenaline ≥0.5µg/kg BW/min.. On&#xD;
      this purpose, 90 critically ill patients will get either of the two enteral feeding products&#xD;
      as described above. In case of the event that an increased protein intake can be obtained by&#xD;
      the protein-rich formula, an additional study will investigate the influence of early&#xD;
      protein-rich nutrition on skeletal muscle wasting with critically ill patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a pre-study investigators will administer the high protein formula to 20 patients to test&#xD;
      tolerance and suitability for the nutritional Targets in question. Tolerance will be defined&#xD;
      by the absence of one of the following clinical symptoms :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reflux&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diarrhoea&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Constipation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nausea&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vomiting&#xD;
