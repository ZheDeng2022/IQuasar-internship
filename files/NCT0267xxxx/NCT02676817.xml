  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to construct and validate an endomicroscopic score correlated with&#xD;
      microscopic inflammation activity in patients with UC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE) is a new endoscopic imaging modality, which&#xD;
      offers the possibility to perform in vivo mucosal microscopic analysis in real time during&#xD;
      endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives : Development and validation of a UC endomicroscopic score, after&#xD;
      correlation between pCLE data and histological data using the Geboes' score as a gold&#xD;
      standard during ulcerative colitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify predictive factors for the response to adalimumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify predictive factors for recurrence in patients with UC in remission (Mayo score&#xD;
           0 or 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety of the pCLE procedure&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Informed consent will be obtained before colonoscopy that includes the known risks and&#xD;
      benefits related to the procedure according to the standard protocol of the physician and&#xD;
      institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A separate informed consent document to participate in the study specific to the approach,&#xD;
      technology will be executed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Operator's training before the beginning of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
           Thirty short pCLE video sequences will be sent to each investigator. Video sequence&#xD;
           contains pCLE images of mucosal inflammation in a patient with UC. For each video the&#xD;
           correlation with histology is known. The investigator will have to recognize the&#xD;
           different pCLE inflammation criteria (Annex 2) and a 90% correct response rate will be&#xD;
           required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Endoscopic procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      MACROSCOPIC examination: colonoscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bowel preparation according to standard protocol was used for colonoscopy. During the&#xD;
      colonoscopy, the rectal and colonic mucosal will be analysed with high resolution white light&#xD;
      (with or without virtual chromoendoscopy). Before pCLE examination and according to current&#xD;
      guidelines, targeted biopsies will be taken in every suspected area of dysplasia for specific&#xD;
      histological examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MICROSCOPIC examination: pCLE (Cellvizio)&#xD;
&#xD;
      pCLE examination will be done after intravenous injection of fluoresceine (2.5 ml), with the&#xD;
      monitoring of cardiovascular and respiratory functions. Three defined area will be analysed:&#xD;
      right colon, left colon (40cm from the anus) and the rectum (10cm). Real time analysis and&#xD;
      re-reading after the colonoscopy will be done for the video sequences recording during the&#xD;
      procedure. A double-blind analysis for each video sequence will be done by two experienced&#xD;
      endoscopists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rectal and colonic biopsies&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each location (right colon, left colon and rectum), 4 macroscopic area will be&#xD;
      indentified (anterior, posterior, left and right), recorded (endoscopic images) and the&#xD;
      mucosal inflammation will be scored according to the Mayo's and UCEIS classifications. Then,&#xD;
      the probe using for the pCLE procedure will be applied on these 4 different areas and video&#xD;
      sequences will be recorded (&quot;optical biopsies&quot;). At the end of the procedure, biopsies will&#xD;
      be taken from each area. Each biopsy will have a registration number and the corresponding&#xD;
      pCLE video sequence will be specified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each location (right colon, left colon, rectum), the final score of inflammation&#xD;
      (macroscopic or microscopic) will be define by the higher score recorded in the 4 areas&#xD;
      (anterior, posterior, left and righ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensibility to change&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the patients with active UC in group 2 (Mayo' sub-score 2 or 3), a rectosigmoidoscopy&#xD;
      should be performed 8 weeks after starting therapy, according to current french guidelines.&#xD;
      In order to compare the pCLE examination before and after adalimumab therapy in the group 2,&#xD;
      each area will be identified with a submucosal injection of Indian ink.&#xD;
