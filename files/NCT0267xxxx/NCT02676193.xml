  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are addressing two critical areas identified by the FDA: the impact of&#xD;
      cigarette packaging and labeling on consumer perceptions and on smoking behavior; and the&#xD;
      effectiveness of graphic warning labels on communicating risk of tobacco products. In a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial (RCT), investigators will enroll committed smokers who have no&#xD;
      intention of quitting in the next 6-months. The three study arms will be: a) a blank pack&#xD;
      with all marketing materials removed (PP); b) The Australian graphic warning images&#xD;
      (Australian model-AM); or c) a standard pack with all marketing materials unaltered (ST). The&#xD;
      study includes a three month purchasing intervention and continued follow-up through 12&#xD;
      months. Throughout the study interactive text messaging assessments will be used to measure&#xD;
      acute and persistent impact of labeling and marketing on perceptions of tobacco products,&#xD;
      subjective effects of consumption, awareness of tobacco-related harms, tobacco use behavior,&#xD;
      and quitting motivation. At three separate time points, participants will: a) complete a&#xD;
      web-based questionnaire b) provide a saliva sample for cotinine analysis. The rigorous design&#xD;
      and extensive objective measurements are significant innovations on the currently published&#xD;
      research in this field and should lead to significant advances in tobacco regulatory science.&#xD;

      Smokers handle their packs frequently. Product packaging is a crucial medium by which the&#xD;
      tobacco industry communicates product attributes, including reassurances about risk. The&#xD;
      industry uses branded imagery on packs to influence consumer perceptions of their product,&#xD;
      while at the same time the tobacco control community uses health warning labels to&#xD;
      communicate harmful and potentially harmful constituents and risks of tobacco products. The&#xD;
      World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) is a treaty&#xD;
      enacted to ensure that every person is informed of the health consequences and addictive&#xD;
      nature of tobacco consumption. Article 11 of the treaty requires Parties to implement large,&#xD;
      rotating health warnings and urges governments to restrict or prohibit the use of Industry&#xD;
      logos, colors, brand images or promotional information on packaging other than brand names&#xD;
      and product names displayed in a standard color and font style. Study Objective: To conduct a&#xD;
      randomized trial of the effect of cigarette pack design on 450 smokers of popular cigarette&#xD;
      brands aged 21-65, who are committed to continue smoking (no intention to quit in the next&#xD;
      6-months). These committed smokers will be randomized to have their cigarettes packaged in&#xD;
      one of 3 study arms: a) blank pack design with all marketing materials removed (BP), b) blank&#xD;
      pack with a large graphic warning label (AM: Australian model) and c) standard pack with&#xD;
      marketing materials intact (ST: US model).&#xD;
