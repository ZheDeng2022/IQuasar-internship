      Chromosomal abnormalities are a major cause of pregnancy loss. Preimplantation Genetic&#xD;
      Screening (PGS) using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) allows the effective detection of&#xD;
      these abnormalities and improves clinical outcomes. However even the transfer of a&#xD;
      chromosomally normal embryo does not guarantee successful implantation. Recent research by&#xD;
      Fragouli, et. al. 2015 has demonstrated a strong association between mitochondrial DNA&#xD;
      quantities (also known as MitoGradeTM) and implantation outcomes in embryos that are already&#xD;
      classified by PGS as chromosomally normal. Investigators have also demonstrated in a clinical&#xD;
      study that MitoGradeTM normal and PGS normal embryos have higher chances of implantation than&#xD;
      MitoGrade elevated PGS normal embryos. Transferring MitoGrade elevated PGS normal embryos&#xD;
      results in less than 10% implantation rates while MitoGrade normal PGS normal embryos&#xD;
      resulted in more than 65% implantation rates. The risk of miscarriage after replacing either&#xD;
      type is very low (about 8%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to understand the complete effectiveness of the test, investigators are conducting a&#xD;
      paired prospective study. This means that investigators will be transferring a MitoGrade&#xD;
      normal and a MitoGrade elevated embryo at the same time to see if one implants better than&#xD;
      the other. It is expected that patients joining this study will benefit from knowing that at&#xD;
      least one embryo is MitoGrade normal PGS normal.&#xD;

      Mitochondria are considered the powerhouses of cells. These membrane-bound organelles play a&#xD;
      vital role in embryonic development and are essential for various cellular functions. And&#xD;
      unlike other cellular organelles, they contain their own DNA (also known as mitochondrial DNA&#xD;
      or mtDNA). Embryonic development is a complex energy-driven process and is thought to be&#xD;
      highly dependent on mitochondrial function and mtDNA gene expression. It is believed that&#xD;
      amounts of mtDNA remain constant in first three days of preimplantation development.&#xD;
      Significant alterations in mtDNA are not initiated until after day 5 when the embryo has&#xD;
      undergone the first cellular differentiation into trophectoderm (TE) and inner cell mass. It&#xD;
      is possible that mtDNA variation may account chromosomal abnormalities by affecting the&#xD;
      accuracy of chromosome segregation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to describing the relationship between mtDNA expression and clinical outcomes,&#xD;
      Reprogenetics and Fragouli et al. (2015) were able to establish a threshold over which no&#xD;
      clinical pregnancy was established. These results were further validated in a prospective&#xD;
      blinded study and independently validated using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis.&#xD;
      The quantification of mtDNA therefore provides important information in selecting the best&#xD;
      embryos for transfer. MitoGradeTM is a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based method&#xD;
      developed to quantify the amount of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) present in human&#xD;
      preimplantation embryos. It is believed that a chromosomally normal embryo with a MitoGradeTM&#xD;
      score lower than the established threshold will have a higher chance of successful&#xD;
      implantation in comparison to a similar embryo with a higher MitoGradeTM score.&#xD;
