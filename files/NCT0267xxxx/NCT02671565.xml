      Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease in which there is an imbalance between&#xD;
      the breakdown and repair of the joint tissue. Intraarticular hyaluronic acid (HA) injections&#xD;
      are used for the management of knee OA. Currently, there is limited and inconclusive evidence&#xD;
      supporting use of HA injections for management of knee OA. The primary objective of our study&#xD;
      is to evaluate the effectiveness of HA injections in the management of knee OA. Investigators&#xD;
      will evaluate if HA injections prevent or delay knee OA surgical interventions.&#xD;

      Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease in which there is an imbalance between&#xD;
      the breakdown and repair of the joint tissue.Intraarticular hyaluronic acid (HA) injections&#xD;
      are used for the management of knee OA. The pooled estimates of randomized clinical trials in&#xD;
      various meta-analyses do not have consistent conclusions, some conclude no benefit while&#xD;
      others conclude small benefit (reducing the pain or improving the daily functioning) to&#xD;
      overall benefit (alleviating pain as well as improving daily functioning).The variation in&#xD;
      conclusions is due to the heterogeneity in the methodology of the clinical trials included in&#xD;
      these meta-analyses as well as a difference in the interpretation of clinical&#xD;
      findings.Furthermore, most of the trials (63%) evaluating efficacy of HA are industry funded,&#xD;
      raising the concern for publication bias. Furthermore Although the evidence favoring the use&#xD;
      of HA injections is limited, these injections still have a significant market share with an&#xD;
      annual sale of $725 million per year. Given the high dollar amount spent on the intervention,&#xD;
      evaluation of its effectiveness in real world setting is important. Currently, there is&#xD;
      limited and inconclusive evidence supporting use of HA injections for management of knee OA.&#xD;
      The primary objective of the current study is to evaluate the effectiveness of HA injections&#xD;
      in the management of knee OA. Specifically, the investigators will compare the risk of any&#xD;
      surgical intervention of knee as a primary outcome among the knee OA patients who are exposed&#xD;
      to HA injections with those who are not exposed to HA injections (HA non-users) and those who&#xD;
      are exposed to intra-articular corticosteroid (CS) injections. Three separate outcome&#xD;
      definitions, which includes: i) composite surgical outcome measure (includes total knee&#xD;
      replacement, partial knee replacement, arthroscopic procedures, osteotomy and free-floating&#xD;
      inter-positional devices), ii) total and partial knee replacements only and iii) total knee&#xD;
      replacement (TKR) only will be used to compare the effectiveness of HA users with HA&#xD;
      non-users and CS users.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted using knee OA patients aged 40 years and above from the Lifelink&#xD;
      Plus claims data (2006-2015). Knee OA patients with a specialist visit and a recent history&#xD;
      of medications used for pain management (proxy for moderate-severe pain) will be identified.&#xD;
      Patients will be classified into 3 groups: 1) HA users, 2) CS users and 3) HA non-users based&#xD;
      on exposure/non-exposure to these interventions within first 90 days after specialist visit.&#xD;
      HA users will be matched separately with two comparison (CS users and HA non-users) groups&#xD;
      using a propensity score matching approach to reduce the imbalance between the intervention&#xD;
      and comparison group. HA users will be matched separately to each comparison group (1:1&#xD;
      ratio) using a greedy matching approach within a predefined caliper (0.2 of the pooled&#xD;
      standard deviation of the logit of the PS). Cox models will be used to compare the risk of 1)&#xD;
      any surgical interventions for knee, 2) TKR and partial knee replacements only and 3) TKR&#xD;
      only, among HA users and the comparison groups. For both comparisons, investigators will use&#xD;
      four approaches to compare the risk of each outcome measure: 1) Unadjusted bivariate&#xD;
      analysis, 2) Adjusted multivariate analysis, 3) Propensity score-matched sample and 4)&#xD;
      Inverse probability weighting (IPW) using propensity score.&#xD;
