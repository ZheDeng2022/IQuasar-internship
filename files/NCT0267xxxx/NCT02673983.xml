      The aim of this study is to evaluate FTRD (full-thickness resection device) in terms of&#xD;
      obtaining full-thickness biopsies form the gastrointestinal tract endoscopically in the&#xD;
      work-up of patients with gastrointestinal motility disorders.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Functional intestinal disorders are a common problem and diagnosis is a challenge to&#xD;
      clinicians. Several motility disorders are caused by pathological changes in the&#xD;
      neuromuscular network in the intestinal wall. To obtain a diagnosis a full-thickness biopsy&#xD;
      is required. At present, this kind of biopsy is usually obtained by a laparoscopic surgical&#xD;
      procedure, requiring full anesthesia, operating room and several days of postoperative care&#xD;
      in the hospital. Today, there is lacking a more minimal invasive approach for obtaining&#xD;
      full-thickness biopsies from the gastrointestinal tract. A new device has been developed&#xD;
      called full-thickness resection device (FTRD), which has proved useful and safe from removing&#xD;
      polyps in the gastrointestinal tract (Schmidt A Endoscopy 47;8, 719-725). The specific aims&#xD;
      of this study is to determine if FTRD safe for obtaining full-thickness biopsies form the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract and whether these FTRD biopsies be used for clinical diagnosis of&#xD;
      patients with suspected intestinal motility disorders. If these aims can be achieved FTRD&#xD;
      would be of potential great value for patients and health care in the management of patients&#xD;
      with gastrointestinal disorders. 40 patients will be included, i.e. 10 patients will undergo&#xD;
      FTRD biopsy in the sigmoid colon, distal ileum, jejunum and duodenum. Patients will undergo&#xD;
      the biopsy procedure under conscious sedation at the Endoscopy Unit in Malm√∂, Region Skane&#xD;
      and stay one night at the hospital to detect any complications. A venous blood sample will be&#xD;
      taken before and 24 hours after the biopsy for examination of systemic inflammatory changes.&#xD;
      All biopsies will examined by an expert in neuromuscular pathology.&#xD;
