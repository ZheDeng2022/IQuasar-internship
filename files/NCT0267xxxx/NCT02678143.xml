  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the overall safety and feasibility of using&#xD;
      haploidentical or one antigen mismatch unrelated hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT)&#xD;
      for adult patients with severe sickle cell disease (SCD) who undergo a non-myeloablative&#xD;
      preparative regimen consisting of total body irradiation (TBI), cyclophosphamide and&#xD;
      alemtuzumab (and fludarabine for haplo-SCT only) and graft vs. host disease (GvHD)&#xD;
      prophylaxis consisting of post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PT-Cy), mycophenolate mofetil&#xD;
      (MMF), and sirolimus. The investigators anticipate that this approach will expand the donor&#xD;
      pool and offer a safe and less toxic curative intervention.&#xD;

    <description>The recipient of one antigen mismatch unrelated HSCT will begin the preparative regimen on Day -7. Alemtuzumab on Days -7, -6, -5, -4, and -3, cyclophosphamide on Days -4 and -3, and 300 cGy of total body irradiation (TBI) on Day -2.&#xD;
The recipient of haplo-SCT will begin the preparative regimen on Day -7. Alemtuzumab on Days -7, -6, -5, -4, and -3, fludarabine on Days -7, -6, -5, -4, and -3, cyclophosphamide on Days -4 and -3, and 400 cGy of TBI on Day -2.&#xD;
For both types of HSCT, the frozen peripheral blood stem cells will be thawed and infused on Day 0 per institutional guidelines. GVHD prophylaxis will consist of cyclophosphamide on Days +3 and + 4, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) three times a day on Days +5 through +35 then tapered off over 1 week provided there is no evidence of GVHD, and sirolimus starting on Day +5 and continuing for one year. Sirolimus can be tapered at one year only if donor T-cell chimerism reaches more than 50% in the absence of GVHD.</description>
