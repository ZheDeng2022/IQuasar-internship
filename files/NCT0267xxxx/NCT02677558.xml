      INTRODUCTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of obesity is increasing to alarming rates worldwide. The impact of obesity on&#xD;
      cardiovascular health is well documented, but much less is known about the impact of obesity&#xD;
      in pregnancy on maternal cardiac function. The aim of the current study is to investigate how&#xD;
      the cardiovascular system of morbidly obese women adapts to the circulatory changes&#xD;
      associated with pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overweight and obesity is a major threat to global health. In 2013, 36.9% of all men and 38%&#xD;
      of all women worldwide were overweight or obese as defined by a BMI of ≥25 kg/m2 or of ≥30&#xD;
      kg/m2 respectively. According to a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study&#xD;
      2013, South Africa ranks third in a list of the world's most obese nations behind the United&#xD;
      States and Mexico. The prevalence of overweight (BMI ≥25kg/m2) and obesity (BMI ≥30kg/m2)&#xD;
      combined in the age group above 20 years is estimated to be 38.8% for men and 69.3% for women&#xD;
      in South Africa. In the age group below 20 years, it is 18.8% for boys and 26.3% for girls.&#xD;
      42% of women above the age of 20 years and 9.6% of girls below 20 years are considered obese.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact of obesity on the structure and the function of the heart is well documented.&#xD;
      Obesity is strongly associated with risk factors for the development of atherosclerotic&#xD;
      disease such as hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, and diabetes. In addition, there is evidence&#xD;
      that obesity in itself can lead to structural and functional changes in the heart. The&#xD;
      following changes are commonly encountered in obesity:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Left ventricular remodelling: Many studies report that obesity is associated with an&#xD;
           increase in left ventricular mass (LV mass). LV mass is commonly indexed against the&#xD;
           body surface area (BSA). In the setting of significant obesity, LV mass/BSA is often&#xD;
           normal or reduced, because the BSA increases more than the LV mass. Many investigators&#xD;
           therefore choose to index LV mass to lean body mass, height or height raised to the&#xD;
           power of 2.76. Recent studies agree that both wall thickness and cavity size seem to be&#xD;
           increased in obesity, but wall thickness is increased to a greater extent, leading to a&#xD;
           concentric pattern of left ventricular hypertrophy in obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Right ventricular size: Only few studies have looked at the changes in the right&#xD;
           ventricle in obesity. Wong et al. found mild increase in RV cavity size and wall&#xD;
           thickness in uncomplicated obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Left atrial size: Obesity is associated with an increase in left atrial size.&#xD;
           Hypertension, volume overload and diastolic filling abnormalities commonly lead to an&#xD;
           increase in left atrial size. All are commonly present in obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Left ventricular systolic function: Recent studies report that LV ejection fraction is&#xD;
           preserved in obesity or even above normal. There are, however subclinical contractile&#xD;
           abnormalities which can already be found in obese children and adolescents comparable to&#xD;
           those found in adult obese subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Left ventricular diastolic function: The most common finding is that isovolumetric&#xD;
           relaxation time is prolonged in obesity. Reduced tissue doppler velocities have also&#xD;
           been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Right ventricular function: Reduced RV systolic and diastolic function have been&#xD;
           reported in individuals with a BMI ≥35kg/m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is well established that obesity in pregnancy is a associated with an increased risk for&#xD;
      thromboembolism, preeclampsia, postpartum haemorrhage, caesarean section and instrumental&#xD;
      delivery. The impact of obesity during pregnancy might however reach even further. A well&#xD;
      conducted retrospective study published in Hypertension this year found an association&#xD;
      between obesity in pregnancy and premature mortality and morbidity from major cardiovascular&#xD;
      events later in life. It is thought that the cardio-metabolic changes of obese pregnancy&#xD;
      potentially unmask the patients at risk for cardiovascular events later in life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transthoracic echocardiography can detect subclinical alterations in cardiac structure and&#xD;
      function. It is non-invasive and does not bear any risk for the mother or the baby. A routine&#xD;
      assessment of the haemodynamic status in all obese pregnant women therefore has the potential&#xD;
      to establish which women are at increased risk for haemodynamic complications during&#xD;
      pregnancy and/or later in life. However, there have been only a limited number of studies on&#xD;
      the haemodynamic changes in morbidly obese parturients as assessed by transthoracic&#xD;
      echocardiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. We hypothesise that cardiac dysfunction as determined by transthoracic echocardiography&#xD;
           occurs more frequently in morbidly obese pregnant women than in pregnant women with&#xD;
           normal BMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. We hypothesise that the severity of the observed cardiac dysfunction correlates with the&#xD;
           degree of obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To quantify the incidence of systolic and diastolic dysfunction and cardiac structural&#xD;
           abnormalities in obese pregnant women at term.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To quantify the incidence of systolic and diastolic dysfunction and cardiac structural&#xD;
           abnormalities in healthy term pregnant women with a normal BMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To quantify the severity of cardiac dysfunction and remodelling in obese pregnant women&#xD;
           at term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective case control study will be carried out at Groote Schuur Maternity Clinic and&#xD;
      Mowbray Maternity Hospital in Cape Town, South Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Characteristics of study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are aiming to recruit 40 obese pregnant, non-labouring women at term who fulfil the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria. As controls, 40 healthy non-obese non-labouring term pregnant women will&#xD;
      be recruited. Controls will be matched for age and ethnicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients for the study group and the control group will be recruited from the antenatal&#xD;
      clinic and antenatal wards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed Consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written informed consent will be obtained from all participants. Forms will be available in&#xD;
      English and explained to the participants. The interview will be conducted in the&#xD;
      participant's language of choice and a translator will assist with interpretation if&#xD;
      required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After enrolment in the study and informed consent, study patients and controls will undergo&#xD;
      an echocardiographic examination as described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic Data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time point of enrolment, the following data will be recorded for all participants&#xD;
      according to standard care in pregnancy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  gestational age and parity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ethnicity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  height and weight&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  blood pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiographic assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A full standard echocardiographic assessment according to the protocol of the British Society&#xD;
      of Echocardiography14 will be performed by an experienced investigator (passed European&#xD;
      Echocardiography Examination), except subcostal views which are technically not feasible in&#xD;
      pregnant women. In addition, a detailed right heart examination will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The examination will take place in the left lateral position to improve image quality and&#xD;
      prevent obstruction of the inferior vena cava. A GE echocardiography machine will be used.&#xD;
      For each acquisition, 3 cardiac cycles will be stored and analysed offline (after the&#xD;
      examination) with Centricity Electronic Medical Records software developed by GE at a&#xD;
      workstation at the Department of Anaesthesia/Cardiology. All echocardiographic assessments&#xD;
      and offline analysis will be performed by one experienced investigators without blinding.&#xD;
      Thereafter a second experienced investigator will review the images independently offline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection is planned to take place over a duration of 3 months in 2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks and Benefits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transthoracic echocardiography is a non-invasive procedure and safe for both the mother and&#xD;
      the baby. No risk will arise due to participation in the study. The timing of the study will&#xD;
      not interfere with routine clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a cardiac condition is noted during the examination or any of the echocardiographic&#xD;
      findings require a change to the planned care, this will be communicated to the patient's&#xD;
      medical team without delay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in the study will therefore bring an additional clinical benefit to the mother&#xD;
      at no additional risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data handling and Confidentiality:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All demographic data pertaining to a participant will be collected on a standardised form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will be assigned a unique study number. The echocardiography data will be&#xD;
      stored on the GE echocardiography machine using this number only, with no identifying&#xD;
      information. From here the data will be exported to the hospital based echocardiography data&#xD;
      system for analysis (Centricity Electronic Medical Records). The participants are thus&#xD;
      de-linked from their hospital admission numbers and confidentiality is protected. The records&#xD;
      can only be accessed with an assigned login from Groote Schuur hospital that will only be&#xD;
      available to the approved users of the Centricity system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A record of hospital admission numbers will be maintained to correlate echocardiography data&#xD;
      with clinical data and allow the patient's medical team to be informed of any relevant&#xD;
      pathology that may impact patient care. The Principal Investigator will have access to the&#xD;
      record log and this information will not be made available outside the University of Cape&#xD;
      Town.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study records that identify a patient are kept confidential as required by law. Privacy&#xD;
      regulations provide safeguards for privacy, security and authorised access. Except when&#xD;
      required by law, no data will identify the patient in the study records. The data collected&#xD;
      remains the intellectual property of the University of Cape Town.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic and obstetrics data will be displayed as mean and standard deviation, median with&#xD;
      interquartile ranges, or number and percentage as appropriate. Analysis of recorded&#xD;
      transthoracic echocardiography variables and heart rate and blood pressure will be made using&#xD;
      analysis of variance (ANOVA) and a General Linear Model with significant p value defined as &lt;&#xD;
      0.05 after performing F tests on the collected data. Pearson's correlation will be used to&#xD;
      assess the strength of the linear relationship between variables. The null hypothesis will be&#xD;
      rejected if critical p &lt; 0.05 for each of the variables.&#xD;
