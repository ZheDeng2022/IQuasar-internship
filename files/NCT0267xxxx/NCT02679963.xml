  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre randomised double-blind phase II trial, sponsored by Gustave Roussy and&#xD;
      involving one French center as well as the Spanish Lung Cancer Group (≈20 centers of the&#xD;
      SLCG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six hundred patients with diagnosis of stage IIIB/IV NSCLC will initially be registered prior&#xD;
      to receiving the first line platinum-based chemotherapy or during or at the end of the first&#xD;
      6 cycles of inducation platinium based chemotherapy and provide consent for retrieving&#xD;
      archival tissue collection and providing translational blood samples and tumor biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. - Induction chemotherapy phase All patients will initially be treated with 6 cycles of&#xD;
           platinum-based induction chemotherapy. Cycle duration will be 21 days. Doublets should&#xD;
           either consist of a pemetrexed-platinum (cisplatin or carboplatin) doublet&#xD;
           (preferentially for non-squamous NSCLC) or a gemcitabine - or vinorelbine - platinum&#xD;
           doublet for squamous NSCLC. Taxanes-platinum doublets will not be accepted.&#xD;
           Translational blood samples will be taken at the beginning of induction chemotherapy for&#xD;
           all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients displaying progressive disease or stable disease after induction chemotherapy&#xD;
           will be withdrawn and further optimally managed according to local practice. For them,&#xD;
           an optional tumour biopsy will be performed at the end of the induction treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. - Randomisation and maintenance phase Only patients who respond to platinum-based&#xD;
           induction chemotherapy will be further randomised between olaparib and placebo. These&#xD;
           patients must have been treated with 6 cycles of chemotherapy. However, patients who&#xD;
           haven't received 6 cycles of the induction chemotherapy due to severe toxicity (grade 3&#xD;
           or 4, NCI CTCAE v4.0) could be randomized only if they had received 4 chemotherapy&#xD;
           cycles at least and if all treatment related toxicities are resolved to a grade ≤ 1 (NCI&#xD;
           CTCAE v4.0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will be administered at a dose of 600 mg daily (2 doses of 300 mg [2 tablets of 150&#xD;
      mg] taken approximately 12 hours apart) and cycle duration will be 28 days. Disease will be&#xD;
      assessed every 2 cycles by CTscan (MRI or PET-scan if the scan is not contributive) and&#xD;
      treatment will be administered until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients&#xD;
      will then be optimally managed according to local practice. Follow-up will be for a minimum&#xD;
      of 15 months from the time of randomization, and until last venue. All randomised patients&#xD;
      will be asked to provide translational blood samples at randomization, on treatment and at&#xD;
      the end of the treatment. Optional tumour biopsies will be performed at randomization, at the&#xD;
      end of the treatment (or at disease progression if available).&#xD;
