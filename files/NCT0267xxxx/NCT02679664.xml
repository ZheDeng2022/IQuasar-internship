  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The SAVER pilot is a randomized, open-label pilot study to determine the feasibility of&#xD;
      recruitment. In addition to feasibility data, the investigators will carefully collect&#xD;
      clinical data to determine if rosuvastatin can reduce post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) in&#xD;
      venous thromboembolism (VTE) patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible consenting patients who developed acute, symptomatic, and objectively confirmed&#xD;
      proximal leg deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or PE will be randomized and equally allocated to&#xD;
      2 trial arms, either the treatment group (rosuvastatin tablet (20 mg/day) or the control&#xD;
      group (usual care). The pilot trial consists of up to 4 study contacts over 6 months:&#xD;
      screening, randomization, telephone follow-up (90 days), and final study visit (180 days).&#xD;

      The SAVER pilot is a randomized, open-label pilot study to determine the feasibility of&#xD;
      recruitment. In addition to feasibility data, the investigators will carefully collect&#xD;
      clinical data to determine if rosuvastatin can reduce post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) in&#xD;
      venous thromboembolism (VTE) patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SCREENING: Research coordinators at each pilot site will screen patients for eligibility&#xD;
           and will complete detailed logs of all patients meeting inclusion (both enrolled and&#xD;
           excluded). After providing informed consent, eligibility will be confirmed by the&#xD;
           following tests : a lipid profile, A1C test/ CBC, transaminase (ALT) levels, Creatinine&#xD;
           and pregnancy test (if a female of child bearing potential). Consenting participants who&#xD;
           (following screening) do not meet eligibility criteria will be followed up to establish&#xD;
           feasibility outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  RANDOMIZATION: Randomization will be conducted using an Interactive Web based&#xD;
           Randomization System in a 1:1 ratio for treatment (20mg rosuvastatin od) or control (no&#xD;
           study drug).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  STUDY DRUG DISPENSING: Participants randomized to the treatment arm will be dispensed x&#xD;
           200 20mg tablets of rosuvastatin along with a medication diary.They will be educated on&#xD;
           study drug dosing regimen (20mg tablet od), how to complete their medication diary and&#xD;
           on the possible side-effects of rosuvastatin. They will be advised to contact either the&#xD;
           study coordinator, investigator or go directly to the emergency department should they&#xD;
           experience any symptoms in particular anything muscle related.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BASELINE. Assessments include;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Demographic data;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Concomitant medications (antiplatelet, anti-inflammatories, anticoagulation);&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Type of index VTE;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  PTS Villalta leg assessment conducted by both the participant (Patient Reported&#xD;
                Villalta [PRV] questionnaire) and a qualified blinded independent observer (The&#xD;
                Villalta scale is the most extensively validated tool and is recommended by the&#xD;
                ISTH) - (Primary Outcome);&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Risk factors for recurrent VTE, bleeding and arterial vascular events;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Medical history including prior VTE, Arterial disease, Liver disease and Glucose&#xD;
                Intolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  90 DAY FOLLOW UP [Treatment arm only]: Participants randomized to treatment will be&#xD;
           followed up via telephone or email at 90 days (+/- 21 days);&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participants will be asked questions to screen for;&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Study outcomes: Suspected VTE, Arterial, Bleeding and/ or Muscle Events&#xD;
                     Patients who report any unexplained muscle symptoms will be asked to have&#xD;
                     their Creatine kinase (CK) levels tested within 2 weeks of reporting the&#xD;
                     symptoms. Study drug will be discontinued if CK levels are markedly elevated&#xD;
                     (&gt; 10 x ULN).;&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Study Drug compliance&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Concomitant medication will be reviewed in case of any contraindications.&#xD;
                     Changes or additions in concomitant anticoagulation therapy, anti-platelet or&#xD;
                     anti - inflammatory medication will also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Study coordinators will log all follow up contact attempts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  FINAL STUDY VISIT (180 days (+/- 21 days): All study participants will be asked to&#xD;
           attend an in person study visit at 180 days (+/-21) for;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Follow-up of study outcomes; VTE, Arterial, Bleeding and Muscle events;&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
             -  Repeat PTS leg assessment (using the Villalta scale) both by a qualified&#xD;
                independent observer and the participant (Primary outcome);&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Study drug compliance: Medication Diaries and used medication bottles will be&#xD;
                collected by the study coordinator. Coordinator will perform a pill count and&#xD;
                reconcile with the participants medication diary. Coordinator will also ask&#xD;
                participant reasons for any missed doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADJUDICATION OF STUDY OUTCOMES: All Bleeding, VTE and Arterial Suspected Events as well as&#xD;
      deaths will be recorded on a suspected event CRF along with any diagnostic imaging/ tests and&#xD;
      will trigger a more in-depth evaluation, and review by an independent adjudication committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADVERSE EVENTS: AEs will be elicited, monitored and recorded throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All events meeting the definition of an SAE (as per ICH-GCP) must be reported to the SAVER&#xD;
      Trial Office in Ottawa, Canada within 24 h of awareness.&#xD;
