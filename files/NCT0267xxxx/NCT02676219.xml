  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study design is a randomised, split mouth, blind with respect to study analysts&#xD;
      (microscopist, image grader) two treatment clinical study in 10 healthy participants with&#xD;
      sound tooth enamel. The study will comprise of a screening visit, pre-baseline visit and 5&#xD;
      subsequent clinic visits. At the screening visit, participants will give consent to&#xD;
      participate in the study. Medical history and concomitant medications will be recorded.&#xD;
      Eligibility will be determined following an oral soft tissue (OST) examination and an&#xD;
      evaluation of dentition exclusions. Two suitable anterior teeth will be identified for study&#xD;
      assessments, these teeth must be at least one tooth apart in the mouth. Saliva samples will&#xD;
      be collected from the participants at set points during the study to look at any changes in&#xD;
      salivary pH.&#xD;
