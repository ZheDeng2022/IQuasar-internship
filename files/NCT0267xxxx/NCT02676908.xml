    <textblock>
      Compression stockings are traditionally worn for a period of time after varicose vein surgery&#xD;
      to reduce pain and bruising. The investigators provide an ambulatory endovenous ablation&#xD;
      service. Patients come to the Veins Unit, receive oral sedation, have their veins treated&#xD;
      with either laser or radiofrequency ablation plus phlebectomies* under local anaesthetic,&#xD;
      recover for an hour and then go home. *Phlebectomy describes the technique of pulling out&#xD;
      small varicose veins through small incisions in the overlying skin. The standard practice of&#xD;
      the Veins Unit is to advise patients to wear class two compression stockings for four weeks&#xD;
      post-operatively. Many patients would prefer a shorter period of time in stockings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Nice Guidelines for Varicose Veins has posed the question: 'How long should stockings be&#xD;
      worn for after endovenous ablation?'&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three trials have addressed this issue:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bakker looked at patients who wore stockings for either two or seven days after laser&#xD;
      ablation only; the group who wore stockings for seven days fared better.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elderman looked at patients who either wore no stockings or stockings for two weeks after&#xD;
      laser ablation only; the group who wore stockings for two weeks had less pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Krasznai looked at patients who wore stockings for either 4 hours or 72 hours after&#xD;
      radiofrequency ablation only; there was no significant difference in post-op pain among&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      None of these trials included patients who had phlebectomies at the same time. This study&#xD;
      aims to answer the question 'How long is it necessary to wear compression stockings for after&#xD;
      endovenous ablation (either laser or radiofrequency) plus concomitant phlebectomies?' The&#xD;
      investigators plan to divide 110 patients into two groups- either 'stockings for 2 weeks'&#xD;
      (trial group) or 'stockings for 4 weeks' (usual treatment group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-operatively, all patients will fill out a pain score and two short quality of life&#xD;
      questionnaires, one specific to varicose veins. Post-operatively at home, all patients will&#xD;
      be asked to keep a diary of pain and analgesia use. They will also document bruising at seven&#xD;
      days on charts and on a visual scale. At their four week clinic review, all patients will be&#xD;
      asked to fill out a pain and bruising score, a bruising chart and the two short quality of&#xD;
      life questionnaires again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The group with the best pain, bruising and quality of life scores post-operatively will help&#xD;
      guide duration of compression therapy for future patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The Nice Guidelines for Varicose Veins, published by the NHS in 2013, questioned the clinical&#xD;
      benefit of stockings after endovenous ablation, and if there is benefit, how long the&#xD;
      stockings should be worn for.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three randomised controlled trials have addressed these issues:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bakker and colleagues randomised 69 patients into two groups- stockings were worn for either&#xD;
      two or seven days after laser ablation. The group who wore stockings for seven days had&#xD;
      better pain and quality of life scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elderman and colleagues randomised 111 patients who had laser ablation into two groups- a&#xD;
      group who wore no stockings, or a group who wore stockings for two weeks. The group who wore&#xD;
      stockings for two weeks had less pain and required less analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Krasznai and colleagues randomised 101 patients into two groups- stockings were worn for&#xD;
      either 4 hours or 72 hours after radiofrequency ablation only; there was no significant&#xD;
      difference in post-op pain among groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      None of these trials included patients who had phlebectomies at the same time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study hopes to answer the question 'How long is it necessary to wear compression&#xD;
      stockings for after endovenous ablation (either laser or radiofrequency) plus concomitant&#xD;
      phlebectomies?'&#xD;
&#xD;
      110 consecutive patients will be randomised into 'stockings for 2 weeks' (trial group) or&#xD;
      'stockings for 4 weeks' (usual treatment group). Randomisation will be facilitated by online&#xD;
      random number generation (https://www.random.org/). Patients with odd numbers will be&#xD;
      allocated into the trial group; those randomly assigned even numbers will be allocated into&#xD;
      the usual treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-operatively, all patients will be asked to fill out a visual analog pain score (VAS), the&#xD;
      Aberdeen Varicose Veins questionnaire and the RAND 36-Item Health Survey. Patients will be&#xD;
      evaluated in terms of CAEP staging and the Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS) by the&#xD;
      supervising nurse or physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endovenous laser therapy (EVLT) plus phlebectomies or radiofrequency ablation (RFA) plus&#xD;
      phlebectomies will be performed in the standard manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial group will wear the stockings for 24 hours a day for the first 4 days, and then&#xD;
      during the day only for the next 10 days. The usual treatment group will wear the stockings&#xD;
      for 24 hours a day for a week, and then during the day only for the next 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operatively at home, patients will be asked to keep a diary of pain and analgesia use.&#xD;
      They will also document bruising at 7 days on a diagram and on a visual analog scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At their 4 week clinic review, again the VCSS will completed and patients will be asked to&#xD;
      fill out a visual analog pain and bruising score, a bruising diagram, the Aberdeen Varicose&#xD;
      Veins questionnaire and the RAND 36-Item Health Survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measures are post-operative pain scores on the visual analog scale and&#xD;
      post-operative bruising scores on the visual analog scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures are changes in veins-related quality of life measured on the&#xD;
      Aberdeen Varicose Veins Questionnaire and changes in overall quality of life based on the&#xD;
      RAND 36-Item Health Survey.&#xD;
