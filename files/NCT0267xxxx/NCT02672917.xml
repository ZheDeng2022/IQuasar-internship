      Phase 1 Safety and Tolerability Study in Subjects with Pancreatic Cancer or Other CA19-9&#xD;
      Positive Malignancies.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Open label, multicenter, non-randomized, dose escalation/expansion trial of MVT-5873 as a&#xD;
      single agent and in combination with modified FOLFIRINOX (mFOLFIRINOX) in subjects with&#xD;
      pancreatic and other CA19-9 positive malignancies. The study will define a Maximum Tolerated&#xD;
      Dose (MTD) of MVT-5873 for a Q2 week schedule (Group D), an MTD of MVT-5873 for a Q4 week&#xD;
      schedule (Group C), and an MTD for a Q2 week schedule of MVT-5873 in combination with&#xD;
      mFOLFIRINOX (Group E). Each group will utilize a conventional 3+3 study design to identify&#xD;
      the MTD and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the definition of an MTD in each group, the RP2D of MVT-5873 as a single agent and&#xD;
      in combination with mFOLFIRINOX will be defined. Following the completion of the dose&#xD;
      escalation phase for each group, an expansion group of up to 30 additional subjects will be&#xD;
      treated at the RP2D for each group. In Group D, subjects will be subdivided into two groups&#xD;
      of up to 15 subjects: subjects without peripheral blood expression of CA19-9 and subjects&#xD;
      with peripheral blood expression of CA19-9. MVT-5873 pharmacokinetics (PK) and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics (PD) will be determined in each group.&#xD;
