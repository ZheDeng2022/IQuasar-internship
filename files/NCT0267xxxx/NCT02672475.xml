      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of Galunisertib when given together&#xD;
      with paclitaxel in treating patients with androgen receptor negative or triple negative&#xD;
      breast cancer that has spread to other places in the body. Some tumors need growth factors,&#xD;
      which are made by the body's white blood cells, to keep growing. Galunisertib may interfere&#xD;
      with growth factors and help cause tumor cells to die. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as&#xD;
      paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the&#xD;
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving&#xD;
      Galunisertib together with paclitaxel may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of paclitaxel when administered with LY2157299&#xD;
      (Galunisertib).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of paclitaxel + LY2157299. III. To&#xD;
      determine the recommended dose of paclitaxel with LY2157299 for phase II studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the efficacy, as measured by median progression free survival (PFS), of&#xD;
      paclitaxel + LY2157299 in patients with metastatic androgen receptor negative triple negative&#xD;
      metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the efficacy, as measured by clinical benefit rate (CBR), of paclitaxel +&#xD;
      LY2157299 in patients with androgen receptor negative metastatic triple negative metastatic&#xD;
      breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) of paclitaxel + LY2157299 in patients with&#xD;
      androgen receptor negative metastatic triple negative breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To interrogate the entire coding sequence of 236 cancer-related genes (3,769 exons) plus&#xD;
      47 introns from 19 genes often rearranged or altered in cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Nanostring analysis of established gene expression signatures. III. Determine breast&#xD;
      cancer subtype by PAM50 testing and correlate with response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To measure changes in circulating plasma transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1),&#xD;
      interleukin (IL)-6, and cluster of differentiation 34 (CD34) positive (+), peripheral blood&#xD;
      mononuclear cells (PBMCs) induced by LY2157299.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of Galunisertib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) on days 1, 8, and 15. Patients also receive&#xD;
      Galunisertib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14. Courses repeat every 28 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.&#xD;
