  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of an engineered cartilage&#xD;
      transplant (N-TEC) in comparison to a cell-activated matrix (N-CAM) for the treatment of&#xD;
      articular cartilage lesions in the knee. The main innovations in this trial are the use of&#xD;
      nasal chondrocytes and the implantation of a tissue in contrast to cells seeded on a matrix.&#xD;
      The goals of the trial are to: (i) evaluate whether implantation of a more mature graft&#xD;
      (tissue therapy) is beneficial for the quality and durability of the repair tissue and the&#xD;
      clinical outcome, (ii)determine the potential of the mature graft to integrate with the&#xD;
      adjacent cartilage and form hyaline repair tissue and (iii) assess the efficacy of each&#xD;
      treatment in correlation to the characteristics of the defect (e.g. &quot;acute&quot; versus &quot;chronic&quot;&#xD;
      setting).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although cartilage damages in the joint develop mostly in older people due to degeneration of&#xD;
      the cartilage, they also occur regularly in young people due to accidents. Especially in&#xD;
      large cartilage defects there is no spontaneous self-healing. If these defects are left&#xD;
      untreated, the risk of the development of osteoarthritis later on is significantly increased.&#xD;
      However, the current treatment options for these defects involve difficult operation&#xD;
      techniques, require tedious rehabilitation and are limited in the application for large&#xD;
      injuries and the availability/quality of the donor material. Furthermore, they often lead to&#xD;
      not entirely satisfactory clinical results due to the low quality of the repair tissue. In&#xD;
      many cases permanent pain and restricted mobility persist. Even the use of the new cell&#xD;
      therapies has not led to satisfactory results in the long term. An innovative promising&#xD;
      approach is tissue engineering, where cartilage is manufactured in the laboratory using the&#xD;
      body's own cells. First results of a clinical phase I study show that the use of engineered&#xD;
      nasal cartilage for the regeneration of articular cartilage (knee joint) is feasible and&#xD;
      safe. In addition the preliminary clinical results regarding the efficacy are also promising.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this phase II clinical study is to compare the efficacy of the tissue therapy&#xD;
      with the one of the cell therapy. In order to achieve this the investigators will enroll 108&#xD;
      patients in the study and divide them in two groups, one receiving the cell therapy and the&#xD;
      other the tissue therapy. Patients must display a symptomatic, isolated cartilage lesion&#xD;
      grade III-IV (according to the grading by the International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS))&#xD;
      from 2 to 8 cm2 on the femoral condyle and/or the trochlea, have to be between 18-65 years&#xD;
      old and must consent in oral and written manner in order to be enrolled in the study. After&#xD;
      written informed consent has been obtained, the patients will be tested to see if they comply&#xD;
      with all other inclusion and exclusion criteria. Subsequently blood (72ml) and a cartilage&#xD;
      biopsy (tissue sample) from the nasal septum of the patient will be taken. The cartilage&#xD;
      cells (Chondrocytes) are isolated from the tissue, expanded for 2 weeks and placed on a&#xD;
      collagen matrix. For the cell therapy the resulting construct will be cultured for 2 more&#xD;
      days to allow the cells to adhere to the matrix. For the tissue therapy the construct will be&#xD;
      cultured for 2 more weeks, to allow the cells to form cartilage tissue. After performing the&#xD;
      quality tests the implant will be released by the manufacturer based on the sterility, cell&#xD;
      viability and in case of the tissue therapy product the deposition of matrix. Subsequently,&#xD;
      the construct will be implanted in the knee. At 6 weeks as well as 3, 12 and 24 months after&#xD;
      the operation follow-ups will be performed. During the follow-ups at 12 and 24 months&#xD;
      questionnaires (KOOS, Euro Quality of Life (EQ)-5d) will be filled out by the patient and&#xD;
      MRIs will be performed at 3,12 and 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the questionnaires (especially the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score&#xD;
      (KOOS-Score)) provide subjective information about the efficacy of the treatment, the MRIs&#xD;
      will shed light on the integration of the implant in the defect and give information about&#xD;
      the quality of the repair tissue. Retrospectively the data will be analyzed in correlation to&#xD;
      the status of the defect at time of treatment: acute (symptoms since less than 2 years) or&#xD;
      chronic (symptoms since more than 2 years). This will give an indication whether one&#xD;
      treatment (cell or tissue therapy) is more effective for a defined indication (acute or&#xD;
      chronic) than the other.&#xD;
