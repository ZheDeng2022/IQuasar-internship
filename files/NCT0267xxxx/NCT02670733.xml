  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are concerns that the use of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) for the treatment&#xD;
      of pulmonary complications in patients with brain injury may potentially elevate intracranial&#xD;
      pressure (ICP), and deteriorate neurological status. It is suggested that both respiratory&#xD;
      system compliance and ventricular compliance would contribute to the elevation of ICP when&#xD;
      PEEP increases. In theory, PEEP may cause elevation of ICP by increasing intrathoracic&#xD;
      pressure and diminish venous return. However, the transmission of PEEP into thoracic cavity&#xD;
      depends on the properties of the lung and chest wall. Experimental study showed that when&#xD;
      chest wall compliance is low, PEEP can significantly increases intrathoracic pressure;&#xD;
      whereas low lung compliance can minimize airway pressure transmission. It is generally&#xD;
      recognized that the lung compliance decreases in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)&#xD;
      patients due to extensive alveolar collapse. However, it has been report that the elastance&#xD;
      ratio (the ratio between elastance of the chest wall and the respiratory system, where&#xD;
      elastance is the reciprocal of compliance) may vary from 0.2 to 0.8. Therefore, it is&#xD;
      important to distinguish the compliance of the chest wall and the lung when investigating the&#xD;
      effect of PEEP on ICP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because intrathoracic pressure (pleural pressure) is difficult to measure in clinical&#xD;
      situations, esophageal pressure (Pes) is considered as a surrogate of intrathoracic pressure.&#xD;
      In the present study, the investigators determine the effect of PEEP on intrathoracic&#xD;
      pressure and ICP by Pes measurement.&#xD;
