  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Shoulder arthroplasty is a reliable procedure for the treatment of severe shoulder joint&#xD;
      diseases to relieve pain and restore shoulder function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shoulder implants commonly used are characterised by a humeral stem and complications related&#xD;
      to the stem are not infrequent. These include: bone stock loss, intraoperative and&#xD;
      postoperative break around the implant, malpositioning of the humeral component and difficult&#xD;
      eradication of infections inside the bone around the implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the aim of reducing stem-related complications, a novel prosthesis characterised by a&#xD;
      stem-less design has been developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is therefore to explore how well people recover after shoulder&#xD;
      replacement with this novel stem-less shoulder prosthesis. This will be assessed over 5 years&#xD;
      in three different countries in Europe using patient completed questionnaires and clinical&#xD;
      and radiographic assessments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis at the base of the study is that the SMR stemless system might contribute to&#xD;
      ensure good clinical outcomes and an effective stability and might avoid the potential&#xD;
      complications associated with a traditional stemmed implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess clinical, radiographic and subjective outcomes after&#xD;
      anatomic or reverse shoulder arthroplasty with a SMR stemless prosthesis, define the&#xD;
      survivorship of the implant and identify possible risk factors that may lead to failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a post-marketing clinical study, because the study device is registered, CE marked&#xD;
      and used according to the intended use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is an international, multi-centre, prospective case series. The assignment of any patient&#xD;
      involved in the study is determined by the aetiology preoperatively evaluated by the&#xD;
      Investigator and falls within current practice. The decision to use a specific prosthesis&#xD;
      design is decided by the Investigators independently and clearly separated from the decision&#xD;
      to include the patient in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation has an internal control because the assessment of post-surgery data is&#xD;
      compared to baseline measurements (pre-operative clinical analysis and radiographic analysis&#xD;
      at discharge). It is open label.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigation will be carried out in 3 sites in Europe for a maximum total number of 78&#xD;
      treated patients. Accrual will be competitive until the required recruitment target is met.&#xD;
      Equal numbers will be recruited at each of three centres (26 patients per site), but a&#xD;
      deviation of 8 participants will be accepted (minimum of 18 and maximum of 34 participants&#xD;
      recruited per site).&#xD;
