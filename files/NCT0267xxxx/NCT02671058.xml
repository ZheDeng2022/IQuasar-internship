      This study will be an open label, single dose, randomized, 2 way (2 period) crossover study&#xD;
      in healthy adult subjects at a single study center. Screening evaluations will occur from Day&#xD;
      28 to Day 2 and subjects will be confined to the clinical research unit (CRU) from Day 1 to&#xD;
      Day 2 for each treatment period. The treatment periods will be separated by at least a 7 day&#xD;
      washout period. Subjects meeting the study enrollment criteria will be randomly assigned to 1&#xD;
      of 2 sequences (AB or BA) on Day 1 of Treatment Period 1 and will receive either the&#xD;
      reference product (A) or the treatment product (B) once during the study&#xD;
