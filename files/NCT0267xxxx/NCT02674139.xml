    <textblock>
      The study aims to compare immediate post-placental (within 10 minutes of placenta delivery)&#xD;
      intrauterine contraceptive device (Copper T 380A) insertion versus conventional placement at&#xD;
      6 weeks (often referred to as delayed or interval insertion) regarding the clinical outcomes&#xD;
      (safety, efficacy, expulsion and continuation rates) for women undergoing caesarean section.&#xD;

      • Study Design: A controlled randomized clinical trial (CRCT)&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Study Site: The study will be carried out in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at&#xD;
      Beni-suef University Hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Study Population: The study population will include pregnant women between 36-40 weeks&#xD;
      gestational ages who attend antenatal care and are eligible for insertion of IUCD during&#xD;
      delivery through elective caesarean section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Study Sample: The study will consist of 200 women which will be chosen randomly to whom&#xD;
      elective lower segment caesarean section will be done at the Obstetrics and Gynecology&#xD;
      department, willing to have an intrauterine device (IUD) inserted for postpartum&#xD;
      contraception and willing to comply with the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After informed consent is obtained, eligible study participants will be randomized into 2&#xD;
      groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group (A): 100 Women will receive the Pregna ® IUD at the 6 week postpartum visit Group (B):&#xD;
      100 Women will receive the Pregna ® IUD within 10 minutes of delivery of the placenta during&#xD;
      caesarean section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Study Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insertion Technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During caesarean section:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uterine cavity will be inspected for presence of malformations following placental delivery,&#xD;
      which would limit use of IUCD.The IUCD (Pregna Copper T 380A) will be removed from the&#xD;
      insertion sleeve and will be placed on the sterile field. Uterus is stabilized by grasping it&#xD;
      at fundus. Insertion will be done during cesarean delivery, after ex pulsion of placenta and&#xD;
      through the uterine incision, manually (IUCD is Held between middle and index finger). It&#xD;
      will be inserted into the uterus through uterine incision and will be released at fundus of&#xD;
      uterus. Hand will be removed slowly from the uterus. Enough care will be taken not to&#xD;
      dislodge IUCD as hand is removed. Strings will be guided toward the lower uterine segment&#xD;
      without disturbing IUCD'S fundal position. Enough Care will be taken not to include IUCD&#xD;
      strings during uterine closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delayed postpartum IUDs Will be inserted in the usual sterile fashion as described in the&#xD;
      manufacturer's instructions at the 6-week postpartum visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      Later Prior to Discharge:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IUCD Client card, showing type of IUCD and date of insertion will be given to patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  She will be informed about the IUCD side effects and normal postpartum symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients will be scheduled for a control examination at 1 week, 6 weeks, 3 months&#xD;
                and 6 months after the insertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  She will be advised to contact one of the physicians immediately if they&#xD;
                experienced:-&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Unusual vaginal discharge different from the usual lochia.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Lower abdominal pain, especially if accompanied by fever or chills.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Feeling of being pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Suspicion that the IUCD has fallen out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At each visit the patients will be questioned for symptoms of expulsion, excessive&#xD;
           bleeding and infection. In addition, a pelvic examination (per speculum) and&#xD;
           trans-vaginal ultrasound will be performed at each follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In per speculum examination if IUD threads are long, they will be cut 2 cm from external&#xD;
           os. If threads of IUD are not seen and there was no history of expulsion of IUD, pelvic&#xD;
           ultrasonography or X-ray pelvis will be done to note for misplaced IUD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All the patients will subjected to the follow up:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The IUD will be removed in the case of partial expulsion, bleeding or pain, or at the&#xD;
           patient's request.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Ethical Considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
                1-Approval by the institution ethical committee 2-Individual Consent Process:&#xD;
                Written informed consent will be taken after explaining the study objective the&#xD;
                procedures to potential participants. Participation will be voluntary and&#xD;
                participants will be informed that the decision not to participate will not impact&#xD;
                on the quality of care they receive.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be statistically described in terms of mean + standard deviation (+/- SD),&#xD;
      frequencies (number of cases) and relative frequencies (percentages) when appropriate.&#xD;
      Comparison of numerical variables between the study groups will be done using Student t test&#xD;
      for independent samples. For comparing categorical data, Chi square (X2) test will be&#xD;
      performed. Exact test will be used instead when the expected frequency is less than 5. P&#xD;
      values less than 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
