  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of freeze-dried, capsulized FMT and fresh&#xD;
      FMT in adults with slow transit constipation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Constipation is a chronic disease estimated to affect about 10% - 15% of the worldwide&#xD;
      general population. Constipation frequency appears to augment with increasing age,&#xD;
      particularly after 65 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent evidence in the literature and collected in the investigators' laboratory confirm that&#xD;
      constipation can be a consequence of intestinal dysbiosis, with an increase of potentially&#xD;
      pathogenic microorganisms and a decrease of potentially beneficial microorganisms. These&#xD;
      alterations may affect the motility and metabolic environment of colon, especially the&#xD;
      production of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new and under-explored method to manipulate the gastrointestinal microbiota involves fecal&#xD;
      microbiota transplantation (FMT). There has been growing interest in the use of fecal&#xD;
      microbiota for the treatment of patients with chronic gastrointestinal infections (e.g. CDI)&#xD;
      and other extraintestinal conditions (e.g. IBD). Similarly, the investigators suppose that&#xD;
      reshaping the gut microbiome with FMT would be effective for patients with slow transit&#xD;
      constipation.&#xD;
