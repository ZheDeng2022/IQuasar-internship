      Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of dental hygienist support on&#xD;
      oral health and attitudes to oral healthcare in nursing homes for older people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Studies in long-term care facilities have indicated that oral health is often&#xD;
      unsatisfactory. It is important that nursing staff are able to assist dependent care&#xD;
      recipients. Dental hygienist support has been suggested as valuable help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods: Two nursing homes were randomly selected for intervention and control.&#xD;
      Interventions included weekly support from dental hygienists on oral hygiene procedures,&#xD;
      prescriptions for individual oral hygiene procedures, and oral care organisational issues.&#xD;
      The residents' oral health, measured by dental plaque levels, gingival bleeding and the&#xD;
      Revised Oral Assessment Guide (ROAG), was evaluated before and after three months. Attitudes&#xD;
      among the staff to oral healthcare were collected through a questionnaire.&#xD;

      Introduction Oral health in older people has been the subject of several studies from&#xD;
      different perspectives in recent decades. These studies describe the difficulties in&#xD;
      achieving a holistic view in healthcare when it comes to oral health for older people, and a&#xD;
      lack of awareness among nursing staff that infections in the oral cavity may also affect&#xD;
      other parts of the body. In a randomised study, it was shown that professional oral&#xD;
      healthcare may improve oral conditions in elderly people. Studies have shown correlations&#xD;
      between poor oral hygiene and pneumonia in elderly people. It has also been shown that both&#xD;
      chewing ability and daily nutritional intake may be adversely affected in individuals with&#xD;
      partial or full dentures compared to those with natural teeth or crown and bridge work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure good oral health and function, it is of great importance that nursing staff are&#xD;
      able to support dependent older people in their daily oral care. Basic oral health knowledge&#xD;
      among nursing staff and further training in oral hygiene procedures have been reported to be&#xD;
      essential to good quality in oral care. In a study from Norway, it was shown that the&#xD;
      residents' oral hygiene in nursing homes was significantly improved when an oral healthcare&#xD;
      program was introduced. The program consisted of new procedures and tools for good oral&#xD;
      hygiene, as well as practical training in oral care for nursing staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An earlier study by the authors of the present study captured the views of staff in various&#xD;
      nursing homes for older people on important aspects for well-functioning daily oral care for&#xD;
      residents. This study emphasised organisational structures involving oral hygiene procedures,&#xD;
      staff approach regarding prioritising oral hygiene and keeping up skills in oral hygiene&#xD;
      procedures, and staff views on residents' needs including matters such as how to act when a&#xD;
      resident refuses help with oral care. Support by a dental hygienist in the nursing home was&#xD;
      perceived as valuable help. Other authors have made similar findings in long-term care&#xD;
      facilities, indicating that oral hygiene may be unsatisfactory due to organisational factors&#xD;
      such as lack of a standard protocol for oral hygiene procedures, lack of time and conflicting&#xD;
      priorities, lack of knowledge among care providers and cooperation difficulties among some&#xD;
      residents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of dental hygienist support on oral&#xD;
      health and attitudes to oral health care in nursing homes for older people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Methods The study had a quantitative design with two comparable study groups&#xD;
      with older people in two nursing homes. The two most centrally situated public nursing homes&#xD;
      in the largest municipality in the county of Värmland in Sweden were randomly selected as&#xD;
      intervention and control group. The Regional Ethical Review Board in Uppsala approved the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study material The two nursing homes were comparable regarding size, resident profile, and&#xD;
      staffing. The residents included older people with dementia, physical disabilities or&#xD;
      long-term illnesses. One director of nursing, one registered nurse and 21 nursing assistants&#xD;
      worked at the intervention nursing home. One director of nursing, one registered nurse and 28&#xD;
      nursing assistants worked at the control nursing home. All but one of the staff members were&#xD;
      women. There were 33 residents in each of the two nursing homes. Only dentate residents were&#xD;
      included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures The Director of Social Services in the municipality was given verbal and written&#xD;
      information and approved the study. The directors of nursing at the intervention and control&#xD;
      nursing homes were separately informed, both verbally and in writing, about the procedures&#xD;
      for their respective part of the study. They were not informed which additional nursing home&#xD;
      was participating in the study. The directors of nursing at both nursing homes supplied the&#xD;
      residents or their relatives with written information about the study and asked for written&#xD;
      consent. Only those who consented to participate in the study were included. Edentulous&#xD;
      residents were excluded from the study. The nursing assistants agreed to participate in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the intervention nursing home, the study dental hygienists offered regular support over&#xD;
      the course of three months, comprising the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participation in staff meetings with the director of nursing and nursing assistants at&#xD;
           the beginning of the study, after six weeks and at the end of the study period. At those&#xD;
           meetings, oral care routines were discussed and a concept of prescriptions for&#xD;
           individual oral hygiene procedures was introduced (see below).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visits to the nursing home once a week. For two hours in the morning, the dental&#xD;
           hygienists accompanied and supported the nursing staff in their oral hygiene care and&#xD;
           gave advice on daily oral hygiene procedures for each resident participating in the&#xD;
           study. Specific difficulties concerning residents with cooperation problems were&#xD;
           addressed. Each weekly visit ended with a 30 min meeting in which the nursing staff had&#xD;
           the opportunity to discuss oral hygiene procedures and oral health issues with the&#xD;
           dental hygienists.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individual written oral hygiene prescriptions for special oral hygiene devices,&#xD;
           procedures or products. These were issued by the dental hygienists to residents with an&#xD;
           identified need for extra oral care support, i.e. with scores &gt;1 in the Revised Oral&#xD;
           Assessment Guide (ROAG) evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control&#xD;
&#xD;
      At study start, the director of nursing for the control nursing home was informed about the&#xD;
      importance of good oral hygiene and was invited to contact the two study dental hygienists if&#xD;
      support was needed with any particular oral health issue or dental hygiene procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical evaluation of oral health Clinical evaluations of the residents' oral health status&#xD;
      were blinded. An independent dentist and dental hygienist, otherwise not committed to the&#xD;
      planning of the study and not informed about which was the intervention nursing home,&#xD;
      conducted a dental examination of the residents who had consented to take part in the study&#xD;
      in both nursing homes. This was done at the beginning of the study and three months later at&#xD;
      the end of the study. The staff were not informed about the scheduled time for the clinical&#xD;
      evaluations of the residents' oral health.&#xD;
