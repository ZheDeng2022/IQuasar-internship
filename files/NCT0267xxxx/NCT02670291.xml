    <textblock>
      This randomized, sham-controlled, double blind, multicentre clinical trial aims at providing&#xD;
      evidence for the efficacy and safety of continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) in the&#xD;
      treatment of auditory hallucinations in patients with schizophrenia. Overall, the study will&#xD;
      include 137 patients. Because of the adaptive study design, an interim analysis was performed&#xD;
      after half of the originally planned patients (43/86), according to which the sample size was&#xD;
      increased by 51 patients). Each patient will receive a three weeks course of daily (5/week)&#xD;
      treatment; 50% of the patients will be treated with cTBS (1200 impulses daily), the other&#xD;
      half with a sham stimulation to the left and right temporoparietal cortex. Sham stimulation&#xD;
      will be applied by an active sham-coil that allows for a double-blind treatment. Follow-up&#xD;
      assessments 1, 3 and 6 months after treatment will investigate the stability of treatment&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Auditory verbal hallucinations (AH), a cardinal feature of schizophrenia, are often severely&#xD;
      distressing and increase the risk for violence and suicide. Although antipsychotic medication&#xD;
      mostly exerts rapid beneficial effects on this symptom particularly in first-episode patients&#xD;
      who continue on taking their medication (Sommer et al. 2012), in up to 25%-30% of all&#xD;
      patients, such hallucinations persist (Shergill et al. 1998). The often progressive course of&#xD;
      the disease and insufficient treatment adherence due to unwanted side effects significantly&#xD;
      limit the treatment response. In turn, this lack of treatment efficacy also contributes to&#xD;
      low treatment adherence which is generally associated with an unfavorable course of&#xD;
      schizophrenia and increased relapse and readmission rate. New and effective treatments are&#xD;
      therefore essential to reduce the massive individual burden and psychosocial costs associated&#xD;
      with schizophrenia. Nevertheless, in the last decades, the hopes for new pharmacological&#xD;
      treatment options have been disappointed and the pharmaceutical industry has apparently&#xD;
      withdrawn from the development of new compounds for this disorder. Accordingly, the&#xD;
      development of non-pharmacological approaches based on an increasing body of&#xD;
      patho-physiological knowledge is even more needed to pave new ways for the treatment of this&#xD;
      frequently detrimental symptom of schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the present study is to provide high-level evidence for efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) in the treatment of auditory&#xD;
      hallucination (AH) by this first full-size multicenter (3 centers) controlled clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a double blind (actually triple blind, i.e. patient, clinical investigator, and&#xD;
      person who will administer cTBS), randomized, sham-controlled clinical trial to test the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of bilateral (successively applied) daily cTBS to the temporoparietal&#xD;
      cortex on the severity of AH. The study will be conducted in a two-armed parallel design in&#xD;
      which 50 % of the patients will be treated with the verum stimulation and the other half of&#xD;
      patients will receive the placebo / sham stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cTBS protocol follows the method by Huang et al. (2005) and our pilot study (Plewnia et&#xD;
      al. 2014a) to achieve a lasting reduction of cortical excitability. Accordingly, each&#xD;
      stimulation train (40 s) of cTBS consists of 600 stimuli applied in bursts of 3 pulses at 50&#xD;
      Hz given every 200 ms (5 Hz). Stimulation intensity is standardized at 80% of the resting&#xD;
      motor threshold (RMT) and applied successively to each hemisphere. For the first session, the&#xD;
      order of right and left hemisphere will be determined by randomization and will alternate in&#xD;
      each following session to preclude order effects.The RMT will be determined using EMG&#xD;
      recordings from the left and right abductor pollicis brevis and defined as the minimal&#xD;
      stimulation intensity needed to elicit at least 10 out of 20 motor-evoked-potentials of ≥&#xD;
      50µV. RMT will be determined once, i.e. before the beginning of treatment period. The cTBS or&#xD;
      sham treatment will be targeted both temporoparietal cortices halfway between T3/P3 and T4/P4&#xD;
      (EEG 10/20 system).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment (active cTBS or sham cTBS) will be administered over a period of 3 consecutive&#xD;
      weeks at each workday (Monday to Friday), resulting in a total of 15 treatment sessions.&#xD;
      Ratings will be performed after the last treatment of each week by an independent rater.&#xD;
      Follow-up visits are planned 1, 3 and 6 months after end of treatment phase to control for&#xD;
      sustainability of cTBS treatment effects.&#xD;
