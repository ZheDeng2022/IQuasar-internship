      1. Isolation and Culture of hMSM-Derived Cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The tissue will be washed again with Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) that included&#xD;
           antibiotic and antimytotic, cut into small pieces under aseptic conditions, treated with&#xD;
           0.06% collagenase type II (In vitrogen) and dispase, shaken with an incubator (CO2&#xD;
           incubator, Forma Scientific) containing 5% CO2 at 37°C for 4 hours, and centrifuged at&#xD;
           1,000 (Revolution Per Minute) for 10 minutes (large-capacity tabletop centrifuge).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The precipitate was suspended in an alpha minimum essential medium (α-MEM)&#xD;
                (Sigma-Aldrich) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin&#xD;
                and filtered with a 40-μm cell strainer (BD Bioscience), with which all tissues&#xD;
                except for the hMSSM-derived cells were filtered out.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The solution filtered out was cultured in an incubator. Daily morphologic&#xD;
                characteristics will be observed with an inverted microscope, and the culture&#xD;
                solution will be changed every other day. When the medium will be changed, cells&#xD;
                not adherent to the culture plate will be removed and only the adherent cells will&#xD;
                be cultured. When the culture dishes become nearly confluent, the cells will be&#xD;
                separated with Trypsin-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and subsequently&#xD;
                repeated for continued passaging. The cells will be assayed at passage 3 for their&#xD;
                osteogenic potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Flow Cytometry. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis for the expression&#xD;
           of osteoprogenitor cell markers was performed on samples from primary cells (P0),&#xD;
           passage 1 (P1) cultures, and passage 2 (P2) cultures cultured in nonosteogenic medium.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Flow cytometry on the cell surface markers STRO-1, CD105, and CD146 for separation of&#xD;
           Mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs) from hMSM will be conducted. The hMSSM-derived cells&#xD;
           at passage 3 will be placed into a test tube (Becton- Dickinson) by 1 x104 cells/mL and&#xD;
           washed three times with wash buffer (0.2% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% sodium azide, 0.5&#xD;
           mmol/L EDTA). The antibodies of CD146 (BD Bioscience) and CD105 (BD Bioscience) to which&#xD;
           fluorescein isothiocyanate and phycoerythrin were adhered will be treated for 1 hour and&#xD;
           washed with wash buffer three times, and the origin of stem cell was observed with flow&#xD;
           cytometry (BD bioscience). For STRO-1 (human antimouse monoclonal antibody,&#xD;
           immunoglobulin M subclass; R&amp;D Systems), antibody was treated for 1 hour and washed&#xD;
           three times with wash buffer, and the secondary antibody, to which fluorescein&#xD;
           isothiocyanate was attached, was treated for 30 minutes, washed three times with wash&#xD;
           buffer, and observed with flow cytometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Osteogenic Differentiation of hMSM&#xD;
&#xD;
           The hMSM-derived cells at passage 3 were incubated in osteogenic media for 1 to 4 weeks&#xD;
           in 12 well plates at a density of 105 cells per well and divided into two groups. The&#xD;
           control group was replated in a normal medium (complete α-MEM), and the experimental&#xD;
           group was replated in osteogenic differentiation medium (α-MEM including 0.1 μm&#xD;
           dexamethasone, 10 μm glycerol phosphate, and 50 μm L-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate). The&#xD;
           media were changed every 3 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.1- Alkaline Phosphatase and Alizarin Red Staining. Control and experimental cultures&#xD;
           were each washed three times with sterile triple-distilled water at 7, 14, 21, and 28&#xD;
           days after the treatment date, fixed with citrate-acetone- formaldehyde fixation&#xD;
           solution (Sigma), and washed again three times with sterile triple-distilled water. They&#xD;
           were then stained with an alkaline dye mixture (nitrite, Fast Red Violet-alkaline,&#xD;
           naphthol alkaline solution; Sigma), in the dark for 15 minutes at normal temperature,&#xD;
           washed three times with sterile triple-distilled water, counterstained with hematoxylin&#xD;
           (Sigma), washed again three times with sterile triple-distilled water, and observed with&#xD;
           an inverted microscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Alizarin Red Staining. Control and experimental group samples were each washed three&#xD;
           times with sterile triple-distilled water at 7, 14, 21, and 28 days from the treatment&#xD;
           date, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Merck) for 15 minutes, stained while light was&#xD;
           isolated for 30 minutes with 2% alizarin red solution (Sigma), washed again three times&#xD;
           with sterile triple-distilled water, and the staining will be observed with an inverted&#xD;
           microscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.2- Von Kossa Staining. Control and experimental cultures were washed three times with&#xD;
           sterile triple-dis- tilled water, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Merck) at a normal&#xD;
           temperature for 15 minutes and washed again three times with sterile triple-distilled&#xD;
           water. They were stained for 30 minutes while light was isolated with 1% silver nitrate&#xD;
           (Merck) solution, washed three times with sterile triple-distilled water, left under&#xD;
           ultraviolet light for 1 hour, counterstained with 0.1% eosin (Sigma), and the staining&#xD;
           will be observed with an inverted microscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.3- Quantitative PCR (qPCR). To observe osteocalcin expression, the hMSM-derived cells,&#xD;
           differentiated into two groups, were washed with (PBS) at 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after&#xD;
           treatment in osteogenic differentiation medium and collected with a cell scraper. After&#xD;
           the Ribonucleic acid (RNA) was separated with an RNA extraction kit, it underwent a&#xD;
           reverse-transcription reaction with the separated RNA, osteocalcin, or bone&#xD;
           sialoprotein, or dentin matrix protein 1 primers and probes, and reverse-transcriptase&#xD;
           polymerase chain reaction premix (Applied Biosystems). The obtained data will be&#xD;
           normalized using 18 Shake. The amplified products were analyzed using the deal-delta&#xD;
           Computer Tomography analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Histochemical staining of alkaline phosphatase activity in frozen sections of sinus&#xD;
           mucosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Freshly prepared sinus mucosa was washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), cut into&#xD;
           pieces of approximately 5x 5 mm, embedded in optimum cutting temperature tissue compound&#xD;
           (OCT compound; Miles Laboratories, USA), and stored at - 80 C. Frozen sections (7 mm)&#xD;
           mounted on poly-D-lysine-coated slides were fixed with ice-cold acetone for 1 min and&#xD;
           allowed to air dry. The slides were washed with PBS and subsequently incubated with the&#xD;
           substrate solution for alkaline phosphatase activity containing 4 mg of naphthol&#xD;
           phosphate in 0.15 ml of N, N0 -dimethyl- formamide and 12mg of fast blue salt (Sigma, St&#xD;
           Louis, USA) in 15 ml of Tris-Hydrogen Chloride (pH 9.6). After rinsing with distilled&#xD;
           water, slides were counterstained with hematoxylin-eosin, embedded into water-soluble&#xD;
           resin, and photographed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Immunohistochemical determination of STRO-1-positive cells in frozen sections of mucosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frozen sections (7 mm) were fixed with cold acetone for 1 min and washed in PBS. The slides&#xD;
      were placed into PBS containing 0.3% of hydrogen peroxide for 15 minutes to quench endogenous&#xD;
      peroxidase, washed, and blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1hour at room&#xD;
      temperature. Sections were incubated with a 1: 50 dilution of the STRO-1 antibody (mouse&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody, IgM subclass; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa,&#xD;
      USA) in blocking solution overnight at 41 degree C. For detection of STRO-1-positive cells,&#xD;
      slides were incubated with a biotinylated goat anti-mouse Immune globulin M (IgM) (1 : 100,&#xD;
      An der Grub, Vienna, Austria) and a streptavidin-peroxidase conjugate (BioFX Laboratories,&#xD;
      Inc., MD, USA) each at room temperature for 45 min. The peroxidase-containing complex was&#xD;
      visualized by Diaminobenzidine substrate (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) and counterstained with&#xD;
      hematoxylin. The sections were embedded into water-soluble resin and photographed.&#xD;
