    <textblock>
      The study aims to define and compare the immunological characteristics (lymphocyte&#xD;
      subpopulations, specific immunity against HIV, lymphocyte activation, inflammatory&#xD;
      parameters) and the virological characteristics (study of viral reservoir) between 2 groups&#xD;
      of vertically-HIV-1-infected children, between 5 and 17-year-of-age, who started cART before&#xD;
      6 months-of-age (&quot;early treatment&quot; group) or after 24 months-of-age (&quot;late treatment&quot; group)&#xD;
      with an initial virologic success (HIV-1 RNA &lt;400 copies / mL reached no later than 24 months&#xD;
      after the start of cART), whatever the later evolution of the viremia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, the viral reservoir will be deeply characterized in 10 children (5 patients in each&#xD;
      group) with sustained control of the HIV-1 viremia under cART (≥ 90% of HIV-1 RNA measures&#xD;
      &lt;400 copies /mL): quantification of the reservoir in the lymphocyte subpopulations and study&#xD;
      of the inductibility of the viral reservoir.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a cross-sectional study, multicenter, without direct benefit, among vertically HIV-1&#xD;
      infected children, aged 5 to 17 years, followed in centers participating in the ANRS CO10 EPF&#xD;
      cohort located in Ile-de-France. Eligible children are not necessarily included in the&#xD;
      cohort. The sample will consist of two age groups of equal size (5-12 years and 13-17 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient recruitment will be conducted in the centers of the ANRS CO10 EPF cohort located in&#xD;
      Ile de France (Paris area). 80 children will be included, previously included or not in the&#xD;
      ANRS CO10 EPF cohort. Our investigations will involve two blood samples, taken during two&#xD;
      successive visits of the children in the hospitals where they are usually followed. Finally,&#xD;
      a third blood sample will be taken during a third visit only for the 10 children&#xD;
      participating in the substudy of the viral reservoir. All medical data since birth will be&#xD;
      prospectively collected for children included in the ANRS CO10 EPF cohort, and&#xD;
      retrospectively collected in the other cases.&#xD;
