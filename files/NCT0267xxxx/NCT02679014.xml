    <textblock>
      A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two treatment, parallel group study to&#xD;
      investigate the effects of RO5459072, a cathepsin S inhibitor, on the immune response to a&#xD;
      gluten challenge in volunteers with celiac disease. Volunteers with previously diagnosed&#xD;
      celiac disease will be randomized to receive either 100 milligrams (mg) RO5459072 or placebo&#xD;
      twice daily with food for 28 days (Days 1 to 28).&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  A history of stomach or intestinal surgery or resection. Appendectomy and hernia&#xD;
             repair are acceptable&#xD;

             drug, or multiple allergies (non-active hay fever is acceptable)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Immunocompromised or with reduced immune function considered to be clinically&#xD;
             significant by the Investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Immunization within 30 days before the screening visit or planning vaccination during&#xD;
