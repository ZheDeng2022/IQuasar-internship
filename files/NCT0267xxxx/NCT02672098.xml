  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I prospective study with the primary objective to compare the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of Surgical cytoreduction (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC)&#xD;
      in treatment of recurrent ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancers. Eligible&#xD;
      patients consenting to this protocol will undergo their scheduled surgical procedure. After&#xD;
      surgical cytoreduction to a residual disease ≤ 2.5 mm, a single dose of carboplatin (800&#xD;
      mg/m2) will be administered in normal saline via intraperitoneal hyperthermic perfusion using&#xD;
      the closed-abdomen. HIPEC will be continued for 90 minutes in the hyperthermic phase&#xD;
      (41°C-43°C). At 4-6 weeks after CRS, patients will go on to receive 6 cycles of standard IV&#xD;
      platinum-based chemotherapy. The proportion of patients who are without evidence of&#xD;
      recurrence will be assessed at 6, 9, 12 and 18 months after the day of surgery.&#xD;

      This is a phase I prospective study with the primary objective to compare the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of CRS and HIPEC. The target population for this study is patients with ovarian,&#xD;
      primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancers undergoing secondary CRS after the first&#xD;
      platinum-sensitive recurrence. 'Platinum-sensitive' recurrence is defined as recurrence 6&#xD;
      months after the completion of the primary platinum-based chemotherapy. Carboplatin,&#xD;
      delivered as HIPEC, will be administered at the time of surgery. Subjects will receive a&#xD;
      single cycle of hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy. Patients will then go on to&#xD;
      receive standard platinum-based combination doublet chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel,&#xD;
      carboplatin and gemcitabine, or carboplatin and liposomal doxorubicin) for 6 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients consenting to this protocol will undergo their scheduled surgical&#xD;
      procedure. After surgical cytoreduction to a residual disease ≤ 2.5 mm, a single dose of&#xD;
      carboplatin (800 mg/m2) will be administered in normal saline via intraperitoneal&#xD;
      hyperthermic perfusion using the closed-abdomen technique (43). HIPEC will be continued for&#xD;
      90 minutes in the hyperthermic phase (41°C-43°C). At 4-6 weeks after CRS, patients will go on&#xD;
      to receive 6 cycles of standard IV platinum-based chemotherapy. Surveillance CT Chest,&#xD;
      abdomen and pelvis with IV and oral contrast and serum CA-125 levels will be obtained at 6,&#xD;
      9, 12 and 18 months after the day of surgery. Recurrence-free survival will be assessed using&#xD;
      RECIST 1.1 guideline (version 1.1).&#xD;
