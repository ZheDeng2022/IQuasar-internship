      The investigators propose to determine whether listening to classical music during a sedation&#xD;
      procedure decreases the need for procedural sedation medication. It is a two arm study&#xD;
      comparing music vs no music by headphones so that the investigator is blinded to the&#xD;
      intervention. The outcome variable is amount of sedative used and self-reported anxiety level&#xD;
      as reported on a 10 point visual analogue scale (VAS). The music intervention is begun 1&#xD;
      minute prior to the sedation procedure and continued until the subject is completely awake.&#xD;
      Demographics will be collected for all patients. No identifiers are collected. Data will be&#xD;
      compared for a change in VAS variable using non parametric methods.&#xD;

      1. Objectives -The purpose of this study is to compare the amount of sedative (ketamine,&#xD;
           propofol, ketofol, benzodiazepines, narcotics, or any other medications) used in&#xD;
           procedural sedation of patients undergoing fracture reductions in the emergency&#xD;
           department, as well as the amount of anxiety as measured by State-Trait Anxiety&#xD;
           Inventory (STAI), in two groups: patients who listen to classical music during the&#xD;
           procedure versus patients who do not listen to music during the procedure. The&#xD;
           investigators hypothesize that patients who listen to classical music during procedural&#xD;
           sedation will require lower amounts of sedatives and analgesia during the procedure and&#xD;
           report lower levels of anxiety compared to patients who do not listen to classical&#xD;
           music.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Background- Music has been used to reduce anxiety and the experience of pain during&#xD;
           medical procedures and can reduce the requirements for sedation in particular&#xD;
           procedures. One study looked at 100 patients who were undergoing interventional&#xD;
           radiological procedures. After randomizing the participants in a 1:1 ratio, it was found&#xD;
           that sedation was required in 42% of the patients in the music group compared to 60% of&#xD;
           patients in the control group. Also, the mean dosage of midazolam was significantly less&#xD;
           in the music group compared to the control group. This demonstrated a significant&#xD;
           reduction in sedation requirements for patients who had self-selected music playing&#xD;
           during interventional radiological procedures. Music effectively made the procedure&#xD;
           safer by reducing the need for sedation and further contributed to the experience of the&#xD;
           patient. Procedural sedation is used in the UNM Hospital (UNMH) Emergency Department&#xD;
           (ED) on a regular basis to help patients tolerate orthopedic reductions of simple,&#xD;
           closed fractures without needing to go through general anesthesia. This project is&#xD;
           designed to use music therapy in an attempt to augment the effects of procedural&#xD;
           sedation. Our investigation proposes to study whether music therapy as an adjunct to&#xD;
           sedation decreases the amount of sedatives and analgesics used in orthopedic patients&#xD;
           undergoing procedural sedation, and whether these patients report less anxiety by having&#xD;
           music as an adjunct. Music therapy during procedures has been shown to be cost effective&#xD;
           - it reduces patient sedation, procedural times, and number of staff members necessary&#xD;
           to be present during procedures. Music therapy may also be effective in reducing anxiety&#xD;
           in patients undergoing surgery with regional anesthesia: In a group of 80 patients&#xD;
           assigned to an experimental and a control group, anxiety was significantly reduced in&#xD;
           the experimental group who listened to music using headphones throughout the surgery.&#xD;
           According to two systematic reviews, music therapy significantly improving pain scores,&#xD;
           satisfaction scores, anxiety scores, heart rate, and arterial pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study-Wide Number of Subjects- Maximum target enrollment for each group will be 30&#xD;
           subjects, with a total of 60 subjects for project.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Study Timelines- In the experimental group, this music will be started 1 minute prior to&#xD;
           conscious sedation and continued until the patient's sedation wears off and patient is&#xD;
           again interactive with investigator. The study will take approximately 15 minutes of the&#xD;
           patient's time, divided between time before the procedure and time after the procedure.&#xD;
           The duration anticipated to enroll all study subjects is difficult to anticipate, as the&#xD;
           UNMH ED receives as many as one conscious sedation patient a day and as few as one a&#xD;
           week. However, the duration is anticipated to take less than two years. Once data&#xD;
           collection has closed, it will take researchers no longer than one year to complete&#xD;
           primary analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Study Endpoints -The study endpoint will be reached when a total of 60 patients (30&#xD;
           experimental group and 30 in the control group) have been enrolled. There are no primary&#xD;
           or secondary safety endpoints as there is no medical procedure or drug involved in this&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Procedures Involved -Participants will be randomized into the intervention or control&#xD;
           group. The intervention will be listening to a classical song. In the experimental&#xD;
           group, this music will be started 1 minute prior to conscious sedation and continued&#xD;
           until the patient's sedation wears off and patient is again interactive with&#xD;
           investigator. The music will be played using an Appleâ„¢ IPOD player attached to&#xD;
           headphones. During hours when study recruiters are available, all patients between 18-65&#xD;
           years of age presenting to the adult ED at UNMH and needing an orthopedic reduction with&#xD;
           procedural sedation will be invited to participate. If a patient agrees to participate,&#xD;
           a research associate will collect patient's background information (age, sex, type of&#xD;
           fracture, location of fracture, etc.) and then administer the STAI scale. Subjects will&#xD;
           be assigned to either the control or experimental group by flip of coin. Subjects will&#xD;
           then undergo sedation and reduction, with research associate recording the doses of&#xD;
           sedatives and analgesics used, at the times of push. Once patient returns to baseline,&#xD;
           research associate will remove headphones and administer the STAI scale once again.&#xD;
           Demographic information (age, sex, type of fracture, location of fracture, etc.), STAI&#xD;
           scale scores, and the amount of sedatives and analgesics administered during the&#xD;
           procedure. Please see data collection form attachment for a comprehensive list.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of Subjects- The investigators are&#xD;
           creating a Data and Safety Monitoring Plan for this study as the study is considered&#xD;
           more than minimal risk by the investigational review board (IRB). The plan consists of&#xD;
           monitoring the study for any adverse events incurred from subjects' participation in the&#xD;
           study. Dr. Steven Weiss (also in Emergency Medicine) will head the management team.&#xD;
           Every 6 months the investigators will evaluate the progress of the study, address any&#xD;
           adverse events and create a report of any findings. At the yearly IRB renewal the&#xD;
           investigator will include this report with the progress report. The endpoint will be&#xD;
           when all subjects are recruited in the study, anticipated to take 18-24 months.&#xD;
