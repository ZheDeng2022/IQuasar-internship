  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a multi-center, randomized, surgical trial of women with symptomatic&#xD;
      post-hysterectomy apical (cuff) prolapse desiring surgical treatment. This study will compare&#xD;
      the three available surgical treatments performed in usual practice. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to compare two commonly performed mesh apical repair (sacral colpopexy vs. Apical&#xD;
      Transvaginal Mesh) and vaginal native tissue apical repairs with mesh reinforced repairs. The&#xD;
      primary outcome is measured over time (up to 60 months) using a survival analysis approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that treatment failure will not differ between vaginally and&#xD;
      abdominally placed mesh for vault vaginal prolapse, and mesh repairs (regardless of route of&#xD;
      implantation) will be superior to native tissue apical suspension.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this three arm randomized clinical trial is to determine if apical&#xD;
      transvaginal mesh placement is non-inferior to sacral colpopexy for anatomic correction of&#xD;
      post-hysterectomy vaginal vault prolapse and to determine if mesh reinforced repairs&#xD;
      performed by abdominal or vaginal approach are superior to native tissue vaginal repair. This&#xD;
      trial has the following primary aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To determine if Apical Transvaginal Mesh is non-inferior to Sacral Colpopexy for anatomic&#xD;
      correction of post-hysterectomy vaginal vault prolapse at time points through 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1A. In the case where Apical Transvaginal Mesh is shown to be statistically significantly&#xD;
      non-inferior to Sacral Colpopexy for anatomic correction of post-hysterectomy vaginal vault&#xD;
      prolapse at time points through 3 years, to determine if Apical Transvaginal Mesh is superior&#xD;
      to Sacral Colpopexy for anatomic correction of post-hysterectomy vaginal vault prolapse at&#xD;
      time points through 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. To determine if Sacral Colpopexy is superior to Native Tissue Repair for anatomic&#xD;
      correction of post-hysterectomy vaginal vault prolapse at time points through 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. To determine if Apical Transvaginal Mesh is superior to Native Tissue Repair for anatomic&#xD;
      correction of post-hysterectomy vaginal vault prolapse at time points through 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional secondary aims include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the development of a valid and reliable Global Composite Outcome that balances&#xD;
           adverse events and patient-centered outcomes to anatomic definitions of failure and&#xD;
           success.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the impact of preoperative frailty and mobility on surgical treatment outcomes&#xD;
           and postoperative complications of older women following surgical correction of apical&#xD;
           pelvic organ prolapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate the patient's perspective about adverse events and their role in patient&#xD;
           decision-making outcomes. The aims include comparing patient versus surgeon rankings of&#xD;
           complication grade, outcome, expectedness and seriousness, to estimate the association&#xD;
           between patient rankings of adverse events (AEs) with decision-making and quality of&#xD;
           life outcomes and to determine if their perspective about AEs changes over time.&#xD;

Satisfaction with Decision scale (SDS) is a 6-item scale measuring satisfaction with health care decisions, The scale uses a 1-5 rating (1=strongly disagree; 5 = strongly agree).

    <description>Sacral Colpopexy is a surgery performed either through an incision in the abdomen or through several small incisions with the help of a laparoscope (a slender tube) or robot. The surgery is done with a permanent synthetic (man-made) mesh. The mesh is sutured (stitched) to the vagina and sacrum (tail bone) and is used as reinforcement. It provides additional support to weakened tissues and/or muscles.</description>

    <description>Transvaginal Mesh Repair is a surgery performed with an incision through the vagina (transvaginal). The surgery is done with a permanent synthetic (man-made) mesh. The mesh is attached to ligaments in the pelvis and is used to reinforce natural tissue and/or muscles, which are no longer able to provide support to the vagina.</description>
