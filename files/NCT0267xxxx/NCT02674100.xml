    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to create a registry to provide insight into treatment selection&#xD;
      and treatment outcome of pancreatic IRE in order to develop an evidence base such that&#xD;
      physicians can provide the best possible care to patients with pancreatic cancer requiring&#xD;
      surgical interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators seek a better understanding of the uses of ablation in the treatment of&#xD;
      unresectable soft tissue pancreatic tumors and the limitations, concerns and complications&#xD;
      that earlier users have.&#xD;

      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale for creating this multi-center clinical database is to optimally collect&#xD;
      clinical and pathological data on patients with neoplasms in order to facilitate future&#xD;
      clinical observational and outcomes-based research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be considered eligible for inclusion into the database if they meet the&#xD;
      following eligibility criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence/suspicion of Pancreatic neoplasm ≥ 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria Patients will be considered ineligible for inclusion into the database if&#xD;
      they are not able to give consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion of Women, Minorities and Vulnerable Subjects This protocol will include women and&#xD;
      minority populations. Vulnerable subjects (prisoners, children, mentally disabled persons)&#xD;
      will not be included in the study population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Study Objective(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
      To provide insight in treatment selection and treatment outcome of Pancreatic IRE in order to&#xD;
      develop an evidence base such that physicians can provide the best possible care to patients&#xD;
      with Pancreatic cancer requiring surgical intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Study Objective(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
      To provide data on adverse events and complications related to IRE treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The AHPBA will be responsible for data collection and will periodically audit the data for&#xD;
      quality assurance purposes. The AHPBA will review outcomes reported by each participating&#xD;
      Research Institution and if outcomes are in the lower percentile, the investigators will be&#xD;
      offered support to analyze the reasons for the suboptimal outcomes and may seek support to&#xD;
      improve outcomes. The participating Research Institutions will receive a certificate annually&#xD;
      that acknowledges their participation in the Research Project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goal and Aims of Registry?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Specific Aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gain a better understanding of the uses of ablation in the treatment of unresectable&#xD;
           soft tissue pancreatic tumors&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Understand the limitations, concerns, and complications that earlier users of ablation&#xD;
           in the treatment of unresectable soft tissue pancreatic tumors have&#xD;
&#xD;
      Create a multi-institutional group that will both enroll in this registry study, but more&#xD;
      importantly enroll in future, prospective ablation in the treatments of unresectable soft&#xD;
      tissue pancreatic tumors studies. Any patient undergoing a soft tissue ablation may be&#xD;
      included in this study. To confirm, you will always own your data and the registry will be&#xD;
      used as data storage until you release your data for evaluation on a project-by-project&#xD;
      basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What Patients are Eligible?&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Any patient to which the treating physician believes that ablation of their soft tissue&#xD;
      would be feasible in the care of their disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who can be followed and can provide outcome data to achieve the Goals and Aims of&#xD;
      the Registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To participate, the only thing we need to obtain from your site is a regulatory approval&#xD;
      letter stating that it is acceptable to collaborate with your patients de-identified data&#xD;
      (sample data collection protocol is attached) and that you will be consenting your patients&#xD;
      to this data collaboration (The Registry).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Case report forms/ data collection sheets are attached The data entry will be web based. All&#xD;
      treatments must be entered-not just the first treatment. All follow up-up to 2 years or until&#xD;
      death of patient-must be entered. Common follow up is every 3-4 months for first year and&#xD;
      every 6 months for second year. In order to ensure data accuracy we require that, for the&#xD;
      first 5 patients entered, the data sheets and their supporting documentation (de-identified&#xD;
      labs, treatment dictation, etc.) be sent to us so we can make sure the data entry is correct&#xD;
      and complete (e.g., lesion dimensions, measures of response or progression, etc.).&#xD;
