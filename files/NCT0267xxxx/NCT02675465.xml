    <textblock>
      This study is an international, multi-center, study of Pompe disease patients that are&#xD;
      currently receiving enzyme-replacement therapy (ERT). The purpose of this study is to find&#xD;
      out if the co-administration of investigational new drugs ATB200 and AT2221 is safe in adults&#xD;
      with Pompe disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, fixed-sequence, ascending-dose, first-in-human study to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of a highly targeted rhGAA (ATB200) co-administered with a chaperone (AT2221).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics (PD), and immunogenicity of&#xD;
      ATB200 co-administered with AT2221. The study will be conducted in 3 stages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Stage 1, safety, tolerability, and PK will be evaluated following sequential single&#xD;
      ascending doses of intravenously infused ATB200.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Stage 2, safety, tolerability, and PK will be evaluated following single- and&#xD;
      multiple-ascending dose combinations of ATB200 and AT2221.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Stage 3, long term safety and efficacy will be assessed following 24 month treatment of&#xD;
      ATB200 co-administered with AT2221 (Miglustat)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Stage 4, treatment period will begin at the end of Stage 3 and will continue as open label&#xD;
      extension until commercialization, study discontinuation or subject withdrawal, with&#xD;
      functional assessments every 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      No Muscle biopsies will be performed in this study.&#xD;
