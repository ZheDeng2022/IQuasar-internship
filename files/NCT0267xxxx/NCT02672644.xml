    <textblock>
      Study is designed to characterize subject and treating investigator reported outcomes in the&#xD;
      early post-treatment period, following bilateral correction of nasolabial folds using Emervel&#xD;
      Classic and Emervel Deep.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to evaluate subject-reported return to social engagement, after the initial treatment&#xD;
           (Baseline/Day 1 visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to evaluate change in Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS) at day 30-&#xD;
           subject/investigator reported&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to evaluate subject satisfaction with treatment outcome at baseline, day 14 and day 30.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. to evaluate change in Wrinkle Severity Rating Scale (WSRS) from baseline to&#xD;
           post-treatment follow-up time points at day 14 and Day 30 - investigator reported&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. to evaluate all adverse events during the course of the study&#xD;

        Key Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or female subjects, 35 to 60 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Bilateral NLFs: severe (WSRS = 4/4) or moderate (WSRS = 3/3), as assessed by the&#xD;
             treating investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects of childbearing potential who agree to use medically accepted methods of&#xD;
             contraception during the study and for 30 days following study completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Childbearing potential is defined as not being surgically sterile (e.g., hysterectomy,&#xD;
        bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, or tubal ligation) or those who are not post-menopausal&#xD;
        (absence of menstruation for at least 1 year prior to Day 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        - If not surgically sterile or post-menopausal, the subject agrees to use acceptable forms&#xD;
        of contraception. Acceptable methods of contraception are defined as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. use of contraceptive implants or injectables for at least 28 days prior to the start&#xD;
             of the study; or&#xD;

          5. partner with vasectomy at least 3 months prior to study start; or&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. strict abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Subject who presents with a severity of wrinkles or folds that require other&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Previous facial surgery, including aesthetic facial surgical therapy, liposuction or&#xD;
             tattoo, in the treatment area&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Previous tissue revitalisation treatment with laser or light, mesotherapy, chemical&#xD;

             treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject who presents with severe midface volume loss&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subject has a beard or facial hair that, in the investigator's opinion, would&#xD;
