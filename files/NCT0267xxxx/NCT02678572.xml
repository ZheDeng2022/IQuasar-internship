    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate patients who have melanoma that has spread from the eye to the&#xD;
      liver: Patients in the study will be treated with Melphalan/HDS up to 6 total treatment, and&#xD;
      will be followed until death. This study will evaluate the safety and effects of the&#xD;
      treatment on how long patients live and how long it takes for the cancer to advance or&#xD;
      respond to the treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of 3 phases: a screening phase, treatment phase, and follow-up phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Phase: Screening assessments will be conducted within 28 days prior to the&#xD;
      eligibility date to determine each patient's overall eligibility and baseline&#xD;
      characteristics. These assessments will include medical history, physical examination,&#xD;
      Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS), 12 lead electrocardiogram&#xD;
      (ECG), echocardiogram (ECHO), vital signs, full hematology and biochemistry, Quality of Life&#xD;
      questionnaire, radiologic assessments of baseline disease status and concomitant medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients with a history of liver surgery or major vasculature surgery, an angiogram&#xD;
      evaluation of their vasculature will be performed for compatibility for Percutaneous Hepatic&#xD;
      Perfusion (PHP) prior to confirming eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility date: This is the date on which all screening assessments have been completed and&#xD;
      the patient is determined to be eligible for the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Phase: Eligible patients will be treated with Melphalan/HDS 3.0 mg/kg Ideal Body&#xD;
      Weight (IBW) and must begin treatment within 14 days being eligible. Melphalan/HDS treatment,&#xD;
      patients will receive up to 6 treatments. Each treatment cycle consists of 6 weeks with an&#xD;
      acceptable delay for another 2 weeks before the next planned treatment to allow for recovery&#xD;
      of melphalan-related toxicity, if needed. Tumor response will be assessed every 12 weeks (+ 2&#xD;
      weeks) until disease progression. If the patient receives only 1 treatment, the disease&#xD;
      assessment scans will be conducted 12 weeks after the date of the first treatment. The&#xD;
      assessment scans will be reviewed by an Independent Review Committee (IRC), also referred to&#xD;
      as Independent Central Review. At any time when progressive disease (PD) is observed, the&#xD;
      patient will be removed from further study treatment and followed until death. Melphalan/HDS&#xD;
      treatment will also be discontinued in the event that recovery from treatment related&#xD;
      toxicity requires more than 8 weeks from last treatment. An end-of-treatment visit will be&#xD;
      conducted approximately 6 to 8 weeks following the final study treatment. Ongoing treatment&#xD;
      related adverse events (AEs) at the end-of-treatment visit will be followed until the&#xD;
      severity is within one of the following parameters (1) Symptoms are resolved or return to&#xD;
      baseline; (2) CTCAE Grade &lt; 1 or can be explained; (3) patient death. The maximum possible&#xD;
      duration of the study treatment for any patient will be 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: Active Melphalan/HDS patients (currently in treatment) on PHP-OCM-301 will continue&#xD;
      treatment on PHP-OCM-301A following the re-consenting process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: Patients on PHP-OCM-301 that have completed treatment and are entering or are already&#xD;
      in the follow-up phase will be followed-up for survival and disease progression (as&#xD;
      applicable) on PHP-OCM-301A following the re-consenting process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Phase: Once the patient has completed the end-of-treatment (EOT) visit in&#xD;
      accordance with the schedule of events they will enter the follow-up phase. If the disease&#xD;
      has not progressed at the EOT (Section 6.2), the patient will need to continue with disease&#xD;
      assessment visits every 12 weeks (+ 2 weeks) until disease progression is documented. If the&#xD;
      disease has progressed before or at the EOT their follow-up is to be by phone every 3 months&#xD;
      for survival status until death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be monitored, following the completion of study treatment, for the development&#xD;
      of myelodysplasia and secondary leukemia.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or female patients ≥ 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must weigh ≥ 35 kg (due to possible size limitations with respect to&#xD;
             percutaneous catheterization of the femoral artery and vein using the Delcath Hepatic&#xD;
             Delivery System).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. 50% or less histologically or cytologically-proven ocular melanoma metastases in the&#xD;
             parenchyma of the liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Disease in the liver must be measurable by computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic&#xD;
             resonance imaging (MRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Evidence of limited extrahepatic disease on preoperative radiological studies is&#xD;
             acceptable if the life threatening component of disease is in the liver. Limited&#xD;
             extrahepatic disease is defined in this protocol as follows: metastasis in bone,&#xD;
             subcutaneous, lung or lymph nodes that is amenable to resection or radiation and has a&#xD;
             defined treatment plan. Patients with extra-hepatic tumor burden which does not have a&#xD;
             defined treatment plan (i.e. monitor or is unable to be resected or radiated) must not&#xD;
             be included in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Scans used to determine eligibility (CT scan of the chest/abdomen/pelvis and MRI of&#xD;
             the liver) must be performed within 28 days prior to randomization. An MRI of the&#xD;
             liver is required at screening to validate that CT accurately reflects the extent of&#xD;
             disease in the liver. For patients with MRI intolerance, a 3-phase liver CT is to be&#xD;
             done in place of liver MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients must not have chemotherapy, radiotherapy, chemoembolization,&#xD;
             radioembolization, or immunoembolization for their malignancy within 30 days prior to&#xD;
             treatment and must have recovered from all side effects of therapeutic and diagnostic&#xD;
             interventions except those listed in Appendix B of the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients receiving anti programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) immunotherapy such as&#xD;
             pembrolizumab or nivolumab, or human cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 blocking&#xD;
             antibody such as ipilimumab should wait 8 weeks before Melphalan/HDS treatment.&#xD;

             must be ≤ 2.5 x ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patients must have a platelet count &gt; 100,000/µL, hemoglobin ≥ 10.0 gm/dL, white blood&#xD;
             cell count (WBC) &gt; 2,000/uL, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 109/L, and a&#xD;
             serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL unless the measured creatinine clearance is &gt; 40&#xD;
             mL/min/1.73 m2.&#xD;
