    <textblock>
      This Phase 2 open-label, multicenter study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and&#xD;
      efficacy of BMN 190 intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration every other week (qow) for a&#xD;
      period of 144 weeks, in patients with CLN2. The study is designed to assess disease&#xD;
      progression in CLN2 patients treated with BMN 190 compared to natural history data from&#xD;
      untreated historical controls.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BMN 190 is a recombinant form of human tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1), the enzyme deficient&#xD;
      in patients with CLN2 diseases (also known as classical late-infantile CLN2, cLINCL, or&#xD;
      Jansky-Bielschowsky disease), a form of Batten Disease. As an enzyme replacement therapy&#xD;
      (ERT), BMN 190 is designed to help restore TPP1 enzyme activity. BMN 190 is designed to&#xD;
      reduce the progressive, pathologic accumulation of lysosomal storage material. 190-203 is a&#xD;
      Phase 2 open-label, multicenter study that will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and&#xD;
      efficacy of BMN 190 in pediatric patients &lt; 18 years of age with CLN2 disease. Study drug&#xD;
      dosing will be determined by the patient's age and administered via intracerebroventricular&#xD;
      (ICV) infusion every other week (qow), for a duration of 144 weeks.&#xD;
