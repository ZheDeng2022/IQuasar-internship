  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In-hospital pediatric cardiac arrest is an important public health problem affecting almost&#xD;
      6000 children a year in the United States. As many as 3% of patients admitted to a children's&#xD;
      hospital require cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Only a minority of children survive, of&#xD;
      which around 35% go on to have a poor neurological outcome. International consensus&#xD;
      guidelines on science and treatment recommendations for the management of pediatric&#xD;
      resuscitation have existed for decades and are revised periodically by the International&#xD;
      Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) based on available evidence. This consensus is&#xD;
      then used by national councils such as the American Heart Association (AHA) and the Heart and&#xD;
      Stroke Foundation of Canada (HSFC) to make guidelines for care. These guidelines focus on a&#xD;
      structured approach to resuscitation, which emphasizes the rapid implementation of key&#xD;
      interventions such as starting chest compressions, administering epinephrine and&#xD;
      defibrillation. The goal of this study is to improve outcomes after cardiac arrest in&#xD;
      children by improving adherence to consensus guidelines. The investigators aim to achieve&#xD;
      this by conducting a multi-center, prospective, factorial randomized study with participating&#xD;
      sites from the International Network for Simulation-based Pediatric Innovation, Research and&#xD;
      Education (INSPIRE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the effectiveness of knowledge-based cognitive aids, namely the Pediatric&#xD;
           Advanced Life Support (PALS) algorithm cards, in healthcare teams.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the effectiveness of teamwork-based cognitive aids, namely the Cognitive&#xD;
           Aids with Roles Defined (CARD) system, in healthcare teams.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine if there is a synergistic effect when adding the CARD system to the use of&#xD;
           knowledge-based cognitive aids or indeed whether using both these tools together has&#xD;
           unintended consequences and reduces the added value of each technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To identify whether additional simulation-based team training in the use of cognitive&#xD;
           aids results in a significant improvement in performance over an e-learning module.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that (i) knowledge-based cognitive aids will significantly&#xD;
      improve the performance of healthcare teams in providing PALS in a simulated setting, (ii)&#xD;
      that teamwork-based cognitive aids (CARD) will significantly improve the performance of&#xD;
      healthcare teams in providing PALS in a simulated setting, and that (iii) adding the CARD&#xD;
      system to knowledge-based aids will have an added and synergistic effect, (iv) that the team&#xD;
      performance in all study arms will improve after simulation based training, but that the&#xD;
      groups with cognitive aids will continue to out-perform the groups without cognitive aids.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study utilizes a prospective, randomized controlled, factorial study design, which&#xD;
      examines the effect of integrating different elements of cognitive aids for training&#xD;
      pediatric resuscitation team members. Recruited participants will be asked to perform as&#xD;
      members of a multi-professional pediatric resuscitation team. The study uses simulation-based&#xD;
      training as the primary method to evaluate the effect of both knowledge- and team-based&#xD;
      cognitive aids on team performance, as measured by adherence to PALS guidelines. Participants&#xD;
      will be teams of multi-professional pediatric resuscitation healthcare providers (physician,&#xD;
      registered nurse, registered respiratory therapist). All participants will undertake a&#xD;
      pre-test scenario, without access to either cognitive aid, regardless of group allocation.&#xD;
      Participants will then be randomized to one of the four study arms using a list generated by&#xD;
      an independent statistician. Randomization will be stratified by institution so that there&#xD;
      are equal numbers of teams in each study arm in each participating institution of the&#xD;
      multi-center study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In study arm 1 (control), resuscitation teams will participate in a simulated pediatric&#xD;
      cardiac arrest scenario, and provide standard CPR without being provided cognitive aids.&#xD;
      Participants in this group will be allowed to use any cognitive aid that they happen to keep&#xD;
      with them and would normally use in their practice, for example, flash cards or smart phone&#xD;
      apps. In study arm 2 (knowledge-aid), resuscitation teams will participate in the same&#xD;
      scenario without using the CARD system but will be trained in the use of a knowledge-based&#xD;
      cognitive aid, which will be used by a dedicated team member (the cognitive aid &quot;reader&quot;). In&#xD;
      study arm 3 (CARD), participants will be trained to use the cognitive aids with roles defined&#xD;
      (CARD) system but will not be given knowledge-based cognitive aids and there will be no&#xD;
      dedicated cognitive aid reader in the team. In study arm 4 (integrated cognitive aid),&#xD;
      participants will be trained to use the CARD system and also in the use of a protocol-based&#xD;
      cognitive aid, which will be used by a dedicated cognitive aid reader.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All groups will then undertake a 20-minute e-learning module. E-learning modules will be&#xD;
      developed to illustrate the principles of crisis resource management using text, images and&#xD;
      short videos (of simulated scenarios) illustrating high- and low- performance in leadership,&#xD;
      teamwork and task management. For the control group, the content will focus on team training&#xD;
      principles and the PALS algorithm. For the knowledge-aid group, the content will also focus&#xD;
      on team training principles and the PALS algorithm adding an introduction of the principle of&#xD;
      using the knowledge-based cognitive aids provided with a cognitive aid &quot;reader&quot; designated by&#xD;
      the team leader who will use a &quot;do-verify&quot; approach to the cognitive aid. For the CARD group,&#xD;
      the content will also focus on team training principles and the PALS algorithm adding an&#xD;
      introduction of the principles of the CARD system. For the integrated cognitive aid group,&#xD;
      the content will focus on team training principles and the PALS algorithm adding an&#xD;
      introduction of the principles of the CARD system and the principle of using the&#xD;
      knowledge-based cognitive aids provided with a cognitive aid &quot;reader&quot; designated by the team&#xD;
      leader who will use a &quot;do-verify&quot; approach to the cognitive aid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will then undergo a post-test scenario, with cognitive aids provided as per&#xD;
      group allocation. A debriefing will follow in order to delineate the additional effect of&#xD;
      simulation-based learning on the e-module. All study arms will then undertake a&#xD;
      second-post-test scenario, with cognitive aids related to their group allocation followed by&#xD;
      a second debriefing. Participants will be asked to complete a demographic questionnaire and a&#xD;
      questionnaire on the use of cognitive aids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to standardize scenarios between sites, the investigators will script the content of&#xD;
      each scenario, including set transitions from one clinical state to another, programmed&#xD;
      responses to expected interventions, and a pre-set duration. The scenarios will be piloted at&#xD;
      the main study site and videos circulated to all other sites before piloting at those&#xD;
      locations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scenario for assessment (pre-test, post-test 1 and post-test 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      One 12-minute pediatric cardiac arrest resuscitation scenario will be developed to address&#xD;
      PALS-based cognitive and clinical performance, as well as compliance with American Heart&#xD;
      Association guidelines. This scenario has two phases: the first being a non-shockable rhythm&#xD;
      arrest (six minutes) and the second being a shockable rhythm arrest (six minutes). The case&#xD;
      history before the arrest and the exact rhythms will be different in each phase to prevent&#xD;
      over familiarity with the scenarios but the expected management of the arrest is the same in&#xD;
      each to minimize variations in difficulty of scenario from pre-test to post-test:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pre-test: bronchiolitis; pulseless electrical activity/ventricular fibrillation&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Post-test 1: sepsis, pulseless electrical activity/ventricular tachycardia&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Post-test 2: myocarditis; pulseless activity/ventricular tachycardia&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scenario is designed to test clinical performance during both cardiac arrest algorithms.&#xD;
      To ensure consistency in delivery of the scenario between recruitment sites, each site will&#xD;
      be provided with a pre-programmed scenario and a script for the simulation facilitator,&#xD;
      outlining specifically how to run the scenario, how to introduce the patient, and how/when to&#xD;
      provide verbal cues to the resuscitation team. During a pre-study run-in phase, each&#xD;
      recruitment center will have to conduct and transmit 2 successful case scenarios using this&#xD;
      format to the research coordinating center. This will allow the investigators to confirm&#xD;
      adequate quality of audiovisual content and sound before the site is allowed to conduct and&#xD;
      submit data from their site. Videos and data collected during the run-in phase will not be&#xD;
      analyzed for inclusion in the main study. Participants recruited during this phase will not&#xD;
      be eligible for inclusion in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All recruitment sites will utilize the same make/brand of pediatric simulator for this study.&#xD;
      The Laerdal SimBaby is widely used across Canada and the Unites States and is capable of&#xD;
      reproducing physiological responses to medical interventions. This simulator is connected to&#xD;
      a monitor where vital signs (heart rhythm, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, blood&#xD;
      pressure, temperature) are displayed. Through a computer interface, an operator can run&#xD;
      pre-programmed scenarios where vital signs on the monitor and physical findings on the&#xD;
      simulator change in real time. The mannequin is capable of producing heart sounds, breath&#xD;
      sounds and palpable pulses. The simulator can be bag-mask ventilated, the trachea intubated&#xD;
      and the heart defibrillated. Our cardiac arrest scenario will be pre-programmed into the&#xD;
      simulator to ensure consistency between recruitment sites and study groups. The investigators&#xD;
      will ensure as much standardization as possible between centers in the physical environment&#xD;
      for the scenario, including the same availability and location of equipment, including a&#xD;
      similar sized room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Video rating will be by multiple independent raters with expertise in both simulation and&#xD;
      pediatric resuscitation, who will be blinded to the research question. Raters will be trained&#xD;
      in the use of the assessment tools by the primary investigator and co-investigators using&#xD;
      video conferencing technology. The rater training process will consist of (i) a short&#xD;
      tutorial on how to use the rating tools, (ii) each rater independently rating similar&#xD;
      scenarios to those used in the study (which will not be used in the analysis), (iii) a group&#xD;
      discussion of the ratings led by the principle investigator in order to resolve differences&#xD;
      and obtain consensus. Approximately 10% of the videos will be rated in duplicate in order to&#xD;
      establish inter-rater reliability.&#xD;
