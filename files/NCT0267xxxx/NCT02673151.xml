    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to see if recurrent prostate cancer can be identified&#xD;
      using a special procedure called a positron emission tomography (PET) scan. PET/CT is used to&#xD;
      describe information regarding the function, as well as location and size of a tumor.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT for detection of recurrent prostate cancer after initial&#xD;
      therapy in patients with elevated PSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will undergo baseline assessments at enrollment. Study participants&#xD;
      will receive 68Ga PSMA 11 and undergo a PET/CT. Participants will be contacted at 24 to 72&#xD;
      hours following the scan in order to capture potential late occurring Adverse Events.Clinical&#xD;
      follow up of participant at 3 to 12 months following the scan in order to analyze secondary&#xD;
      endpoints.&#xD;

    <measure>Confirmation of Prostate Cancer Recurrence</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Prostate cancer patients with suspected prostate cancer recurrence will be evaluated with 68Ga PSMA 11 PET/CT and conventional imaging. The outcome will be reported as the percentage of participants for whom tumor lesions are identified by 68Ga PSMA 11 PET/CT, and for whom tumor lesions are identified by histopathology/biopsy and/or conventional imaging follow up. The outcome is reported as percentages without dispersion.</description>

    <measure>Sensitivity of 68GA-PSMA PET/CT</measure>

    <description>Point estimates and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated. Sites of suspected metastatic disease will be graded on a three-point scale (0=Negative, 1=Equivocal, 2=Positive), with statistical analysis performed with equivocal score of 1 graded as positive or negative on two separate analysis, for a more sensitive or specific visual read, respectively.</description>

    <measure>68Ga PSMA 11 PET/CT Predictive Value by Participant</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>: The predictive value of 68Ga PSMA 11 PET/CT for detection of tumor, as confirmed by conventional imaging follow up and/or histopathology/biopsy, within the following 1 year, is assessed by participant. Positive predictive value (PPV) is the probability that participants identified by 68Ga PSMA 11 PET/CT as having prostate cancer recurrence, do have prostate cancer recurrence. Negative predictive value (NPV) is the probability that participants not identified by 68Ga PSMA 11 PET/CT as having prostate cancer recurrence, do not have prostate cancer recurrence. The outcome is reported as the PPV and the NPV of 68Ga PSMA 11 PET/CT for confirmation of prostate cancer recurrence by participant, with 95% confidence interval.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>68Ga PSMA 11 PET/CT Predictive Value by Region</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>: The predictive value of 68Ga PSMA 11 PET/CT for detection of tumor location, as confirmed by conventional imaging follow up and/or histopathology/biopsy, within the following 1 year, is assessed by region [prostate bed; pelvis outside of prostate bed including lymph nodes; extrapelvic soft tissue; lymph nodes; and organ metastases (non bone); and bone metastases]. Negative predictive value (NPV) is the probability that participants not identified by 68Ga PSMA 11 PET/CT as having prostate cancer recurrence, do not have prostate cancer recurrence. The outcome is reported as the PPV and the NPV of 68Ga PSMA 11 PET/CT for confirmation of prostate cancer recurrence by region, with 95% confidence interval.</description>
