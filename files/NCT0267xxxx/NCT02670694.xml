      This study will investigate sleep behavior in subjects with Angelman Syndrome, Rett Syndrome&#xD;
      or Prader-Willi Syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also investigate sleep behavior in healthy siblings of subjects with Angelman&#xD;
      Syndrome, Rett Syndrome or Prader-Willi Syndrome. These individuals will serve as control&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will use questionnaires designed to identify sleep disorders and how they affect&#xD;
      behavior and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal goals of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To see how common sleep disorders are in individuals with Angelman Syndrome, Rett&#xD;
           Syndrome or Prader-Willi Syndrome;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To see how sleep disorders affect behavior in these individuals;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To see whether sleep disorders and related behavior problems improve or worsen with age;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To see how specific disease conditions relate to sleep disorders and how bad the sleep&#xD;
           disorders are;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To develop new treatment options to improve quality of life and behavior issues; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To evaluate current treatment options to improve sleep problems in these individuals.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with AS, RTT or PWS and normal siblings (controls) will be recruited for study&#xD;
      participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be recruited from the Rare Disease Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) consortium&#xD;
      registries for AS, RTT and PWS. The RDCRN registries provide listings of individuals&#xD;
      currently enrolled in the RDCRN along with clinical and genetic diagnosis, medical history&#xD;
      and contact information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RDCRN consortium sites for AS, RTT and PWS will participate in the study. These sites&#xD;
      will recruit study participants, obtain informed consent and administer the sleep&#xD;
      questionnaires. Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval will be obtained at each RDCRN&#xD;
      consortium site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Subjects&quot; is defined as those children with a diagnosis of AS, PWS, and RTT. Subjects will&#xD;
      be divided into separate study arms based upon their medical diagnosis. Study arms will&#xD;
      consist of: 1) AS group, 2) PWS group, 3) RTT group, and 4) control group. &quot;Control group&quot; is&#xD;
      defined as normal healthy siblings of subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants and parents/guardians will be asked to complete the study questionnaires&#xD;
      during the clinic visit. The questionnaires are brief and should not be difficult to&#xD;
      complete. It is anticipated that the questionnaires can be completed in 15-30 minutes. If&#xD;
      parents are unable to complete the questionnaires at the time of their scheduled clinic visit&#xD;
      they will be asked to take the questionnaires home to complete and to mail them back to the&#xD;
      research team. When the research team receives the returned questionnaires they will be&#xD;
      reviewed for completion. If questions are skipped or left blank, a member of the research&#xD;
      team will call the family to complete the missed questions over the phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents/guardians are allowed to answer the questions on behalf of the study participants and&#xD;
      will be asked to answer all the questions for each age-appropriate questionnaire in order for&#xD;
      the responses to be scored correctly. Subjects with AS, RTT and PWS and normal siblings will&#xD;
      complete the same questionnaire forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be administered the questionnaires again in 12-24 months at a&#xD;
      follow-up RDCRN clinic visit or by mail to assess the natural history of their sleep behavior&#xD;
      and any sleep disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants identified as having a potential severe sleep disorder based on&#xD;
      questionnaire responses will be contacted or sent a letter by the study investigators and&#xD;
      advised to see a sleep specialist for further evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential &quot;Subjects&quot; must be members of the RDCRN consortium registries with available&#xD;
      contact and clinical diagnostic information on file. These individuals will be invited to&#xD;
      participate in the study at their next regularly scheduled RDCRN visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study recruitment will continue for one year. Subjects with a clinical diagnosis of AS, RTT&#xD;
      or PWS, or normal siblings of these individuals will be recruited for study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size of study participants, including controls, will be based upon the number of&#xD;
      individuals currently enrolled in the RDCRN consortium registries. Currently the combined&#xD;
      number of individuals in the AS, RTT and PWS RDCRN consortium registries is 1082. The&#xD;
      breakdown by disorder is: 678 RTT, 172 AS, 141 PWS. Final sample size will be the total&#xD;
      number of subjects consented during the one year recruitment period. A projected enrollment&#xD;
      total would be approximately 1,000 total individuals ( 500 subjects including 300 RTT, 100&#xD;
      AS, 100 PWS &amp; 500 controls).&#xD;
