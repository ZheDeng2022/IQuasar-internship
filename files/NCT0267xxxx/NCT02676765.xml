  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if sublingual allergen immunotherapy tablets work&#xD;
      by inducing a state of desensitization in mast cells and basophils.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To induce clinical tolerance, a failure to respond to an allergen to which one was previously&#xD;
      responsive, is an important objective for physicians, one that plays a significant role in&#xD;
      the primary prevention of allergic reactions in the clinical practice of Allergy &amp;&#xD;
      Immunology. The tolerance resulting after standard subcutaneous immunotherapy to aeroallergen&#xD;
      and insect venom allergens is long lasting and allergen-specific, and may involve&#xD;
      antigen-specific T regulatory cells. In contrast, tolerance resulting from drug&#xD;
      desensitization protocols is short-lived, and postulated to target mast cells and basophils.&#xD;
      Research into the cellular and biochemical processes by which desensitization occurs has&#xD;
      revealed that mast cells desensitized to one antigen in vitro, under certain conditions, lose&#xD;
      the ability to degranulate to unrelated antigens or to direct FcεRI cross-linking.&#xD;
      Preliminary data suggests that this cross-desensitization can happen in patients undergoing&#xD;
      incremental desensitization, depending in part on the percentage of IgE targeted to the&#xD;
      allergen used for desensitization. This proposal therefore aims to explore desensitization&#xD;
      and cross-desensitization in human volunteers undergoing standard sublingual (SL)&#xD;
      immunotherapy to grass or ragweed pollen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo SL immunotherapy with either Timothy or Short Ragweed tablets, taking&#xD;
      one tablet per day, or will take a placebo tablet. Titration skin testing to Timothy or Short&#xD;
      Ragweed, to one or preferably two additional allergens to which the subject is sensitive, and&#xD;
      to codeine as a control for mast cell activation capability through a non-IgE-dependent&#xD;
      pathway will be performed to determine the PC3 value (see below). Skin testing, including&#xD;
      histamine and diluent controls, will be performed prior to and at one and four weeks after&#xD;
      initiation of immunotherapy. At each time point, blood will be obtained to measure total and&#xD;
      antigen-specific IgE levels, tryptase and cytokine levels, and basophil activation with the&#xD;
      relevant allergens and C5a as a non-IgE-mediated control for basophil activation.&#xD;
