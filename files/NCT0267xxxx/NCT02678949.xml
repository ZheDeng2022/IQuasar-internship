    <textblock>
      The multiple breath washout (MBW) is one of pulmonary function test that displays flow and&#xD;
      gas concentration plotted against time, and shows an exponential decay in end-tidal gas&#xD;
      concentration (washout curve). A number of of indices to describe the washout curve have been&#xD;
      proposed, the most commonly reported is the Lung Clearance Index (LCI). This is a simple&#xD;
      measure of ventilation heterogeneity derived from MBW, that can be used after challenge with&#xD;
      a short action bronchodilator and in response to inhaled steroids, both in the conductive&#xD;
      airways as acinar. Patients with moderate and severe asthma are characterized by an&#xD;
      abnormality in both, conductive and the acinar airway. Therefore the following research&#xD;
      question could be: what are the abnormalities in the heterogeneity of ventilation in children&#xD;
      with mild and moderate asthma, with respect to the healthy population measured by MBW, and&#xD;
      whether these alterations persist after challenge with inhaled steroids and B2 agonists&#xD;
      short-acting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The method most used to measure lung function, have been the spirometric tests, which&#xD;
      generally reflect the function of the airway of highest caliber and elastic retraction of the&#xD;
      lung. However, its use in clinical practice is limited by physiological variability and&#xD;
      inconsistency in the measurements, therefore its value as a predictor of peripheral&#xD;
      obstruction has been questioned. The Lung Clearance Index (LCI) is a simple measure of&#xD;
      ventilation heterogeneity derived from multiple breath-washout (MBW) curve, that can be used&#xD;
      after challenge with a short action bronchodilator and inhaled steroids, both in the&#xD;
      conductive and acinar airways. Patients with moderate and severe asthma are characterized by&#xD;
      an abnormality in both, conductive and the acinar airway. The LCI is one index derived from&#xD;
      the concentration curves obtained during MBW to quantify the inefficiency in gas mixing of&#xD;
      the lungs. A phase III slope analysis of the MBW curve can distinguish maldistribution of&#xD;
      ventilation due to structural changes (acinar vs conductive lung zone). The conductive MBW&#xD;
      index of ventilation heterogeneity is related to proximal lung structure, where convection&#xD;
      dominates gas transport. The acinar MBW index of ventilation heterogeneity is related to&#xD;
      peripheral lung, where convection-diffusion interaction occurs. Therefore the following&#xD;
      research question could be: what are the abnormalities in the heterogeneity of ventilation in&#xD;
      pediatric patients with a diagnosis of asthma, both mild and moderate, with respect to the&#xD;
      healthy population, measured by MBW and whether these alterations persist using conventional&#xD;
      treatment with inhaled steroids and B2 agonists short-acting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general objetive will be to identify changes in the LCI (heterogeneity of ventilation)&#xD;
      retrieved from the MBW curve in children with diagnosis of mild and moderate asthma, before&#xD;
      and after challenge with short-acting B2 agonists and after one month of treatment with&#xD;
      knowledge dose of inhaled steroid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. . Difference in the baseline results of spirometry and LCI (derived form the MBW curve),&#xD;
           between the control health group, and children with mild and moderate asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. . Changes in LCI (acinar or conductive ventilation heterogeneity) obtained from the MBW&#xD;
           curve, from the baseline values and after challenge with short-acting B2 agonist and&#xD;
           with inhaled steroids between groups of patients with mild or moderate asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. . Determine whether the alterations in the LCI of patients with mild and moderate asthma&#xD;
           are originated from acinar or from the conductive airway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology. The LCI is calculated with the cumulative volume exhaled (CVE) during MBW test,&#xD;
      divided between the functional residual capacity (FRC). This index is the number of turnovers&#xD;
      of lung volume that the patient must breathe to clean the lungs of tracer gas (1/40th of the&#xD;
      initial concentration). The expiratory N2 concentration will be plotted against volume&#xD;
      changes between Total Lung Capacity (TLC) and Residual Volume (RV), and the slope (dN2) of&#xD;
      the N2 alveolar plateau will be calculated by computer analysis of the best-fit line through&#xD;
      phase III of the expiratory volume-concentration curve. The measurements will be accepted&#xD;
      only if the vital capacity (VC) during the MBW is within 10% of the VC. During the MBW test,&#xD;
      patients most perform a slow, full inspiratory and expiratory VC maneuver at inspiratory and&#xD;
      expiratory flow rates of approximately 0.5 l/s.The VC will be obtained from the spirometry&#xD;
      test.&#xD;
&#xD;

      normality and to compare the results of the spirometry and the LCI derived from the MBW curve&#xD;

      Sample size; Taking into account the magnitude of the effect on the LCI during the MBW in&#xD;
      pediatric subjects with asthma, pre and postbronchodilation on the basis of clinical studies&#xD;
      carried out previously (Singer F, Abbas Ch, Yammine S, Casaulta C, Frey U, Latzin P. Abnormal&#xD;
      small airway function in children with mild asthma.) Chest 2014; 145 (3): 492-499). Where the&#xD;

&#xD;
      Selection of patients for the sample and its distribution; 3 groups of patients will be&#xD;
      included: Group 1) Healthy group (controls). Group 2) Patients with mild asthma in treatment&#xD;
