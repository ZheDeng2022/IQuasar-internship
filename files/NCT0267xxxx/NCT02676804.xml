  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, pre-post intervention study to evaluate the effect of a&#xD;
      high-intensity, aerobic exercise program on outcomes of cognition, mood, gait, balance,&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory fitness, neuromuscular performance, fatigue, sleep, and quality of life for&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with idiopathic Parkinson disease. The primary outcomes will be a&#xD;
      composite measure of cognitive function and the Timed Up and Go (TUG).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      All subjects will be assigned to aerobic exercise that will use a blend of both unsupervised&#xD;
      moderate and supervised high intensity exercise. The exercise will consist of walking /&#xD;
      jogging modalities, dependent on the individual's level of bradykinesia and will be paced by&#xD;
      the individual's level of perceived exertion. The exercise protocol will be designed to&#xD;
      target an accumulation of at least 150 minutes of cardiovascular exercise per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise training will be performed 5x/week for a total of 16 weeks. The training will&#xD;
      consist of 3 supervised high intensity sessions and 2 at home moderate intensity exercise&#xD;
      sessions. The high intensity sessions will be performed on a treadmill at an intensity rating&#xD;
      of ~ 15 and 17 on a rating of perceived exertion (RPE) scale of 6 to 20. The moderate&#xD;
      intensity exercise will target an RPE of ~10 - 12 and participants will be asked to complete&#xD;
      this on their own.&#xD;
