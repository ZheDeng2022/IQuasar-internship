  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to analyze the way the human body responds to a temporary lack of oxygen, or&#xD;
      ischaemia. Prospective participants will complete a health screen to confirm overall health /&#xD;
      low cardiovascular risk profile.The participants will be required to have pneumatic blood&#xD;
      pressure cuff inflation to 200mmHg on the upper arm for 5 minutes which will then be deflated&#xD;
      for 5 minutes and then repeating the cycle of inflation and deflation a further 3 times.&#xD;
      Blood tests from veins in the forearm would be taken before, during, and after this is done&#xD;
      in order to compare results and establish any change in concentration of local and&#xD;
      circulating compounds.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Evidence exists that short periods of ischaemia (lack of oxygen delivered to tissue in the&#xD;
      body) can protect a local or remote area of the body from subsequent prolonged periods of&#xD;
      serious ischaemia. It has been shown that substances are released into the circulation after&#xD;
      short periods of ischaemia that may cause this protection. This study aims to identify some&#xD;
      of these compounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After participants are informed about the study and have an opportunity to ask questions,&#xD;
      informed consent will be obtained. Following this, a modified Exercise and Sports Science&#xD;
      Australia questionnaire and brief medical history will be obtained. Blood pressure readings,&#xD;
      height, weight and waist circumference would be measured. This is to establish a picture of&#xD;
      overall general health and cardiovascular risk profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those who meet the study eligibility criteria will proceed on a subsequent day to the blood&#xD;
      pressure cuff inflation protocol. Consumption of caffeine or alcohol cannot be consumed&#xD;
      within 4 hours prior to the protocol and participants must minimise any physical activity in&#xD;
      the 4 hours prior to the protocol. After resting for 15 minutes on arrival, a baseline venous&#xD;
      blood test will be taken from the dominant arm. A standard pneumatic blood pressure cuff will&#xD;
      be placed around the non-dominant upper arm and inflated to 200mmHg for 5 minutes. The cuff&#xD;
      will then be deflated completely for 5 minutes. This cycle will be repeated a further 3&#xD;
      times, with each cycle commencing as soon as the previous one has been completed. At the end&#xD;
      of the final deflation, a second venous blood sample will be taken from the arm with the&#xD;
      cuff. 10 minutes after this, a final venous blood test will be taken from the dominant arm.&#xD;
      Blood samples will be processed and stored appropriately until analysed by mass spectrometry.&#xD;
      Changes in compounds in the cuffed limb and the opposite limb from the baseline blood sample&#xD;
      will be analysed.&#xD;
