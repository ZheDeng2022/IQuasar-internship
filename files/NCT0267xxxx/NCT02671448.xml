  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators plan to see what happens when a person receives care in the&#xD;
      home setting. They want to find out if caring for a patient who has been treated with an ASCT&#xD;
      in the home setting is feasible. They want to find out what effects good and/or bad this will&#xD;
      have on the patient's recovery and treatment after ASCT. Studies in other institutions have&#xD;
      shown that providing care in the home setting after ASCT is safe, increases patient&#xD;
      satisfaction, and can decrease the risk of infection. It is our hope that this new approach&#xD;
      of providing care in the home setting will prove to be a feasible and safe option for&#xD;
      patients at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK).&#xD;
