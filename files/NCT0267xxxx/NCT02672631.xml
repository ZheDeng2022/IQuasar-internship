      The aim of this study is to determine whether clinical, sensory and motor development&#xD;
      correlated with the values obtained from Electroneuromyography and DTI in postoperative&#xD;
      follow up patients who underwent primary repair after the total median nerve injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Median nerve is one of three major nerves of hand and forearm and often injure with glass&#xD;
      etc, in follow up of healing; clinical examination and ENMG are often used. Both of these&#xD;
      methods are subjective, noninvasive and objective new method is required. In this context;&#xD;
      differences between intact, recovering and not healed nerve tissue's diffusions have led to&#xD;
      the hypothesis; &quot;The recovery of the repaired nerve tissue can be monitored by Diffusion&#xD;
      Tensor Imaging method&quot;.&#xD;

      The aim of this study is to determine whether clinical, sensory and motor development&#xD;
      correlated with the values obtained from Electroneuromyography and DTI in postoperative&#xD;
      follow up patients who underwent primary repair after the total median nerve injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Median nerve is one of three major nerves of hand and forearm. It is below flexor tendon and&#xD;
      retinaculum at the level of the wrist and often injured at this level and subtotally. The&#xD;
      primary microsurgical suture technique under a microscope is the gold standard treatment. In&#xD;
      follow up of healing; clinical examination and ENMG are often used. Both of these methods are&#xD;
      subjective, although ENMG is more objective, however that is an invasive method, and need&#xD;
      experienced neurologists. So, noninvasive and objective new method is required. In this&#xD;
      context; differences between intact, recovering and not healed nerve tissue's diffusions have&#xD;
      led to the hypothesis; &quot;The recovery of the repaired nerve tissue can be monitored by&#xD;
      Diffusion Tensor Imaging method&quot;. There is no similar study in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten patients who were operated for median nerve injuries in 2014 will be enrolled. In the&#xD;
      sample, correlations between Tinnel Test, motor strength assessment (Medical Research Council&#xD;
      (MRC) Scale), static two-point discrimination test (S2PD), Semmes-Weinstein (SW) monofilament&#xD;
      test, the Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) test, EMG with the DTI results will&#xD;
      be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study; it is expected that a significant correlation between conventional&#xD;
      methods and DTI. If the results support the hypothesis; DTI may get to the literature as&#xD;
      noninvasive and objective method in follow of nerve regeneration.&#xD;
