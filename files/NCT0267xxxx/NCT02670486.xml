      Many women have the need to run to the restroom frequently during the night and day, a&#xD;
      condition called &quot;overactive bladder&quot;. Embarrassing urinary leakage is also commonly&#xD;
      associated with these symptoms. The investigators believe the primary cause in most cases is&#xD;
      the bladder muscle contracting too frequently but are still not sure exactly why this happens&#xD;
      and if it is triggered by factors in the environment. When bladder testing using pressure&#xD;
      catheters (&quot;urodynamics&quot;) is done these bladder contractions are often not picked up, even in&#xD;
      women with overactive bladder. This may be partly due to the unnatural environment in which&#xD;
      the testing is done without the presence of the usual visual or audible triggers, such as&#xD;
      running water or seeing a toilet. The investigators propose adding an audiovisual stimulant&#xD;
      to the usual bladder testing to see if this makes it more likely for bladder contractions to&#xD;
      happen. One group of patients would have the usual bladder testing as part of their normal&#xD;
      care. The other group would receive the normal care in addition to hearing a water fountain&#xD;
      in the room and watching a video of things that may trigger overactive bladder symptoms;&#xD;
      seeing public restroom signs in a mall, a toilet bowl being lowered and a kitchen sink with&#xD;
      water running over dishes. The suspicion is that the proportion of patients in whom bladder&#xD;
      contractions are seen will be higher for those with audiovisual triggers compared to those&#xD;
      with the usual care. Women with overactive bladder or leakage with urge who are sent for&#xD;
      urodynamics by their doctor will be asked if they wish to participate in the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Detrusor overactivity (DO), defined as a rise in detrusor pressure during bladder filling on&#xD;
      urodynamic evaluation (UDE), is presumed to be involved in the pathophysiology of overactive&#xD;
      bladder syndrome (OAB) and urge urinary incontinence (UUI). However, the mechanism of DO is&#xD;
      not fully understood and the detection rate of DO on UDE is low. Currently there is limited&#xD;
      data in the literature investigating audiovisual stimulation of DO. To improve the&#xD;
      understanding of the neural regulation of micturition, the investigators propose adding an&#xD;
      audiovisual stimulant to standard UDE. Methods: 218 women with OAB and/or UUI undergoing UDE&#xD;
      will be recruited. Subjects will be randomized to standard care versus standard care with the&#xD;
      addition of an audiovisual stimulant, involving the patient listening to running water and&#xD;
      watching a video of several well-known triggers. The primary outcome will be proportion of&#xD;
      patients in whom detrusor contractions are seen. Secondary outcomes will include number,&#xD;
      amplitude and length of contractions and presence of incontinence associated with a&#xD;
      contraction. The objective of this study is to estimate the effect of adding audiovisual cues&#xD;
      during UDE on the proportion of patients in whom DO is detected compared to standard clinical&#xD;
      care. The hypothesis is that the proportion of patients in whom detrusor contractions are&#xD;
      seen will be higher in female patients with OAB symptoms and/or UUI using an audiovisual&#xD;
      stimulant. Data obtained will be analyzed by chi square, t-tests, and multivariable logistic&#xD;
      regression analysis as appropriate.&#xD;
