             intolerant to standard therapy, or for whom no standard therapy exists or who are&#xD;
             considered by the investigator to be inappropriate for standard therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Part 2: Subjects with histologically confirmed, locally advanced or refractory TGCT&#xD;
             (including metastatic disease) that has been deemed unresectable by an orthopedic&#xD;
             surgeon or similar qualified personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 7 days&#xD;
             prior to initiation of dosing and must agree to use an acceptable method of birth&#xD;
             control from the time of the negative pregnancy test up to 3 months after the last&#xD;
             dose of study drug, Fertile men must also agree to use an acceptable method of birth&#xD;
             control while on study drug and up to 3 months after the last dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All associated toxicity from previous or concurrent cancer therapy must be resolved&#xD;
             (to ≤ Grade 1 or Baseline) prior to study treatment administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness and ability to provide written informed consent prior to any study-related&#xD;
             procedures and comply with all study requirements.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy ≥ 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal function.&#xD;

             York Heart Association (NYHA) class 2. Subjects must not have unstable angina (anginal&#xD;

             treatment with antiviral therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness (i.e., active infection ≥ Grade 2) or concurrent&#xD;
             condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would interfere with the study&#xD;
