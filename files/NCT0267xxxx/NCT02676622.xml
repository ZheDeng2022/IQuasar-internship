    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease is an 'auto-immune' disorder of the gut. In this condition the body's own&#xD;
      immune system is fighting its gut and causing inflammation and other symptoms. Patients who&#xD;
      are refractory (not responding) to the medications usually used to control Crohn's disease&#xD;
      (medicines like steroids, azathioprine, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide and antibodies like&#xD;
      Infliximab), may consider being part of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators plan to wipe out (ablate) the 'faulty immune system' with&#xD;
      medicines (immune-ablation) and then give back the patients own stored stem cells (that have&#xD;
      been collected before) - a procedure called autologous (self) stem cell transplant (ASCT).&#xD;
      Once the new immune system regrows again from the stem cells, it is hoped that the 'faulty'&#xD;
      immune cells do not return again and do not fight the gut leading to remission from symptoms&#xD;
      of Crohn's disease. The aim of this treatment therefore, is to reset or re-program the immune&#xD;
      system, so that it does not fight the patient's own body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there are very few trials and experience with this procedure in children and young&#xD;
      adults. There have been a few studies that have shown benefit of ASCT procedure in adult&#xD;
      patients. In some patients, the benefit lasted for 1-5 years; but 1 in 5 (20%) participants&#xD;
      were not taking their medications for the Crohn's disease even 5 years after ASCT. Other 80%&#xD;
      needed medications again, but in most cases with better disease control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to potentially improve the long term outcomes of ASCT, the investigators are adding&#xD;
      another medication (in addition to those used in adult studies) called IL-2 (Aldesleukin),&#xD;
      which will be given as an every-other-day injection under the skin (subcutaneous) at very low&#xD;
      doses for 6 weeks after the ASCT and can be taken at home. Low dose IL-2 is known to increase&#xD;
      a type of immune cell called T-regulatory cells (Tregs) that make immune cells less reactive&#xD;
      to self. Study doctors believe that increased population of Tregs after ASCT may lead to a&#xD;
      better control of Crohn's disease- higher percentage of cures or disease control for a longer&#xD;
      period of time compared to the previous adult trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the goals of this study are-&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To see if ASCT can be used safely and can provide substantial benefit in young adults&#xD;
           who have refractory Crohn's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To see if addition of IL-2 after the ASCT is safe and effective.&#xD;

      Crohn's Disease (CD) is an immunologically mediated chronic illness that has a relapsing and&#xD;
      remitting course, most commonly presenting in the 2nd or 3rd decade and causing life long&#xD;
      impairment of health and quality of life. Mainstay of clinical treatment for severe disease&#xD;
      is combination of anti-inflammatory agents like 5-aminosalicyaltes and immunosuppressive&#xD;
      medications like corticosteroids and newer anti-TNF antibodies like Infliximab. None of the&#xD;
      drugs are, at present, curative and a relevant subset of patients are refractory to many of&#xD;
      these pharmacologic approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunoablative treatment followed by autologous stem cell rescue (Autologous HSCT) has been&#xD;
      tried in this refractory group of patients with successful results. Autologous HSCT works in&#xD;
      this auto-immune setting through the eradication of effector/memory T-cell clones due to a&#xD;
      direct immuno-ablative effect of drugs used in the preparative regimen; by leading to an&#xD;
      immune-reset- recovering clones of T- cells from the infused stem cells do not mount an&#xD;
      auto-immune response and are tolerant to 'self' antigens and, by upregulation of T regulatory&#xD;
      cells (Treg, CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ or CD8+ FOXP3+) via change in cytokine mileu during transplant.&#xD;
      Increased population of Tregs restricts the activity of self reactive effector T-cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study is designed to gain on the success of previously published adult studies of&#xD;
      autologous HSCT in refractory CD, with the aim to confirm the feasibility, safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of HSCT and ultra low dose IL-2 when given post-HSCT in pediatric patients and young&#xD;
      adults. IL-2 in very low doses has been shown to increase the proliferation of Treg&#xD;
      lymphocytes and decrease inflammatory response. Hence, use of IL-2 post-transplant will&#xD;
      result in significant and persistent increase in Treg population that may lead to more&#xD;
      durable remissions after immunoablative therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot will focus on the 'safety' of this treatment in pediatric population.Since, this&#xD;
      combination of immuno-ablative therapy followed by ultra low dose IL-2 has not been studied&#xD;
      in children with CD, therefore transplant related mortality (TRM) and severe toxicity (&gt;&#xD;
      grade 3 toxicity by NCI criteria) will be monitored for 100 days post-transplant in all the&#xD;
      patients and stopping rules will be enforced in case of excessive toxicity or TRM (&gt;10%).&#xD;
      Correlative studies will be performed at specific time points to assess the cytokine and&#xD;
      inflammatory markers, immune-reconstitution and quantitative Treg cells; while clinical&#xD;
      assessments will be done for 1 year post-HSCT for disease activity, steroid free remission&#xD;
      period to evaluate the 'clinical efficacy' of this procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major aim of this pilot is to generate the preliminary safety and cytokine profile data&#xD;
      to confirm the feasibility and benefit of autologous HSCT and IL-2 in children and young&#xD;
      adults with refractory CD.&#xD;
