    <textblock>
      A4091064 is a multicenter, long-term observational study of subjects from tanezumab&#xD;
      interventional studies (regardless of treatment group) who undergo a total knee, hip or&#xD;
      shoulder replacement during participation in the study. The study is designed with a total&#xD;
      duration of subject follow-up of 24 weeks after the total joint replacement surgery. There&#xD;
      will be two methods of data collection utilized in this study: interview by site staff via&#xD;
      the telephone and interactive web-response system (or paper if the subject has no access to&#xD;
      the internet).&#xD;

    <measure>Number of Participants With Surgeon's Assessment of Procedural Difficulty</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Following the TJR surgery on Day 1, the orthopedic surgeon was asked to answer the following question: &quot;taking into consideration the participant's medical history and physical condition prior to surgery would you classify the operative procedure as Uneventful, Minor complications or Major complications.&quot; Participants were reported based on these categories for knee, hip and shoulder joint. Participants may have been counted more than once if they had TJR surgery in more than one joint.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Overall Satisfaction With Surgery as Assessed by the Self-Administered Patient Satisfaction (SAPS) Scale at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>SAPS contained four questions; How satisfied are you with the 1) results of your surgery 2) results of surgery for improving pain 3) results of surgery for improving ability to do home or yard work, and 4) results of surgery for improving your ability to do recreational activities. Items scored on a 4-point Likert scale with response of 'very satisfied' (100 points), 'somewhat satisfied' (75 points), 'somewhat dissatisfied' (50 points), and 'very dissatisfied' (25 points). The scale score calculated as mean of the scores of individual items, ranging from 25 to 100, with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction. Here, number of participants are summarized as, satisfied (very satisfied and somewhat satisfied categories combined) and dissatisfied (somewhat dissatisfied and very dissatisfied categories combined). Participants may have been counted more than once if they had TJR surgery in more than one joint.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Post-surgical complications are adverse events occurring after TJR surgery that were considered clinically significant as assessed by investigator and attributable to the total joint replacement procedure. Participants may have been counted more than once if they had TJR surgery in more than one joint.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Additional or Corrective Procedures Related to Total Joint Replacement Upto Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were asked whether they had been told by their orthopedic surgeon that additional or corrective procedures were necessary for their total joint replacement. Participants, who responded as yes have been reported here. Participants may have been counted more than once if they had TJR surgery in more than one joint.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Who Participated in Physical Rehabilitation Activities Related to Total Joint Replacement Upto Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Participants responded with a yes or no to the following question ''are you participating in physical rehabilitation activities related to your replaced joint''. Participants responded with a yes, have been reported here. Participants may have been counted more than once if they had TJR surgery in more than one joint.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Average Pain Score in to be Replaced or Replaced Joints at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Participants assessed their average pain in to be replaced (pre-surgery) knee/ hip joint or in the replaced joint (post-surgery) in the past 24 hours using an 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS), ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). Higher scores indicated higher pain. Change from baseline was calculated using the difference between post-baseline weekly mean and the baseline mean score. Participants may have been counted more than once if they had TJR surgery in more than one joint.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Pain Subscale at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>WOMAC: Self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire, which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with osteoarthritis (OA). The WOMAC pain subscale is a 5-item questionnaire used to assess the amount of pain experienced due to OA of to be replaced/replaced index joint (knee or hip) during past 48 hours. It was calculated as the mean of scores from 5 individual questions. Scores for each question and WOMAC Pain subscale score on NRS ranged from 0 (no pain) to 10 (extreme pain), where higher scores indicated higher pain. Change from baseline was calculated using the difference between post-baseline weekly mean and the baseline mean score. Participants may have been counted more than once if they had TJR surgery in more than one joint.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Stiffness Subscale at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>WOMAC: self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire, which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with OA. Stiffness was defined as a sensation of decreased ease of movement in the index joint (knee or hip). The WOMAC stiffness subscale is a 2-item questionnaire used to assess the amount of stiffness experienced due to OA in the replaced/to be replaced index joint (knee or hip) during the past 48 hours. It was calculated as the mean of scores from 2 individual questions scored on NRS. Scores for each question and WOMAC stiffness subscale score on NRS ranged from 0 (no stiffness) to 10 (extreme stiffness), where higher scores indicated higher stiffness. Change from baseline was calculated using the difference between post-baseline weekly mean and the baseline mean score. Participants may have been counted more than once if they had TJR surgery in more than one joint.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Physical Function Subscale at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>WOMAC: Self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire, which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with OA. Physical function refers to participant's ability to move around and perform usual activities of daily living. The WOMAC physical function subscale is a 17-item questionnaire used to assess the degree of difficulty experienced due to OA in replaced/ to be replaced index joint (knee or hip) during past 48 hours. It was calculated as mean of the scores from 17 individual questions, which may not be a whole (integer) number, scored on a NRS. Scores for each question and WOMAC physical function subscale score on NRS ranged from 0 (no difficulty) to 10 (extreme difficulty), where higher scores indicated extreme difficulty/worse physical function. Participants may have been counted more than once if they had TJR surgery in more than one joint.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) Score at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>SPADI: self-administered questionnaire to measure pain and disability associated with shoulder pathology in participants with shoulder pain. It consists of two dimensions pain and function. Pain dimension:5 questions regarding severity of pain, scores ranged from 0=no pain to 10=worst pain imaginable, higher scores indicated extreme pain. Functional activities:8 questions to measure degree of difficulty with various activities of daily living that require upper extremity use, scores ranged from 0=no difficulty to 10=so difficult it requires help, higher scores=extreme difficulty. Pain and disability dimension score was calculated as the sum of non-missing scores divided by the maximum possible score (50 [for pain] and 80 [for disability]) multiplied by 100. A total score was calculated as the mean of two dimensions, ranged from 0=best to 100=worst, higher scores indicated worsening of condition.</description>

          <description>Following the TJR surgery on Day 1, the orthopedic surgeon was asked to answer the following question: &quot;taking into consideration the participant's medical history and physical condition prior to surgery would you classify the operative procedure as Uneventful, Minor complications or Major complications.&quot; Participants were reported based on these categories for knee, hip and shoulder joint. Participants may have been counted more than once if they had TJR surgery in more than one joint.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Overall Satisfaction With Surgery as Assessed by the Self-Administered Patient Satisfaction (SAPS) Scale at Week 24</title>
        <description>SAPS contained four questions; How satisfied are you with the 1) results of your surgery 2) results of surgery for improving pain 3) results of surgery for improving ability to do home or yard work, and 4) results of surgery for improving your ability to do recreational activities. Items scored on a 4-point Likert scale with response of 'very satisfied' (100 points), 'somewhat satisfied' (75 points), 'somewhat dissatisfied' (50 points), and 'very dissatisfied' (25 points). The scale score calculated as mean of the scores of individual items, ranging from 25 to 100, with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction. Here, number of participants are summarized as, satisfied (very satisfied and somewhat satisfied categories combined) and dissatisfied (somewhat dissatisfied and very dissatisfied categories combined). Participants may have been counted more than once if they had TJR surgery in more than one joint.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Pain Subscale at Week 24</title>
        <description>WOMAC: Self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire, which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with osteoarthritis (OA). The WOMAC pain subscale is a 5-item questionnaire used to assess the amount of pain experienced due to OA of to be replaced/replaced index joint (knee or hip) during past 48 hours. It was calculated as the mean of scores from 5 individual questions. Scores for each question and WOMAC Pain subscale score on NRS ranged from 0 (no pain) to 10 (extreme pain), where higher scores indicated higher pain. Change from baseline was calculated using the difference between post-baseline weekly mean and the baseline mean score. Participants may have been counted more than once if they had TJR surgery in more than one joint.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Stiffness Subscale at Week 24</title>
        <description>WOMAC: self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire, which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with OA. Stiffness was defined as a sensation of decreased ease of movement in the index joint (knee or hip). The WOMAC stiffness subscale is a 2-item questionnaire used to assess the amount of stiffness experienced due to OA in the replaced/to be replaced index joint (knee or hip) during the past 48 hours. It was calculated as the mean of scores from 2 individual questions scored on NRS. Scores for each question and WOMAC stiffness subscale score on NRS ranged from 0 (no stiffness) to 10 (extreme stiffness), where higher scores indicated higher stiffness. Change from baseline was calculated using the difference between post-baseline weekly mean and the baseline mean score. Participants may have been counted more than once if they had TJR surgery in more than one joint.</description>

        <description>WOMAC: Self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire, which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with OA. Physical function refers to participant's ability to move around and perform usual activities of daily living. The WOMAC physical function subscale is a 17-item questionnaire used to assess the degree of difficulty experienced due to OA in replaced/ to be replaced index joint (knee or hip) during past 48 hours. It was calculated as mean of the scores from 17 individual questions, which may not be a whole (integer) number, scored on a NRS. Scores for each question and WOMAC physical function subscale score on NRS ranged from 0 (no difficulty) to 10 (extreme difficulty), where higher scores indicated extreme difficulty/worse physical function.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) Score at Week 24</title>
        <description>SPADI: self-administered questionnaire to measure pain and disability associated with shoulder pathology in participants with shoulder pain. It consists of two dimensions pain and function. Pain dimension:5 questions regarding severity of pain, scores ranged from 0=no pain to 10=worst pain imaginable, higher scores indicated extreme pain. Functional activities:8 questions to measure degree of difficulty with various activities of daily living that require upper extremity use, scores ranged from 0=no difficulty to 10=so difficult it requires help, higher scores=extreme difficulty. Pain and disability dimension score was calculated as the sum of non-missing scores divided by the maximum possible score (50 [for pain] and 80 [for disability]) multiplied by 100. A total score was calculated as the mean of two dimensions, ranged from 0=best to 100=worst, higher scores indicated worsening of condition.</description>
