    <textblock>
      This study is designed to assess:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The impact of continuous thoracic paravertebral nerve blockade compared to intercostal&#xD;
           nerve blockade on the intensity of postoperative pain following VATS in subjects having&#xD;
           a Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCA) device as their primary analgesic modality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The impact of continuous thoracic paravertebral analgesia on length of stay, opioid&#xD;
           intake, respiratory function, incidence of side-effects and postoperative complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The basic hypothesis of this study is that continuous thoracic paravertebral nerve blockade&#xD;
      will provide superior postoperative analgesia following VATS when compared to intercostal&#xD;
      nerve blockade in patients having a PCA device as their primary analgesic modality. Superior&#xD;
      quality of analgesia should contribute to preserve pulmonary function, reduce opioid intake&#xD;
      and related side-effects and shorten the hospital stay.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Appropriate postoperative analgesia is crucial in fast-track surgery, which is a multimodal&#xD;
      therapeutic strategy that aims toward enhanced postoperative recovery and shortened hospital&#xD;
      stay. Although VATS is considered a minimally invasive procedure, patients have reported&#xD;
      moderate to severe pain of variable duration following surgery. The ideal postoperative&#xD;
      analgesia regimen for VATS has not been elucidated. Systemic opioids given through&#xD;
      patient-controlled devices (PCA) are routinely used after these procedures but their&#xD;
      analgesic effect can be limited and undesirable side-effects may occur. Intercostal nerve&#xD;
      blockade is also widely used to alleviate pain following VATS and can be used as an adjunct&#xD;
      to systemic opioids. Paravertebral nerve blockade is an interesting alternative for analgesia&#xD;
      following VATS. The duration of pain relief associated with paravertebral nerve blockade may&#xD;
      vary from 4 to 48 hours. However, the duration of the analgesic effect can be prolonged using&#xD;
      a continuous infusion of local anesthetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will compare the efficacy of continuous ambulatory paravertebral analgesia to&#xD;
      intercostal analgesia. All patients will have a PCA device as their primary analgesic&#xD;
      modality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seventy patients will be randomized to receive either continuous paravertebral analgesia or&#xD;
      intercostal analgesia. Anesthetic technique and monitoring will be standardized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On arrival in the recovery room, each patient will have a PCA device installed. PCA doses&#xD;
      will be standardized. All patients will also receive acetaminophen and non-steroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) as co-analgesia. PCA will be removed 24 hours after surgery&#xD;
      and oral opioids will then be administered as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From their arrival in the recovery room, patients in the paravertebral analgesia group will&#xD;
      be administered a bupivacaine 0.0625% infusion through a conventional infusion pump at a rate&#xD;
      of 10 mL/h. Before discharge from the hospital on the day following surgery or at the latest&#xD;
      on the morning of the second day, the bupivacaine infusion will be transferred to a portable&#xD;
      elastomeric pump. The infusion will continue for the next 30 hours at a rate of 10 mL/h.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first 72 hours following surgery, the following information will be recorded:&#xD;
      intensity of pain, opioid intake, side-effects attributable to analgesia and patient's level&#xD;
      of satisfaction towards pain management. The occurence of pulmonary complications will be&#xD;
      noted. Lung function will be measured using a peak flow meter. Length of stay in the recovery&#xD;
      room, in the intermediate intensive care unit and in the hospital will be recorded. Time to&#xD;
      reach post-anesthesia discharge criteria will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be contacted by telephone 2 times a day if hospital discharge occurs before 72&#xD;
      hours after surgery to assess their level of pain and analgesic intake, the presence of&#xD;
      side-effects or complications and their satisfaction level towards pain management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will also include a sub-study to be performed on ten human cadavers. The goal of&#xD;
      the sub-study will be to assess the impact of the orientation of the bevel of the&#xD;
      paravertebral block needle on the ease of insertion and positioning of the paravertebral&#xD;
      catheter using ultrasound imaging.&#xD;
