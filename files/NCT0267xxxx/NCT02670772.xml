      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate whether low dose stavudine (d4T) is non-inferior&#xD;
      (in terms of both viral suppression and toxicity) to tenofovir (TDF) after 2 years of HIV&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group, multisite, study to&#xD;
      demonstrate whether low dose stavudine (d4T) is non-inferior to tenofovir (in terms of both&#xD;
      viral suppression and toxicity) to tenofovir (TDF) after 2 years of HIV treatment. If so,&#xD;
      this will allow approximately two people requiring antiretrovirals to be treated for the&#xD;
      price of one, with the same outcomes at two years. This is of huge public health consequence&#xD;
      in Southern Africa, where TDF and zidovudine (AZT) now consume the majority of the&#xD;
      antiretroviral budget. Decreasing total drug doses of antiretroviral agents, while&#xD;
      maintaining efficacy, represents an untapped possibility for decreasing costs and toxicity,&#xD;
      if efficacy can be maintained. Stavudine (d4T), an NRTI, is currently the second most&#xD;
      commonly used antiretroviral worldwide in developing countries. Stavudine is an ideal&#xD;
      candidate for assessment because of low cost, widespread use, and co-formulation, albeit at a&#xD;
      dose that has significant side effects. While well tolerated in the short term,&#xD;
      dose-dependent medium and long-term side effects, namely lipoatrophy and peripheral&#xD;
      neuropathy, are very common. lipoatrophy is insidious, largely irreversible, and highly&#xD;
      stigmatising, These toxicities have lead to the withdrawal of Stavudine as a recommended drug&#xD;
      in most countries that can afford an alternative, even in second and subsequent regimens; the&#xD;
      World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends that countries, wherever possible, move away from&#xD;
      using Stavudine. However, there are data that suggest a lower dose of Stavudine would be&#xD;
      better tolerated than the currently recommended dose and will be as effective in suppressing&#xD;
      viral load as currently preferred first-line drugs. Consented patients will be randomised&#xD;
      into one of two treatment arms using the interactive voice response systems (IVRS). The study&#xD;
      monitor will maintain current personal knowledge of the study through observation, review of&#xD;
      study records and source documentation, and discussion of the conduct of the study with the&#xD;
      principal investigator or sub investigator and staff. Data will be captured onto electronic&#xD;
      data capture system and managed for completeness, consistency and accuracy. All study&#xD;
      operations such as patient recruitment, data management, safety reporting will be guided by&#xD;
      Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) documents. A total of 1068 male and female&#xD;
      antiretroviral-naive patients infected with HIV-1 will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio&#xD;
      (approximately 534 patients per treatment group) to Treatment Group 1 (d4T/3TC+EFV) or&#xD;
      Treatment Group 2 (TDF/3TC+EFV). Approximately 15% of patients are expected not to be&#xD;
      evaluable for the PP set, therefore resulting in 907 patients for the PP set. This will&#xD;
      provide 90% power to show non-inferiority between the 2 treatment groups for the proportion&#xD;
      of patients achieving the primary efficacy endpoint (undetectable plasma HIV-1 RNA levels&#xD;
      [&lt;50 copies/mL] at Week 48) for the PP set (and 94% power for the all-randomised set), using&#xD;
      a non-inferiority margin of 10% and a 1-sided 2.5 significance level. The proportion of&#xD;
      patients achieving the primary efficacy endpoint has been assumed to be 70% in both treatment&#xD;
      groups. The sample size calculation has been adjusted to allow for stopping at 2 interim&#xD;
      analyses.&#xD;
