  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to compare early surgical complications after abdominoplasty&#xD;
      performed by plastic and general surgeons. Secondary aims were to assess whether specific&#xD;
      guidelines might have impact on the rate of complications. The hypothesis is that general&#xD;
      surgeons have more complications.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Bariatric surgery has gained widespread acceptance and 6,800 patients are yearly operated in&#xD;
      Sweden. Approximately 30 % of these patients require abdominoplasties for functional&#xD;
      disabilities being a total of 2,300 patients. Today the plastic surgeons of the departments&#xD;
      of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery do not have the capacity to accommodate this demand. A&#xD;
      Department of General Surgery started to perform abdominoplasties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a retrospective cohort study. Charts were retrieved from 69 consecutive patients&#xD;
      operated by general surgeons at Capio S:t Görans Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden (group A) from&#xD;
      13th of May to 19th of December 2011. Charts from 70 consecutive patients operated by plastic&#xD;
      surgeons at the Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Karolinska University&#xD;
      Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden (group B) were studied from 14th of January 2010 to 7th of&#xD;
      December 2012. Collected data consist of patient demographics, operation methods, and&#xD;
      complications observed at 30 days' follow-up. The outcome of a third group of about 70&#xD;
      patients operated between 22th of January 2013 to 3th of June 2014 at S:t Görans Hospital&#xD;
      (group C) are compared to the outcome of groups B and A. Guidelines for the surgical&#xD;
      technique as well as pre-and postoperative care were refined between the operations of group&#xD;
      A and C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics Anova and regression analysis will be applied. And for dichotomous data Chi-Square&#xD;
      test and Fischers exact test will be calculated. Power was calculated with the test of&#xD;
      proportion for two independent groups and 5 per cent significance.&#xD;

    <description>Between two of the cohorts new guidelines was introduced, and the same dichotomous data (yes/no) was collected and with logistic regression analyzed to assess if the applied guidelines made any effect on the complications. The guidelines, if followed, was yes/no.</description>
