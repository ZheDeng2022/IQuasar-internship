      To create a data base that will facilitate the enrichment of the insights regarding&#xD;
      post-operative pain development, and to identify those individuals with the potential to&#xD;
      develop this kind of pain. The identification will be based on the individualized pain&#xD;
      modulation profile, composed of a battery of tests as detailed below.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pro-nociceptive pain modulation profile (PMP) is characterized by either:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) decreased inhibition of pain, i.e.inhibitory pro-nociceptive PMP, (ii) increased&#xD;
      facilitation, i.e. facilitatory pro-nociceptive PMP, or (iii) both, i.e. dual pro-nociceptive&#xD;
      PMP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The counterpart of pro-nociceptive, i.e., anti-nociceptive PMP, has not yet been explored.&#xD;
      The investigators expect individuals harboring this profile to be at lower risk for pain&#xD;
      acquisition, and experience less intense pain. Pain modulation is commonly altered in pain&#xD;
      patients toward a pro-nociceptive pain modulation profile (PMP), expressed, in the lab, by&#xD;
      increased facilitation and/or decreased inhibition of experimental pain, and clinically by&#xD;
      high pain phenotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study seeks to explore the yet to be characterized mirror image of&#xD;
      pro-nociception, i.e., the situation where individuals exhibit reduced pain facilitation and&#xD;
      more efficient pain inhibition. This domain of 'anti-nociceptive' PMP is a potential platform&#xD;
      for improving pain therapy and prevention. Extrapolating from the clinical picture of&#xD;
      pro-nociception, it is likely that 'antinociceptive' individuals will express a lower pain&#xD;
      phenotype, with less frequent and less intense pain experiences, lower risk of acquiring pain&#xD;
      after surgery or trauma, and, possibly, better response to analgesics. The investigators&#xD;
      would like to explore whether it is possible to shift pain modulation towards&#xD;
      anti-nociception, in order to obtain the possible benefits of this modulation profile in&#xD;
      pain-prone situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical model the investigators propose for addressing the hypotheses is preemptive drug&#xD;
      treatment for reduction of postoperative pain. Our specific choice of surgery is inguinal&#xD;
      herniorraphy. In addition to acute post-operative pain, this operation carries a relatively&#xD;
      high rate of chronic post-operative pain (ranging from 10 to 54% of patients, with most&#xD;
      reports indicating towards the lower end of this range).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our specific aims are to explore, in the setup of post operative pain after inguinal&#xD;
      herniorraphy, the shift of PMP from pro- towards anti-nociceptive based on each of the&#xD;
      following testing domains:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) Psychophysical and neurophysiological data describing facilitatory and inhibitory&#xD;
      modulation capacity of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (ii) Psychological data describing patient's behavior such as catastrophizing, anxiety and&#xD;
      depression, pain sensitivity and life orientation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (iii) Blood tests to evaluate Micro RNA which regulate downstream transcription or shutting&#xD;
      down gene expression, in order to evaluate their role as predictor for evolving chronic pain,&#xD;
      and (v) individual case data related to age, gender, education, socioeconomic parameters and&#xD;
      personal medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study A: One hundred and forty healthy subjects (range 20-79; 20 subjects per age&#xD;
           decade, 10 M, and 10 F) will participate in the first phase of the study aimed to&#xD;
           collect normative data from healthy population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study B: Two hundred and twenty patients (range 18-75) scheduled for inguinal&#xD;
           herniorraphy will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design Study I - Normative data collection for the inhibitory and excitatory pain&#xD;
      modulation responses, a study on healthy subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include one session. In this session, after signing informed consent, subjects&#xD;
      will:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) fill out state of health questionnaire, (ii) record 5 minutes of resting state EEG, and&#xD;
      (iii) undergo a short familiarization with the various stimulation modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thereafter, and along the session subjects will fill the pain related personality&#xD;
      questionnaires (anxiety and depression, catastrophizing, pain sensitivity, life orientation&#xD;
      test and ten item personality measure) followed by psychophysical assessments, which will&#xD;
      include assessment of conditioned pain modulation (CPM) and temporal pain summation (TS) as&#xD;
      described later on. A sample of 20 ml of blood will be drawn from all subjects at the end of&#xD;
      the session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study II - Herniorraphy surgery patients This study is a randomized, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      double-blind, three parallel arms non-crossover longitudinal study in four groups of patients&#xD;
      identified by their PMPs. The study will consist of two assessment sessions: the first&#xD;
      between 1 to 2 weeks before surgery and the second 3 month after surgery. The sessions will&#xD;
      be conducted by experienced experimenter, and will include the same psychophysical and&#xD;
      psychological assessments as in Study I; after signing informed consent, patients will&#xD;
      undergo a short familiarization with the various stimulation modalities and then undergo the&#xD;
      various stimuli.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of this session patients will be assigned into one of four groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) dual pro-nociceptive, (ii) inhibitory pro-nociceptive, (iii) facilitatory&#xD;
      pro-nociceptive, and (iv) anti-nociceptive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      45 patients will be assigned into each group, by order of their recruitment. Third of the&#xD;
      patients in each group will be randomized to Duloxetine (DUL), third to Pregabalin (PGB) and&#xD;
      the other third to Placebo (PLA). Each group will receive two treatment doses of the drug&#xD;
      before surgery, i.e. one in the evening before and one at the morning of the surgery.&#xD;
      Patients will then undergo surgery, to be performed by one team of surgeons, under a&#xD;
      standardized protocol of general anesthesia. After surgery patients will be treated by a&#xD;
      standardized analgesic protocol until discharge, normally the morning after surgery. Acute&#xD;
      pain intensity and analgesics consumption during the first 24 hours will be recorded. On&#xD;
      post-operative day (POD) 1 patients will fill a &quot;patient outcome questionnaire&quot; that will&#xD;
      include information about their perceived post-operative pain intensity and the extent of&#xD;
      pain interference with activities and effects on mood and anxiety. A periodic phone call for&#xD;
      chronic postoperative pain will be pursued at 1, 2, 4 weeks and 6 months after surgery. An&#xD;
      experimenter blinded to the psycho-physical group assignment, will follow the pain state&#xD;
      after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two samples of 20 ml of blood will be drawn from all patients; first blood withdrawal will be&#xD;
      done before surgery, and the second at a clinic visit between 3 and 6 month after surgery.&#xD;
