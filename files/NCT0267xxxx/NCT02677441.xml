    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the non-inferiority of conservative management for acromioclavicular&#xD;
      clavicle disjunction, compared with surgical management. Half of patients will be treated&#xD;
      with a specific standardized rehabilitation protocol, and the other half will be treated with&#xD;
      coracoclavicular and acromioclavicular fixation, followed by a another specific standardized&#xD;
      rehabilitation protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is the non-inferiority of the conservative management over surgical&#xD;
      management of Rockwood III-V Acute acromioclavicular joint dislocation (ACJD) without PICCAT&#xD;
      with American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES score) at one year. If the non-inferiority is&#xD;
      reached, the non-inferiority of the conservative management over surgical the management of&#xD;
      Rockwood III-V ACJD with PICCAT using ASES score at one year will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes were radiological criteria (i.e. comparison of ipsilateral and&#xD;
      contralateral coracoclavicular distance on anterior view; and dynamic posterior shaft of the&#xD;
      cross-body adduction Basamania/Alexander view) return to sports, work absenteeism,&#xD;
      complication rate, cosmetic results, patients satisfaction, Constant score, Single Assesment&#xD;
      Numeric Evaluation (SANE) score, Acromioclavicular Joint Instability (ACJI) score, ASES score&#xD;
      at others timepoints, and range of motion of the implicated shoulder. Finally, multivariable&#xD;
      regression analysis will be performed in order to evaluate the impact of predictors of&#xD;
      interest on ASES score at one year.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background and rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACJD can be either managed conservatively or surgically. Concerning functional outcomes, it&#xD;
      usually accepted that ACJD Rockwood state I and II should be treated conservatively.It is&#xD;
      still debated whether grade III should be treated surgically or not, and only experts opinion&#xD;
      suggest that grade IV and V has better surgical outcome than conservative. The main&#xD;
      literature failed to demonstrate the superiority of the surgical management for functional&#xD;
      outcomes. Despite this, operative management results in a better cosmetic outcome, but&#xD;
      conservative management is associated with a lower duration of sick leave and lesser costs.&#xD;
      It has been purposed by a worldwide expert consensus (ISAKOS consensus) that dynamic&#xD;
      posterior clavicle impaction into the trapezius muscle (PICCAT) could be a predictive factor&#xD;
      of poor functional outcome in case of conservative management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H0: ASES score at one year of follow-up is better with surgical management than with&#xD;
      conservative management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: one year ASES score after conservative management is not inferior as after surgical&#xD;
      management. H1 will be first tested without PICCAT. If H1 is validated, it will then be&#xD;
      tested again including all patients, PICCAT or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multicentric case-control study is randomized 1:1 between conservative and surgical&#xD;
      treatment of ACJD. It is a non-inferiority trial that includes 176 patients that suffers from&#xD;
      acute ACJD Rockwood grade III-V. Conservative management will consist of a sling for 10 days&#xD;
      followed by a standardized physical therapy program, (Cote et al. 2010) and surgical&#xD;
      management will consist of coracoclavicular and acromioclavicular fixation and specific&#xD;
      rehabilitation. Clinical follow-up will last one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-inferiority statistical analysis will be performed upon appropriate unilateral 95%&#xD;
      confidence interval margin (Z = -1.645), with a non-inferiority margin of 6.4, corresponding&#xD;
      to ASES minimal clinically important difference. Analysis is planned in case of &quot;intention to&#xD;
      treat&quot; method, but, if patients of the conservative management group undergo surgery because&#xD;
      they are unsatisfied, ASES score will be measured prior surgery instead of at one year of&#xD;
      follow-up. No statistical adjustments on potential confounders are planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ASES score minimal clinically important difference has been estimated to 6.4. ASES standard&#xD;
      deviation after surgical management of ACJD has been estimated to 9.7. If there is truly no&#xD;
      difference between the surgical and conservative treatments, then 80 patients are required to&#xD;
      be 90% sure that the lower limit of a one-sided 95% confidence interval (or equivalently a&#xD;
      90% two-sided confidence interval) will be above the non-inferiority limit of -6.4. Mazzoca,&#xD;
      one of the main authors of ISAKOS consensus (ISAKOS), has reported operating 50% of Rockwood&#xD;
      type III-V ACJD. From this, we can strongly suppose that 50% of Rockwood type III-V ACJD&#xD;
      presents PICCAT. Considering a 10% of drop-outs, we therefore need 80/(50%)*110% = 176&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
