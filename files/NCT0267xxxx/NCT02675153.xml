  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease （CD） with stenosis has limited therapeutic options and with high surgical&#xD;
      rate. The present clinical trial aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rapamycin in the&#xD;
      treatment of stricturing Crohn's Disease.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Management of Crohn's disease （CD） with stenosis is challenging and often requires endoscopic&#xD;
      dilatation or surgical resection of the strictured bowel. Sirolimus (rapamycin), a&#xD;
      macrocyclic antibiotic with immunosuppressive and antineoplastic properties, has been&#xD;
      reported as promising rescue therapy for refractory CD. This study aims to evaluate the use&#xD;
      of sirolimus for stricturing Crohn's Disease. Patients in this study will receive a&#xD;
      continuous dosing schedule of oral sirolimus 2mg daily for six months. Clinical responses&#xD;
      were defined as the ability to tolerate the regular diet with vegetable fiber combined with a&#xD;
      reduction of ≥ 75% in overall target score and a score of less than two points for each item.&#xD;
