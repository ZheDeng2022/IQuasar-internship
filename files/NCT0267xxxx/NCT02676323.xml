  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer is the uncontrolled growth of human cells. The growth of normal human cells is&#xD;
      controlled by multiple mechanisms. Panobinostat belongs to a class of chemotherapy drugs&#xD;
      called &quot;histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors.&quot; HDAC inhibitors like panobinostat block&#xD;
      enzymes known as histone deacetylases, which stops cancer cells from dividing and causes them&#xD;
      to die. Fludarabine and cytarabine are chemotherapy drugs that are commonly used to treat&#xD;
      pediatric patients with refractory or relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or&#xD;
      myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of panobinostat and to find the highest dose&#xD;
      of panobinostat that can be given safely when it is combined with fludarabine and cytarabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study will be done in two parts: The goal of Part 1 of the study is to find the&#xD;
      highest tolerable dose of panobinostat that can be given to patients with AML or MDS, when it&#xD;
      is combined with fludarabine and cytarabine. Once that dose is determined, participants will&#xD;
      be enrolled on Part 2: Dose Expansion, to look at the effect of the&#xD;
      panobinostat/fludarabine/cytarabine combination in patients with leukemia/MDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine a tolerable dose of panobinostat when given in combination with fludarabine&#xD;
           and cytarabine in pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory AML or MDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Characterize the pharmacokinetics of panobinostat after the first dose and at&#xD;
           steady-state.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimate the overall response rate to the combination of panobinostat, fludarabine, and&#xD;
           cytarabine.&#xD;

      STUDY PART 1: Dose Escalation Cohort&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the dose escalation phase (Part 1), participants will receive one course of&#xD;
      panobinostat plus fludarabine and cytarabine. The starting dose of panobinostat will be 10&#xD;
      mg/m^2/dose, with 2 additional dose levels of 15 and 20, depending on tolerability. Each&#xD;
      course is 12 days&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PART 2: Dose Expansion Cohort&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) will be chosen based on the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)&#xD;
      and the totality of data obtained from study Part 1. Additional patients will be enrolled, if&#xD;
      needed, so that at least 6 patients are treated with the recommended RP2D to confirm the MTD&#xD;
      of panobinostat to be given in study Part 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After final MTD determination, 12 additional participants will be treated at this dose level&#xD;
      for further evaluation of tolerability and response, including more complete toxicity data&#xD;
      and estimation of the response rate to the combination of panobinostat, fludarabine, and&#xD;
      cytarabine.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Up to 56 days following first dose of panobinostat</time_frame>
    <description>Any participant who experiences non-hematologic dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during the first 28 days after taking the initial dose of panobinostat and before receiving non-protocol therapy is considered evaluable for toxicity. Non-hematologic DLT includes any Grade 5 event and any Grade 3 or 4 event that is at least possibly related to panobinostat, unless the event is clearly due to extraneous causes or disease progression. Hematologic DLT includes failure to recover counts by Day 56 in the absence of persistent leukemia.&#xD;
Participants without DLTs who receive at least 5 of the 6 prescribed cycle I doses of panobinostat and can be followed for 28 days (56 days for evaluation of hematologic toxicity) after their initial dose of panobinostat are considered evaluable for toxicity. Participants who are not evaluable for toxicity will be replaced.&#xD;
The MTD is defined as the highest dose level at which six participants have been treated with at most one participant experiencing a DLT.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Participants must have a diagnosis of AML or MDS and must have disease that has&#xD;
             relapsed or is refractory to chemotherapy, or that has relapsed after hematopoietic&#xD;
             stem cell transplantation (HSCT).&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients must have fully recovered from the acute effects of all prior therapy and&#xD;
             must meet the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  At least 14 days must have elapsed since the completion of myelosuppressive&#xD;
                  therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  At least 24 hours must have elapsed since the completion of low-dose&#xD;
                  chemotherapy, such as hydroxyurea or low-dose cytarabine (up to 200 mg/m^2/day).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For patients who have received prior HSCT, there can be no evidence of GVHD and&#xD;

                  All such medications must be discontinued at least 24 hours prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body Surface Area: Because the smallest capsule size available for the panobinostat is&#xD;
             10 mg, the minimum BSA allowed for enrollment at Dose Level 1 to 0.85 m^2. The minimum&#xD;
             for Dose Level 2 is BSA=0.6 m^2 and the minimum for Dose Level 3 is BSA=0.42 m^2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

          -  Must not be pregnant or breastfeeding. Female patients who are sexually active and of&#xD;
             child-bearing potential must agree to use dual methods of contraception and have a&#xD;
             negative serum pregnancy test at screening, and male patients who are sexually active&#xD;
             must use an effective barrier method of contraception if sexually active with a female&#xD;
             of child-bearing potential. For both male and female patients who are sexually active,&#xD;
             effective methods of contraception must be used throughout the study and for three&#xD;
             months following the last dose. Abstinence is an acceptable form of contraception.&#xD;

             interpretation of study research.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled infection within one week of the first dose. Infections controlled on&#xD;
             concurrent anti-microbial agents are acceptable, and anti-microbial prophylaxis per&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Known human immunodeficiency virus infection (pre-study testing not required).&#xD;

             history or presence of sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Impairment of GI function or GI disease that may significantly alter the absorption of&#xD;
             panobinostat.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients using medications that have a relative risk of prolonging the QT interval or&#xD;
             inducing torsade de pointes if treatment cannot be discontinued or switched to a&#xD;
