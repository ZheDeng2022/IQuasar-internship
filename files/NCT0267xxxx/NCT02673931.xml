      Patients undergoing open heart surgery are at risk of suffering damage to the heart, brain&#xD;
      and kidneys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed as a 2-by-2 randomized clinical trial with the purpose of&#xD;
      investigating the organ protective effects of the glucagon-like-peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonist&#xD;
      Exenatide versus placebo and restrictive versus liberal oxygenation during weaning from&#xD;
      cardio-pulmonary bypass.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) have associated atherosclerotic renal and&#xD;
      cerebral disease making these organs especially vulnerable to ischemia during open heart&#xD;
      surgery. At the Heart Center at Rigshospitalet in Copenhagen the investigators perform more&#xD;
      than 1000 open heart surgery operations yearly. The primary indication is CAD with or without&#xD;
      associated valvular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical treatment of patients with CAD is performed as coronary artery bypass grafting&#xD;
      (CABG) or off- pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCAB). CABG requires the use of&#xD;
      extracorporeal circulation, while this is not the case for OPCAB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During extracorporeal circulation the heart is arrested and anticoagulated. Blood is exposed&#xD;
      to artificial surfaces and mechanical stress potentially resulting in increased risk of a&#xD;
      systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), arterial emboli and organ hypoperfusion with&#xD;
      the potential for multi organ failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 30-day mortality following elective CABG is 1-2%, increasing to 7% if associated with&#xD;
      valve surgery. The elderly patients with reduced renal function and more concomitant disease&#xD;
      have a 30-day mortality as high as 20%. Patients dying following open heart surgery often&#xD;
      have severe heart failure including cardiogenic shock, occlusion of grafts or native coronary&#xD;
      arteries, renal failure, stroke/transient ischemic attack and severe inflammation prior to&#xD;
      death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of renal failure requiring dialysis is dependent on renal function prior to&#xD;
      surgery. With more elderly patients having surgery this incidence is increasing. Renal&#xD;
      failure is often seen in conjunction with progression of heart failure or development of new&#xD;
      onset heart failure. Factors associated with brain involvement in cardiac surgery are macro&#xD;
      embolism, systemic hypotension, systemic venous hypertension and maldistribution of cerebral&#xD;
      blood flow. The incidence of postoperative cognitive deficits are above 50% depending on when&#xD;
      this is measured. After 12 months the figure is approximately 30%. Known factors associated&#xD;
      with cognitive deficits are age and duration of bypass, however type of surgery (valve&#xD;
      insertion), temperature, equipment (oxygenators, filters) and techniques of de-airing may be&#xD;
      important. For the neuropsychological deficits micro embolism, altered brain flow and a&#xD;
      systemic inflammatory response are probably involved. The incidence of these complications&#xD;
      during OPCAB is unknown, but expected to be slightly lower.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many pharmacological interventions have been tested in order to protect the brain during&#xD;
      surgery with varying degree of success (Ketamine vs. Remifentanil, Glucose, insulin,&#xD;
      potassium solution; Platelet activate factor antagonist; Piracetam; Lidocaine; Ramacemide;&#xD;
      Clomethiozole. None of these has made it into clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glucagon-like-peptide-1 agonist - Background Exenatide has been proven effective in reducing&#xD;
      infarct size in a model of acute myocardial infarcts and reperfusion in swine. Several animal&#xD;
      studies and some clinical studies have been published demonstrating a beneficial effect of&#xD;
      glucagon-like-peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogs in the treatment of various degenerative neurological&#xD;
      diseases. The fact that type-2 diabetes has been shown to be associated with the development&#xD;
      of the development of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease has lead to the hypothesis&#xD;
      that insulin signaling impairment could be involved in the disease process. By the&#xD;
      introduction of incretins such as GLP-1 analogs as treatments options in type-2 diabetes,&#xD;
      increased awareness of potential role in the amelioration of symptoms associated with&#xD;
      neurodegenerative diseases have emerged. In fact GLP-1 analogs have beneficial effects on&#xD;
      memory formation and on synaptic plasticity in the brain in animal models, and prevent&#xD;
      detrimental effects of Î²-amyloid in a rat model. Clinical studies have yet to prove these&#xD;
      associations in humans. In addition it is well known that GLP-1 and analogs crosses the&#xD;
      blood-brain barrier. Regarding ischemic injury in stroke models GLP-1 analogs have also drawn&#xD;
      some attention. Exenatide (also known as exentide-4) infused after focal brain ischemia has&#xD;
      been shown to reduce infarct volume in mice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In clinical testing in humans a recent randomized clinical study investigated the effect of&#xD;
      Exendin-4 (Exenatide) on final infarct size in myocardial infarction. Patients receiving&#xD;
      Exenatide tended to have a lower final infarct size and a larger salvage index evaluated by&#xD;
      cardiac magnetic resonance 3 months following index event. These findings have been confirmed&#xD;
      in later trials. Importantly the investigational drug was administered in acutely ill&#xD;
      patients, receiving acute revascularization for acute myocardial infarction, with no&#xD;
      increased risk of adverse events, and no excess adverse events including hypoglycemia or&#xD;
      pancreatitis were reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Restrictive vs. liberal oxygen administration during weaning from circulatory by-pass -&#xD;
      Background Weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass is a process completing the cardiac surgery&#xD;
      procedure, during which, the heart has been stopped, and the function of the heart and lungs&#xD;
      has been substituted by an extracorporeal blood pump and oxygenator. After completion of the&#xD;
      surgical procedure the heart is allowed to start beating, and will gradually take over the&#xD;
      function of the extracorporeal by-pass. Also the patient ventilated. During this process is&#xD;
      standard procedure to administer 100% FiO2 during the weaning process to ensure sufficient&#xD;
      oxygen supply to the heart and other organs. The FiO2 is often reduced according to the&#xD;
      patients needs during transfer to the intensive care unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study hypothesize that a FiO2 of 50% is superior to the standard FiO2 of 100% in&#xD;
      reducing the incidence of the primary and secondary endpoints as described below, based on&#xD;
      the following background data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preclinical data suggest that hyperoxia increase cerebral damage and neurological dysfunction&#xD;
      following brain ischemia. Most data originates from cardiac arrest models in which a no-flow&#xD;
      state is induced and cerebral injury or neurological dysfunction is assessed. Fairly small&#xD;
      randomized controlled trials (RCT's) in humans have found increased levels of neuron-specific&#xD;
      enolase (NSE) but not S-100B in patients randomized to FiO2=100% compared to FiO2=30%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyperoxia during and after ischemia has been investigated in several settings, and a final&#xD;
      consensus of its benefits and hazards has yet to be established. In the following the term&#xD;
      hyperoxia is used in situations where the FiO2 is increased to levels above 50% for&#xD;
      simplicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyperoxia may increase the risk of developing lung injury (hyperoxia-induced lung injury -&#xD;
      HALI), which carries a high morbidity and mortality. However, this condition seems to require&#xD;
      several days of extremely high FiO2 to be significant and various ventilation modes may have&#xD;
      a significant impact as well. The risk of HALI associated with shorter periods of hyperoxia&#xD;
      seems small.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ischemia reperfusion injury has been investigated in smaller studies only in relation to&#xD;
      circulatory bypass with no significant impact on magnitude of increase in biomarkers related&#xD;
      to cardiac injury according to a review by. Oxygen administration during transport for&#xD;
      primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with ST segment myocardial&#xD;
      infarction has recently been associated with increased release of creatinine kinasis and&#xD;
      larger final infarcts size on cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). The impact of shorter&#xD;
      courses of oxygen supplement during weaning from circulatory bypass has yet to be&#xD;
      investigated. A direct influence of hyperoxia with an increase in systemic vascular&#xD;
      resistance has also been suggested, and hyperoxia may not be associated with improved tissue&#xD;
      oxygenation, while the clinical effects of this finding remain to be understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent systematic review and metaanalysis suggested that the risk of surgical site&#xD;
      infections may be reduced with hyperoxia. However, a larger RCT in abdominal surgery found an&#xD;
      increased mortality with hyperoxia, in particular in patients undergoing surgery for&#xD;
      malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, hyperoxia may reduce risks associated with surgery with regards to surgical site&#xD;
      infections and possibly reperfusion injury, whereas the effects on overall benefit in term of&#xD;
      mortality may be detrimental. Further research is needed, and for the time being an equipoise&#xD;
      with regards to the benefits of hyperoxia when weaning patients from circulatory bypass&#xD;
      exits. Most patients will require some degree of oxygen supplement when lungs are ventilated&#xD;
      after apnea during circulatory bypass, hence this study pragmatically studies a restrictive&#xD;
      (FiO2=50%) vs. a liberal oxygenation strategy (FiO2=100%)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following open heart surgery damage to brain, kidneys and the myocardium is frequently seen&#xD;
      due to organ ischemia. Animal experiments as well as small human studies suggest that a GLP-1&#xD;
      agonist may be able to reduce ischemic damage. Currently, there is no protective treatment&#xD;
      available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A GLP-1 agonist has the potential to protect the brain, the kidneys and the heart during open&#xD;
      heart surgery. The treatment can easily be administered for a short time to a large&#xD;
      population at risk. Thus, a large scale randomized study testing the efficacy of a GLP-1&#xD;
      agonist against placebo can conclusively determine if patients will benefit from this&#xD;
      treatment given pre-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Restrictive vs. liberal oxygenation during weaning from circulatory bypass has not been&#xD;
      tested in clinical trails and as seen above an equipoise for assessing the net clinical&#xD;
      benefit of these strategies exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A GLP-1 agonist started pre-operatively to patients undergoing coronary artery bypass&#xD;
           grafting will reduce mortality and morbidity due to damage to the heart, brain and&#xD;
           kidneys.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Restrictive oxygenation (FiO2=50%) during weaning from circulatory bypass during the&#xD;
           surgical procedure will reduce mortality and morbidity due to damage to the heart, brain&#xD;
           and kidneys as well as reduce significant surgical site infection (requiring surgical&#xD;
           debridement and/or prolonging hospitalization) compared to liberal oxygenation&#xD;
           (FiO2=100%).&#xD;
