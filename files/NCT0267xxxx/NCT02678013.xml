  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common and the third leading cause of&#xD;
      cancer-related death worldwide. Recurrence of tumor within the liver remnant is common, with&#xD;
      a reported 5-year recurrence rate of 70%. Repeat hepatectomy is an effective treatment for&#xD;
      intrahepatic HCC but with a small proportion of resection rate because of the poor functional&#xD;
      liver reserve and postoperative complications. Radiofrequency ablation(RFA) is becoming the&#xD;
      main effective treatment for small HCC (≤5.0cm). The efficacy of RFA for recurrent HCC has&#xD;
      been reported to be comparable to those achieved by surgery with minimal, but higher local&#xD;
      recurrence rate after RFA. It has been reported that immunotherapy in patients who underwent&#xD;
      curative treatment for HCC, adjuvant immunotherapy with activated CIK cells increased&#xD;
      recurrence-free and overall survival. But there is little evidence for adjuvant immunotherapy&#xD;
      of recurrence HCC. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes(CTL), a kind of effective T cells that specific&#xD;
      recognizing and killing antigen targeted cells through cloning amplification after receiving&#xD;
      antigen information from antigen presented cell and playing key role to clear cancerous&#xD;
      cells. So our hypothesis is that RFA combined with immunotherapy (Highly-purified CTL) is&#xD;
      superior to RFA for recurrent HCC. The aim of this prospective study is to compare the&#xD;
      outcome of RFA combined with immunotherapy (Highly-purified CTL) with RFA for small recurrent&#xD;
      HCC after partial hepatectomy.&#xD;

    <description>RFA was performed according to the Guidelines of Radiofrequency Ablation Therapy for Liver Cancer: Chinese Expert Consensus Statement issued by the Chinese Society of Liver Cancer and Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology RFA was performed under real-time ultrasound guidance. RFA was performed by using a commercially available Cool-tipTM RFA system (Valleylab, Boulder, CO, USA), or a RF 2000 system (Radio-Therapeutics Mountain View, CA). Grounding was achieved by attaching 2 pads to the patient's back or legs.</description>

    <description>RFA was performed the same as RFA Arm.Peripheral blood (20-30mL) for manufacturing the individualized highly-purified CTL agent was collected from the respective patients who were randomized to the immunotherapy group before starting treatment. The highly-purified CTL agent was prepared at a central manufacturing facility. Patients in the immunotherapy group received 5*10E9 of the highly-purified CTL agent intravenously over 60 minutes without any premedication and then were observed for at least 30 minutes. They were scheduled to receive highly-purified CTL: 4-6 treatments at a frequency of once two-week during 6 months after receiving RFA, followed by 6-9 treatments during 6 months to 2 years after receiving RFA.</description>
