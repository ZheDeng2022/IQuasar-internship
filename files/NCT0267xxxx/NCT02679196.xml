      Multiple ascending dose study to evaluate safety/tolerability, pharmacokinetic and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics effects of KA2237 (PI3 Kinase p110β/δ Inhibitor) in patients with B Cell&#xD;
      Lymphoma and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in Part I of the study. In Part II,&#xD;
      patients with B cell lymphoma will be treated with KA2237 at the MTD to evaluate safety and&#xD;
      efficacy in the patient population.&#xD;
