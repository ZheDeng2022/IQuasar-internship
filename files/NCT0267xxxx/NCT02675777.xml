    <textblock>
      Alcohol use is the third greatest cause of disability and death for US adults. Care for&#xD;
      unhealthy alcohol use is lacking in most primary care settings. This project will implement&#xD;
      two types of evidence-based care for unhealthy alcohol use in the 25 primary clinics of a&#xD;
      regional health system-Group Health (GH). These include preventive care and treatment.&#xD;
      Preventive care consists of alcohol screening, and for patients who screen positive, brief&#xD;
      patient-centered counseling. Treatment for alcohol use disorders includes offering shared&#xD;
      decision making and motivational counseling designed to enhance engagement in one or more&#xD;
      treatment options: counseling, medications, and/or specialty treatment. During a pilot phase,&#xD;
      the research team at Group Health Research Institute partnered with Group Health leaders and&#xD;
      front line clinicians to design, pilot test, and iteratively refine an implementation&#xD;
      strategy in 3 Group Health primary care clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study uses state-of-the-art implementation strategies to integrate evidence-based&#xD;
      alcohol-related care into 22 primary care clinics (detailed below). This study is a pragmatic&#xD;
      stepped-wedge quality improvement trial to evaluate its impact on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The proportion of patients who have primary care visits who screen positive for&#xD;
           unhealthy alcohol use and have documented annual brief alcohol counseling;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The proportion of patients who have primary care visits who have AUDs identified, and a)&#xD;
           initiate and b) engage in care for AUDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The proportion of patients who have primary care visits who have documented annual&#xD;
           alcohol screening with the AUDIT-C; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The proportion of patients who have primary care visits who screen positive for severe&#xD;
           unhealthy alcohol use and have AUDs assessed and/or diagnosed;&#xD;

      Group Health's Behavioral Health Service leaders decided to implement alcohol-related care&#xD;
      along with integration of population-based primary care for other behavioral health&#xD;
      conditions, including screening for depression, marijuana and other substance use and use&#xD;
      disorders. Group Health leaders also decided to transition primary care social workers to&#xD;
      become integrated behavioral health clinicians in 2015.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot testing of the implementation strategies in 2015 was led by Group Health's Behavioral&#xD;
      Health Service (BHS) in collaboration with other Group Health departments. State-of-the-art&#xD;
      implementation methods were used to integrate evidence-based alcohol-related care into 3&#xD;
      pilot primary care clinics in Group Health. The implementation strategies included:&#xD;
      participatory design, clinical champions, practice facilitation, performance monitoring and&#xD;
      feedback, and clinical decision support in the electronic health record (EHR). The&#xD;
      implementation strategies also included a video and handout designed explicitly to shift&#xD;
      staff attitudes, in order to make discussions of unhealthy alcohol use routine and less&#xD;
      stigmatized in primary care. Screening and follow-up assessment for symptoms of AUDs are&#xD;
      conducted on paper and then typically entered into the EPIC EHR by medical assistants (MAs).&#xD;
      The implementation strategy was refined based on ongoing formative evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group Health leaders are now prepared to roll out behavioral health integration to the&#xD;
      remaining 22 primary care clinics. All implementation will be led and conducted by Group&#xD;
      Health clinical leaders and clinicians. The timing of implementation at the 22 clinics is&#xD;
      staggered to allow for support from practice facilitators. Leaders randomized clinics to&#xD;
      different start dates to allow a rigorous evaluation using secondary quality improvement&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team at Group Health Research Institute is supporting implementation and will&#xD;
      lead the evaluation. The research team will conduct a pragmatic stepped-wedge quality&#xD;
      improvement trial in the 22 primary care clinics. Implementation will be staggered in 7&#xD;
      waves, each of which will be 4 months long (3 waves in Year 1; 4 waves in Years 2-3).&#xD;
      Randomization is stratified by study Year, with 9 sites chosen by Group Health clinical&#xD;
      leaders to start in Year 1, and the 13 remaining sites to be randomized in Year 2.&#xD;
      Randomization is stratified primarily because Group Health clinical leaders wanted to choose&#xD;
      the first 9 clinics. In addition, they may decide remove 3 or 4 facilities in Spokane (a long&#xD;
      distance from Seattle requiring air travel) from the Year 2 randomization (thereby omitting 1&#xD;
      of the 7 waves of implementation Year 2).&#xD;
