      This is a single-arm, single-institution pilot study that will collect preliminary data to be&#xD;
      used in the design of a subsequent study to assess whether changes in fDM (Functional&#xD;
      Diffusion Maps) derived from primary breast cancer diffusion weighted MRI images can serve as&#xD;
      an early predictor of response to treatment, and whether the magnitude of the change&#xD;
      correlates with the effectiveness of treatment.&#xD;

      This trial has a two-step, sequential design, with continuation to the second part of the&#xD;
      trial being dependent on the positive results in the first part. In Part One of the trial,&#xD;
      the investigator will compare intrapatient variability in fDM performed at two timepoints&#xD;
      prior to chemotherapy (chemotherapy will be chosen by the treating physician and will not be&#xD;
      assigned as part of this study), with the change in fDM before and approximately one week&#xD;
      after a dose of chemotherapy, to establish that treatment-related changes in fDM will occur&#xD;
      in this clinical setting. If there are positive results in Part One, then the investigator&#xD;
      will proceed to the second half of the trial. In Part Two, the investigator will examine&#xD;
      changes in fDM that occur one week after each type of chemotherapy is administered, which&#xD;
      will be compared to pathologic response, radiological response, and clinical response.&#xD;

    <description>Percent change in apparent diffusion coefficient was determined by calculating the percentage change between the value prior to chemotherapy and at 8-11 days post treatment for treatment responders (patients with Complete Response [CR] or Partial Response [PR]) and for the treatment non-responders (patients with Stable Disease [SD] or Progressive Disease [PD]).</description>

    <description>All patients will receive a double baseline diffusion weighted MRI (performed on the same day as the Baseline MRI).&#xD;
Patients participating in Part I will receive another MRI approximately 1 week (day 8-11) after the first dose of Chemotherapy (chemotherapy will be determined by the treating physician and is not assigned as part of this trial).&#xD;
Patients participating in Part II will receive a single MRI 1-2 weeks after the first dose of Chemotherapy A (chemotherapy will be determined by the treating physician and is not assigned as part of this trial). A second MRI will be repeated within 2 weeks prior to the start of Chemotherapy B.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a primary measurable, biopsy proven, invasive breast carcinoma with&#xD;
             the primary tumor intact. The tumor should be staged clinically as T2-T4 (minimum size&#xD;
             &gt;2.0 cm).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a breast tumor that is resectable or potentially resectable&#xD;
             following neoadjuvant chemotherapy and be willing to undergo resection, if indicated,&#xD;
             after chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not have received prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy for their&#xD;
             current breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not have had a clip placed into the tumor that is not compatible with&#xD;
             MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be deemed eligible for neoadjuvant chemotherapy, as assessed by the&#xD;
             clinical investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt; 18 years.&#xD;

             Performance Status: an attempt to quantify cancer patients' general well-being and&#xD;
             activities of daily life. The score ranges from 0 to 5 where 0 is asymptomatic and 5&#xD;
             is death.) of 0 - 1.&#xD;
&#xD;

             Patients who require sedation with general anesthesia to complete an MRI are not&#xD;
             eligible for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may have no ferrous metal implants or medical devices which would exclude&#xD;
             MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be capable of lying flat in an MRI magnet for 30-60 minutes on 4&#xD;
