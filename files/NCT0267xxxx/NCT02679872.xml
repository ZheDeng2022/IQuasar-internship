      Good non-technical skills (NTS) have been shown to prevent adverse events and errors.&#xD;
      Improvements of NTS can be achieved by simulation based-team training.The NTS of the&#xD;
      operating theatre team performing video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is speculated&#xD;
      to differ fra open thoracic surgery, as is the case with technical skills; however, these&#xD;
      have not been investigated. The aim of this study is to explore which NTS the members of the&#xD;
      VATS team perceive to be most important to patient care and safety. Exploration will be done&#xD;
      through a deductive, qualitative analysis of semi-structured group and individual interviews&#xD;
      with VATS team members. A theoretical perspective of Hollnagels Safety-II will be taken using&#xD;
      the taxonomy of Oxford Non-Technical Skills (NOTECHS) system with the aim of informing&#xD;
      patient safety.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-technical skills (NTS) can be defined as 'the cognitive, social and personal resource&#xD;
      skills that complement technical skills, and contribute to safe and efficient task&#xD;
      performance'. Human errors, such as communication breakdowns, lack of speaking up and of good&#xD;
      leadership, are known to contribute considerably to adverse events. Adverse events are common&#xD;
      in the operating theatre affecting patient safety. Adaptive behaviours have been shown&#xD;
      important as a response to the dynamic, complex world of the operating theatre to prevent&#xD;
      potential problems and adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As with technical skills, NTS can be taught by team training. Team training have been shown&#xD;
      to improve attitudes as well as NTS, and reduced technical errors. Large studies have&#xD;
      additionally shown that team training can reduce adverse events and improve patient outcome.&#xD;
      A training intervention targeted at operating theatre teams will need to start with an&#xD;
      assessment uncovering the learning needs of the team members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is shown to be more complex, involve more&#xD;
      personnel and take longer time than open surgery. The technical skills are different, among&#xD;
      other things due to complex equipment and two-dimensional vision of a three-dimensional&#xD;
      operating space. In our systematic review (submitted), only few studies investigated the NTS&#xD;
      in MIS teams. The communication in MIS compared to open surgery were found to be different,&#xD;
      relating more to equipment and patient related topics. Working in fixed teams improved&#xD;
      teamwork climate in MIS teams.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correspondingly, the NTS of the video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) operating team is&#xD;
      speculated to differ from the NTS needed in open surgery as is the case with the technical&#xD;
      skills. However, no studies investigated the NTS of VATS teams.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to explore, which NTS the members of the VATS team perceive to be&#xD;
      most important to high quality patient care and patient safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frameworks/theory:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The theoretical conceptual framework for the study is the safety theory by Erik Hollnagel,&#xD;
      named Safety-I and Safety-II, arguing for a new view on safety: Safety-II. In Safety-I, the&#xD;
      ontology is that things either function or malfunction, that could be a piece of equipment or&#xD;
      healthcare professionals following procedures or guidelines. Consequently, the aetiology of&#xD;
      the outcomes can be explained by a cause-effect relationship, where the malfunction of things&#xD;
      linearly cause an unwanted effect. The resulting phenomenology then refers to outcomes as&#xD;
      adverse events / incidents/ accidents. Oppositely, in Safety-II, the ontology is that in&#xD;
      socio-technical systems, such as the healthcare system, performance adjustments is needed to&#xD;
      adjust work, that is the task and the tools, to the actual situation of the complex world.&#xD;
      Hence, as the technology only can vary to a limited extent, human performance needs to vary.&#xD;
      The aetiological explanation in Safety-II is therefore, that performance variability resonate&#xD;
      through both proactive and reactive adjustments into observed outcomes, named emergent&#xD;
      outcomes. The resulting phenomenology sees the performance variability as both the basis of&#xD;
      adverse events and of acceptable outcomes; that is everyday activities. These performance&#xD;
      adjustments can be categorised into three types of adjustments: Maintaining/creating,&#xD;
      compensating and avoiding, thereby characterising the performance variability for a specific&#xD;
      activity. In all, the starting point is turned around. In Safety-II, the focus is on why and&#xD;
      how things go right with the aim of understanding everyday activities, termed 'Work-as-Done',&#xD;
      in contrast to the less interesting written procedure guidelines etc., termed&#xD;
      'Work-as-Imagined'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within non-technical skills research and education in healthcare, and especially within the&#xD;
      specialities working in the operating theatre, a taxonomy widely used is the framework of&#xD;
      behavioural markers adapted from the aviation industry, termed the Oxford Non-Technical&#xD;
      Skills (NOTECHS) system. This framework is structured around four categories, divided into&#xD;
      several elements each represented by examples of good or poor behavioural markers. This&#xD;
      system has been developed and evaluated for operating teams and assesses both the team and&#xD;
      each subteam's NTS. In this study, the taxonomy of the NOTECHS system in the perspective of&#xD;
      the conceptual theory of Safety-II will be used as framework for the data analysis as&#xD;
      described in detail below. In all, the behavioural markers representing good behaviours will&#xD;
      therefore be the focus of this study to explore how things go right as this is much often the&#xD;
      case than not. Interviewing the actual VATS team members themselves will explore their own&#xD;
      perception of the NTS used in their everyday activities including the needed adaptions to&#xD;
      situational requirements, found by others. This will represent 'Work-as-Done' rather than&#xD;
      'Work-as-Imagined' with the aim of informing the Safety-II perspective on patient safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will use the theories described above in an explorative semi-structured interview&#xD;
      study. The data collection and thereby sample size will be an iterative process until no new&#xD;
      data is revealed, hence saturation is met. This will include interviews of both&#xD;
      multi-professional teams and individuals depending on the data revealed during the&#xD;
      interviewing-analysing process. Interviews will be conducted by KG and ASM using a&#xD;
      semi-structured interview guide. The interview guide will be adjusted during the iterative&#xD;
      process of interviews and analysis. All interviews will be audio-recorded and transcribed&#xD;
      verbatim. The study will be reported in accordance with the Standards for Reporting&#xD;
      Qualitative Research (SRQR). Quality and rigour will be aimed for as suggested for&#xD;
      qualitative research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Regional Scientific Ethics Committee of the Capital Region will be applied; however, we&#xD;
      expect a letter of exemption due to Danish laws on educational studies not involving&#xD;
      patients. Participants will receive oral and written information and will have to give&#xD;
      informed consent with the continuous option of retracting their consent and participation.&#xD;
      Personal data will be stored according to Danish Data Protection Law, and will be presented&#xD;
      anonymously. The study protocol will be registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants, setting and time:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be purposefully sampled as subject matter experts in terms of VATS&#xD;
      operating teams in conjunction with individuals. The teams will consist of one or two&#xD;
      surgeon(s) with VATS experience, one younger assisting surgeon, one anaesthesiologist, one&#xD;
      nurse anaesthetist, and one to two scrub nurses with experience as both assisting and&#xD;
      circulating nurse. The individuals will be relevant healthcare professionals of any of the&#xD;
      above. Participants will come from the four university hospitals performing VATS in Denmark&#xD;
      in collaboration with head of departments. Each person will only be included in one team&#xD;
      interview and/or one individual interview. The interviews are planned to be conducted in&#xD;
      February and March 2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interview guide:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interview guide will be semi-structured with a scripted introduction before each&#xD;
      interview setting the scene and the topic of the interview. The interview will try to explore&#xD;
      all four NOTECHS categories, namely leadership &amp; management, teamwork &amp; co-operation,&#xD;
      problem-solving &amp; decision-making, and situation awareness in a Safety-II perspective,&#xD;
      focusing on the performance variability of the team members needed in their daily work to&#xD;
      adapt to situational requirements. Emphasis will be laid on allowing all team members to give&#xD;
      their perspective in order to explore views of the entire team. The interviews will be&#xD;
      semi-structured so probe questions will be used when necessary to obtain additional&#xD;
      information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to conducting the interviews, two authors (KG, ASM) will spend a number of hours&#xD;
      observing VATS procedures in order to become familiar with the procedures and with any&#xD;
      critical phases of the operations. This, along with input from experienced VATS surgeons&#xD;
      (RHP, HJH) and an experienced anaesthesiologist (DO), will inform the interview guide. The&#xD;
      interview guide will be internally reviewed by the authors consisting of surgeons, a scrub&#xD;
      nurse and an anaesthesiologist that are experienced qualitative and NTS researchers. It will&#xD;
      be pilot tested on healthcare professionals without specific NTS knowledge to avoid&#xD;
      misunderstanding and misinterpretation; however, these data will not be included in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interviews will be conducted face-to-face in undisturbed rooms in relation to the&#xD;
      operating theatre in or just after normal working hours depending on working schedule. The&#xD;
      participants demographic data will be collected consisting of profession, age, gender, years&#xD;
      of clinical experience, years and type of experience with laparoscopic or VATS procedures and&#xD;
      previous experience with NTS training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A deductive data analysis strategy will be applied in this study. With the taxonomy of the&#xD;
      NOTECHS framework we will use directed content analysis to analyse the interviews. Directed&#xD;
      content analysis can be applied when 'prior research exists about a phenomenon that is&#xD;
      incomplete/would benefit from further description'. As we approach the topic from a Safety-II&#xD;
      perspective, focus will be on which behaviours the VATS team members perceive as important in&#xD;
      insuring that things go right thereby insuring high quality patient care and patient safety.&#xD;
      Explicitly we will focus on performance variability in their everyday work, categorising them&#xD;
      as either maintaining/creating, compensating or avoiding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The strategy is to use the categories of NOTECHS as well as categories of performance&#xD;
      variability, when reading the transcribed interviews. The text will then be coded into these&#xD;
      categories for condensation, adding new ones when extra text of interest is uncovered in&#xD;
      order to avoid missing important new information that could inform the theory on NTS in VATS&#xD;
      teams. The text coded will be marked to adhere to one of the categories, introducing new&#xD;
      categories if needed. The texts will then be paraphrased to condense the interview quotations&#xD;
      into observable behavioural examples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analyses will be conducted by KG and ASM. The first interviews will be coded by both KG&#xD;
      and ASM; the coding will be discussed between these two and LS/DO. When agreement is&#xD;
      satisfactorily, the two authors will split up and code the remaining interviews&#xD;
      independently. The results of the coding will be discussed with LS/DO and later the full&#xD;
      group of authors. The analysis will be conducted using NVivo (version 10).&#xD;
