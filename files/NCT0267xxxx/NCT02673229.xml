  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      By doing this study, researchers hope to learn if applying Santyl to the burn during the&#xD;
      healing process affects the appearance of the resulting scar.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects who have minor, second degree burns may be enrolled in this study. Subjects will&#xD;
      receive either Santyl ointment or bacitracin ointment to apply to the burn until it heals.&#xD;
      Bandages will be used to keep the burn covered while it heals. Second degree burns generally&#xD;
      leave a scar. Once the burn heals, lotion and an appropriate bandage will be used to try to&#xD;
      minimize the appearance of a scar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is that burns treated with Santyl will have a better scar appearance&#xD;
      than burns treated with bacitracin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects enrolled in this study will make once a week visits to the University of Kansas&#xD;
      Medical Center outpatient burn clinic until the burn heals. The burn will be assessed for&#xD;
      healing at these visits. Once healed, visits to the clinic will be at 60 &amp; 180 days, up to 6&#xD;
      months. At these visits, the appearance of the scar will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was originally funded by Smith and Nephew, but Smith and Nephew is no longer&#xD;
      providing support for the study.&#xD;
