  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are doing a study to learn how to support patients aged 60+ in taking more&#xD;
      breaks from sitting. The goal of the study is to find out if using commercially available&#xD;
      devices are helpful in reducing sitting time.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To date, no one has tested whether the prompting features of commercially available&#xD;
      wrist-worn devices (e.g., Jawbone Up) improve breaks from sitting. Single case designs are a&#xD;
      cost-effective way to conduct a controlled, randomized study that can inform larger&#xD;
      intervention trials. Because the investigators are interested in ascertaining the effect of a&#xD;
      very specific intervention on a very specific/single outcome, this study is well-suited to&#xD;
      this approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct iterative single case experimental studies using randomization&#xD;
      tests. This design can help evaluate technologies for behavior change. To increase&#xD;
      statistical power, the investigators opted to conduct an ABA study design (also termed a&#xD;
      reversal design) where A is baseline and B is an intervention. Using randomization tests, the&#xD;
      length of each A and B phase are determined to vary randomly in length prior to the beginning&#xD;
      of each participant's experiment. The investigators will constrain the total time of each A&#xD;
      and B phase to last a minimum of 5 days to provide adequate exposure to the A (measurement&#xD;
      only) and B (intervention) conditions. The maximum total number of days participants will be&#xD;
      enrolled is 28.&#xD;
