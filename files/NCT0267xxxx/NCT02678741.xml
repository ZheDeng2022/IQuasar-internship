  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Assess the safety and tumor response of utilizing an autologous tumor lysate,&#xD;
      particle-loaded, dendritic cell (TLPLDC) vaccine given in combination with standard of care&#xD;
      (SoC) checkpoint inhibitors (CPI) in patients with stage IV melanoma with measurable disease.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Metastatic melanoma patients eligible for (or currently on) CPI therapy per SoC will be&#xD;
      identified and screened for inclusion/exclusion criteria. Eligible patients will be counseled&#xD;
      and consented for tissue procurement. They will undergo excisional or core needle biopsy as&#xD;
      clinically indicated and this tissue will be shipped in liquid nitrogen shippers through&#xD;
      FedEx to our central facility in Greenville, SC.The tumor will be stored frozen until vaccine&#xD;
      preparation. Vaccine development requires 48 hours for preparation. Upon verification that&#xD;
      adequate tissue was obtained, these patients will then be counseled and consented for&#xD;
      participation in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients who qualify for participation in this trial will continue their treatment of&#xD;
      CPI. Once consented, patients will receive a single injection of Neupogen (G-CSF) 300 μg SQ&#xD;
      24-48 hrs prior to having 70 mL of blood collected and sent to our central facility for DC&#xD;
      isolation and preparation. Those who cannot tolerate Neupogen or refuse it will have 120 mL&#xD;
      of blood drawn and sent. Additional blood may be drawn if additional vaccine doses need to be&#xD;
      made or re-made for any reason. Vaccines will be prepared by producing TL through freeze/thaw&#xD;
      cycling and then loaded into pre-prepared YCWP. The TL-loaded YCWP will be introduced to the&#xD;
      DC for phagocytosis thus creating the TLPLDC vaccine, which will be frozen in single dose&#xD;
      vials. Each vial will contain 1 x 106 TLPLDC and will be labeled with the patient's unique&#xD;
      study number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The frozen autologous TLPLDC will be sent back to the site with a total of 6 single dose&#xD;
      vials after the vaccine has completed QA/QC testing and lot-release (usually 3 weeks). The&#xD;
      primary vaccination series will include monthly inoculations at 0, 1, 2, 3 months followed by&#xD;
      boosters at 6 and 9 months in the same lymph node draining area (preferably the anterior&#xD;
      thigh). Once received, the first inoculation should occur within 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety data will be collected on local and systemic toxicities and graded and reported per&#xD;
      the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.03.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will follow-up at their respective sites for evaluation of metastatic disease per&#xD;
      SoC. They will under imaging, CT/PET-CT, to meet Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors&#xD;
      (RECIST) criteria version 1.1 and iRECIST to monitor disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood (50 mL) will be collected from all patients prior to each inoculation and at 12 months&#xD;
      from enrollment for a total of 7 time points or a total of 350 mL of blood over 1 year. The&#xD;
      collected blood will be sent to our central facility for immunologic testing of T-cell&#xD;
      responses.&#xD;
