  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory, debilitating disease that causes&#xD;
      destruction of central nervous system (CNS) myelin, with varying degrees of axonal damage. It&#xD;
      mainly affects young adults and is twice as common in women as in men (1). Studies published&#xD;
      from the 1990s brought animal models and theoretical considerations of hematopoietic stem&#xD;
      cell transplantation (HSCT) being useful in the prevention and treatment of autoimmune&#xD;
      diseases, with clinical responses in some patients, suggesting that high-dose chemotherapy&#xD;
      followed by HSCT rescue could &quot;reset&quot; the immunological changes through the control of&#xD;
      autoreactive clones, followed by immunological tolerance after immune reconstitution (2);&#xD;
      this led to the conclusion that HSCT may be a viable therapeutic option for MS (1-6).&#xD;
      Autologous HSCT have been done in patients with MS since 1996 and more than 700 HSCTs have&#xD;
      been performed around the world (1-6). Most patients have been treated in small trials or in&#xD;
      multicenter studies. In retrospective analyzes, a progression-free survival of more than five&#xD;
      years after transplant has been observed, the neurological outcomes being considerably more&#xD;
      favorable in patients with the relapsing-remitting type and/or those who showed an&#xD;
      inflammatory pattern in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) during the pre-transplant screening.&#xD;
      Reports of good results, particularly in the aggressive forms of MS reinforce the&#xD;
      effectiveness HSCT in MS patients with prominent inflammatory activity. The risk of&#xD;
      transplant related mortality in HSCT for MS was conventionally considered very high but has&#xD;
      declined since 2001 to 1.3% (2-6), this probably being the result of the changes in the&#xD;
      conditioning regimens, thus reducing toxicity. Recent data, with more than 700 autologous&#xD;
      transplants for MS in Europe, showed an overall survival of 92% in five years and a&#xD;
      progression-free survival of 46%, the main cause of mortality and morbidity being the&#xD;
      recurrence of the autoimmune disease (2-6). The consensus provides an indication of HSCT in&#xD;
      patients with progressive MS unresponsive to conventional therapy and Expanded Disability&#xD;
      Status Scale (EDSS) (1) between 3.0 and 6.0. The forms of the disease that might benefit from&#xD;
      transplantation are: relapsing remitting, primary or secondary progressive, and the&#xD;
      &quot;malignant&quot; form, provided there is evidence of inflammatory activity at the time of&#xD;
      transplant indication.&#xD;

      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory, debilitating disease that causes&#xD;

      Reports of good results, particularly in the aggressive forms of MS reinforce the&#xD;
      effectiveness HSCT in MS patients with prominent inflammatory activity. The risk of&#xD;
      transplant related mortality in HSCT for MS was conventionally considered very high but has&#xD;

      recurrence of the autoimmune disease (2-6). The consensus provides an indication of HSCT in&#xD;
      patients with progressive MS unresponsive to conventional therapy and Expanded Disability&#xD;
      Status Scale (EDSS) (1) between 3.0 and 6.0. The forms of the disease that might benefit from&#xD;
      transplantation are: relapsing remitting, primary or secondary progressive, and the&#xD;
      &quot;malignant&quot; form, provided there is evidence of inflammatory activity at the time of&#xD;
      transplant indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since 1993 our group has engaged in practicing HSCT using novel methods to both decrease the&#xD;
      toxicity of the procedures and diminish costs (7-14); we have done over 400 HSCT for&#xD;
      different diseases such as acute leukemia, chronic leukemia, aplastic anemia, myeloma,&#xD;
      lymphoma, myelodysplasia and autoimmune diseases, including MS. Within the subset of&#xD;
      autologous HSCT, the salient features of our method is that we conduct them on an outpatient&#xD;
      basis (8-9, 15-16) and we avoid freezing and thawing the hematopoietic cells in order to both&#xD;
      increase viability of hematopoietic cells in the graft and to reduce costs (8-9, 15-16) and&#xD;
      we always employ peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC). All these changes have turned the&#xD;
      practice of autografting in our hands in an affordable procedure which can be offered to&#xD;
      individuals living in underprivileged circumstances such as those prevailing in developing&#xD;
      countries (17). Having gained experience autografting hematological malignancies (8-9, 15) we&#xD;
      aim to engage in a program of grafting non-cryopreserved autologous hematopoietic stem cells&#xD;
      in patients with MS, employing a modification of the autografting conditioning regimen used&#xD;
      in malignant diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients with MS refered to our center for a HSCT will be prospectively entered in the&#xD;
           study. Individuals with a relapsing-remitting (RRMS) course, secondary progressive&#xD;
           (SPMS) or primary progressive (PPMS). Patients should have a Karnofsky performance&#xD;
           status (18) above 70% and a EDSS score (1) of 6 or below. The study has been approved by&#xD;
           the Ethics Committee of the Clinic Ruiz and all patients sign a consent form after being&#xD;
           fully informed about procedure an possible complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Peripheral blood stem cell mobilization and apheresis:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The PBSC mobilization schedule was done with cyclophospha- mide (Cy) and filgrastim&#xD;
           (granulocyte colony stimulating factor, G-CSF). Intravenous Cy (50 mg/kg) was delivered&#xD;
           in a 120-min period on days -11 and -10. Subcutaneous G-CSF (10 μg/kg/b.i.d.) was&#xD;
           delivered on days -9 to -1. Using either a peripheral vein or a Majurkar-type subclavian&#xD;
           catheter, the apheresis procedure was performed on day -2, using an Amicus machine&#xD;
           (Fresenius Kabi, Deerfield, IL, USA) or a Spectra Optia machine (Terumo BCT, Lakewood,&#xD;
           CO, USA) and the Spin-Nebraska protocol [19]. The apheresis objective was to reach at&#xD;
           least 1 × 106 viable CD34+ cells/ kg. CD34+ cells in peripheral blood were not measured&#xD;
           before the apheresis procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Conditioning and autografting:&#xD;
&#xD;
           As outpatients, intravenous Cy (50 mg(Kg) delivered along a 120 minute period on days&#xD;
           -11, -10 , - 2 and - 1 followed by MESNA (1000 mg/m2 along a 180-minute period),&#xD;
           ondansetron 8 mg, dexamethasone 4 mg and pantoprazole 40 mg. After the intravenous Cy,&#xD;
           ondansetron (4 mg every 12 h after chemotherapy), oral cotrimoxazol (800 / 160 mg every&#xD;
           24 h), oral fluconazole (200 mg) and oral acyclovir (400 mg every 12 h) will be used in&#xD;
           all patients until granulocytes were greater than 0.5 x 109/L; in this period all&#xD;
           patients will have laboratory workup and clinical studies every 48 h. After the recovery&#xD;
           of the granulocytes, patients will be given rituximab (1000 mg total dose along a 3 h&#xD;
           period), and in the following six months, cotrimoxazol 800/160 mg bid three times a&#xD;
           week, acyclovir 800 mg daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Apheresis product preservation, studies and infusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The products of the apheresis and 1 ml aliquots were kept in ACD-A (Baxter Healthcare,&#xD;
      Deerfield IL) at 4oC, in 300 ml transfer packs (Baxter Healthcare, Deerfield IL) composed of&#xD;
      gas impermeable, polyvinyl chloride plastic film for up to 72 hours. Enumeration of the total&#xD;
      white mononuclear cells (MNC) and CD34 positive cells is done by flow-cytometry (20) in an&#xD;
      EPICS Elite ESP apparatus (Coulter Electronics, Hialeah, FL), using for the latter&#xD;
      subpopulation the anti-CD34 monoclonal antibody HPCA-2 (Becton Dickinson, San José CA),&#xD;
      gating in propidium iodide-excluding CD45(+) MNC population according to forward and 90°&#xD;
      angle light scattering. Additional viability studies of the MNC uses propidium iodide&#xD;
      exclusion and anti-cell antibodies on a flow cytometer. No purging procedures are performed.&#xD;
      The apheresis products obtained on days - 2 and - 1 are reinfused to the patients on days 0&#xD;
      and +1 respectively after keeping them in the conventional blood bank refrigerator.&#xD;
