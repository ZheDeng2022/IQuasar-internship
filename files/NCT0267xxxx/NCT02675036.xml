      The purpose of this study is to see whether extraction of the primary canine tooth or&#xD;
      extraction of both the primary canine - and the primary first molar tooth is most effective&#xD;
      in the treatment of palatally ectopic canine teeth in the maxilla. In addition the study will&#xD;
      also measure pain and discomfort in relation to these two treatment alternatives.&#xD;

      Study objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the effectiveness of concomitant extraction of the maxillary deciduous canine&#xD;
           and maxillary deciduous first molar as compared to extraction of the deciduous maxillary&#xD;
           canine only as an interceptive measure for improving the eruption path of ectopic&#xD;
           maxillary canines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate whether there is a difference in the use of analgesics, pain and discomfort&#xD;
           between the two treatment groups in 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After informed consent patients will randomly be assigned to one of two groups. Group1:&#xD;
      Extraction of the deciduous canine only Group 2: Extraction of both the deciduous canine and&#xD;
      the deciduous first molar&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization The block randomization method will be used. Block sizes will randomly vary&#xD;
      from 2, 4, 6 and 8. Blocks will be generated from free software at&#xD;
      http://www.randomization.com . Allocation concealment is done by enclosing assignments into&#xD;
      sequentially numbered envelopes. Envelopes that will have to be torn to open will be used.&#xD;
      The randomization process will be done by a staff member at TkNN that is not involved in the&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to extractions topical anesthetics will be given for two minutes, before the buccal and&#xD;
      palatal infiltration of local anesthetic (1,8 ml dose, 20mg/ml lidocain with 12,5 g/ml&#xD;
      epinephrine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and parents will be given oral postoperative information, including a recommendation&#xD;
      to use non-prescription analgesics at their own discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical and Radiographic controls and evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be controlled clinically and radiographically (DPT) after 6 and 12 months. If&#xD;
      improvement is not detectable after 12 months, alternative treatment will be suggested&#xD;
      (surgical exposure, fixed orthodontic appliances, extractions). All cases which do not need&#xD;
      alternative approaches will be followed until the tooth is erupted in the mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sector, alpha angle and d-distance will be measured on DPT-images&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dental anxiety Before any extractions are performed each patient will answer the modified&#xD;
      dental anxiety scale (MDAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain and discomfort When the patients have performed their extractions they will receive two&#xD;
      questionnaires, regarding pain and discomfort and use of analgesics, to fulfill at home and&#xD;
      return by mail. The first part shall be answered the first evening as the extraction was&#xD;
      performed and the second part should be answered one week post extraction.&#xD;
