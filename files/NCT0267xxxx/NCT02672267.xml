  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of&#xD;
      human allogeneic ischemia tolerant mesenchymal bone marrow cells (aLoOxMBMC) administered&#xD;
      intravenously to subjects with Acute Myocardial Infarction (STEMI, non STEMI).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality despite&#xD;
      continuing advances in various treatment options. In developed countries, ischemic heart&#xD;
      disease causes more than 50% of all cardiovascular deaths.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stem cell transplantation has the potential to repair and improve cardiac function, thus&#xD;
      helping to significantly decrease morbidity and mortality rates. Preclinical data from a&#xD;
      variety of animal studies demonstrated the capacity for skeletal myoblasts to engraft, form&#xD;
      myotubules, and enhance cardiac function after transplantation into infarcted myocardium. The&#xD;
      underlying sequela of the post infarcted left ventricle often includes massive damage to the&#xD;
      cardiomyocyte. The left ventricle remodeling (dilation) and dysfunction is thought to be&#xD;
      irreversible. The development of treatments that will regenerate its musculature and vascular&#xD;
      components is now considered a main therapeutic challenge. Preliminary human studies focusing&#xD;
      on subjects with ischemic heart disease have demonstrated successful myoblast transplantation&#xD;
      into the post infarction scar. Another study demonstrated the benefits of stem cell therapy&#xD;
      on ventricular function and profusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells have been used in a number of clinical trials for different&#xD;
      indications. These clinical trials showed excellent safety, reduction in arrhythmias,&#xD;
      improvement in functional status and increased ejection fraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hMSCs are able to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Prevent reperfusion injury;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Prevent excessive fibrosis;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Reestablish function of hibernating cardiomyocytes in peripheral zone area.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Reestablish angiogenesis/vasculogenesis;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Preserve wall motion (prevent arrhythmia and functional contractile deterioration);&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Prevent post infarct ventricular remodeling and left ventricular dilation. It is well&#xD;
           accepted that dilated cardiomyopathy mortality rates are 50% within 5 years of&#xD;
           diagnosis;&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Limit infarct size. If we can preserve and restore cardiac function as measured by&#xD;
           ejection fraction and LVESV preserving left ventricular integrity would increase subject&#xD;
           quality of life as well as longevity.&#xD;
