  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is currently a major health problem in the UK. Despite being one of the most&#xD;
      common cancers, lung cancer has a poor prognosis compared to other types of cancer and is the&#xD;
      leading cause of cancer death in the world. As opposed to other organs, the lung is highly&#xD;
      susceptible to inflammatory insults, for example from bacterial infection-induced and&#xD;
      tobacco-induced inflammation. It has long been known that the cellular microenvironment that&#xD;
      nurtures tumour growth and development is linked to sites of chronic inflammation but&#xD;
      molecular insights into how external inflammation boosts or inhibits cancer in the lungs&#xD;
      remains unclear. This study aims to directly visualise the expression of a well known marker&#xD;
      of cancerous tissue, c-MET, and the activity of neutrophils in human lung cancer in vivo in&#xD;
      situ using fibre-based endomicroscopy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to directly deliver a microdose of two optical imaging&#xD;
      agents to 20 patients with suspected or confirmed lung cancer to assess whether the agents&#xD;
      can detect c-MET expression and neutrophil activity in human lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is to visualise the delivery of these imaging agents to assess imaging&#xD;
      parameters in patients with suspected or diagnosed lung cancer using a novel delivery&#xD;
      catheter, imaging fibre and fibre-based endomicroscopy system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol will involve two cohorts of patients; Cohort 1 will include patients scheduled&#xD;
      for resection of their lung cancer and Cohort 2 will be patients with suspected inoperable&#xD;
      stage 3/4 lung cancer scheduled for a diagnostic bronchoscopy followed by therapy. For both&#xD;
      cohorts, eligibility will be verified by a clinical trial physician after written informed&#xD;
      consent has been obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fibre-based endomicroscopy (FE) will be performed and up to 100μg of both optical imaging&#xD;
      agents will be instilled during a bronchoscopy procedure. CT identified regions of&#xD;
      architecturally normal lung in all participants will act as internal controls and will be&#xD;
      used to compare the signal in normal and diseased lung tissue. Tissue samples taken from both&#xD;
      cohorts will be collected for ex vivo validation including immunohistochemistry, zymography&#xD;
      and genomic screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cardiorespiratory exam, chest x ray and routine observations will be performed 4-6 hours&#xD;
      following the administration of both imaging agents. All participants will be visited by a&#xD;
      member of the research team 24 hours (± 4 hours) after dosing to ensure no adverse events&#xD;
      were experienced. All participants in Cohort 1 will complete the study when the 24 hour&#xD;
      assessment has been successfully completed and all adverse events have been resolved.&#xD;
      Participants in Cohort 2 will be invited back for a second bronchoscopy following the first&#xD;
      round of their therapy to investigate whether the expression of c-MET or the level of&#xD;
      neutrophil activity has changed. All participants in Cohort 2 will complete the study when&#xD;
      the second 24 hour assessment has been successfully completed and all adverse events have&#xD;
      been resolved.&#xD;
