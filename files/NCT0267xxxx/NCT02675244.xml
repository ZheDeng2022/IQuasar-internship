  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the research is to determine whether repairing a tricuspid valve (TV) in&#xD;
      patients with mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation (TR), at the time of planned mitral&#xD;
      valve surgery (MVS), would improve the heart health of those who receive it compared to those&#xD;
      who do not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this point, the medical community is split in their opinion on whether surgeons should&#xD;
      routinely repair mild to moderate TR in patients who are undergoing planned mitral valve&#xD;
      surgery, and this study will answer this question.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The tricuspid valve controls the flow of blood in your heart between the right ventricle and&#xD;
      the right atrium. TR is a condition where the valve does not close fully when it is supposed&#xD;
      to and blood can then leak back into the right atrium. When TR becomes severe, surgery is&#xD;
      usually performed to correct it. The purpose of the research is to determine whether&#xD;
      repairing a tricuspid valve in patients with mild to moderate TR, at the time of planned&#xD;
      mitral valve surgery, would improve the heart health of those who receive it compared to&#xD;
      those who do not. There are no new or &quot;experimental&quot; procedures being tested in this study:&#xD;
      both the mitral valve procedure and the tricuspid valve repair procedure are well established&#xD;
      surgeries and are regularly performed together in patients who have severe TR. The available&#xD;
      evidence addressing this issue is not definite: it is based on less rigorous methods of&#xD;
      investigation, and the results have been conflicting. The study being proposed here will use&#xD;
      rigorous scientific methods and should result in a very high level of certainty about what&#xD;
      surgical treatment is best for patients with your condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll people scheduled for mitral valve surgery with mild to moderate&#xD;
      tricuspid regurgitation.&#xD;
