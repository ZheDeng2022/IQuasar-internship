      The aim of this study is to assess cutaneous healing process under LED exposition on 10&#xD;
      healthy subjects pre-treated with fractional CO2 laser on mini-zones on forearms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cutaneous healing is a physiological process that occurs in many occasions: posttraumatic,&#xD;
      post-burn, but also in postsurgery or aesthetic interventions. Most often, topical products&#xD;
      are used to create a favorable environment for wound healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LED (Light Emitting Diode) are light emitting diodes which produce monochromatic or&#xD;
      non-coherent polychromatic radiation when an electric current passes through them. Some LED&#xD;
      emitting wavelengths in the visible or near infrared have been reported to promote wound&#xD;
      healing. In the literature, in vitro studies showed stimulation of fibroblast and&#xD;
      keratinocyte proliferation under the effect of irradiation by the LED. Animal studies have&#xD;
      also shown that some LED treatments were able to stimulate healing and angiogenesis. Despite&#xD;
      existence of strong data in in vitro and animal studies, the clinical data in humans&#xD;
      regarding wound healing are still very poor. Thus, it is still not clear whether the LEDs&#xD;
      have a real interest in skin healing, and if so, what are the wavelengths and optimal&#xD;
      parameters. Despite this, the LEDs are used widely, unfortunately without a clear&#xD;
      demonstration of their effectiveness and without any determination of optimal parameters of&#xD;
      treatments that could guide clinicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy at day 3 of different parameters&#xD;
      of LED to enhance wound healing after dermabrasion with CO2 fractional laser on mini-zones on&#xD;
      10 healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  screening visit (day-7 to day-21): information of the patient, verification of inclusion&#xD;
           criteria , preselection of 7 mini-zones, collection of the informed consent. Clinical&#xD;
           examination, vital signs. Pregnancy test for women old enough to procreate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  V1 (inclusion): clinical examination, vital signs, new pregnancy test for the women old&#xD;
           enough to procreate, randomization for the allocation of treatments (LED parameters) on&#xD;
           7 mini-zones of 1,5x1,5 cm at the level of forearm, one of them is allocated to control&#xD;
           ( only laser). Dermabrasion by fractional laser CO2 ablative, evaluation of the pain on&#xD;
           every zone by VAS post-act. Exposition to LED (630nm, 830nm and 590 nm). Water loss&#xD;
           measure and colorimetry before and after laser and after the exposition to LED. Clinical&#xD;
           evaluation of local tolerance post-laser and post-LED + standardized photographs.&#xD;
           Application of a healing cream twice a day on area treated until healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  V2 (24 hours): evaluation local tolerance, photos, colorimetry, waterloss measure before&#xD;
           the session LED.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  V3 (48 hours): evaluation local tolerance, photos, colorimetry, waterloss measure before&#xD;
           the session LED&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  V4 (72 hours): clinical exam, clinical local tolerance evaluation and healing, waterloss&#xD;
           measure, colorimetry and standardized photos&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  V5 ( J7): evaluation local tolerance, colorimetry and waterloss measures, standardized&#xD;
           photos . V6 (J21+/-3 days): clinical exam, clinical local tolerance evaluation and&#xD;
           healing, waterloss measure, colorimetry and standardized photos. Final visit of the&#xD;
           study&#xD;
