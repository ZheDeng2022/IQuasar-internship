  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This purpose study is to demonstrate the safety and performance of the DAISe System used to&#xD;
      remove clot in the brain during a stroke. This study will assess how well the device removes&#xD;
      clot from the brain and how well patients recover from their stroke. This study plans to&#xD;
      enroll 100 study patients at up to 10 hospitals in Europe. Study patients are followed for 3&#xD;
      months after the procedure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, multi-center, single arm study that will enroll a maximum of 90&#xD;
      subjects, plus up to 50 roll-in subjects. A maximum of 10 sites in Europe will be involved in&#xD;
      this study. The primary performance endpoint is successful revascularization defined as TICI&#xD;
      2b-3 flow in the target vessel post-treatment of up to three passes with the DAISe System.&#xD;
      The primary safety endpoint is symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage at 24 hours&#xD;
      post-procedure as detected by CT/MRI with an NIHSS change of &gt;/=4. Subject will be followed&#xD;
      through hospital discharge with a visit at Day 1 post procedure, Day 7 or prior to&#xD;
      discharge/transfer, 30 days and 3 months.&#xD;

             judgement.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Evidence of dissection in the carotid or middle cerebral arteries.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Cerebral vasculitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Suspicion of aortic dissection, presumed septic embolus or suspicion of bacterial&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Clinical symptoms suggestive of bilateral stroke or occlusions in multiple vascular&#xD;
             territories (e.g., bilateral anterior circulation, or anterior/posterior circulation).&#xD;
&#xD;
