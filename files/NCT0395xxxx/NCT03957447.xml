    <textblock>
      The project rolls out combined innovative low-tech thermotherapy with heat packs and WHO&#xD;
      recommended wound management in a Buruli ulcer (BU)-endemic district of West Africa. It&#xD;
      addresses three key areas of considerable clinical and public health importance in the&#xD;
      region:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to better help people managing the disabling disease BU that primarily affects children&#xD;
           in West Africa&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to implement WHO recommended general wound management for all types of wounds with tools&#xD;
           available at the peripheral level of the health care system&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to prevent systemic life threatening sequelae (e.g. sepsis and rheumatic fever) and&#xD;
           permanent local damage (e.g. motor and sensory disability) by early recognition and&#xD;
           treatment of wounds at the community level. The project translates available research&#xD;
           findings already validated on the secondary health care level into clinical practice at&#xD;
           the periphery (primary health care level). The string of the investigator's previous&#xD;
           work from the development of the BU thermotherapy-wound management-package to the proof&#xD;
           of its efficacy provides all necessary skills, tools and documents to immediately&#xD;
           proceed into practical community application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operational endpoints are&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  coverage and quality of WHO recommended wound management training of health care&#xD;
           personnel at the primary health care level (health posts);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  coverage, success rate and quality of care for patients with BU and other wounds;&#xD;
           denominator controlled at health post level and high-quality Health and Demographic&#xD;
           Surveillance Systems (HDSS) data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is embedded into a stable multidisciplinary working environment at CÃ´te d'Ivoire,&#xD;
      including an HDSS with a longstanding record of partnership and successful community-based&#xD;
      operational research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project builds on the principles laid out by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and&#xD;
      Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  targets all patients with a broken down skin barrier independent of the cause (patient&#xD;
           centred health care)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  brings diagnosis and treatment close to the community&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  educates and trains both community members and health care workers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  measures the health intervention outcome The project is fully in line with the new&#xD;
           integrated strategy for the skin NTDs of WHO's Department of Control of NTDs (WHO/NTD).&#xD;

      Overall goal of the study To contribute to a better understanding of the clinical&#xD;
      epidemiology of wounds and wound healing and to improve wound management in settings with&#xD;
      limited resources at the community level, the primary and secondary level of the health care&#xD;
      services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objectives Main study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure the proportion of wounds healed (defined as wound closed) at each cycle of&#xD;
           clinical diagnosis and the corresponding presumptive treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the clinical epidemiology of wounds presented (presumptive clinical and&#xD;
           confirmed diagnoses)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Coverage and quality of wound management training of health care personnel at the&#xD;
           peripheral health care level (health posts); Substudy 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure the effectiveness and acceptability of thermotherapy of patients with early&#xD;
           BU (&lt; 2cm) treated at health post level with the following outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Primary endpoints absence of clinically BU specific features' according to WHO&#xD;
                guidelines or 'wound closure' within 6 months after completion of heat treatment&#xD;
                (&quot;primary cure&quot;) and 'absence of BU recurrence for 12 months after completion of&#xD;
                heat treatment' (&quot;definite cure&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Secondary outcomes rates of withdrawal for low compliance consent withdrawal rating&#xD;
                of thermotherapy by health staff Substudy 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure the frequency and the severity of skin lesions (broken skin barrier) in the&#xD;
           community and the health services&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the determining factors of community and health services-based wound&#xD;
           management&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure the impact of the wound management intervention (main study and substudy 1)&#xD;
           on the frequency, spectrum and severity of wounds including systemic complications in&#xD;
           the community and at the 7 health posts / district hospital (HDSS-based) compared to the&#xD;
           baseline study before the intervention and over time after the implementation of the&#xD;
           intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target Population The target population are approximately 43,000 people of the Taabo HDSS&#xD;
      which is surveyed longitudinally for key demographic, health and socioeconomic indicators&#xD;
      since 2008. This provides ideal conditions to implement the intervention and assess the&#xD;
      impact through operational endpoints. The health centres and the district hospital involved&#xD;
      are part of the public health system. There is one district hospital and the seven health&#xD;
      posts within the Taabo DHSS.&#xD;
