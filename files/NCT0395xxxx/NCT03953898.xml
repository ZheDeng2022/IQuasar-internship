  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well olaparib works in treating patients with acute myeloid&#xD;
      leukemia that has come back (relapsed) or does not respond to treatment (refractory), or&#xD;
      myelodysplastic syndrome. Patients must also have a change in the gene called the IDH gene&#xD;
      (IDH mutation). Olaparib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes&#xD;
      needed for cell growth. This study is being done to see if olaparib is better or worse in&#xD;
      treating acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome compared to the standard&#xD;
      chemotherapy drugs.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the rate of complete response (CR) to olaparib using a composite CR endpoint&#xD;
      (CR + CR with incomplete hematologic response [CRi] + CR with partial hematologic response&#xD;
      [CRh]) in subjects with isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)1/2 mutant myelodysplastic syndrome&#xD;
      (MDS) or IDH1/2-mutant acute myeloid leukemia (AML).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) to olaparib using a composite ORR endpoint&#xD;
      (CR + morphologic leukemia-free state [MLFS] + partial response [PR]) in patients with IDH&#xD;
      mutant AML or MDS treated with olaparib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To establish the progression free survival (PFS) of patients with IDH mutant AML or MDS&#xD;
      treated with olaparib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the overall survival (OS) of patients with IDH mutant AML or MDS treated&#xD;
      with olaparib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To establish the duration of response (DOR) to treatment with olaparib. V. To evaluate&#xD;
      the safety and tolerability of olaparib in AML or MDS patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To establish a relationship between treatment response and correlative studies such as&#xD;
      plasma and bone marrow 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) levels, and IDH variant allele frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate persistence of double strand breaks in IDH 1/2 mutant AML or MDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate response to therapy in the different IDH mutant genotypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To perform molecular profiling assays on malignant and normal tissues, including, but not&#xD;
      limited to, whole exome sequencing (WES), ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing (RNAseq) order&#xD;
      to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      IVa. Identify potential predictive and prognostic biomarkers beyond any genomic alteration by&#xD;
      which treatment may be assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IVb. Identify resistance mechanisms using genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)- and RNA-based&#xD;
      assessment platforms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To contribute genetic analysis data from de-identified biospecimens to Genomic Data&#xD;
      Commons (GDC), a well annotated cancer molecular and clinical data repository, for current&#xD;
      and future research; specimens will be annotated with key clinical data, including&#xD;
      presentation, diagnosis, staging, summary treatment, and if possible, outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To bank blood and bone marrow aspirate obtained from patients at the Experimental&#xD;
      Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network (ETCTN) Biorepository at Nationwide Children's Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive olaparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28&#xD;
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for at least 90 days.&#xD;

    <description>The Mann-Whitney U test will be used to test for differences in post-treatment plasma 2HG concentrations between patients with a response to treatment and those without. Will also test for differences in Delta2HG (defined as pre-treatment minus post-treatment plasma concentration) between patients with a response to treatment and those without. Differences with p =&lt; 0.05 will be considered significant. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC) will be calculated to determine the cutoff value of the Delta2HG difference. The optimal cutoff value will be determined at the point on the ROC curve at (sensitivity + specificity - 1) is maximized.</description>

    <description>Will define MRD based on the variation of the variant allele frequency of the IDH1/2 mutation in the bone marrow of the patients before and during therapy. Will evaluate two different variables: MRD negativity (defined by the absence of detection of the IDH mutant in the sample) and the molecular response (defined by the log reduction of the frequency of the mutant allele). MRD negativity is a qualitative variable and will be reported as a percentage with 95% confidence interval for each time point and mutation. Will compare the different groups using a Chi-Square test. Molecular response is a quantitative variable reported as a median, min and max for each time point and we will use a student t test for the comparison of the different groups.</description>

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with active central nervous system (CNS) leukemia or requiring maintenance&#xD;
             intrathecal chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving concurrent chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or immunotherapy for&#xD;
             AML/MDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients actively receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Management of treatment for patients with co-occurring mutations, like FLT3, will be&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Hyperleukocytosis with &gt; 50,000 white blood cell (WBC)/mcl. Hydroxyurea for WBC count&#xD;
             control is permitted before starting treatment and may be continued until day 28 of&#xD;
             cycle 1. The maximum dose of hydrea will be 6 grams per day. Patients will be&#xD;
             withdrawn from the study if &gt; 50,000 WBC/mcl occur or recur &gt; 14 days after starting&#xD;
             treatment on the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active, uncontrolled infection. Patients with infection controlled with antibiotics&#xD;

             months) myocardial infarction, uncontrolled major seizure disorder, unstable spinal&#xD;
             cord compression, superior vena cava syndrome, extensive interstitial bilateral lung&#xD;
             disease on high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan or any psychiatric disorder&#xD;
             that prohibits obtaining informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are pregnant or nursing. Pregnant women are excluded from this study&#xD;
             because olaparib is a PARP inhibitor with the potential for teratogenic or&#xD;
             abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for AEs in&#xD;
             nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with olaparib, breastfeeding&#xD;
             should be discontinued if the mother is treated with olaparib. These potential risks&#xD;
             may also apply to other agents used in this study.&#xD;

             brain metastases is not required. Patients with spinal cord compression unless&#xD;
             considered to have received definitive treatment for this and evidence of clinically&#xD;
             stable disease for 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient can receive a stable dose of corticosteroids, up to 20 mg by mouth (PO)&#xD;
             prednisone daily, before and during the study as long as these were started at least 4&#xD;
             weeks prior to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients unable to swallow orally administered medication and patients with&#xD;
             gastrointestinal disorders likely to interfere with absorption of the study&#xD;
             medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any previous treatment with PARP inhibitor, including olaparib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant use of known strong (e.g., phenobarbital, enzalutamide, phenytoin,&#xD;
             rifampicin, rifabutin, rifapentine, carbamazepine, nevirapine and St John's wort) or&#xD;
             moderate CYP3A inducers (e.g., bosentan, efavirenz, modafinil). The required washout&#xD;
             period prior to starting olaparib is 5 weeks for enzalutamide or phenobarbital and 3&#xD;
             weeks for other agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major surgery within 2 weeks of starting study treatment and patients must have&#xD;
