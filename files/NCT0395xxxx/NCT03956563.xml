  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to clinically confirm, by comparison with a control&#xD;
      group, the performance of the 10600 +1540 nm laser in the improvement of atrophic vaginal&#xD;
      epithelium at 3 months after the last laser treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Confirm the performance of 10600 +1540 nm laser in the improvement of atrophic vaginal&#xD;
           epithelium at 9 months post-laser treatment, and compare it with the results at 3&#xD;
           months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the improvement of the GSM urinary symptoms and urinary incontinence (UI) and&#xD;
           their impact on the Quality of Life, at each timepoint after the first laser treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the Patient's Global Impression of Improvement (PGI) with the laser treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  For the GSM symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  For the urinary symptoms and UI&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To assess the patient's satisfaction with the laser treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  For the GSM symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  For the urinary symptoms and UI.&#xD;

    <description>The primary efficacy outcome measure in this study is to obtain on the atrophic vaginal epithelium at 3 months after the last laser treatment, values going from absent/low estrogenization (0-49%) to moderate or high estrogenization (50-64%) measured with VMV. The results will be compared between the treatment and the control arm.</description>
