  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the link between neurobehavioral measures of the&#xD;
      mesolimbic reward system and immune functioning in healthy individuals, via fMRI&#xD;
      neurofeedback modulation of mesolimbic reward system, and the consecutive assesment of immune&#xD;
      response to Hepatitis B vaccination.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For many years, the link between mental processes and physical health has remained obscure.&#xD;
      Yet, over time, studies have begun to shed light on the intimate relationship between one's&#xD;
      physical condition and mental state. One body of research aimed at elucidating the mind-body&#xD;
      relationship is the study of the placebo effect. Placebo effects result mainly from conscious&#xD;
      expectations to become healthy in therapeutic settings, and from unconscious conditioned&#xD;
      responses to therapeutical settings that predict beneficial outcomes. Both processes are&#xD;
      asociated with the neuronal reward system, which mediates reward processing, reward valuation&#xD;
      and value based-learning. However, it remains unclear how do these processes mediated by the&#xD;
      reward system promote therapeutic effects?&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent study established a causal relationship between mesolimbic activation (VTA) and a&#xD;
      measurable immunological response in mice. Stimulation of the VTA increased anti-bacterial&#xD;
      immune functioning, an effect that was mediated by sympathetic nervous system, which is&#xD;
      regulated by the brain and innervates all immune organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In light of these findings, the current study aims to assess the relationship between&#xD;
      reward-related brain activation and immune functions in humans. fMRI Neurofeedback, a task&#xD;
      that allows individuals to self modulate specified neural patterns in real-time, will be used&#xD;
      to induce mesolimbic activation, following which healthy individuals will vaccinate against&#xD;
      Hepatitis B. Immunological effects will be assessed by comparing immunological measures with&#xD;
      respect to Hepatitis B prior and following mesolimbic activation and Hepatitis B vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term goal of this study is to demonstrate a causal link between reward activation&#xD;
      and an objective measurable physiological response of great significance, and to develop the&#xD;
      means for individuals to exploit such mechanism for boosting immune functioning. i.e. to&#xD;
      harness endogenous reward-related brain activation to strengthen the immune system, for&#xD;
      clinical pathologies such as autoimmune diseases, maleble pathogens, cancer, etc.&#xD;

    <measure>Immunological: change in anti HBs immunoglobins in plasma</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To measure antibody titers in plasma, blood samples will be taken at four time points: before neurofeedback training (-14d); before Hepatitis B vaccination (day 0), 14 days and 28 days after vaccination. Anti-HBs change will be defined as average levels post-vaccination (14 and 28 days) minus average levels pre-vaccination (-14 and 0 days).&#xD;
The investigators predict that:&#xD;
i.Simple group effect: experimental arm subjects (mesolimbic fMRI NF) will exhibit higher levels of anti-HBs change than both the active comparator group (control fMRI-NF) and the no-treatment group.&#xD;
ii.Mesolimbic activation-Immunologic response correlation: mesolimbic activity during the neurofeedback task (across all NF participants) during the last session will predict anti-HBs levels following vaccination.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Immunological: change in cytokines blood concentrations following vaccination</measure>
    <time_frame>17 days</time_frame>
    <description>To assess cytokine levels in plasma (IL-4, IL-6, TNFalpha, IFNgamma), the investigators will use the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in plasma taken before vaccination (day -14 and day 0) and three days following vaccination. As mere NF practice may affect cytokines levels, change in cytokines will be analyzed via repeated measures linear model, comprising three time points - before NF training (-14d), before vaccination (day 0) and 3 days following vaccination. groupXtime (3X3) main effect and interactions will be inspected.&#xD;
The investigators predict that:&#xD;
i.Experimental arm group will exhibit higher levels of cytokines concentration that the active control group and natural history group.&#xD;
ii.Mesolimbic activation-Immunologic response correlation: mesolimbic activity during the neurofeedback task (across all NF participants) during the last session will predict changes in cytokines blood concentrations.</description>

    <time_frame>1-3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>ROIs of Mesolimbic reward network (or control networks) will be defined as mentioned in arms description. CSF voxels will be excluded from all ROIs. Outcome will be measured for each experimental group/control sub-group, as the contrast between regulation and watch conditions, for each NF run, each session (3*4=12 runs).&#xD;
To assess differences in meoslimbic reward network activation between experimental and active control groups, a 12 by 2 (runXgroup) model will be constructed.&#xD;
The investigators predict that:&#xD;
i. Simple group effects during last (fourth) NF session: experimental arm subjects (mesolimbic fMRI NF) will exhibit higher meoslimbic reward network activity than the active comparator group.&#xD;
ii. Simple experimental arm group learning effects: a significant effect of run (time) for the experimental arm mesolimbic reward network acitivity.</description>

The investigators predict that:&#xD;
i. subjects with approach tendencies will exhibit stronger mesolimbic reward network activations during the MID task and NF task, compared to avoiders.&#xD;
ii. Approachers will exhibit higher immunological changes as reflected by the main immunological outcome measures, compared to avoiders.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional connectivity of mesolimbic network during rest fMRI scan</measure>
    <time_frame>1-3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Rest scans will be applied at the beginning of the first and at the end of the fourth (last) NF practice session, in order to assess functional changes in the mesolimbic reward circuit following NF training.&#xD;
The investigators intend to explore whether changes in functional connectivity of the mesolimbic reward network will occur specifically in the mesolimbic fMRI-NF group (compared with control fMRI NF group).</description>

    <measure>Subjective reports of SHAPS (Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A 14 items (answered on a four points scale ranging from 'strongly disagree' to 'strongly agree') questionnaire for estimation of the degree of which a person is able to experience pleasure or the anticipation of a pleasurable experience. The questionnaire is scored as the sum of of the items (totals scores ranged from 0 to 14). A higher total score indicates higher levels of anhedonia.&#xD;
Exploratory Analyses: The investigators will examine whether the questionnaire scores prior to NF practice and vaccination, will account for differences in NF learning and in immunological outcome measures. Moreover, the investigators will track changes in this score along the experiment in order to inspect the relationship between subjective hedonic experience and NF success/immune functioning.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective reports to Sensitivity to Punishment and Sensitivity to Reward Questionnaire (SPSRQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A questionnaire for assessing responsiveness to reward and punishment. The questionnaire includes 48 yes/no questions divided into two scales - sensitivity to punishment (SP) and sensitivity to reward (SR). Each sub-scale score is derived by summation of the reports.&#xD;
Exploratory analysis: the investigators will examine whether the questionnaire score during the first session (prior to NF practice and vaccination), will account for differences in NF learning and in immunological outcome measures.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) measure: Galvanic Skin Response (GSR)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days - 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measurements of GSR are taken during fMRI scans in all NF practices, in order to monitor the activity of the sympathetic system. For each fMRI scan, GSR measures such as nSCR and magnitude of skin conductance will be calculated.&#xD;
Exploratory analyses: the investigators suspect the sympathetic system will mediate the correlation between the mesolimbic reward activations and immunological outcome meaures (see primary outcome measures 1 and 2). Therefore, the investigators will explore the link between sympathetic measures taken at TP4 (prior to vaccination) and the correlation between reward mesolimbic activations during TP4 NF practice and the immunological outcome measures described above.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) measure: Heart Rate Variability (HRV)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days - 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measurements of HRV are taken during fMRI scans in all NF practices, in order to monitor the activity of the sympathetic system. For each fMRI scan, HRV measures such as average variability and frequency ratios will be calculated.&#xD;
Exploratory analyses: the investigators suspect the sympathetic system will mediate the correlation between the mesolimbic reward activations and immunological outcome meaures (see primary outcome measures 1 and 2). Therefore, the investigators will explore the link between sympathetic measures taken at TP4 (prior to vaccination) and the correlation between reward mesolimbic activations during TP4 NF practice and the immunological outcome measures described above.</description>
