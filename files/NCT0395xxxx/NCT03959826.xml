  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) are unemployed, with estimates indicating rates as&#xD;
      high as 60%. This study will examine the efficacy of reinforcing job-acquisition activities&#xD;
      for improving employment outcomes in PLWHA who desire to return to the workforce in part- or&#xD;
      full-time capacity. In total, this study will randomly assign 144 unemployed PLWHA to one of&#xD;
      two interventions. All participants will receive usual unemployment services with an emphasis&#xD;
      on specific issues related to HIV/AIDS, plus encouragement for completing activities geared&#xD;
      toward employment readiness and acquisition. The enhanced intervention will involve that same&#xD;
      treatment plus chances to win prizes for engaging in job-related activities each week.&#xD;
      Participants will receive study treatments for 16 weeks and complete follow-up evaluations&#xD;
      throughout 18 months. The hypothesis is that participants reinforced for completing&#xD;
      job-related activities will transition to employment at higher and faster rates and work more&#xD;
      often than those who are not reinforced for job-related activities.&#xD;

      Many persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) are unemployed, with estimates indicating rates as&#xD;
      high as 60%. This study will examine the efficacy of reinforcing job-acquisition activities&#xD;
      for improving employment outcomes in PLWHA who desire to return to the workforce in part- or&#xD;
      full-time capacity. In total, this study will randomly assign 144 unemployed PLWHA to one of&#xD;

      toward employment readiness and acquisition. The enhanced intervention will involve that same&#xD;
      treatment plus chances to win prizes for engaging in job-related activities each week.&#xD;
      Participants will receive study treatments for 16 weeks and complete follow-up evaluations&#xD;
      throughout 18 months. Structured evaluations will assess employment outcomes, quality of life&#xD;
      indices, physical and cognitive functioning, psychological symptoms, viral loads, and drug&#xD;
      use and risk behaviors. The hypothesis is that participants reinforced for completing&#xD;
      job-related activities will transition to employment at higher and faster rates and work more&#xD;
      often than those who are not reinforced for job-related activities. The investigators also&#xD;
      expect the reinforcement intervention will increase quality of life, reduce depressive&#xD;
      symptoms, and improve medical outcomes. Compared to the standard care condition, it may also&#xD;
      maintain or improve cognitive functioning and medication adherence and reduce risk behaviors&#xD;
      that spread infectious diseases. The investigators will evaluate moderators and mediators of&#xD;
      key employment and health outcomes, with an emphasis on exploring the extent to which work&#xD;
      conditions (temporary, under the table, physically or emotionally demanding jobs etc.) impact&#xD;
      psychosocial and physical health.&#xD;
