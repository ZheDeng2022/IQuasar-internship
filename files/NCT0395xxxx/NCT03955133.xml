  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polypharmacy, the use of multiple or inappropriate medications, has the potential to harm&#xD;
      older adults by causing cognitive impairment, falls, and hospitalisations. The nurse-led&#xD;
      intervention (The ADRe Profile) to review mental health medicines has demonstrated improved&#xD;
      care quality by: identifying serious adverse drug reactions (ADRs); reducing prescription of&#xD;
      mental health medicines; reducing the prevalence of pain and nausea; and, increasing&#xD;
      non-urgent national health service (NHS) contacts. The investigators will develop ADRe to&#xD;
      encompass medicines commonly prescribed in primary care and evaluate intervention&#xD;
      implementation in care homes in Aneurin Bevan University Health Board.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will introduce medicines' monitoring using the PADRe Profile into up to 7&#xD;
      care homes, each with up to 26 residents prescribed &gt;4 medicines (estimated ~90% residents).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each home will identify a nurse lead and a deputy. Nurses will be asked to administer the&#xD;
      PADRe Profile with all patients prescribed &gt;4 medicines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Barriers, facilitators, and feasibility of the Profile will be explored. This will identify&#xD;
      how, in which contexts medicines' monitoring can be integrated into routine care, relate the&#xD;
      Profile to improved processes and outcomes of care, and inform implementation strategies (see&#xD;
      logic model in cited papers).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record review before and after each of 3 administrations of the intervention to identify&#xD;
           clinical and prescription changes. Narrative accounts of problems causing moderate or&#xD;
           severe harm will be prepared.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serial interviews and debriefs with nurses: three per nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stakeholder interviews with patients, participating pharmacists and prescribers for an&#xD;
           overview of implementation.&#xD;
