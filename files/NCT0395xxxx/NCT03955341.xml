&#xD;
      In management of patients with deep carious lesions in permanent posterior teeth, will the&#xD;
      use of Diode laser with an output power of 0.5 watt or chemical disinfection using 2%&#xD;
      Chlorhexidine affect the pulp vitality compared to conventional selective caries removal&#xD;
      without disinfection?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient/Problem Patients with deep carious lesions in permanent posterior teeth&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention 1-Diode laser disinfection and 2- Chemical disinfection using 2% Chlorhexidine&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparator Selective conventional caries removal without disinfection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Pulp vitality&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting(Where will the study be performed) Dental Clinics Complex, Misr International&#xD;
      University, and Research Unit Microbiology Lab Time (follow-up periods) 3 months and 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Aim of the Study, Research Objectives and Clinical Relevance Aim: the aim of this study is&#xD;
      to evaluate the clinical outcome (in terms of maintaining pulp vitality, assessed by cold&#xD;
      pulp testing, absence of spontaneous pain, sensitivity to percussion, inspection for sinus or&#xD;
      fistula or swelling, and radiographically using cone beam computed tomography) and the&#xD;
      antimicrobial effect of Diode laser and chemical disinfection in comparison to conventional&#xD;
      selective caries removal without disinfection in management of deep carious lesions in&#xD;
      permanent posterior teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research null hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There's no difference between the effect of Diode laser or chemical disinfection in&#xD;
      maintaining pulp vitality compared to selective caries removal in management of deep carious&#xD;
      lesions in permanent teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objectives of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. To compare the effect of diode laser versus conventional selective caries removal&#xD;
                in maintaining pulp vitality expressed as a binary variable (success/failure), and&#xD;
                assessed by cold pulp testing, absence of spontaneous pain, sensitivity to&#xD;
                percussion, inspection for sinus or fistula or swelling.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. To compare the effect of chemical disinfection versus conventional selective caries&#xD;
                removal in maintaining pulp vitality expressed as a binary variable&#xD;
                (success/failure), and assessed by cold pulp testing, absence of spontaneous pain,&#xD;
                sensitivity to percussion, inspection for sinus or fistula or swelling.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. To evaluate dentin thickness and density as measured by cone beam computed&#xD;
                tomography (CBCT) using Hounsfield unit, after placement of the restorative&#xD;
                material and at 6 months follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. To evaluate microbiological count in all study groups as measured by colony counter&#xD;
                using colony-forming unit as the measuring unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. • Clinical relevance: Diode laser could yield to better clinical outcomes in&#xD;
                management of deep carious lesions, minimizing the need for root canal treatment.&#xD;
                This would decrease the number of treatment visits, saving time, effort, and money&#xD;
                for both the patient and the dentist.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Also, this leads to price reduction by decreasing the number of procedures and&#xD;
                visits needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
                VI. Study Design Pilot clinical study&#xD;
&#xD;
                VII. Materials/ Participants (Subjects) and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study setting: Study is to be conducted in Dental Clinics Complex (MIU Dental Laser&#xD;
           Center) in Misr International University, Egypt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are to be selected from the outpatient dental clinics complex, Misr International&#xD;
      University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The microbiological testing will be performed at the Bacteriology lab, Research unit, MIU&#xD;
      Sample type:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purposive sample&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method of randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Computer generated randomization for sequence will be held at the 1st visit. Randomization&#xD;
      will be performed through computed software (www.randomizer.org).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number corresponding to each treatment procedure will be recorded on cards kept inside&#xD;
      sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Sample size calculation: Due to lack of sufficient literature and this is the first study&#xD;
      to our knowledge evaluating the primary outcome (pulp vitality), after using diode laser&#xD;
      disinfection. Thus, this pilot study will be carried out on 30 patients. So, each group will&#xD;
      include 10 patients. Sample size power will be calculated based on the results of this pilot&#xD;
      study using G*Power Version 3.1.9.2 to continue full sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinical, microbiological and radiographic data will be collected, tabulated and&#xD;
           statistically analyzed to compare between the success rates of diode laser, chemical&#xD;
           disinfection, and selective caries removal, using IBM SPSS advanced statistics&#xD;
           (Statistical Package for Social Sciences), version 21 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).&#xD;
           Numerical data will be described as mean and standard deviation, while qualitative data&#xD;
           will be described as number and percentage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Comparisons between the study groups will be performed using suitable parametric and&#xD;
           non-parametric tests of significance depending on the distribution of the collected&#xD;
           data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Intervention (methods, blinding)&#xD;
&#xD;
      I-) Operative procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedures involve performing conservative caries management for one tooth per patient,&#xD;
      using either Diode laser or 2% Chlorhexidine (chemical disinfectant) or no disinfection&#xD;
      (24,32). Patients will be randomly allocated into one of the three study groups using&#xD;
      computed software (www.randomization.com); group 1: Diode laser disinfection with an output&#xD;
      power of 0.5 watt, group 2: Chemical disinfection using 2% Chlorhexidine, and group 3:&#xD;
      conventional selective caries removal without disinfection (control group). The same final&#xD;
      restorative materials will be used in all groups, so that the outcome would only reflect the&#xD;
      effect of the technique of disinfection versus no disinfection. Each patient will be assessed&#xD;
      for eligibility, the procedures will be explained to him/her and if they agree to&#xD;
      participate, they sign the informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The principal investigator will perform the procedures for all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preoperative clinical assessment and periapical radiographs will be performed before&#xD;
           starting the procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Local anesthesia will be administered and the tooth will be isolated with a rubber dam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Access to the lesion will be gained with a sterile high-speed bur or diamond burs, to&#xD;
           establish the outline form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Caries will be completely removed from the surrounding cavity walls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Superficial necrotic carious fragments will be removed from the floor using a sharp&#xD;
           sterile excavator, while soft dentin will be left on the floor to avoid pulpal exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I-Dentinal sample collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Samples will be collected from each patient from the base of the infected cavity using&#xD;
      sterile using sterile spoon excavator. Sample will be transferred to sterile Eppendorf tubes&#xD;
      containing 0.5 ml of phosphate buffer saline solution with aseptic precautions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1) (Intervention Diode laser disinfection with an output power of 0.5 watt group):&#xD;
&#xD;
      After collecting the first sample of dentin as described above, the cavity will be&#xD;
      disinfected using Diode laser (EPIC™, BIOLASE) with 940 nm and an output power of 0.5 watt&#xD;
      (24). A 400 µm noninitiated tip will be used for cavity irradiation, in a noncontact mode&#xD;
      (2mm distance), 5 sec/mm2 in sweeping motion. A 2nd dentinal sample will be collected after&#xD;
      diode laser disinfection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2) (Intervention chemical disinfection group):&#xD;
&#xD;
      After collecting the first sample of dentin, the cavity will be disinfected using 2%&#xD;
      Chlorhexidine (Consepsis®, Ultradent) for 20 seconds (32). Then a 2nd dentinal sample will be&#xD;
      collected after chemical disinfection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3) Comparator (Control group):&#xD;
&#xD;
      After collecting the first sample of dentin, the cavity will be restored.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For all groups, the cavity will be filled with glass ionomer material as a base material&#xD;
           and then will be restored with resin composite restoration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will receive postoperative instructions and oral hygiene guidelines that should&#xD;
           be followed during the follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be recalled for follow up visit after three and six months to follow-up&#xD;
           the pulp vitality and restoration condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Outcome assessment will be performed by the outcome investigators according to the&#xD;
           evaluation chart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II) Observations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinical Evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Follow-up with clinical assessments will be performed after 3 and 6 months (T3 and&#xD;
           T6).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Upon completing the intervention, the patient will be recalled after 3 and 6 months to&#xD;
           assess outcome. To assess the primary outcome (pulp vitality), previous studies have&#xD;
           used a binary variable (success/failure) indicating whether the restored tooth&#xD;
           maintained its vitality at the outcome investigation time(28). Success required positive&#xD;
           results in all four tests mentioned below. In our study clinical success will be&#xD;
           assessed using binary variables in addition to visual analogue scale by:&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1. Cold pulp testing: An ice-rod will be used for this test. Results should be&#xD;
           positive or negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2. Absence of spontaneous pain: Post-operative pain will be assessed using the visual&#xD;
           Analogue Scale Score (VAS), which is a measurement method for subjective characteristics&#xD;
           of pain. Respondents specify their level of agreement to a statement by indicating a&#xD;
           position along a 10 cm line between two end-points, with the term &quot;no sensitivity&quot; at&#xD;
           one end and &quot;intolerable sensitivity&quot; at the other end. A score from (0 to 10 is given).&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.3. Sensitivity to percussion: (positive/negative). 1.4. Inspection for&#xD;
           Sinus/fistula/swelling: using visual inspection (positive/negative).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBT): CBT will be used to indicate the presence or&#xD;
           absence of periapical radiolucencies (positive/negative), as well as evaluating the&#xD;
           thickness and relative density of the remaining dentin below the final restoration.&#xD;
           Using the smallest field of view available (5 cm x 5 cm).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Preoperative clinical assessment and radiographs will be performed before&#xD;
                intervention and then the patients will receive their treatment and final&#xD;
                restorations (T0).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cone beam computed tomography will be performed at T0 and T6.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Microbiological Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collected dentinal samples will be cultured on two types of selective media; Mitis&#xD;
      salivurias agar will be used as a selective medium for Streptococcus mutans and Rogosa agar&#xD;
      medium for Lactobacilli(1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total Viable Count Determination:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Preparation of serial dilutions: Six of tenfold serial dilution (from 10-1 to 10-6 )&#xD;
           will be prepared as working solutions as follows: i. 900 µl of sterile PBS or sterile&#xD;
           Saline + 100 µl of the collected sample to prepare 10-1 dilution (D1) ii. After mixing&#xD;
           the content of the D1, transfer 100 µl to the second tube containing 900 µl of sterile&#xD;
           PBS or sterile Saline to prepare 10-2 dilution (D2).&#xD;
&#xD;
           iii. Continue like this until preparing 10-6 dilution (D6). Tube Dilution Factor&#xD;
           Dilution 1 10-1 1/10 2 10-2 1/100 3 10-3 1/1,000 4 10-4 1/10,000 5 10-5 1/100,000 6 10-6&#xD;
           1/1,000,000&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Disperse 100 µl of diluted microbial solution on the surface of the plate for each&#xD;
           selective media mentioned previously.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. All the Rogosa agar plates will be cultured under anaerobic conditions (anaerobic gas&#xD;
           mixture, 80% N2, 10% CO2, 10% H2) while Mitis salivurias agar plates will be cultured&#xD;
           under aerobic conditions. Both media will be incubated at 37 °C from 24 to 48 hrs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Counting bacterial colonies: Select plates that appear to have between 30 - 300 colonies&#xD;
           in and on the agar as this gives the best statistical representation of the number of&#xD;
           bacteria. The total number of the viable bacteria equals the number of counted colonies&#xD;
           divided by the dilution, for example: number of colonies÷ 1/1000 (10-3) = number of&#xD;
           colonies× 1000 • Blinding: Single blinded as Outcome assessors will be blinded. Both,&#xD;
           the participants and principal investigator cannot be blinded owing to the use of two&#xD;
           obviously different methods, laser and chemical disinfection, or no disinfection.&#xD;

          6. Teeth with cervical caries.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Teeth showing signs of periodontitis following AAP 2017 criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Justification of Exclusions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient-related:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Medically compromised patients, as they will not be able to attend multiple&#xD;
             appointments or may require special management.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Pregnant women; as radiographs cannot be taken for them.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Allergy to any of the restorative materials, including anesthetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Uncooperative patients will not abide by the instructions or attend the appointments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Tooth-related:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Deciduous teeth; as the study is targeting only permanent teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Teeth with previous restorations, which may add another variable to the study (type of&#xD;
             old restorative material, extent of recurrent caries).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Spontaneous pain or prolonged pain after sensitivity tests (cold and electrical&#xD;
             tests), which would indicate irreversible pulpal damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Negative sensitivity tests, periapical radiolucencies and sensitivity to axial or&#xD;
             lateral percussion, which would indicate pulp necrosis before signing the consent&#xD;
             form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Teeth presenting external or internal resorption, with adverse pulpal reactions, which&#xD;
             may affect the outcome of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Teeth with cervical caries; which can't be evaluated on periapical radiographs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Teeth showing signs of periodontitis following AAP 2017 criteria, which may affect the&#xD;
             outcome of the study.&#xD;
