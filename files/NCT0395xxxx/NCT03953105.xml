    <textblock>
      Comparison of two different pediatric emergency rulers for length-based body weight&#xD;
      estimation in pediatric emergencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome is the time needed to identify four defined parameters from the pediatric&#xD;
      emergency rulers during a low-fidelity pediatric emergency scenario (cardiac arrest).&#xD;
      Secondary outcome is the correctness of the identified parameters and the percentage&#xD;
      deviation from the correct value.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Medical team members (Paramedics, EMT) of Schutz und Rettung Zurich, Zurich Switzerland were&#xD;
      asked to participate in this study. If they were not familiar with one of the three devices&#xD;
      written informed consent was obtained and the participant included in this study. This&#xD;
      exclusion criteria was necessary to prevent a bias by already knowing where to find the&#xD;
      information of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pediatric emergency rulers investigated were the electronic Pediatric Emergency Ruler&#xD;
      (ePER) and the Broselow Tape (BT)&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants were instructed for the use of the two pediatric emergency rulers and were&#xD;
      given time to practice with each device using one training manikin (Sim-Baby)&#xD;
&#xD;
      After they felt comfortable using the devices the participants were randomly assigned to use&#xD;
      each device only once with one of two different manikins:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resusci Baby, Laerdal/Dräger Medical Switzerland AG, Liebefeld, Switzerland Ambu® Junior,&#xD;
      Ambu® GmbH, Bad Nauheim, Germany&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each manikin was only used once for the same participant. This guaranteed that the&#xD;
      participants were blinded for the manikins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The low-fidelity pediatric emergency scenario simulated was a cardiac arrest and the&#xD;
      participants were asked to identify the following information from the pediatric emergency&#xD;
      rulers:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimated body weight Joule suggested for defibrillation Recommended epinephrine dose&#xD;
      Suggested endotracheal tube size&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants stood aside from the manikin with a pediatric emergency ruler in their hand.&#xD;
      After they stated they were ready, the facilitator started a countdown from three and gave&#xD;
      the command to start. This setting was identical for all two pediatric emergency rulers and&#xD;
      all two manikins. The time until each parameter was identified and the value of the parameter&#xD;
      were recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome was the time needed to identify the four above defined parameters. Secondary&#xD;
      outcome was the correctness of the identified parameters and the percentage deviation from&#xD;
      the correct value.&#xD;
