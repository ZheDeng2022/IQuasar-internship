  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain is defined by IASP (International Association for the Study of Pain) as &quot;an unpleasant&#xD;
      sensory and emotional experience associated with the damage actual or potential tissue or&#xD;
      described in terms that suggest such harm&quot;. Episodes of pain and discomfort experienced by&#xD;
      children are one of the main factors for fear and anxiety in dentistry, especially those that&#xD;
      present the condition of Molar-Incisive Hipomineralization, where we observed increased&#xD;
      levels of anxiety in relation to the treatment. In order to improve the painful sensation&#xD;
      that patients with Molar-Incisor Hipomineralization present as well as anxiety demonstrated&#xD;
      by these patients in face of dental treatment, the objective of present study will be to&#xD;
      evaluate the occurrence and degree of pain after procedures dentists with administration of&#xD;
      pre-emptive analgesia or placebo, in children with Molar-Incisive Hipomineralization. Fifty&#xD;
      patients will be selected in the Pediatric Dentistry courses of the FORP-USP undergraduate&#xD;
      course, aged 6 to 12 years, of both sexes, who present at least 2 (two) upper and / or lower&#xD;
      molars affected by Molar- Incisors that need some kind of restorative treatment, extraction&#xD;
      or endodontic treatment. Also, these patients should present enamel and dentin fractures&#xD;
      caused by MIH, atypical restoration and / or atypical caries, and that present pain above the&#xD;
      moderate degree (6&gt;), after stimulation with air/water jet for 5 seconds.&#xD;
