      STUDY SUMMARY Incisional hernias, or swellings of the abdominal scar after surgery, remain&#xD;
      problematic especially after transplant surgery. This is because they can cause&#xD;
      complications, including trapping of bowel or the transplant. This can cause life threatening&#xD;
      emergencies but is at the very least unsightly and uncomfortable for the patient. Transplant&#xD;
      patients are especially likely to develop hernias because of the diseases causing the renal&#xD;
      failure and the drugs that they take to dampen the immune system. There is evidence from&#xD;
      other surgery that the stitching methods that are used to close the wounds might decrease the&#xD;
      risk of surgical hernias. This is achieved by placing smaller and more numerous sutures&#xD;
      (stitches) in the wound to increase the strength of the repair. However, this has never been&#xD;
      tested formally in transplant where it may provide significant benefit. We intend to do some&#xD;
      initial investigation of whether using the smaller stitches may provide benefit over more&#xD;
      traditional methods that are currently being used. We will look at early complications after&#xD;
      surgery but also the rate of hernia formation later. We hope to improve outcomes and reduce&#xD;
      complications for our transplant patients by doing this. In addition we will collect blood&#xD;
      and tissue samples from both live kidney donors and the recipients to microscopically analyse&#xD;
      their collagen to identify potential factors which may indicate risk of hernia formation.&#xD;

      Study Design This study has two phases. In phase 1 we will perform a retrospective review of&#xD;
      hernia incidence in our centre over the last decade. We will seek to identify risk factors in&#xD;
      our transplant cohort. In phase 2 we will perform a prospective randomised blinded&#xD;
      feasibility trial in which the conventional large bites technique will be compared with the&#xD;
      small bites technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY SETTING The study will be carried out on one site at Manchester Royal Infirmary, part&#xD;
      of Manchester University National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust. This is a regional&#xD;
      Renal and Pancreas Transplant centre performing approximately 60 pancreas transplants per&#xD;
      annum and 350 kidney transplants. All members of the team have academic track records and&#xD;
      participate in several on-going research projects. Current research projects are&#xD;
      investigating cardiovascular disease, kidney perfusion, Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging to&#xD;
      name a few.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH QUESTIONS, AIMS, AND OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 To retrospectively evaluate the incidence of incisional hernias in our transplant&#xD;
      population and associated risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To perform prospective randomized double blinded feasibility trial to investigate the&#xD;
           use of &quot;small bites&quot; (SB) vs &quot;large bites (LB)&quot; for closure of abdominal incisions&#xD;
           following kidney transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To collect detailed medical histories from all patients included in the study to look&#xD;
           for potential medical risk factors which may predispose to hernia formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To collect tissue and blood samples to investigate potential biological and histological&#xD;
           markers of hernia formation, from both patients with end stage renal failure receiving a&#xD;
           living-donor kidney transplant, and samples from the donor nephrectomy patients for&#xD;
           histological comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To assess quality of life and pain scores in the early and delayed post-operative phase&#xD;
           (week 1, 6 months and 1 year)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes Phase 1 Incidence of Incisional Hernia within 1 and 3 years post-transplant&#xD;
      clinically or radiologically detected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 Primary outcome Incidence of Incisional Hernia within one year post transplant,&#xD;
      either clinically or radiologically detected. Any incisional hernia identified will be&#xD;
      classified as per European Hernia Society Guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes Incidence of post-operative complications at 6 months post op (burst&#xD;
      abdomen, chest infection, surgical site infection returns to theatre,etc), pain score, costs,&#xD;
      length of hospital stay, quality of life at week 1, 6 and 12 months post-transplant, collagen&#xD;
      and serum biomarkers which may predispose to hernia formation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling and recruitment Sample identification Phase 1 Data will be collected from the&#xD;
      medical records of our Transplant population and entered into an excel spreadsheet no&#xD;
      personal identifiers will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 The Chief Investigator (CI) and Principle Investigator (PI) will identify patients on&#xD;
      the transplant waiting list and send copies of the information sheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following ethical approval, patients undergoing first or second renal transplantation will be&#xD;
      asked for informed consent to participate in the study to receive either small or large&#xD;
      bites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CI and PI are part of the direct care team. The CI will have custody of the clinical&#xD;
      information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical details will be recorded on hospital pass worded computers. Blood samples will be&#xD;
      anonymised at the time of collection. Patients will be given a study code and blood samples&#xD;
      will be labelled with this code to ensure anonymity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The custodian of the data and samples will be the CI.Mr David van Dellen.&#xD;
