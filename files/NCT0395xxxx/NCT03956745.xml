  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study investigators want to learn more about the underlying biological clock and to see if&#xD;
      the timing of that clock can be estimated from a single blood sample.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is an urgent need for a practical way to assess circadian timing accurately in both&#xD;
      general and sleep medicine. The study is designed to assess the levels of different&#xD;
      biomarkers in the blood taken from frequent samples across three separate sleep-wake&#xD;
      conditions - Conventional/Normal sleep-wake conditions (baseline), extended wake/acute sleep&#xD;
      deprivation (constant routine), and during irregular sleep-wake conditions (inverted day).&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to complete medical, psychological, and sleep-wake evaluations&#xD;
      prior to the study. Upon completion of screening, if eligible, participants will stay 7&#xD;
      consecutive days and nights in the sleep research laboratory within the hospital.&#xD;

      A genetic blood sample will be collected from each participant. Candidate circadian or sleep&#xD;
      genes will be directly sequenced in order to identify polymorphisms or mutations that&#xD;
      associate with circadian or sleep phenotypes. Researchers may also conduct genome wide&#xD;
      analysis on the DNA sample.&#xD;
