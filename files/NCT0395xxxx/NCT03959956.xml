      This study aims to evaluate an automated interpretation algorithm of recorded lung sound by a&#xD;
      digital stethoscope, name the Smartscope, among rural Bangladeshi children receiving&#xD;
      community care in order to improve the diagnosis of childhood pneumonia at first level&#xD;
      facility in low- and middle-income countries. A mixed-methods study will be conducted for a&#xD;
      period of twelve months in rural Sylhet, Bangladesh. A total of 12 community health workers&#xD;
      (CHWs) and 12 community healthcare providers (CHCPs) will be recruited and trained for this&#xD;
      study. CHWs will conduct household surveillance to identify children with cough and difficult&#xD;
      breathing and refer to nearby community clinic (CC). The CHCPs will screen the children at&#xD;
      the CCs as per protocol and enroll the suspected cases with couth or difficult breathing. A&#xD;
      total of 1003 children will be enrolled in this study. Enrolled children will be assessed for&#xD;
      signs and symptoms of pneumonia including oxygen saturation. The children will have their&#xD;
      lung sounds recorded by the Smartscope at four sequential locations. A listening panel&#xD;
      comprises by pediatricians will generate one summary patient classification of normal,&#xD;
      crackle, wheeze, crackle and wheeze, or uninterpretable. The Respiratory detector automated&#xD;
      algorithm will be applied to the lung recording to generate an interpretation. The study&#xD;
      hypothesis is more than 50% of patients will have quality lung sound recordings and the&#xD;
      agreement between the automated computerized analysis by Respiratory Detector and an expert&#xD;
      listening panel will be high (kappa &gt;0.5).&#xD;

      Background Childhood pneumonia is the second leading cause of under-five death accounting for&#xD;
      about 0.921 million children globally.1 About 120 million new episodes of childhood pneumonia&#xD;
      occur each year worldwide.2 The estimated incidence is 0.015 episodes per child-year in&#xD;
      developed and 0.22 episodes per child-year in developing countries in this age group.3 In&#xD;
      Bangladesh, the annual incidence of pneumonia is 36 per 100 child-years.4 Expanding pneumonia&#xD;
      treatment beyond higher level facility and into first level facility settings with lay&#xD;
      community health workers (CHWs) is an emerging strategy that can address gaps in care access.&#xD;
      World Health Organization (WHO) recommended healthcare providers to use practical,&#xD;
      standardised case management guidelines for childhood pneumonia care.5,6 However, these&#xD;
      guidelines do not include lung auscultation in their pneumonia definition for frontline&#xD;
      healthcare workers6 because of its high inter-observer variability and subjectivity,&#xD;
      regardless of healthcare providers training level.7-11 Digital auscultation by electronic&#xD;
      stethoscopes may overcome these limitations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An innovative, low-cost digital auscultation device was developed especially for children&#xD;
      called Smartscope. The Smartscope improves lung signal strength by uniformly distributing&#xD;
      highly sensitive electret microphone arrays across the stethoscope diaphragm so that the&#xD;
      entire audible spectrum can be captured, a critical feature for identifying higher frequency&#xD;
      pathologic lung sounds. It's rechargeable battery can power &gt;20 hours of use, important in&#xD;
      rural communities with inconsistent electricity. The device mitigates movement artifact and&#xD;
      tubular resonance by using an ergonomic design to better secure the device on the child's&#xD;
      chest. It also eliminates the rubber stethoscope tubing, a source of ambient noise and&#xD;
      friction contamination. It includes an integrated external microphone that removes unwanted&#xD;
      ambient noises. The Smartscope also permits onboard data storage with a microSD card and is&#xD;
      equipped with automated analysis software.12 Smartscope has been successfully validated in&#xD;
      the laboratory against the Littmann 3200 electronic stethoscope and has demonstrated&#xD;
      comparable results. This Smartscope has the potential to be a highly specific respiratory&#xD;
      diagnostic tool that is feasible for use by community-based healthcare workers in LMICs. This&#xD;
      project proposes to evaluate the potential impact of digital auscultation at first level&#xD;
      facilities in rural Bangladesh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess whether lung sounds recorded using Smartscope in children by Community Health&#xD;
           Care Provider (CHCP) at CC meet pre-defined quality thresholds established by experts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the reliability and performance of the Smartscope Respiratory Detector&#xD;
           automated analysis algorithm on lung sounds recorded by CHCP using the Smartscope,&#xD;
           compared to reference interpretations by a paediatric listening panel.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Collect hypothesis-generating pilot data on the impact of digital auscultation on&#xD;
           treatment decision-making by CHCPs, assuming lung recordings as the reference, as well&#xD;
           as document equipment usability and durability during the project in order to understand&#xD;
           whether additional device refinements are necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Determine the acceptability of the Smartscope among CHCP and carers of children&#xD;
           evaluated with the Smartscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods A mixed-methods study will be conducted in rural Sylhet district of Bangladesh.&#xD;
      Bangladesh has established about 13,000 CCs, one each for ~6,000 people. CCs are staffed by a&#xD;
      CHCP with at least 12th-grade education and 3 months of pre-service training including&#xD;
      Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) guidelines. Twelve CCs will be selected&#xD;
      purposively in Zakiganj and Kanaighat sub-districts of Sylhet district. Additionally, a total&#xD;
      of 12 CHWs will be recruited and trained for this study. Each CHW will cover approximately&#xD;
      ~13,000 population with ~1,400 under-five children. CHWs will visit each child aged 0-59&#xD;
      months in her catchment area every other month. The CHW will evaluate the child for&#xD;
      signs/symptoms of pneumonia and question the mother or carer about any history of these&#xD;
      symptoms. All suspected pneumonia cases (history/observed cough or difficult breathing) will&#xD;
      be referred or accompanied to CCs with a referral slip for further evaluation and treatment.&#xD;
      A study physician will be recruited for providing training and supervision of CHCPs and CHWs&#xD;
      in clinical assessment, measurement of oxygen saturation and recording lung sound by the&#xD;
      Smartscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening: CHCPs in the CC will screen all under-five children as per protocol using a&#xD;
      screening form. Approximately 7,200 children will be screened. If the child becomes eligible,&#xD;
      the carer will be invited for consent to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolment: If the carer gives consent, the child will be enrolled in the study. A total of&#xD;
      1003 children with history/observation of cough or difficult breathing (possible pneumonia)&#xD;
      will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung auscultation: Lung sounds will be recorded using Smartscope. It is being used for its&#xD;
      intended purpose only.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sound collection: Enrolled children will have their lung sounds recorded at four&#xD;
           sequential locations (two anterior and two posterior chest positions) for ~10&#xD;
           seconds/position. The recording procedure lasts approximately 60 seconds and captures&#xD;
           3-4 full breath cycles/position. Daily or alternate day Smartscope lung sounds will be&#xD;
           uploaded to a server and securely stored. Later on, this lung sounds will be processed&#xD;
           and used by the personnel involved in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Sound processing: A novel sound-filtering algorithm will be applied to lung recordings&#xD;
           to reduce ambient noise and optimize lung sound quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Listening panel: Three practicing pediatricians will form the panel. One will serve as&#xD;
           the arbitrator and two as primary listeners. All panelists will be trained and&#xD;
           standardized to the methodology developed and validated during PERCH. Panelists will&#xD;
           generate one summary patient classification of normal, crackle, wheeze, crackle and&#xD;
           wheeze, or uninterpretable. Two primary listeners will independently classify the&#xD;
           recorded lung sounds, any discrepancies will be resolved through discussion, and if not&#xD;
           resolved then the third listener will arbitrate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Respiratory detector: The Respiratory Detector automated algorithm will be applied to&#xD;
           the lung recordings to generate an interpretation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulse oximetry: Pulse oximetry will also be performed using a Masimo® Rad5 oximeter to all&#xD;
      eligible consented children. If any child's oxygen saturation found &lt;90% will be referred to&#xD;
      the sub-district health center or Sylhet Osmani Medical College Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collecting socioeconomic and confounders data: CHW will collect socio-economic and other&#xD;
      related confounders' data including immunization information, weight, mid-upper arm&#xD;
      circumference and length/height from all enrolled cases at the household level within seven&#xD;
      days of enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focus group discussions: Four focus group discussions (FGDs) will be organized, two with&#xD;
      carers (one with female and one with male) and one with CHCPs and one with CC management&#xD;
      committee members and community leaders to share their opinions about the Smartscope. Each&#xD;
      FGD will consist of 8-12 participants. A trained moderator will lead the discussion about&#xD;
      perceptions of the Smartscope and the acceptability of Smartscope as a diagnostic for&#xD;
      pneumonia.&#xD;
