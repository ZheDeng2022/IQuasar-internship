  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants in this study will receive two treatments, placebo and ERX-963, on different&#xD;
      days in a randomized fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of ERX-963 in&#xD;
      participants diagnosed with Myotonic Dystrophy, Type 1 (DM1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary purpose is to evaluate the potential of ERX-963 treatment to reduce excessive&#xD;
      daytime sleepiness / hypersomnia and improve cognitive function in DM1 participants compared&#xD;
      to placebo treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is evaluating single administration of two dose levels of ERX-963 to explore the&#xD;
      relationship between dose, safety, tolerability, exposure and clinical benefit. This is a&#xD;
      multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-treatment period crossover&#xD;
      study in two cohorts of participants with DM1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who have consented and meet eligibility criteria will receive two treatments,&#xD;
      placebo and ERX-963, in a randomized crossover fashion with a washout period between the&#xD;
      treatments. On treatment days, participants will receive treatment followed by repeated blood&#xD;
      collection for pharmacokinetic analysis and administration of a battery of outcome measures&#xD;
      relevant to sleep and cognition.&#xD;

    <measure>Incidence of Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Events, and Drug-related Adverse Events [Safety and Tolerability] After a Single Dose of ERX-963 vs. Placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>Adverse Events were collected from screening to the End of Study Visit, up to 57 days</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of study intervention. Treatment-emergent AEs were AEs which started between the date and time of study drug dosing and through Study Day 2, within each period. Drug-related AEs were assessed by the investigator to determine the relationship (related or unrelated) between the study intervention and each AE occurrence.</description>

    <measure>Assess the Effect of ERX-963 on the Stanford Sleepiness Scale Score Compared to the Effect of Placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>From dosing to approximately 2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will self-report their level of sleepiness by self-rated questionnaire &quot;Stanford Sleepiness Scale&quot; (SSS). This is a single item questionnaire on a 7-point scale (1-7). Higher values indicate worse outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assess the Effect of ERX-963 on the Change in Patient Global Impression - Improvement Scale (PGI-I) Compared to Placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered at the end of the dosing visit day, upon completion of the other outcome measures. Approximately 2 hours after the end of infusion.</time_frame>
    <description>The PGI-I is a 7-point rating system used by the patient to rate their overall clinical condition after intervention relative to before intervention where 1=very much improved; 2=much improved; 3=minimally improved; 4=no change; 5=minimally worse; 6=much worse, and 7=very much worse.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assess the Effect of ERX-963 on the Clinical Global Impressment - Improvement (CGI-I) Scale Compared to Placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered at the end of the dosing visit day, upon completion of the other outcome measures. Approximately 2 hours after the end of infusion.</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-I is a 7-point rating system used by the clinician or investigator to compare the patient's overall clinical condition after intervention relative to before intervention where 1=very much improved; 2=much improved; 3=minimally improved; 4=no change; 5=minimally worse; 6=much worse, and 7=very much worse (Guy, 1976; Busner, 2007).</description>

        <title>Incidence of Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Events, and Drug-related Adverse Events [Safety and Tolerability] After a Single Dose of ERX-963 vs. Placebo</title>
        <description>An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of study intervention. Treatment-emergent AEs were AEs which started between the date and time of study drug dosing and through Study Day 2, within each period. Drug-related AEs were assessed by the investigator to determine the relationship (related or unrelated) between the study intervention and each AE occurrence.</description>
        <time_frame>Adverse Events were collected from screening to the End of Study Visit, up to 57 days</time_frame>
        <population>The safety population is defined as all participants who sign the study-specific informed consent documents and received at least 1 dose of ERX-963 or placebo.</population>
