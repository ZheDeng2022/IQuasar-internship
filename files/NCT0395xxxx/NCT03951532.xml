  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Early paediatric Basedow disease is one of the rare endocrine diseases for which the&#xD;
      Reference Centre for Rare Endocrine Growth Diseases, was approved by the Ministry of Health&#xD;
      in 2005. In addition, the study will benefit from the expertise of public Health France&#xD;
      (SFP). This study is therefore part of the missions of these partners (reference centre for&#xD;
      endocrine growth diseases and Public Health France).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For several years, our group has been interested in defining the evolutionary profile of&#xD;
      these patients. A national study on short- and long-term patient follow-up has already been&#xD;
      conducted, which has been the subject of two international publications29,30, as well as a&#xD;
      study on a specific clinical form of the disease 24. This work was made possible thanks to&#xD;
      the collaboration of paediatric clinical centres within the Reference Centre and Competence&#xD;
      Centre for Rare Endocrine Diseases Network. The present study planned in France will make it&#xD;
      possible to accurately characterize the care pathway and the frequency of complications&#xD;
      associated with it at the national level.&#xD;

      &quot;With regard to the analysis of data on the identification of hyperthyroidism in children&#xD;
      using the various medico-administrative databases, the epidemiological study of&#xD;
      hyperthyroidism in children in France seems feasible using data on drug consumption from the&#xD;
      SNIIRAM. These data will make it possible for the first time to study the impact of the&#xD;
      disease in terms of serious morbidity and mortality (related to the disease and/or treatment)&#xD;
      and to make recommendations for the management of the disease in order to improve the&#xD;
      prognosis of the disease in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thanks to these results, incidence data on the disease in children will be able to be&#xD;
      estimated for the first time in France, as well as its temporal and spatial trends. They will&#xD;
      be compared with national studies carried out in Sweden, Denmark and the United Kingdom on&#xD;
      children. The spatial distribution in France can also be studied and compared with existing&#xD;
      or emerging hypotheses, in particular concerning endocrine disrupters (French public health&#xD;
      data). These analyses could also allow the generation of new causal hypotheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, this work could lead to the establishment of national surveillance of&#xD;
      hyperthyroidism in children. Prolonged follow-up is necessary, even after the end of medical&#xD;
      treatment or after radical treatment, to determine the effectiveness of the management of&#xD;
      patients during childhood and the impact on their overall health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study should therefore make it possible to propose recommendations to optimize the&#xD;
      therapeutic management of hyperthyroidism in children and adolescents and improve the quality&#xD;
      of life in adulthood for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study is to describe the complications (morbidity and mortality)&#xD;
      associated with the 3 management modalities (treatment with synthetic antithyroid drugs&#xD;
      (ATS), radioactive iodine and thyroidectomy) of children followed for hyperthyroidism in&#xD;
      France, over a period of 11 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design chosen is that of an observational historical cohort study based on&#xD;
      medico-administrative data from the National Inter-Regime Health Insurance Information System&#xD;
      (SNIIRAM), which contains data from the PMSI (Information Systems Medicalization Program).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study period begins on 01.01.2006 and ends on 31.12.2017.&#xD;
