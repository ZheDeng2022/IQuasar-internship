  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To demonstrate the efficacy of ranolazine in improving coronary microvascular and diastolic&#xD;
      dysfunction in patients affected by HCM evaluating changes in maximum (i.e. during&#xD;
      dipyridamole-induced coronary vasodilatation) myocardial blood flow (MBF) measured by PET at&#xD;
      baseline and after 4 months of treatment with ranolazine in patients with non obstructive&#xD;
      HCM.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study aimed at assessing the effects of treatment with ranolazine, on top of&#xD;
      optimal standard medical therapy (according to international guidelines), on microvascular&#xD;
      dysfunction using PET in patients with HCM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty months of enrolment are foreseen. Patients enrolled in the study, at the end of the&#xD;
      titration phase will be treated with ranolazine 750 mg or 500 mg, 1 oral tablet twice a day&#xD;
      for 4 months on top of standard of care treatment. Visit 0,1,2,3 may be performed 3 days&#xD;
      before or 3 days after the planned date. Visit 4 and final PET scan may be performed 15 days&#xD;
      before or 15 days after the planned date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a superiority study. The sample size calculation is based on the ANOVA model, but the&#xD;
      statistical analysis will be performed applying the ANCOVA model for the absence of data on&#xD;
      the correlation between basal and end of study values of the primary variable studied. As&#xD;
      previously reported (Camici et al. J Am Coll Cardiol 1991; 17:879-86) maximum (i.e. during&#xD;
      dipyridamole stress) MBF is severely blunted in HCM (1.63±0.58 mL/min/g) compared to control&#xD;
      subjects (2.99±1.06 mL/min/g). For the primary end-point of the study using a two-sided test&#xD;
      at 5% significance level, with a power of 90% and a SD of ± 0.7 mL/min/gr, in order to detect&#xD;
      a change of 0.5 mL/min/gr in maximum MBF before and after treatment, 24 patients valid per&#xD;
      protocol are required.&#xD;
