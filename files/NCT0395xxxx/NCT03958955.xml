    <description>The IGA is an instrument used in clinical trials to rate the severity of the subject's global disease and is based on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe). In this trial, the IGA was a lesion-specific assessment and was evaluated separately for each of the 2 target lesions.</description>

    <description>The number of lesion-specific, treatment-related AEs per target lesion will be compared for active and vehicle treatment. Lesion-specific AEs are defined as lesional/perilesional AEs (i.e. AE location within the treatment area and/or ≤2 cm from the border of a target lesion).</description>

    <measure>Number of Lesions With ≥2-point Reduction in Erythema Score at Week 6 Compared to Baseline.</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 to Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The erythema score is lesion-specific and based on the Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index (CLASI) and the Revised CLASI (RCLASI) which are validated scoring systems to assess disease activity and damage in patients with cutaneous lupus erythematosus. The severity of the erythema is scored on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 to 3. The severity is scored from low to high with 0=absent and 3=dark red, purple/violaceous/crusted/haemorrhagic.</description>

    <description>The erythema score is lesion-specific and based on the CLASI and the RCLASI which are validated scoring systems to assess disease activity and damage in patients with cutaneous lupus erythematosus.

The severity is scored from low to high with 0=absent and 3=dark red, purple/violaceous/crusted/haemorrhagic.</description>

    <measure>Total Skin Disease Activity Score (Sum of Scores for Erythema, Scaling/Hyperkeratosis, and Oedema/Infiltration) at Week 6.</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The skin disease activity scores are based on the CLASI and the RCLASI which are validated scoring systems to assess disease activity and damage in patients with cutaneous lupus erythematosus. The total skin disease activity score is defined as the sum of the scores for 3 clinical signs (erythema, scaling/hyperkeratosis, oedema/infiltration) for each target lesion. For the total score and the individual clinical signs, higher scores indicate more severe symptoms. Erythema is scored on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (absent) to 3 (dark red, purple/violaceous/crusted/haemorrhagic). Hyperkeratosis/scaling is scored on a 3-point scale from 0 (absent) to 2 (verrucous hyperkeratosis). Oedema/infiltration is scored on a 3-point scale from 0 (absent) to 2 (palpable and visible). The total skin disease activity score can therefore range from 0 to 7.</description>

             prevalence of tuberculosis, close contact with a person with active tuberculosis, or a&#xD;
             history of active or latent tuberculosis where an adequate course of treatment cannot&#xD;
             be confirmed) must have been tested at screening.&#xD;

      <recruitment_details>37 subjects screened. 27 subjects randomised. 26 subjects completed.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A screening visit took place 7 to 28 days before the first application of investigational medicinal product (IMP). To be eligible for participation in the trial each subject had to have at least 2 discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) target lesions with active disease (referred to as lesions 1 and 2) fulfilling the inclusion criteria.</pre_assignment_details>

Erythema is scored on a 4-point scale from 0 (absent) to 3 (dark red, purple/violaceous/crusted/haemorrhagic), hyperkeratosis/scaling is scored on a 3-point scale from 0 (absent) to 2 (verrucous hyperkeratosis), and oedema/infiltration is scored on a 3-point scale from 0 (absent) to 2 (palpable and visible). The total skin disease activity score ranges from 0 to 7. Higher scores indicate more severe symptoms.</description>

          <title>Total skin disease activity score of lesions to be treated with vehicle</title>
          <description>The total skin disease activity score is defined as the sum of the investigator assessed scores for 3 clinical signs (erythema, scaling/hyperkeratosis, oedema/infiltration) of a lesion. Erythema is scored on a 4-point scale from 0 (absent) to 3 (dark red, purple/violaceous/crusted/haemorrhagic), hyperkeratosis/scaling is scored on a 3-point scale from 0 (absent) to 2 (verrucous hyperkeratosis), and oedema/infiltration is scored on a 3-point scale from 0 (absent) to 2 (palpable and visible). The total skin disease activity score ranges from 0 to 7. Higher scores indicate more severe symptoms.</description>

        <description>The skin disease activity scores are based on the CLASI and the RCLASI which are validated scoring systems to assess disease activity and damage in patients with cutaneous lupus erythematosus. The total skin disease activity score is defined as the sum of the scores for 3 clinical signs (erythema, scaling/hyperkeratosis, oedema/infiltration) for each target lesion. For the total score and the individual clinical signs, higher scores indicate more severe symptoms. Erythema is scored on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (absent) to 3 (dark red, purple/violaceous/crusted/haemorrhagic). Hyperkeratosis/scaling is scored on a 3-point scale from 0 (absent) to 2 (verrucous hyperkeratosis). Oedema/infiltration is scored on a 3-point scale from 0 (absent) to 2 (palpable and visible). The total skin disease activity score can therefore range from 0 to 7.</description>

      <restrictive_agreement>LEO Pharma A/S seeks publication of all clinical trials in peer-reviewed journals within 18 months after completion or termination of the clinical trial, regardless of whether the findings are positive or negative. If no publication is submitted by LEO Pharma A/S within these 18 months, the investigator has the right to publish the results from the clinical trial generated by him/herself.</restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>The trial was terminated prematurely due to slow recruitment, and due to an anticipation that recruitment would become further delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic affecting recruitment activities. The total number of subjects included in the trial therefore ended with 27 subjects randomised. 26 subjects completed the trial, as 1 subject withdrew from the trial due to an AE (moderate cutaneous lupus erythematosus [CLE]; reported term: cutaneous lupus erythematosus flare).</limitations_and_caveats>
