    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the impact of a personalized, partly supervised&#xD;
      rehabilitation program on the exercise capacity in patients with pulmonary hypertension. The&#xD;
      rehabilitation program consists of 2 weeks inpatient, 2 weeks ambulatory and 11 weeks home&#xD;
      based rehabilitation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study is a 15 weeks, randomized (1:1) controlled trial. Patients in both groups&#xD;
      will not change their usual medical treatment. After 2 clinical visits (screening and&#xD;
      randomization visit), patients in the intervention group will follow a 15 week rehabilitation&#xD;
      program consisting of 2 weeks inpatient, 2 weeks outpatient and 11 weeks home based&#xD;
      rehabilitation. At the end of the outpatient rehabilitation phase (week 4) and the home-based&#xD;
      program (week 15), clinical outcomes will be reassessed.&#xD;
