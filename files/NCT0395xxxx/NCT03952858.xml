  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background Older patients admitted to an Emergency Department (ED) are dependent on assistive&#xD;
      devices and almost 16 % have no gait function. It seems appropriate to identify patients who&#xD;
      need physical exercises immediately after discharge to avoid further functional decline. New&#xD;
      IT technologies make it possible to both supervise the exercises and communicate with the&#xD;
      patients via video conferencing equipment. Until now no studies have examined if the Otago&#xD;
      Exercise Program (OEP) supervised by video conferencing may enhance motivation and maintain&#xD;
      or improve physical functional capacity in acute elderly patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis Early telerehabilitation performed in groups based on the OEP is compared with&#xD;
      traditional exercise programs offered in the community centers in geriatric patients after&#xD;
      hospital discharge from acute care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a randomized, controlled study conducted at Aarhus University Hospital (AUH).&#xD;
      The population is elderly patients ≥65 years, residents in the Municipality of Aarhus and&#xD;
      admitted acutely from there own home to the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telerehabilitation Group (TG) will start telerehabilitation first to second week after&#xD;
      discharge. After the initial two training sessions, the patient will be included in a TG.&#xD;
      When there is a group of two to three participants the group will stop including more members&#xD;
      in that group in order to achieve the expected benefits of group exercising. It will be&#xD;
      possible for physiotherapists to follow the team on the screen and to communicate with the&#xD;
      participants. In addition, the participants may communicate with each other. The following&#xD;
      four weeks the patients will exercise on their own in their training groups on appointed&#xD;
      times via videoconferencing equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Control Group will receive the usual training offered by the municipality. Participants&#xD;
      in both groups will be tested with the same instruments at baseline and after four and eight&#xD;
      weeks and at six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspective If the presented project indicates that the older target group may benefit from&#xD;
      telerehabilitation immediately after discharge, elderly patients may increase their Quality&#xD;
      of Life and the municipalities may experience public savings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telerehabilitation may be a good alternative for patients who aren't able to receive training&#xD;
      at the community center for physical reasons. Telerehabilitation may be one of the means to&#xD;
      meet the challenge of the increasing proportion of elderly people in Denmark.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background The geriatric patient is often presented with a complex pathological picture,&#xD;
      where gait- and balance disturbances are independent risk factors for fall accidents, which&#xD;
      are common causes for admittance to hospital. One third of the medical patients discharged&#xD;
      after an acute hospitalization experience a decrease in functional capacity following one&#xD;
      year after. Impaired gait function also greatly influences the older persons' management of&#xD;
      their everyday life e.g. transportation, shopping, meals, and domestic tasks. It may induce&#xD;
      fear of falling and can lead to isolation and loneliness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A hip fracture may have fatal consequences. Half of those who are affected of a hip fracture&#xD;
      suffer from disabilities, and 15-25% dies within the first year after the trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A program combining exercises of muscle strength, body balance and endurance can break a&#xD;
      vicious spiral. Therefore, it seems appropriate to identify those patients who need physical&#xD;
      exercises during their hospital stay and immediately after discharge to avoid further&#xD;
      functional decline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise at home and improvement in the ability to undertake daily tasks are highly valued by&#xD;
      community-dwelling people 60 years and older. Communication between the older person and the&#xD;
      physiotherapist has positive effects on adherence to an exercise program and its outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New Telerehabilitation Technologies make it possible for the physiotherapist to supervise and&#xD;
      communicate with exercising participants by video conferencing equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Otago Exercises Program (OEP) is a home-based strength- and balance program and has&#xD;
      proven to reduce falls and injuries caused by fall by 35% in community dwelling older women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until now, no studies have examined if OEP supervised through video &quot;face to face&quot;&#xD;
      conferencing may maintain or even improve physical functional capacity in older acutely ill&#xD;
      patients just discharged to their home. No studies have investigated whether it is possible&#xD;
      to carry out Telerehabilitation in groups of geriatric patients aged 65 years or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective To compare the effect on physical functional capacity by two types of exercises: 1)&#xD;
      physiotherapist-supervised Telerehabilitation as home exercise in groups, 2) traditional&#xD;
      exercise programs offered in a community center for older people. The target population is&#xD;
      65+ years old home-dwelling medical- and hip fracture patients just discharged after an acute&#xD;
      hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early Telerehabilitation performed in groups based on the Otago exercise program is compared&#xD;
      with traditional exercise programs offered in the community centers in geriatric patients&#xD;
      after hospital discharge from acute care and supervised by a physiotherapist:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Maintain or improve the patient's physical functional abilities within 4 and 8 weeks and&#xD;
           6 months after discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Prevent loneliness and fear of falling, and maintain or improve the Quality of Life&#xD;
           within 4 and 8 weeks and 6 months after discharge Material and methods Design The study&#xD;
           is a randomized, controlled parallel-group (two groups), investigator-blinded study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population and setting The population is residents living in their own home in the&#xD;
      Municipality of Aarhus aged 65 years or older and acutely admitted to Aarhus University&#xD;
      Hospital (AUH) in the Emergency Department (ED), and the Departments of Geriatric. The study&#xD;
      will be conducted in the community centers for older people, and in the participants' own&#xD;
      home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants' recruitment procedure Recruitment will be performed by the project manager in&#xD;
      the hospital. All recruitments will be made on weekdays. Eligible patients discharged&#xD;
      directly from the ED on weekends or on public holidays will be included on the first weekday&#xD;
      after.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Participants who agree to participate will be randomized to either the&#xD;
      Telerehabilitation Group- or the Control Group by a computer-based block randomization via&#xD;
      REDCap. It is estimated that it will take about three to four weeks to include three&#xD;
      participants in the Intervention Group. It means that the last patient will be included four&#xD;
      weeks later than the first included patient. To give the optimal conditions for the home&#xD;
      exercise in groups we have in cooperation with the REDCap data manager chosen to modify the&#xD;
      randomization from a two block randomization to a three block randomization where two of the&#xD;
      blocks allocate participants to the Telerehabilitation Group. Additionally the randomization&#xD;
      will stratify the participants according to social status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection Data will be collected by a skilled test therapist investigator. A gap of&#xD;
      plus-minus two days in the re-test follow-up period is accepted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation To calculate the sample size we use an unpublished study from&#xD;
      Hvidovre Hospital (The Capital Region of Denmark). It is older patients who were admitted to&#xD;
      the ED that achieved an average score improvement of 1.8 points (SD: 12.8) in the De Morton&#xD;
      Mobility Index (DEMMI) after an exercise intervention from admission to four weeks after&#xD;
      discharge. DEMMI is a functional test measuring mobility. The Hvidovre study shows that it is&#xD;
      necessary to include 27 participants in each group to achieve statistical significance.&#xD;
      Likewise, we expect that the participants in our study belong to the same target group as&#xD;
      those in the study from Hvidovre, and that their calculation of the sample size also can be&#xD;
      applied in our study. It results in a total of 54 participants divided into two identical&#xD;
      groups. The study 'Early geriatric follow-up' finds that 16% of community dwelling elderly&#xD;
      died within the first 8 weeks after discharge, thus we added another 9 participants i.e.&#xD;
      total of 63 participants. Almost 11% will be transferred to a rehabilitation center after&#xD;
      discharge (unpublished ref), requiring a total of 70 participants. In an exercise study 22.6&#xD;
      % did not complete their training program, thus it is necessary to include 16 extra&#xD;
      participants resulting in a final number of 86 participants i.e. 43 participants in each&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study groups Participants in the Telerehabilitation Group receive supervised&#xD;
      Telerehabilitation by an experienced physiotherapist two days a week during four weeks with&#xD;
      at least one day of rest between each exercise session (in total: eight Telerehabilitation&#xD;
      sessions). Initially the physiotherapist visits the patient at home, and the patient will be&#xD;
      informed by a written pamphlet and orally about the exercise program, the benefits of&#xD;
      exercise and the expected effect of the program. The patient will be instructed in the use of&#xD;
      computer and receives a written guide. New clinical guidelines recommend that geriatric&#xD;
      patients should exercise for at least 8 weeks if clinical benefits are to be expected.&#xD;
      Therefore, after four weeks the participants will on their own continue OEP for another 4&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Telerehabilitation Group will start their exercise within the first week after discharge.&#xD;
      When there are a total of two to three participants in the Telerehabilitation Group we will&#xD;
      stop including more members in order to achieve the expected benefits of group exercising.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following four weeks the participants will exercise without supervision by a&#xD;
      physiotherapist. The training sessions will continue in their group on appointed times and it&#xD;
      will still be possible to communicate with the other participants via computer. Here OEP is&#xD;
      displayed on the computer by small video sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Control Group will receive the usual exercise programs offered in the community center&#xD;
      for older people. The exercise program can vary dependent on the offer in the individual&#xD;
      community center. Often the training consists of exercises carried out in a range of&#xD;
      different training equipment such as exercise bikes, steppers, rowing machines etc. often&#xD;
      supervised by a physiotherapist. At some community centers the training will be performed in&#xD;
      groups on appointed times. Participants in the Control Group will be tested by the same&#xD;
      instruments at baseline and after 4 and 8 weeks and at 6 months of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training intervention OEP consist of a walking plan, balance exercises, and a set of leg&#xD;
      muscle strengthening exercises all progressing in degree of difficulty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IT platform used in this study make it possible for up to eight persons to see and&#xD;
      communicate with each other. We decided because of the heterogeneity among the participants&#xD;
      and hereby their different levels of functional capacity to limit the number of participants&#xD;
      to three persons joining the intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of cancellation of exercise Participants in both groups who cannot attend the&#xD;
      exercise program due to illness, hospitalization or vacation, will remain in their exercise&#xD;
      group and finish training on the initially planned date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standardization of intervention Before starting the project period, the test investigator&#xD;
      will undergo training in performing the tests used in the project to ensure consistency&#xD;
      between the testers. The training will be based on the test's appurtenant manuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adherence To achieve the expected effects of the interventions it is crucial that the&#xD;
      participants are adherent to the interventions. Therefore the training physiotherapist will&#xD;
      register how many times the participants have participated in the training sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Control Group, the training physiotherapist in the municipality will be asked to&#xD;
      notice how many times participants have received training in the same period. Reasons for&#xD;
      non-participation will be noticed in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The statistical analysis will be conducted by using STATA (version 15,&#xD;
      STATA Corporation, Texas). Baseline data in the Intervention- and Control Group will be&#xD;
      compared and presented as means with standard deviations, medians with interquartile ranges&#xD;
      or frequencies with percentages depending on data characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The four time-point FRS mean score will be compared in the two groups in a univariate&#xD;
      repeated measurements ANOVA. We assume that the mean-differences are normally distributed,&#xD;
      the standard deviations between all time-points are equal, and the differences between all&#xD;
      time-point are correlated. We are testing the hypothesis of parallel mean curves with the&#xD;
      within and between subject variation between the groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Likewise, the four time-points in the DEMMI, and handgrip strength, FES-I, EQ-5 D, GDS and&#xD;
      UCLA scores will be tested. A multiple linear regression model is used to analyze if the&#xD;
      change in mobility is associated with the change in FES-I, UCLA and EQ-5D in all patients.&#xD;
      The model is adjusted for potentially mediating variables: gender, age, social status,&#xD;
      comorbidity, educational attainment, and alcohol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Publication process The results of the study will be presented at relevant internationally&#xD;
      conferences. The project manager is employed by Department of Geriatrics as a PhD student in&#xD;
      the period of data collection and analysis of data. Department of Geriatrics, Aarhus&#xD;
      University Hospital is warrantor of the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics The study is approved by the Research Ethics Committee of The Central Denmark Region&#xD;
      (1-10-72-394-17) and by the Danish Data Protection Agency (1-16-02-201-17). Participants will&#xD;
      be informed that participation is voluntary, they can withdraw at any time without losing&#xD;
      their right to treatment. Participants who agree to participate will be requested informed&#xD;
      consent. Once written informed consent is obtained from the participants during&#xD;
      hospitalization at the ED they will be included in the study. There will be given written and&#xD;
      verbal information about the study to ensure that everything is understood and possible&#xD;
      questions answered. The Ethic Committee will be informed if important protocol modifications&#xD;
      for approval. Communication between patient and therapist will be carried out via the&#xD;
      Internet in a secure system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding It is not possible to blind the participants in relation to the intervention. Also,&#xD;
      it is not possible to blind the physiotherapists who are training the participants according&#xD;
      to allocation. It is possible, however, to blind the test therapist who will not be advised&#xD;
      about to which group the participant is randomized. The primary investigator recruits the&#xD;
      participants, screen them for eligibility and collects baseline data before randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion In a RCT design, the effect of Telerehabilitation within the first week after&#xD;
      hospital discharge will be evaluated and compared with the usual training intervention in the&#xD;
      municipality in home-dwelling geriatric patients. Change in physical function capacity,&#xD;
      loneliness, Quality of Life and fear of falling before and after the interventions are the&#xD;
      outcome measures.&#xD;
