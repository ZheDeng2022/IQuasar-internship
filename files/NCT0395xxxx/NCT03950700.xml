  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The third molars are the teeth that are most frequently included and impacted, extraction is&#xD;
      one of the most performed treatments by maxillofacial surgeons in their clinical practice.&#xD;
      Its surgical extraction is accompanied by an inflammatory process, which generates pain,&#xD;
      edema and trismus. The use of alternatives that offer prolonged analgesia, like the use of&#xD;
      bupivacaine, reduce the pain of the patient after an extraction of third molars, allows the&#xD;
      reduction of morbidity and the rapid return to daily activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, it allows a better experience in the dental consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators hypothesis is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Irrigation of the alveolus with 4 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine is effective for the reduction of&#xD;
      post-operative pain in extraction of impacted lower third molars&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clinical, randomized, experimental, single blind study. The sample for the present study will&#xD;
      consist of 40 patients who attend consecutively to maxillofacial surgery, to perform third&#xD;
      molar surgical extraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size defined for the present study is 40 patients, each with two extractions of&#xD;
      third molars for a total of 80 extractions that will be randomized in each patient for the&#xD;
      treatment of Bupivacaine and saline respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the calculation of statistical power with the sample size previously defined to compare&#xD;
      the postoperative pain level 4, 12 and 24 hours after the extraction of lower third molars in&#xD;
      two groups (Bupivacaine and saline).&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the sample size, investigators defined, calculated, statistical power, test and use,&#xD;
      comparison, pain levels, at 4 and 12 hours, with a power greater than 90%. The study will&#xD;
      have sufficient power for the study to be conclusive, regardless of whether it finds&#xD;
      statistically significant differences or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgical procedure will be performed by a single oral and maxillofacial surgeon,&#xD;
      following the same surgical technique for the extraction of impacted molars, in all patients,&#xD;
      including the sulcular flap up to the second molar, with a posterior complementary incision&#xD;
      of 45 degrees, without anterior incision Complementary. The osteotomy is performed with a&#xD;
      high speed carbide surgical bur. The patients will not receive a previous medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all patients, both impacted lower third molars are surgically removed in one session,&#xD;
      beginning the extractions in the right side. Subsequently, one of the alveolus will be&#xD;
      irrigated with 4ml of bupivacaine 0.5% with adrenaline vasoconstrictor 1: 200,000 (BUPIROP®&#xD;
      0.5%), the contralateral alveolus will be irrigated with 4 ml of saline solution 0.9% (Baxter&#xD;
      laboratories) prior to the placement of the suture for the closure of the surgical wound,&#xD;
      using the aspiration to avoid the exit of the medication out of the alveolus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The decision to use another substance for the irrigation of the alveolus will be taken in a&#xD;
      randomized manner.Through numerical assignment according to the order of surgical scheduling.&#xD;
      The patients with even numbers are irrigated on the right side with bupivacaine and on the&#xD;
      left side with saline. Patients with odd numbers will be irrigated in the opposite way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before starting the surgical procedure, the disposable syringes will be marked with their&#xD;
      respective content, either bupivacaine 0.5% or saline solution 0.9%, each with 4 ml of the&#xD;
      medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be considered blinded to the drug of choice, and patients will not know what&#xD;
      type of solution will be administered on each side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be medicated with: amoxicillin 500mg every 6 hours for 7 days,&#xD;
      acetaminophen 500mg every 6 hours for 5 days, and ibuprofen 400mg every 6 hours for 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative pain will be evaluated at 4, 12 and 24 hours after surgery, using the pain&#xD;
      visual analog scale from 1 to 10, by telephone call. Patients will be instructed to rate&#xD;
      their pain intensity on each side from one to ten.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information collected in the form will be digitized in a spreadsheet in Excel, to be&#xD;
      analyzed in the program IBM® SPSS® version 21. All independent quantitative variables will be&#xD;
      summarized by descriptive statistics (average or median, standard deviation o Interquartile&#xD;
      range), while qualitative variables will be described with proportions. To compare the pain&#xD;
      levels between the two treatments at 4, 12 and 24 hours, the Student's t-test for independent&#xD;
      samples or, failing that, the Mann-Whitney U-test will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to this analysis, the normality of the postoperative pain variable (analogous visual&#xD;
      scale) will be assessed using the Shapiro Wilk test. A level of significance of 5% will&#xD;
      always be assumed for the contrasting statistical tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The univariate descriptive analysis will be presented through a summary table. In addition,&#xD;
      an error bar graph will be used to show the levels of postoperative pain for each treatment&#xD;
      at 4, 12 and 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical trial embraces the Declaration of Helsinki of ethical principles for medical&#xD;
      research in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to carrying out the study, each of the participants will be explained what the research&#xD;
      consists of, participants will be informed about possible adverse reactions to the local&#xD;
      anesthetic Bupivacaine, such as drug reaction, altered blood pressure and heart rate, nausea.&#xD;
      , vomiting, headaches and allergic skin reactions. At all times there will be a diligent&#xD;
      management of the therapy and close observation establish the rules for the handling of&#xD;
      personal data in clinical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An informed consent will be given to each patient, who will read and explain what is&#xD;
      stipulated in it before consenting, to ensure that the participant who signs the informed&#xD;
      consent agrees to perform the procedure as stipulated in the statement of the investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The privacy of the individual, subject of investigation, will be protected, identifying it&#xD;
      only when the results require it and this authorizes it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigation will be suspended immediately, upon noticing any risk or damage to the&#xD;
      health of the subject in whom the investigation is carried out.&#xD;
