      Background/Introduction: The Ultravision™ System is an FDA-cleared medical device that&#xD;
      removes surgical smoke by means of electrostatic precipitation from the visual field during&#xD;
      laparoscopic surgical procedures. &quot;Surgical smoke&quot; refers to the suspended particulate matter&#xD;
      that is generated as a by-product of the combustion and other processes that are associated&#xD;
      with the use of energy-based surgical instruments. Surgical smoke can obscure (partially or&#xD;
      totally) the surgeon's view of the operative field and this has obvious safety implications&#xD;
      for the patient. In the case of laparoscopic procedures, which are increasing in popularity,&#xD;
      the smoke is retained within the &quot;closed abdomen&quot; and this, coupled with the CO2&#xD;
      pneumoperitoneum, presents additional challenges for the surgical team. The Ultravision™&#xD;
      System can therefore be considered an accessory to electrosurgical instruments to clear the&#xD;
      surgical smoke generated during their use and as such will only be used when such devices are&#xD;
      in use. The ability to operate at under &quot;low impact&quot; laparoscopic conditions has been shown&#xD;
      by others to improve clinical outcomes by, for example, reducing post-surgical pain and with&#xD;
      smaller incision sizes, improved cosmesis. For the purposes of this study &quot;low impact&quot; is&#xD;
      defined as (1) a target pneumoperitoneal pressure of 10mm Hg; and (2) instead of 10mm and/or&#xD;
      12mm ports, the use of 3mm ports and one 5mm port. Using a standard insufflator, the&#xD;
      combination of lower pneumoperitoneal pressure and smaller size ports creates visualization&#xD;
      challenges for the surgeon due to the difficulty of preventing the buildup of surgical smoke&#xD;
      within the abdomen. &quot;Venting&quot; or actively extracting the smoke through a trocar is known to&#xD;
      be largely ineffective due to the narrow internal diameter of 3mm trocars, certainly unless&#xD;
      the instrument is removed beforehand, which creates additional surgical challenges.&#xD;
      Furthermore, operating under lower pressure can cause pneumoperitoneum to be lost upon&#xD;
      venting of the smoke. The research question that is posed in this study is whether the&#xD;
      Ultravison™ System, due to its unique mode of action which (unlike other smoke management&#xD;
      approaches) provides smoke management without needing to extract or exchange CO2, provides&#xD;
      effective visual field clearing, thereby facilitating low impact laparoscopic surgery when&#xD;
      using a conventional insufflator. In addition, Ultravision™ does not require CO2 removal and&#xD;
      replacement to achieve its intended use, thereby minimizing to the greatest extent possible&#xD;
      patient CO2 exposure. CO2 is dry (effectively 0% relative humidity) and cold (typically 65F)&#xD;
      and exposure is linked to postoperative pain and other adverse consequences such as patient&#xD;
      cooling and tissue desiccation. Due its mode of action, Ultravision™ minimizes CO2 exposure&#xD;
      to the patient. Laparoscopic surgery for the treatment of endometriosis is a common procedure&#xD;
      for the removal of mild to moderate endometriosis. Diathermy is commonly used to remove the&#xD;
      lesions which can be extensive, therefore this procedure presents an appropriate surgical&#xD;
      procedure for this study. Assessments in terms of surgical field visualization, CO2&#xD;
      consumption, end tidal CO2, patient satisfaction for cosmesis, and postoperative pain will be&#xD;
      conducted in order to determine if the Ultravision™ System is effective in enabling&#xD;
      laparoscopic surgery under low impact laparoscopic conditions. Adverse event information will&#xD;
      be reported. The study is an open label single arm study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Purpose: There are five main study objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Demonstrate the feasibility of undertaking low impact laparoscopic surgery for&#xD;
           endometriosis when using the Ultravision™ System.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess the impact of Ultravision on visual field clarity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine the ability to complete the procedure while maintaining an abdominal pressure&#xD;
           of &lt; 10mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Quantify the consumption of CO2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Collect data on additional clinical outcomes associated with the use of Ultravision and&#xD;
           low impact surgery (i.e. end tidal CO2 levels (EtCO2), adverse events, cosmesis outcome,&#xD;
           postoperative pain levels and pain medications).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypothesis: The primary hypothesis being tested in this study is that Ultravision&#xD;
      facilitates the utilization of low impact laparoscopic surgery techniques whilst maintaining&#xD;
      an adequate visual field throughout the procedure with low demand for CO2 replenishment to&#xD;
      maintain pneumoperitoneal pressure. Study Population The study will enroll patients indicated&#xD;
      for laparoscopic surgery to treat endometriosis. Patients must meet all inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: This is a prospective single arm study. The study will enroll 20 patients.&#xD;
      Comparisons to prior clinical trials and published literature will be made to assess the&#xD;
      relative significance of the study results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Endpoints: Success will be based on demonstration that the procedures using the&#xD;
      Ultravision™ System achieves the following endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The ability to complete the procedure without increasing pneumoperitoneum due to&#xD;
           visualization. Any increase beyond 10mm Hg and the reason for change will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The quality of visualization in the laparoscopic field of view will be assessed by the&#xD;
           investigator using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patient satisfaction in cosmesis outcome at the discharge follow-up visit assessed by&#xD;
           means of a survey scaled from &quot;very unsatisfied&quot; to &quot;very satisfied.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patient postoperative pain assessments. Recorded by the patient each day from day 1 to&#xD;
           day 7 postoperative using a 10 Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) where 0 is &quot;no pain at all&quot;&#xD;
           to 10 &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot; and the location of the pain using a body diagram.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Amount and type of pain medication administered postoperatively. Recorded by the patient&#xD;
           each day from day 1 to day 7 postoperative, and in person at final follow-up visit&#xD;
           (study discharge visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  End tidal CO2 volume (etCO2) (taken at the start of the procedure and at the completion&#xD;
           of the procedure),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse Events,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrosurgical instrument(s) used,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preoperative assessment: patient demographics, medical history, medication information,&#xD;
           height and weight, pain (at intake visit)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimate of case complexity/difficulty will be recorded. Study Size: A sample size of 20&#xD;
           patients should provide a sufficient sample size for comparative analysis to prior&#xD;
           clinical data relative to Ultravision and published peer reviewed clinical data on&#xD;
           laparoscopy and low impact laparoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Study: The target for the overall duration of the study is four months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis: Descriptive statistics for all endpoints will be applied to analyze the&#xD;
      results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intended Use(per instuctions for use): The Ultravision™ System is indicated for the clearance&#xD;
      of smoke and other particulate matter that is created during laparoscopic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Device Description: The Ultravision™ System is an accessory to electrosurgical instruments&#xD;
      that is used to clear the surgical smoke generated during their use and as such will only be&#xD;
      used when such devices are in use. The system includes the following elements: Standalone&#xD;
      battery-operated generator unit Ionwand™, which is introduced into the abdomen of the patient&#xD;
      through either the Ultravision™ 5mm Trocar or a 2.5mm percutaneous catheter and provides the&#xD;
      source of the electrons that create the negative ions that transiently charge the surgical&#xD;
      smoke particles. Other accessories include a patient return adaptor and battery recharging&#xD;
      station.&#xD;
&#xD;
      US Regulatory Status: The Ultravision™ System obtained regulatory clearance through US FDA's&#xD;
      De Novo Classification Process (DEN 150022). The system has been in distribution in Europe&#xD;
      since January 2014 and in the US since December of 2016, over 250 systems are currently in&#xD;
      use. To date there have been no incident or medical device reports (patient injury reports)&#xD;
      and there have been no product recalls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Identification &amp; Selection: Potential subjects will be identified from the clinical&#xD;
      practice of the participating investigator or by their respective research staff. Patients&#xD;
      presenting to the clinical practice of the participating investigator for diagnosis or&#xD;
      treatment consistent with the inclusion criteria will be informed about the study. With&#xD;
      referral from the treating physician, patients scheduled for surgery prior to the start of&#xD;
      the study may be contacted via telephone by a study team member to inform them of the study,&#xD;
      assess their interest and assess their eligibility to participate. An IRB approved script&#xD;
      will be used for such calls. For interested patients, a copy of the informed consent can be&#xD;
      mailed or emailed to the patient for their review and consideration prior to their next&#xD;
      clinic visit or the scheduled procedure. Each new subject presenting for evaluation or&#xD;
      inclusion is to be assessed for adherence to the following inclusion/exclusion criteria.&#xD;
      Determination of whether subjects satisfy the criteria may be established by review of&#xD;
      medical records, subject interview, physical examination, or testing as appropriate. A&#xD;
      baseline form is used to collect subject screening information and baseline assessments.&#xD;
      Patients are considered enrolled once it has been demonstrated that the inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
      criteria have been met and the patient signs the informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Informed Consent: A partial waiver of HIPAA Authorization is being requested for the&#xD;
      purposes of initial screening for study eligibility and recruitment purposes. Identifiable&#xD;
      health information to be accessed under this waiver will include contact information,&#xD;
      demographics, and medical history. Only study team members will have access to this&#xD;
      information. Safeguards to maintain privacy and confidentiality of information will be taken&#xD;
      as described in the data collection and management section of the protocol. Patient inclusion&#xD;
      could be substantially hindered without the ability to review patients' records for&#xD;
      eligibility and recruitment purposes, particularly for patients who may have already been&#xD;
      scheduled for surgery at the time the study begins. Referred patients presenting for&#xD;
      diagnosis or treatment consistent with the inclusion/exclusion criteria will undergo the&#xD;
      informed consent process to authorize the gathering of data recorded on the Subject Screening&#xD;
      &amp; Enrollment Form. The study investigator will administer informed consent or may delegate&#xD;
      the responsibility to a qualified individual as long as it is defined on the study&#xD;
      responsibility log. When administering consent, it must be evident that the participant&#xD;
      comprehends the nature of the study and the risks and benefits. Evidence is the patient is&#xD;
      able to verbalize these topics in sufficient detail to confirm comprehension. Completion of&#xD;
      the informed consent does not constitute enrollment. Enrollment occurs once screening is&#xD;
      complete and all criteria for participation have been met. Subjects must document their&#xD;
      consent for study participation by signing the Institutional Review Board approved Informed&#xD;
      Consent Form. The informed consent process must be consistent with the Declaration of&#xD;
      Helsinki. The subject must be given the opportunity to ask questions of, and receive answers&#xD;
      from, study personnel prior to a request to sign the Informed Consent Form. This form is to&#xD;
      be co-signed by the investigator. Failure to obtain consent prior to subject participation is&#xD;
      considered a protocol deviation and must be reported to the Institutional Review Board. After&#xD;
      the subject and investigator sign the Informed Consent Form, the original is to be filed in&#xD;
      the subject's study binder. Copies will be filed in the subject's medical record and the&#xD;
      subject is also to be given a copy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening &amp; Enrollment: Patient demographics and other baseline information will be collected&#xD;
      to establish whether the patient meets the requirements for the study. It is assumed that a&#xD;
      physical exam will be conducted as part of the standard of care. Each patient will be&#xD;
      assigned a unique study number. Baseline information will be collected, consistent with the&#xD;
      standard of care. Baseline assessment is conducted at the preoperative visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure Protocol: The device is used in accordance with the instructions for use. An&#xD;
      initial target pneumoperitoneal pressure setting of 10mmHg will be used for the procedure. At&#xD;
      the discretion of the surgeon investigator, pressure will be adjusted as needed to accomplish&#xD;
      the surgical procedure. A standard insufflator with 3mm ports and one 5 mm ports will be used&#xD;
      for the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgeon Survey: Immediately post procedure the investigator will be asked to provide feedback&#xD;
      regarding visibility, smoke management and complexity of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Overall quality of visualization (responses will be recorded on a VAS scale).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. How often was smoke management a negative factor during the procedure (responses will be&#xD;
           recorded on a VAS Scale).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Complexity of the procedure (simple, routine or complex).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post Procedure Follow-Up Protocol: Post-operative days 1-7:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to complete a daily diary/self-assessment of pain. Assessment will&#xD;
      include a pain rating, location of pain and medications taken for pain. The&#xD;
      diary/self-assessment is included as a separate document.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative 2 week (± 3 days) follow up visit: A 2 week follow up visit is current&#xD;
      standard of care. At this visit, adverse events will be assessed. A final pain assessment&#xD;
      will be administered during this visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative 4 week (± 1 week) follow up phone call: Patient satisfaction for cosmesis&#xD;
      (scar appearance) after the surgery will be collected by means of a telephone follow-up where&#xD;
      a simple cosmesis satisfaction survey will be administered by a study team member.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse Event Categories: For purposes of this protocol the adverse event definitions are&#xD;
      derived from Good Clinical Practice (GCP) standards and FDA Guidance. The signs, symptoms,&#xD;
      and sequelae of an underlying adverse event (linked pathophysiologically to the AE) should&#xD;
      not be reported as separate adverse events. All adverse events, of any type, are to be&#xD;
      recorded on an &quot;Adverse Event Form&quot;. Adverse events are to be characterized by their&#xD;
      severity, relatedness the implant procedure, need for therapy, and resolution status. Adverse&#xD;
      events will initially be characterized as &quot;serious&quot; or &quot;non-serious&quot; by the study&#xD;
      investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse Event Adjudication: Events are to be initially judged by the investigator as to their&#xD;
      relatedness to the study device, surgical procedure, or &quot;other etiology&quot;. The classifications&#xD;
      will be &quot;not related&quot;, &quot;probably not related&quot;, &quot;undetermined&quot;, &quot;probably related&quot;, or&#xD;
      &quot;related&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reporting of Adverse Events and Unanticipated Problems: Serious adverse events and&#xD;
      Unanticipated Problems related to the research will be reported to the Mercy Institutional&#xD;
      Review Board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequent Surgical Interventions: Some complications may lead to a subsequent surgical&#xD;
      intervention. The reason for each subsequent surgical intervention and the action taken is&#xD;
      recorded on the case report form, along with the identification of the type subsequent&#xD;
      surgical interventions according. The exact type of intervention must be specified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Withdrawal: A patient may choose to withdraw from participation in the study at any&#xD;
      time without penalty. If a patient chooses to withdraw, they will still receive medical care&#xD;
      consistent with the standard of care. The investigator may at their discretion withdraw a&#xD;
      patient from participation or where intraoperative exclusions (defined in the I/E criteria)&#xD;
      occur. Other examples include if the procedure necessitates conversion from laparoscopic to&#xD;
      open technique, lack of adherence to visit schedule, adverse events, or safety concerns. For&#xD;
      all withdrawals the date, point in the study, and reason for withdrawal will be recorded.&#xD;
      Patients that withdraw prior to the procedure or are withdrawn from the study due to an&#xD;
      intraoperative exclusion are replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Suspension/Termination: If for any reason the principle investigator chooses to suspend&#xD;
      or terminate the study, the IRB shall be informed of the decision and the basis of the&#xD;
      decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Provision and Inventory of Study Devices: The device and required materials will be provided&#xD;
      to the Investigator by Alesi Surgical Ltd.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection and Management: The investigator and study team members as delegated are&#xD;
      responsible for collecting the data from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging Diagnostics: All imaging performed for patients is considered consistent with&#xD;
      standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Justification: Ultravision is already cleared by the FDA for use in laparoscopic&#xD;
      endometriosis. This post-market study is intended to evaluate user satisfaction and the&#xD;
      relative impact the Ultravision™ System has on the procedure as opposed to demonstrating&#xD;
      safety and efficacy. The sample size selected (20) is considered to be a sufficient quantity&#xD;
      to establish whether or not low impact surgery is facilitated with the use of the&#xD;
      Ultravision™ System. This is designed as a single arm study to demonstrate feasibility of&#xD;
      device use under low impact laparoscopy. The Ultravision will either enable the procedure to&#xD;
      be completed as planned or not, therefore a control arm is not considered necessary to make&#xD;
      this determination. In addition, incorporating a control arm using the same conditions&#xD;
      without the use of Ultravision may not be in the best interest of the patient. The study&#xD;
      design is considered to appropriate for the research question that is being posed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis: Data collected will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Results from&#xD;
      other studies conducted by Alesi as well as clinical data gleaned from the medical literature&#xD;
      will be used to assess the relative significance of the study results. Additional exploratory&#xD;
      analysis may be conducted during data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training Procedures: The Principal Investigator in the study is a current Ultravision user,&#xD;
      no additional device training is required. To ensure compliance with the study plan and&#xD;
      regulatory requirements as well as accurate data collection, site training will include a&#xD;
      detailed review of this Investigational Plan, case report form (CRF) completion instructions,&#xD;
      adverse event reporting, device handling and inventory, monitoring logistics, and regulatory&#xD;
      requirements.&#xD;

      measures, post procedure pain assessments, pain medication, cosmesis result, and adverse&#xD;
      event information do not introduce new risks to the patient. If necessary, the investigator&#xD;
      will increase the pressure required to achieve adequate visualization/working space.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As surgical accessory devices, the Ultravision does not administer any medical treatment. The&#xD;
      risks associated with its use are consistent with other surgical accessories used in&#xD;
      laparoscopic surgery. The Ultravision™ System is required to undergo testing for sterility,&#xD;
      biocompatibility, and electrical safety in order to demonstrate that such risks have been&#xD;
      mitigated to acceptable levels. The benefits that are being evaluated in this study are&#xD;
      quality of visualization under low impact laparoscopic conditions with the anticipated&#xD;
      improvement in patient outcomes in terms of cosmesis and postoperative pain.&#xD;
