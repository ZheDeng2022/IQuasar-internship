  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a multiple centers, single-dose, open-label, randomized two-sequence crossover,&#xD;
      two-period study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of single doses of Diazepam Buccal&#xD;
      Film (DBF) compared with Diastat® Rectal Gel (DRG) under fed conditions in adult male and&#xD;
      female participants on a stable concomitant regimen of anti-epileptic drugs for the treatment&#xD;
      of epilepsy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Period 1 was a randomized, 2-sequence, crossover study in which participants received DBF and&#xD;
      DRG following a moderate-fat meal in a randomized sequence with a washout period of 28 days&#xD;
      between doses. DBF dose was based on body weight according to the currently recommended dose&#xD;
      regimen (derived by Aquestive from population PK modeling in healthy volunteers). DRG dose&#xD;
      was based on body weight according to the current product labeling for DRG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Period 2: Participants who completed Period 1 were asked to participate in a second period on&#xD;
      a voluntary basis during which volunteers received a second dose of DBF administered at the&#xD;
      same dose and in exactly the same manner as the earlier dose of DBF with the exception that&#xD;
      DBF was administered following a high-fat meal.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The study consisted of 2 periods. In Period 1 , participants received a single dose of Diazepam Buccal Film or Diastat Rectal Gel in a randomized sequence following a moderate fat meal with a 28-day washout between doses. Subjects who completed Period 1 were asked to participate in a second period (Period 2) on a voluntary basis. Those subjects who agreed to participate in Period 2 received a second dose of DBF in exactly the same dose and manner as the earlier dose with the exception it was administered following a high fat meal.</intervention_model_description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>A total of 43 healthy (except for seizure disorder) volunteers were screened for eligibility in this study.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>31 of the 43 screening participants were enrolled and randomized at 5 study sites in the United States. Of those not randomized, 7 did not meet protocol eligibility criteria and 5 were judged eligible but decided not to participate or were not selected to participate in the study since there was already a sufficient number of subjects.</pre_assignment_details>
