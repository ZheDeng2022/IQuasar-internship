  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of ASP9801 and to&#xD;
      determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). The study will also evaluate antitumor&#xD;
      activity, objective response rate, pharmacokinetics and virus shedding of ASP9801.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of two parts: dose escalation and recommended phase 2 dose expansion. Each&#xD;
      part of the study will include two separate groups of participants. Group A will include&#xD;
      participants who will have cutaneous/subcutaneous tumors injected, and group B will include&#xD;
      participants who will have visceral tumors injected. The study will consist of the following&#xD;
      periods: screening, initial treatment period (two 28 day cycles), optional extended treatment&#xD;
      period (continued 28 day cycles) and a follow up period (safety and survival follow up).&#xD;

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered an investigational product (IP), and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of IP whether or not considered related to the IP.</description>
