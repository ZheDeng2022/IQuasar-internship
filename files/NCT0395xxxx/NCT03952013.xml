  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Health literacy is the ability to access, understand, evaluate and apply information in order&#xD;
      to communicate with health professionals and understand health instructions but also,&#xD;
      promote, maintain and improve health throughout life. Health literacy (HL) is known as a&#xD;
      health determinant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An association has been shown between low HL and poorer health outcomes such as increased&#xD;
      number of unscheduled hospitalisation or emergency visits, low medication adherence and poor&#xD;
      health status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These have been particularly demonstrated with cardiovascular diseases, which combine risk&#xD;
      factors (emergency hospitalization, reduction in the length of hospital stays, and complex&#xD;
      secondary preventive drug treatments). Despite large scientific international literature&#xD;
      about HL and health outcomes, no information is available in France on the prevalence of low&#xD;
      HL level among patients managed for neuro-cardio-vascular diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been shown in other countries that healthcare professionals overestimate the HL level&#xD;
      of their patients and do not adapt information to the HL level. Therefore, patients with low&#xD;
      HL do not understand and/or are not able to use properly the information they receive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Having a better knowledge of HL level and characteristics in these patients is necessary to&#xD;
      develop tools for helping healthcare professionals to identify patients with low HL level and&#xD;
      to realize the role of HL as a determinant of health. It will also provide more precise&#xD;
      information on the difficulties or needs of patients with different levels of health&#xD;
      literacy.&#xD;

    <description>Health literacy will be measured using the Brief Health Literacy Screening (BHLS) questionnaire.&#xD;
The BHLS is known to screen quickly health literacy with 3 questions corresponding to 3 dimensions of the Health and Labour Questionnaire (HLQ): Enough information to manage health, Ability to actively engage with healthcare providers and Sufficient understanding to know what to do.</description>

    <description>All eligible patients included into one of the three existing cohorts studies of Hospices Civils de Lyon's hospitals: LOOP-HF, HIBISCUS-STEMI and HIBISCUS-STROKE&#xD;
LOOP-HF (Registry of Congestive Heart Failure, NCT03422991),&#xD;
HIBISCUS-STEMI (Prospective cohort with a heart attack from ST segment elevation myocardium admitted to the centre coronary angiography room participating investigators, NCT03070496)&#xD;

    <intervention_name>To explore health literacy levels in patients hospitalized for acute neuro-cardiovascular diseases i.e. stroke, myocardial infarction, or heart failure</intervention_name>
    <description>All patients included and followed within one of the three cohorts studies: LOOP-HF, HIBISCUS-STEMI and HIBISCUS-STROKE who accepted to participate in the study, will be contacted by phone (attempted calls are set to 3 to reach the patient), mail or during a consultation, to answer to a health literacy questionnaire. The patient will participate in the study only once. The estimated duration is therefore estimated at 1 day for each patient and two month for the study. Thanks to the many following periods within the cohorts (6 months, 1 year and 18 month), we will measure health literacy at different times of the care.</description>
