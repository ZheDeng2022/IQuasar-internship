      Introduction Laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery is considered standard of care in surgical&#xD;
      treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and is not without risks of adverse effects,&#xD;
      most notably disruption of the fundoplication, post-fundoplication dysphagia and&#xD;
      gas-bloat-syndrome, in some cases leading to reoperation. Non-surgical factors such as&#xD;
      pre-existing anxiety or depression disorders can influence postoperative satisfaction and&#xD;
      symptom relief. Previous studies have focused on short-term follow-up or only certain aspects&#xD;
      of disease, resulting in a less than complete picture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate long-term patient-satisfaction and durability of&#xD;
      laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery in a large Danish cohort using comprehensive multimodal&#xD;
      follow-up, and using the results of follow-up, to develop a clinically applicable scoring&#xD;
      system usable in selecting patients for anti-reflux surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and analysis The study is a retrospective cohort study utilizing data from patient&#xD;
      records and follow-up with patient-reported quality of life as well as registry-based data.&#xD;
      The study population consists of all adult patients having undergone laparoscopic anti-reflux&#xD;
      surgery at The Department of Surgery, Kolding Hospital, a part of Lillebaelt Hospital Denmark&#xD;
      in an 11-year period. From electronic records; patient characteristics, preoperative&#xD;
      endoscopic findings, reflux disease characteristics and details on type of surgery, will be&#xD;
      identified. Disease specific quality-of-life and dysphagia will be identified from&#xD;
      patient-reported follow-up. From Danish national registries, data on comorbidity, reoperative&#xD;
      surgery, use of pharmacological anti-reflux treatment, mortality and socioeconomic factors&#xD;
      will be included. Primary outcome of this study is treatment success at follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics and dissemination For the study approval will be sought from The Danish Patient Safety&#xD;
      Agency, The Danish Health Data Authority and Statistics Denmark, complying to Danish and EU&#xD;
      current legislation. Inclusion in the study will require informed consent from participating&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;

      Aim To use registry-based data and long-term quality of life follow up after anti-reflux&#xD;
      surgery to quantify efficacy of treatment and to propose a clinically applicable tool to&#xD;
      improve patient selection for surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background Treatment of GERD consists of anti-secretory drugs, mainly proton pump inhibitors,&#xD;
      or anti-reflux surgery. Laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery is considered standard of care in&#xD;
      surgical treatment of gastro-esophageal reflux disease and with careful patient selection&#xD;
      based on thorough preoperative workup; symptom control and patient satisfaction are high&#xD;
      compared to medical therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite a tailored approach, laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery is not without risks of adverse&#xD;
      effects, most notably disruption of the fundoplication, post-fundoplication dysphagia and&#xD;
      gas-bloat-syndrome, in some cases leading to reoperation. Furthermore non-surgical factors&#xD;
      such as pre-existing anxiety or depression disorders can influence postoperative satisfaction&#xD;
      and symptom relief when compared to patients without concomitant psychological disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although few studies conclude that medical and surgical treatment of GERD have similar&#xD;
      effectiveness, disease-specific quality of life generally improves after anti-reflux surgery&#xD;
      and patient satisfaction is high. Depending on surgical procedure, the postoperative quality&#xD;
      of life, ranges from significantly increased compared to preoperative measurements, to&#xD;
      &quot;normal&quot; values as found in subjects devoid of GERD. 73-98% are satisfied with their&#xD;
      condition after surgery and would choose surgery again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up of randomized clinical trials have demonstrated, that anti-reflux surgery patients&#xD;
      use acid suppressing drugs, primarily proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy at postoperative&#xD;
      follow-up. Use have been considered minimal with &lt;20% using PPI-therapy and 27-44% using PPI&#xD;
      at five-year follow-up. A recent register-based study, demonstrated a greater number of&#xD;
      redeemed prescriptions of proton pump inhibitor after primary anti-reflux surgery, than&#xD;
      previously known. Five-, 10- and 15-year risks of long-term PPI use were 29.4%, 41.1% and&#xD;
      56.6%. However, this register-based study could not examine whether patients had objective&#xD;
      recurrence of reflux disease and also did not examine indication for treatment as well as&#xD;
      prescribing physician. From 2001 to 2011, 94,4% of PPI where prescribed in primary care and&#xD;
      it is unknown why post-fundoplication patients are prescribed PPI. It has previously been&#xD;
      demonstrated, that the use of acid suppressing drugs after anti-reflux surgery does not&#xD;
      necessarily correlate with abnormal acid exposure to the esophagus . In general, the use of&#xD;
      PPI has increased rapidly in Denmark, rising 243% from 2001 to 2011 despite more restrictive&#xD;
      guidelines and changes in reimbursement . It must also be taken under consideration that&#xD;
      although PPIs are a safe group of drugs, there are possible side effects such as increased&#xD;
      risk of fractures, interaction with platelet inhibitor Clopidogrel, increased risk of kidney&#xD;
      failure, pneumonia and hypomagnesaemia. As the majority of proton pump inhibitors are&#xD;
      prescribed by general practitioners and not by the surgical centers, surgeons have very&#xD;
      little knowledge of this aspect of life following anti-reflux surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery is more effective than medical management with regard to&#xD;
      short to medium length follow-up. Few studies provide long-term follow-up. After ten years,&#xD;
      the benefits of surgery seem to decrease, but there is still a significant improvement in&#xD;
      quality of life compared to preoperative measurements . Known causes of dissatisfaction are&#xD;
      postoperative complication, redo-fundoplication and developing new bothersome symptoms such&#xD;
      as gas-bloat and dysphagia combined with inadequate symptom relief.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis Long-term follow-up of anti-reflux surgery in combination with preoperative&#xD;
      evaluation can be used to evaluate treatment success for a large cohort of patients and to&#xD;
      create a clinically applicable tool for selecting patients for anti-reflux surgery predicting&#xD;
      success of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and materials Included in the study will be patients in the period 2002-2013 that had&#xD;
      anti-reflux surgery at Department of Surgery, Kolding Hospital (n=557). Primary indication&#xD;
      for surgery must be GERD (Nomesco: KJBC00-02).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using patient records preoperative evaluation, including comorbidity and perioperative data&#xD;
      will be registered. Postoperative complications within 30 days will be evaluated. Data on&#xD;
      redo-surgery will be extracted from the National Patient Registry. 30-day mortality (National&#xD;
      Civic Registry), data on socioeconomic status at primary surgery (The Integrated Database for&#xD;
      Labour Market), preoperative use of PPI 2 years before primary surgery (Danish National&#xD;
      Prescription Register) and information on psychiatric comorbidity (The Danish Psychiatric&#xD;
      Central Research Register) will be extracted. All patients in the cohort will be contacted&#xD;
      and included in follow-up evaluating specific quality of life (GERD-HRQL(59)) as well as&#xD;
      dysphagia. They will also be asked whether they use any acid suppressing drugs, which&#xD;
      physician prescribed them and the primary reason for use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Multiple logistic regression will be performed and used to establish&#xD;
      significant preoperative and perioperative predictors for success of treatment. Failure of&#xD;
      surgical treatment will be defined as any redo-surgery, consistent use of PPI&#xD;
      postoperatively, significantly reduced quality of life or low patient satisfaction. Variables&#xD;
      considered will be: demographics (age, sex, smoking, body mass index, employment status,&#xD;
      educational level and income), endoscopic findings (esophagitis, hiatal hernia), symptoms of&#xD;
      reflux (typical/atypical), comorbidity (ASA, Charlson Index, psychiatric comorbidity,&#xD;
      previous abdominal surgery), pH-measurement (acid/non-acid reflux), esophageal manometry&#xD;
      (normal, hyper- or hypomotility), preoperative quality of life and preoperative&#xD;
      PPI-consumption as well as operative data (duration of surgery, length of stay, type of&#xD;
      fundoplication, postoperative complications) respectively. Patients in the cohort having&#xD;
      redo-surgery performed at any point since primary surgery will be selected for separate&#xD;
      analysis examining comparing quality of life, patient satisfaction and predictive factors for&#xD;
      redo-surgery. Survival analysis of fundoplication clinical durability will also be performed.&#xD;
      The results will be used to create a clinically applicable scoring system facilitating&#xD;
      successful preoperative evaluation before anti-reflux surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming 90% follow-up rate in the entire cohort, 501 patients will be included in the&#xD;
      cohort. Retrospective data are available for all 557 patients. Reoperation, use of PPI and&#xD;
      mortality will be extracted from registries yielding 100% follow-up under the assumption that&#xD;
      no patient emigrated since surgery.&#xD;
