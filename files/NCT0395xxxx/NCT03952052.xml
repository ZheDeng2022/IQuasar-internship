  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Waldenström's disease (WM) is a rare, low-grade lymphoid hematopathy, accounting for 1 to 2%&#xD;
      of malignant hematopathies and mainly affecting the elderly. This disease is characterized by&#xD;
      lymphoplasmocyte cells infiltration into the bone marrow and by the production of a&#xD;
      monoclonal IgM protein in the serum. This disease is accompanied by clinical manifestations&#xD;
      of hepato-splenomegaly, signs of hyperviscosity, peripheral neuropathies and biological signs&#xD;
      with the presence of cytopenias and cryoglobulinemia. Some forms present node or splenic&#xD;
      involvement. While the asymptomatic form maintains overall survival close to that of the&#xD;
      healthy subject, the symptomatic form is subject to frequent relapses and remains incurable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current recommendations for the diagnosis and monitoring of this disease are based on protein&#xD;
      electrophoresis from a blood sample to quantify monoclonal IgM production and a myelogram or&#xD;
      bone marrow biopsy showing medullary infiltration by lymphoplasmocytic cells. However,&#xD;
      protein electrophoresis is an imprecise examination since it does not quantify tumour B&#xD;
      lymphocytes and has limitations, particularly in the case of poorly secreting forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More than 90% of Waldenström cases have the L265P mutation of the MYD88 gene. Although this&#xD;
      mutation is not found only in these diseases, it can help in the diagnosis. Other mutations&#xD;
      are also present in this pathology. These mutations can define prognostic factors or possibly&#xD;
      make it possible to identify therapeutic targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of new technologies makes it possible, on the one hand, to follow the L265P&#xD;
      mutation of MYD88 over time as a marker of response to treatment and, on the other hand, to&#xD;
      define these prognostic markers or therapeutic targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will first determine the best method for monitoring the mutation of MYD88. In a&#xD;
      second step, the investigators will evaluate the best type of sampling and in particular&#xD;
      whether this mutation is present in the blood in order to limit the invasive procedures such&#xD;
      as bone marrow sampling can be limited. Finally, the investigators will evaluate the&#xD;
      prognostic&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The L265P mutation of MYD88 appears as an early oncogenic event in the occurrence of&#xD;
      Waldenström disease and may already be present at the Monoclonal Gammapathy of Undetermined&#xD;
      Signification (MGUS) to IgM stage suggesting a continuum between the two stages of the&#xD;
      disease. The determination of IgM as a marker of the disease has limits since it does not&#xD;
      allow direct quantification of the clonal population and is taken failing this in the case of&#xD;
      poorly secreting forms. Monitoring the L265P mutation of MYD88 as a marker of minimal&#xD;
      residual disease therefore appears to be a biomarker of major interest in these diseases. The&#xD;
      kinetics of this marker particularly during treatment could allow to modify the therapeutic&#xD;
      management of patients at an early stage and to assess the risk of resistance to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several published studies show the interest of monitoring the L265P mutation of MYD88 in MW&#xD;
      in particular by quantification of the mutation by allele-specific PCR. The detection limit&#xD;
      studied was 0.1%. The recent development of new techniques and in particular digital PCR&#xD;
      makes it possible to obtain lower detection thresholds that could be more compatible with the&#xD;
      notion of minimal residual disease monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The originality of this study is based on the comparison of the quantification of the MYD88&#xD;
      L265P mutation in all affected biological compartments (blood, plasma, bone marrow or CD19+&#xD;
      cells) but especially in the monitoring of the mutation at two points of minimal residual&#xD;
      disease (mid-treatment and end of treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the parts of the project is the study of the allelic frequency of the L265P mutation&#xD;
      of the MYD88 gene in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). It has been shown in many pathologies and&#xD;
      in particular in other B lymphocytic hematologies such as Hodgkin's lymphoma or diffuse large&#xD;
      cell B lymphoma, that mutations present at the tumor level could be found in circulating&#xD;
      tumor DNA. Analysis of free tumor DNA circulating in patients' plasma can therefore be used&#xD;
      to characterize the disease at the molecular level with a less invasive sample than myelogram&#xD;
      or bone marrow biopsies. The search for other associated mutations also reinforces the&#xD;
      originality of the project. These combined data must be able to lead to changes in the&#xD;
      clinical management of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the allele frequency of the L265P mutation of MYD88 will be compared . by 3&#xD;
      different techniques: specific allele PCR, digital PCR and new generation sequencing. In this&#xD;
      way, investigators will evaluate the technique that has the best sensitivity and specificity&#xD;
      to be used as a marker for residual disease. These data will be compared to the reference&#xD;
      technique, protein electrophoresis. This evaluation will be conducted in total mononuclear&#xD;
      cells, DNAct, marrow and CD19+ sorted cells. Then, the investigators will follow the kinetics&#xD;
      of this mutation during the treatment at two points : mid-treatment and end of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Characterization of the mutation profile of these tumors allows prognostic factors to be&#xD;
      defined and may identify potential new therapeutic targets. This study will be realised by&#xD;
      new generation sequencing. Some of genes with mutations involved in treatment resistance will&#xD;
      be studied such as CXCR4. The mutations of CXCR4 are involved in the resistance to ibrutinib.&#xD;
      ARID1A mutations are also found in 20% of cases as well as TP53, KMT2D, CD79B, MYBBP1A&#xD;
      mutations.&#xD;
