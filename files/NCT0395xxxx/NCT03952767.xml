      This study assess the association between digital functional measures from physical&#xD;
      monitoring devices (devices like a watch tracking steps, a heart rate monitor) and&#xD;
      patient-reported standard oncological assessments. The study will also test the feasibility&#xD;
      of obtaining the measures in clinic and at home from the monitoring devices in participants&#xD;
      with cancer. Participants will be asked to spend 1 hour in clinic performing simple tasks&#xD;
      such as walking and standing with 7 digital devices recording movement data. The participants&#xD;
      will also be asked to fill out survey data regarding their health. At-home data will be&#xD;
      collected for 14 days. During this time participants will wear a watch to collect movement&#xD;
      and step data, and a lumbar belt to collect movement data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Assess the association of 5 main digital physical functional measures (mean steps per day,&#xD;
      mean sedentary activity time, light activity time, moderate activity time, and vigorous&#xD;
      activity time (in minutes) per day) recorded at home with patient-reported standard&#xD;
      oncological assessment (e.g. KPS)&#xD;
