  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most patients presenting to hospital with symptoms of a heart attack are sent home without&#xD;
      further tests once a heart attack has been ruled out. Current strategies to assess patients&#xD;
      with a suspected heart attack involve blood tests to measure troponin, a protein released&#xD;
      into the bloodstream when the heart muscle is damaged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite having had a heart attack ruled-out, some patients have unrecognised heart disease&#xD;
      and are at risk of having a heart attack in the future. However, clinicians do not know what&#xD;
      is the best approach to identify and treat these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will use a heart scan known as computed tomography coronary angiogram (CTCA) to&#xD;
      look for unrecognised heart disease in patients who have had a heart attack ruled out. In an&#xD;
      earlier study, the Investigators performed this scan in patients referred to the outpatient&#xD;
      cardiology clinic with stable chest pain and found that this improved the diagnosis of heart&#xD;
      disease, leading to improvement in patient care that prevented future heart attacks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous research from the Investigators has also found that troponin levels below those used&#xD;
      to diagnose a heart attack may help to identify those who are at greater risk of having a&#xD;
      heart attack in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to find out if patients with these low levels of troponin, where a&#xD;
      heart attack has been ruled out, will benefit from CTCA to look for unrecognised coronary&#xD;
      heart disease.&#xD;
