    <textblock>
      This trial will study SGN-CD47M to find out whether it is an effective treatment for&#xD;
      different types of solid tumors and what side effects (unwanted effects) may occur. The study&#xD;
      will have two parts. Part A of the study will find out how much SGN-CD47M should be given for&#xD;
      treatment and how often. Part B of the study will use the dose found in Part A and look at&#xD;
      how safe and effective the treatment is.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a dose-escalation study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK), and antitumor activity of SGN-CD47M in adults with advanced solid&#xD;
      tumors. The study will be conducted in 2 parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A - Dose escalation: Up to approximately 25 patients will be treated to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, and PK of SGN-CD47M, and to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)&#xD;
      and/or optimal dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B - Dose expansion: Up to approximately 180 patients will be treated in expansion&#xD;
      cohorts at the MTD or optimal dose to further characterize the safety, PK, and antitumor&#xD;
      activity of SGN-CD47M.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In eligible patients, standard therapies must have failed, been intolerable, or been&#xD;
      considered medically inappropriate by the investigator. If the MTD is not reached in Part A,&#xD;
      safety, PK, pharmacodynamic, and biomarker analyses, as well as preliminary antitumor&#xD;
      activity, will be used to determine the optimal dose. Patients in Part A may continue on&#xD;
      treatment until confirmed progressive disease (PD) or unacceptable toxicity, whichever occurs&#xD;
      first. The dose(s) to be examined in Part B will be at or below the MTD and/or the optimal&#xD;
      dose determined in Part A.&#xD;
