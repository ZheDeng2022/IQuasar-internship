      Ambroxol hydrochloride, an over-the-counter antitussive available in many markets , was&#xD;
      identified as an interesting pharmacological chaperone. In addition to a mucolytic action,&#xD;
      ambroxol has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Importantly, ambroxol therapy was&#xD;
      found safe when given to pregnant women for prevention of neonatal respiratory distress&#xD;
      syndrome .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, ambroxol, an oral available drug on the market, may be a safe option for GD patients&#xD;
      with potential disease-specific efficacy and should be expanded into a clinical trial using&#xD;
      higher doses and placebo-controlled design. The investigators propose to start with a phase&#xD;
      II study for patients with type 1 GD and suboptimal response to ERT. In addition the&#xD;
      investigators plan to open an international registry of patients with GD currently receiving&#xD;
      ambroxol (off study).&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the Problem:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) makes a significant impact on the clinical manifestations&#xD;
      and quality of life of patients with Gaucher disease (GD) . The goals of therapy focus mainly&#xD;
      on platelets, hemoglobin, spleen, liver, bones and growth parameters for children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ERT is mostly effective in patients with type 1 GD; still some patients don't achieve&#xD;
      normalization or near normalization of the therapeutic targets . Glucosylsphingosine&#xD;
      (LysoGb1) is the most specific and sensitive, and hence is probably the best currently&#xD;
      available GD biomarker. A level of LysoGB1 &lt; 140 ng/ml is considered a marker for controlled&#xD;
      GD (personal communication).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with GD may also experience chronic fatigue that causes functional disability and&#xD;
      adversely affects quality of life . The fatigue severity scale (FSS) is a 9-item tool; each&#xD;
      item is scored on a scale from 1 to 7, with a mean score of 4 or higher considered to&#xD;
      represent significant fatigue . Patients with GD have improvements in fatigue within 6 months&#xD;
      of starting ERT, and that it may be among the first symptoms to show significant improvement.&#xD;
      Using the FSS, no association was identified between fatigue and time on ERT (P = 0.57). In a&#xD;
      survey of patients with Type 1 GD and physicians, patients ascribed greater importance to&#xD;
      fatigue than other disease parameters, while physicians placed more emphasis on objective&#xD;
      measures of visceral and hematologic disease manifestations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Pharmacological chaperones:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The underlying pathology in GD is not only due to the lysosomal accumulation of&#xD;
      glucosylceramide in the tissue macrophages. There is a broader spectrum of lysosomal&#xD;
      dysfunction and various intracellular and molecular changes that could lead to additional&#xD;
      disease manifestations that are not affected by ERT. In particular, the retention of the&#xD;
      mutant glucocerebrosidase within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) which causes ER stress,&#xD;
      unfolding protein response (UPR) and early ER associated degradation (ERAD) . These ER&#xD;
      related changes are the rationale behind the use of pharmacological chaperones which are&#xD;
      capable of partially removing the misfolded proteins from the ER, thereby relieving ER&#xD;
      stress, avoiding ERAD and preventing consequent complications . Pharmacological chaperones&#xD;
      increase glucocerebrosidase activity by stabilizing the enzyme in the lysosome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. The Therapy to be Examined:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ambroxol hydrochloride, an over-the-counter antitussive available in many markets, was&#xD;
      identified as an interesting pharmacological chaperone. In addition to a mucolytic action,&#xD;
      ambroxol has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties . Importantly, ambroxol therapy was&#xD;
      found safe when given to pregnant women for prevention of neonatal respiratory distress&#xD;
      syndrome. In skin fibroblasts derived from Type 1 and Type 2 GD patients, ambroxol increases&#xD;
      both the lysosomal fraction and the enzymatic activity of several mutant glucocerebrosidase&#xD;
      variants with low toxicity . Incubation of human induced pluripotent stem cell macrophages&#xD;
      from patients with type I-III GD with ambroxol corrected the abnormal phenotypes of GD&#xD;
      macrophages. Ambroxol, has a small molecule chaperone, has been shown in healthy nonhuman&#xD;
      primates to cross the blood-brain barrier, and increase brain glucocerebrosidase activity .&#xD;
      In Drosophila neuropathic model, ambroxol was show to alleviate the neuronopathic phenotype&#xD;
      through reducing ER stress ].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have performed a pilot study to test the tolerability and efficacy of&#xD;
      ambroxol as a pharmacological chaperone in patients with symptomatic, type 1 GD who present&#xD;
      with measurable disease parameters but are not receiving ERT in order to provide proof of&#xD;
      concept and/or ascertain the suitability of ambroxol for a larger clinical trial [29] . The&#xD;
      Israeli Ministry of Health Form 29c was employed to prescribe ambroxol for off-label use.&#xD;
      Twelve patients were dispensed 2 capsules of 75 mg of ambroxol daily for 6 months. One&#xD;
      patient withdrew because of a hypersensitivity reaction, one because of elective splenectomy.&#xD;
      No patient experienced clinically relevant deterioration in disease parameters measured. One&#xD;
      patient achieved a robust response relative to baseline: +16.2% hemoglobin; +32.9% platelets;&#xD;
      -2.8% liver volume; and -14.4% spleen volume. Three patients elected to continue on ambroxol&#xD;
      for a further 6 months: hemoglobin levels and liver volumes were relatively stable, but&#xD;
      platelet counts further increased in the above patient (+52.6% from baseline) and spleen&#xD;
      volumes decreased further in all three patients (-6.4%, -18.6%, and -23.4% from baseline) .&#xD;
      More recently, a pilot study of ambroxol was done in five patients with neuronopathic GD in&#xD;
      combination with enzyme replacement therapy [30]. High-dose oral Ambroxol had good safety and&#xD;
      tolerability with clinical and laboratory signs of activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, ambroxol, an oral available drug on the market, may be a safe option for GD patients&#xD;
      with potential disease-specific efficacy and should be expanded into a clinical trial using&#xD;
      higher doses and placebo-controlled design [31]. The investigators propose to start with a&#xD;
      phase II study for patients with type 1 GD and suboptimal response to ERT. In addition the&#xD;
      investigators plan to open an international registry of patients with GD currently receiving&#xD;
      ambroxol (off study).&#xD;
