  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, cross-over (placebo or elafibranor [GFT505])&#xD;
      placebo-controlled study, will evaluate the effect on hepatic lipid composition and safety of&#xD;
      elafibranor 120 mg quaque die (QD) versus placebo in an adult NAFL population after 6 weeks&#xD;
      of treatment with a 4-week wash-out period. This study will achieve mechanistic information&#xD;
      about the mode of action of Elafibranor on the (lipid) metabolism in the human fatty liver&#xD;
