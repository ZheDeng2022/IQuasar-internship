        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Healthy adult male or female volunteers ages 18 or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status 1, 2 or 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Able to provide informed consent, adhere to the study schedule, and complete all study&#xD;
             assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Body Mass Index ≥18 and ≤40 kg/m2&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Allergy, hypersensitivity, intolerance, or contraindication to any of the study&#xD;
             medications for which an alternative is not named in the protocol (eg, amide-type&#xD;
             local anesthetics, opioids, bupivacaine, NSAIDs)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Documented history of long-term diabetes, renal (serum creatinine level &gt;2mg/dL [176.8&#xD;
             μmol/L]) or hepatic dysfunction (serum alanine or aspartame transferase &gt; 3 times the&#xD;
             upper limit of normal), coagulation or bleeding disorder and severe peripheral&#xD;
             vascular disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Concurrent painful physical condition that may require analgesic treatment (such as&#xD;
             long-term, consistent use of opioids) in the post dosing period for pain and which, in&#xD;
             the investigator's opinion may confound the post dosing assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. History of, suspected, or known addiction to or abuse of illicit drug(s), prescription&#xD;
             medicine(s), or alcohol within the past 2 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Administration of an investigational drug within 30 days or 5 elimination half-lives&#xD;
             of such investigational drug, whichever is longer, prior to study drug administration,&#xD;
             or planned administration of another investigational product or procedure during the&#xD;
             subject's participation in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Previous participation in EXPAREL study&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Uncontrolled anxiety, schizophrenia, or other psychiatric disorder that, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the investigator, could interfere with study assessments or compliance&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Currently pregnant, nursing, or planning to become pregnant during the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Clinically significant medical disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, would&#xD;
             make participation in a clinical study inappropriate. This includes any psychiatric or&#xD;
             other conditions that would constitute a contraindication to participation in the&#xD;
             study&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Currently on neuroleptic agent [e.g., gabapentin, pregabalin (Lyrica), duloxetine&#xD;
             (Cymbalta) etc.]&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Inadequate sensory function on the foot (monofilament test)&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Chronic opioid use in the last 30 days (≥30 morphine equivalents/ day)&#xD;
&#xD;
             In addition, the subject may be withdrawn from the study if the subject meets the&#xD;
             following criterion during or post-surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Any clinically significant event or condition uncovered during the surgery (e.g.,&#xD;
             excessive bleeding, acute sepsis) that, in the opinion of the investigator, renders&#xD;
             the subject medically unstable or complicates the subject's post-operative course&#xD;
