      The ESCAPE-PD (Effects of add-on SpironolaCtone to losartan versus Alone on Peritoneal&#xD;
      mEmbrane among continuous ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis patients) study is a randomized,&#xD;
      open-label, single center, active-controlled clinical trial. Adults end-stage kidney disease&#xD;
      patients 18 years or older undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) will&#xD;
      be enrolled. A total 84 CAPD will be randomly assigned to either the combination of&#xD;
      spironolactone and losartan (experimental arm) or losartan alone (control arm). The primary&#xD;
      outcomes are the difference in peritoneal dialysate effluent cancer antigen-125 (CA-125) and&#xD;
      peritoneal equilibration test (PET) indices (dialysate-to-plasma creatinine ratio, 4-hour&#xD;
      ultrafiltration volume, and the concentration of glucose present in the solution at the start&#xD;
      of the test). Secondary outcome measures include laboratory and mechanistic outcome measures,&#xD;
      nutrition outcomes, health-related quality of life, physical function, clinical events, and&#xD;
      safety profiles. Results will be disseminated to suggest a strategy to prevent the peritoneal&#xD;
      membrane function among CAPD patients through peer-reviewed publications along with&#xD;
      scientific meetings.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is one of the methods of renal replacement therapy (RRT) that can&#xD;
      easily perform at home. The declared &quot;PD first&quot; policy from the National Health Security&#xD;
      Office causes rapidly expansion of this group of patients. In the year 2013, the current&#xD;
      study in Thailand showed that the patients enrolled for peritoneal dialysis accumulated for&#xD;
      more than 15,000 people. It works continuously similar to the actual function of the kidneys&#xD;
      in normal people. In addition, PD also helps to slow the decline of remaining kidney function&#xD;
      (residual renal function), which is very important and affect in decreasing mortality rate in&#xD;
      this group of patients. However, PD has several limitations such as complications from the&#xD;
      infection and high failure rate associated with a dysfunction of the peritoneal membrane&#xD;
      during long-term treatment. Approximately 4-12 percent of patients will have ultrafiltration&#xD;
      failure and volume overload in the first couple of years of treatment and soar to 30-50&#xD;
      percent in patients treated for more than six years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The causes of peritoneal membrane deterioration are exposure to incompatible dialysis&#xD;
      solution with hyperosmolar glucose content, acidic pH, reactions to PD catheter material,&#xD;
      uremia and peritonitis. The alterations of structural and functional of the peritoneal&#xD;
      membrane after exposed to these several insults are epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition&#xD;
      (EMT), and increase in peritoneal solute transport, which consequently leading to peritoneal&#xD;
      dialysis failure. It has been already demonstrated that the local&#xD;
      renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a key role in this regulation by promoting&#xD;
      the activation of neoangiogenesis and fibrotic pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the pathophysiologic changes of the peritoneal membrane, Angiotensin Converting&#xD;
      Enzyme Inhibitors (ACEIs) and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs) are adapted to be use in&#xD;
      respect of membrane preserving agents. Many studies, both in human and animal models,&#xD;
      demonstrate the protective effect against peritoneal membrane deterioration by inhibiting the&#xD;
      formation of transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-β1), vascular endothelial growth factor&#xD;
      (VEGF), and decreasing progression rate of small to high transport membrane type. In fact,&#xD;
      mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) seem to have higher efficacy than ACEIs/ARBs in&#xD;
      some experimental models. The possible mechanism is the effects of mineralocorticoid receptor&#xD;
      antagonists that not only inhibit the formation of TGF- β1 and VEGF, but also suppress&#xD;
      intracellular Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) generation, activation of extracellular&#xD;
      signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), the&#xD;
      substrates responsible for aldosterone induces alterations in cell phenotype. A prospective&#xD;
      cohort study of 23 CAPD patients was conducted and evaluated the effect of spironolactone on&#xD;
      peritoneal membrane. The result showed the possible benefit of spironolactone in slowing the&#xD;
      decline of peritoneal function, suppressing the elevation of profibrotic markers, and&#xD;
      increasing mesothelial cell mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result of the clinical practice, most of CAPD patients tend to receive ACEIs/ARBs as&#xD;
      prescribe by the clinicians, in order to control blood pressure, raise serum potassium level,&#xD;
      and others compelling indications. Thus, the concept of add-on MRAs to ACEIs/ARBs, desiring&#xD;
      the synergistic effects of these 2 drugs group, for membrane preservation is challenge.&#xD;
      Notwithstanding the fact that current evidence about the combination effects of ACEIs/ARBs&#xD;
      with MRAs is limited in term of quality of the study, sample size, inadequate follow-up&#xD;
      period, and poor sensitive parameter in assessing the structural and functional changes of&#xD;
      the peritoneal membrane. Thereby, this study aims to evaluate the effect of add-on&#xD;
      spironolactone to losartan versus losartan alone on membrane preservation in continuous&#xD;
      ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients.&#xD;
