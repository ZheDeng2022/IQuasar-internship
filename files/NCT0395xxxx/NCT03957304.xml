  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The most common injury prompting an emergency department (ED) visit in children is a cut&#xD;
      (laceration) that requires repair using stitches or skin glue. Despite anesthetic (freezing),&#xD;
      laceration repair is often very distressful because in young children, most occur on the&#xD;
      face. There is currently no effective drug to relieve the distress of laceration repair in&#xD;
      children. The goal is to find a safe and effective drug to reduce distress in children&#xD;
      undergoing laceration repair. Dexmedetomidine is a new drug that safely provides mild&#xD;
      sedation and can be given as a painless nasal spray. Intranasal dexmedetomidine (IND) has&#xD;
      been shown to reduce distress in children undergoing painful procedures such as dental work&#xD;
      and intravenous insertion. However, no large study has explored IND for laceration repair. In&#xD;
      order for research to change the way we care for children, a large study that enrolls&#xD;
      children across many paediatric EDs needs to be performed. The first step is to conduct a&#xD;
      smaller study to identify the safest and most effective dose. The proposed study plans to&#xD;
      enroll 55 children age 1-10 years who require laceration repair.&#xD;

      Design: This study will be designed as a phase II single-arm dose-escalation pilot study&#xD;
      using the continual reassessment method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol: Sedation will be measured using the Pediatric Sedation State Scale (PSSS), an&#xD;
      instrument validated for video scoring of children undergoing painful procedures. The PSSS is&#xD;
      scored from 0 (dangerously sedated) to 5 (least sedated) easily by non-medical personnel and&#xD;
      assesses over sedation and under sedation. Adequate sedation is a score of 2 or 3.&#xD;
      Participants will be consecutively assigned to increasing doses of IND from 1-4 mcg/kg based&#xD;
      on the continual reassessment method. Participants will be assigned to doses of IND from 1-4&#xD;
      mcg/kg, increasing in whole number increments. Initially three participants will receive&#xD;
      1mcg/kg and the number of participants at each dose of IND will be recorded. Data from these&#xD;
      participants will be used to update a Bayesian model for the dose-response curve for all&#xD;
      three categories of sedation. The following three participants will be assigned the dose with&#xD;
      the highest posterior probability of an efficacy close to 0.8. This balances the need to&#xD;
      determine the most efficacious dose but prevents an excessive number of over-sedations. For&#xD;
      the Bayesian dose response model, a determination will be made as to the overall score&#xD;
      category for each participant (&quot;adequate&quot;, &quot;over&quot;, or &quot;under sedated&quot; based on the PSSS). To&#xD;
      be scored as &quot;adequate&quot;, a participant must have a PSSS score of 2 or 3 for at least 90% of&#xD;
      observations from initial positioning to tying of the last suture. If a participant does not&#xD;
      retain a PSSS score of 2 or 3 for at least 90% of the observations, they will be categorized&#xD;
      as either over or under-sedated, if the majority of the remaining PSSS scores are 0 or 1 or 4&#xD;
      or 5, respectively. Furthermore, if the participant remains awake, but not distressed during&#xD;
      the procedure, they will be scored as a 2 based on the PSSS. However, for the purposes of the&#xD;
      Bayesian dose response model, they will be scored as &quot;under sedated&quot; to avoid concluding that&#xD;
      a lower dose of IND is effective based on the outcomes for participants that did not require&#xD;
      sedation. Finally, participants who are noncompliant with IND will be categorized as an&#xD;
      over-sedation as it is assumed that this dose was not well tolerated by the participant and&#xD;
      dose escalation should be avoided. Data will be reviewed after each dose increment by a data&#xD;
      safety monitoring board, who will confirm it is safe to escalate. Permissible&#xD;
      co-interventions include topical and subcutaneous anesthetic, oral or IV analgesics,&#xD;
      non-pharmacologic strategies for pain and distress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening and Enrollment: Participants will be consecutively screened for eligibility during&#xD;
      the hours of study recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: This was calculated using the Bayesian continual reassessment method (20). Based&#xD;
      on an adverse event rate of 10%, 4 dosing levels, an odds ratio for the effect size of 1.8,&#xD;
      and a phase II trial accuracy level of 60%, an estimated a sample size of 55 participants was&#xD;
      calculated.&#xD;
