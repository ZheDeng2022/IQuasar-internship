  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postprandial lipemia produced by fat intake is a major risk factor for the development of&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases (CVD), the most important cause of disease and death in the Western&#xD;
      world. Scientific evidence shows that the consumption of saturated fatty acids has a&#xD;
      potential harmful effect on postprandial lipemia compared to the intake of monounsaturated&#xD;
      fatty acids. The magnitude of postprandial lipemia is also determined by the health status of&#xD;
      individuals, being altered in individuals with metabolic disorders associated with the&#xD;
      development of CVD, such as hypertriglyceridemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Palm oil is widely used in bakery products because it is more economical compared to other&#xD;
      fats and oils of other origin and for its stability properties that contribute to this type&#xD;
      of food. This oil has a profile of fatty acids, rich in saturated fatty acids, mainly&#xD;
      palmitic acid, which as mentioned above, is associated with health alterations. In addition,&#xD;
      the investigators must add the environmental problems that are generated by the massive&#xD;
      cultivation of the plant from which palm oil is extracted (oil palm Elaeis guineensis),&#xD;
      including the loss of thousands of hectares of tropical forest and endangering to dozens of&#xD;
      animal species from deforested areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proliferation of all these arguments associated with the effect on the health and&#xD;
      environment of the consumption of palm oil has given way to a paradigm shift in the use of&#xD;
      palm oil in the food sector.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of the study is that consumption of bagels with a composition optimized in&#xD;
      fatty acids, eliminating the content of palm oil and replacing it with high oleic sunflower&#xD;
      oil and stearic acid completely hydrogenated without trans fatty acids, so that the same&#xD;
      amount of fat is maintained, will decrease the postprandial lipemia, compared to the&#xD;
      consumption of bagels with a more conventional composition in fatty acids, in healthy and /&#xD;
      or with mild-moderate hypertriglyceridemia individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of acute consumption of bagels&#xD;
      without palm oil in its formulation and with an optimized fatty acid composition on&#xD;
      postprandial lipemia measuring the evolution of plasma triglyceride levels in healthy and/or&#xD;
      with mild-moderated hypertriglyceridemia individuals.&#xD;
