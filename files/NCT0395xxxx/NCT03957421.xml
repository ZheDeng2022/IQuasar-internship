  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the impact of underwater vs. land based exercise and/or gait training on&#xD;
      functional mobility for patients with stroke.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Subjects will be recruited via convenience sampling from the Methodist University community&#xD;
      and local area. Additionally contacts from medical clinics may be contacted for recruitment&#xD;
      of participants. Once individuals have been identified, they will be informed of inclusion&#xD;
      and exclusion criteria to be assessed for appropriateness for the project. Informed consent&#xD;
      will be provided to participants prior to start.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria consists of having a stroke and being able to walk 20 meters without a&#xD;
      lower extremity orthotic. If participant's have significant fear of water, seizures,&#xD;
      incontinence with bowel or bladder, open wounds, infections such as UTI or fever,&#xD;
      tracheostomy, nasogastric or gastronomy tube, colostomy, uncontrolled hypertension, skin&#xD;
      rash, hard cast due to fracture, isolation precautions, IV or indwelling catheters,&#xD;
      uncontrolled agitation, require use of continuous supplemental oxygen, or allergies to&#xD;
      chemicals used in a pool, they will not be placed in the underwater groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic survey will be provided and filled out prior to the start of data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As physical therapy exercise is within the scope of Physical Therapy Practice and in the&#xD;
      state of North Carolina Physical Therapists have direct access to practice without a&#xD;
      physician clearance, participants will be assessed using baseline testing (please see below)&#xD;
      to ensure medical stability for participation in exercise. Furthermore, participants will be&#xD;
      asked if they have been cleared by a physician prior to beginning in exercise (please see&#xD;
      consent survey). If individuals evaluated by the supervising physical therapist are deemed to&#xD;
      need additional medical clearance from their physician, they will be asked to attain a note&#xD;
      from the physician stating they are clear to participate in exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline testing: Participants will complete a basic physical therapy examination consisting&#xD;
      of vitals assessment (heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, rate of perceived&#xD;
      exertion and respiratory rate), anthropometric measurements, posture, range of motion,&#xD;
      strength testing and use of the following outcome measures to assess self-perception of&#xD;
      stroke impact, balance and gait: 4-square step test (FSST), Timed Up and Go (TUG), Dynamic&#xD;
      Gait Index (DGI), Romberg, Sharpened Romberg and Single Limb Stance (SLS). Additionally, gait&#xD;
      characteristics will be measured using the GAITRite System.&#xD;
