    <textblock>
      Obesity among children is a major problem. Therefore, it is important to start promoting a&#xD;
      healthy lifestyle in an early stage. However, professionals find it difficult to start a&#xD;
      conversation about overweight and lifestyle. Within Centre for Overweight Adolescent and&#xD;
      Children's Healthcare (COACH) at the Maastricht University Medical Centre (MUMC+) a tool was&#xD;
      developed, based on motivational interviewing, to help professionals engage in conversation&#xD;
      with the children about weight and lifestyle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to identify barriers and facilitators perceived by professionals,&#xD;
      working with children, to start a conversation with a child with overweight or obesity about&#xD;
      weight and lifestyle. In addition, this study researches the effects of the developed COACH&#xD;
      Conversationstarter, a tool that can help healthcare professionals to start a conversation&#xD;
      with children about overweight and lifestyle and to gain more insight in the views, thoughts&#xD;
      and beliefs of the child and its family.&#xD;

      Overweight and obesity among children are major problems, not only in The Netherlands, but&#xD;
      globally. Childhood obesity is associated with an increased risk for the development of&#xD;
      different disease, like cardiovascular disease and sleep disorders, but it can also affect&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It's important to start promoting a healthy lifestyle among children and their parents in an&#xD;
      early stage. The use of effective communication and respect to the language used is very&#xD;
      important. However, international studies have shown that professionals experience barriers&#xD;
      in starting a conversation about overweight and lifestyle. Examples of barriers may be fear&#xD;
      of harm to the child, fear of parents' reactions and parents unmotivated to change. Knowledge&#xD;
      regarding possible barriers and facilitators experienced specifically by Dutch healthcare&#xD;
      professionals in talking about overweight is scarce.&#xD;
&#xD;
      National guidelines and the development of different visual tools (such as posters with&#xD;
      pictures of healthy portion sizes and sugar amounts in beverages) are provided as&#xD;
      facilitators in (visually) addressing lifestyle improvement by healthcare providers. However,&#xD;
      they mainly focus on giving advice about creating a healthy lifestyle, rather than engaging&#xD;
      in a conversation with children and parents about the current weight and lifestyle and&#xD;
      exploring their views. In other words: these tools are developed to directly address the&#xD;
      measures to be taken to change lifestyle, rather than discussing the status quo and exploring&#xD;
      the underlying motivation. Within Centre for Overweight Adolescent and Children's Healthcare&#xD;
      (COACH) at the Maastricht University Medical Centre (MUMC+) a tool was developed, based on&#xD;
      motivational interviewing, to help professionals engage in conversation with children with&#xD;
      overweight or obesity about weight and lifestyle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to identify barriers and facilitators perceived by healthcare&#xD;
      professionals to start a conversation with a child about weight and lifestyle. In addition,&#xD;
      this study researches the effects of the developed COACH Conversationstarter, a tool that can&#xD;
      help healthcare professionals to start a conversation with children about overweight and&#xD;
      lifestyle and to gain more insight in the views, thoughts and beliefs of the child and its&#xD;
      family.&#xD;

    <description>The studypopulation for this mixed-methods study is consisting of healthcareprofessionals working with children (with overweight or obesity), such as pediatric residents, paediatricians and youth health care professionals. Also other professionals working with children, not working in the field of healthcare, such as teachers, can be included in the study population.</description>

    <intervention_name>Training COACH Conversationstarter</intervention_name>
    <description>After elaborating perceived barriers and facilitators via surveys and semi-structured focusgroups, a short training with the COACH Conversationstarter will be provided to a part of the participants. The COACH Conversationstarter will be provided to the participants attending the training, which they can use in the next couple of months. After a period of time all participants will be provided with a second questionnaire, and results of the group that received the COACH Conversationstarter will be compared with the group that didn't receive the COACH Conversationstarter. (A part of) the participants that used the COACH Conversationstarter will be interviewed about their experiences.&#xD;
However, the study will have an observational design, since the decision if a professional is attending the training is not based on the investigator / protocol, but depending on the professional, for example logistic reasons. This is part of routine education.</description>
