  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) are central to understanding the impact of cancer&#xD;
      treatments on patients. Treatment may control cancer growth, and even sometimes modestly&#xD;
      improve the length of life, but at the expense of disruption of lifestyle, and of toxicities.&#xD;
      It is very important to use PROMs to evaluate the balance between these risks and benefits to&#xD;
      understand the overall impact of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It remains poorly described whether patients report improved outcomes during palliative&#xD;
      chemotherapy with trabectedin, using high quality questionnaires, and how this may vary with&#xD;
      the clinical effects and duration of the treatment and characteristics of the patient.&#xD;

      Trabectedin improves progression-free survival in un-resectable advanced soft tissue sarcoma,&#xD;
      in particular lipo- and leiomyo- sarcomas after failure of conventional chemotherapy, with a&#xD;
      low level of reported grade 3 symptomatic toxicity for many patients. However objective&#xD;
      responses are infrequent, with the largest proportion of patients who benefit using&#xD;
      traditional oncological response criteria having a delay in progression with the cancer&#xD;
      stable. Trabectedin may improve the duration of cancer control by the modulation of cancer&#xD;
      growth as measured by the growth modulation index (GMI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) are central to understanding the impact of cancer&#xD;
      therapies which may shrink cancers or control their growth, and even sometimes modestly&#xD;
      improve the length of life, but at the expense of disruption of lifestyle, and of toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is very important to use PROMs to evaluate the balance between these risks and benefits to&#xD;
      understand the overall impact of the therapy. It remains poorly described whether patients&#xD;
      report improved outcomes during palliative chemotherapy with trabectedin, using validated&#xD;
      questionnaires, and how this may vary with the clinical efficacy and duration of the&#xD;
      treatment and the demographic and clinical characteristics of the patient. Therefore the&#xD;
      investigators intend to examine the feasibility of collecting patient reported outcome&#xD;
      measures using validated instruments prospectively during English NHS administration of&#xD;
      Trabectedin and with this to explore the pattern of patient reported outcomes, such as is the&#xD;
      trajectory in PROMs distinct comparing groups by the size or symptoms from tumour masses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will aim deliver Patient Reported Outcomes Measures (PROMs) data in patients with&#xD;
      advanced tissue sarcoma. The recruitment target is a total of 30 patients over a 2 year&#xD;
      period. Patients' quality of life (QoL) will be captured using a validated QoL questionnaire&#xD;
      (EORTC QLQ-C30) during their treatment with Trabectedin. The questionnaire takes&#xD;
      approximately 12 minutes and the patient will complete this unaided. Patients will be&#xD;
      required to complete the electronic questionnaire using Q-Tool. Q-Tool is a web-based piece&#xD;
      of software. Patients will be required to complete this questionnaire alongside receiving&#xD;
      standard of care treatment with Trabectedin in the following pattern: On the day of&#xD;
      administration of the 1st of treatment with Trabectedin; before the 2nd treatment of&#xD;
      Trabectedin; before the 4th treatment of Trabectedin; prior to the 7th treatment of&#xD;
      Trabectedin; prior to the 10th treatment of Trabectedin and then will continue in 3 weekly&#xD;
      cycles until the end of treatment with Trabectedin. Patients will complete the questionnaire&#xD;
      on the computer terminals available in the outpatient clinic before they see the doctor and&#xD;
      nurses and prior to treatment on each of these days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients at the end of treatment with Trabectedin will complete a short exit questionnaire.&#xD;
      This will assess their experiences of completing the QoL questionnaire and ease of using&#xD;
      Q-Tool. The exit questionnaire will take approximately 5 minutes to complete. This will be&#xD;
      completed in the outpatient area and provided to the patient by the Research Nurse.&#xD;

    <description>As this is a pilot exploratory study the investigators will have multiple co-primary outcomes.The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ) is a 30 question assessment of quality of life in the following categories: global health status, physical functioning, role functioning, emotional functioning, cognitive functioning, social functioning, fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain, dyspnoea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhoea, and financial difficulties. Twenty-eight questions are assessed on a scale of 1 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much); 2 questions are assessed on a scale of 1 (very poor) to 7 (excellent). The range of scores on each scale is from 0 to 100. In the function scales, a score of 100 is best (indicating more function). In the symptom scores, a score of 100 is worst, indicating more symptoms. Scores are totalled from each item to form the scales, then normalised to 0-100.</description>
