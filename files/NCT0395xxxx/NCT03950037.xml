  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subarachnoid neurocysticercosis (SANCC) is a severe infection of the brain by the tapeworm&#xD;
      Taenia solium. People who have this infection are usually diagnosed late in the disease&#xD;
      process leading to very poor prognosis. This trial studies the safety of early medical&#xD;
      intervention in people who have SANCC but do not have symptoms. The trial will enroll 18&#xD;
      participants in Peru.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the risk of serious adverse events (SAE) related to intervention in&#xD;
      asymptomatic SANCC; these include drug-related side effects, moderate/severe intracranial&#xD;
      hypertension, hydrocephalus requiring shunting or endoscopy, stroke, status epilepticus, or&#xD;
      unexplained death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be hospitalized for approximately 15-30 days while they receive treatment&#xD;
      with the antiparasitic drug albendazole, as well as additional drugs (dexmathesaone and&#xD;
      omeprazole) to address potential treatment complications. Participants will have continuous&#xD;
      monitoring for adverse events while in the hospital. After participants are released to home,&#xD;
      they will monitored for adverse events for an additional 12 months through home visits,&#xD;
      telephone contact, and monthly clinical evaluations with serologic and radiologic assessment.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female individuals older than two years with a diagnosis of asymptomatic SANCC&#xD;
             confirmed by MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  SANCC limited to the basal cisterns, the interhemispheric brain space, brain fissures&#xD;
             or spine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Baseline laboratory results within acceptable ranges (specifically defined in the&#xD;
             study protocol)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness to accomplish the two-week minimum hospitalization required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals who only have subarachnoid lesions in the convexity of the brain&#xD;
             hemispheres will not be included because these lesions commonly respond well to&#xD;
             therapy and behave as intraparenchymal lesions&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Co-occurrence of a) more than 20 intraparenchymal lesions in addition to their&#xD;
             subarachnoid disease, or b) intraparenchymal lesions greater than 3.0 cm of diameter&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals for whom a surgical intervention to treat their subarachnoid disease is&#xD;
             considered clearly superior to a medical intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previously diagnosis or treatment for cysticercosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active pulmonary tuberculosis evidenced by chest X-ray and positive sputum smears, or&#xD;
             symptoms compatible with tuberculosis (fever+sweats or fever+cough) not otherwise&#xD;
             explained&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals with positive markers for active hepatitis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other systemic disease that may affect therapy or short-term prognosis, including but&#xD;
             not limited to chronic renal failure, hepatic insufficiency, cardiac failure, or&#xD;
             steroid-dependent immune diseases&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy. If a participant becomes pregnant during the study, she will continue in&#xD;
             the study but will have radiological exams delayed until after delivery&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of hypersensitivity to ABZ&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic alcohol or drug abuse as defined in the study protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unwilling or unable to provide MRI exams (e.g. patients with ferromagnetic implants)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability or unwillingness of subject or legal representative to give written informed&#xD;
             consent.&#xD;
