  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The heavy disease burden is mainly due to diabetic complications. Diabetes is a major risk&#xD;
      factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD).China has been the&#xD;
      largest absolute disease burden of diabetes in the world recently1. Diabetic patients with&#xD;
      established CVD or CKD are bringing growing pressure upon our nation's healthcare&#xD;
      expenditure1. However, the characteristic profile of Chinese diabetic patients who has CVD,&#xD;
      CKD or at high risk of CVD remains unclear thus is in urgent need for in-depth&#xD;
      investigation.In current China, however, the information regarding diabetes or non-diabetes&#xD;
      patients who also had other comorbid conditions (e.g. established CV diseases, CKD or at high&#xD;
      risk for such problem), is limited; the patient characteristics, treatment patterns and&#xD;
      economic burden may not be fully understood.Therefore, based on TianJin regional database,&#xD;
      the investigators will describe the demographic, clinical characteristics, treatment, and&#xD;
      economic burden of disease of Chinese diabetic/non-diabetic patients with/without established&#xD;
      CV disease, CKD, or at high CV risk including hypertension and hyperlipidaemia. And the&#xD;
      investigators believe that the resulting findings will inform a comprehensive group of&#xD;
      evidence users to achieve better healthcare for diabetes patients with established or at high&#xD;
      risk of CVD or CKD.&#xD;

      The study aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics, treatment, and economic burden&#xD;
      of disease of Chinese diabetic/non-diabetic patients with/without established cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease, chronic kidney disease, or at high cardiovascular risk, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. estimate the proportion of Chinese diabetic/non-diabetic patients with established&#xD;
           cardiovascular disease, CKD, or at high cardiovascular risk including hypertension and&#xD;
           hyperlipidaemia;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of Chinese diabetic/non-diabetic&#xD;
           patients with/without established cardiovascular disease, CKD, or at high cardiovascular&#xD;
           risk;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. investigate the treatment patterns of Chinese diabetic/non-diabetic patients&#xD;
           with/without established cardiovascular disease, CKD, or at high cardiovascular risk;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. examine economic burden of disease of Chinese diabetic/non-diabetic patients&#xD;
           with/without established cardiovascular disease, CKD, or at high cardiovascular risk;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. explore the trends of clinical characteristics, treatment pattern, economic burden of&#xD;
           inpatients over time (2008, 2013, and 2018 separately);&#xD;
