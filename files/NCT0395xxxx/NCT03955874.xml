  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: The requirement for ventilator support is a defining feature of critical illness.&#xD;
      Weaning is the process during which the work of breathing is transferred from the ventilator&#xD;
      back to the patient. Approximately 40% of the total time spent on ventilators is dedicated to&#xD;
      weaning. The extent of practice variation in how this complex and expensive technology is&#xD;
      discontinued from critically ill patients is unknown. Meanwhile, practice variation has been&#xD;
      shown to adversely impact upon patient safety and clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: To characterize practice pattern variation in weaning and the consequences of&#xD;
      weaning variation by implementing an international, prospective observational study in&#xD;
      Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, Europe, India and Australia/New Zealand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives: To describe&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. weaning practice variation among regions in 5 domains (the use of daily screening,&#xD;
           preferred methods of support used before initial discontinuation attempts, use of&#xD;
           written protocols, preferred methods of evaluating spontaneous breathing, and sedation&#xD;
           and mobilization practices).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the assocation between selected discontinuation strategies and important clinical&#xD;
           outcomes (length of stay, mortality, duration of ventilation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The investigators propose to conduct a large scale, observational study involving&#xD;
      critically ill adults requiring ventilator support for at least 24 hours to evaluate&#xD;
      practices in discontinuing ventilators in 150 centres. The investigators will classify each&#xD;
      new admission over the observation period according to the initial strategy that precipitated&#xD;
      or facilitated ventilator discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance: This novel study will build collaborations with critical care investigators from&#xD;
      around the world and industry&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background: The requirement for mechanical ventilation is a defining feature of critical&#xD;
      illness. Weaning is the process during which the work of breathing is transferred from the&#xD;
      ventilator back to the patient. Approximately 40% of the total time spent on mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation is dedicated to weaning. The extent and predictors of practice variation in how&#xD;
      this complicated and expensive technology is discontinued from critically ill patients&#xD;
      remains unknown. Meanwhile, practice pattern variability has been shown to adversely impact&#xD;
      upon patient safety and important clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To describe weaning practice variation with regard to the (i) use of daily screening,&#xD;
           (ii) preferred methods of support used before initial discontinuation attempts, (iii)&#xD;
           use of written weaning and spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) protocols, (iv) preferred&#xD;
           methods used to conduct SBTs and (v) sedation and mobilization practices among&#xD;
           geographic regions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To describe the association between variation in weaning practices (direct extubation,&#xD;
           tracheostomy, SBT conduct) and important clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To identify baseline and time-dependent factors associated with use of selected&#xD;
           strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Among critically ill adults who undergo an initial SBT, the investigators will: a)&#xD;
           investigate associations between SBT outcome (success/failure) and clinical outcomes, b)&#xD;
           explore differences between critically ill patients who undergo an SBT early versus&#xD;
           later in their intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and c) investigate the impact of&#xD;
           different SBT techniques and humidification strategies on outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To identify important predictors (patient, clinician, SBT, institutional and regional)&#xD;
           of SBT outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design and Population: The investigators propose to conduct an international&#xD;
      prospective observational study of mechanical ventilation discontinuation practices in 150&#xD;
      ICUs involving all newly admitted critically ill adults requiring invasive ventilation for at&#xD;
      least 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Centres: Interested centres have been identified through completion of an information&#xD;
      card enclosed in a previously administered International Weaning Survey. The investigators&#xD;
      will use a multimodal approach to identify participating centers in each of the 6 geographic&#xD;
      regions (Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, Europe, India and Australia/New&#xD;
      Zealand).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Outcomes: The investigators will classify each new admission over the study week&#xD;
      according to the initial strategy that precipitated or facilitated mechanical ventilation&#xD;
      discontinuation into one of five categories: direct extubation, tracheostomy, SBT success,&#xD;
      SBT failure or death. The investigator will describe the association between the use of&#xD;
      alternative discontinuation strategies and important clinical outcomes (e.g., mortality, ICU&#xD;
      and hospital stay, ICU readmission and reintubation rates).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance: Through collaborations with industry partners and international colleagues we will&#xD;
      implement this large scale observational study to quantify the existence and extent of&#xD;
      practice variation in weaning. Information obtained from this study will inform the design of&#xD;
      future studies aimed at reducing weaning practice variation and improving outcomes in&#xD;
      critically ill patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation&#xD;

        We propose to conduct an International, Prospective Observational Study of Mechanical&#xD;
        Ventilation Discontinuation Practices among critically ill adults who receive invasive&#xD;
        mechanical ventilation for at least 24 (i.e., &gt; or equal to 24) hours in approximately 150&#xD;
        international ICUs&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All newly admitted critically ill adults after study initiation at participating ICUs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Requiring invasive mechanical ventilation for at least 24 (i.e. &gt; or equal to 24)&#xD;
             hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Transferred to a participating ICU without a clear time of intubation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tracheotomy/tracheostomy present at the time of ICU admission&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Already on ventilator settings compatible with a SBT [e.g., T-piece or Continuous&#xD;
             Positive Airway Pressure &lt; or =5 cm H2O (water) or Pressure Support &lt; or = 8 cm H2O&#xD;
             (with or without PEEP) or Automatic Tube Compensation (ATC) or equivalent] at the time&#xD;
             of ICU admission&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient residing in ICU for &gt; or = 24 hours at the time of the study activation (i.e.,&#xD;
             not a new admission from the time of study activation).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient readmitted to this ICU during the study period (i.e., would constitute a&#xD;
             second inclusion) unless they were ineligible during their first admission&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients participating in studies (e.g., randomized controlled trials) with explicit&#xD;
             weaning protocols incorporated into the study design&#xD;
