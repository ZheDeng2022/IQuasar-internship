  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with suspicious breast lesion (BIRADS category 4/5) who are scheduled to undergo&#xD;
      biopsy will be recruited to undergo imaging evaluation with Contrast Enhanced Dual Energy&#xD;
      Mammography (CEDM), Contrast Enhanced Breast MR (CEMR) and Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound&#xD;
      (CEUS).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The co-primary endpoints are to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of CEUS relative to&#xD;
      pathology determined diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Positive predictive value of CEDM in detecting lesions seen on MR&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Estimate the negative predictive value (TN/(TN+FN)) of CEUS as an adjunct.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Compare the frequency of recommendation of biopsy of MG±US vs MG±US plus CEUS as an&#xD;
           adjunct based on BIRADS scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Comparison of background enhancement seen on CEUS with that seen on CEDM and CEMR.&#xD;
