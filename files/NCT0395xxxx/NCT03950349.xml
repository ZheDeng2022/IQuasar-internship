      Cervical degenerative disease is an almost universal concomitant of human aging. Over half of&#xD;
      the middle aged population has cervical spondylosis. This condition is often asymptomatic,&#xD;
      but in 10% to 15% of the cases, it is associated with, or progresses to, neural compression.&#xD;
      Cervical spondylotic radiculopathy is a condition due to a root nerve compression while&#xD;
      cervical spondylotic myelopathy is a condition due to a medullar cord compression. Root nerve&#xD;
      or medullar cord can be compressed either by a soft disc extrusion or by arthrosis due to a&#xD;
      degenerative disc. Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion is the standard surgical treatment&#xD;
      of the cervical radiculopathy or cervical myelopathy when non-surgical treatment failed. The&#xD;
      aim of this surgery is to provide a neurologic decompression associated to spine&#xD;
      stabilization. Decompression is achieved by removal the disc and soft disc extrusion if&#xD;
      present. Stabilization is supported by implantation of material in the interbody space like&#xD;
      bone or cage with bone substitute. This cage provides a bone fusion matrix and an&#xD;
      intervertebral height and stability support at the same time. To enforce the stabilization, a&#xD;
      plate can be screwed on the anterior cervical vertebral wall. The HRCC® cage is a stand-alone&#xD;
      cage with two rotary blades which penetrate into vertebral bone so there is no need to&#xD;
      implant plate. One of the reasons why treatment can fail is the pseudarthrosis that is fusion&#xD;
      failure. It mays occur as an increase of axial pain or radicular pain. The aim of this study&#xD;
      is to demonstrate similar results on bone fusion in the surgical treatment of cervical&#xD;
      radiculopathy or myelopathy with HRCC cage used in anterior cervical discectomy and fusion&#xD;
      compared with other technics based on a prospective cohort study and a literature review. As&#xD;
      secondary outcomes we will search to correlate pseudarthrosis and quality of life impact, to&#xD;
      identify complications and to describe the sagittal balance evolution of the cervical spine.&#xD;
      To this end, in the context of standard practices, patients who consult the neurosurgical&#xD;
      team of the REIMS University Hospital Center with a diagnosis of a cervical radiculopathy or&#xD;
      myelopathy with non-surgical treatment failure needing a one level anterior cervical&#xD;
      discectomy and fusion will be proposed to be included during this pre-operative consultation.&#xD;
      There will be pre-operative collected data about demographic data, pseudarthrosis risk&#xD;
      factors, pre-operative symptomatology, quality of life data and pre-operative imagery data.&#xD;
      Per-operative and hospitalization data are collected as well with surgery duration, blood&#xD;
      lost, surgical technic, pain measurement and hospitalization duration. Next, follow-up starts&#xD;
      with consultations at 6 weeks, 6 months and 12 months and pain, quality of life and classic&#xD;
      X-Ray data are collected to be compared with pre-operative data. And Imagery data are&#xD;
      collected in order to identify presence or absence of pseudarthrosis with dynamic X-Ray and&#xD;
      CT-scan at 6 months and 12 months. A statistical analysis of the data is next performed to&#xD;
      found significant results.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cervical degenerative disease is an almost universal concomitant of human aging. Over half of&#xD;
      the middle aged population has radiological or pathological evidence of cervical spondylosis.&#xD;
      This condition is often asymptomatic, but in 10% to 15% of the cases, it is associated with,&#xD;
      or progresses to, neural compression. Cervical spondylotic radiculopathy is a condition due&#xD;
      to a root nerve compression while cervical spondylotic myelopathy is a condition due to a&#xD;
      medullar cord compression. Root nerve or medullar cord can be compressed either by a soft&#xD;
      disc extrusion or by osteophyte due to a degenerative disc. Anterior cervical discectomy and&#xD;
      fusion is the gold standard treatment of those conditions when non-surgical treatment failed.&#xD;
      The aim of this surgery is to provide a neurologic decompression associated to an&#xD;
      intervertebral segmental stabilization. Decompression is achieved by discectomy and&#xD;
      stabilization by cervical interbody bone fusion. This bone fusion is supported by&#xD;
      implantation of material in the interbody space like bone or Poly-Ether-Ether-Keton cage with&#xD;
      bone substitute. This cage provides a bone fusion matrix and an intervertebral height and&#xD;
      stability support at the same time. To enforce the stabilization, a plate can be screwed on&#xD;
      the anterior cervical vertebral wall. The HRCC® cage is a stand-alone cage with no need to&#xD;
      implant plate. One risk of this technic is the secondary migration of the cage. That's why&#xD;
      this cage is maintained with two rotary blades which penetrate into vertebral plates. It&#xD;
      allows easier surgical procedure, with a lower duration of surgery. But one of the reasons of&#xD;
      treatment failure is pseudarthrosis. It is defined as the absence of bone bridging the fusion&#xD;
      area without any lucencies. It mays occur as an increase of axial pain or radicular pain. The&#xD;
      aim of this study is to demonstrate similar results on bone fusion in the surgical treatment&#xD;
      of cervical radiculopathy or myelopathy with HRCC cage used in anterior cervical discectomy&#xD;
      and fusion compared with other technics based on a prospective cohort study and a literature&#xD;
      review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materiel and Method In the context of standard practices, patients are included in the study&#xD;
      when they consult the neurosurgical team of the REIMS University Hospital Center with&#xD;
      diagnosis of one level cervical discopathy causing cervical radiculopathy or myelopathy with&#xD;
      non-surgical treatment failure needing a one level anterior cervical discectomy and fusion.&#xD;
      Patients are proposed to be included during this pre-operative consultation and they are&#xD;
      informed about the protocol and the data collected. If they accept it and sign the&#xD;
      non-opposition form, they are included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collected data at the pre-operative consult are classic demographic data with age and&#xD;
      sex, clinic data with weight, height and BMI, pseudarthrosis risk factors with diabete,&#xD;
      tobacco addiction, chronic use of corticosteroid and osteoporosis with confirmed diagnosis,&#xD;
      pre-operative symptomatology with presence of cervical radiculopathy with or without deficit,&#xD;
      cervical myelopathy with or without pyramidal syndrome at the inferior limb and measurement&#xD;
      of neck and radicular arm pain using a numeric scale, quality of life data with the Neck&#xD;
      Disability Index (NDI) and the 12-Item Short Form Survey (SF-12), pre-operative imagery data&#xD;
      with cervical IRM and the discopathy level, with cervical X-Ray in the profile incidence and&#xD;
      measurement of cervical lordosis, measurement of regional lordosis, height. Per-operative&#xD;
      collected data are duration of surgery, bleeding, used bone graft either allograft or&#xD;
      autograft and final arthrodesis level. Immediate post-operative data are collected the last&#xD;
      day of hospitalization with measurement of neck and arm pain using a numeric scale,&#xD;
      complications with dysphagia, dysphonia, cervical compressive hematoma with urgent surgical&#xD;
      revision, motor neurological deficit with rating if present, surgical revision, duration of&#xD;
      the hospitalization in days, post-operative imagery data with cervical lordosis, regional&#xD;
      lordosis, height as previously describe, and cage migration. There is a 12 months follow-up&#xD;
      with consultations at 6 weeks, 6 months and 12 months. Collected data are for all measurement&#xD;
      of neck and radicular arm pain using a numeric scale for the neck and for the arm,&#xD;
      persistence of complications with dysphagia, dysphonia, and motor neurological deficit with&#xD;
      rating if present, imagery data with cervical lordosis, regional lordosis, height as&#xD;
      previously describe, and cage migration. At 6 months and 12 months we add quality of life&#xD;
      data with the NDI and the SF-12, dynamic cervical X-Ray data with the measurement of the&#xD;
      spinous process shift and CT-scan data. The diagnosis of pseudarthrosis is established on&#xD;
      this multimodal imagery. As secondary outcomes, we will search to correlate pseudarthrosis&#xD;
      and quality of life impact, to identify complications and to describe the sagittal balance&#xD;
      evolution of the cervical spine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, when all the data will be collected, statistical analyses will be performed with&#xD;
      description of the cohort and descriptive statistics of all the demographic, radiographic and&#xD;
      clinical parameters detailed above for the whole cohort: Mean (±SD) for the continuous&#xD;
      variables and Median (±IQR) for the categorical variables. A comparison between&#xD;
      pseudarthrosis group and fused group will be performed with univariate analysis (Student&#xD;
      test, Wilcoxon test, Chi2 or Exact Fisher test) then a multivariate analysis will be&#xD;
      performed with a logistic regression.&#xD;
