      Objective: to evaluate the effectiveness and estimate the costs of a Virtual Community of&#xD;
      Practice in the improvement of the activation of patients with Ischemic Heart Disease in&#xD;
      Primary Care .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: pragmatic randomized controlled multicentric trial. Setting: health centres belonging&#xD;
      to the Autonomous Communities of Catalonia, Madrid and the Canary Islands. Population: 246&#xD;
      patients with Ischemic Heart Disease in Primary Care. Randomization: randomization will be&#xD;
      central and automatically performed by the online &quot;e-mpodera&quot; platform and the assigned group&#xD;
      will be communicated to the patient once he or she has entered the platform and completed&#xD;
      baseline assessment. Intervention: the intervention group will be offered participation for 6&#xD;
      months in a Virtual Community of Practice based on a web 2.0 platform in which there is&#xD;
      interaction with other patients and with a multidisciplinary team of professionals. The&#xD;
      intervention will be co-designed with a group of patients and a group of primary and&#xD;
      specialized care professionals. The control group will receive usual care. Measurements: the&#xD;
      main variable will be measured using the Patient Activation Measure questionnaire at&#xD;
      baseline, 6, 12 and 18 months. Secondary variables: sociodemographic and clinical variables&#xD;
      of the patients; knowledge test (questionnaire of risk cardiovascular factories , attitudes&#xD;
      (Self-efficacy Managing Chronic Disease Scale ), adherence to Mediterranean diet&#xD;
      (Mediterranean Diet), level of physical activity (International Physical Activity&#xD;
      Questionnaire), medication adherence (Adherence Refill and Medication Scale (ARMS-e),&#xD;
      depression (Patient Health Questionnaire), anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale),&#xD;
      quality of life (EQ-5D-5L); variables related to the use of health resources; variables&#xD;
      related to the use of the Virtual Community of Practice . Data will be collected from&#xD;
      self-reported questionnaires and the electronic medical records. Analysis: a linear&#xD;
      regression model of mixed effects will be estimated to estimate the effect of participating&#xD;
      in the Virtual Community of Practice. In addition, subgroup analyses will be carried out and&#xD;
      indicators of the functioning of the Virtual Community of Practice will be measured through&#xD;
      techniques of Social Network Analysis and Control Charts. There will be an economic&#xD;
      evaluation of the Virtual Community of Practice from the perspective of the National Health&#xD;
      System and from the social perspective.&#xD;

      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: pragmatic randomized controlled trial, with two parallel arms, multicenter, 18 months&#xD;
      of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time Frame: 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting Primary Care Centres belonging to the Autonomous Communities of Catalonia, (329),&#xD;
      Madrid (262) and the Canary Islands (102).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: patients with a recent diagnosis of ischemic heart disease in follow-up by&#xD;
      Primary Care (diagnosis of ischemic heart disease in the year prior to inclusion in the&#xD;
      study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: age over 18 years; Active diagnosis of ischemic heart disease in the year&#xD;
      prior to inclusion in the study; have Internet at home or phone; be able to follow the&#xD;
      requirements of the study; having signed informed consent for participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: low probability of cooperation in the study, bystanders or displaced&#xD;
      status, institutionalized, with a terminal illness, physical or mental disability that&#xD;
      prevents respond to questionnaires properly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: 246 patients with Heart Disease in Primary Care. (123 patients per arm) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: patients will be randomly assigned to the intervention (VCoP) or control&#xD;
      group. The randomization will be central and automatically performed by the online&#xD;
      &quot;e-mpodera&quot; platform and the assigned group will be communicated to the patient once he or&#xD;
      she has entered the platform and completed baseline assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The intervention group will be offered participation for 6 months in a Virtual Community&#xD;
           of Practice based on a web 2.0 platform in which there is interaction with other&#xD;
           patients and with a multidisciplinary team of professionals. The intervention will be&#xD;
           co-designed with a group of patients and a group of primary and specialized care&#xD;
           professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The control group will not receive any specific intervention. They receive usual care&#xD;
           according to actually clinical practice guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Main Variable: Patient Activation Measure questionnaire. This questionnaire values&#xD;
           activation in patients with chronic diseases. It consists of 13 items that evaluate&#xD;
           people's knowledge, skills and confidence in self-care for their health and medical&#xD;
           care. Measured by a scale type Likert 1-4 with a total score between 0 and 100. 0 is the&#xD;
           worst puntuation and 100 is the best puntuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Knowledge about the disease, assessed through a self-administered self-made&#xD;
           questionnaire. The questionnaire will measure the level of knowledge about secondary&#xD;
           prevention of cardiovascular disease and will be based on the Questionnaire of Factors&#xD;
           of Risk Cardiovascular previous translation-back translation and adaptation to the&#xD;
           Spanish population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Attitude of the patient, measured from the self-administered self-efficacy Managing&#xD;
           Chronic Disease Scale questionnaire . This questionnaire was developed to assess the&#xD;
           self-efficacy or confidence perceived by the person to perform self-care activities for&#xD;
           the management of their chronic disease. Includes 6 items with aspects such as fatigue,&#xD;
           emotions and treatment with response from 1 (no confidence) to 10 (totally confident);&#xD;
           the average final score of all the items is calculated (the higher the score, the more&#xD;
           self-efficacy). This questionnaire has been translated into Spanish and used in our&#xD;
           context in people with heart failure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adhesion to the Mediterranean diet from the Mediterranean Diet questionnaire It is a set&#xD;
           of 14 short questions whose evaluation aims to provide information on adherence to the&#xD;
           Mediterranean diet pattern. Scores below 7 indicate low adherence; Scores above 10&#xD;
           indicate good adherence. It has been validated in the Spanish population in the PREDIMED&#xD;
           study .&#xD;
&#xD;
      International Physical Activity Questionnaire. This questionnaire has been used in several&#xD;
      international studies and its validity has been evaluated recommending its use in different&#xD;
      countries and languages The short version provides information on the time spent walking, in&#xD;
      activities of moderate and vigorous intensity and in sedentary activities. Evaluates three&#xD;
      specific characteristics of the activity: intensity (mild, moderate, vigorous), frequency&#xD;
      (measured in days per week) and duration (time per day). After calculating the physical&#xD;
      activity index, whose value corresponds to the product of the intensity (in METS) by the&#xD;
      frequency, and by the duration of the activity) the patients are classified into three&#xD;
      categories: low, medium and high.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depression - Patient Health Questionnaire-9 .It is an instrument that not only allows&#xD;
      detecting people with depressive disorder, but also allows to define the severity of the&#xD;
      condition and to follow up on these people. It has been validated to Spanish demonstrating&#xD;
      behavior similar to the original in English and a good acceptance by patients . It is a short&#xD;
      instrument, designed to be self-administered. It consists of 9 items that assess the presence&#xD;
      of depressive symptoms (corresponding to the DSM-IV criteria) present in the last 2 weeks.&#xD;
      Each item has a severity index corresponding to: 0 = &quot;never&quot;, 1 = &quot;some days&quot;, 2 = &quot;more than&#xD;
      half of the days&quot; and 3 = &quot;almost every day&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anxiety - Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. This scale is a 14-item questionnaire that&#xD;
      was initially designed for the evaluation of anxiety and depression in non-psychiatric&#xD;
      outpatient hospital services. It is a useful instrument validated in our setting and of&#xD;
      special interest and usefulness in the context of PA. It is a measure composed of two&#xD;
      sub-scales (Hospital Anxiety and Depression - A and Hospital Anxiety and Depression - D), of&#xD;
      seven items each that are scored from 0 to 3. The authors recommend the points of 8 for&#xD;
      possible cases and&gt; 10 for cases probable in both sub-scales. One of its main virtues is the&#xD;
      suppression of somatic symptoms so that it can be evaluated independently of the underlying&#xD;
      somatic disease. However, in patients with coronary artery disease, it has been found that it&#xD;
      underestimates people with depression , while the Hospital Anxiety and Depression - A&#xD;
      sub-scale has a good specificity and predictive value to measure anxiety in this context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adherence to medication: Will be assessed with the Adherence Refill and Medication Adherence&#xD;
      Scale (ARMS-e), validated in Spain and used to measure adherence to medication in patients&#xD;
      with chronic diseases. It consists of 12 questions and there is no cut-off point, the lower&#xD;
      the score, the better the adherence. To quantify adherence, a value of 1 to 4 (never,&#xD;
      sometimes, almost always or always) is assigned to each of the responses according to a&#xD;
      Likert-type scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life related to health - E5-5D-5L The EQ-5D, developed by the EuroQol Group&#xD;
      (www.euroqol.org), is a generic and standardized instrument designed to describe and assess&#xD;
      the quality of life related to health in both relatively healthy individuals (general&#xD;
      population) and in groups of patients with different pathologies. It has been prepared in&#xD;
      several languages, including Spanish, and used in various contexts, including the PA . The&#xD;
      EQ-5D was born to try to offer a measure of self-perceived health that incorporated the&#xD;
      individual preferences (utilities) on health status and that would serve as a measure of&#xD;
      effectiveness in the economic evaluation of health technologies and health policies. It&#xD;
      allows to reflect the quality of life associated with health, with the amount of life and&#xD;
      offer a value of the gains in health, the Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY). It consists of 2&#xD;
      parts: the person assesses their state of health, first in levels of severity by dimensions&#xD;
      (descriptive system) and then in a visual analog scale (EVA) of more general evaluation. A&#xD;
      third element of the EQ-5D is the index of social values obtained for each health state&#xD;
      generated by the instrument. The descriptive EQ-5D system comprises 5 dimensions (mobility,&#xD;
      personal care, daily activities, pain / discomfort and anxiety / depression). In the EVA the&#xD;
      individual scores his health between two extremes, 0 and 100, worse and better state of&#xD;
      health imaginable. The EQ-5D is available in two versions for adults, with 3 levels and 5&#xD;
      levels of response options, EQ-5D-3L and EQ-5D-5L, respectively. The EQ-5D-5L has shown to be&#xD;
      a valid extension of the EQ-5D-3L that improves the measurement properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of health resources through a self-administered questionnaire contrasted with Clinical&#xD;
      History information: visits to the doctor and / or nurse in the last 3 months, hospital&#xD;
      admissions during the intervention, temporary or permanent ITs (number and time).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Explanatory and adjustment variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of the patient (first level): Sociodemographic: age, sex, nationality, Autonomous Communities&#xD;
      of residence, marital status (married / couple, single, separated, divorced, widowed),&#xD;
      educational level (incomplete primary studies, complete primary education, education&#xD;
      secondary school, university studies or equivalent), lives alone (yes / no), current&#xD;
      occupation; Morbidity: type (stable angina, unstable angina, AMI), duration of ischemic heart&#xD;
      disease (months), ventricular ejection fraction (≤ 35%,&gt; 35%), classification of the New York&#xD;
      Heart Association (I-IV), number and description of chronic concomitant diseases (O'Halloran&#xD;
      list (63)); Treatment: pharmacological (acetylsalicylic acid or clopidogrel, beta-blockers,&#xD;
      statins, other treatments), participation in a cardiac rehabilitation program before and&#xD;
      during the study period (yes / no). This information will be collected from a&#xD;
      self-administered self-prepared questionnaire contrasted with information from the Clinical&#xD;
      History.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinics: blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), lipid profile (HDL-C, LDL-C), smoking habit,&#xD;
      number and frequency of anginal episodes. These variables will be collected through a&#xD;
      self-administered self-prepared questionnaire contrasted with information from the Clinical&#xD;
      History.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      An analysis of multilevel mixed models is proposed for the main result, where the response&#xD;
      variable will be the difference between the final and initial score obtained in the attitude&#xD;
      questionnaire administered to the participating professionals and the explanatory variable&#xD;
      will be the dichotomous intervention variable (1 = Virtual Community of Practice / 0 =&#xD;
      Control). This model will consider the co-variables age, sex and clinical characteristics of&#xD;
      the patient with Heart Disease and will take into account the random effect associated with&#xD;
      Primary Care Centre. To control a possible selection bias and increase the accuracy of the&#xD;
      model, the Propensity Score will be used. The analyzes will be carried out by intention to&#xD;
      deal with the statistical software R Core Team (2014) http://www.R-project.org/ and&#xD;
      Statistical Package for the Social Sciences 18.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis: a linear regression model of mixed effects will be estimated to estimate the effect&#xD;
      of participating in theVirtual Community of Practice. In addition, subgroup analyses will be&#xD;
      carried out and indicators of the functioning of the Virtual Community of Practice will be&#xD;
      measured through techniques of Social Network Analysis and Control Charts. There will be an&#xD;
      economic evaluation of the Virtual Community of Practice from the perspective of the National&#xD;
      Health System and from the social perspective.&#xD;
