  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of cebranopadol (GRT6005) on the&#xD;
      electrical activity of the heart in healthy participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consisted of a screening period within 21 days before the first dose of&#xD;
      investigational medicinal product (IMP) (between Day -25 and Day -4) during which informed&#xD;
      consent was obtained and the general suitability of the participants for the trial was&#xD;
      assessed according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were confined to the trial site from 4 days before first IMP dosing on Day 1 to&#xD;
      4 days after last IMP dosing on Day 30. During this period, multiple-doses of cebranopadol or&#xD;
      matching placebo and a single-dose of moxifloxacin or matching placebo were administered.&#xD;
      Moxifloxacin was used as a positive control. It has consistently shown that it has an effect&#xD;
      on the heart rhythm. Continuous 12-lead ECGs were recorded at defined time points. Multiple&#xD;
      blood and urine samples were drawn for pharmacokinetic evaluations and safety laboratory&#xD;
      monitoring (hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis). Additional safety evaluations included&#xD;
      recording of adverse events, vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate,&#xD;
      respiration rate, body temperature, and weight), oxygen saturation, standard 12-lead ECG,&#xD;
      Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) assessment, and Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating&#xD;
      Scale (C-SSRS) assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An End-of-Trial Visit was performed on Day 34, or within 7 days after the last&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic sample on Day 34, or at early withdrawal.&#xD;
