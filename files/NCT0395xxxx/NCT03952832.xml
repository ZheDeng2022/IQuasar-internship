    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well leflunomide works in treating patients with high-risk&#xD;
      smoldering multiple myeloma. Leflunomide may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some&#xD;
      of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the anti-myeloma activity of leflunomide, when given as a single agent, as&#xD;
      assessed by freedom from progression at 2-years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of single agent leflunomide. II. To summarize and&#xD;
      assess toxicities by type, frequency, severity, attribution, time course and duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To estimate overall and progression-free survival probabilities. IV. To estimate&#xD;
      response rate and duration of response. V. To describe the impact of treatment on quality of&#xD;
      life, as assessed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality&#xD;
      of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) Score version (v)3.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize the molecular evolution of the tumor cells. II. To evaluate whether&#xD;
      specific genetic subtypes respond differently to leflunomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the role of immune cells in the progression of smoldering multiple myeloma&#xD;
      (SMM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate the role of leflunomide in modulating the immune system. V. To examine the&#xD;
      relationship between immunological changes and disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive leflunomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28&#xD;
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 28 days.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women and women who are lactating; leflunomide has potential for teratogenic&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Prospective participants who, in the opinion of the investigator, may not be able to&#xD;
             comply with all study procedures (including compliance issues related to&#xD;
             feasibility/logistics)&#xD;
