  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Emergency Department (ED) can be stressful and traumatic, especially for children and&#xD;
      young people, and the clinical environment can be a frightening, unfamiliar space, which adds&#xD;
      to an already anxious experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Musicians from Cascade Music, who have an established track record of working with the&#xD;
      Paediatric ED, will provide recruited participants in the experimental arm with high-quality&#xD;
      calming, distracting music during selected procedures. A wide range of music will be used,&#xD;
      ranging from nursery rhymes to classical to pop tunes, to engage with and comfort children,&#xD;
      taking their attention away from their immediate pain or distress. Pain scores throughout the&#xD;
      procedure will be self-assessed by patients (if old enough to use a self assessment tool i.e.&#xD;
      3 years and above) as well as observed by a Research Nurse. Qualitative data on distress and&#xD;
      the experiences of patients, families and staff will also be collected via a questionnaire.&#xD;
      Participants recruited to the control arm will complete the same measures but receive no live&#xD;
      music.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project is underpinned by three areas of need:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Despite there being a wide breadth of clinical studies that have used music within&#xD;
           various healthcare settings, one area that has been almost completely unexplored is the&#xD;
           Paediatric Emergency Department (PED). Alder Hey Children's Hospital (AHCH), as a world&#xD;
           leader in research, is ideally situated to conduct this preliminary research.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. By 2020 AHCH plans to be a world class, child-focused centre of research, innovation and&#xD;
           education expertise to improve the health and wellbeing outcomes for children and young&#xD;
           people. Supporting patients through stressful and invasive procedures is crucial.&#xD;
           Inspired by the patients and families that we care for, this research fits well with the&#xD;
           AHCH vision, demonstrating an innovative and evidence-informed approach to enhancing&#xD;
           practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The University of Liverpool's impact intensive approach to research is a key strength.&#xD;
           This study is designed to have a positive immediate impact on the children and young&#xD;
           people participating and those undergoing interventional procedures in the future,&#xD;
           helping to enhance patient experience of the ED.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Value of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a growing evidence-base for the use of music in healthcare settings, with music&#xD;
      already demonstrated to reduce stress, distress and the perception of pain in some clinical&#xD;
      contexts. Yet, there is a lack of studies examining the impact of live music in paediatric&#xD;
      emergency contexts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A literature review revealed that there is a lack of studies examining the impact of live&#xD;
      music in paediatric emergency contexts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Related studies either used recorded music in the place of live music, or, if live music was&#xD;
      used, then it was within a non-emergency setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Music:ED study will therefore use a controlled experimental design to investigate the&#xD;
      impact of using therapeutic live music in the Alder Hey Paediatric Emergency Department to&#xD;
      reduce pain and distress during interventional procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcomes of the study will provide evidence for the use of live music in the PED to&#xD;
      support and enhance patient experience. Distress is often particularly high within the&#xD;
      emergency department. If a patient's experience whilst attending the Emergency Department can&#xD;
      be less traumatic, this will be of benefit to all: patients, families and clinicians. A&#xD;
      patient who is less distressed is more cooperative and may be easier and quicker to treat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Does live music decrease the pain and distress of patients undergoing a procedure within the&#xD;
      paediatric emergency department?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims of the Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims/objectives include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To explore whether live music helps to decrease pain and distress in patients in the&#xD;
           Paediatric Emergency Department&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To explore whether procedures can be carried out with greater ease from a clinician's&#xD;
           perspective and whether staff experience of the situation is impacted by the presence of&#xD;
           live music.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Exploring the overall impact on the ED experience from the patients, families and&#xD;
           clinicians' perspectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodological Approach:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A mixed method design has been chosen to provide the investigators with different forms of&#xD;
      data and insights from multiple practitioner, parent and patient perspectives throughout the&#xD;
      experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative data includes collecting information about the patient's pain levels using both&#xD;
      self-assessed pain scores (Wong Baker scoring) and assessed pain scores (FLACC pain tool).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative data will be collected from open response questionnaires to explore patient&#xD;
      distress and the practitioner, parent and patient perspectives on the experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be an experimental (live music) and a control (no live music) group. Research&#xD;
      Nurses will identify appropriate patients using a screening tool that will outline the&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria. Participant Information Sheets (PIS) will be provided to&#xD;
      patients and their families for their appropriate ages. They will be offered a copy of the&#xD;
      results if they would like and will be told how the results will be reported when the study&#xD;
      is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After gaining written consent from the parent and written or verbal assent from the child,&#xD;
      Wong-Baker pain scoring methods will be explained in advance of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Necessary data will be collected for the Case Report Form (CRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant's involvement in the study will be limited to the length of time of their&#xD;
      Emergency Department visit, so will be just one day and one procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the experimental (music) group, Cascade's musicians will spend eight weeks, twelve hours&#xD;
      per week in the ED and will aim to recruit all eligible children during that period. As this&#xD;
      is a pilot study recruitment targets need to remain flexible, but are estimated at 60-80&#xD;
      participants (per group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same number of participants will be recruited to the control (no live music) group as a&#xD;
      comparison, on days that the musicians are not in the department. All patients in both groups&#xD;
      will continue to receive standard care. Each child can only be in the study once and for one&#xD;
      procedure. Patients will be free to withdraw from the study at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the procedure and interviews, patients involved will be offered a sticker and a CD&#xD;
      of calming music recorded by Cascade Music as a thank you for their participation. For&#xD;
      ethical reasons, this will not be mentioned in advance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods of data collection and analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three sets of data will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Quantitative: Self-reported pain. A validated observational tool will be used: Wong&#xD;
           Baker Faces. This is suitable for children age 3+. As children self-report, the Research&#xD;
           Nurse will collect this data on a paper CRF. Wong Baker scores will be collected before,&#xD;
           during and after the procedure. If mid-procedure collection of pain score is&#xD;
           inappropriate, then participants can be asked about mid-procedure pain scores after the&#xD;
           procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A self-reported pain score will also be taken in advance, during the recruitment&#xD;
           process, to provide a baseline measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Quantitative: Observed pain. Data will be collected on observed pain levels using a&#xD;
           validated observational tool: Faces, Legs, Activity, Cry and Consolability (FLACC) pain&#xD;
           assessment tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This tool is suitable and validated for all ages of the recruited participants, from 6&#xD;
           months until 16 years. References regarding justification of this scale for these age&#xD;
           ranges are below.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Scoring will take place before, during and after the procedure. The Research Nurse will&#xD;
           carry out this scoring, and when available, an independent observer from the Emergency&#xD;
           Department staff will also. The Research Nurse will collect this data on the paper CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Heart rate will also be monitored throughout, where a child is cooperative enough. HR&#xD;
           will be noted approximately every two minutes before, during and after procedure,&#xD;
           (cleaning marks the beginning of the procedure, final bandage/dressing marks the&#xD;
           completion). The Research Nurse will note HR data on the CRF. There will be an option&#xD;
           for the Research Nurse to record 'not available' for heart rate measurements either&#xD;
           because child refuses or because of probe or monitor issues etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Qualitative: Distress and experiences of patients, families and clinicians. Outcome&#xD;
           measures will include collecting qualitative information on patient's distress, and&#xD;
           patients', families' and clinician's Emergency Department experience. All recruited&#xD;
           patients will receive a paper questionnaire with open text response options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative questions for Experimental AND Control Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following two questions will be asked of both the experimental (live music) AND control&#xD;
      (no live music) groups. The questions will be asked of each of these two people: patient and&#xD;
      parent/legal guardian.&#xD;
&#xD;
      'Please answer the following questions, in particular, in regard to distress levels/lack of&#xD;
      distress':&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Qualitative question 1. What do you think helped you/your child during their procedure?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Qualitative question 2. Did anything make the situation worse?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative questions for Experimental Group Only:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the experimental group only, the following three additional questions will be asked,&#xD;
      via a paper questionnaire, of each of these three people: patient, parent/legal guardian and&#xD;
      clinician. These questions directly link to the objectives of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These questions are in particular regard to music, which is why they would not be appropriate&#xD;
      to be asked of the control (no live music) group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Qualitative Question 1. How did you feel the music affected the child's distress before,&#xD;
           during and after the procedure?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Qualitative Question 2. Can you tell me about how the live music helped or hindered the&#xD;
           procedure?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Qualitative Question 3. Can you tell me about your experience of the ED (Emergency&#xD;
           Department) today, in particular in regard to the music?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The qualitative questions will be included in a open ended questionnaire style sheet which&#xD;
      the parent, child or practitioner if the parent wishes, can fill out between the end of the&#xD;
      music intervention and when they are discharged from the ward. It will be collected by the RN&#xD;
      and stored in a secure room in a locked filing cabinet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target population and sampling This will be a single centre study. Study participants for&#xD;
      both the control and experimental groups of the study will be recruited from AHCH Emergency&#xD;
      Department. The study population will consist of children between the age of 6 months and 16&#xD;
      years needing to undergo a painful procedure from a specified list. The Research Nurse will&#xD;
      use a screening tool to assess eligibility within this age group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Necessary data will be collected for the CRF (Case Report Form) by the Research Nurse:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CRF:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient's name&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient's age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient's gender&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parent(s)/legal guardian in attendance during procedure (names)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Whether or not the patient has had this procedure before&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How many times the child has visited the hospital in the last 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have they had an upsetting hospital experience in the past? Yes or no&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record a Wong-Baker pain score at this point (for children age 3+) as a baseline measure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record whether patient has had analgesia in advance, or during hospital visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record use of local anaesthetics e.g EMLA/ametop, LAT gel, cold spray (ethyl chloride)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record use of Entonox during the procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record if other distraction methods were also used (Play&#xD;
           Specialist/books/bubbles/IPad/TV/ IPhone/ staff dancing and singing, etc)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record whether the procedure was successful&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record the duration of the procedure (cleaning marks the beginning of the procedure,&#xD;
           final bandage/dressing marks the completion)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record how many attempts were required to carry out procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record the role and grade of the Clinician carrying out the procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record heart rate at 2-minute intervals if tolerated. Include option for the research&#xD;
           nurse to record 'not available' for heart rate measurements either because child refuses&#xD;
           or if probe or monitor issues etc&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record whether there is an independent observer present. If so, who?&#xD;
