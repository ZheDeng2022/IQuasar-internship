  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervical cancer is the most common cause of death from gynecological cancer world-wide. With&#xD;
      technological innovation, minimally invasive or even non-invasive medical treatment has&#xD;
      become a trend. Since the first cases of laparoscopic radical hysterectomy of cervical cancer&#xD;
      have been reported in 1992, many single-center observational cohort studies have shown that&#xD;
      compared to open abdominal surgery ，minimally invasive surgery (laparoscopic or robotic&#xD;
      radical hysterectomy) showed advantages of less blood loss, shorter hospital stay and fewer&#xD;
      intraoperative complications, while the 5-year survival and disease-free survival were&#xD;
      similar. The NCCN guidelines and ESGO recommendations also clearly indicated that patients&#xD;
      with FIGO stage IA2 -IIA cervical cancer could undergo open or laparoscopic/robotic radical&#xD;
      hysterectomy. However, in October 2018, the results of two studies published in the《New&#xD;
      England Journal of Medicine》have subverted our traditional perception of minimally invasive&#xD;
      surgery and caused widespread controversy in the field of gynecologic oncology treatment.&#xD;
      Both studies showed that the survival rate in the minimally invasive surgery group was lower&#xD;
      than that in the open surgery group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of these two studies have brought unprecedented doubts and challenges to the&#xD;
      minimally invasive surgery for cervical cancer. The MD Anderson Cancer Center has even&#xD;
      stopped minimally invasive surgery for cervical cancer. Several hospitals in Hong Kong have&#xD;
      responded similarly. The NCCN guidelines are also quickly updated based on the results of&#xD;
      those studies: patients should be informed of the results of this study and doctors should&#xD;
      respect the patient's choices. The above research results have also attracted the attention&#xD;
      of many gynecological oncologists in the mainland China. Some experts questioned the design&#xD;
      of this study design as well as surgical skills. We need to look at these findings&#xD;
      cautiously. So, we launched a real-world study of clinical outcomes affected by different&#xD;
      surgical treatment for patients of early stage cervical cancer. We plan to recruit 2000&#xD;
      patients with early cervical cancer from 20-30 selected surgical centers nationwide and&#xD;
      perform surgery on patients with qualified and experienced doctors.We will inform the&#xD;
      patients current status of the study in detail, divide the patients into different&#xD;
      observational group according to their choices on surgical methods. The patients will be&#xD;
      followed up closely after surgery. We will compare the differences in clinical outcomes&#xD;
      between the two surgical methods and conduct subgroup and stratified analysis. We hope that&#xD;
      this study can truly reflect the actual status and clinical l level of early cervical cancer&#xD;
      treatment in China, and provide a high level of clinical evidence for the treatment of&#xD;
      cervical cancer in China .&#xD;

      The study is a non-randomized, prospective, multi-center, clinical study.Patients with early&#xD;
      cervical cancer who were enrolled will be divided into two groups: minimally invasive surgery&#xD;
      group (group A) and open abdominal surgery group (group B) according to the patient's choice&#xD;
      on surgical methods.We will standardize the surgery details according to the factors that may&#xD;
      affect the prognosis of cancer treatment in the minimally invasive surgery of cervical&#xD;
      cancer, such as : emphasizing the tumor-free principle of surgery; using a ligation band to&#xD;
      tighten the vagina before cutting the vagina; avoiding the use of the cup-shaped uterine&#xD;
      manipulator；reducing frequent changes in CO2 abdominal pressure；or using a laparoscope-assist&#xD;
      transvaginal hysterectomy and other methods to avoid the risk of tumor tissue shedding.&#xD;
      Patients with high risk factors after surgery will receive follow-up treatment according to&#xD;
      the 2018 NCCN guidelines.&#xD;
