  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to perform a prospective study that is histology-independent&#xD;
      personalized navigation approach to cancer therapy based upon tumor molecular profile as&#xD;
      determined by Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certified comprehensive&#xD;
      genomic analysis. The molecular mutation profile will then be matched to existing,&#xD;
      FDA-approved, targeted agents or to existing clinical trials using investigational agents for&#xD;
      treatment of patients with incurable hematologic malignancies for whom no effective standard&#xD;
      therapy exists or who have either exhausted or are intolerant of standard options.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with incurable hematologic malignancies with ≥50% 2-year cancer-associated&#xD;
             mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with relapsed/refractory hematologic malignancies, irrespective of 2-year&#xD;
             mortality, who, in the opinion of the investigator, have no treatment option expected&#xD;
             to yield significant clinical benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a rare tumor histology (i.e., fewer than 6 cases per 100,000 per year)&#xD;
             with no approved therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable disease for malignancies: defined as at least one lesion&#xD;
             that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension with spiral CT scan, PET-CT,&#xD;
             MRI, or calipers by clinical exam. Or presence of hematologic abnormalities with or&#xD;
             without bone marrow involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have evaluable tissue/blood with adequate tumor content/purity for&#xD;
             testing as specified by the molecular profiling lab. This will be obtained during the&#xD;
             standard of care tumor diagnosis and tumor staging evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG Performance Status 0-2.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Adequate organ function that reasonably allows for safe administration of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At the time of treatment, patients should be off other anti-tumor agents for at least&#xD;
             5 half-lives of the agent or 2 weeks from the last day of treatment, whichever is&#xD;
             shorter, so long as there is recovery from clinically significant side effects from&#xD;
             previous therapy to less than or equal Grade 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to swallow and/or retain oral medication, if needed.&#xD;

             contraception during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have at least one of the following for a diagnosis/disease status:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Advanced symptomatic disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Medically unfit for standard therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Disease where no conventional therapy leads to a survival benefit &gt; 3 months in the&#xD;
             respective cohort and line of therapy for which the patient is otherwise eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Actionable biologically informed targets determined by certified genomic profiling,&#xD;
             immunophenotyping or other clinically validated techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe or uncontrolled medical disorder that would, in the investigator's opinion,&#xD;
             confound study analyses of treatment response or preclude the patient from safely&#xD;
             receiving treatment (i.e. substance abuse or psychiatric illness/social situations&#xD;
             that would limit compliance with study requirements).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy, breast-feeding women or any patient with childbearing potential not using&#xD;
             adequate pregnancy prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inadequate end organ function that would preclude safe administration of&#xD;
             anti-neoplastic therapy; including hepatic dysfunction (LFTs &gt; 5 x normal limit, total&#xD;
             bilirubin &gt; 3 and Cr &gt; 3 x normal limit or GFR &lt; 20 cc/min, or symptomatic heart&#xD;
             failure (EF &lt; 20%), except when organ function impairment is a consequence of&#xD;
             underlying malignancy and there is a reasonable expectation for improvement following&#xD;
             initiation of appropriate therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled infections or sepsis. Patients with chronic viral infections (including&#xD;
             HIV, HBV/HCV) that are controlled with appropriate concurrent therapy are allowed to&#xD;
             participate in the study, provided ongoing compliance with antiviral therapy can be&#xD;
             reasonably expected throughout the duration of the study. Patients with acute&#xD;
             infections must start appropriate anti-microbial therapy and demonstrate stabilization&#xD;
             of infection prior to study initiation.&#xD;
