  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe the safety and efficacy of opicapone plus standard&#xD;
      of care in elderly patients with PD in the real-world setting&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a multinational, multicentre, prospective non-interventional study in elderly&#xD;
      patients with PD. Approximately 100 patients with PD will be recruited by specialists from&#xD;
      approximately 37 sites in European countries. The total enrolment period will be one year,&#xD;
      and each patient will be followed for up to one year after enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PD patients with end-of-dose motor fluctuations suitable for additional treatment&#xD;
      optimization will be included in the study and split into 2 cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1: 50 patients; standard of care (including L-DOPA) + starting opicapone&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2: 50 patients; standard of care (including L-DOPA Data will be collected at&#xD;
           baseline (date of enrolment), 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months after&#xD;
           enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This non-interventional study does not recommend the use of any specific treatments. Use of&#xD;
      opicapone and of standard of care are only driven by the physician's decision.&#xD;
