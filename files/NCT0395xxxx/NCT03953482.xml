  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anaphylaxis is a hypersensitivity reaction systemic, generalized, severe, life-threatening&#xD;
      that may result from exposure to a triggering factor. The prevalence of anaphylaxis is 0.05&#xD;
      to 2% in the general population. Most reactions appear within 30 minutes after contact with&#xD;
      the triggering factor and last up to 6 hours. The main triggering factors are: 1/food,&#xD;
      2/hymenopteran bites, 3/drugs. The main treatment is the early administration of adrenaline&#xD;
      by Intramuscular route on medical prescription or by AAI (adrenaline auto-injector)&#xD;
      associated with the exclusion of the allergen. Adrenaline treatment should be administered as&#xD;
      soon as possible, a failure or delay in the use of adrenaline is a risk factor for death.&#xD;
      Anaphylaxis is a chronic disease and the patient must be informed from the first episode&#xD;
      about the risk of recurrence and the risk of death he is exposed to. Patient education is&#xD;
      essential for the complete removal of the triggering factor, recognition of anaphylaxis&#xD;
      symptoms and use of AAI. The risk of recurrence is high given the difficulty to completely&#xD;
      eliminate the favourable factor (mainly food causes and hymenopteran bites): 1/3 of deaths&#xD;
      from food anaphylaxis occur at home, and the peak mortality rate is between 10 and 30 years&#xD;
      old. The diagnosis of anaphylaxis can be difficult because the symptomatology can be so&#xD;
      varied. It is under-diagnosed, which leads to a lack of medical care and therefore an&#xD;
      under-prescription of AAI. Some American studies identifying emergency room visits for&#xD;
      anaphylaxis find that in less than 30% of cases there is a prescription for AAI, in less than&#xD;
      40% of advices about triggering factor's eviction and in less than 20% a guidance to an&#xD;
      allergology consultation. In France, the HAS published in 2013 a procedure to be followed&#xD;
      after the treatment of a suspected anaphylaxis: the patient's management must be diagnostic,&#xD;
      therapeutic and educational. It must be systematically based on three axes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the prescription of AAI with an explanation of its use,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the provision of written information on the mechanism and symptoms of anaphylaxis,&#xD;
           attitude to be followed in event of an anaphylactic reaction, and need for eviction if&#xD;
           the allergen has been identified,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  guidance to an allergology consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapeutic education for anaphylactic patients is essential given the risk involved. In an&#xD;
      American study, it was shown that only 60% of teens and young adults suffering from food&#xD;
      allergies report having AAI systematically with them. Information and education is therefore&#xD;
      essential for these patients.&#xD;
