    <measure>Baseline Patient Characteristics: Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline characteristics were recorded 12 months pre-index event (pre-treatment).</time_frame>
    <description>IQVIA's GE Centricity Electronic medical records database was used for this study. This is an anonymized HIPPA compliant database populated with patient data from ambulatory care records. Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) for Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) patients at 12-month pre-treatment (baseline) was compared between each of the cohorts.&#xD;
The Charlson Comorbidity Index is a method of categorizing comorbidities of patients based on the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnosis. Each comorbidity category has an associated weight (from 1 to 6), based on the adjusted risk of mortality or resource use, and the sum of all the weights results in a single comorbidity score for a patient. A score of zero indicates that no comorbidities were found. The higher the score, the more likely the predicted outcome will result in mortality or higher resource use. Up to 12 comorbidities with various weightings can result in a maximum score of 24. The minimum score is zero.</description>

Treatment with Proton pump inhibitors for Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) patients at 12-month pre-treatment (baseline) was compared between each of the cohorts (nintedanib vs. pirfenidone, nintedanib vs. untreated, pirfenidone vs. untreated), differences are presented in absolute standardized differences (ASD), differences were tested using t-test for means of continuous variables, Wilcoxon signed tank test for medians of continuous variables, and Chi-square test for categorical variables.</description>

    <measure>Odds Ratio of Receiving Treatment (Nintedanib or Pirfenidone) vs no Treatment</measure>

    <description>Odds ratio of receiving nintedanib or pirfenidone vs. no antifibrotic treatment, adjusting for patient characteristics; to identify baseline characteristics that drive initiation of a treatment while minimizing prescription bias.&#xD;
Logistic regression models were developed to assess the odds. Baseline patient characteristics that were sufficiently populated, had ASD &gt;10% or p-value &lt;0.05, and were agreed upon as important variables to include, were included as covariates for a full model. Linearity of age was confirmed before including it as a continuous variable in one version of the model. Backward selection was applied to develop a reduced model, only retaining covariates with p&lt;0.1 after forcing age at index, gender, geographic region, BMI, CCI, and Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) into the model.&#xD;
Odds presented for key patient characteristics. Odd ratio of &gt;1 indicates increased odds of receiving treatment.</description>

The patient characteristic age for Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) patients at 12-month pre-treatment (baseline) was compared between each of the cohorts (nintedanib vs. pirfenidone, nintedanib vs. untreated, pirfenidone vs. untreated), differences are presented in absolute standardized differences (ASD), differences were tested using t-test for means of continuous variables, Wilcoxon signed tank test for medians of continuous variables, and Chi-square test for categorical variables.</description>

        <description>Odds ratio of receiving nintedanib or pirfenidone vs. no antifibrotic treatment, adjusting for patient characteristics; to identify baseline characteristics that drive initiation of a treatment while minimizing prescription bias.&#xD;
Logistic regression models were developed to assess the odds. Baseline patient characteristics that were sufficiently populated, had ASD &gt;10% or p-value &lt;0.05, and were agreed upon as important variables to include, were included as covariates for a full model. Linearity of age was confirmed before including it as a continuous variable in one version of the model. Backward selection was applied to develop a reduced model, only retaining covariates with p&lt;0.1 after forcing age at index, gender, geographic region, BMI, CCI, and Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) into the model.&#xD;
Odds presented for key patient characteristics. Odd ratio of &gt;1 indicates increased odds of receiving treatment.</description>

        <title>Baseline Patient Characteristics: Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI)</title>
        <description>IQVIA's GE Centricity Electronic medical records database was used for this study. This is an anonymized HIPPA compliant database populated with patient data from ambulatory care records. Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) for Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) patients at 12-month pre-treatment (baseline) was compared between each of the cohorts.&#xD;
The Charlson Comorbidity Index is a method of categorizing comorbidities of patients based on the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnosis. Each comorbidity category has an associated weight (from 1 to 6), based on the adjusted risk of mortality or resource use, and the sum of all the weights results in a single comorbidity score for a patient. A score of zero indicates that no comorbidities were found. The higher the score, the more likely the predicted outcome will result in mortality or higher resource use. Up to 12 comorbidities with various weightings can result in a maximum score of 24. The minimum score is zero.</description>

          <title>Baseline Patient Characteristics: Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI)</title>
          <description>IQVIA's GE Centricity Electronic medical records database was used for this study. This is an anonymized HIPPA compliant database populated with patient data from ambulatory care records. Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) for Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) patients at 12-month pre-treatment (baseline) was compared between each of the cohorts.&#xD;
The Charlson Comorbidity Index is a method of categorizing comorbidities of patients based on the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnosis. Each comorbidity category has an associated weight (from 1 to 6), based on the adjusted risk of mortality or resource use, and the sum of all the weights results in a single comorbidity score for a patient. A score of zero indicates that no comorbidities were found. The higher the score, the more likely the predicted outcome will result in mortality or higher resource use. Up to 12 comorbidities with various weightings can result in a maximum score of 24. The minimum score is zero.</description>

Data derived from IQVIA's GE Centricity EMR (Electronic medical records) data.

          <title>Pirfenidone</title>
          <description>Cohort of patients with an Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) diagnosis who were first prescribed Pirfenidone from October 1, 2014 to October 31, 2018. Data derived from IQVIA's GE Centricity EMR (Electronic medical records) data. The EMR consisted of patient data from ambulatory care records in the US, representing the US population receiving healthcare in the ambulatory setting. The index date was the date of the first Pirfenidone prescription.</description>

          <title>Untreated</title>
          <description>Cohort of patients with an Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) diagnosis who were not prescribed antifibrotic treatment (i.e., no prescription for nintedanib nor pirfenidone during the data window) from October 1, 2014 to October 31, 2018. Data derived from IQVIA's GE Centricity EMR (Electronic medical records) data. The EMR consisted of patient data from ambulatory care records in the US, representing the US population receiving healthcare in the ambulatory setting. The index date for the untreated cohort was randomly assigned to mimic the distribution of time from the earliest IPF diagnosis to index in the two treatment cohorts.</description>
