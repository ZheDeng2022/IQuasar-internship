      This is a Phase 1b safety and tolerability single-sequence study in which PAH subjects on a&#xD;
      stable regimen of Tyvaso will switch to a corresponding dose of TreT.&#xD;

      United Therapeutics Corporation (UTC) is developing a combination drug-device product which&#xD;
      is comprised of a dry powder formulation of Treprostinil Inhalation Powder (TreT) and a&#xD;
      small, portable, dry powder inhaler. In this Phase 1b safety and tolerability study, patients&#xD;
      with PAH on a stable dose of Tyvaso (6 to 12 breaths 4 times daily [QID]) will be evaluated&#xD;
      after switching to a corresponding dose of TreT. Patients will undergo PK assessments, safety&#xD;
      assessments, a 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT), and questionnaires for satisfaction/preference for&#xD;
      inhaled devices and patient-reported PAH symptoms and impact. Following 3 weeks of treatment&#xD;
      with TreT, patients will be offered the opportunity to participate in the Optional Extension&#xD;
      Phase until the study terminates or the drug/device becomes commercially available.&#xD;
