  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the performance of the CB-17-08 to help endoscopists find&#xD;
      potential mucosal polyps during the colonoscopy procedure, without significant noise&#xD;
      disturbing the endoscopist attention, nor negative interference with the lesions detection&#xD;
      than with the standard colonoscopy alone: the study will investigate whether the use of the&#xD;
      device provides an increase in the number of adenomas per colonoscopy as compared to standard&#xD;
      colonoscopy. The study will also evaluate the safety of the CB-17-08, assessing if the use of&#xD;
      the system increases the total number of excisions without a commensurate number of adenomas&#xD;
      as compared to standard colonoscopy.&#xD;

      Study procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized (1:1) to one of the arms by an IWRS system. Randomization will be&#xD;
      stratified by study endoscopist, to balance the number of patients randomized to either of&#xD;
      the study groups (1:1) within the same endoscopist, by age (from to 45 to &lt;65 years old; ≥65&#xD;
      years old) and by reason for colonoscopy (screening, surveillance &lt;3 years from previous&#xD;
      colonoscopy, surveillance 3-10 years from previous colonoscopy). Each endoscopist shall not&#xD;
      enrol more than 90 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following study visits are foreseen for each patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Visit A screening visit is performed at the investigational site. During this visit&#xD;
      out-patients scheduled for colonoscopy will be informed about the aims, procedures, benefits&#xD;
      and possible risks of the study prior to signing the informed consent form for inclusion in&#xD;
      the study. Their medical history will be recorded as well as eventual clinical or laboratory&#xD;
      examinations according to the local standard of care preparation for a colonoscopy, ) and the&#xD;
      date for the colonoscopy procedure to be performed at the investigational site will be&#xD;
      scheduled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tandem Colonoscopy Visit Each eligible patient returns to the clinic to undergo a same-day,&#xD;
      back-to-back tandem colonoscopy examination performed by the same experienced endoscopist.&#xD;
      The randomized allocation will determine whether patients will undergo standard&#xD;
      high-definition white light colonoscopy with CB-17-08 immediately followed by standard high&#xD;
      definition white light colonoscopy or standard high definition white light colonoscopy&#xD;
      followed by standard high definition white light colonoscopy with CB-17-08.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bowel preparation will be done according to the usual standard of care protocols of the&#xD;
      individual sites. The quality of bowel preparation will be assessed during colonoscopy using&#xD;
      the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS). Sedation according to the sites best experience&#xD;
      and standard procedures will be delivered to the patient by the endoscopist or an&#xD;
      anaesthesiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects' vital signs (blood pressure [BP], hearth rate [HR] and oxygen saturation [SpO2])&#xD;
      will be measured and monitored prior to, during and at the end of the tandem colonoscopy&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The endoscopist will be instructed to adhere to their usual withdrawal technique and to spend&#xD;
      a minimum of 6 minutes withdrawing and examining the colonic mucosa. Time to reach the caecum&#xD;
      and time to withdrawal from caecum to exit will be recorded for each colonoscopy. Clean&#xD;
      withdrawal time, i.e. withdrawal time excluding the time spent for procedures or washings (if&#xD;
      any), will be recorded. At least 6 minutes of clean withdrawal time will be required for all&#xD;
      colonoscopies, in accordance to the current ASGE guideline. Withdrawal time, total procedure&#xD;
      time, and time for pauses to allow polypectomies and biopsies to be performed will be&#xD;
      recorded. Repeated examination of any of the colon segments (e.g. right colon) in normal&#xD;
      modality or in retroflexion is not permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each colorectal polyp detected during the first procedure, as well as each polyp detected&#xD;
      during the second procedure, will be immediately removed or biopsied and will be sent to the&#xD;
      central histology laboratory for characterization. When a mucosal polyp is detected, its&#xD;
      estimated size and morphological appearance according to Paris classification will be&#xD;
      reported by the endoscopist on the CRF, as well as the anatomical location inside the colonic&#xD;
      districts. On the basis of histological examination, polyps will be categorized according to&#xD;
      revised Vienna classification and serrated lesion classification.&#xD;
