      Evaluate the feasibility of the Liver Incyte system for liver elasticity measurement in&#xD;
      healthy volunteers and patients with liver fibrosis. To evaluate the discriminatory ability&#xD;
      of elasticity measurements generated by Liver Incyte for healthy volunteers versus patients&#xD;
      with liver fibrosis in comparison to FibroScan measurements.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective, open label, feasibility and validation study of the Liver Incyte&#xD;
      system in patients with liver fibrosis (Cohort 1, n = 150) and healthy volunteers (Cohort 2,&#xD;
      n = 50), for a total of 200 participants. The physician operator of the FibroScan, and the&#xD;
      operator of the Shear wave vibro-elastography (S-WAVE) system, will not be blinded to the&#xD;
      clinical diagnoses of the patients. All patients will undergo the testing with both FibroScan&#xD;
      and Liver Incyte system at a single in-clinic visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The liver stiffness of each participant will be assessed with the Liver Incyte Model B device&#xD;
      and with FibroScan. The elasticity measurements from these two devices will be the primary&#xD;
      outcome measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Liver Incyte system is designed as two models with differences in the ultrasound&#xD;
      components only, description of the two models is below. Two sub-studies are included in this&#xD;
      design as exploratory objectives. Model B will be utilized at all study sites and all study&#xD;
      participants. Participants at the LAIR study site will also be evaluated using Model A, as&#xD;
      well as Model B, for verification and to confirm consistency between designs. Participants&#xD;
      will have the option to participate in the Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE) and Proton&#xD;
      Density Fat Fraction (PDFF) portion of the study. MRE/PDFF is an optional procedure, which&#xD;
      makes up a sub-study for this trial, this would require approximately 1 hour, and is open to&#xD;
      any participant who is willing and has time for the extra study visit. The results of the&#xD;
      MRE/PDFF sub-study will be included as an exploratory objective.&#xD;

    <description>The discriminatory ability of elasticity measurements generated by Liver Incyte for healthy volunteers versus patients with liver fibrosis in comparison to FibroScan measurements.&#xD;
An receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve using final Liver Incyte elasticity measurement as a predictor of healthy versus fibrotic (HCV/NASH) will be constructed with accompanying 95% confidence interval for the area under the curve (AUC). The AUC and 95% confidence intervals for the FibroScan device will be calculated.</description>
