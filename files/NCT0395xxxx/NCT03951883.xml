  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Quality nutrient intake is essential for proper development and well-being of children in all&#xD;
      aspects of health, including cognitive development. Eggs are of particular interest based on&#xD;
      potential cognitive and neurological benefits due in part to significant concentrations of&#xD;
      choline and lutein. While overall, choline and lutein have received considerable attention in&#xD;
      the literature in relation to cognition and brain function, most studies involving intake in&#xD;
      young adults have had short intervention periods ranging from 90 minutes to 3 days. Food&#xD;
      insecurity has been associated with decreased academic performance. Given that populations&#xD;
      with food insecurity have limited resources to direct towards nutrition, identifying how a&#xD;
      widely available, highly versatile and largely affordable source of nutrients (i.e. eggs) may&#xD;
      have favorable impacts on cognitive function and brain function will be valuable in informing&#xD;
      public health recommendations in this at-risk population. As such the investigators will&#xD;
      examine whether an increased egg consumption dietary prescription can have positive effects&#xD;
      on functional activity (i.e. fMRI) during an Eriksen-Flanker task, anatomical changes in the&#xD;
      brain (i.e. DTI, MRI), and cognitive abilities as measured by the Stop Signal Reaction Time&#xD;
      task, Operation Span task, Raven's Progressive Matrices and the Boston Naming Task.&#xD;
