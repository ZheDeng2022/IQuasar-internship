      The purpose of this study is to identify pharmacogenetic profiles associated with selective&#xD;
      serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI)-induced behavioral disinhibition in children with Major&#xD;
      depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety disorders and/or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) that&#xD;
      could be used clinically to reduce the incidence of this adverse event and improve health&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;

      Background and Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antidepressants such as serotonin-selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are frequently&#xD;
      prescribed to children to manage major depressive and anxiety disorders. Although SSRIs are&#xD;
      thought to be generally effective and well-tolerated in children, 10%- 20% of children&#xD;
      treated with SSRIs experience behavioral disinhibition (i.e. activation, hyperactivity,&#xD;
      impulsivity, insomnia) that can lead to devastating consequences (e.g. suicidal impulses,&#xD;
      violence). There are currently no tools available to assist healthcare providers in&#xD;
      predicting which children will experience behavioral disinhibition as a result of SSRI&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Do children who experience SSRI-induced behavioral disinhibition (SIBD) have a distinct&#xD;
      pharmacogenetic profile relative to children who do not have these adverse experiences?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a retrospective cohort study design, 120 SSRI-treated children diagnose with major&#xD;
      depression, anxiety and OCD, aged 6 to 17 years of aged will be recruited from Child and&#xD;
      Adolescent Addiction, Mental Health &amp; Psychiatry (CAAMHP) Program in Calgary. Children with a&#xD;
      current or past history of SSRI use will be identified via recruitment advertisements and by&#xD;
      CAAMHP treatment teams operating within community clinics as well as inpatient units within&#xD;
      the Alberta Children's Hospital and Foothills Medical Centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data will be collected from the participant's medical record as well as information&#xD;
      provided by the child's healthcare provider and caretaker using a customized data collection&#xD;
      form. Saliva will be collected, processed and genotyped in accordance with standard&#xD;
      procedures. Participants and their parents will complete self-report measures to gather&#xD;
      information regarding demographics, SIBD, and other adverse side effects and drug reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using machine learning (i.e. the construction of algorithms that can learn from and make&#xD;
      predictions on data) we will identify and validate a panel of genetic variants that could be&#xD;
      used to pre-emptively detect children at-risk for developing SSRI-induced behavioral&#xD;
      disinhibition.&#xD;
