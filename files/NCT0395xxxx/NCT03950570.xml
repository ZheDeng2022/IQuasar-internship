    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the anti-tumor effects of ORIN 1001 in patients with advanced solid&#xD;
      tumors or relapsed refractory metastatic breast cancer (patients with progressive disease&#xD;
      after receiving at least two lines of therapy in the advanced setting).&#xD;

      This is a first in human, Phase 1/2, open label, dose escalation and dose expansion study&#xD;
      that consists of two stages:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: A dose escalation stage to determine the MTD/RP2D of ORIN1001 when given as a single&#xD;
      agent in up to 30 subjects with advanced solid tumors. In addition, a dose escalation stage&#xD;
      to determine the MTD/RP2D of daily ORIN1001 in combination with Abraxane given intravenously&#xD;
      in up to 18 subjects with relapsed refractory metastatic breast cancer (TNBC or ER+ HER2-).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: An expansion stage of ORIN1001 alone (Cohort A: TNBC) and in combination with&#xD;
      Abraxane (Cohort B: Myc+; Cohort C: ER+ HER2-, and Cohort D: TNBC) to estimate efficacy in up&#xD;
      to 120 subjects with relapsed refractory metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
