  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial was designed to investigate the survival outcomes, response rates, and safety of&#xD;
      patients with advanced Head/Neck Squamous cancer by neck artery versus vein infusion of&#xD;
      PD1/PDL1 inhibitor.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Head/Neck cancer is a kind of hard-to-treat malignancy worldwide and its overall survival&#xD;
      rate is still low. PD1/PDL1 inhibitor are widely used to treat various of cancers in China&#xD;
      now. The neck arterial chemotherapy infusion for advanced HNC, through the &quot;first pass&#xD;
      effect&quot; of drug treatment, can significantly increase the local drug concentration of the&#xD;
      tumor, improve the efficacy, and reduce systemic adverse reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the investigator's knowledge, no studies have been developed on the survival benefit of&#xD;
      neck artery infusion of immunotherapeutic agents in patients with advanced HNC. This phase&#xD;
      III clinical trial was designed to compare the effects of PD1/PDL1 inhibitor via IA and IV on&#xD;
      the survival benefit of patients with advanced HNC, including ORR, DCR, median survival time,&#xD;
      and safety.&#xD;

    <description>Overall survival (OS) will be defined as the elapsed time from the enrollment to death from any cause. For surviving patients, follow-up will be censored at the date of last contact (or last date known to be alive). Follow-up for OS will occur every 12 weeks (±1 month) until death or withdrawal of consent from the study.</description>

    <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) will be defined as the elapsed time from the first date of study treatment until documented disease progression (as per mRECIST) or death from any cause, whichever is earlier. For patients who remain alive without progression, follow-up time will be censored at the date of last disease assessment.</description>
