      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of five sessions of cathodal&#xD;
      tDCS over the left DLPFC on inhibitory control/response inhibition in children and&#xD;
      adolescents with ADHD. Investigators hypothesize that multiple sessions of cathodal tDCS will&#xD;
      induce a greater and long-term effect on inhibitory response in children and adolescents with&#xD;
      ADHD.&#xD;

      Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of neural development disorder that&#xD;
      characterized by a persistent pattern of inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity. This&#xD;
      disorder begins in childhood and often lasts into adulthood. Rates of ADHD diagnosis have&#xD;
      been rising in recent years, a prevalence estimates from 3-7% of childhood worldwide. A&#xD;
      recent national prevalence shows that 8.1% of Thai primary school-age children are affected&#xD;
      by ADHD . Pharmacological treatment used in ADHD is well-established, however, each patient&#xD;
      responds to medication differently and treatment in some of them are limited by side effect&#xD;
      and abuse of medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the last decade, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has received a surge of&#xD;
      interest in clinical research since it could modulate cortical excitability and induce&#xD;
      plasticity in human brain. The device sends a constant low direct current (e.g. 1-2 mA)&#xD;
      delivered to the area of interest through the electrodes. This induces shifts in neuronal&#xD;
      resting membrane potential changing cortical excitability. Based on the polarity-specific&#xD;
      effects, anodal tDCS increases cortical excitability and cathodal tDCS decreases cortical&#xD;
      excitability. To change the cortical excitability, tDCS differs from other brain stimulation&#xD;
      techniques such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in that it does not cause action&#xD;
      potentials in cortical neurons, but rather induces shifts in neuronal resting membrane&#xD;
      potential. This is considered to induce a lesser or no risk of a seizure. Given its&#xD;
      advantages such as painlessness, safety, easiness to use, and low-cost, a number of tDCS&#xD;
      studies has been increasing in the last decade particularly in motor rehabilitation and&#xD;
      neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression, autism and schizophrenia with a positive and&#xD;
      safety reports in adult and pediatric populations. Possible after-effect of tDCS has been&#xD;
      also reported in motor and psychological disorders that opens a way to use tDCS as a&#xD;
      therapeutic tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most accepted theory of neural basis of ADHD is deficient of inhibitory control resulting&#xD;
      in executive dysfunction. Inhibitory control or response inhibition is key feature of&#xD;
      self-control and can be defined as ability to inhibit prepotent actions. Several evidences&#xD;
      reveal a physiological association between the prefrontal cortex and its subcortical&#xD;
      connection with the pathophysiology of ADHD. Neuroimaging studies demonstrate that regions of&#xD;
      the right dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) play a role in the inhibition of motor&#xD;
      response. During preforming an inhibitory task that is usually used to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficiency of response inhibition such as stop-signal and go/no-go tasks, this area become&#xD;
      active in healthy individual, while in ADHD showed hypo-activation compared to control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidences showed that the task performance in stop-signal and go/no-go tasks can be&#xD;
      influenced by tDCS application to the DLPFC in healthy subjects. It was recently reported&#xD;
      that a single session of cathodal tDCS, using a single session of 1.5 mA for 15 minutes over&#xD;
      the left DLPFC improved their ability to inhibit themselves by do not response to no-go&#xD;
      stimulus during go/no-go tasks compared to anodal and sham conditions in adolescents with&#xD;
      ADHD. It was postulated that the inter-hemispheric inhibition (IHI) between two regions (left&#xD;
      and right DLPFC) might play a role in this finding. Based on the possibility that cathodal&#xD;
      stimulation decreases excitability and thus IHI drive from the left DLPFC is decreased,&#xD;
      facilitating activity of the right DLPFC where is involved in inhibition of motor response as&#xD;
      demonstrated by neuroimaging studies. Using a single session of oscillatory tDCS during early&#xD;
      sleep, memory consolidation and reaction times in a go/no-go task were improved on the next&#xD;
      day in children with ADHD. This is an argument to explore its possible therapeutic effect in&#xD;
      long-term use. Five tDCS sessions for five consecutive days was reported to be safe and&#xD;
      improves aspect of attention in children and adolescents with ADHD, however, its after-effect&#xD;
      in this population is unknown. In patients with depressive disorder, multiple sessions of&#xD;
      tDCS over the left DLPFC for five or ten days has been demonstrated to decrease depressive&#xD;
      symptoms and lasted for a month. It was reported in patient with depressive disorder that&#xD;
      after five days of tDCS sessions on alternative day did not show an improvement, positive&#xD;
      results was observed after 10 days. This suggests that a longer observation period is&#xD;
      probably required to detect a true tDCS effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of electrophysiological techniques, especially of event-related potentials (ERP)&#xD;
      measured by means of electroencephalography (EEG) allows for analysis of neural change&#xD;
      accompanying inhibitory process in the brain. Two ERP components, the no-go N2 and P3 that&#xD;
      are the most commonly studied in go/no-go tasks have been linked to response conflict and&#xD;
      response inhibition. Studies have reported lower N2 and P3 amplitudes during go/no-go tasks&#xD;
      in children and adolescents with ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To expand current information on tDCS as an emerging treatment for ADHD patients, in this&#xD;
      study, investigators will investigate the effectiveness of multiple sessions of cathodal tDCS&#xD;
      over the left DLPFC on inhibitory control in children and adolescents with ADHD. tDCS&#xD;
      (cathodal/sham) will be applied every day for five consecutive days. Behavioral and&#xD;
      neurophysiological parameters using an inhibitory task (go/no-go tasks) and the no-go N2 and&#xD;
      P3 ERP components will be measured before tDCS, immediately after 5 sessions of tDCS, one&#xD;
      week later, and one month after treatment onset.&#xD;
