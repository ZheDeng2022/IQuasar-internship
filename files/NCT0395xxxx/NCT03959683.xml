  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure how well two different devices work to break up and&#xD;
      remove kidney stones. We are comparing a newer device to an older one to see which one is&#xD;
      faster at breaking up kidney stones. We hypothesize that the Trilogy will increase the stone&#xD;
      clearance rate by 25% compared to the Shockpulse-SE&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Large and complex renal calculi, defined as those with a maximum diameter of â‰¥ 1.5 cm, can be&#xD;
      removed from the upper urinary tract by percutaneous nephrolithotomy but the stones usually&#xD;
      require fragmentation in order to remove them through the access site. There are a number of&#xD;
      commercially available intracorporeal lithotripters used to fragment or break kidney stones&#xD;
      to allow elimination including pneumatic, ultrasonic, and combination devices. Each&#xD;
      technology has its own relative advantages and disadvantages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New versions of intracorporeal lithotripter devices have been introduced with improvements&#xD;
      meant to address prior functional limitations such as probe clogging or breaking and&#xD;
      cumbersome hand piece design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Trilogy lithotrite is the newest generation device stone fragmentation device from Boston&#xD;
      Scientific. The Trilogy device uses unique technology to efficiently fragment and remove&#xD;
      stone material, superior to other devices on the market based on preliminary bench testing.&#xD;
      From Olympus, the ShockPulse-SE Lithotripsy System (Cybersonics, Erie, PA, USA) is a constant&#xD;
      ultrasonic wave energy lithotripter with intermittent shock wave (ballistic/mechanical)&#xD;
      energy. The ShockPulse-SE has a single probe design with an OD of 3.76 mm which allows for&#xD;
      larger sized stone fragments to be vacuumed from the urothelium. The larger, single lumen&#xD;
      also allows for a high flow rate to reduce probe clogging events. The end result is faster&#xD;
      stone clearance rates based on in vitro studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to compare the performance, as measured by the stone clearance&#xD;
      rate at time of percutaneous nephrolithotomy, of the ShockPulse-SE Lithotripsy System to the&#xD;
      Trilogy lithotrite when used for large complex renal calculi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Trilogy has been FDA cleared for fragmentation of urinary tract calculi in the kidney,&#xD;
      ureter, and bladder. Trilogy is a combined piezoelectric/pneumatic device capable of&#xD;
      fragmenting calculi and aspirating stone debris. The novel technology in Trilogy has been&#xD;
      demonstrated in bench testing to more quickly disintegrate stones compared to other devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ShockPulse-SE Lithotripsy System has been FDA cleared fragmentation of urinary tract&#xD;
      calculi in the kidney, ureter, and bladder. The ShockPulse-SE System is an electromechanical&#xD;
      device capable of fragmenting calculi and aspirating stone debris. The novel technology in&#xD;
      the ShockPulse-SE Lithotripsy System uses a single transducer and proprietary ShockPulse&#xD;
      technology to generate both low-frequency mechanical impacts and high-frequency ultrasonic&#xD;
      energy which quickly disintegrates stones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives To compare the performance, as measured by the stone clearance rate at time&#xD;
      of percutaneous nephrolithotomy, of the ShockPulse-SE Lithotripsy System to the Trilogy&#xD;
      Lithotrite.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Endpoints Primary Endpoint Stone clearance rate defined as the kidney stone surface&#xD;
      area measured by preoperative computed tomography (CT) scan divided by the time to remove the&#xD;
      targeted stone burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time to remove the targeted stone burden is measured at time the lithotripter unit starts&#xD;
      fragmenting the stone to time all fragments are removed from the kidney based on visual&#xD;
      inspection. This is prior to final visual inspection of the kidney with a flexible&#xD;
      nephroscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Device malfunctions&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. All complications measured by the Clavien Classification of Surgical Complications Stone&#xD;
           free status as defined by the presence or absence of stone material on postoperative day&#xD;
           1 CT imaging This study is a post-market, prospective, randomized, multicenter, 2-arm,&#xD;
           comparative trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scale and Duration A total of 100 participants will be enrolled and treated at 4 study sites&#xD;
      (3 USA, 1 Canada). Two sites will enroll 16 participants and 2 will enroll at least 18&#xD;
      participants. Each subject will be followed for approximately 6-12 weeks after the study&#xD;
      procedure. It is anticipated for the entire study to last approximately 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Assignment The participants will be block randomized 1:1 to either stone removal&#xD;
      with the Trilogy or the ShockPulse-SE device. All randomization will occur at the central&#xD;
      study site via computer randomization by the statistician to limit selection bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification for the Study Design This study will compare performance of two devices for the&#xD;
      treatment of large renal calculi. The study has been designed as a prospective,&#xD;
      multi-centric, randomized, comparative study. The intent of this design is to minimize bias&#xD;
      and to allow for statistical comparison of the two treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Point of Enrollment A participant will be considered enrolled in the study if they meet all&#xD;
      eligibility criteria and after the participant signs and dates the informed consent form&#xD;
      (ICF). No study-related procedures can take placed until the ICF is signed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal All participants enrolled in the clinical study (including those withdrawn from&#xD;
      the clinical study or lost to follow-up) shall be accounted for and documented. If a&#xD;
      participant withdraws from the clinical investigation, the reason(s) shall be reported. If&#xD;
      such withdrawal is due to problems related to study device safety or performance, the&#xD;
      investigator shall ask for the participant's permission to follow his/her status/condition&#xD;
      outside of the clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reasons for withdrawal include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physician discretion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant choice to withdraw consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lost to follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the participant dies due to any cause&#xD;
&#xD;
      While study withdrawal is discouraged, participants may withdraw from the study at any time,&#xD;
      with or without reason, and without prejudice to further treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If any treated study patient is unable to return to the study center after treatment, efforts&#xD;
      will be made to obtain complete follow-up information from the patient's primary physician.&#xD;
      The reason for a patient's failure to return for the necessary follow-up visits or for a&#xD;
      patient's discontinuance from the study must be determined and recorded in the case report&#xD;
      forms (CRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All applicable CRFs up to the point of participant withdrawal must be completed. Participants&#xD;
      who are &quot;lost to follow up&quot; should have documented attempts to contact them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional data may no longer be collected after the point at which a participant has been&#xD;
      withdrawn from the study or withdraws his/her consent, for whatever reason. Data collected up&#xD;
      to the point of participant withdrawal may be used for study analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed Consent All participants taking part in this clinical study must undergo the&#xD;
      informed consent process. Participants must be allowed adequate time to review the consent,&#xD;
      raise questions, and make a voluntary decision to participate in the clinical study. Each&#xD;
      participant must sign and date the IRB approved informed consent form before any clinical&#xD;
      study-related procedures are performed. A copy of signed informed consent form will be&#xD;
      provided to the participant for his/her records. A participant's participation in the&#xD;
      clinical study begins with the signing and dating of the informed consent form.&#xD;
