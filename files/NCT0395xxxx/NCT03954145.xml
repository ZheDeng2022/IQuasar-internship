  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At the completion of orthodontic treatment, the position of the mandibular canines and&#xD;
      incisors is being maintained on a routine basis by bonding a multi-braided wire retainer onto&#xD;
      their lingual surfaces. One of the adverse events that might occur with time is the debonding&#xD;
      of the wire from one or several lower anterior teeth . This event which can unfortunately get&#xD;
      unnoticed by the patient can lead to unwanted tooth displacement. When the practionner&#xD;
      detects such a debonding, he has to go through a laborious and lengthy procedure to rebond&#xD;
      the wire. When on the other hand the patient notices himself such a debonding, he is to call&#xD;
      in emergency his practitioner to get his retainer repaired. This leads to emergency visits&#xD;
      that are susceptible to affect adversely his timetable. The prevalence of these bonding&#xD;
      failures is estimated at 37% at 18 month follow-ups. It has been reported that with prior&#xD;
      enamel sandblasting, bonding failure rate is reduced to 8% at 24 month follow-ups. However,&#xD;
      no study has reported yet the debonding rate of lower fixed, comparing wires that have been&#xD;
      bonded after prior enamel pumicing to those that were put in place after prior enamel&#xD;
      sandblasting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected result of this trial is a significantly decrease in bonding failure rate of&#xD;
      mandibular lingual retainer when enamel surfaces are initially sandblasted compared to the&#xD;
      ones which are pumiced. This reduction would lower the risk of unwanted tooth movement of&#xD;
      mandibular incisors and canines after orthodontic treatment and decrease the number of&#xD;
      emergency appointments for the patient and the practitioner.&#xD;
