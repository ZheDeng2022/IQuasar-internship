      Background: There is a need for projects that link work closer to the rehabilitation chain to&#xD;
      further understand risk factors for sick-leave. The new aspect of this project is that it&#xD;
      combines work place intervention with individualized physiotherapy, based on validated&#xD;
      standardized tests and a classification based treatment system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: The aim is to expand the knowledge and understanding of complex causes of&#xD;
      musculoskeletal pain, particularly low back pain (LBP). The main aim is to examine if&#xD;
      cognitive functional therapy (CFT) can further reduce sick-leave and pain, and increase&#xD;
      function and well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods: To ensure good recruitment we have collaboration with the Department&#xD;
      for Health and social services in the county of Bergen, which has a sickness absence above&#xD;
      average among their health workers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will invite those with LBP problems to be included in an RCT and receive CFT in a&#xD;
      physiotherapy clinic (usually offered 5 to 12 visits). The comparison group will receive a&#xD;
      series with cognitive patient education and physiotherapy (COPE-PT) given by a&#xD;
      physiotherapist. All participants will be followed by their workplace leaders. All patients&#xD;
      who enter the RCT will be re-examined at 3 and 12 months and the predictors for sick-leave,&#xD;
      function and coping in different sub-groups of patients with NSLBP will be studied.&#xD;

      Musculoskeletal complaints: Function, activity and work&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Introduction and relevance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Causes of sick-leave are multidimensional, and even if a sick-listed person has physical pain&#xD;
      and/or functional problems, treatment models that focus only on these aspects are often not&#xD;
      successful. In fact a sole focus on physical impairment may even medicalize the problem and&#xD;
      increase a person's dependency on care professionals. Current knowledge suggests it is&#xD;
      necessary to combine cognitive, functional and organizational strategies which include the&#xD;
      workplace leader in order to reduce sick-leave absence. High quality clinical studies set in&#xD;
      a Norwegian workplace that take all these aspects into consideration are scarce, and there is&#xD;
      a need for research in which multiple dimensions are integrated in the management of persons&#xD;
      who are, or are about to become sick-listed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Musculoskeletal complaints and particularly non-specific low back pain (NSLBP) is a common&#xD;
      reason for sick-leave in Norway. Risk profiling and stratification of workers with NSLBP is&#xD;
      central in this project. Differences in functional capacity and requirements, particularly at&#xD;
      work and in activities of daily living, means that workers with similar medical diagnoses may&#xD;
      need different treatments. This research project proposes a several stages process. In the&#xD;
      first stage, those workers who become sick-listed, or who are on the brink of becoming so,&#xD;
      due to musculoskeletal complaints, including NSLBP, will be closely supported by specially&#xD;
      trained workplace leaders with a focus on preventing medicalization of the problem and&#xD;
      promoting activity. It is a legal responsibility for every workplace in Norway to take care&#xD;
      of workers with health problems, but this has in many work-places not been optimized. In the&#xD;
      next stage those who have musculoskeletal complaints will be invited to undergo a functional&#xD;
      evaluation 4 weeks after their first day of sick-leave or start of their complaint. This&#xD;
      functional evaluation can be used in the communication between the patient, their work leader&#xD;
      and/or their primary health caretaker. Those with LBP will be invited to test an intervention&#xD;
      model that builds on recent knowledge about sub-classification of NSLBP to reduce sick-leave,&#xD;
      improve function and coping. This treatment is called cognitive functional therapy (CFT),&#xD;
      will be tested in a randomized, controlled trial (RCT). There will be a comparison group in&#xD;
      the RCT who will get a series with cognitive patient education and physiotherapy (COPE-PT) by&#xD;
      specially trained physiotherapists. All participants will be followed by their work leaders.&#xD;
      To enhance understanding about the causes and mechanisms of sick-leave, and to understand&#xD;
      workers experience of treatments as well as the work leaders experience of the educational&#xD;
      courses and their use of the functional evaluation, a parallel qualitative process evaluation&#xD;
      will take place. The project intends to increase our knowledge of risk factors for sickness&#xD;
      absence and how to improve the communication between the patient, their workplace and&#xD;
      caretakers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 Stratification of back pain has received increased attention the last few years. There is&#xD;
      increasing evidence that interventions based on a multidimensional understanding of patients&#xD;
      with back- and pelvic related problems allowing more targeted intervention and can have&#xD;
      implications for the treatment effect (Main &amp; Watson 1996; O'Sullivan 1997; Linton 2000;&#xD;
      Skouen et al. 2002; Fritz et al. 2003; Fersum et al. 2009). It is important that the&#xD;
      multidimensional intervention takes place within a bio-psycho-social perspective, enabling&#xD;
      targeted intervention towards the underlying mechanisms of pain and disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive patient education (COPE) for patients with musculoskeletal pain problems, including&#xD;
      LBP, has for the last few years become an element, either alone or as part of&#xD;
      multidisciplinary pain programs (Moseley et al. 2004; Werner et al 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Methods and material&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a RCT for patients with NSLBP. Those with remaining LBP complaints at this&#xD;
      stage will be randomized to either targeted cognitive functional therapy (CFT) intervention&#xD;
      taking place in a physiotherapy clinic or to a comparison group with cognitive patient&#xD;
      education and physiotherapy (COPE-PT). All will be followed by their workplace leader at&#xD;
      their individual workplace.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      RCT study: Persons with 4-8 weeks of sick-leave and/or who has remaining NSLBP at this stage:&#xD;
      Do workers receiving cognitive functional therapy (CFT) combined with workplace intervention,&#xD;
      have reduced sick-leave, improved function and coping, compared to those receiving cognitive&#xD;
      patient education and physiotherapy (COPE-PT), in combination with workplace intervention, at&#xD;
      3 and 12 months after the intervention?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material, design and outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive functional therapy (CFT) compared to cognitive patient education and physiotherapy&#xD;
      (COPE-PT) for patients with non-specific chronic low back pain (NSCLBP):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with NSCLBP will be recruited as part of another study related to the FAkta&#xD;
      project. Before randomization all patients will be examined with standardized tests as well&#xD;
      as with a short walking test with the use of an accelerometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Workers with NSLBP will be randomized to either CFT (O'Sullivan, 2000, 2005) or to a&#xD;
      comparison group with COPE-PT. All participants will be followed by their workplace leaders.&#xD;
      Persons who randomly are allocated to either the CFT intervention group or comparison group&#xD;
      COPE-PT will be offered treatment by specially trained physiotherapists at a physiotherapy&#xD;
      clinic, based on the multidimensional understanding of their complaints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: The primary outcome measure in the RCT is sick-leave, measured by number of&#xD;
      days absence from work. The participants in this study will, in addition to the&#xD;
      questionnaires mentioned above, have the the Roland Morris questionnaire as secondary outcome&#xD;
      measure. The project will start at the beginning of 2012, and persons will be included until&#xD;
      the end of 2013, with the last follow-up at the end of 2014.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation: In a former study (Steenstra et al. 2006) where a similar model for&#xD;
      workplace intervention was evaluated, an average of 100 days (SD=96.0) of sick-leave was&#xD;
      found for back patients who received intervention, compared to 130 days (SD=70.0) in those&#xD;
      who received treatment-as-usual. A sample size of 123 participants in each group gives a&#xD;
      power of 80 % to detect an effect of this magnitude with significance level at 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, a recent power calculation based on the recent results from Fersum et al. (2013)&#xD;
      where CFT was compared to manual therapy indicate that it should be sufficient with 30&#xD;
      participants in each group. The results have still not been published internationally, but&#xD;
      measured in effect size (ES), the difference between the new CFT compared to today's usual&#xD;
      practice with manual therapy and exercise was around 1 ES on most measures, in favor of the&#xD;
      CB-CFT, reflecting both a statistical and clinical significant difference. The participant in&#xD;
      this new study will, however, probably have more problems compared to the previous RCT. This&#xD;
      has enabled us to aim for intervention group and one comparison group with at least 50, but&#xD;
      hopefully close to 70 in each group. This sample size will give adequate power to detect&#xD;
      sick-leave differences of this magnitude, even allowing for a substantial attrition rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Personal resources in the study : All PTs that will take part in study will receive an&#xD;
      instructional course covering subjects like work life, optimal cognitive approach for the&#xD;
      patients, and strategies to ensure optimal co-operation between the workplace and the worker.&#xD;
      Three of these experienced therapists will have specialized training in the CFT intervention,&#xD;
      which they have already utilized in participation in a similar, recent RCT. The 4-5 PTs in&#xD;
      the second intervention group will not be familiar with CFT, but they will receive much&#xD;
      training in cognitive coping techniques after the COPE-PT LBP trial principles (Werner et al.&#xD;
      2010). The educational part of the COPE-PT for new instructors with a PT background takes 2&#xD;
      days supervised by Werner and his group, with regular follow-up meeting with the project&#xD;
      leaders, together with a psychologist trained in cognitive therapy (Minna Hynninen).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CFT is adjusted to the individual, with minimum duration of 45 minutes each session, and&#xD;
      4 - 8 treatments during a period of 8 - 12 weeks (average 7-8 treatments). Follow-up will&#xD;
      take place after the intervention period (at 3 months) and will include a physical&#xD;
      examination and questionnaires. The next follow-up will be at 12 months and by questionnaires&#xD;
      only. The participants in COPE-PT will receive one weekly session 4 times, and the follow-up&#xD;
      examination will also be at 3 and 12 months, similar to the CFT group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The person in charge of the RCT is researcher Kjartan Vibe Fersum, who will assist in the&#xD;
      project co-ordination and CFT treatment. Alice Kvåle will together with the research fellow&#xD;
      Tove Ask be an assessor of all patients who enter the project at 4-6 weeks. Only Kvåle will&#xD;
      do the re-examination at 3 months of patients who have entered the RCT and she will be&#xD;
      blinded for group belonging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Organization, budget and relevance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project management, organisation and cooperation The Physiotherapy research group, unit for&#xD;
      Musculoskeletal complaints, at the Department of Public Health and Primary Health Care,&#xD;
      University of Bergen (UiB) is responsible for managing and organizing the project, in&#xD;
      cooperation with the Department of Health- and Social Services at Bergen County. This&#xD;
      department has documented above average sick-leave among their health service employees, and&#xD;
      both the management and the political leaders of the department aim to reduce this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Budget This project has got Nkr. 4.700.000,- from the Norwegian Fund for Postgraduate&#xD;
      Training in Physiotherapy to cover expenses for Kjartan Vibe Fersum and Tove Ask in the time&#xD;
      period 2011 to 2015. Other resources are either part of our research positions at UiB or have&#xD;
      been/will be applied for. Details are found in Appendix IV. The Department of Health and&#xD;
      Social Services at Bergen County has agreed to let the workplace leaders and union leaders&#xD;
      have paid leave when participating in the education courses and/or in the focus group&#xD;
      interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compliance with strategic documents At the Department of Public Health and Primary Health&#xD;
      Care, UiB, we have many resource persons who have musculoskeletal pain as their major area of&#xD;
      interest, which is reflected both in the departments' research and teaching. One major goal&#xD;
      is to further enhance knowledge and understanding regarding the complex causes and mechanisms&#xD;
      of musculoskeletal pain and disability, as well as to examine the effect of a targeted&#xD;
      functional approach in combination with focus on the workplace, evaluated both on the&#xD;
      individual and the societal level. Part of this project aims to identify subgroups of workers&#xD;
      with non-specific low back pain who just have been sick-listed or who are about to be so.&#xD;
      This allows workers to be classified in such a way that they will respond to targeted&#xD;
      treatment and get substantial improved effect of the intervention in comparison to what is&#xD;
      usual today. The project will be performed in close co-operation with the Department of&#xD;
      Health and Social Services, Bergen County.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance to society In a recent reform for interaction between the municipalities and&#xD;
      secondary health services in Norway (&quot;Samhandlingsreformen&quot; 2010), the importance of&#xD;
      increased focus on health promotion and rehabilitation within the local councils has been&#xD;
      underlined. A more efficient system of management and treatment within the primary health&#xD;
      care system should prevent more extensive and chronic complaints. Recognition of the early&#xD;
      signs and risk factors of musculoskeletal complaints in a bio-psycho-social perspective in&#xD;
      different subgroups of workers is of great importance. Health promotion and rehabilitative&#xD;
      measures must recognize the different needs of different groups (&quot;Rett behandling, på rett&#xD;
      sted, til rett tid&quot; - Jfr. St.m.47). Effective communication between the worker, the&#xD;
      workplace and the treating PTs/MTs in the municipality are central. The workers who are&#xD;
      recruited to the project are themselves all workers within the Department of Health and&#xD;
      Social Services. Their work is often quite physically demanding, and they have an above&#xD;
      average percentage of sick-leave. It is challenging to try to improve function in workers&#xD;
      with heavy workloads in order to reduce sick-leave, for the benefit of the individual and for&#xD;
      society.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is likely to have important consequences regarding how workers at risk are cared&#xD;
      for in the workplace, potentially highlighting the need for the right actions to the right&#xD;
      time. The results of this study may lead to better interaction between health personnel (here&#xD;
      mainly PTs/MTs), the work place and the occupational health services. The RCT will clarify&#xD;
      whether classification based CFT results in greater improvements in function and working&#xD;
      ability, than treatment-as-usual. The qualitative part of the project will give insight into&#xD;
      the mechanisms for sick-leave, and give additional information as far as aspects that can be&#xD;
      improved in to enhance workplaces effectiveness in dealing with musculoskeletal complaints,&#xD;
      especially with reference to workers with back problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Environmental perspectives By means of the RCT the aim is to test if the new treatment model&#xD;
      of CFT combined with focus on the workplace, will lead to improved function and less sickness&#xD;
      absence, in comparison to a cognitive treatment strategy without hands-on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Ethics&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical aspects There is no harm related to participation in the project. The participants&#xD;
      will get written and verbal information about the project via their workplace leader (head&#xD;
      nurse/department leader). Pamphlets will also be distributed with information at the&#xD;
      different workplaces. Interested participants with musculoskeletal complaints will then&#xD;
      directly book an appointment. An informed consent will be made separately for Study II, and a&#xD;
      new one for Study III and IV. According to current rules and regulations regarding&#xD;
      responsibility for employees, each work place should maintain regular contact with&#xD;
      sick-listed workers and try to include them at work (&quot;Avtale om Inkluderende arbeidsliv&quot;).&#xD;
      The additional part will be to fill in questionnaires and agree to a physical examination 4-6&#xD;
      weeks later. Participants will, when included into the RCT in Study III, be asked if they&#xD;
      want to take part in the focus group interviews in Study IV. An application for the complete&#xD;
      project will be sent to Regional Ethical Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gender equality and gender perspectives More women than men are working in health care and&#xD;
      have a higher percentage of sick-leave, although both gender will be invited to participate.&#xD;
      The project will focus on identifying mechanisms for sick-leave absence in a&#xD;
      bio-psycho-social perspective, and the gender perspective, both organizational and physical,&#xD;
      will be focused on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. Communication with users and utilization of results&#xD;
&#xD;
      Communication with users Central users in this project are health workers in the primary&#xD;
      health care system and representatives from them have been involved in planning of the&#xD;
      project and will continue to be so. The research results will be mediated in meetings with&#xD;
      the work group leaders and head nurses and in courses arranged for the employees. The&#xD;
      workplace leaders will meet the research team and the appointed course instructors to&#xD;
      exchange experience several times throughout the project period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dissemination plan The research material will be analyzed and disseminated in articles&#xD;
      published in relevant, national and international referee based journals. Furthermore,&#xD;
      information will be disseminated by courses and lectures to health workers employed in&#xD;
      primary health care facilities, as well as to physiotherapists/manual therapists working in&#xD;
      physiotherapy clinics, based on the results of the different studies. It is anticipated that&#xD;
      the workplace contacts will continue for workers at risk for becoming sick-listed also after&#xD;
      the project has ended, if the study has shown positive results.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention is a targeted cognitive functional therapy and will be based on examination findings. It is behaviorally directed with a focus on normalizing mal-adaptive pain, cognitive and movement behaviors in a graduated manner. In the evaluation process it is considered whether the patient has adjusted to the back complaints in a positive way (confrontation, active coping, minimal avoidance behavior) or in a negative way (passive coping, fear and avoidance behavior). Work related issues will be a particular focus, with the aim of achieving close co-operation between the worker, the workplace and the worker's responsible health care provider.</description>
