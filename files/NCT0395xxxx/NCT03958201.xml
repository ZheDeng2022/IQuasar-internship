  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that the investigators can reduce residual&#xD;
      paralysis to a very low incidence, and that the investigators can do this while preserving a&#xD;
      role for the older and less expensive reversal agent neostigmine. The investigators consider&#xD;
      this an evidence-based approach because previous reports clearly indicate that neostigmine is&#xD;
      effective for reversal of the most shallow neuromuscular blocks, a level of block now&#xD;
      referred to as minimal block. The Investigators also know from previous data that a&#xD;
      substantial proportion of patients have minimal block. Sugammadex will be used when the block&#xD;
      to be reversed is deeper than minimal, specifically when the objectively measured TOF-ratio&#xD;
      is &lt;40%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that this protocol will be associated with an incidence of&#xD;
      residual paralysis of less than 3%. The investigators plan is to study 200 patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study implements a standardized protocol for NMBD (neuromuscular blocking drug)&#xD;
      management that is currently used by some providers at UWMC and HMC to help prevent residual&#xD;
      paralysis in surgical patients. While this protocol is within the scope of routine care that&#xD;
      an anesthesiologist could follow in his/her clinical practice, it is not consistently used&#xD;
      throughout HMC and UWMC. This protocol follows clinical best practices for NMBD management in&#xD;
      a surgical population and adheres to the recommendations from the P&amp;T committee on reversal&#xD;
      drug choice and recommendations from the Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine on&#xD;
      neostigmine dosing. While this protocol is in line with best practices, the investigators are&#xD;
      continuing to systematically evaluate it in the setting of prospective research. All drugs&#xD;
      will be administered for clinical care only. This research does not add additional&#xD;
      medications. The study will take place at UWMC and HMC and will follow a standardized&#xD;
      research protocol for the timing, dosing, and monitoring surrounding muscle relaxants and&#xD;
      reversal, and makes use of objective TOF monitors. If a patient agrees to participate in this&#xD;
      study, the following research protocol will occur:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before Surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. TOF measurements before surgery: A study investigator will perform the routine clinical&#xD;
           train-of-four measurements with an objective monitor at baseline after the clinical&#xD;
           induction of general anesthesia but before the administration of the NMBD. Information&#xD;
           will be recorded for research purposes. Research staff will leave the operating room&#xD;
           after obtaining the baseline measurement and will return to the operating room at the&#xD;
           end of the surgical procedure, to be available for TOF ratio measurements at the time&#xD;
           that reversal of paralysis is planned as well as for the primary outcome measurement,&#xD;
           i.e. at time of extubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Dose calculation of initial NMBD: A study investigator will assist the anesthesia&#xD;
           provider with calculation of the recommended intubating dose of rocuronium (an NMBD).&#xD;
           The dose will be calculated per this research protocol based on Ideal Body Weight (IBW).&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. For women 45.5 kg plus 2.3 kg/inch over 5 feet of height&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. For men 50 kg plus 2.3 kg/inch over 5 feet of height.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. For routine intubations, the recommended dose for intubation will be a maximum of&#xD;
                Rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. The intubating dose will be reduced by 15% for females.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Higher intubating dose may be used at the discretion of the anesthesia provider&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Additional dose calculation of NMBD: Each additional dose of rocuronium will be 25% of the&#xD;
      recommended intubating dose and will be administered when the TOF count has returned to at&#xD;
      least 2, the aim is to maintain an intraoperative TOF count of 1-2 unless the anesthesia&#xD;
      provider has deemed deep paralysis to be necessary in which case a TOF count of 0 will be&#xD;
      maintained. An attempt will be made to avoid administration of rocuronium during the last 30&#xD;
      minutes of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After Surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients will receive reversal drugs for their routine care that will help reverse the&#xD;
           effects of their muscle relaxant. In this study, the decision of reversal drug use will&#xD;
           follow institutional guidelines. The timing and dose calculation of the reversal drug&#xD;
           will follow the research protocol as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Timing of neostigmine or sugammadex: Based on the results of the clinical pre-reversal&#xD;
           TOF assessment, reversal with neostigmine will be administered if the objective&#xD;
           TOF-ratio is between 40%-90%. If the block is deeper than this, then sugammadex will be&#xD;
           used for reversal (This is per institutional guidance on choice of reversal drug).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Dose calculation of neostigmine and sugammadex: For this study, the dose of neostigmine&#xD;
           will be calculated based on the IBW. The dose of sugammadex will be calculated based on&#xD;
           patients' actual body weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For all subjects enrolled in this study, the investigators will follow a dose schedule&#xD;
           which is based on clinical TOF monitoring and is in accordance with institutional&#xD;
           recommendations for dosing of neostigmine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Timing of extubation: The patient's trachea will not be extubated before routine&#xD;
           objective monitoring confirms recovery to a TOF-ratio 90%. However, in the case that&#xD;
           objective monitoring cannot be obtained by the provider then the following will happen:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. For subjects who receive neostigmine for their routine care, it is recommended that&#xD;
                the patient's trachea will not be extubated earlier than 10 minutes after the&#xD;
                administration of this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. For subjects who receive sugammadex for routine care, it is recommended that the&#xD;
                patient's trachea will not be extubated earlier than 3 minutes after drug&#xD;
                administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. TOF measurements after surgery (extubation): The TOF-ratio will be measured by a study&#xD;
           investigator or provider at the time of extubation. Information will be recorded for&#xD;
           research purposes. If the investigators miss obtaining research measurements at the time&#xD;
           of extubation, they will obtain TOF measurements on the patient's arrival to the PACU.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Collection of data from EMR: the investigators will collect information from the&#xD;
           patient's medical record including the intraoperative TOF counts, ASA class, surgical&#xD;
           procedure, times of the surgical procedure, time and dose of administered medications,&#xD;
           and the patient's temperature in the operating room and PACU.&#xD;
