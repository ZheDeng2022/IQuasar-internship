  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex disease whose evaluation in daily practice&#xD;
      and clinical research requires consideration of several aspects, in particular disease&#xD;
      activity and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health systems are increasingly using Patient Reported Outcome measures (PRO) data to measure&#xD;
      different dimensions of the disease and its experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, there is a growing number of &quot;e-health&quot; tools for patients. Indeed, the&#xD;
      collection of health-related data via an electronic system makes it possible to modernise and&#xD;
      facilitate communication between patients and doctors within the framework of medical&#xD;
      follow-up and therapeutic education. Nevertheless, very few studies measure the acceptability&#xD;
      and effective long-term use of such tools, particularly in the context of SLE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Sanoïa patient platform is a digital tool already used in therapeutic areas similar to&#xD;
      SLE (discoid lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis), offering a guarantee of safety&#xD;
      and a reduced individual cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The availability of this health-related quality of life data collection tool via a site and a&#xD;
      mobile application adapted to patients with SLE should:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Facilitate the collection by patients of their quality of life as part of their routine&#xD;
           follow-up (patient access)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Limit the impact of patients' clinical profiles on the frequency of the collection of&#xD;
           quality of life data&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Enable internal medicine specialists to systematically use their patients' quality of&#xD;
           life data during consultation (physician access).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study therefore proposes to evaluate this digital platform within the framework of SLE&#xD;
      by measuring the distribution of access by physicians according to the data reported by&#xD;
      patients and according to the characteristics of the facilities where the subjects were&#xD;
      recruited for the study. These data will allow us to evaluate the influence of factors&#xD;
      extrinsic to patients on the adoption of the tool. This area has been very poorly evaluated&#xD;
      in the few studies that have focused on the adoption of such tools.&#xD;
