  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 open-label study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a neoantigen&#xD;
      peptide vaccine strategy in pancreatic cancer patients following surgical resection and&#xD;
      adjuvant chemotherapy. The neoantigen peptide vaccines will incorporate prioritized&#xD;
      neoantigens and personalized mesothelin epitopes and will be co-administered with poly-ICLC.&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this study is that neoantigen peptide vaccines will be safe and capable of&#xD;
      generating measurable neoantigen-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell responses.&#xD;

             might make it difficult for the patient to complete the full course of treatments or&#xD;
             to generate an immune response to vaccines. In the case of asthma or chronic&#xD;
             obstructive pulmonary disease taking inhaled corticosteroids that does not require&#xD;
             daily systemic corticosteroids is acceptable. Additionally, local acting steroids&#xD;
             (topical, inhaled, or intraarticular) will be allowed. Patients on intermittent or&#xD;
             short course steroids will be allow if the dose does not exceed 4 mg of dexamethasone&#xD;
             (or equivalent) per day for &gt; 7 consecutive days. Any patients receiving steroids&#xD;
             should be discussed with the PI to determine if eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant and/or breastfeeding.&#xD;
