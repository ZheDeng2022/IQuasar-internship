  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prolonged mechanical ventilation (MV) is associated with significant adverse effects in&#xD;
      newborn infants and clinicians aim at its minimum possible duration. Failed extubation and&#xD;
      need for reintubation is common and further prolongs the duration of MV. Hence, accurate&#xD;
      prediction of readiness for extubation would incur a considerable reduction in respiratory&#xD;
      morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Spontaneous breathing Trial (SBT) involves placing the infant on endotracheal continuous&#xD;
      positive airway pressure for five minutes with continuous monitoring of heart rate and oxygen&#xD;
      saturation levels. The infant would pass the test if there is no hypoxia or bradycardia&#xD;
      during the trial. A successful SBT might predict successful extubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The respiratory muscles play a crucial role in successful extubation. One simple way to&#xD;
      quantify respiratory muscle function is the rate of relaxation of the inspiratory muscles&#xD;
      that can be depicted by the rate of the decline of the airway pressure signal following a&#xD;
      spontaneous breath.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of the investigator is that respiratory muscle function assessment using the&#xD;
      rate of relaxation of the inspiratory muscles during a SBT can accurately predict extubation&#xD;
      outcomes either independently or in conjunction with the outcome of the SBT and the&#xD;
      variability of the respiratory parameters during the SBT. This could increase the predicting&#xD;
      accuracy of extubation outcomes and thus reduce re-intubation associated respiratory&#xD;
      morbidity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prolonged endotracheal mechanical ventilation has significant adverse effects in newborn&#xD;
      infants including subglottic stenosis, bacterial colonisation and bronchopulmonary dysplasia.&#xD;
      Neonatal health professionals aim to limit the period of mechanical ventilation to the&#xD;
      minimum possible duration. The decision to extubate is commonly a clinical one, based on&#xD;
      current ventilator settings, blood gases analysis and the overall clinical condition of the&#xD;
      infant. On the other hand, newborn infants commonly fail extubation and require reintubation&#xD;
      which is a traumatic invasive procedure which could further prolong the total duration of&#xD;
      invasive mechanical ventilation. Thus, accurate prediction of readiness for extubation&#xD;
      outcome will probably incur a notable reduction in respiratory morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of studies have evaluated methods to predict extubation outcome. Of them, the&#xD;
      spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) has been shown to hold the highest predictive value: it&#xD;
      involves placing an infant from invasive mechanical pressure limited time cycled ventilation&#xD;
      ventilation to endotracheal continuous positive end-expiratory pressure (ET-CPAP) for a&#xD;
      period of 5 minutes during which saturation and heart rate are closely monitored. The infant&#xD;
      would pass the test if there is no hypoxia or bradycardia during the test. A successful SBT&#xD;
      has a positive predictive value of 93%, sensitivity of 97% and specificity of 73%. The&#xD;
      combination of a successful SBT with increased variability in respiratory parameters during&#xD;
      the SBT has been reported to further increase the sensitivity of the trial; alas the&#xD;
      specificity remains below 75%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It should be noted that at King's College Hospital the SBT forms part of routine clinical&#xD;
      care as per clinical guideline and it is at the discretion of the attending physician to&#xD;
      conduct the trial prior to extubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The work of breathing is undertaken by the respiratory muscles. Impaired respiratory muscle&#xD;
      function is associated with a higher risk of respiratory muscle fatigue and respiratory&#xD;
      failure and need for mechanical ventilation. Respiratory muscle function has been identified&#xD;
      as an independent predictor of extubation outcome in mechanically ventilated infants. One&#xD;
      simple way to quantify respiratory muscle function is the rate of relaxation of the&#xD;
      inspiratory muscles which can be depicted by the rate of the decline of the airway pressure&#xD;
      signal following a spontaneous breath. In concept, inefficient muscle function is manifested&#xD;
      by a more gradual drop to baseline of the airway pressure over time. The principle on which&#xD;
      the method is based is that when skeletal muscles contract against increased external loads,&#xD;
      their relaxation slows as a result of slower calcium uptake by skeletal muscle fibres. In&#xD;
      terms of physical properties, fatigued muscle fibres take longer to relax after contraction&#xD;
      and this reduction in the relaxation rate can be quantified by an increase in the time&#xD;
      constant of relaxation and a decrease in the maximal relaxation rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rate of relaxation of the inspiratory muscles has been shown to accurately describe&#xD;
      respiratory muscle function in non-neonatal populations. The information on the inspiratory&#xD;
      muscle rate of relaxation is readily available in the ventilator graphics which, as part of&#xD;
      routine clinical care, use a pressure port and a flow sensor to record airway flow, delivered&#xD;
      volume and pressure over time. To the knowledge of the investigator, the potential value of&#xD;
      this information in predicting extubation outcome in newborn infants has not been explored to&#xD;
      date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Typically, respiratory muscle dysfunction would occur in premature infants owing to&#xD;
      immaturity, decreased muscle mass and prematurity-associated co-morbidities. Furthermore&#xD;
      infants with Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH) and Anterior Wall Defects (AWD) such as&#xD;
      gastroschisis and exomphalos, have also been reported to have impaired respiratory muscle&#xD;
      function which could probably preclude timely successful extubation. King's College Hospital&#xD;
      provides care for a large number of infants with CDH and AWD while also has a long tradition&#xD;
      in the assessment of respiratory muscle function in infants making it the ideal site to&#xD;
      recruit infants with CDH and AWD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of the investigator is that respiratory muscle function assessment using the&#xD;
      rate of relaxation of the inspiratory muscles during SBT can accurately predict extubation&#xD;
      outcome. This prediction might stand independently for the rate of relaxation or in&#xD;
      conjunction with SBT-derived respiratory function parameters such as the outcome of the SBT&#xD;
      and the variability of respiratory parameters during the SBT. An integrated algorithm&#xD;
      incorporating respiratory muscle function data could thus be produced. This would be&#xD;
      validated in a large cohort and could increase the prediction accuracy of extubation outcome&#xD;
      and thus reduce re-intubation associated respiratory morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a prospective, observational cohort study. Aims of the study are to measure the&#xD;
      rate of relaxation, airway flow, airway pressure, tidal volume and transcutaneous oxygen&#xD;
      saturation in all planned extubations over the coming 12 months in the neonatal unit at&#xD;
      King's College Hospital. Data to be recorded include basic epidemiologic parameters such as&#xD;
      gestation at birth, birth weight, corrected gestational age at measurement, day of life,&#xD;
      weight at measurement, blood gas parameters within 6 hours of the SBT and associated&#xD;
      co-morbidities that might impact on the success of the SBT such as open ductus arteriosus and&#xD;
      current evidence of infection. Infants with known genetic or chromosomal abnormalities,&#xD;
      infants with congenital anomalies other than CDH or AWD and infants with focal acute lung&#xD;
      pathology such as atelectasis or pneumothorax will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the unit's activity over the past two chronological years, the investigators&#xD;
      anticipate that with a successful consent rate of 80% it will be possible to measure 100&#xD;
      infants in total: 40 premature infants, 40 term infants and 20 infants with CDH and AWD. As&#xD;
      this is a novel index, direct power calculation cannot be undertaken before the commencement&#xD;
      of the study. An interim power calculation based on pilot data will be conducted half way&#xD;
      through the project at six months, to determine the required sample size. The investigators&#xD;
      believe however, that given that previous studies with similar outcome measures incorporated&#xD;
      significantly smaller numbers of participants, the achieved sample size will be sufficient&#xD;
      for the objectives of the study to be achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inform written consent will be requested from the parents or legal guardians of the infants&#xD;
      and the attending Neonatal Consultant will be requested to assent to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the clinical team decides an infant is ready for extubation, the investigator will&#xD;
      switch the ventilator to ET-CPAP at the same pressure as the positive end expiratory pressure&#xD;
      during mechanical ventilation. Airflow, integrated tidal volume and airway pressure will be&#xD;
      recorded with the NM3 respiratory function monitor (Philips Respironics, Connecticut, USA).&#xD;
      The monitor will be connected to a Laptop (Dell Latitude, Dell, Bracknell, UK) with&#xD;
      customised Spectra software (3.0.1.4) (Grove Medical, London, UK). The NM3 respiratory&#xD;
      profile monitor has a combined pressure, flow and carbon dioxide sensor and this will be&#xD;
      placed in line between the inspiratory limb of the ventilator circuit and the endotracheal&#xD;
      tube. The NM3 monitor is automatically calibrated for flow and pressure. Flow will be&#xD;
      measured using a fixed orifice pneumotachograph. One of the tubes from the pneumotachograph&#xD;
      will be connected to a second pressure transducer to measure airway pressure. Oxygen&#xD;
      saturation and heart rate monitoring will also be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A failed SBT will be recorded if the infant has either a bradycardia for more than 15 seconds&#xD;
      and/or a fall in SpO2 below 85% despite a 15% increase in FIO2. At this point the study will&#xD;
      be stopped and ventilation will be restarted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants will be extubated to either nasal CPAP or high flow nasal cannula oxygen at the&#xD;
      clinician's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study outcome will be reintubation within 72 hours of extubation. The indications&#xD;
      for reintubation will be: (a) more than six episodes of apnoea requiring stimulation in six&#xD;
      hours, or more than one significant episode of apnoea requiring bag and mask ventilation; (b)&#xD;
      respiratory acidosis: PaCO2 &gt;8.5 kPa and pH,7.25; (c)FIO2&gt;0.60 to maintain SpO2 in the range&#xD;
      of 90-95%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the infant has either bradycardia for more than 15 seconds and/or a fall in SpO2 below 85%&#xD;
      despite a 15% increase in FIO2, the study will be stopped and ventilation will be restarted.&#xD;
      Strict infection control policies will be followed according to the unit's guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be stored until the child is 25 years old. Continuous outcomes will be compared&#xD;
      between premature and term infants and between term infants and infants with CDH/AWD.&#xD;
      Student's t test will be used when the data are normally distributed and Mann-Whitney U test&#xD;
      when skewed. Categorical data will be assessed using the Fisher two tailed exact test. P&lt;0.05&#xD;
      will be considered significant. The ability of respiratory variables to accurately&#xD;
      discriminate between successful and failed extubation will be assessed using receiver&#xD;
      operating characteristic curves. A value of the area under the curve of 0.5 will indicate no&#xD;
      discriminatory value, and a value &gt;0.8 will suggest a high predictive value. Standard&#xD;
      formulae will be used to calculate sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative&#xD;
      predictive values and likelihood ratios. Statistical analyses will be performed using SPSS&#xD;
      software (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators anticipate that by incorporating information on respiratory muscle function&#xD;
      during the SBT, it will be possible to create an algorithm that will accurately predict&#xD;
      extubation outcome in mechanically ventilated infants. The investigators also want to&#xD;
      demonstrate that the rate of respiratory muscle relaxation might be different in premature&#xD;
      infants, in full-term infants and in infants with surgically corrected anomalies such as CDH&#xD;
      and AWD. These results will be incorporated in local clinical practice and form a guideline&#xD;
      on &quot;when to safely extubate&quot; infants on mechanical ventilation. This will reduce respiratory&#xD;
      morbidity associated both with prolonged ventilation as well as with failed extubation and&#xD;
      re-intubation.&#xD;
