      Gut microbiota is the largest microorganisms pool in the human body. The physiological roles&#xD;
      of gut microbiota for digestion, metabolism, immune homeostasis, GI-tract infection&#xD;
      prevention and anti-inflammation. The very first colonized gut microbiota of infant are from&#xD;
      maternal vaginal fluid. Gut microbiota are strongly affected by the environment, diet and&#xD;
      health status of host.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The alteration of gut microbiota (any microbial imbalance resulting in a shift (i.e., loss or&#xD;
      overgrowth of a species) and/or reduction in microbial diversity), which is known as&#xD;
      dysbiotic microbiota, is associated with numerous human diseases, including metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome, diabetes, obesity, depression and autism. Among people with hypercholesterolemia,&#xD;
      they tend to have lower richness and diversity of bacterial communities. In addition,&#xD;
      patients with type 2 diabetes were characterized by a moderate degree of gut microbial&#xD;
      dysbiosis, a decrease in the abundance of some universal butyrate-producing bacteria and an&#xD;
      increase in various opportunistic pathogens, as well as an enrichment of other microbial&#xD;
      functions conferring sulphate reduction and oxidative stress resistance. Gut microbiota are&#xD;
      also the primary source of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). These molecules are known to&#xD;
      significantly impact the gut environment and host metabolism and to exhibit potent&#xD;
      anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbial dysbiosis also impacts on local and systemic inflammation, which are relevant to&#xD;
      several human diseases. The gut is the main site for the generation of the two most important&#xD;
      T cell populations, the inducible regulatory T cells (iTregs) and CD4IL17-producing cells&#xD;
      (Th17). In physiological status, those T cells are responsible for immune tolerance, which&#xD;
      avoid inducing immune reaction toward the antigens presented in the gut microbiota9. However,&#xD;
      once the detrimental species of gut microbiota trigger the slow and persisted inflammatory&#xD;
      process in the gut, intestinal lymphocytes release pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL-1β, IL-6 and&#xD;
      TNF), which leads to the elevated intestinal permeability of mucosa. Inflammation induces the&#xD;
      permeabilization of gut mucosa and subsequent intestinal leak (leaky gut syndrome). The&#xD;
      leaking results in the entrance of large amount of bacterial toxins (such as LPS) into&#xD;
      systemic circulation and elevated systemic inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gut microbiota also play an important role in several neurological diseases due to the&#xD;
      presence of gut-brain axis. Distinct gut microbiota are found in plenty of people with&#xD;
      neurological diseases, such as autism, depression, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease (PD). Regarding to PD, a neurodegenerative disease with the most well-studied&#xD;
      gut-brain axis, 70% people with PD (PwP) suffered from gastrointestinal symptoms and&#xD;
      constipation is the most complained. Those symptoms stem from the degeneration of vagus&#xD;
      nerve-innervated mesenteric plexus. According to the well-known Braak stage which showed the&#xD;
      caudal rostral spreading of Lewy body, medullary vagal nucleus is the first area with the&#xD;
      involvement of PD-pathology. In fact, abnormal mesenteric α-synuclein accumulation herald the&#xD;
      vagal pathological change. The hypothesis that α-synuclein is originated from intestine is&#xD;
      supported by an animal study. Mice with mutated α-synuclein over-expressing had abundant&#xD;
      PD-pathology in the midbrain. However, elimination of gut microbiota attenuated the&#xD;
      pathology. This study hint that gut microbiota is essential for the aggregation of&#xD;
      α-synuclein and the therapeutic potential of modulation gut microbiota for the&#xD;
      neuroprotection of PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Distinct gut microbiota in PwPs compared with healthy people were demonstrated by several&#xD;
      studies: higher level of Akkermansia muciniphila, Bifidobacterium, Methanobrevibacter smithii&#xD;
      and Enterobacteriaceae whereas lower level of Prevotellacea, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and&#xD;
      Lactobacilli/Enterococci. Although the causal relationship between PD with the alteration of&#xD;
      specific species of bacteria is unknown, some of the bacterial species play role in the&#xD;
      aforementioned PD pathogenesis. For instance, Prevotella helps in breaking down complex&#xD;
      carbohydrates to produce anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory SCFAs and neuro-beneficial&#xD;
      thiamine and folate and reduce the amount of Prevotella may be harmful for the dopaminergic&#xD;
      neurons and augmentation the disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modulation of gut microbiota could be achieved by several approaches, such as fecal&#xD;
      microbiota transplantation, probiotics and antibiotics. Fecal transplantation obtained&#xD;
      certain success in patients with Clostridium difficile infection. In the field of&#xD;
      neurological diseases, clinical trials of fecal microbiota transplantation had been launched&#xD;
      for children with autism18. However, at the present stage, there is no &quot;standardized&quot; gut&#xD;
      microbiota about non-PD people, which limit the application of fecal microbiota&#xD;
      transplantation to PwP. Probiotics are easily-available over-the counter supplement which is&#xD;
      rich in beneficial micro-organisms. The advantages of probiotics include well-tolerated and&#xD;
      minimal adverse effects. Besides, increasing beneficial micro-organisms by intaking&#xD;
      probiotics is physiological. However, shared the same disadvantages with fecal microbiota&#xD;
      transplantation, there is no specific strain known to be beneficial for PD. Furthermore,&#xD;
      comparing with the amount of existing gut microbiota, the probiotics contain far fewer number&#xD;
      of micro-organisms. Once the cessation of application, those good micro-organisms are not&#xD;
      able to permanently grow in the gut and sometimes even trigger further dysbiosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antibiotics are well-known to modulate the gut microbiota. In fact, the very first time that&#xD;
      people are aware of the effect of antibiotics on gut microbiota is the antibiotics-related&#xD;
      pseudomembranous colitis, which is secondary to outgrowth of C.difficle due to the loss of&#xD;
      normal gut microbiota after the application of potent wide-spectrum antibiotics. Merely all&#xD;
      the antibiotics affect gut microbiota more or less, however, the net impact is usually&#xD;
      negative. It results in decrease number of beneficial microbiota, increase the harmful&#xD;
      strains and reduction the diversity. Unlike the transient effect of probiotics, antibiotics&#xD;
      lead to sustained or even permanent alterations. In the clinical observations, the&#xD;
      prescription of antibiotics in the childhood is associated with the risk of obesity in the&#xD;
      adulthood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fortunately, among hundreds of available antibiotics, rifaximin, a non-aminoglycoside&#xD;
      semi-synthetic, non-systemic antibiotic derived from rifamycin SV, is known to its unique&#xD;
      &quot;eubiotic&quot; effect. Rifaximin is approved by US-FDA in the treatment of traveler's diarrhea&#xD;
      and hepatic encephalopathy. According to the literatures, rifaximin did not result in the&#xD;
      decrease number of beneficial gut microbiota, such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. On&#xD;
      the other hand, rifaximin did not reduce the diversity of gut microbiota. Most importantly,&#xD;
      the effect is long-lasting. The direct effects of rifaximin on pathogens is through reducing&#xD;
      the expression of bacterial virulence factors. At the same time, some indirect effects, such&#xD;
      as rendering intestinal cells resistant to bacterial colonization, attachment and&#xD;
      internalization, and reducing mucosal inflammation work on host.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instead of the treatment of traveler's diarrhea and hepatic encephalopathy, rifaximin has&#xD;
      been applied to PD in clinical trials. PwPs tend to suffer from small intestine bacteria&#xD;
      overgrow (SIBO), which affects the absorption of polypeptide, especially levodopa and&#xD;
      contributes to the levodopa-induced motor fluctuation. In this trial, prescription of&#xD;
      rifaximin, 550mg twice a day for 7 days, significantly reduced the number of undesirable&#xD;
      bacteria in the gut, especially H.pylori and improved the response of levodopa. Importantly,&#xD;
      the adverse effects are minimal and tolerable1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, there is no available approaches to persistently modulate the gut microbiota of&#xD;
      PwPs. Moreover, it is unknown that whether modulate the gut microbiota is beneficial in the&#xD;
      clinical and serological biomarkers of PwPs. The present project aims to address these two&#xD;
      questions: 1. Whether 1-week rifaximin treatment is able to restore the gut microbiota in a&#xD;
      long-term manner in PwPs? 2. Whether the restoration of gut microbiota in PwPs is associated&#xD;
      with reduction of systemic inflammation and circulating exosomal α-synuclein?&#xD;
