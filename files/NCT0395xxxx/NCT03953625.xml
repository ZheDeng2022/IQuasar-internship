  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain is defined as pain or functional discomfort between the twelfth rib and the&#xD;
      gluteal fold, which may be median or lateralised. It can radiate up to the thigh but never&#xD;
      below the knee. Low back pain is said to be acute if it has been progressing for less than&#xD;
      three months. In the acute form, it evolves on a mechanical rhythm, prevents the usual&#xD;
      activity and occurs preferably in adults aged 20 to 55 years. 90% of these low back pains are&#xD;
      mechanical and common, i.e. characterized by the absence of &quot;red flags &quot;. The red flags refer&#xD;
      to a group of characteristic clinical signs that should alert the practitioner to the&#xD;
      possibility of an underlying serious spinal pathology and the need for further investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Common low back pain is a public health issue since it is the leading cause of health&#xD;
      expenditure in Europe and an economic challenge (900 million euros / year and 19.1% of work&#xD;
      stoppages in 2015 compared to 13% in 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 80% of cases, the general practitioner is in the first line of care in cases of acute low&#xD;
      back pain. Indeed, it represents a frequent reason for consultation in general medicine (2nd&#xD;
      reason for consultation among general practitioners in 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The doctor must: track down warning signs that call into question the diagnosis of common low&#xD;
      back pain (red flags), relieve and reassure the patient. Common low back pain very often&#xD;
      heals spontaneously but about 10% of patients will develop chronic low back pain (persistence&#xD;
      of pain for more than 3 months). These chronicized patients account for 80% of the total cost&#xD;
      of low back pain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According Paracetamol is often insufficient and it is necessary to switch to level 2&#xD;
      analgesics (tramadol, codeine). NSAIDs are used in short courses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is crucial to reassure the patient about the benign nature of the condition and to insist&#xD;
      on maintaining activities. Bed rest should never be recommended, let alone prescribed. The&#xD;
      usual activities of daily living should be maintained as much as possible within the limits&#xD;
      allowed by pain. A work stoppage may be considered if the professional constraints are&#xD;
      greater than those of daily life. The return to work has no deleterious effect and must be as&#xD;
      early as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is useful to detect early chronicization factors, especially psychosocial ones. Finally,&#xD;
      in order to prevent lumbar disability, patient education, based on the bio-psycho-social&#xD;
      model, must be an important part of patient care. The content of the physician's speech&#xD;
      strongly influences the patient's beliefs and behaviour. However, if the information can be&#xD;
      provided by the therapist, it can also be provided via brochures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is why the Health Insurance launched a public information campaign in November 2017 to&#xD;
      improve the management of low back therapeutic education, pain, spine sections], the French&#xD;
      Society of Rheumatologyk pain. The French Society of Rheumatology, The French Society of&#xD;
      Rheumatology, therapeutic education, pain, spine sections], the French Society of&#xD;
      Rheumatology physical and rehabilitation medicine and the college of general medicine have&#xD;
      worked together to publish a &quot;booklet back&quot;: I suffer from low back pain: what is it and what&#xD;
      to do? whose main objective is to fight against false beliefs concerning inter alia &quot;the&#xD;
      benefits of strict rest&quot;, to promote physical activity, and to recall the true indications of&#xD;
      complementary examinations (radiography, CT, or MRI of the spine) Thus, the back booklet&#xD;
      intended for the patient is distributed to general practitioners via the visits of the&#xD;
      delegates of the Health Insurance. Nearly 1,600,000 brochures were printed and made available&#xD;
      to delegates for distribution to health professionals, with 30 brochures per general&#xD;
      practitioner. The brochure is also available for download on ameli.fr in the &quot;insured&quot; and&#xD;
      &quot;health professionals&quot; sections (doctors, physiotherapists, care institutions, health&#xD;
      centres). In this study, one of the 2 participating centres is the Groupe Hospitalier Paris&#xD;
      Saint Joseph (GHPSJ), emergency department. Also, we contacted the health insurance to&#xD;
      receive brochures. To our knowledge, there is no other emergency service that has done this.&#xD;
      The 2nd service centre participating in the study is the general practitioner consultation&#xD;
      centre at the Marie-Thérèse health centre (CMT).&#xD;
