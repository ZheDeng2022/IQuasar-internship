  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rate of relapse following an inpatient alcohol rehabilitation program has been around 50%&#xD;
      for a number of years. Offered treatments mainly focus on conscious and controllable aspects&#xD;
      of behaviour, but research has found that much of the craving in addiction is guided by&#xD;
      automatic processes, which are for a large part unconscious and poorly controlled by the&#xD;
      individual. One way to influence these automatic processes is by applying cognitive bias&#xD;
      modification, a cognitive-behavioural intervention that can be applied by a computer&#xD;
      application. In alcohol addition, a common cognitive bias is the Alcohol-Approach bias. The&#xD;
      Anti-Alcohol Training is a form of cognitive bias modification that was developed to reduce&#xD;
      this approach bias and it has been shown to reduce the rates of relapse by 4-8%. A drawback&#xD;
      of the training is that patients do not continue this at home after discharge. One way to&#xD;
      increase accessibility is to offer the training in an app-game form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators have developed a smartphone based training app that allows&#xD;
      patients to more easily use the Anti-Alcohol training at home after discharge. The study aims&#xD;
      to assess whether use of the app further reduces the alcohol bias and whether it can reduce&#xD;
      yearly relapse rates.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The rate of relapse following an inpatient alcohol rehabilitation program has been around 50%&#xD;
      for a number of years, in spite of many initiatives to try and reduce relapse. One of the&#xD;
      reasons could be that the offered treatments mainly focus on conscious and controllable&#xD;
      aspects of behaviour. Recent research has however found that much of the craving in addiction&#xD;
      is guided by automatic processes, which are for a large part unconscious and poorly&#xD;
      controlled by the individual. Unsurprisingly, many attempts have therefore been made in&#xD;
      addition research to reduce these automatic impulsive behaviour and improve the control&#xD;
      processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One way to influence these automatic processes is by applying cognitive bias modification, a&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioural intervention that can be applied by a computer application. In alcohol&#xD;
      addition, a common cognitive bias is the Alcohol-Approach bias, the tendency to automatically&#xD;
      approach alcohol. The Anti-Alcohol Training is a form of cognitive bias modification that was&#xD;
      developed to reduce this approach bias. Studies have shows that this training can reduce the&#xD;
      rates of relapse by 4-8%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A drawback of the training is that patients often do not continue this at home after&#xD;
      discharge, probably due to low motivation. One way to resolve this issue could be to offer&#xD;
      the training in an App-game form, which would make it more accessible and inviting to&#xD;
      continue using it after return home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators have developed a smartphone based training app that allows&#xD;
      patients to more easily use the Anti-Alcohol training at home after discharge. The study aims&#xD;
      to assess whether alcohol dependent patients continue to use this app at home, whether the&#xD;
      use of the app further reduces the alcohol bias, and finally whether it can reduce yearly&#xD;
      relapse rates.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Participants will be notified there are 2 versions of the app and they will randomly be assigned to one of the 2 conditions, but will not know which one. Therapists giving the users input on how to use the app do not know in which condition the patient is either. Outcome (relapse rates) are assessed by interns and admin staff of the clinic who are independent from the study. The study investigators do not know the patients and only receive anonymized data on group and outcome variables.</masking_description>
