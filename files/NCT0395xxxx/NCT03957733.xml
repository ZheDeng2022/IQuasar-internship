  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II/III randomized study involving non-metastatic rectal cancer patients who&#xD;
      are candidates for neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Eligible patients will be randomized&#xD;
      between two treatment arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental arm: Long course CRT is followed by 4 cycles of combination chemotherapy of&#xD;
      modified FOLFOX6 or 3 cycles of XELOX and then surgery. After surgery, patients with pT0-2 N0&#xD;
      will not receive adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients with higher pathological stage will receive&#xD;
      adjuvant chemotherapy (4 cycles of modified FOLFOX6 or 3 cycles of XELOX).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard arm: Long course CRT will be followed by surgery 10-12 weeks after the end of CRT.&#xD;
      After surgery, patients with pT0-2 N0 will not receive adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients with&#xD;
      higher pathological stage will receive adjuvant chemotherapy (8 cycles of modified FOLFOX6 or&#xD;
      6 cycles of XELOX).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to assess the efficacy of consolidation chemotherapy given in the interval&#xD;
      between the end of CRT and surgery to allow for early initiation of systemic therapy aiming&#xD;
      to decrease distant relapse rate and enhancing pathological response.&#xD;
