      The objective of this study is to assess equivalency of the transabdominal Clarius handheld&#xD;
      wifi C3 ultrasound (which uses Bluetooth to locate the ipad Mini 5 and then uses wifi direct&#xD;
      to show the images) to the current standard of care in Women's Hospital outpatient department&#xD;
      the portable Zonare ZS3 in patients presenting in the first trimester of pregnancy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study in which first trimester participants who are presenting to&#xD;
      discuss termination of pregnancy, will consent to have an additional transabdominal&#xD;
      ultrasound with the Clarius C3 immediately prior to their standard ultrasound which is&#xD;
      performed to date their pregnancy. Participants who are presenting for medical abortion have&#xD;
      been prescreened to be estimated to be less than 9 weeks GA. Participants who are being seen&#xD;
      prior to surgical abortion will have been screened by nurses based on their last menstrual&#xD;
      period or estimated time of conception to estimate their gestational age. Potential&#xD;
      participants estimated to be less than 13 weeks GA, will be approached to see if they are&#xD;
      interested in participating in the study before they are seen by their health care provider.&#xD;
      The name, date of approach, and reason for decline of potential participants who refuse to&#xD;
      participate will be documented. If agreeable, the participant will complete consent with a&#xD;
      study nurse or medical student for the additional ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will then receive the 2 ultrasounds by the same health care provider with the&#xD;
      Clarius C3 ultrasound first, then the standard care ultrasound. Occasionally, there may be a&#xD;
      different provider doing the Clarius C3 ultrasound when the patient consents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive standard care for medical or surgical abortion. The following&#xD;
      information will be documented from their chart:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Height and weight, age, Obstetrical history (Gravida, para, number cesareans, ectopic&#xD;
      pregnancies, spontaneous abortions, therapeutic abortions). If they do not have a documented&#xD;
      intrauterine pregnancy, the standard questions to rule out possibility of ectopic pregnancy&#xD;
      will be determined, and any positive answers will be documented in the chart. Anyone without&#xD;
      a documented intrauterine pregnancy (no gestational sac or a gestational sac with no definite&#xD;
      crown rump length or yolk sac) will be followed until a final outcome is determined or they&#xD;
      are lost to follow up. When the patient has a pregnancy of unknown location (no evidence of a&#xD;
      pregnancy inside or outside of the uterus), their data will not be used to compare the two&#xD;
      ultrasounds but future outcome will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final outcome of their pregnancy and any complications will be determined within the next&#xD;
      6 weeks with the following potential outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      completed medical abortion, completed surgical abortion (possibily following failed medical&#xD;
      abortion), lost to follow up, continuing pregnancy, or ectopic pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a participant is determined to be over 13 weeks GA, they will receive a dating ultrasound&#xD;
      with the Clarius C3 ultrasound using biparietal diameter as appropriate but it will not be&#xD;
      included in the final study measurements.&#xD;
