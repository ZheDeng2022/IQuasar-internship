  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment resistant depression remains a major problem for individuals and society. Surgical&#xD;
      procedures may provide relief for some of these patients. The most frequently considered&#xD;
      surgical approach is deep brain stimulation (DBS) of a part of the brain called the&#xD;
      subcallosal cingulate region. However, the effectiveness and safety is not well established.&#xD;
      The investigators will use a novel approach using advanced imaging technique (magnetic&#xD;
      resonance tractography) to evaluate the feasibility and safety of this surgical approach. An&#xD;
      innovative method for the definition of DBS target will be applied that redefines the concept&#xD;
      of targeting as one of targeting a symptomatic network rather than a structural brain region&#xD;
      using subject-based brain anatomy to define the target location. The correlation between&#xD;
      imaging findings at baseline with the mood score changes at different time points of the&#xD;
      study will be investigated.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>There will be an initial 12-month open label period for all participants involved. In the second period of the study, patients will be divided into groups: responders (defined as a 40% reduction or more in MADRS) versus non-responders. Responders will continue to the 6-month double-blinded discontinuation phase (see below for additional details of study procedures during this phase). The non-responders, after the open label period (12 months) will have monthly follow-up visits for 12 mo. During the discontinuation period, patients will be randomized to either the ON or OFF stimulation phase for 3 mo each. If randomized to ON, there will be no change for 3 mo, then a biweekly 25% reduction in stimulation amplitude for the next 3 mo until stimulation is off. If randomization to OFF phase, there will be an initial biweekly 25% reduction in stimulation amplitude for 3 mo until the device is off then the stimulation settings will be turned back to the optimized settings for three months.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Change in another related clinical assessment: PHQ-9</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in PHQ-9: Patient Health Questionnaire 9. The PHQ-9 the 9-item depression module from the full PHQ. Major depression is diagnosed if 5 or more of the 9 depressive symptom criteria have been present at least &quot;more than half the days&quot; in the past 2 weeks, and 1 of the symptoms is depressed mood or anhedonia. Other depression is diagnosed if 2, 3, or 4 depressive symptoms have been present at least &quot;more than half the days&quot; in the past 2 weeks, and 1 of the symptoms is depressed mood or anhedonia. One of the 9 symptom criteria (&quot;thoughts that you would be better off dead or of hurting yourself in some way&quot;) counts if present at all, regardless of duration. The clinician is expected to rule out physical causes of depression, normal bereavement, and history of a manic episode. As a severity measure, the PHQ-9 score can range from 0 to 27, since each of the 9 items can be scored from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day).</description>

    <measure>Change in another related clinical assessment: HAMD-17</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in HAMD-17:Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. The HAMD-17 is a 17-item scale that evaluates depressed mood, vegetative and cognitive symptoms of depression, and comorbid anxiety symptoms. The HAMD-17 was one of the first rating scales developed to quantify the severity of depressive symptomatology. First introduced by Max Hamilton in 1960, it has since become the most widely used and accepted outcome measure for evaluating depression severity. It provides ratings on current DSM-IV symptoms of depression, with the exceptions of hypersomnia, increased appetite, and concentration/indecision. The HAMD-17 was designed to be administered by a trained clinician using a semi-structured clinical interview. The 17- items are rated on either a 5-point (0-4) or a 3-point (0-2) scale.</description>

    <measure>Change in another related clinical assessment: SCID-II</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in SCID-II: Structural Clinical Interview for Personality Disorders.This is a semi-structured interview for making DSM-IV Axis II (Personality Disorder) diagnoses and is designed to be administered by a clinician or trained mental health professional. A SCID II takes 1/2 to 1 hour to administer. There are 3 components to the SCID-II. The interview itself covers the 11 DSM-IV Personality Disorders. After the subject fills out the Personality Questionnaire (which usually takes 20 minutes), the clinician simply circles the numbers to the left of the SCID-II items that correspond to items answered &quot;yes&quot; on the questionnaire. The clinician needs only to inquire about the items screened positive on the questionnaire. The assumption is that a subject who responds with a &quot;no&quot; on the questionnaire item would also have answered &quot;no&quot; to the same question had it been read aloud by the interviewer. For this study, only the subsection for Cluster B will be administered.</description>

    <measure>Change in another related clinical assessment: SF-36</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in SF-36: Short Form 36. The SF-36 Health Survey is a 36-item, patient-reported survey of patient health. The SF-36 is a measure of health status and is commonly used in health economics as a variable in the quality-adjusted life year calculation to determine the cost-effectiveness of a health treatment. The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>

    <measure>Change in another related clinical assessment: HLQ</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in HLQ: Health and Labor Questionnaire. The HLQ is designed to collect quantitative data on the relation between illness and treatment and work performance. The HLQ data permits the estimation of production losses (costs) of paid and unpaid labor. It contains also an indicator for impediments for paid and unpaid labor, one of the indicators for quality of life. The HLQ is divided into 4 modules to collect data about absence from work, reduced productivity at paid work, unpaid labor production and impediments to paid and unpaid labor. The modular structure permits the omission of questions that are not applicable to the study population. The questionnaire is suitable for self-assessment.</description>

    <measure>Change in another related clinical assessment: YMRS</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in YMRS: Young Mania Rating Scale. The Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) is a rating scale to assess manic symptoms. The scale has 11 items and is based on the patient's subjective report of their clinical condition over the previous 48 hours. The items are selected based upon published descriptions of the core symptoms of mania. Each item given a severity rating. There are four items that are graded on a 0 to 8 scale (irritability, speech, thought content, and disruptive/aggressive behavior), while the remaining seven items are graded on a 0 to 4 scale. The authors encourage the use of whole or half point ratings once experience with the scale is acquired. Typical baseline scores can vary a lot and depend on the patients' clinical features such as mania (YMRS = 12), depression (YMRS = 3), or euthymia (YMRS = 2). Sometimes a clinical study entry requirement of YMRS &gt; 20 generates a mean YMRS baseline of about 30.</description>

    <measure>Change in another related clinical assessment: PSQI</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in PSQI: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. The PSQI is a 19-item questionnaire evaluating sleep quality and disturbances over the past month.The first 4 items are open questions, whereas items 5 to 19 are rated on a 4-point Likert scale. Individual items scores yield 7 components. A total score, ranging from 0 to 21, is obtained by adding the 7 component scores. A score &gt; 5 suggests poor sleep quality. The psychometric properties of the PSQI have been documented in multiple studies, including one with a French-Canadian sample. The PSQI was used because it measures a construct (sleep quality) that is related to insomnia but a construct that is broader than insomnia severity. It was administered to the community sample only.</description>

    <measure>Change in another related clinical assessment: ISI</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in ISI: Insomnia Severity Index. The ISI is a 7-item self-report questionnaire assessing the nature, severity, and impact of insomnia. The usual recall period is the &quot;last month&quot; and the dimensions evaluated are: severity of sleep onset, sleep maintenance, and early morning awakening problems, sleep dissatisfaction, interference of sleep difficulties with daytime functioning, noticeability of sleep problems by others, and distress caused by the sleep difficulties. A 5-point Likert scale is used to rate each item (e.g., 0 = no problem; 4 = very severe problem), yielding a total score ranging from 0 to 28. The total score is interpreted as follows: absence of insomnia (0-7); sub-threshold insomnia (8-14); moderate insomnia (15-21); and severe insomnia (22-28). Three versions are available-patient, clinician, and significant others-but the present paper focuses on the patient version only.</description>

    <description>Change in TEPS: Temporal Experience of Pleasure Scale. The TEPS has 18 items and two subscales designed to distinguish between anticipatory and consummatory pleasure. It uses a 6-point Likert scale (from 1 = very false for me to 6 = very true for me). Items only reflect physical anhedonia. A significant advantage of this scale is that its two-factor structure that separates anticipatory and consummatory aspects of reward.</description>
