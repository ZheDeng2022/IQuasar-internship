  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical study is to investigate the safety, tolerability, and&#xD;
      feasibility of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and ventral&#xD;
      internal capsule (VC) for participants with treatment refractory opioid use disorder (OUD)&#xD;
      who have cognitive, behavioral, and functional disability. This study will also provide&#xD;
      critical information for planning subsequent clinical trials.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, feasibility and&#xD;
      impact on outcomes of NAc/VC DBS for treatment refractory OUD. In treatment refractory OUD,&#xD;
      innovative approaches and more invasive interventions including DBS are warranted to improve&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
