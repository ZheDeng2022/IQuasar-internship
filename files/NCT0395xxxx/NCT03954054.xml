  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol is the most harmful psychoactive substance in terms of overall damage. Although&#xD;
      abstinence remains the objective of most pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches&#xD;
      addressing alcohol use disorder (AUD), new therapeutic objectives of reduced alcohol intake&#xD;
      and controlled-drinking have emerged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHER (&quot;Education THEérapeutique pour la Réduction des dommages en alcoologie&quot; or therapeutic&#xD;
      education for the reduction of alcohol-related harms) is an ongoing, multicentre,&#xD;
      community-based mixed-methods study, which aims to evaluate the innovative therapeutic&#xD;
      patient education (TPE) programme named &quot;Choizitaconso&quot;. This programme teaches psychosocial&#xD;
      skills to people with alcohol use disorder (PWAUD), to help them (re)establish controlled&#xD;
      drinking and reduce harms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation of the programme will rely on a sequential explanatory design, where the&#xD;
      qualitative study (16 semi-structured interviews) will assist in explaining and interpreting&#xD;
      the findings of the controlled before-and-after quantitative study.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ETHER's quantitative component is a 6-month controlled study which evaluates the&#xD;
      effectiveness of &quot;Choizitaconso&quot; by comparing 30 PWAUD following the programme with a control&#xD;
      group of 60 PWAUD not following it. All 90 PWAUD are individually interviewed using&#xD;
      standardized face-to-face and phone-based interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      34 questions on alcohol-related harms were identified in the international literature and&#xD;
      approved by the PWAUD community. The sum of these harms, considered as a measure of the&#xD;
      individual &quot;burden&quot; related to alcohol use, will be used as principal outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes are quantity and frequency of alcohol consumption, craving for alcohol,&#xD;
      coping strategies, Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQL), self-confidence to resist drinking,&#xD;
      anticipated and internalized stigma, treatment self-regulation, anxiety and depressive&#xD;
      symptoms, alcohol-related neuropsychological impairments and capabilities (i.e., a measure of&#xD;
      wellbeing for the general adult population, used in economic evaluations).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary and secondary outcomes will be collected in face-to-face and phone-based interviews&#xD;
      at enrolment and 6 months after enrolment. We will use a binomial test and linear regression&#xD;
      models to assess the impact of the TPE programme on changes in the principal and secondary&#xD;
      outcomes, while adjusting for other correlates and confounders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study's qualitative component comprises semi-structured interviews of 16 PWAUD who&#xD;
      completed the TPE programme at least 6 months before the interview. Qualitative interviews&#xD;
      will be analysed using thematic analysis.&#xD;

34 questions on alcohol-related harms (physical, social and behavioural consequences) were identified by and with the community of PWAUD during several working sessions.&#xD;
Alcohol-related harms assessment is scheduled at enrolment (i.e., before the TPE programme initiation for the intervention group) and 6 months later.</description>

    <description>Choizitaconso is a therapeutic patient education programme that teaches psychosocial skills to people with alcohol use disorder (PWAUD), to help them (re)establish controlled drinking and reduce harms.&#xD;
It lasts for 10 weeks for each participant and consists of the following 5 modules, including one optional module focusing on the family environment:&#xD;
Understand the mechanisms that trigger and/or maintain alcohol-related difficulties&#xD;
Plan and evaluate personalized controlled drinking strategies&#xD;
Understand and identify external and internal influences (e.g., thoughts and emotions), identify and manage risk situations&#xD;
Identify alcohol effects and alcohol-related expectations (by developing self-observation skills)&#xD;
Family environment: learning how to evaluate and take care of oneself (e.g., how to express feelings)&#xD;
Each module consists of 2 to 4 collective workshops that each last 120 minutes and involve 5 to 10 persons.</description>
