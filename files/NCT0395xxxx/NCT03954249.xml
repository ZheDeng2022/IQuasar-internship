      Study the benefits of a Erector Spinae nerve block for pain control and decrease narcotics&#xD;
      usage after mammoplasty in an ambulatory setting&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast surgery is among the most common procedures performed at ambulatory surgery centers.&#xD;
      Whether for cosmetic or cancer indications, mastectomy and reduction mammoplasty are being&#xD;
      performed under general anesthesia with standard multimodal pharmacologic analgesia. Regional&#xD;
      anesthetic techniques have become increasingly prevalent in the management of postoperative&#xD;
      analgesia. In oncologic surgery, regional anesthetic techniques have demonstrated a lower&#xD;
      incidence of recurrence or metastasis of breast cancer compared to opioid analgesia. The&#xD;
      breast has complex innervation, receiving innervation from C5-T7, thus posing a challenge to&#xD;
      the regional anesthesiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current regional techniques for breast and other thoracic surgeries, such as open heart&#xD;
      surgery, include the PEC I, PEC II, serratus anterior block as well as the paravertebral&#xD;
      block. Of these options, the paravertebral block is heralded as the gold standard for&#xD;
      multimodal analgesia in breast surgery. Unfortunately, the paravertebral block carries with&#xD;
      it the risk of pneumothorax due to its proximity to the pleura. This risk is also increased&#xD;
      when an inexperienced provider is performing the block, which is common on an academic&#xD;
      institution. As a result, the PEC I, PEC II and serratus anterior blocks have gained&#xD;
      traction, is that they carry less risk of adverse events. One drawback of the PEC blocks and&#xD;
      serratus anterior block is that they may not achieve adequate anterior spread and complete&#xD;
      coverage of the surgical field, making them less effective at providing adequate&#xD;
      post-operative analgesia. Due to these drawbacks, the erector spinae plane block (ESPB) has&#xD;
      begun to gain traction as the regional technique of choice for breast surgery. The ESPB is a&#xD;
      myofascial block alternative to the paravertebral block. [1] It is performed by injecting&#xD;
      local anesthetic in the plane between the erector spinae muscle and the spinal transverse&#xD;
      process. The ESPB is thought to be safer than the paravertebral block because the transverse&#xD;
      process acts as a barrier to the pleura. It has been postulated that local anesthetic spread&#xD;
      reaches the paravertebral space and in fact, cadaveric studies have shown dye spreading to&#xD;
      involve the ventral and dorsal rami of spinal nerves. It is because of this mechanism of&#xD;
      action that this block has been call the &quot;paravertebral by proxy.&quot; The spread of the local&#xD;
      anesthetic is volume-dependent, and has been seen to anesthetize between 3-8 vertebral levels&#xD;
      when using local anesthetic volumes of 15-20mL. The ESPB has been used successfully for&#xD;
      analgesia in open-heart surgery as well as in chronic thoracic neuropathy secondary to&#xD;
      herpetic neuralgia. Proponents of the erector spinae block prefer it to the paravertebral&#xD;
      block for its ease to perform and seemingly safer profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators seek to explore the proposed benefits of the erector spinae plane block in&#xD;
      our patients undergoing bilateral breast reduction mammoplasty. Reducing overall opioid use&#xD;
      and enhancing recovery after surgery are areas of great importance in the ambulatory,&#xD;
      outpatient setting. The investigators hope to show the positive impact of ESPB on both of&#xD;
      important perioperative factors.&#xD;
