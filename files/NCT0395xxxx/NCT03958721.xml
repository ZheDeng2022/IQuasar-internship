  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, prospective, non-randomized, feasibility study evaluating concurrent&#xD;
      capecitabine-radiotherapy in participants with Resistant Breast Cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To evaluate the feasibility of a novel concurrent capecitabine-radiotherapy regimen by&#xD;
      characterizing the percentage of patients who complete concurrent capecitabine-radiotherapy&#xD;
      as a preliminary study before a larger trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To report the tolerability of concurrent capecitabine-radiotherapy with patient-reported&#xD;
           HRQOL outcomes via RAND 36-Item Health Survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize radiation dermatitis secondary to concurrent capecitabine-radiotherapy&#xD;
           through patient-reported RISR scores and to compare concurrent RISR scores to published&#xD;
           reports of patients undergoing breast cancer radiotherapy only.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To provide a preliminary description of the toxicity profile of concurrent capecitabine&#xD;
           radiotherapy and report the frequency of grade 3 or grade 4 toxicity during combined&#xD;
           therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To report the feasibility of completion of all study assessments, and completion of all&#xD;
           study and exploratory assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outline:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will investigate chemoradiotherapy with capecitabine at 1000 mg/m2 BID every other&#xD;
      week during radiotherapy.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with histologically confirmed non-metastatic invasive breast cancer who will&#xD;
             be undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy and have persistent disease at time of&#xD;
             definitive surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Tumors must have ER/PR/HER2 status reported by available pathology report(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Both triple negative and hormone receptor positive patients are eligible for&#xD;
                  enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  May not include capecitabine or 5-FU containing regimens&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Resolution of adverse events from neoadjuvant chemotherapy including&#xD;
                  biochemical/hematologic to CTCAE v5.0 grade 1 or below (except alopecia) prior to&#xD;
                  initiation of study therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Recovery time between surgery and study therapy â‰¥ 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Persistent invasive disease following neoadjuvant chemotherapy in either the breast,&#xD;
             lymph node, or both ). Any residual tumor; lack of complete pathologic response.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients planning to receive adjuvant radiation to the breast and/or regional nodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients planning to receive capecitabine per the treating physician&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients already receiving capecitabine as adjuvant therapy are eligible to enroll in this&#xD;
        study, provided adverse events deemed by the treating physician as possibly, probably or&#xD;
        definitely related to adjuvant capecitabine prior to study therapy have resolved to CTCAE&#xD;
        v.5.0 grade 1 or below (except alopecia), and provided duration of planned capecitabine&#xD;
        includes entire duration of planned radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status 0 or 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tamoxifen: patients who have received Tamoxifen as chemoprevention are still eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Endocrine receptor therapies (Hormone receptor inhibitors) may not be given with study&#xD;
        treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  . Patients who have had radiation to the contralateral breast are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating females. Women who are pregnant or who become pregnant are&#xD;
             excluded from this study because capecitabine is a chemotherapeutic agent with the&#xD;
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but&#xD;
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with capecitabine, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is&#xD;
             treated with capecitabine. These potential risks may also apply to radiotherapy used&#xD;
             in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serious medical or psychiatric illness that in the judgement of the treating physician&#xD;
             places the patient at risk &amp; would limit compliance with the study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to swallow or retain whole pills.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known or suspected allergy to capecitabine or 5-FU.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Contraindications to capecitabine or radiotherapy as determined by the treating&#xD;
             physician including severe renal impairment (GFR &lt; 30).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior radiation to the ipsilateral breast.&#xD;
