  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heated, humidified high-flow air (HHHFA) devices improve airway clearance. HHHFA use for an&#xD;
      average of 1.6 hours a day in COPD patients with chronic bronchitis improves health-related&#xD;
      quality of life, lung function, and delays the first respiratory exacerbation. However, HHHFA&#xD;
      for an average of 1.6 hours a day had no effect on COPD exacerbation frequency or&#xD;
      hospitalization, dyspnea, or exercise capacity, likely due to short duration of the&#xD;
      treatment. Conversely, the effect of HHHFA for longer time periods on chronic bronchitis&#xD;
      patients has not been studied. Moreover, the effect of HHHFA on sleep quality has not been&#xD;
      studied. A prior study in COPD patients showed that use of HHHFA for more than 7 hours during&#xD;
      sleep can be achieved. The overall objective of this research is to examine the effect of&#xD;
      HHHFA during sleep on COPD patients with chronic bronchitis. In this pilot study, the study&#xD;
      team will examine the effect of HHHFA during sleep on clinically relevant short-term outcomes&#xD;
      including: respiratory symptoms, quality of life and sleep, lung function and exercise&#xD;
      capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be recruited and consented. Once a subject agrees to be in the study the&#xD;
      baseline visit will occur. The first test will be the Pulmonary Function testing. If the&#xD;
      subject qualifies based on the PFT's they will complete the remainder of the baseline visit.&#xD;
      During this visit subjects will complete questionnaires, have a physical, 6 minute walk test&#xD;
      and CT scan. Subjects will receive device training on the heated, humidified high-flow air&#xD;
      device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will have a followup call between 3-7 days to check in on how the subject is doing&#xD;
      with the device. After 6 weeks the subject will return for another round of testing as was&#xD;
      done at baseline. This will be the final study visit.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by respiratory exacerbations&#xD;
      which increase in frequency as the severity of the disease progresses. COPD exacerbations may&#xD;
      lead to hospitalizations, which make up the largest proportion of the total direct&#xD;
      health-care cost of the disease and are a significant burden for patients and family. Chronic&#xD;
      bronchitis, defined as chronic cough with sputum production for at least 3 months a year for&#xD;
      2 consecutive years, is one of the clinical manifestations of COPD. Chronic bronchitis&#xD;
      doubles the risk of COPD exacerbations and hospitalizations, and is associated with increased&#xD;
      dyspnea, worse health-related quality of life, and poorer quality of sleep. Chronic&#xD;
      bronchitis also results in increased air trapping and hyperinflation, which decreases&#xD;
      exercise capacity. Unfortunately, other than traditional inhaled pharmacological agents,&#xD;
      there are no treatment options for COPD patients with chronic bronchitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heated, humidified high-flow air (HHHFA) devices improve airway clearance. HHHFA use for an&#xD;
      average of 1.6 hours a day in COPD patients with chronic bronchitis improves health-related&#xD;
      quality of life, lung function, and delays the first respiratory exacerbation. However, HHHFA&#xD;
      for an average of 1.6 hours a day had no effect on COPD exacerbation frequency or&#xD;
      hospitalization, dyspnea, or exercise capacity, likely due to short duration of the&#xD;
      treatment. Conversely, the effect of HHHFA for longer time periods on chronic bronchitis&#xD;
      patients has not been studied. Moreover, the effect of HHHFA on sleep quality has not been&#xD;
      studied. A prior study in COPD patients showed that use of HHHFA for more than 7 hours during&#xD;
      sleep can be achieved. The overall objective of this research is to examine the effect of&#xD;
      HHHFA during sleep on COPD patients with chronic bronchitis. In this pilot study, the study&#xD;
      team will examine the effect of HHHFA during sleep on clinically relevant short-term outcomes&#xD;
      including: respiratory symptoms, quality of life and sleep, lung function and exercise&#xD;
      capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: HHHFA during sleep in COPD patients with chronic bronchitis improves&#xD;
      respiratory symptoms, sleep quality, lung function, and exercise capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To examine the effect of HHHFA during sleep on respiratory symptoms, sleep quality,&#xD;
      lung function, and exercise capacity in COPD patients with chronic bronchitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of HHHFA on air trapping and hyperinflation has not been studied. Air trapping and&#xD;
      hyperinflation as well as other radiographic measurements associated with chronic bronchitis&#xD;
      (e.g. airway wall thickness) can be measured using chest CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: HHHFA during sleep in COPD patients with chronic bronchitis improves air&#xD;
      trapping and hyperinflation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To examine the effect of HHHFA in COPD patients with chronic bronchitis during sleep&#xD;
      on air trapping and hyperinflation through chest CT imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: The study team will include COPD subjects with a post-bronchodilator FEV1%predicted&#xD;
      below 70% and chronic bronchitis. The study team will include subjects with at least 2&#xD;
      exacerbations in the last year to identify patients with significant burden due to chronic&#xD;
      bronchitis. The study team will exclude subjects with recent respiratory events or procedures&#xD;
      as the study team want to capture the benefit of HHHFA on chronic, stable COPD participants.&#xD;
      Subjects who meet eligibility criteria will be randomized to HHHFA or usual care (Controls).&#xD;
      At baseline the study team will perform measurements in all subjects that include dyspnea,&#xD;
      cough, health-related quality of life, sleep quality, spirometry, a 6-minute walk test, and&#xD;
      chest CT. All subjects, from both groups will also use the SPIREHEALTH Tag Device to measure&#xD;
      their daily heart rate, respiratory rate, patient activity and calories. The group that is&#xD;
      randomized to use the HHHFA device will be provided the HHHFA device at the baseline visit.&#xD;
      Subjects will use the device during sleep for 6 weeks and both the HHHFA arm and the control&#xD;
      arm will return for a 6 week follow up visit. At the 6 week follow up visit, participants&#xD;
      will repeat all baseline evaluations. The study team will compare variables (e.g. FEV1)&#xD;
      between baseline and 6-week visit in each treatment group. The study team will also compare&#xD;
      changes in those variables over time between groups. To evaluate the effect of treatment&#xD;
      between baseline and 6 weeks, the study team will use linear mixed effect models controlling&#xD;
      for demographics and lung function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who have been using the HHHFA device will be asked to stop using the device for the&#xD;
      next 6 weeks. Both arms will then have a follow up phone call at the end of the 6 weeks (12&#xD;
      week follow up phone call visit). Subjects from both arms will continue to use the&#xD;
      SPIREHEALTH and that data will be collected for both arms during that 6 week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who were previously randomized to the HHHFA arm will be asked, at the 6 week follow&#xD;
      up visit, if they would be interested in participating in an optional sub-study that would&#xD;
      allow them to start using the HHHFA device again, after their 12 week follow up phone call&#xD;
      for an additional 36 weeks (for a total study involvement of 48 weeks) The subjects will have&#xD;
      follow up phone call visits at 24 weeks, 36 weeks, and 48 weeks. Subjects who were randomized&#xD;
      to the HHHFA device but do not want to keep using the device will be given the option of&#xD;
      continuing to participate but only will the follow up phone call visits. Respiratory&#xD;
      exacerbations information will be collected at these phone call visits.&#xD;
