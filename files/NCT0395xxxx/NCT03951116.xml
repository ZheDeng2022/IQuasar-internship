  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a drug called FCN-437c as a possible treatment for patients&#xD;
      with advanced unresectable/metastatic solid tumors.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational&#xD;
      intervention and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational&#xD;
      intervention to use for further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is&#xD;
      being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are evaluating a new drug, FCN-437c, as a potential&#xD;
      new treatment for cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved FCN-437c as a treatment for&#xD;
      any disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FCN-437c is a new generation CDK4/6 inhibitor. The CDK 4/6 inhibitors play a key role in&#xD;
      regulating the transition from G1 to the S-phase of the cell cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cyclin D-cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6-inhibitor of CDK4 (INK4)-retinoblastoma (Rb)&#xD;
      pathway controls cell cycle progression by regulating the G1-S checkpoint. Dysregulation of&#xD;
      the cyclin D-CDK4/6-INK4-Rb pathway results in increased proliferation, and is frequently&#xD;
      observed in many types of cancer. Due to the importance of CDK4/6 activity in cancer cells,&#xD;
      CDK4/6 inhibitors have emerged as promising candidates for cancer treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FCN-437c is a novel, potent and selective inhibitor of CDK4/6 exhibiting cellular potency&#xD;
      against a number of human tumor cell lines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory experiments show that FNC-437c may stop tumor growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purposes of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of FCN-437c when administered orally to subjects&#xD;
           with advanced solid tumors&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the MTD and/or the Phase 2 Dose for FCN-437c&#xD;
