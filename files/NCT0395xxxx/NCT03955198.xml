    <textblock>
      This study is a single-arm phase II, multicenter study designed to evaluate the activity of&#xD;
      stereotactic radiotherapy plus the continuation of durvalumab for 12 more months for patients&#xD;
      presenting with NSCLC metachronous oligometastatic disease during post-chemoradiotherapy&#xD;
      durvalumab consolidation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifty patients will have to be enrolled in this phase II trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total duration of treatment will be 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed for a maximum of 2 years following the date of inclusion.&#xD;
