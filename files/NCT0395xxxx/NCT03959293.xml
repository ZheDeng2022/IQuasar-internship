  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastric adenocarcinoma is the 4th most frequent cancer and the 2nd leading cause of cancer&#xD;
      mortality. Most of the patients have metastatic, locally advanced or recurrent unresectable&#xD;
      disease. So, systemic treatment remains an important issue especially since chemotherapy&#xD;
      improves survival and quality of life (compared to best supportive care alone).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second-line chemotherapy-based treatment improves overall survival (OS) as compared to best&#xD;
      supportive care alone in patients with an acceptable general condition (performance status&#xD;
      0-2). Indeed, with docetaxel monotherapy there was a significant difference in overall&#xD;
      survival for the chemotherapy arm with a median of 5.2 versus 3.6 months in best supportive&#xD;
      care alone arm (HR=0.67, p=0.01). Irinotecan monotherapy also significantly improves overall&#xD;
      survival compared to supportive care alone in a phase III study (4.0 versus 2.4 months;&#xD;
      HR=0.48, 95%CI 0.25-0.92; p=0.012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on a phase III trial FOLFIRI (5-FU plus irinotecan) is one most used regimen in&#xD;
      second-line in European countries, especially in France. FFCD 0307 trial, a phase III&#xD;
      comparing FOLFIRI-ECX (epirubicin-cisplatin-capecitabine) to the reverse sequence&#xD;
      (ECX-FOLFIRI), showed that both sequences are possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary results in metastatic gastric cancer with anti-PD1 mAbs are highly promising. In&#xD;
      a trial with pembrolizumab, only PD-L1 positive tumors were eligible to the treatment with a&#xD;
      cut off at 1%. Thirty-nine patients were enrolled and 67% had received at least two prior&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimens. The overall response rate was 22%. The median PFS and OS were 1.9&#xD;
      months and 11.4 months, respectively. KEYNOTE-059 Phase 2 multicohort study with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab monotherapy in advanced gastric cancer treatment has been presented at ASCO&#xD;
      2017 meeting. Among 259 patients included in the trial response rate was 11.6%. OS was 5.6&#xD;
      months. Response rates were 15.5% in PDL1+ tumors versus 6.4% in PDL1- tumors and 57.1% in&#xD;
      MSI tumors versus 9% in MSS tumors. Up until now, overlap between microsatellite instability&#xD;
      and PD-L1 expression is unknown in gastric cancer. An anti-PD-L1 mAb (avelumab) was evaluated&#xD;
      in a phase Ib expansion study (n=20, Japanese patients), with 15% of objective response rate&#xD;
      and 11.9 weeks for progression-free survival. A second cohort with avelumab included 55&#xD;
      patients for maintenance therapy after first-line chemotherapy, with 7.3% of objective&#xD;
      response rate and 14 weeks of PFS. Phase I/II CheckMate-032 evaluated nivolumab (anti-PD-1) ±&#xD;
      ipilimumab (anti-CTLA4) at different doses in advanced gastric cancer (17). The overall&#xD;
      response rate was between 8% to 24% and the median OS between 4.8 to 6.9 months according to&#xD;
      treatment arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Others anti-PD1/anti-PD-L1/anti-CTLA4 mAbs are also currently under investigation in gastric&#xD;
      cancer alone or in combination with chemotherapy. Nevertheless, up until now there is no&#xD;
      published data concerning ICI plus chemotherapy in gastric cancer. The present randomized&#xD;
      multicentric non-comparative phase II study aimed to assess the rate of patients alive and&#xD;
      without progression at 4 months with advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction (GEJ)&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma, pre-treated with fluoropyrimidine + platinum +/- taxane, with two arms&#xD;
      Folfiri plus durvalumab versus Folfiri plus durvalumab plus tremelimumab. Indeed, most&#xD;
      patients in the French multicentric first-line GASTFOX trial (506 patients planned between&#xD;
      2017 and 2020) can be included in the second-line setting in the DURIGAST trial. Due to the&#xD;
      lack of data concerning Folfiri plus durvalumab plus tremelimumab combination, a safety&#xD;
      run-in phase will be performed at the beginning of the DURIGAST trial.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Gastric adenocarcinoma is the fourth most frequent cancer and the second leading cause of&#xD;
      cancer mortality. Advanced gastric adenocarcinoma has a poor prognosis with short overall&#xD;
      survival (ranging from 10% to 15% at 5-years) even after surgical complete resection and&#xD;
      despite the progress in therapeutic approaches. Most of the patients have metastatic, locally&#xD;
      advanced or recurrent unresectable disease. So, systemic treatment remains an important issue&#xD;
      especially since chemotherapy improves survival and quality of life (compared to best&#xD;
      supportive care alone). First-line chemotherapy depends on HER2 status, which also influenced&#xD;
      overall survival (14 months for HER2 positive versus 10 months for HER2 negative tumors). In&#xD;
      HER2 negative tumors standard first-line regimen is a doublet of fluoropyrimidine&#xD;
      (5-fluorouracil or capecitabine) plus a platinum salt (cisplatin or oxaliplatin).&#xD;
      5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and capecitabine as also cisplatin and oxaliplatin have similar&#xD;
      efficacy but different toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients whose tumor overexpresses the HER2 receptor adding trastuzumab to&#xD;
      fluoropyrimidine/cisplatin regimen increased overall survival compared to chemotherapy alone.&#xD;
      In HER2 negative tumors the addition of docetaxel to cisplatin/fluoropyrimidine regimen&#xD;
      increased overall survival but its use remains limited in clinical practice because of its&#xD;
      high toxicity. Preliminary results demonstrated a high efficacy with less toxicities of&#xD;
      docetaxel-oxaliplatin-fluoropyrimidine combination, also called TFOX/FLOT regimen. Indeed, in&#xD;
      France a large phase III trial comparing TFOX versus FOLFOX in first-line treatment of&#xD;
      patients with advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma is ongoing&#xD;
      (GASTFOX, trial NCT03006432). Primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS) and 506&#xD;
      patients are planned between 2017 and 2020 (actually at the date of January 30, 2018, 65&#xD;
      patients are included).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second-line chemotherapy improves overall survival (OS) as compared to best supportive care&#xD;
      alone in patients with an acceptable general condition (performance status 0-2). Indeed, with&#xD;
      docetaxel monotherapy there was a significant difference in overall survival for the&#xD;
      chemotherapy arm with a median of 5.2 versus 3.6 months in best supportive care alone arm&#xD;
      (HR=0.67, p=0.01). Weekly paclitaxel monotherapy is also used because of its good&#xD;
      efficacy-toxicity ratio. Irinotecan monotherapy also significantly improves overall survival&#xD;
      compared to supportive care alone in a phase III study (4.0 versus 2.4 months; HR=0.48, 95%CI&#xD;
      0.25-0.92; p=0.012). Recently ramucirumab monotherapy demonstrated its efficacy on overall&#xD;
      survival in a randomized, placebo-controlled second-line metastatic study. In a randomized&#xD;
      phase 3 trial ramucirumab also showed its efficacy in combination with paclitaxel versus&#xD;
      paclitaxel monotherapy with a median overall survival of 9.6 versus 7.4 months, respectively&#xD;
      (p=0.017; HR=0.81). However, the &quot;amelioration du service medical rendu&quot; (ASMR) assessed by&#xD;
      the French &quot;Haute Autorité de Santé&quot; (HAS) consider an insufficient benefit to a&#xD;
      reimbursement of ramucirumab in France. The HAS gave a moderate ASMR opinion (ASMR IV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Docetaxel is more and more frequently used in first-line chemotherapy then in this setting&#xD;
      taxane (alone or combined with others drugs) cannot be used as second-line regimen. Indeed,&#xD;
      based on a phase III trial FOLFIRI (5-FU plus irinotecan) is one most used regimen in&#xD;
      second-line in European countries, especially in France. FFCD 0307 trial, a phase III&#xD;
      comparing FOLFIRI-ECX (epirubicin-cisplatin-capecitabine) to the reverse sequence&#xD;
      (ECX-FOLFIRI), showed that both sequences are possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human tumors tend to activate the immune system regulatory checkpoints as a means of escaping&#xD;
      immunosurveillance. For instance, interaction between PD1 (Program Death 1) and PD-L1&#xD;
      (Program Death 1 ligand) will lead the activated T cell to a state of anergy. PD-L1 is up&#xD;
      regulated on a wide range of cancers. Anti-PD1 and anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs),&#xD;
      called immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), have consequently been designed to restore T cell&#xD;
      activity. Others ICIs are investigated, notably cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4&#xD;
      (CTLA-4) inhibitors. CTLA-4 transmits an inhibitory signal to T cells to prevent early&#xD;
      excessive T cell activation. CTLA4 blockade may stimulate a more robust antitumor response by&#xD;
      sustaining activation and proliferation of T lymphocytes and may overcome immune suppression&#xD;
      mediated by regulatory T cells. ICIs have been recently tested in many cancers with promising&#xD;
      results, especially in tumors with microsatellite instability (MSI) and/or PD-L1&#xD;
      overexpression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary results in metastatic gastric cancer with anti-PD1 mAbs are highly promising. In&#xD;
      a trial with pembrolizumab, only PD-L1 positive tumors were eligible to the treatment with a&#xD;
      cut off at 1%. Thirty-nine patients were enrolled and 67% had received at least two prior&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimens. The overall response rate was 22%. The median PFS and OS were 1.9&#xD;
      months and 11.4 months, respectively. KEYNOTE-059 Phase 2 multicohort study with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab monotherapy in advanced gastric cancer treatment has been presented at ASCO&#xD;
      2017 meeting. Among 259 patients included in the trial response rate was 11.6%. OS was 5.6&#xD;
      months. Response rates were 15.5% in PDL1+ tumors versus 6.4% in PDL1- tumors and 57.1% in&#xD;
      MSI tumors versus 9% in MSS tumors. Up until now, overlap between microsatellite instability&#xD;
      and PD-L1 expression is unknown in gastric cancer. An anti-PD-L1 mAb (avelumab) was evaluated&#xD;
      in a phase Ib expansion study (n=20, Japanese patients), with 15% of objective response rate&#xD;
      and 11.9 weeks for progression-free survival. A second cohort with avelumab included 55&#xD;
      patients for maintenance therapy after first-line chemotherapy, with 7.3% of objective&#xD;
      response rate and 14 weeks of PFS. Phase I/II CheckMate-032 evaluated nivolumab (anti-PD-1) ±&#xD;
      ipilimumab (anti-CTLA4) at different doses in advanced gastric cancer (17). The overall&#xD;
      response rate was between 8% to 24% and the median OS between 4.8 to 6.9 months according to&#xD;
      treatment arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Others anti-PD1/anti-PD-L1/anti-CTLA4 mAbs are also currently under investigation in gastric&#xD;
      cancer alone or in combination with chemotherapy. Nevertheless, up until now there is no&#xD;
      published data concerning ICI plus chemotherapy in gastric cancer. Finally, immunogenic cell&#xD;
      death induced by chemotherapy may enhance efficacy of ICIs. Durvalumab (MEDI4736) is a human&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody directed against PD-L1 in development for the treatment of many cancers.&#xD;
      A phase I study included 16 patients with advanced gastric cancer and the objective response&#xD;
      rate was 25%. Tremelimumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody against CTLA-4. Durvalumab&#xD;
      plus tremelimumab combination showed a manageable tolerability profile, with antitumour&#xD;
      activity irrespective of PD-L1 status in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Durvalumab alone&#xD;
      or combined with tremelimumab is evaluated in phase III studies in NSCLC (e.g NEPTUNE and&#xD;
      MYSTIC), small cell lung cancer (CASPIAN), hepatocellular carcinoma (HIMALAYA), bladder&#xD;
      cancer (DANUBE) and head and neck cancer (EAGLE and KESTREL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concerning safety of anti-PD1 plus anti-CTLA4 combination, in the randomized phase I/II&#xD;
      CheckMate-032 study, that included 160 patients, there was no unexpected toxicity signal.&#xD;
      Grade 3 and 4 treatment-related adverse events were 17%, 47%, and 27%, respectively. These&#xD;
      rates of grade 3 and 4 treatment-related adverse events are those usually found with the&#xD;
      anti-PD1 plus anti-CTLA4 combination in other tumors, observed approximately in 40% of&#xD;
      patients. Up until now, there is no published data concerning combination of ICIs plus&#xD;
      irinotecan. Nevertheless, in all trial combining chemotherapy plus anti-PD1 and/or anti-CTLA4&#xD;
      chemotherapy drugs were used at full-dose (5FU, oxaliplatin, cisplatin…). An Italian trial&#xD;
      just started and combined full-dose FOLFOXIRI (5-FU 3200 mg/m2 plus irinotecan 165 mg/m2 and&#xD;
      oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2) with bevacizumab (5 mg/kg) and atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1, 840 mg) in&#xD;
      metastatic colorectal cancers as first-line treatment. FOLFOXIRI is a triplet chemotherapy&#xD;
      more &quot;toxic&quot; than FOLFIRI doublet chemotherapy and this trial is a randomized phase II&#xD;
      (FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab and atezolizumab versus FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab). There is,&#xD;
      however, a preliminary safety phase in 6 patients, once they have all received at least 2&#xD;
      cycles of treatment, the latter being administered at full dose (AtezoTRIBE trial,&#xD;
      NCT03721653).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present randomized multicentric non-comparative phase II study aimed to assess the rate&#xD;
      of patients alive and without progression at 4 months with advanced gastric or&#xD;
      gastro-oesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma, pre-treated with fluoropyrimidine +&#xD;
      platinum +/- taxane, with two arms Folfiri plus durvalumab versus Folfiri plus durvalumab&#xD;
      plus tremelimumab. Indeed, most patients in the French multicentric first-line GASTFOX trial&#xD;
      (506 patients planned between 2017 and 2020) can be included in the second-line setting in&#xD;
      the DURIGAST trial. Due to the lack of data concerning Folfiri plus durvalumab plus&#xD;
      tremelimumab combination, a safety run-in phase will be performed at the beginning of the&#xD;
      DURIGAST trial.&#xD;
