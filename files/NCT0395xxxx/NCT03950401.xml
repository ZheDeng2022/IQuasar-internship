      The investigators will compare the early postoperative outcome of wound closure technique in&#xD;
      carpal tunnel release using Nylon sutures versus subcuticular Monocryl sutures. The&#xD;
      investigators plan to randomize patients across three hand surgeons who will perform both&#xD;
      techniques, and will survey the patients satisfaction of pain and appearance at 2 and 6 weeks&#xD;
      postoperatively.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to determine if there is a significant difference in&#xD;
      provider-assessed and patient-assessed outcomes using subcuticular Monocryl vs traditional&#xD;
      Nylon sutures for wound closure following open carpal tunnel decompression surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null hypothesis: There is no significant difference in provider-assessed or patient-assessed&#xD;
      outcomes, as measured by the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS), between&#xD;
      subcuticular Monocryl and traditional nylon wound closure methods after open carpal tunnel&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternative hypothesis: Using a running subcuticular Monocryl suture for wound closure&#xD;
      following open carpal tunnel release will result in significantly improved POSAS scores in&#xD;
      comparison to traditional nylon wound closure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open carpal tunnel decompression surgery is a common procedure, but controversy still exists&#xD;
      regarding what wound closure method optimizes wound healing, cosmetic and patient&#xD;
      satisfaction outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research concerning the superiority of absorbable or non-absorbable sutures in the setting of&#xD;
      wound closure for carpal tunnel decompression surgery is largely inconclusive, due to high&#xD;
      risk of bias in previous comparison trials. Although some studies suggest that absorbable&#xD;
      sutures confer a higher risk of infection, other studies suggest that absorbable sutures&#xD;
      confer superior pain reduction, and still others suggest use of non-absorbable sutures due to&#xD;
      reduced cost, both with respect to materials and by avoiding an additional clinician visit&#xD;
      for suture removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A rigorous randomized trial of absorbable versus non-absorbable sutures as wound closure&#xD;
      methods following minor elective hand surgery procedures is indicated, to compare wound&#xD;
      healing, cosmesis, patient-reported outcome measures, as well as cost for each method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Timelines:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be enrolled either at their pre-operative clinic visit or on the day of&#xD;
      their surgery in the preoperative holding area (PHA). They will receive 2 follow-up&#xD;
      appointments at 10-14 days and 6 weeks, after the surgery. Patients are considered enrolled&#xD;
      in the study until after their 6-week appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The power analysis will use alpha = 0.05 and beta (power) = 0.8. Using the Fleisher et al.&#xD;
      paper, the mean Observer Scar Assessment Scale (OSAS) was 12 Â± 3 for the suture group (p &lt;&#xD;
      0.01), and the mean for the staple group was 13. If the investigators expect to see a similar&#xD;
      difference between absorbable versus non-absorbable sutures, based on a two-sample t-test&#xD;
      they would have to enroll 141 patients in each arm to have an 80% chance of seeing a&#xD;
      difference at least this large, if there truly is one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is anticipated that a small percentage of patients will drop out of the study prior to&#xD;
      completing their study endpoints. If the study allows for an approximate 15% dropout rate,&#xD;
      then the investigators will plan to enroll 325 patients to ensure appropriate power. Looking&#xD;
      at the surgeon numbers, each of the primary surgeons perform between 50-90 carpal tunnel&#xD;
      surgeries per year. Therefore, the investigators estimate a 2.5 year enrollment period,&#xD;
      followed by a six-month data review period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study endpoint for subjects is a completed POSAS surveys at 6 weeks after their&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no safety endpoints, as the study consists of a single intervention and both&#xD;
      closure methods are well described and well tolerated (non-experimental).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures Involved:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be identified by the operating surgeon (Dr. Szabo, Dr. Bayne or Dr. Allen) and&#xD;
      enrolled either at their pre-operative clinic visit or in the preoperative holding area on&#xD;
      the day of their surgery by either the operating surgeon or research personnel. After signing&#xD;
      consent, the consenting researcher will use a digital Randomizer application (&quot;Randomizer&quot;,&#xD;
      available on all smart phones) to assign the individual to either Subcuticular Monocryl wound&#xD;
      closure or traditional nylon wound closure. After being randomized, the study arm will be&#xD;
      noted at the top of their consents and the consent scanned into the patient's electronic&#xD;
      medical record. The hard copy consents will be stored securely as outlined below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo surgery with the assigned wound closure. At each follow-up appointment&#xD;
      (at approximately 2 and 6 weeks), patients and their operating physician will be given the&#xD;
      POSAS questionnaire. In addition, patients will be asked the following question: &quot;How&#xD;
      satisfied are you with the results of the carpal tunnel surgery and recovery?&quot; Assessed using&#xD;
      a 5-point scale: completely satisfied (1 point), very satisfied (2 point), rather satisfied&#xD;
      (3 point), dissatisfied (4 point), and completely dissatisfied (5 point).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes of the POSAS and satisfaction question will be complied into a research database and&#xD;
      the de-identified data will be analyzed for significant differences between Subcuticular&#xD;
      Monocryl and traditional nylon methods of wound closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the data analysis phase of the study, a cost comparison will be performed, examining&#xD;
      the cost of materials for each arm (assuming one suture packet used per patient). The&#xD;
      investigators will also consider the cost differential in follow up visits, if patients&#xD;
      closed with absorbable Monocryl sutures could be limited to one 6-week follow up visit,&#xD;
      versus the nylon closure patients which would need an additional early visit for suture&#xD;
      removal. No protected health information will need to be examined for this analysis.&#xD;

    <description>As measured by a questionnaire completed by the clinic physician assistant. The observer scale of the POSAS consists of six items (vascularity, pigmentation, thickness, relief, pliability and surface area). All items are scored on a scale ranging from 1 ('like normal skin') to 10 ('worst scar imaginable'). The sum of the six items results in a total score of the POSAS observer scale.
