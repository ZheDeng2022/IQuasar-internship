      1703: The study is designed as a randomized, phase III, multicenter trial comparing two acute&#xD;
      graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) prophylaxis regimens: tacrolimus/methotrexate (Tac/MTX)&#xD;

      the setting of reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell&#xD;
      (PBSC) transplantation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      1703: Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD) is a complication that affects many hematopoietic stem&#xD;
      cell transplant (HSCT) patients; it occurs when the new cells from a transplant attack the&#xD;
      recipient's body. The current standard GVHD prophylaxis regimen for patients with hematologic&#xD;
      malignancies undergoing HSCT involves a combination of immunosuppressive agents given for the&#xD;
      first 6 months after transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard strategy of Tacrolimus/Methotrexate will be used as a control arm in comparison&#xD;
      to one other treatment plan utilizing Tacrolimus/Mycophenolate Mofetil/Post-Transplant&#xD;
      Cyclophosphamide. Study participants will receive an infusion of mobilized peripheral blood&#xD;
      stem cell grafts on both arms. Study participants will be randomized to one of these two&#xD;
      treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1801: A relationship between the intestinal microbiota and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)&#xD;
      has long been appreciated but is still not well understood. Mice transplanted in germ-free&#xD;
      conditions or treated with gut-decontaminating antibiotics developed less severe GVHD.&#xD;
      Clinical studies initially suggested a benefit from near-total bacterial decontamination, but&#xD;
      later showed no clear benefit and this approach was discontinued in the early 1990s. Partial&#xD;
      gut decontamination continues to be practiced at many centers. More recently, the advent of&#xD;
      next-generation sequencing (NGS) has resulted in cheaper and easier characterization of&#xD;
      complex microbial mixtures. This has led to a renewed interest in evaluating the relationship&#xD;
      between the microbiota and human health and disease, including recipients of hematopoietic&#xD;
      cell transplantation (HCT). Similarly, NGS has also contributed to significant advancements&#xD;
      in the investigator's understanding of immune reconstitution in HCT patients and how this may&#xD;
      impact clinica outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this protocol is to test the primary hypothesis that the engraftment stool&#xD;
      microbiome diversity predicts one-year non-relapse mortality in patients undergoing reduced&#xD;
      intensity allogeneic HCT.&#xD;
