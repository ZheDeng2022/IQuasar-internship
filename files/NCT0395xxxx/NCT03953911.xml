  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infections with human papillomavirus (HPV) can cause cancer of the cervix, vagina, anus,&#xD;
      throat, mouth, and penis. Prevention of these HPV-related cancers could be achieved by&#xD;
      immunization with the nonavalent (HPV6,11,16,18,31,33,45,52,58) vaccine currently&#xD;
      commercially available. However, in the U.S. approximately only 30% of females and 20% of&#xD;
      males in the recommended age group receive the complete, three-dose HPV vaccine. Furthermore,&#xD;
      data from the Los Angeles county suggest that HPV vaccination rates among these groups are&#xD;
      lower than the national average. Significant barriers clearly remain including knowledge of&#xD;
      the vaccine, transportation, number of doses and concern of side effects. Several programs&#xD;
      worldwide have shown that schools remain an important venue for education as well as&#xD;
      vaccination. In the US, vaccination within schools remains difficult because of many barriers&#xD;
      including lack of nursing, insurance reimbursement, and liability. However, the school&#xD;
      remains an important access to educational formats. The objective of this study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness of educational sessions on the HPV vaccine among parents with&#xD;
      children of vaccination age as a strategy to increase HPV vaccine uptake, by comparing HPV&#xD;
      vaccination rates before and after the intervention. It is hypothesized HPV vaccine uptake&#xD;
      will improve through the receipt of educational sessions to the parents of middle school&#xD;
      children about the importance of the anti-cancer vaccine, the HPV vaccine. Three schools&#xD;
      within Cedars-Sinai catchment area with whom Cedars-Sinai already has a Memorandum of&#xD;
      Understanding in place: Berendo, Drew, and Carver Middle Schools in Los Angeles (SPA 4, SPA&#xD;
      6) will be recruited to the study. HPV vaccination rates will be compared before and after&#xD;
      the intervention at the end of the observation period (12 months).&#xD;

      Rationale and Significance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infections with human papillomavirus (HPV) can cause cancer of the cervix, vagina, anus,&#xD;
      throat, mouth, and penis. Prevention of these HPV-related cancers could be achieved by&#xD;
      immunization with the nonavalent (HPV6,11,16,18,31,33,45,52,58) vaccine currently&#xD;
      commercially available. However, in the U.S. approximately only 30% of females and 20% of&#xD;
      males in the recommended age group receive the complete, three-dose HPV vaccine. The vaccine&#xD;
      is covered under Vaccine for Children Program so the underinsured and uninsured have access.&#xD;
      Furthermore, data from the Los Angeles county suggest that HPV vaccination rates among these&#xD;
      groups are lower than the national average. Significant barriers clearly remain including&#xD;
      knowledge of the vaccine, transportation, number of doses and concern of side effects.&#xD;
      Several programs worldwide have shown that schools remain an important venue for education as&#xD;
      well as vaccination. In the US, vaccination within schools remains difficult because of many&#xD;
      barriers including lack of nursing, insurance reimbursement, and liability. However, the&#xD;
      school remain an important access to educational formats. Barriers associated with the HPV&#xD;
      vaccine uptake is the initial stigmatizing information created by anti-vaccine groups,&#xD;
      providers not recommending the vaccine and not understanding the cancer prevention strategies&#xD;
      (i.e. getting vaccination prior to exposure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Barriers to HPV vaccination&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the US has invested in a large national effort toward improvement of HPV vaccination&#xD;
      rates, little progress has been achieved since 2006. While financial access should not be a&#xD;
      barrier to vaccination for most children, some insurance plans do not cover vaccines. Several&#xD;
      factors appear to influence vaccination rates: a) limited understanding of HPV and&#xD;
      HPV-related diseases by parents and patients; b) parental safety concerns about the vaccine;&#xD;
      c) provider discomfort talking about sexual behavior; d) providers lack of time for&#xD;
      discussions about the vaccine; e) parental perception that there is no clear recommendation&#xD;
      from a health care provider; f) parental belief that son or daughter is too young for the&#xD;
      vaccine because they are not sexually active; and g) provider concern that there is lack of&#xD;
      adequate reimbursement. In LA County, lack of knowledge that a cancer vaccine exists, lack of&#xD;
      transportation, and fear of immigration status disclosure are further barriers to&#xD;
      vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize HPV vaccine uptake will be improved through the receipt of educational&#xD;
      sessions to the parents of middle school children about the importance of the anti-cancer&#xD;
      vaccine, the HPV vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Such sessions will increase knowledge about HPV vaccine availability, as well as improve the&#xD;
      perceptions around HPV vaccination. Vaccination rates are lower in the Service Planning areas&#xD;
      (SPA) 4 and 6 compared to SAP 5 (West LA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the ability of educational sessions about the HPV vaccine to increase HPV vaccine&#xD;
      uptake, by comparing HPV vaccination rates before and after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be HPV vaccination rates. Vaccination rates will be compared between&#xD;
      before (baseline) and after the intervention at the end of the observation period (12&#xD;
      months). We expect to find higher HPV vaccine rates after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will recruit 3 schools within Cedars-Sinai catchment area with whom Cedars-Sinai already&#xD;
      has a Memorandum of Understanding in place: Berendo, Drew, and Carver Middle Schools in Los&#xD;
      Angeles (SPA 4, SPA 6). These MOUs were obtained through the Cedars-Sinai Coach-for Kids&#xD;
      Program Director, Michele Rigsby-Pauley, a co-investigator in this study. We will first&#xD;
      conduct focus group interviews with parents to learn about parents' concerns about the HPV&#xD;
      vaccine and to identify important messages for parents. These would also include strategies&#xD;
      for dissemination of information (PTA meetings, text messages to parents, online education).&#xD;
      HPV vaccination rates will be compared before and after the intervention at the end of the&#xD;
      observation period (12 months).&#xD;
