    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate effect of benralizumab on structural and lung&#xD;
      function changes in severe eosinophilic asthmatics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes will be assessed over 48 week treatment period in patients with persistent symptoms&#xD;
      despite standard therapy of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) plus long acting B2-agonist (LABA)&#xD;
      with or without additional controller medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who complete treatment will enter 4 weeks follow-up period&#xD;
