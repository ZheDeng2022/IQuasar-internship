      This is an open-label, Phase 1b/2 trial for adults with advanced melanoma. The objective of&#xD;
      the Phase 1b portion of the study is to establish the recommended Phase 2 dose of&#xD;
      cabozantinib in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with unresectable melanoma and&#xD;
      assess the safety and tolerability of the combined treatments. The objective of the Phase 2&#xD;
      portion of the study is to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of the established dose of&#xD;
      cabozantinib in combination with pembrolizumab as measured by best overall response rate&#xD;
      (ORR) (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR]) with the combination of agents in&#xD;
      patients with unresectable stage III or stage IV melanoma.&#xD;

        if necessary&#xD;
&#xD;
        Hepatic Serum total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 X ULN Patients with a total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 X ULN will&#xD;
        not be excluded if Direct bilirubin &gt;/= ULN&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        * Cardiovascular: The subject has a corrected QT interval calculated by the Fridericia&#xD;
        formula (QTcF) &gt;/= 500ms within 14 days before Cycle 1 Day 1. Ejection fraction on Echo or&#xD;
        MUGA &lt;/= 50%. NYHA class &gt;/= 3. Note: If a single ECG show a QTcF with an absolute value&#xD;
        &lt;/= 500 ms, two additional ECGs at intervals of approximately 2 min must be performed&#xD;
        within 30 min after the initial ECG, and the average of these three consecutive results for&#xD;
        QTcF will be used to determine eligibility.&#xD;
