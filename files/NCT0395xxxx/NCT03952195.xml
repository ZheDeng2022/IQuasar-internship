  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Procedure is offered today to most patients with chronic ulcerative colitis (CUC) or familial&#xD;
      adenomatous polyposis (FAP) who are candidates for total proctocolectomy. While high rates of&#xD;
      successful pouch surgery are reported, there is a significant long-term risk of pouch-related&#xD;
      complications including ileo-anal anastomotic separation and stricture, pouch-perineal and&#xD;
      pouch-vaginal fistula, pouchitis, pelvic sepsis, small bowel obstruction, and pouch&#xD;
      dysfunction. Despite recent advances in treatment of these complications by medical and&#xD;
      surgical means, these problems can still lead to pouch failure and pouch excision. The&#xD;
      long-term rate of pouch excision is reported in large series to range from 5.3% to 24%.&#xD;
      Moreover, the burden of quality of life impairment on patients with these complications is&#xD;
      immense. Pouch excision operations are technically difficult with substantial morbidity. This&#xD;
      study aimed to investigate the indications for pouch excision, the number of salvage&#xD;
      operations prior to these excisions and complications of pouch excision surgeries.&#xD;

      Data Collection Data were collected by retrospective review of a single institution, single&#xD;
      practice, prospectively maintained clinical database consisting of 1263 patients undergoing&#xD;
      RPC with IPAA performed between 1981 and 2015. All cases of pouch excision were identified.&#xD;
      The recorded data comprised of patient demographic details, pathologic diagnoses at the time&#xD;
      of pouch formation and pouch excision, details on the surgical procedures performed including&#xD;
      formation of the pouch, procedures performed attempting to salvage the pouch, excision of the&#xD;
      pouch, and intraoperative and early (within 30 days after pouch excision surgery)&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pouch Salvage Surgery The type and date of all pouch salvage surgical interventions performed&#xD;
      under general anesthesia prior to pouch excision were documented and categorized. We&#xD;
      documented and classified each trip to the operating room as a salvage encounter. Salvage&#xD;
      procedures were defined as any surgical intervention performed to preserve the pouch and did&#xD;
      not include procedures unrelated to the pouch, such as incisional hernia repairs. Operative&#xD;
      salvage procedures included abscess drainage with incision and drainage of an abscess cavity&#xD;
      and curettage of peri-pouch abscesses or fistula tracts. Fistula repair included any repair&#xD;
      of peri-pouch fistulae including seton placement and advancement flap. Any transanal or&#xD;
      abdominal repair or revision of the pouch including the pouch-anal anastomosis was classified&#xD;
      as a pouch revision. Diversion was defined as the formation of any unplanned diverting loop&#xD;
      ileostomy. Ileostomy reversal was defined as the restoration of continuity following an&#xD;
      unplanned diversion. Loop ileostomies formed or reversed as part of a planned, staged RPC&#xD;
      procedure were excluded. Other procedures included dilatation of the IPAA anastomosis with&#xD;
      examination under anesthesia (EUA), formation of an entero-pouch bypass, and any resections&#xD;
      of peri-pouch cysts or desmoids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indications for Pouch Excision Indications for pouch excision were based on documented&#xD;
      preoperative clinical and histopathologic diagnoses. Pouch dysfunction was defined as stool&#xD;
      incontinence with or without obstructed defecation. Pouchitis was separately defined as&#xD;
      clinical symptoms of bleeding, cramping abdominal pain, anal discharge, tenesmus, urgency,&#xD;
      and increased frequency of defecation [10]. Distinguishing between pouchitis and pouch&#xD;
      dysfunction was based on the operating surgeon's preoperative clinical diagnosis rather than&#xD;
      pathology. Septic complications included any pelvic, perineal, or perianal infection as a&#xD;
      result of anastomotic dehiscence, abscess or persistent fistula arising from the pouch or&#xD;
      IPAA. Other indications for pouch excision included cancer diagnosed from endoscopic biopsy&#xD;
      or found at surgery. Pouch necrosis was defined as complete transmural ischemia of the pouch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary Measures and Statistical Analyses. Summary statistics of continuous variables&#xD;
      reported the mean and standard deviation (SD) and the median and interquartile range (IQR) as&#xD;
      appropriate. Pouch survival was defined as the time between pouch formation and pouch&#xD;
      excision surgeries. The rate of salvage encounters was calculated by the sum of all&#xD;
      encounters in the operating room where the primary surgery was to salvage the pouch divided&#xD;
      by the number of patients. Differences in pouch survival by indication for pouch excision&#xD;
      were compared using log-rank test. Statistical significance was defined as P&lt;0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Excluded and Missing Data Missing data were not included in the analyses. One patient with&#xD;
      FAP had her pouch formed in our center, sought care at an outside institution for her pouch&#xD;
      excision and the indication for pouch excision was unknown. However, data collected at the&#xD;
      time of pouch formation and salvage procedures performed on this patient prior to excision&#xD;
      were available and included in the analyses. Another patient developed pouch necrosis two&#xD;
      weeks after pouch formation surgery, the pouch was never functional, and this patient was not&#xD;
      included in our analyses of pouch survival or salvage encounter rates.&#xD;
