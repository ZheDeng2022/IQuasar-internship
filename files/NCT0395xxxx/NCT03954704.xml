  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For Phase 1a Part A, the primary objectives are to assess safety and tolerability and to&#xD;
      define the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended Phase&#xD;
      2 dose (RP2D) of GS-1423 monotherapy in participants with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Phase 1a Part B, the primary objective is to assess safety and tolerability of GS-1423&#xD;
      monotherapy in participants with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Phase 1b Cohort 1 safety run-in, the primary objective is to assess safety and&#xD;
      tolerability and to define the DLT and MTD or RP2D of GS-1423 in combination with a&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimen in participants with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Phase 1b Cohort 1 post safety run-in, the primary objective is to assess the preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy of GS-1423 in combination with a chemotherapy regimen in participants with advanced&#xD;
      gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, as assessed by the confirmed objective&#xD;
      response rate (ORR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Phase 1b Cohort 2, the primary objective is to assess safety and tolerability of GS-1423&#xD;
      monotherapy in participants with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;

    <arm_group_label>Phase 1a, Part A - Dose Escalation</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Part A will consist of dose escalation by an accelerated dosing design and a 3+3 dose escalation scheme. Participants will receive escalating dose levels GS-1423 of up to 45 mg/kg on Day 1 of each 2-week cycle (Q2W) until the participants meets study treatment discontinuation criteria or for up to 1 year.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Part B will consist of 3 adaptive cohorts. Based on PK, pharmacodynamics, and safety results from the Part A study, participants will be administered a flat dose of GS-1423 on Day 1 of each cycle QW, Q2W and/or every 3 weeks (Q3W) until the participant meets study treatment discontinuation criteria or for up to 1 year.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Phase 1b, Cohort 1 (Gastric Cancer)</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Safety run-in: A standard 3+3 dose escalation design will be used to determine the DLT and MTD or RP2D of GS-1423 in combination with mFOLFOX6. The planned starting dose of GS-1423 will be targeted to achieve the exposure at -1 dose of RP2D monotherapy (Q2W) determined from Phase 1a. GS-1423 will be administered in combination with mFOLFOX6.&#xD;
Post safety run-in: Approximately 70 participants will be enrolled to receive GS-1423 at the dose level determined from the safety run-in period, in combination with mFOLFOX6 regimen.&#xD;
Participants will receive GS-1423 on Day 1 of each 14-day cycle up to 2 years until PD, or unacceptable toxicity, substantial noncompliance with study procedures or study drug, study discontinuation or withdrawal from study. Participants will also receive mFOLFOX6 regimen Q2W for up to 12 cycles.</description>
