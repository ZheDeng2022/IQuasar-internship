  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metabolic abnormalities (e.g., hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and obesity)&#xD;
      and unhealthy lifestyle behaviors (e.g., smoking and drinking habits, sedentary behavior,&#xD;
      sleep disorder and physical inactivity) and unhealthy diet (e.g., high sugar and high fat)&#xD;
      are major risk factors for cardiovascular diseases mobility and mortality. The investigators&#xD;
      sought to estimate the impact of metabolic abnormalities, lifestyle behavior and diet pattern&#xD;
      on prognosis of heart failure. This study planned to consecutively enroll 1,500 participants&#xD;
      with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and heart failure with mid-range ejection&#xD;
      fraction fulfilling the inclusion criteria. Each heart failure survivors will be followed up&#xD;
      for 5 years. Information on metabolic diseases, lifestyle and diet pattern were obtained&#xD;
      through standardized questionnaire. The major adverse cardiac events will be identified by&#xD;
      reviewing pertinent medical records and discharge lists from the hospitals, or official death&#xD;
      certificates collected at local death registration centers, or directly contacting&#xD;
      participants' family. The Cox proportional hazard model will be used to assess the&#xD;
      association between metabolic risk factors and lifestyle and diet habits and health outcomes&#xD;
      in heart failure patients.&#xD;
