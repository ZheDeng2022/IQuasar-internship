  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the safety and efficacy of the investigational use of the&#xD;
      HydraSolve T2D™ System in improving blood glucose control and insulin resistance in patients&#xD;
      with obesity (Class 1, BMI 30-39.9 kg/m2) and type 2 diabetes who have not achieved targeted&#xD;
      levels of blood glucose control using oral diabetes medications. The previously FDA-cleared&#xD;
      (for liposuction and fat transfer) HydraSolve T2D™ System will be used to perform a novel,&#xD;
      minimally invasive laparoscopic and mini-laparotomy procedure to selectively remove excess&#xD;
      intra-abdominal fat from the mesentery (Mesenteric Visceral Lipectomy (MVL)), while not&#xD;
      affecting surrounding tissues. The study will include several weeks of screening for&#xD;
      eligibility before the intervention, and 12-months of follow-up post-surgery.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the investigational use of the HydraSolve T2D™ System (previously&#xD;
      FDA-cleared for liposuction and fat transfer) to perform a novel, minimally invasive&#xD;
      laparoscopic and mini-laparotomy procedure to selectively remove intra-abdominal fat from the&#xD;
      mesentery and to assess the resulting changes in blood glucose control, insulin sensitivity&#xD;
      and body weight. Excess intra-abdominal mesenteric fat has been directly linked to insulin&#xD;
      resistance, an important precursor of type 2 diabetes. Up to 30 study candidates will undergo&#xD;
      screening and eligibility testing over a 5-week period from which 12 will be enrolled to&#xD;
      undergo the procedure. During the 12-month period post-procedure, the patients will be&#xD;
      periodically monitored for improvements in blood glucose control (HbA1c, oral glucose&#xD;
      tolerance test (OGTT), fasting blood glucose (FBG) and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)),&#xD;
      insulin resistance (hyperinsulinemic euglycemic glucose clamp), body weight, changes in fat&#xD;
      deposits (Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) and&#xD;
      Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA)) and overall metabolic health (including indirect&#xD;
      calorimetry and various biomarkers). This prospective, single-arm study uses pre-operative&#xD;
      patient data as the control. Safety assessments and monitoring for adverse events will be&#xD;
      performed, throughout.&#xD;
