  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study evaluates the efficacy of the CAN DO Program for improving health, wellness, and&#xD;
      quality of life in people with MS, and compares outcomes between people with MS who&#xD;
      participate in the CAN DO Program to a control group of people with MS who do not participate&#xD;
      in the CAN DO Program. The study also evaluates the impact of the CAN DO Program on support&#xD;
      partners.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Can Do MS Programs offer evidence-based, comprehensive, and personalized educational and&#xD;
      experiential opportunities aimed at empowering and enabling a person with MS to live a&#xD;
      healthy life beyond their MS. The signature program of Can Do MS is the four-day CAN DOÂ®&#xD;
      Program (CAN DO). Preliminary outcomes suggest that participation in CAN DO leads to&#xD;
      significant improvements in self-efficacy and various aspects of health status.1 The majority&#xD;
      of 129 participants who participated in one of the three CAN DO Programs showed improvements&#xD;
      in self-efficacy at one month (n=98), 3 months (n=84), and 6 months after the program (n=82;&#xD;
      all p&lt;0.001). Participants also showed significant improvements to varying degrees in&#xD;
      subscales of the SF-36, including Physical Functioning (p=0.01), Role Physical, General&#xD;
      Health, Vitality and Mental Health. These improvements were maintained to varying extents at&#xD;
      one and 3 months post-program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These important outcomes have not yet been compared to those in people with MS who receive&#xD;
      traditional care but do not participate in this comprehensive educational opportunity.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the impact on physical activity, participation, and quality of life has not been&#xD;
      measured or compared to those who do not participate in CAN DO. Finally, recognizing the&#xD;
      tremendous burden that can be placed on the support partner living and supporting a person&#xD;
      with MS, education for support partners is another critical element of CAN DO. However, the&#xD;
      impact on the support partner of empowering an individual with MS to adopt healthy behaviors&#xD;
      also has not been assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will allow Shepherd Center and Can Do MS to gather long-term health, wellness,&#xD;
      and quality of life outcomes in people with MS and their support partners, as well as pilot&#xD;
      data evaluating this study design for future larger scale clinical trials. Demonstrating the&#xD;
      efficacy of this program will provide evidence that will impact the lives of people with MS&#xD;
      and their families, specifically, their ability to live healthy lives independent of their&#xD;
      MS.&#xD;
