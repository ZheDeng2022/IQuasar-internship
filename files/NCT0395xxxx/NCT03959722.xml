    <textblock>
      A double-blind randomized, placebo-controlled study will be performed with experienced&#xD;
      endurance athletes to assess the effect of probiotics supplementation on the occurrence and&#xD;
      intensity of the gastrointestinal symptoms, on performance and on the composition and&#xD;
      function of the gut microbiota. The duration of the supplementation period, with Ecologic®&#xD;
      PERFORMANCE supplements, is fourteen weeks. Standardized maximum exercise tests on a&#xD;
      treadmill are performed before and after the supplementation period, as well as two&#xD;
      performance tests (before) and one performance test (after). During the performance tests,&#xD;
      the load is first submaximal for 1 hour, after which a time trial of 30 minutes will be&#xD;
      performed. The measurements before and after the supplementation period are performed on&#xD;
      individual days with at least 48 hours of relative rest in between. During the&#xD;
      supplementation period, training diaries, a Profile of Mood States (POMS) questionnaire and a&#xD;
      few questionnaires about dietary habits will be completed.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Rationale: Endurance exercise, such as running a marathon, is becoming increasingly popular.&#xD;
      In addition to the many positive health effects of endurance exercise, it can also be&#xD;
      accompanied by gastrointestinal symptoms. For example, around 30-90% of runners suffer from&#xD;
      gastrointestinal symptoms during or in the hours after intensive/endurance running. The&#xD;
      occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms is probably due to the redistribution of blood&#xD;
      volume, resulting in less blood supply to the digestive tract and a less functioning&#xD;
      intestinal barrier. Because the intestinal barrier functions less, endotoxins can enter the&#xD;
      bloodstream and cause inflammatory reactions. Running in the heat causes extra redistribution&#xD;
      of the blood volume, because extra blood is needed for cooling of the body. It is known that&#xD;
      the gut microbiota affect food digestion, but also the functioning of the cells that line the&#xD;
      intestinal wall and the connections between these cells. It is possible that runners with&#xD;
      gastrointestinal symptoms face a different composition of the gut microbiota and / or&#xD;
      metabolites during endurance exercise compared to runners without any complaints, as a result&#xD;
      of which the gut barrier functions less well and problems may occur. Many positive effects&#xD;
      have been attributed to the use of probiotics in general. Amongst which, the reduction of&#xD;
      gastrointestinal symptoms during endurance exercise, probably due to improvement in&#xD;
      intestinal permeability. Hence, the main goal of our research project is to investigate&#xD;
      whether the chance of and/or intensity of gastrointestinal symptoms during endurance exercise&#xD;
      and the exercise performance can be influenced by probiotics supplementation in trained&#xD;
      endurance athletes. This will be studied in relation to the composition of the gut microbiota&#xD;
      and / or metabolites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Can the chance at and/or intensity of gastrointestinal symptoms during exercise be influenced&#xD;
      by probiotics supplementation in trained endurance athletes who experience these symptoms and&#xD;
      can performance be enhanced? Secondairy Objective: Can the composition and function of the&#xD;
      gut microbiota of trained athletes that experience gastrointestinal symptoms during exercise&#xD;
      be positively influenced by probiotics supplementation?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial will be performed to&#xD;
      investigate the effect of 14 weeks probiotics supplementation with Ecologic® PERFORMANCE&#xD;
      supplements. Standardized maximal incremental exercise tests will be performed before and&#xD;
      after the supplementation period, as well as two performance tests (before) and one&#xD;
      performance test (after). During the supplementation period training diaries, a POMS&#xD;
      questionnaire and some questionnaires about food habits will be completed, a food diary and&#xD;
      Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Healthy male endurance athletes of Dutch nationality, 18-45 years old, who&#xD;
      regularly experience gastrointestinal symptoms during exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Fourteen weeks of supplementation with Ecologic® PERFORMANCE probiotics&#xD;
      supplements (or placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: Main study endpoints are differences in changes in the&#xD;
      severity and occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms and changes in exercise performance&#xD;
      (total distance on a time trial and maximum speed during an incremental exercise test). Also&#xD;
      changes in composition of the microbiota and differences in changes in the metabolites in the&#xD;
      stool sample before and after the supplementation period in the experimental and control&#xD;
      group will be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: Benefits will be the value of the test results and outcome measures of the&#xD;
      microbiome analysis. Also the chance on a reduced risk of occurrence of gastrointestinal&#xD;
      symptoms might be of value for potential participants. The risks for the participants are&#xD;
      minor. Only participants that are healthy and endurance trained will be included. In the&#xD;
      Human Performance Laboratory of the Faculty of Behavioural and Human Movement Sciences,&#xD;
      performance tests in warm conditions are executed regularly and health risks related to the&#xD;
      experimental protocol are minor for the participants since they are already well-trained and&#xD;
      the exercise intensity will be relatively well-tolerated, since they are used to similar&#xD;
      efforts. Probiotics supplements are freely available at the market, and the Ecologic®&#xD;
      PERFORMANCE supplements are available in the web shop of Winclove B.V. The same supplement&#xD;
      has been used before in the same dosage and no adverse effects were reported. Participants&#xD;
      will fill in a food frequency questionnaire and questionnaire about gastrointestinal symptoms&#xD;
      and hand in a stool sample before and after the supplementation period. They will be asked to&#xD;
      maintain a training diary during the supplementation period and also fill in the POMS&#xD;
      questionnaire weekly. The maximal incremental exercise test (2 times) consists of a&#xD;
      warming-up followed by incremental increase in running velocity until voluntary exhaustion.&#xD;
      The performance tests (3 times) consists of 60 minutes of submaximal running followed by a&#xD;
      time trial of 30 minutes in which participants need to accomplish as much distance as&#xD;
      possible.&#xD;
