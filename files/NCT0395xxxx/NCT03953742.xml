  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label, single arm, non-randomized study of CPI-200 in patients&#xD;
      with advanced tumors. CPI-200 is administered via intravenous infusion using an accelerated&#xD;
      titration method followed by a conventional 3 + 3 study design to identify the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD)&#xD;
    </textblock>

      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To determine the safety, tolerability and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CPI-200 in&#xD;
      patients with advanced tumors&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of CPI-200&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate clinical response and resolution of symptoms after CPI-200 treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize adverse events of CPI-200 in patients with advanced cancers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 7 dose levels of CPI-200 will be tested using an accelerated titration method followed&#xD;
      by a conventional 3 + 3 dose escalation study design. MTD will be defined as the dose&#xD;
      associated with a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in less than or equal to 33% of patients at&#xD;
      the dose level tested. Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as one of the following events&#xD;
      occurring from the intravenous injection of CPI-200 within 21 days:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All Grade 4 or greater adverse events as determined by CTCAEv5 criteria, excluding&#xD;
           toxicities clearly related to disease progression or inter-current illness&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any Grade 3 or greater non-hematologic, non-dermatologic toxicity with the exception of&#xD;
           Grade 3 nausea, vomiting or diarrhea if lasting less than 72 hours, alopecia, or Grade 3&#xD;
           fatigue if lasting less than 7 days as determined by CTCAEv5 criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grade 3 thrombocytopenia in the presence of bleeding&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grade 3 or greater febrile neutropenia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any hematologic or non-hematologic adverse events or abnormal laboratory value(s)&#xD;
           related to CPI-200 that result(s) in permanent study discontinuation of study treatment&#xD;
