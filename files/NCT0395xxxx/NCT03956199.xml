  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to compare two methods of repairing and saving a badly damaged or infected&#xD;
      tooth. One method is called root canal treatment (RoCT) and the other (new method) is called&#xD;
      pulpotomy. RoCT involves removing the damaged area of the tooth including the tooth nerve&#xD;
      (called the pulp), cleaning, disinfecting and sealing it. Pulpotomy however attempts to&#xD;
      preserve as much of the tooth nerve as possible (keeping the tooth alive). RoCT is more&#xD;
      expensive and painful. Therefore, some patients delay or avoid getting treated, resulting in&#xD;
      later complications treated in an emergency setting. This research will aim to show that&#xD;
      pulpotomy is less painful, less involved (i.e. less invasive), less time consuming and&#xD;
      consequently more cost effective. Long term costs of dental treatment as well as the improved&#xD;
      quality of life will therefore offer benefits for patients, public and the NHS who use dental&#xD;
      services. Caries (tooth decay) is the most common diseases in the world. The NHS spends at&#xD;
      least £3.4 billion per year on dental visits or at dental hospitals. This does not include&#xD;
      private (societal) costs to individuals who do not qualify for NHS dental treatment.&#xD;
      Consequently, those who end up avoiding or delaying treatment result in complications often&#xD;
      treated through the NHS. We have therefore chosen a randomized controlled trial design, a&#xD;
      gold standard method to compare the effectiveness of the two treatment options. The&#xD;
      participants will be 168 dental patients (male or female) from different parts (London and&#xD;
      Liverpool) of the UK so that results can be generalized. This design was considered in&#xD;
      consultation with a member of the public (a co-applicant) who will be involved in the trial&#xD;
      from the start to completion. The results will be published and discussed at conferences as&#xD;
      well as through our patient and public network.&#xD;

Both assessors must agree to conclude an overall absence of apical pathology. Treatment outcome will be assessed objectively using scans taken pre-treatment and and follow-up (6,12,24 months) appointments.</description>

    <description>• The EQ-5D-3L and EQ-5D-5L measured at baseline, over the first 7 days, 6 and 12 months post randomisation. One major feature of the EQ-5D tool is that the health states obtained from the questionnaire may be con-verted into a single index value with country specific value sets. This will facilitate the calculation and comparison of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) between pulpotomy vs. primary root canal treatment. The QALY is a measure of disease burden including the quality and quantity of life lived, with one QALY equating to one year in perfect health</description>
