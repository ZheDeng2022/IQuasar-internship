      This study is a randomized, double-blind, multi-center, phase III clinical study comparing&#xD;
      the clinical efficacy and safety of HLX10 or placebo combined with chemotherapy in first-line&#xD;
      treatment of locally advanced/metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC)&#xD;
