  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep disorders represent an important public health problem that cause important personal&#xD;
      problems, absenteeism and considerable health costs. Although the main drugs used for the&#xD;
      treatment of insomnia are still Benzodiazepines and Z-drugs (Zolpidem, Zopiclone, Zaleplon),&#xD;
      these are not entirely effective and have numerous side effects that lead to poor compliance&#xD;
      with therapy . For the treatment of sleep disorders, alternative non-pharmacological&#xD;
      therapies have also been implemented, such as cognitive therapy, relaxation therapy, and the&#xD;
      introduction of new agents, including the use of melatonin as a human endogenous molecule&#xD;
      with low or zero toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Europe, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has stated that &quot;A cause and effect&#xD;
      relationship is established between the consumption of melatonin and the alleviation of&#xD;
      subjective feelings of jet lag. In order to present the declaration of health, the dose of&#xD;
      melatonin should be between 0.5 and 5 mg and should be taken close to bedtime on the first&#xD;
      day (and subsequent days) of the trip and the following days after arrival at destination.The&#xD;
      target population is the general population &quot;. On the other hand, the EFSA states that &quot;A&#xD;
      cause and effect relationship is established between the consumption of melatonin and the&#xD;
      reduction of sleep onset latency. The Panel considers that to obtain the declared effect, 1&#xD;
      mg of melatonin should be consumed near bedtime. The target population is the general&#xD;
      population.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of several studies in humans show that melatonin administered orally has a low&#xD;
      bioavailability (approximately percentage) and a very short half-life. Therefore, it has been&#xD;
      suggested that the sublingual route represents an attractive alternative for the&#xD;
      administration of compounds that have a low bioavailability, since through this route, the&#xD;
      substances are distributed throughout the body avoiding the loss of the compounds by their&#xD;
      first-pass metabolism by the liver, as well as the loss by the process of absorption by the&#xD;
      digestive system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On this basis the present hypothesis is posed: the administration of melatonin sublingually&#xD;
      will have a greater bioavailability than the administration of melatonin orally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study was to quantify the bioavailability of 1 mg of melatonin&#xD;
      when administered sublingually and orally.&#xD;
