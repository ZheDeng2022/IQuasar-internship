      This study proposes to compare current multimodal analgesic treatment for TKA with a new&#xD;
      multimodal analgesic regimen to demonstrate decreased opioid requirement, time to&#xD;
      rehabilitation, and time to reach hospital discharge.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Total knee replacement surgery (TKA) causes severe pain and this procedure is the most common&#xD;
      reason patients are prescribed strong opioid drugs in hospital. As a result they are slow to&#xD;
      begin rehabilitation after surgery, and are late in hospital discharge. Ontario hospitals are&#xD;
      constantly challenged to meet growing demands of TKA and in fact increased demand has&#xD;
      overcome the health care system resulting in TKA wait time (Ontario actual: 286 days vs.&#xD;
      target: 182 days).1 One strategy to accommodate expanding volume and reduce wait time is to&#xD;
      reduce hospital length of stay (LOS) through an enhanced recovery program.2 One essential&#xD;
      component is further improvement of postoperative pain treatment to expedite rehabilitation&#xD;
      and hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of severe post TKA pain often requires potent opioids but their excessive and&#xD;
      prolonged use has negative consequences e.g., increased perioperative adverse events and&#xD;
      longer LOS.3 Approximately 8% of opioid naive TKA patients become chronic opioid users at 6&#xD;
      months and the duration of prescription is the strongest predictor of misuse.4 Knowing that&#xD;
      the opioid crisis in Canada is steadily growing and prescription opioids play a significant&#xD;
      role in dependence and misuse,5 an effective perioperative opioid minimization analgesic&#xD;
      program is mandatory for TKA patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current multimodal analgesic treatment for TKA consists of oral non opioid drugs e.g.,&#xD;
      acetaminophen and non steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) and surgeon performed&#xD;
      peri-articular local anesthesia infiltration, however this is only partially effective.6 The&#xD;
      regional analgesic effect is often short lived (&lt; 8 hours). Failure to sustain effective&#xD;
      analgesia necessitates continued heavy reliance on opioids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several new treatments have been recently described for post TKA pain. They are: IV&#xD;
      dexamethasone (steroid),7 dexmedetomidine (alpha 2 agonist)8, ketamine (NMDA antagonist)9 and&#xD;
      2 novel nerve block procedures- adductor canal block10 and iPACK block (infiltration between&#xD;
      popliteal artery and posterior capsule of the knee).11 While each individual intervention has&#xD;
      demonstrable analgesic benefit, the impact of incorporating all new treatments into the&#xD;
      current analgesic regimen remains unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe that the new multimodal analgesic regimen proposed in this study&#xD;
      will significantly decrease opioid requirement, time to rehabilitation, and time to reach&#xD;
      hospital discharge criteria. It may also decrease the duration of opioid prescription for&#xD;
      pain relief after hospital discharge. Although investigator's preliminary experience with&#xD;
      this new regimen in 10 patients is promising, robust evidence showing its sustained opioid&#xD;
      sparing analgesic effect is lacking.&#xD;
