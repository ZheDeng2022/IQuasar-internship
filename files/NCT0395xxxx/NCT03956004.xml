  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates a technology-enabled decision aid that provides evidence-based education&#xD;
      (i.e. on understanding the condition, treatment options and comparisons, patient values and&#xD;
      question &amp; answer quiz) and personalized, quantifiable benefit-risk ratio alongside the level&#xD;
      of potential benefit in relation to joint stiffness, joint pain and quality of life. The&#xD;
      study will be performed in the setting of an integrated care system providing&#xD;
      patient-centered care for hip and knee osteoarthritis over the full cycle of care. The impact&#xD;
      of a technology-enabled decision aid incorporating predictive analytics with machine learning&#xD;
      capabilities on decision quality, activation, experience &amp; limitations of patients in this&#xD;
      setting is relatively unknown.&#xD;

    <description>Decision process subscore. Participants receive 1 point for a response of &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;a lot/some.&quot; The total points are summed and then divided by the total number of items to result in scores from 0-100%, with higher scores indicated a more shared decision making process.</description>
