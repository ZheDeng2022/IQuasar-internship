  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Good clinical care relies on precise evaluation of patients' conditions. Chronic pain and&#xD;
      other neurological and psychiatric diagnoses pose challenges because their assessment depends&#xD;
      on subjective patient-reported outcome measures (PROs). The investigators have recently&#xD;
      developed the Focused Analgesia Selection Task (FAST), a method that allows assessing pain&#xD;
      reporting accuracy. Preliminary results suggest that those who more accurately report their&#xD;
      pain show diminished placebo response. The underlying mechanisms for this observation cannot&#xD;
      be explained by current theories. Therefore, the investigators have conducted a pilot study&#xD;
      to further characterize this relation in healthy population.&#xD;

      Instruments and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instruments All stimuli were applied by a contact-heat Thermal Sen-sory Analyzer 2001 system&#xD;
      (Medoc, Ramat-Yishai, Israel) with a 30 x 30mm Peltier surface stimulator, which was attached&#xD;
      by Velcro straps to the volar surface of the forearm of the subjects' hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Familiarization session At the beginning of the experimental session, all subjects underwent&#xD;
      short training in order to familiarize them with the device and with the sensations evoked by&#xD;
      the painful stimulation, and to train them to report their perceived pain intensity using the&#xD;
      numerical pain scale. The training included exposure to three short contact-heat stimuli (44,&#xD;
      46.5, and 48°C), each lasting for 7 seconds from the time that the stimulation intensity&#xD;
      reached the destination temperature. The thermode was moved following each stimulus to a&#xD;
      completely distinct, adjacent area of skin. Subjects were asked to report the numerical pain&#xD;
      score (NPS), on a scale ranging from 0, denoting no pain, to 100, denoting the worst pain&#xD;
      imaginable, induced by each stimulus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain reporting accuracy assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject's pain reporting accuracy skills was assessed by the FAST, which is based on&#xD;
      recording a subject's pain reports in response to repeated administration of thermal noxious&#xD;
      stimuli of various intensities. During the FAST procedure the thermode was attached to the&#xD;
      ventral surface of the subject's non-dominant arm and the temperature was raised from a&#xD;
      baseline of 32°C, peaked for 3 seconds at 1 of 7 designated temperatures (44°C, 45°C, 46°C,&#xD;
      47°C, 48°C, 49°C, and 50°C), and then decreased down to the baseline. Stimulus rate of rise&#xD;
      and fall was kept constant at 8°C/seconds. Subjects were asked to rate the peak pain&#xD;
      intensity of each stimulus verbally using the NPS. Each temperature was presented 7 times in&#xD;
      a random block-ordered design (49 stimuli in total). Inter-stimulus intervals of 20 seconds&#xD;
      allowed the subject sufficient time to rate the pain they perceived during each stimulus. The&#xD;
      location of the thermode was adjusted every 10 stimuli to minimize sensitization and/or&#xD;
      habituation effects. The duration of the FAST procedure is ~25 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placebo assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The placebo effect was assessed using tonic heat delivered at fixed temperature of either 44,&#xD;
      46.5, and 48°C. As was shown by previous studies, these temperatures evokes mild, moderate&#xD;
      and severe pain sensations. During the stimuli, the thermode was attached to the volar&#xD;
      surface of the forearm of the subjects' dominant hand. Baseline temperature was 32.0 °C, with&#xD;
      an increasing temperature rate of 2°C/s and a return-to-baseline temperature rate of 8°C/s.&#xD;
      Pain intensity ratings of heat stimuli were assessed verbally using NPS, at 2, 10 and 20 sec&#xD;
      after the initiation of the stimulus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placebo procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject received clinical trial-type instructions before receiving the placebo so that&#xD;
      the condition of the study would be similar to those encountered in typical drug trials.&#xD;
      Subjects consented to participate in a study examining the analgesic effects of a well-known&#xD;
      established pain relief medication. The subjects were told that they were about to receive a&#xD;
      pain relief medication, which is commonly used in clinical practice. Possible adverse effects&#xD;
      of the substance in question were then described, but it was indicated that the investigators&#xD;
      did not typically observe significant adverse effects. Actual pharmacological agents were not&#xD;
      administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All experiments were conducted in the same setting, by the same investigator. The experiment&#xD;
      was performed in a quiet room with an ambient temperature of 23°C. After the familiarization&#xD;
      stage, the experiment begun with delivery of the FAST. After a 10 min break, subjects&#xD;
      received the three tonic heat stimuli, each lasting 20 sec long, in a pseudo-random order&#xD;
      with 60 sec break between each stimulus. Thereafter each subject was given a placebo pill. In&#xD;
      order to evaluate placebo effect, the tonic heat stimuli were administered 20 minutes after&#xD;
      placebo intake maintaining the same stimuli order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The net placebo effect (Δ) was calculated as the difference between the mean NPS of the mild,&#xD;
      moderate, and severe pain stimuli administrated before the placebo (Pre-placebo) minus the&#xD;
      same after placebo (Post-placebo). The placebo effect in percent was calculated as the ratio&#xD;
      of Post-placebo to Pre-placebo double 100. Positive values indicate efficient placebo effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of the experimental session was approximately 1 hours and 30 minutes.&#xD;
