  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this protocol is to use probabilistic reinforcement learning choice tasks&#xD;
      and magnetic resonance neuroimaging to demonstrate the impact of problematic opioid use and&#xD;
      opioid withdrawal on dynamic decision-making and reveal the neurobehavioral and&#xD;
      neurobiological processes underlying abnormal task performance. A second objective is to&#xD;
      identify an appropriate dose of intravenous remifentanil for subsequent studies in physically&#xD;
      dependent individuals with opioid use disorder.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must meet moderate/severe criteria for moderate/severe opioid use disorder, report&#xD;
             recent prescription or illicit opioid use, and be opioid dependent, as evidenced by&#xD;
             either a urine sample positive for recent opioid use or being in frank withdrawal&#xD;
             during screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects must be using an effective form of birth control (e.g., birth control&#xD;
             pills, surgical sterilization, IUD, cervical cap with a spermicide, or abstinence).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to speak and read English&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are interested in completing the remifentanil dose-ranging session must&#xD;
             report a history of intravenous opioid use and a baseline O2 saturation of 95% or&#xD;
             greater.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of, or current, clinically significant physical disease (e.g., respiratory&#xD;
             disease [asthma, COPD, sleep apnea], impaired cardiovascular functioning, seizure&#xD;
             disorder or CNS tumors) or current or past history of psychiatric disorder that would&#xD;
             limit compliance in the studies, other than substance use disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Meet diagnostic criteria for psychoactive substance use disorder for substances other&#xD;
             than opioids (OUD subjects only) or nicotine that would require detoxification (i.e.,&#xD;
             alcohol, benzodiazepines or barbiturates).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Contraindications for MRI scanning (e.g., pacemaker, metal implants, claustrophobia,&#xD;
             or any other implanted medical device).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Vision or hearing problems that would preclude completion of experimental tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At risk for respiratory complications and have predictors of difficult bag mask&#xD;
             ventilation (e.g., dentures, very full beard), in case emergency respiratory&#xD;
             intervention is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Seeking treatment for SUD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Poor venous access (only subjects who will participate in the remifentanil&#xD;
             dose-ranging session).&#xD;
