    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine cross-sectional relationships between macular&#xD;
      pigment optical density (MPOD) and visual performance in glaucoma. Additionally, the&#xD;
      investigators wish to determine the effect of lutein, zeaxanthin, and mesozeaxanthin&#xD;
      supplementation on MPOD and visual performance in glaucoma patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neurodegeneration of the optic nerve and associated ganglion cell death in glaucoma leads to&#xD;
      several well-characterized losses in visual function, most notably progressive peripheral&#xD;
      visual field loss. Several recent studies have characterized significant visual function&#xD;
      deficits in glaucoma patients that may be more sensitive indicators of disease than classical&#xD;
      visual field loss, including compromised contrast sensitivity (CS), increased disability&#xD;
      glare (DG) and protracted dark adaptation (DA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the available evidence, it appears that visual function, if assessed carefully, is a&#xD;
      reliable indicator of ocular health and/or disease state. It follows that an improvement in&#xD;
      visual function would be indicative of an improvement in ocular health. Although improvement&#xD;
      of visual function is not typically seen in ocular disease, there is recent evidence to&#xD;
      suggest that visual performance and associated progression of ocular disease may actually be&#xD;
      modifiable via nutritional strategies and dietary modification in age-related macular&#xD;
      degeneration (AMD). Because some of the compromised visual performance experienced in&#xD;
      glaucoma is associated with increased ocular inflammation, local anti-inflammatory action may&#xD;
      improve visual performance in glaucoma patients. Given their exceptional anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      activity and potential for rich deposition in the retina, the macular carotenoids lutein (L),&#xD;
      zeaxanthin (Z), and mesozeaxanthin (MZ) may hold promise for this strategy. Indeed, a recent&#xD;
      cross-sectional study of the relationship between macular carotenoid level and visual&#xD;
      performance in glaucoma patients found that those patients with low levels were significantly&#xD;
      more likely to experience problems with glare - and were also more likely to have greater&#xD;
      ganglion cell loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      L and Z are diet-derived, yellow-orange colored carotenoids obtained primarily from&#xD;
      leafy-green vegetables. L and Z are not synthesized by the body, and therefore must be&#xD;
      obtained via dietary means; those who have diets rich in leafy greens, or supplement with&#xD;
      sufficient L and Z tend to maintain and accumulate higher blood and tissue concentrations.&#xD;
      One of the conspicuous features of L and Z is their specific accumulation in the macular&#xD;
      retina, where they can reach extremely high concentrations - values as high as 1.50 log&#xD;
      optical density near the foveal center are not uncommon; it is also not uncommon to see&#xD;
      concentrations in the fovea that exceed 10,000 times that seen in the blood. Once deposited&#xD;
      in the retina, some of the L is converted to a stereoisomeric form of zeaxanthin, called&#xD;
      mesozeaxanthin (MZ). Although rare, MZ has been shown to exist in nature, and indeed in the&#xD;
      human food chain - its presence has been recently verified in salmon, trout, and sardine&#xD;
      skin, and also trout flesh. Importantly, MZ has been shown to be readily deposited in the&#xD;
      retina when taken in supplement form. The accumulation of these three carotenoids in the&#xD;
      macula yields a yellowish-orange coloration, classically known to ophthalmologists as the&#xD;
      &quot;macula lutea&quot; (&quot;yellow spot&quot;). Today, this collective pigmentation is commonly referred to&#xD;
      as macular pigment (MP), with concentrations typically expressed in terms of optical density&#xD;
      (MPOD). Xanthophyll carotenoids such as L, Z, and MZ are especially potent antioxidants. Via&#xD;
      a process called triplet excitation transfer, L, Z, and MZ can regenerate to repeatedly&#xD;
      &quot;quench&quot; the energy of singlet oxygen. This makes them capable of long-term accumulation in&#xD;
      target tissues such as the retina, where, in the absence of excessive oxidative or&#xD;
      inflammatory stress (e.g. smoking, or systemic disease such as diabetes), they are resistant&#xD;
      to turnover, and can provide continuous protection against oxidation and inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another critical function of the macular carotenoids involves their optical properties within&#xD;
      the eye. Visual discomfort in glare, disability glare, and photostress recovery time are all&#xD;
      significantly improved with higher MPOD status. CS has also been found in several&#xD;
      laboratories (for both normal and clinical populations) to be related to / enhanced by&#xD;
      augmentation of MPOD. Dark adaptation speed, absolute scotopic thresholds, and mesopic&#xD;
      contrast sensitivity have also been found to be impacted positively by MPOD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A high concentration of macular carotenoids (i.e. high MPOD) is therefore advantageous in at&#xD;
      least three ways: 1) Protection from oxidation and inflammation, 2) Filtration of potentially&#xD;
      actinic high-energy short-wavelength light, and 3) Improvement of visual performance (via&#xD;
      pre-receptoral screening of short-wave light and neurophysiological enhancement).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For baseline measures, the proposed study has the potential to determine cross-sectional&#xD;
      relationships between MPOD, visual performance, and disease severity in glaucoma. Given the&#xD;
      recent data, significant relationships are plausible - and if the investigators determine&#xD;
      these kinds of relationships, standard of care for glaucoma patients could be changed to&#xD;
      include improved patient education regarding nutrition. Additionally, visual function testing&#xD;
      (to include CS, DA, and DG testing) may be instituted for glaucoma suspects and established&#xD;
      glaucoma patients. If the investigators are able to show an acute effect of improvement in&#xD;
      visual performance, it could lead to larger trials that may yield extremely important data&#xD;
      with regard to management of glaucoma. Given the predicted exponential increase in worldwide&#xD;
      glaucoma prevalence (76 million in 2020 to 111.8 million in 2040), strategies that may&#xD;
      promote good visual function in glaucoma would be hugely significant.&#xD;
