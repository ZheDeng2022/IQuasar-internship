  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of treatment with CPX-351 (an FDA&#xD;
      approved drug for the treatment of AML) in individuals with MDS while using a new&#xD;
      stratification tool to predict outcomes of participants following HMA failure. This approach&#xD;
      is intended to gain a better understanding and insight into identifying new opportunities for&#xD;
      drug approvals in this setting.&#xD;

      This study will evaluate efficacy of treatment with CPX-351in participants with MDS while&#xD;
      using a new stratification tool to predict outcomes of patients following HMA failure in&#xD;
      order to gain a better understanding and insight into identifying new opportunities for drug&#xD;
      approvals in this setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CPX-351is an investigational (experimental) drug for the indication of myelodysplastic&#xD;
      syndrome that works by delivering two chemotherapy medications (daunorubicin and cytarabine)&#xD;
      together which are then concentrated into the bone marrow (the part of the body that makes&#xD;
      blood cells). CPX-351 is experimental because it is not approved by the Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) for the indication of myelodysplastic syndrome. This drug is approved by&#xD;
      theFDA for the indication of acute myeloid leukemia. One or more of the Investigators&#xD;
      conducting this study serve as consultants for the company that makes products used in this&#xD;
      study. These financial interests are within permissible limits established by the local&#xD;
      institutional Conflict of Interest Policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to beginning treatment, all eligible participants will be grouped into low risk versus&#xD;
      high risk based on a stratification tool used to determine their disease. Group 1 will be low&#xD;
      risk participants and group 2 will be high risk participants. All study participants will get&#xD;
      the same study drug, CPX-351. Participants will receive the CPX-351 on days 1, 3 and 5 of the&#xD;
      first 28 day cycle. After participants finish the first round of treatment and based on their&#xD;
      response they may be eligible for another 4 cycles of treatment. The participant's doctor&#xD;
      will inform them if this is an available option when the time comes. Once participant have&#xD;
      finished treatment, their doctor will continue observe for side effects and follow their&#xD;
      condition for 1 year.&#xD;
