    <textblock>
      Interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF) is a chronic interstitial lung disease&#xD;
      (ILD) with some laboratoristic and/or clinical features of autoimmune disease, but without&#xD;
      meeting criteria of connective tissue disease (CTD), and with no other causes of ILD. Despite&#xD;
      recent efforts to standardize the diagnosis of IPAF, subjects with IPAF represent a very&#xD;
      heterogenous group of patients, whose prognosis and clinical course are far from being clear.&#xD;
      It also remains to be clarified what proportion of IPAF patients develop clear features of&#xD;
      CTD over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this observational trial is to define the clinical course of patients newly&#xD;
      diagnosed with IPAF by prospectively following them for a period of 3 years, at 6-month&#xD;
      intervals. The primary outcome will be 3-year lung transplant-free survival. The secondary&#xD;
      outcome will be the proportion of patients who develop clinical and laboratoristic features&#xD;
      clearly meeting criteria for a diagnosis of CTD at 3 years from the time of diagnosis of&#xD;
      IPAF. Predictors of survival will also be studied.&#xD;

      Objective of the study The objective of this study is to investigate the clinical course of&#xD;
      IPAF to clarify the prognosis of this condition and to clarify the proportion of patients who&#xD;
      develop clear clinical features of CTD over time. Patients will be followed prospectively for&#xD;
      a period of 3 years, or until death or lung transplant (LTx). Predictors of LTx-free survival&#xD;
      will be studied as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale Interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF) is a chronic interstitial&#xD;
      lung disease (ILD) with some laboratoristic and/or clinical features of autoimmune disease,&#xD;
      but without meeting criteria of connective tissue disease (CTD), and with no other causes of&#xD;
      ILD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is not uncommon for the interstitial pneumonia to be the first, and possibly the sole,&#xD;
      manifestation of an otherwise occult CTD. The current international guidelines for the&#xD;
      diagnosis of IIP recommend excluding CTD. For this reason, many cases of ILD with autoimmune&#xD;
      features, but not fully meeting criteria for CTD, have been identified. Patients with IPAF,&#xD;
      with the current diagnostic criteria, actually represent a sizable proportion of patients&#xD;
      with ILD. However, the clinical course, prognosis and treatment approach to these patients&#xD;
      remain unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite recent efforts to standardize the diagnosis of IPAF, subjects with IPAF represent a&#xD;
      very heterogenous group of patients, whose prognosis and clinical course are far from being&#xD;
      clear. While the average age of diagnosis is higher than in CTD, there is still a female&#xD;
      predominance. An autoimmune &quot;flavor&quot; may not necessarily mean a real autoimmune etiology, but&#xD;
      currently the distinction is challenging. From this perspective, a multi-disciplinary&#xD;
      approach together with Rheumatologist is particularly important. It also remains to be&#xD;
      clarified what proportion of IPAF patients develop clear features of CTD over time. One issue&#xD;
      for example is represented by the fact patient with IPAF may be treated with&#xD;
      immunosuppressive agents, which may permanently mask the development of systemic features of&#xD;
      CTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A clear distinction between IPAF and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), one of the most&#xD;
      common types of ILD, is at the same time challenging and essential, as treatment is radically&#xD;
      different in the two conditions. CTD and IPAF patients can definitely present with the same&#xD;
      morphologic (radiographic or pathologic) pattern of usual interstitial pneumonia. However,&#xD;
      patients with IPF respond to anti-fibrotic treatment, which is expensive, while patients with&#xD;
      ILD secondary to CTD respond to immunosuppressive treatment. From a prognostic point of view,&#xD;
      the survival of IPF is considered one of the worst among all types of ILD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is tendency to treat patients with IPAF with immunosuppressive therapy, but the&#xD;
      rational for this remains unclear, given that the natural history of IPAF is not well known.&#xD;
      One retrospective study suggested that the short-term prognosis of IPAF is better than that&#xD;
      of IPF. Another retrospective study however showed that survival is worse than in CTD-ILD. At&#xD;
      the same time, the latter study showed that patients with IPAF and UIP morphologic pattern&#xD;
      had the same, poor prognosis of IPF patients, raising concern that they were actually IPF&#xD;
      patients to start with and that they were mislabelled as IPAF. Again, the retrospective&#xD;
      nature of these studies makes the results more difficult to interpret.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2015, in an effort to standardize the diagnosis of IPAF, the European Respiratory Society&#xD;
      (ERS) and the American thoracic Society (ATS) published a research statement that outlined&#xD;
      the proposed diagnostic criteria for IPAF. These include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Presence of an interstitial pneumonia (HRCT or SLB) and,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Exclusion of alternative etiologies and,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Does not meet criteria of defined CTD and,&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. At least one feature from at least two of these domains A. Clinical Domain B. Serologic&#xD;
           Domain C. Morphologic Domain&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Clinical domain:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Distal digital fissuring (i.e. &quot;mechanic hands&quot;)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Distal digital tip ulceration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inflammatory arthritis or polyarticular morning joint stiffness ≥60 min&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Palmar telangiectasia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Raynaud's phenomenon&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unexplained digital edema&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unexplained fixed rash on the digital extensor surfaces (Gottron's sign)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptoms or signs of peripheral joint synovitis considered as evidence for inflammatory&#xD;
      arthritis, but joint pain alone is not included due to its lack of specificity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other non-specific features, such as alopecia, photosensitivity, oral ulcers, weight loss,&#xD;
      sicca symptoms, myalgia or arthralgia, are not included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic profiles that may be more frequently encountered in CTD (such as younger age and&#xD;
      female, sex) are not included given their lack of specificity for CTD-ILD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Digital fissuring (&quot;mechanic hands&quot;), Gottron's sign usually suggestive of anti-synthetase&#xD;
      syndrome or systemic sclerosis-myositis overlap Raynaud's phenomenon, palmar telangiectasia,&#xD;
      distal digital tip ulceration and digital edema are usually suggestive of scleroderma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Serologic domain:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ANA ≥1:320 titre, diffuse, speckled, homogeneous patterns or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ANA nucleolar pattern (any titre) or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ANA centromere pattern (any titre)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rheumatoid factor ≥2× upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anti-CCP&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anti-dsDNA&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anti-Ro (SS-A)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anti-La (SS-B)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anti-ribonucleoprotein&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anti-Smith&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anti-topoisomerase (Scl-70)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anti-tRNA synthetase&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anti-PM-Scl&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anti-MDA-5&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Morphologic domain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Suggestive radiology patterns by HRCT :&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. NSIP&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. OP&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. NSIP with OP overlap&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. LIP&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Histopathology patterns or features by surgical lung biopsy:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. NSIP&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. OP&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. NSIP with OP overlap&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. LIP&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Interstitial lymphoid aggregates with germinal centres&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diffuse lymphoplasmacytic infiltration (with or without lymphoid follicles)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multi-compartment involvement (in addition to interstitial pneumonia):&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Unexplained pleural effusion or thickening, pericardial effusion /thickening,&#xD;
                intrinsic airways disease (by PFT, imaging or pathology) or pulmonary vasculopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The conclusion of the research statement from ERS/ATS was that &quot;prospective studies are&#xD;
      urgently needed to validate the proposed classification criteria and to determine the natural&#xD;
      history and clinical implications of a classification of IPAF&quot;, which is the purpose of this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis We hypothesize that LTx-free survival in IPAF is better than in IPF, and similar&#xD;
      to that of ILD secondary to CTD. It is also possible that different phenotypes of IPAF exist,&#xD;
      and it may be prognostically relevant to distinguish them at the time of diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We also hypothesize that a sizable proportion of IPAF patients may develop clear clinical or&#xD;
      serologic features of CTD during the observation period.&#xD;
