    <textblock>
      This phase Ib trial studies the toxicity and dosing of venetoclax in combination with&#xD;
      selinexor, and how well the combination works in treatment of patients with high risk&#xD;
      hematologic malignancies such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and acute myeloid leukemia&#xD;
      that has come back (recurrent) or does not respond to initial treatment (refractory).&#xD;
      Venetoclax functions by inhibiting a protein in the body called bcl-2, which is involved in&#xD;
      slowing down the normal process by which old cells in the body are cleared (called&#xD;
      apoptosis). Selinexor functions by trapping &quot;tumor suppressing proteins&quot; within the cell and&#xD;
      causing the cancer cells to die or stop growing. This study examines the effects, if any, of&#xD;
      selinexor and venetoclax on high risk hematologic malignancies and on the body, including any&#xD;
      side-effects.&#xD;

      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Escalation: Identify the maximum tolerated dose(s) (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose(s)&#xD;
           (RP2D) of SEL-VEN combination therapy in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma&#xD;
           (DLBCL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Expansion: Determine the overall response rate of SEL-VEN combination therapy in&#xD;
           patients with relapsed/refractory hematologic malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore biomarkers of response to SEL-VEN therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of SEL-VEN&#xD;
           combination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive venetoclax orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Patients with DLBCL&#xD;
      receive selinexor PO on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each cycle. Patients with venetoclax-naive&#xD;
      AML are treated with selinexor on days 8, 15, and 22 of cycle 1, followed by days 1, 8, 15,&#xD;
      and 22 of subsequent cycles. Venetoclax-refractory AML patients begin both drugs on cycle 1&#xD;
      day 1. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 28 days and every 3 months&#xD;
      for 2 years.&#xD;
