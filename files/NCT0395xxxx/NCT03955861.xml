      The aim of this observational study will be to recruit 100 Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) patients&#xD;
      beginning on their biologic therapy and asses, both clinically and with the use of ultrasound&#xD;
      (US), how enthesitis responds to biologic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The decision to start treatment with a biologic therapy will be made by the patients' usual&#xD;
      clinical rheumatology team, as part of their standard clinical care. This is independent of&#xD;
      the study. Patients in whom treatment with these drugs for their PsA has been recommended&#xD;
      will then be invited to participate in this study.They will then be commenced on biologic&#xD;
      therapy at doses in line with the Summary of Product characteristics (SPC) for the product&#xD;
      and followed up in the hospital outpatient clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have a full history taken and clinical exam performed prior to commencing on&#xD;
      their prescribed biologic. The patient's history, Health Assessment Questionnaire scores and&#xD;
      biobanking samples will be taken by the co-investigator. They will also calculate the&#xD;
      patients tender and swollen joint score, dactylitis score, skin score, nail score and&#xD;
      clinical enthesitis score.They will then have their tender entheseal points scanned as well&#xD;
      as those as per the MASEI (Madrid Sonographic Enthesitis Index ) protocol by a single&#xD;
      rheumatologist. The rheumatologist will be trained in ultrasound and will perform the scans&#xD;
      blinded to this information both at initial consultation and at subsequent reviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will then commence their biologic treatment as planned at a separate review as&#xD;
      per usual practise with their clinical team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up and final assessment at 4 months (±2 weeks) after starting biologic will include&#xD;
      the clinical and ultrasound assessments as per the initial review and outlined in the&#xD;
      schedule of assessments. They will also have a final blood sample taken at this point.&#xD;

      Objective: This study will aim to clarify, in a cohort of active PsA patients, what is the&#xD;
      prevalence of US confirmed enthesitis, what happens to these scores after biologic treatment,&#xD;
      does this correlate with clinical scores and can enthesitis then serve as a prognostic tool&#xD;
      in predicting response in patients receiving their biologic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims and objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -The change in MASEI score at 4 months from baseline assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;

      life data to form the basis of future randomised controlled trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration Participants will be in the study for a maximum of 6 months, with most participants&#xD;
      completing the study within 4 months after starting the biologic. The end of the trial will&#xD;
      be at the 4 month assessment for the final patient with the locking of the study database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study setting The study will be carried out on one site in Musgrave Park Hospital, Belfast.&#xD;

      Study procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial Patient Approach and consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      The decision to start treatment with subcutaneous biologic therapy will be made by the&#xD;
      patients' usual clinical rheumatology team, as part of their standard clinical care. This is&#xD;
      independent of the study. Patients in whom treatment with these drugs for their PsA has been&#xD;
      recommended will then be invited to participate in this study. The initial approach to&#xD;
      potential participants will be by their usual clinical team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written informed consent will be obtained from each subject prior to any study-related&#xD;
      procedures being performed. Consenting participants will have their baseline study assessment&#xD;
      performed whilst on the NHS biologic waiting list. They will then be commenced on biologic&#xD;
      therapy, as prescribed and followed up in the hospital outpatient clinic as usual at the 4&#xD;
      months mark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial consultation and blinding&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each group will have a full history taken and clinical exam performed as noted below. They&#xD;
      will then have their tender entheseal point scanned as well as those as per the MASEI&#xD;
      protocol. The patient's history, HAQ (Health Assessment Questionnaire) scores and biobanking&#xD;
      samples will be taken by the co-investigator. The co investigator will be a rheumatology&#xD;
      registrar and will then assess skin, joints, nails and enthesitis points and calculate the&#xD;
      scores below, all of which are routine tools used in clinical practise. A single&#xD;
      rheumatologist trained in US will perform the scans blinded to this information both at&#xD;
      initial consultation and at the 4 month review. The co-investigator and participants will not&#xD;
      be blinded to the treatment or results, although within the first consultation neither&#xD;
      patient or assessor will know what medication the consultant team will ultimately decide to&#xD;
      commence the participant on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biologic treatment will then be administered as planned by the patient's consultant&#xD;
      rheumatologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline visit (up to 2 weeks prior to starting biologic):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Demographic data and confirmation of inclusion and exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Duration of PsA and psoriasis&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Calculate BMI&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Social History: Smoking status and alcohol use&#xD;

           Patient global disease activity VAS HAQ-See attached sheet)&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Calculate their Spondyloarthritis research consortium of Canada (SPARCC) enthesitis&#xD;
           score&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Calculate their Leeds Enthesitis Score (LEI)&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Calculate Bath AS disease activity index (BASDAI)&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Calculate their (Dermatology Life Index score) DLQI score&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. Calculate their Nail Severity Psoriasis Index (NAPSI) score.&#xD;
&#xD;
       14. Calculate their Dactylitis score&#xD;
&#xD;
       15. Calculate their Physician global assessment score&#xD;
&#xD;
       16. Calculate their DAS (Disease Activity Score)-28 score&#xD;
&#xD;
       17. Blood investigations: FBC (Full Blood Count), renal profile, eGFR, inflammatory markers&#xD;
           (CRP, ESR) and liver profile will have been taken as part of routine care (Results will&#xD;
           be noted)&#xD;
&#xD;
       18. Blood samples for biobanking&#xD;
&#xD;
       19. Imaging Ultrasound Scan entheseal points as per the MASEI score These will include- Six&#xD;
           bilateral enthesis locations in each patient, including the proximal plantar fascia,&#xD;
           distal Achilles tendon, distal and proximal patellar ligament, distal quadriceps and&#xD;
           brachial triceps tendons Modalities to be documented i. Enthesophyte ii. Power Doppler&#xD;
           signal iii. Entheseal calcification iv. Erosions v. Entheseal thickness&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound scan any other entheseal points that are symptomatic, this includes if there is&#xD;
      nail changes. Choose one nail bed to US scan to assess for changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample collection for biobanking At each time point 20ml of additional blood will be&#xD;
      collected from each participant each, comprising whole blood (RNA), PBMC (DNA), serum and&#xD;
      plasma (for future immunoassays, metabolomics) .This will be placed on ice and transferred&#xD;
      securely to Queen University Belfast and spun down and the plasma will be stored at Dr&#xD;
      Rooney's Laboratory. All samples will be labelled with a unique patient study participant&#xD;
      code and this will be recorded in the database. They will be stored in a freezer at a&#xD;
      temperature of at least -20oC. The samples will be anonymised with their unique code and will&#xD;
      only be able to be identified by the principal investigator. Analysis will include a targeted&#xD;
      or unbiased protein assessment strategy in the form of a mass spectrometry based proteomics&#xD;
      platform. Analysis may also include that of genetic variation markers, related to the target&#xD;
      pathway of the biologic therapies. This may involve whole genome sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will then go onto their biologic treatment as planned at a separate appointment with&#xD;
      their clinical team where a plan will be put in place for review to assess response to drug&#xD;
      as usual at 4 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
      The decision to commence a patient on a biologic therapy will be made independent of the&#xD;
      study protocol by the patient's rheumatology consultant. All study participants will be&#xD;
      retained in the trial whenever possible to enable follow-up data collection and prevent&#xD;
      missing data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient has not been able to take their biologic therapy for a period of more than or&#xD;
      equal to 6 weeks during the study they will be deemed to not have completed the treatment and&#xD;
      will not be included in the final comparative analysis. Each of the biologic medications&#xD;
      being used in this study has a marketing authorisation in the UK and is being used in its&#xD;
      marketed presentation and packaging bearing the MA number. All medications will be sourced&#xD;
      locally by the research site pharmacy in Musgrave Park Hospital at market price as per&#xD;
      standard procedure independent of the study and stored and distributed as per usual&#xD;
      practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biologic treatment routinely used at Musgrave Park Hospital for PsA are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Etanercept&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Adalimumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Certolizumab pegol&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Golimumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Secukinumab&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up and final assessment (4 months ±2 week after starting biologic) Clinical and&#xD;
      ultrasound assessments as per the initial review will be carried out without the need to go&#xD;
      over exclusion/inclusion criteria, past medical history or family history. An additional&#xD;
      PsARC calculation based on response will be made at this point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A further bio banking sample will be taken at the 4 months mark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time plan and Study Centres:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment will take place during the first 6 months of the study and the study will end 4&#xD;
      months after the recruitment of the last patient. Once the first participant is referred by&#xD;
      their consultant they will be put on the biologic waiting list to commence their new&#xD;
      medication. This process usually takes 3 months from referral to commencing on their biologic&#xD;
      medication. We will assess the participant two weeks prior to this review and then their next&#xD;
      review will be at the 4 months mark prior to their second consultant review. The participant&#xD;
      involvement will end then.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size Sample size calculation. On reviewing the literature in relation to the MASEI&#xD;
      score, the initial paper to highlight its validity as a scanning tool in those with&#xD;
      spondyloarthropathy compared with controls was able to demonstrate this with only 25&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study 84% of patients demonstrated active disease as defined by a cut off score of 18&#xD;
      and therefore we would expect in a cohort of active PsA patients that the vast majority will&#xD;
      demonstrate active disease to allow comparison after biologic treatment. Based then on&#xD;
      available data on PsA patients prescribed biologic therapy within the Belfast trust, a sample&#xD;
      size of 100 patients was deemed achievable and would allow the primary outcome to be&#xD;
      answered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming 100 patients are recruited split 50/50 between IL (Interleukin)-17 and TNF. Then the&#xD;
      study will have 85% power to determine a difference between groups as statistically&#xD;
      significant if the difference in MASEI change scores at three months between the two groups&#xD;
      is equal to 0.6 standard devia- tions of the change score. This calculation assumes equal&#xD;
      variation in the change score in both groups, a significance level of 0.05 and is based on a&#xD;
      two-sided hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Patients will first be approached by one of the seven rheumatology consultants,&#xD;
      based in Musgrave Park Hospital.If patients are agreeable to hear more information on the&#xD;
      research they will be referred to the research team who are based in the Belfast Trust.&#xD;
      Initially an email with patient details will be sent to the research team who will telephone&#xD;
      the potential participant to discuss the study and verbally explain what the study entails.&#xD;
      If the patient is interested in participating in the study they will have an information&#xD;
      sheet posted out to their home address. The patient will then attend for their initial&#xD;
      consultation and at this point, if they are still happy to proceed with participation, they&#xD;
      will be consented for inclusion in the study. Hospital numbers and personal details will be&#xD;
      communicated by Trust computers and each patient will be given a unique identifier number&#xD;
      once enrolled. During the study the medication the patient is then prescribed by their&#xD;
      consultant team will be noted by the co-investigator and/or nurse specialist. The aim will be&#xD;
      to recruit at least 2 patients a week with the expected time line to be 12 months to complete&#xD;
      recruitment and 18 months at a maximum to complete the final patient assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management Each patient will have a unique study code participant number to make&#xD;
      information anonymised. The study will be conducted on NHS property by researchers from the&#xD;
      Belfast Health and Social Care Trust and any personal information will be held securely on&#xD;
      Trust property and handled in accordance with the provisions of the Data Protection Act 2018.&#xD;
      Blood samples will be labelled with the unique study code for each participant prior to&#xD;
      storage. These codes will be contained within a master file and will be kept under secure&#xD;
      conditions within a locked fill-in cabinet on Belfast Trust property.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Analysis of MASEI scores will be by independent samples t-tests and&#xD;
      Analysis of covariance. Differences between patient groups will be examined by calculating&#xD;
      propensity scores, obtained from running a logistic regression analysis with grouping&#xD;
      variable as outcome and patient demographic and medical history variables as explanatory. If&#xD;
      the propensity analysis is statistically significant the propensity scores will be included&#xD;
      in all subsequent analysis of MASEI. Secondary variables will be treated in a similar manner.&#xD;
      Firstly the researchers will look as to whether the MDA (5/7) or PsARC (Yes/No) score is&#xD;
      achieved at the 4 months assessment. The researchers will also compare the LEI, Dactylitis,&#xD;
      66/68 Tender and swollen score change from baseline to 4 months. Finally the research team&#xD;
      will look at the relationship between MASEI score and clinical scores at the 4 months mark to&#xD;
      see if there is correlation. The change in US findings at the nail bed will be a descriptive&#xD;
      result of any changes noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team do not envisage any urgent safety measures that will be required a part of&#xD;
      this project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CI or in exceptional cases the PI will report the urgent safety measure to the Trust&#xD;
      Research Office immediately by telephone or within 3 days in written form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent PI (Ashley Elliott) will be taking the written consent of the patient. Once they have&#xD;
      been approached to participate by their consultant the participants will receive an&#xD;
      information sheet explaining the study. Written consent will be gained at the first&#xD;
      consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Declaration of interests There is no financial or other competing interests for the principal&#xD;
      investigators for the trial.&#xD;
