    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) is currently considered a common pathology, with 15 million adults in&#xD;
      Europe and 26 million worldwide. The American Heart Association (AHA) estimates that their&#xD;
      number will increase by 25% by 2030. In France, HF affects more than one million people.&#xD;
      Because of the repeated hospitalizations of this disease, it is considered a costly pathology&#xD;
      and with a high mortality rate (23.000 deaths per year in France). Moreover, HF is a severe&#xD;
      pathology that affects the quality of life of patients and their families. Treatment and&#xD;
      medical follow-up are required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cardiac rehabilitation program is also a primary indication according to the latest&#xD;
      recommendations and repositories in Cardiology. Various studies show that &quot;Interval Training&quot;&#xD;
      exercise program improves VO2 peak compared to a &quot;continuous&quot; program, which constitutes a&#xD;
      major prognostic factor in the population of heart failure. However, it is sometimes a&#xD;
      difficult program to offer to more deconditioned patients as it requires reaching powers&#xD;
      around 80% - 95% of its maximum exertion capacity. So, a variant of the interval training is&#xD;
      offered, called Progressive Interval Training (PIT), based on the same model as the&#xD;
      conventional interval training (CIT), but with an increasing power and breathing threshold,&#xD;
      so that the patient can adapt gradually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that PIT could improve VO2 peak better than CIT in cardiac rehabilitation&#xD;
      program. Therefore, study the benefits of PIT training to improve the conditioning and&#xD;
      quality of life of patients with chronic heart failure will be studied.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Heart Failure (CHF) is due to structural or functional cardiac anomalies which causes&#xD;
      a lack of oxygen perfusion to various organs provoking symptoms as dyspnea, fatigue,&#xD;
      palpitation at rest or during efforts. International prevalence is 1-2% in adult population,&#xD;
      wich represents 15 million people in Europe and 26 millions in the world. In France, CHF&#xD;
      represents the first cause of hospitalization. The rate of intra-hospital mortality is 8.2 %&#xD;
      and the mortality in 1 year is 26 % according to the study OFICA in 2013. Its treatment is&#xD;
      first medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac rehabilitation programs are also proposed. According to the latest recommendations of&#xD;
      the European Society of Cardiology in 2016, patient education on diet, medical treatment&#xD;
      observance and facilitation of psychosocial assistance with access to a multidisciplinary&#xD;
      team, will reduce the rate of hospitalization and mortality (level of evidence IA).&#xD;
      Similarly, the regular practice of an aerobic-type activity will increase the patient's&#xD;
      functional capacity and improve the symptoms related to the disease. In the same way, the&#xD;
      risk of re-hospitalization will be reduced (level of evidence IA). Cardiac rehabilitation of&#xD;
      CHF patients includes a so-called &quot;segmentary analytics&quot; rehabilitation based on strength&#xD;
      exercises and aerobic-type endurance work. This classical program is called &quot;continuous&quot;&#xD;
      training in which the patient must exert on a cycloergometer or walking on a treadmill&#xD;
      between 60% and 70% of his maximum exertion capacity, evaluated with initial VO2 max exercise&#xD;
      test, before cardiac rehabilation. More recently, a new form of rehabilation mode appeared:&#xD;
      &quot;Interval Training&quot; (IT) inspired by high level athletes training. It is a training model&#xD;
      that alternates periods of intensity between 60%-95% of maximum effort (depending on the&#xD;
      modality) and periods of passive or active rest between 20-30% of maximum effort. IT is more&#xD;
      suitable for endurance work in CHF patients than continuous training. Indeed, this type of&#xD;
      exercise has a muscular impact, in terms of strength, superior to that brought by continuous&#xD;
      training without significantly increasing cardiac work or hemodynamic and metabolic&#xD;
      parameters. Some studies show the effectiveness of both types of programms (continuous or IT)&#xD;
      on improving the 6 minute walk test distance (6MWD) and displacing the first ventilatory&#xD;
      threshold (VT1) for higher intensities. However, the interval training has a better effect&#xD;
      than continuous program: 19.4% versus 8.3% for 6MWD improvement and 95% versus 75% for heart&#xD;
      peak rate gain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, it have been observed in daily practice that classical conventional IT (CIT)&#xD;
      program could be difficult to perform in most of CHF patients, due to the severity of their&#xD;
      pathology, poor physical condition and especially muscle deconditioning. Indeed, this&#xD;
      deconditioning is linked to the sedentary behaviour of this type of patient because of the&#xD;
      specific symptoms of his cardiac pathology, which will result in severe intolerance to&#xD;
      effort. In Cardiac rehabilitation department of Montpellier University Hospital, a new type&#xD;
      of IT program for severe CHF patients have been tested, with progressive intervals of maximum&#xD;
      effort and active rest periods, called the Progressive Interval Training (PIT) program. After&#xD;
      6 months of applying this training model to our patients, it seems to be effective in&#xD;
      endurance gain in final exercise test and without side-effects in terms of safety. The&#xD;
      objective is to compare the 2 types of IT workouts (CIT and PIT) in 2 different randomized&#xD;
      groups, on the improvement of VO2 peak in patients with severe CHF. Secondary ojectives are&#xD;
      the imporvemnt on 6MWD, life quality and ventilatory threshold at the end of rehabilitation&#xD;
      (VT1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A typical session for a patient takes place in two parts: the first one with analytical&#xD;
      segmentary rehabilitation exercises identical in terms of the muscular group worked and the&#xD;
      number of series and repetitions and adapted (charge in kg) to each patient, and a second one&#xD;
      of endurance aerobic work with conventional interval training (CIT) program or progressive&#xD;
      interval training (PIT) program according to the randomized groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CIT intervention consists in: warming 7 minutes at 15 watts, then alternating exercices&#xD;
           phases at 30% of maximum power (reached by patient at initial VO2 maximal exercise test&#xD;
           realized before cardiac rehabilation) during 3 minutes and peak at 60% of maximum watts&#xD;
           during 1 minute, then return to calm 3 minutes at 15 watts. Total duration of the&#xD;
           endurance session is 30 minutes. The power in watts of the peak work will be shaped&#xD;
           according to the Borg (if 6, increase of 5 watt the value of each peak at the next&#xD;
           session).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PIT intervention consists in: warming 7 minutes at 15 watts, then alternating exercices&#xD;
           phases at 30% watts of maximum power (reached by patient at initial VO2 maximal exercise&#xD;
           test realized before cardiac rehabilation) during 3 minutes, a first peak work at 40% of&#xD;
           maximum power, a second at 45%, a third at 50%, a fourth at 55% and a fifth at 60%, then&#xD;
           return to calm 3 minutes at 15 watts. Total duration of this endurance session is also&#xD;
           30 minutes. The peak powers will be shaped according to the Borg (if 6, increase of 5&#xD;
           watt the value of each peak to the next session).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient conducts a total of 20 sessions at a rate of 2 sessions per week. It is a&#xD;
      monocentric, controlled, randomized, prospective study with two parallel groups (open except&#xD;
      for the evaluation which will be blind). The sample size is estimated at 50 subjects.&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria are patients with CHF (left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;40%), men or&#xD;
      women over 60 years of age, admitted on a cardiac rehabilation medical, with a functional&#xD;
      capacity of less than 5 Mets, all of whom have their free and informed consent for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The benefits to the patient are those related to Cardiovascular Rehabilitation that increase&#xD;
      its functional capacity while improving its quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the effectiveness of PIT program on improving aerobic capacity (VO2 max), functional&#xD;
      abilities (VT1, TDM6 ') and/or quality of life is demonstrated, this program could be&#xD;
      recommended for cardiac rehabilitation in patients with severe CHF. A larger number of&#xD;
      patients could benefit from this program which takes into account the muscular deconditioning&#xD;
      related to their pathology.&#xD;
