  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High rates of Veteran suicide remain a tragedy. Rates of Veteran suicide have not decreased&#xD;
      for 10 years, despite the best efforts of the field. Those interventions that do exist have&#xD;
      only modest effects, which are simply insufficient for the magnitude of the problem. This&#xD;
      proposal will combine two treatments - brief cognitive behavioral therapy (BCBT) and&#xD;
      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Both of these interventions can reduce&#xD;
      suicide and are available at Veterans Affairs Medical Centers across the country, yet to date&#xD;
      no one has combined these therapies. This proposal will test the effect of this combination,&#xD;
      and, if successful, will lead to a novel yet implementable new treatment to reduce Veteran&#xD;
      suicide.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the proposed study is to test the effect of adding Transcranial Magnetic&#xD;
      Stimulation (TMS) to Brief Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (BCBT) to reduce Veterans' rates of&#xD;
      suicide ideation and related behaviors. Over 20 Veterans die each day of suicide and rates&#xD;
      have not appreciably decreased in the last ten years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BCBT is a well-established and efficacious treatment that is an extension of Cognitive&#xD;
      Behavioral Therapy, a treatment that is widely implemented across VA health care systems.&#xD;
      However, not all patients respond to BCBT. Thus finding ways to enhance treatment efficacy&#xD;
      for reducing suicide is critical. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) may be an optimal&#xD;
      treatment to use in conjunction with psychotherapy. TMS is a noninvasive technique that uses&#xD;
      a pulsed magnetic field to induce neuronal depolarization in a targeted brain region,&#xD;
      typically the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. TMS can reduce psychiatric symptoms&#xD;
      associated with suicide risk in Veterans, including depression and PTSD. Furthermore, TMS is&#xD;
      not associated with the systemic and costly side effects associated with medications used for&#xD;
      these disorders (e.g., weight gain, diabetes, sexual side effects).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to conduct a fully-powered randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      evaluating the effect of adding a standard TMS course of treatment to BCBT to reduce suicide&#xD;
      behaviors in a sample of Veterans hospitalized for suicide behavior. One hundred and thirty&#xD;
      (130) Veterans admitted to the psychiatric unit for suicide ideation or attempts will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to either active TMS plus BCBT or to sham TMS plus BCBT. Participants will&#xD;
      be assessed at baseline, post treatment, six, and 12 months post hospital discharge. Efficacy&#xD;
      of the program will be determined by examining a primary suicide composite outcome and&#xD;
      several secondary outcomes including suicide attempt, time to first attempt, number of&#xD;
      re-hospitalizations and severity and severity of suicidal ideation. Secondary analyses will&#xD;
      be conducted to help identify the types of patients who will receive the most benefit from&#xD;
      the addition of TMS to BCBT Brief Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for suicide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If successful, this study would result in a combined treatment to decrease suicide ideation&#xD;
      and related behaviors. The proposal addresses HSRD post-deployment health priority,&#xD;
      specifically suicide prevention and is innovative in that it will be the first study to&#xD;
      examine efficacy of combined treatment specifically for suicide prevention.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>130 Veterans admitted to the Providence VAMC psychiatric inpatient unit due to suicide attempt or ideation with intent to make an attempt will be recruited and randomly assigned to receive: a) active TMS+BCBT or b) sham TMS+BCBT. Both interventions will begin within the week following hospital discharge, and Veterans will be followed for 12 months post-discharge.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Prior to each TMS session, un-blinded study staff will attach the appropriate (i.e., active or sham) coil according to the participants' randomization code (obtained from the urn randomization computer program). This will facilitate &quot;triple blind&quot; stimulation, where the participant, TMS provider, and outcome rater are blind to group assignation.</masking_description>

    <measure>Change in Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Interview administered assessment of suicide ideation and behavior. The interview consists of two subscales, an ideation and behavior subscale. The severity of ideation subscale is rated on a 5-point ordinal scale: 1 = wish to be dead, 2 = nonspecific active suicidal thoughts, 3 = suicidal thoughts with methods, 4 = suicidal intent, and 5 = suicidal intent with plan. The suicidal behavior subscale is rated on a nominal scale that includes actual, aborted, and interrupted attempts; preparatory behavior; and nonsuicidal self-injurious behavior.</description>

    <time_frame>12 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>A 21-item interview administered measure. The first 5 items are screeners (wish to live, wish to die, and desire to attempt suicide), followed by 14 items to assess suicidal risk factors. The last 2 items capture previous suicide attempts.&#xD;
Each item is rated on a 3-point scale ranging from 0 to 2 according to suicidal intensity. The SSI is scored by adding up the ratings (0-2) from the first 19 items.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Suicide attempt or suicidal ideation with intent to make a suicide attempt within 48 hours&#xD;
        of hospitalization as indicated on the hospital chart and confirmed by administration of&#xD;
        the C-SSRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Primary psychotic disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bipolar disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cognitive impairment which would interfere with adequate participation in the project&#xD;
             (MMSE &lt; 20).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For safety, participants must meet established screening criteria safety during MRI,&#xD;
             which is implemented as a conservative measure given the application of TMS in this&#xD;
             population, since MRI involves magnetic fields at similar intensity to those emitted&#xD;
             from the stimulation coil. These measures require a patient not having the following&#xD;
             (unless MRI-safe):&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Cardiac pacemaker&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Implanted device (deep brain stimulation) or metal in the brain, cervical spinal&#xD;
                  cord, or upper thoracic spinal cord.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  TMS-specific exclusions are:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  pregnancy/lactation, or planning to become pregnant during the study&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Current unstable medical conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Current (or past if appropriate) significant neurological disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Lifetime history seizure disorder&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Stroke&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Cerebral aneurysm.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Other exclusions are conditions that would like to be worsened by TMS, such as&#xD;
                  bipolar disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Place Veterans at greater risk of seizures from TMS, such as severe and&#xD;
                  uncontrolled substance use disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Inability to participate in CBT&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Other conditions or circumstance that, in the opinion of the investigator team,&#xD;
                  has the potential to prevent study completion and/or to have a confounding effect&#xD;
                  on outcome assessments&#xD;
