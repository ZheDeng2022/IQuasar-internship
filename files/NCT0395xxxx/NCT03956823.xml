  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension is closely related to metabolic abnormalities such as obesity, dyslipidemia and&#xD;
      diabetes. When hypertension is complicated with metabolic abnormalities, target organ damage&#xD;
      is more serious, the risk of cardiovascular adverse events is greater, and the treatment is&#xD;
      more complex. The pathophysiological mechanism of obesity-associated hypertension has its&#xD;
      particularity. Blood pressure control and effective control of obesity are important&#xD;
      therapeutic targets. At present, there are no guidelines for the treatment of&#xD;
      obesity-associated hypertension. Although several drugs have certain effects on fat&#xD;
      metabolism, they have little effect on blood pressure and have some side effects in long-term&#xD;
      use. Among the existing antihypertensive drugs, angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT-1)&#xD;
      antagonists have shown their particularity in improving glycolipid metabolism, but strict&#xD;
      clinical trials are needed to confirm their effectiveness in weight loss and metabolism&#xD;
      improvement. Previous studies have shown that obese patients with hypertension have severe&#xD;
      insulin resistance, poor glycolipid metabolism and are prone to cardiovascular damage.&#xD;
      Telmisartan can block AT-1 receptor and partially activate PPAR-γ, increase the expression of&#xD;
      PPAR-γ target gene in preadipocytes, improve the function of visceral adipose tissue, and&#xD;
      effectively prevent obesity-related cardiovascular diseases. It is presumed that telmisartan&#xD;
      can act as a PPAR-γ agonist in clinic by altering the metabolic components and insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity, but there is no clinical evidence for this. On the basis of previous studies,&#xD;
      this study aims to evaluate the clinical efficacy of telmisartan or amlodipine in controlling&#xD;
      blood pressure, reducing fat accumulation, improving insulin sensitivity, and reducing&#xD;
      cardiac remodeling in obese patients with hypertension by prospective cohort study.&#xD;

      At present, there are no guidelines for the treatment of obese patients with hypertension.&#xD;
      Blood pressure control and effective control of obesity are important therapeutic targets for&#xD;
      obesity-associated hypertension. Whether telmisartan can be used as PPAR-γ agonist, unlike&#xD;
      other AT-1 receptor antagonists and calcium channel blockers amlodipine, can improve the&#xD;
      visceral adipose tissue function and cardiac remodeling in obese patients with hypertension&#xD;
      by altering their metabolic components and insulin sensitivity while controlling blood&#xD;
      pressure. There is no evidence that telmisartan can reduce cardiac remodeling in obese&#xD;
      patients with hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.Research contents:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the clinical efficacy of telmisartan or amlodipine in controlling blood&#xD;
           pressure, reducing fat accumulation, improving glycolipid metabolism and insulin&#xD;
           sensitivity, and reducing cardiac remodeling in obese patients with hypertension;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate whether telmisartan can alter metabolic components and insulin sensitivity,&#xD;
           improve visceral adipose tissue function and reduce cardiac remodeling in obese patients&#xD;
           with hypertension by blocking AT-1 receptor and partially activating PPAR-gamma, which&#xD;
           is different from other AT-1 receptor antagonists and calcium channel blockers&#xD;
           amlodipine.&#xD;
