  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The suprascapular nerve innervates the musculi supra- and infraspinatus, which, as part of&#xD;
      the rotator cuff, allow lifting and external rotation in the shoulder joint. Damage to this&#xD;
      nerve can lead to pain and functional deficit. Causes of injury are compression by bony /&#xD;
      ligamentous anomalies, fracture sequelae and traction damage. In the literature, a (often&#xD;
      subclinical) traction damage is increasingly claimed by a muscle retraction after rupture of&#xD;
      the supra- and / or infraspinatus tendon as a cause of pain and functional disturbances. The&#xD;
      retraction of the ruptured tendon-muscular unit is said to lead to traction damage of the&#xD;
      nerve, which can be demonstrated by pathological EMG derivations. By repositioning the tendon&#xD;
      to its outbreak site, the nerve is occasionally overstretched, so that individual authors&#xD;
      propagate a routine nerve decompression as prophylaxis. In individual cases, a previously&#xD;
      pathologic EMG result could be improved after reconstitution of an rotator cuff rupture.&#xD;
      However, prospective studies are not available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is not known how often a nerve damage is present before a rotator cuff operation and it is&#xD;
      not known how often the tendon repair leads to nerve damage or recovery of damage. It is not&#xD;
      known whether the surgical nerve decompression is associated with reduced postoperative pain&#xD;
      and what a profit or what risks bring about a routine decompression of the nerve to the&#xD;
      patient. To answer this question, this prospective randomized study is to be carried out.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      On the basis of preoperative electromyography (EMG) and electroneurography (ENG), the&#xD;
      investigators would like to determine the frequency of suprascapular neuropathy in ruptures&#xD;
      of supra- and / or infraspinatus tendons and the risk factors for their presence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a ruptured rotator cuff, the muscle is partly retracted so much that the innervating nerve&#xD;
      (suprascapular nerve) is stretched and has pathological neurological findings. The&#xD;
      Investigators now want to analyze how the arthroscopic reconstruction of the nasal&#xD;
      suprascapular nerve affects the pre-operative neuropathy. Does the pre-existing nerve recover&#xD;
      by decompression (liberation) from surrounding / entangling tissue or does decompression have&#xD;
      no influence on measurable neurology? Other patients with rotator cuff ruptures have normal&#xD;
      neurological findings preoperatively despite severe retraction of the muscular / tendon unit.&#xD;
      In these cases, the investigators are interested in whether the mobilization and&#xD;
      reconstruction of the torn muscle / tendon unit leads to a neurologically measurable&#xD;
      elongation of the nerve. This nerve stretching is a possible explanation for protracted&#xD;
      postoperative pain. With the postoperative electrophysiological measurements we can quantify&#xD;
      this nerve change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The comparison between preoperative and postoperative neurology findings allows confirmation&#xD;
      or refutation of our hypothesis.&#xD;
