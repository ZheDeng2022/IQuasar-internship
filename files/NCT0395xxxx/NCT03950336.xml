    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease (CD) is a recurring inflammation of the intestines. The etiology is unknown;&#xD;
      however evidence suggests that it could be a combination of gut microbes, environmental&#xD;
      factors and genetics. CD has a strong genetic component, with up to 12% of patients having&#xD;
      familial history. The Western diet is also thought to increase the risk of developing CD. In&#xD;
      addition up to 20% of healthy first-degree relatives (FRD) of CD patients have increased&#xD;
      small intestinal permeability (&quot;leaky gut&quot;). Previous studies have also shown that the&#xD;
      Western diet can affect the intestinal immune response and normal intestinal barrier&#xD;
      function, as well as alter the gut microbiota. We are interested in looking into whether&#xD;
      beneficial dietary fibers (prebiotics) in combination with a diet low in n-6 polyunsaturated&#xD;
      fatty acids (PUFAs) and high in n-3 PUFAs can protect against the development of CD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prebiotics are carbohydrates that cannot be digested by human enzymes and instead feed the&#xD;
      bacteria in the colon that can digest them. Prebiotics occur in different fruits and&#xD;
      vegetables. They have been shown to improve health by positively changing the gut microbes&#xD;
      and their metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prebiotic we will be using are β-fructans. β-fructans have been shown to reduce &quot;leaky&#xD;
      gut&quot; and positively impact the intestinal immune system in experimental models and healthy&#xD;
      humans. Diet has been shown to affect the gut microbes, intestinal inflammation development&#xD;
      and the activity of prebiotics. We hypothesize that β-fructans alone or in combination with a&#xD;
      diet low in n-6 PUFAs / high in n-3 PUFAs (similar to a Mediterranean diet) can reduce &quot;leaky&#xD;
      gut&quot; in FDR of CD patients, associated with beneficial changes in the gut microbes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants (FDR of CD patients; 32 total) with confirmed &quot;leaky gut&quot; will be randomized and&#xD;
      receive either a 12 g/day dose of the prebiotic oligofructose-enriched inulin (Prebiotin), or&#xD;
      placebo (maltodextrin), as well as a dietary intervention. In order to control the n-3 and&#xD;
      n-6 PUFA intake, participants will receive nutritional counselling by a registered dietitian.&#xD;
      The Mediterranean diet will have the low n-6 and high n-3 intake (&quot;Low n-6 PUFA&quot;).&#xD;
      Participants in the control diet group will be advised to follow the Canada's Food Guide&#xD;
      (CFG) recommendations. Thus, this placebo-controlled study will involve 4 intervention groups&#xD;
      with 8 participants in each group: 1) Prebiotic + Low n-6 PUFA; 2) Prebiotic + CFG; 3)&#xD;
      Placebo + Low n-6 PUFA; 4) Placebo + CFG.&#xD;

      1. Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic intestinal inflammation, affecting approximately&#xD;
           130,000 Canadians. Its incidence and prevalence is rising worldwide. The disease&#xD;
           etiology is unknown; however its pathogenesis is thought to be mediated by commensal gut&#xD;
           bacteria, affected by environmental factors in a genetically susceptible host. It is&#xD;
           well established that susceptibility to CD has a strong genetic component with up to 12%&#xD;
           of the patients having family history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Genome-wide&#xD;
           association studies (GWAS) have identified more than 230 single nucleotide polymorphisms&#xD;
           (SNPs) associated with IBD. However the risk-associated SNPs seems to account for only a&#xD;
           portion of the observed IBD heritability, as many healthy individuals and relatives of&#xD;
           Crohn's patients who carry these risk alleles never develop disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The gut microbiome, which is also implicated in the CD pathogenesis, also has a certain&#xD;
           degree of inheritance.. Up to a third of the intestinal bacteria are heritable, raising&#xD;
           the possibility of specific host genetic variants shaping the individual variability in&#xD;
           microbial profiles. A study with 582 healthy individuals found that a high genetic risk&#xD;
           for IBD was associated with a decrease in the relative abundance of the&#xD;
           butyrate-producing Roseburia. Diet independently can affect the gut microbiome in short-&#xD;
           and long term. Population-based studies in IBD indicate strong association of high&#xD;
           dietary intakes of total fats, n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and meats with&#xD;
           increased risk of IBD, while high intake of fruits and vegetables decrease that risk.&#xD;
           Animal studies have described the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of high-fat&#xD;
           diets in colitis, including decreased Paneth cell area and less production of&#xD;
           antimicrobial peptides by Paneth cells in the small intestines; reduced goblet cell&#xD;
           number and less secreted mucin by goblet cells in the small intestines; reduced levels&#xD;
           of tight junction proteins as occludin in the ileum, further illustrated by increased&#xD;
           small intestinal permeability; increased IL-6 secretion in colon; and finally expanded&#xD;
           abundance of pathobionts, such as Atopobium and Proteobacteria in stool. These data&#xD;
           suggest that a high-fat diet (as an example of Western diet) has significant effect on&#xD;
           the intestinal immunity and barrier function together with induction of dysbiosis and&#xD;
           pathobiont expansion that can finally predispose to the development of inflammatory&#xD;
           bowel disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
           N-6 PUFAs have been identified as a risk factor for IBD. Canadians currently consume&#xD;
           5-10% dietary energy from n-6 PUFA, due to increased consumption of vegetable oils&#xD;
           recommended by Canada's Food Guide. Meanwhile consumption of n-3 PUFAs (docosahexaenoic&#xD;
           acid and eicosapentaenoic acid) with anti-inflammatory actions, represent only 0.15%&#xD;
           dietary energy. Both n-6 and n-3 PUFAs are precursors of eicosanoids that regulate&#xD;
           inflammation but in polarizing means. N-6 PUFAs, promote the production of&#xD;
           pro-inflammatory series 2 prostaglandins (like prostaglandin E2, PGE2), thromboxanes and&#xD;
           series 4 leukotrienes and also exacerbated murine colitis in several models. In&#xD;
           contrast, n-3 PUFAs have anti-inflammatory properties that lead to the series 3 PGE,&#xD;
           series 5 leukotrienes, and resolvins, which reduce translocation of inflammatory&#xD;
           mediators to the site of injury. However clinical studies have shown conflicting results&#xD;
           on the use of fish oil as source of n-3 PUFAs in IBD. Previously it was shown that fish&#xD;
           oil can cause enrichment with gut pathobionts, and worsened mortality during infectious&#xD;
           colitis in mice when added to n-6 PUFA rich diet, but not if combined with other fatty&#xD;
           acids, revealing the importance of the background diet. Therefore a diet with reduced&#xD;
           n-6 PUFA but higher fibre intake is proposed to be protective in IBD.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Increased small intestinal permeability or so called &quot;leaky gut&quot; has been associated&#xD;
           with many chronic conditions as obesity, type 2 diabetes and IBD. Increased intestinal&#xD;
           permeability is also one of the potential pathogenetic risk factors for CD identified in&#xD;
           up to 20% of our 10 years' longitudinal study population of healthy first-degree&#xD;
           relatives (FDR) of Crohn disease patients. Furthermore, certain diets such as high-fat,&#xD;
           high-glucose or high-fructose diets can also cause barrier dysfunction and increase the&#xD;
           gut permeability, thus increasing the risk of developing metabolic endotoxemia and&#xD;
           chronic intestinal inflammation. In contrast, reducing small intestinal permeability&#xD;
           attenuates experimental colitis. These findings suggest that reduction of the gut&#xD;
           permeability may reduce the risk factors leading to development of CD in FDR of CD&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Studies conducted with animal models and healthy volunteers described reduction of gut&#xD;
           permeability following consumption of β-fructans. However, the prebiotics efficacy in&#xD;
           experimental IBD is also dependent on the background diet composition. We recently found&#xD;
           that β-fructans protective effect in HLA-B27 rat colitis is modulated by n-6 and n-3&#xD;
           PUFAs intake. These data highlight that β-fructan type prebiotics are beneficial, but&#xD;
           also suggest that background dietary lipid composition can modulate clinical outcomes.&#xD;
           Since most Canadians consume a high n-6 / low n-3 PUFAs diet we propose that a&#xD;
           combination of fatty acids including n-3 PUFAs will overpower n-6 PUFAs effect on&#xD;
           β-fructans and (further) improve clinical response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study Hypothesis and Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the β-fructans efficacy in reducing intestinal permeability and regulating gut&#xD;
      immunity shown in experimental models and clinical studies with healthy participants as well&#xD;
      as the effect of diet on gut microbiome, colitis development and prebiotics activity, we&#xD;
      hypothesize that β-fructans alone or in combination with high n-3 PUFAs/low n-6 PUFAs diet&#xD;
      (similar to a Mediterranean diet) can reduce increased small intestinal permeability and&#xD;
      prevent chronic intestinal inflammation in FDR of CD patients, associated with improved&#xD;
      intestinal microbiota metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to fulfill this hypothesis the following aims are proposed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess if oral administration of β-fructans and /or dietary changes can improve small&#xD;
           intestinal permeability (measured by urinary excreted lactulose and mannitol) in those&#xD;
           FDRs with abnormal permeability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess which protective mechanisms are associated with the permeability changes such&#xD;
           as alterations in circulating zonulin, glucagone-like peptide 2 (GLP-2) and plasma&#xD;
           endotoxin, as well as changes in gut microbiota composition and short chain fatty acid&#xD;
           production.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants (FDR of CD patients; 32 total) with confirmed increased small intestinal&#xD;
      permeability (defined as a ratio of lactulose/mannitol 0.025 or greater) will be randomized&#xD;
      to receive either a 12 g daily dose of β-fructans (Prebiotin, oligofructose-enriched inulin&#xD;
      in ratio 1:1, equivalent to Orafti-Synergy1, supplied by Jackson GI Medical), or placebo&#xD;
      (maltodextrin) as well as dietary intervention for 12 weeks. In order to control n-3 and n-6&#xD;
      PUFAs intake, participants will receive nutritional counselling by a registered dietitian.&#xD;
      The Mediterranean diet pattern (MDP) (also called below &quot;Low n-6 PUFA diet&quot;) with increased&#xD;
      n-3 PUFA, saturated fatty acids (SFA) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and reduced n-6&#xD;
      PUFAs food intake will be adopted as suitable low n-6 PUFA diet. Participants who will not be&#xD;
      assigned to &quot;Low n-6 PUFA diet&quot; will be advised to follow the Canada's Food Guide&#xD;
      recommendations (&quot;Control diet&quot;). Thus this placebo-controlled study will involve 4&#xD;
      intervention groups with 8 participants in each arm: 1) Prebiotin + &quot;Low n-6 PUFA Diet&quot;; 2)&#xD;
      Prebiotin + Control Diet; 3) Placebo + &quot;Low n-6 PUFA Diet&quot;; 4) Placebo + Control Diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intestinal permeability will be evaluated using lactulose/mannitol ratio (at weeks 0 and&#xD;
      12), as well as serum/plasma markers for intestinal permeability including zonulin,&#xD;
      glucagone-like peptide 2 (GLP-2) and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) (weeks 0, 6 and 12). We will&#xD;
      also study the effect of prebiotic product and diet on fecal microbiota composition and&#xD;
      activity (as fecal short-chain fatty acids and bile acids) (weeks 0, 6 and 12). Attention&#xD;
      will also be paid to the safety and tolerability of these prebiotics in FDR using&#xD;
      questionnaires related to adverse events/dyspepsia and gastrointestinal habits (weeks 0, 3,&#xD;
      6, 9 and 12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since diet is also part of the intervention study and thought to play role in the intestinal&#xD;
      permeability and prebiotic activity, all participants will receive dietary counselling and&#xD;
      will be expected to adhere to recommended diet. Long-term dietary intake correlates with the&#xD;
      bacteria taxa in the individual, so is important to quantify this prior to the dietary&#xD;
      intervention. Participants will complete the on-line version of the Canadian Diet History&#xD;
      Questionnaire II (C-DHQ II) which is a food frequency questionnaire to assess their pre-study&#xD;
      diet (habitual diet) over the past year. In order to assess compliance to the diets the&#xD;
      participants will complete the Canadian adaptation of the Automated Self-Administered 24-hour&#xD;
      (ASA24-Canada-2016) which is a validated 24 hours dietary recall. The research dietitian will&#xD;
      review recalls and provide feedback to participants based on results - in order to support&#xD;
      changes to the diets. Additionally, participants will complete the Mediterranean Dietary&#xD;
      Serving Score (MDSS). The MDSS is a validated instrument used to measure MDP adherence based&#xD;
      on the consumption of food servings and food groups. The ASA-24 and MDSS will be completed at&#xD;
      0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 weeks of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be for 12 weeks from baseline where study participants will receive prebiotics&#xD;
      treatment or placebo (maltodextrin) in addition to dietary counselling and intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral intake of oligofructose-enriched inulin in a rat model of colitis as well in ulcerative&#xD;
      colitis (UC) patients was able to increase fecal bifidobacteria and increase potentially&#xD;
      protective butyrate-producing bacteria and their butyrate production in the colon and to&#xD;
      alter cytokine production in the colon to favour a more anti-inflammatory profile. In the&#xD;
      current proposed study we will assess if such microbiota changes driven by prebiotics and&#xD;
      diet will also be associated with reduction of &quot;leaky gut&quot; in the healthy population at risk&#xD;
      for CD development. We will therefore measure small intestinal permeability at the start and&#xD;
      at the end of the study, as well as collect stool, blood/serum and urine specimen throughout&#xD;
      the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increased small intestinal permeability can also be caused by some broadly used medications&#xD;
      such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including aspirin and ibuprofen.&#xD;
      Virtually all studies agree that all conventional NSAIDs increase intestinal permeability in&#xD;
      the human within 24 h of ingestion and that this is equally evident when they are taken long&#xD;
      term. In order to control for this confounding factor, we will exclude individuals who take&#xD;
      NSAIDs on daily basis. In addition, we will request participants to stop taking NSAIDs 1 week&#xD;
      before the screening permeability test.&#xD;
