  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elective nodal irradiation has been a longstanding standard-of-care in the management of&#xD;
      mucosal squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Recent studies have suggested that&#xD;
      reduced elective dose and volume may be a viable approach to improve toxicity. In this study,&#xD;
      we are eliminating the elective neck treatment, focusing therapy on involved and suspicious&#xD;
      nodes.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We recently completed and reported a successful study (INFIELD) using reduced elective dose&#xD;
      (40 Gy) and volume (involved echelons + 1) for oropharynx and larynx cancer. In INRT-AIR&#xD;
      (Involved Nodal Radiotherapy using AI-based Radiomics), we are eliminating the elective neck&#xD;
      treatment altogether, using radiologic and radiomic-based criteria to focus treatment on the&#xD;
      nodes themselves. Eligible patients include previously untreated patients with stage I-IVB&#xD;
      oropharynx, larynx and hypopharynx cancer, excluding T1-2 glottic carcinoma. Patients&#xD;
      requiring chemotherapy may receive cisplatin, cetuximab, or carboplatin-paclitexel.&#xD;

    <description>Treatment to the gross primary and nodal disease (70 Gy), with suspicious nodes treated to 66.5 Gy, all in 35 fractions. CT and PET-CT are required for nodal assessment. Restaging PET-CT must be performed between 11-14 weeks from the completion of treatment. The patient must see an otolaryngologist after the PET-CT to decide on post-treatment neck dissection per the surgeon's judgement. Patients will then be seen every 3 months (+/- 2 weeks) for the first year, and then at least every 6 months (+/-2 weeks) until the 36 month. Subsequent and intervening follow-up visits will be made per physician preference</description>
