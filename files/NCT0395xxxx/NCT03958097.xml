  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PD-1 antibody has been approved as second line therapy for driven mutation negative non-small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer, but overall response rate is only between 15-20%. Basic study found NK cell&#xD;
      can enhance anti-tumor ability of PD-L1 antibody. This study evaluates the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of NK cell combined with PD-1 antibody for advanced driven mutation negative non-small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as second-line therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of non-small cell lung cancer is high, and most patients are in advanced stage&#xD;
      at the time of diagnosis, and the overall prognosis is poor. Currently, patients with&#xD;
      advanced non-small cell lung cancer are treated individually according to the molecular and&#xD;
      histological features of the tumor. For patients with negative driver mutation in EGFR, ALK,&#xD;
      ROS1, BRAF and other driving genes, platinum-based dual chemotherapy combined with PD-1/PD-L1&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody is recommended for first-line treatment. In patients who have not used&#xD;
      PD-1/PD-L1 antibody in first-line therapy, the second-line treatment regimen is the first&#xD;
      choice for the recommended single-agent PD1/PD-L1 antibody. However, the current efficacy of&#xD;
      PD-1/PD-L1 antibody for second-line treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer is&#xD;
      limited, only between 15-20%. NK cells secrete IFN to promote the expression of PD-L1 in&#xD;
      tumor cells and enhance the role of PD-1 inhibitors. At the same time, PD-1 antibodies can&#xD;
      bind to NK cell surface PD-1, prevent NK cell depletion, and enhance NK cell anti-tumor.&#xD;
      Therefore, the application of NK cells combined with PD-1 antibody in the treatment of&#xD;
      patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer may achieve better results.&#xD;
