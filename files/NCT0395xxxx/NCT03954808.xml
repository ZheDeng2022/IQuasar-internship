  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Motor imagery (MI) is a promising method to improve more cognitive aspects of motor&#xD;
      behaviour, and may, thus, be effective for facilitating motor planning in children with&#xD;
      Cerebral Palsy (CP). MI training facilitates the neural plasticity by enhancing the neuronal&#xD;
      cortical pathways in brain. In children with CP, motor planning and MI capacity were found to&#xD;
      be affected by studies. In the literature, there are studies about the evaluation of MI in&#xD;
      Unilateral CP but there is insufficient number of studies included in MI in the&#xD;
      rehabilitation program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of motor imagery training for gait and&#xD;
      lower extremity muscle activity (with EMG), functional capacity, quality of life, and time&#xD;
      performance variables in Children with Unilateral CP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The eligible participants will be allocated three groups, including motor imagery training&#xD;
      group, traditional physiotherapy control group, and healthy control group. All the&#xD;
      assessments will be performed before and after the training in the 8-week motor imagery&#xD;
      training group and 6 weeks after the end of training. The participants in the control group&#xD;
      will be evaluated with a 8-week interval and 6 weeks after the end of physiotherapy training.&#xD;
      The healthy participants will be assessed only once. The motor imagery training will be&#xD;
      designed for the individual basis with standard protocols. It will be applied two times a&#xD;
      week for 8 weeks. All sessions will be performed in the clinic.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Unilateral CP and age matched healthy individuals will be participate the study between the&#xD;
      ages of 7 and 18 years. Children's gross motor skills classified with GMFCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group individuals will be given a traditional physiotherapy two days per week for&#xD;
      a total of 8 weeks (traditional physiotherapy session will last 45 minutes). Motor imagery&#xD;
      training group will receive a traditional physiotherapy and motor imagery training within a&#xD;
      specific program, two days a week for a total of 8 weeks (30 minutes traditional&#xD;
      physiotherapy session+15 minutes MI training) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the scope of MI training, individual training program will be determined by taking&#xD;
      into consideration the needs of the individuals and the expectations for gait. The basic case&#xD;
      of PETTLEP (Physical, Environment, Task, Timing, Learning, Emotion, Perspective) will be&#xD;
      followed. MI training will be given individually with the same physiotherapist.&#xD;

    <measure>Mental Chronometry for Timed Up and Go Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at 8 weeks and 14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Motor imagery capacity will be evaluated by mental chronometry. This paradigm compares the duration between the actual movement and the imagined movement similar task duration. In this paradigm, participants are asked to do the Timed Up and Go test (TUG) and then they are asked to imaging the TUG. The timing of the imaging and actual movement will be determined by the stopwatch. Then compare the duration of actual and imagined movements. The temporal accuracy between actual and imagined movement will be calculated in terms of the delta time.</description>

    <measure>Modified Tardieu Scale (MTS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at 8 weeks and 14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Assessing muscle tone of individuals. It evaluates reaction of the muscle to passive movement of limb both slow and fast speeds. This scale evaluated the speed-dependent nature of spasticity. Quality of muscle reaction (X) and the angle of muscle reaction (Y) are determined by the modified tardieu scale. If quality of muscle reaction score was 2 or higher, the joint angle in which the muscle responds with difficulty will be measured goniometer. The Modified Tardieu Scale scores range from 0 to 5. Scoring: 0= no resistance to passive movement. 1= slight resistance throughout the course of the passive movement. 2= there's a clear catching at a precise angle, which makes passive movement difficult, followed by a release. 3= fatigable clonus (Less than 10 seconds). 4= infatigable clonus (More than 10 seconds). 5= the joint cannot be moved.</description>

The questionnaire consisted of 27 items and three sub-dimensions (Oppositionality, Hyperactivity, Cognitive Problems-Inattention). Response formats are in the form of a four-point Likert type scale. Answer options and scoring are as follows: 0 points are never correct, 3 points are very accurate, with total scores ranging from 0 to 81. Cognitive Problems-Inattention subscale has the minimum score is 0 and the maximum score is 18. Higher scores are reflective of worse situations of attention.</description>
