  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well lenvatinib and everolimus work in treating patients with&#xD;
      carcinoid tumors that have spread to other places in the body (advanced) and cannot be&#xD;
      removed by surgery (unresectable). Lenvatinib and everolimus may stop the growth of tumor&#xD;
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (per version 1.1)&#xD;
      objective response rate of lenvatinib in combination with everolimus among patients with&#xD;
      advanced carcinoid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the progression free survival duration of lenvatinib in combination with&#xD;
      everolimus among patients with advanced carcinoids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of lenvatinib in combination with everolimus&#xD;
      among patients with advanced carcinoid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine clinic benefit rate at 6 months (defined as complete response plus partial&#xD;
      response plus stable disease) with lenvatinib + everolimus among patients with advanced&#xD;
      carcinoid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine early CgA and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) response rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive lenvatinib orally (PO) daily and everolimus PO daily on days 1-28.&#xD;
      Treatments repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.&#xD;

             albumin) must be within clinically relevant limits (e.g., a patient can be enrolled if&#xD;
             a lab value may be outside the normal laboratory range but the abnormality is not&#xD;
             clinically relevant or can be repeated.).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Spirometry and diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) 50% or&#xD;

             excluded by vaginal ultrasound or lack of expected doubling of beta-HCG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

             and/or surgery has been completed and serial evaluation by computed tomography (CT)&#xD;
             (with contrast enhancement) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) over a minimum of 3&#xD;
             months demonstrates the disease to be stable and if the patient remains asymptomatic,&#xD;
             then the patient may be enrolled. Such patients must have no need for treatment with&#xD;
             steroids or anti-epileptic medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with concurrent malignancies or malignancies within 3 years prior to starting&#xD;

             gastrointestinal (GI) function or GI disease that may significantly alter the&#xD;
             absorption of the study drugs (e.g., ulcerative diseases, uncontrolled nausea,&#xD;

             palliation within =&lt; 2 weeks prior to starting study drug, and who has not recovered&#xD;
             to grade 1 or better from related side effects of such therapy (exceptions include&#xD;
             alopecia) and/or in whom &gt;= 30% of the bone marrow was irradiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has had major surgery within 21 days prior to starting study drug or has not&#xD;
             recovered from major side effects (tumor biopsy is not considered as major surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Impaired cardiac function or clinically significant cardiac diseases, including any of&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patient has a history of non-compliance to medical regimen or inability to grant&#xD;
             consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a female after&#xD;
             conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a positive hCG&#xD;
             laboratory test (&gt; 5 mIU/mL).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of&#xD;
             becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception&#xD;
             throughout the study and for 8 weeks after study drug discontinuation. Highly&#xD;
             effective contraception methods include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of&#xD;
                  the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without in&#xD;
                  case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has&#xD;
                  been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female patients on&#xD;
                  the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that&#xD;
                  patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Combination of any of the two following&#xD;

                       contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  In case of use of oral contraception, women should have been stable on the same&#xD;
                  pill before taking study treatment. Note: Oral contraceptives are allowed but&#xD;
                  should be used in conjunction with a barrier method of contraception due to&#xD;
                  unknown effect of drug-drug interaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have&#xD;
             had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile&#xD;
             (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral&#xD;
             oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago.&#xD;
             In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has&#xD;
             been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child&#xD;
             bearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sexually active males unless they use a condom during intercourse while taking the&#xD;
             drug and for 28 days after stopping treatment and should not father a child in this&#xD;
             period. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent&#xD;
             delivery of the drug via seminal fluid.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects having &gt; 1 + proteinuria on urine dipstick testing will undergo 24 hour (h)&#xD;
             urine collection for quantitative assessment of proteinuria. Subjects with urine&#xD;
             protein &gt;= 1 g/24 h will be ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active hemoptysis (bright red blood of at least 0.5 teaspoon) within 3 weeks prior to&#xD;
             the first dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior therapy with mTOR inhibitors (e.g. sirolimus, temsirolimus, deforolimus) and/or&#xD;
             lenvatinib. Prior antiangiogenic therapies (including but not limited to bevacizumab,&#xD;
             aflibercept, sunitinib and/or pazopanib) are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other active malignancy (except definitively treated melanoma in-situ, basal or&#xD;
             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or carcinoma in-situ of the cervix or bladder)&#xD;
             within past 24 months.&#xD;
