  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, prospective, open-label, single-arm, observational, feasibility&#xD;
      study. The goal of this study is to determine the feasibility of intra-spinal stimulation&#xD;
      with optimal paresthesia coverage therapy for chronic pain relief in patients with complex&#xD;
      regional pain syndrome type I or causalgia. Up to 20 patients with intractable chronic severe&#xD;
      limb pain associated with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) will be included in the&#xD;
      study. A standard of care trial phase to test a subjects' response to Intraspinal-Optimal&#xD;
      Stim therapy will be conducted during a 3 to 10-day period. Patients that obtain 50% or&#xD;
      greater pain relief during the trial period will undergo permanent implantation of the&#xD;
      device. Primary outcome will evaluate pain response at 3 months of therapy, based on NPRS&#xD;
      pain score relative to baseline. Patients will be followed up for 6 months after the start of&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;

    <description>Change in pain relative to baseline pain (i.e. prior to therapy) at 3 months after device activation for providing Intraspinal-Optimal Stim therapy. Pain scoring will be based on the 11-points (0 to 10) numerical pain rating scale. In this scale a value of 0 means no pain, and a value of 10 reflects the worst imaginable pain.</description>

    <description>During the trial, percutaneous lead(s) will be implanted, following standard clinical practices, in the posterior epidural space with the final lead position located in the optimal area to provide pain relief by stimulating neural tissue in order to create paresthesia(s) only on the painful dermatome(s). During Intraspinal-Optimal Stim, a set of electrodes in the stimulation lead(s) will deliver a charge-balanced, pulsed electrical signal with stimulation parameters (frequency, pulse width, and amplitude) within the FDA approved specifications of the commercially available external neurostimulator. These will be adjusted to produce paresthesia coverage of the painful area. Patients that will report equal or greater than 50% reduction in pain, relative to baseline pain, may undergo permanent implantation of a commercially available neurostimulator (INS). This will require a surgical intervention to implant stimulation leads, INS and anchoring hardware followed by therapy programming.</description>
