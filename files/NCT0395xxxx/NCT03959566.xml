    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label, randomized, controlled, multi-center Phase IIB dose-finding&#xD;
      trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and&#xD;
      exposure-response-relationship of different doses of sutezolid (STZ) in combination with&#xD;
      bedaquiline, delamanid and moxifloxacin in adults with newly diagnosed, uncomplicated, smear&#xD;
      positive and drug sensitive pulmonary tuberculosis. Participants will be randomized to one of&#xD;
      five arms containing bedaquiline, delamanid and moxifloxacin with different doses of STZ&#xD;
      (0mg, 600mg once daily (OD), 1200mg OD, 600 mg twice daily (BD), 800 mg BD). Study treatment&#xD;
      duration will be three months, followed by a follow-up period of 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to identify the optimal dose of sutezolid to be used in subsequent&#xD;
      studies that provides the best efficacy at acceptable safety of the drug by describing the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability and exposure toxicity relationship of sutezolid (and its main&#xD;
      metabolite) given over three months, in combination with standard-dose bedaquiline, delamanid&#xD;
      and moxifloxacin, compared to standard-dose bedaquiline, delamanid and moxifloxacin alone.&#xD;

      This open-label Phase IIB dose-finding, randomized, controlled study with a duration of three&#xD;
      months of experimental therapy in adult patients with newly diagnosed, smear positive,&#xD;
      uncomplicated, drug sensitive pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) will be carried out to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety, efficacy, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and exposure/response-relationship of&#xD;
      different doses of sutezolid in combination with bedaquiline, delamanid and moxifloxacin&#xD;
      (BDM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to one of five arms containing bedaquiline, delamanid and&#xD;
      moxifloxacin with different doses of STZ (0mg, 600mg OD, 1200mg OD, 600 mg BD, 800 mg BD).&#xD;
      Study treatment duration will be three month, followed by a follow-up period of 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 75 male or female subjects, aged between 18 and 65 years with newly diagnosed,&#xD;
      drug sensitive, uncomplicated, smear-positive, pulmonary TB will be included and randomized&#xD;
      to one of five arms containing BDM with different doses of STZ:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 1 (U0): Bedaquiline, delamanid, moxifloxacin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 2 (U600): Bedaquiline, delamanid, moxifloxacin, sutezolid 600 mg OD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 3 (U1200): Bedaquiline, delamanid, moxifloxacin, sutezolid 1200 mg OD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 4 (U600BD): Bedaquiline, delamanid, moxifloxacin, sutezolid 600 mg BD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 5 (U800BD): Bedaquiline, delamanid, moxifloxacin, sutezolid 800 mg BD&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sub-study will assess CYP P450 3A4 enzyme induction potential using the probe drug&#xD;
      midazolam, given to participants in arm 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using PK data and data from primary efficacy and safety objectives, we will develop an&#xD;
      exposure-response and a population PK-model for sutezolid and its main metabolite to support&#xD;
      the main objective, selection of a dose for subsequent studies.&#xD;
