      The study will consist of randomized controlled clinical study trial comparing the results of&#xD;
      a demineralized putty allorgraft versus a combined mineralized/demineralized putty allograft&#xD;
      in approximately 30 patients, 15 per group. All materials used in the study are FDA approved.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thirty patients will be treated using the principles of guided bone regeneration utilizing a&#xD;
      full thickness flap for ridge preservation. Fifteen test patients will receive an intrasocket&#xD;
      demineralized and mineralized combination putty allograft (MinerOss Putty, BioHorizons)&#xD;
      covered with a regenerative tissue matrix membrane (AlloDerm GBR, BioHorizons). The positive&#xD;
      control group of fifteen patients will receive an intrasocket demineralized putty allograft&#xD;
      (Puros, Zimmer) covered with a regenerative tissue matrix membrane (AlloDerm GBR,&#xD;
      BioHorizons). Approximately, four months post-surgery, a trephine core will be taken from the&#xD;
      grafted site immediately prior to implant placement and submitted for histologic processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to surgery, each patient will receive a diagnostic work-up including standardized&#xD;
      radiographs (periapicals), study casts, clinical photographs, and a clinical examination to&#xD;
      record attachment level, probing depth, recession, and mobility of teeth adjacent to the&#xD;
      extracted sites. Customized acrylic occlusal stents will be fabricated on the study casts to&#xD;
      serve as fixed reference guides for the measurements. Detailed oral hygiene instructions will&#xD;
      be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For histology, trephine core specimens will be evaluated to determine percent vital bone,&#xD;
      non-vital bone, and trabecular space. Step serial sections will be taken from each&#xD;
      longitudinally sectioned core. The sections will be stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Ten&#xD;
      slides per patients will be prepared with at least 4 sections per slide. For each patient, 6&#xD;
      of 10 slides will be assessed. The mean percentage of vital and nonvital bone, and trabecular&#xD;
      space will be determined for each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Soft tissue thickness will be measured prior to the procedure. The surgical procedure will&#xD;
      consist of a full-thickness papilla preservation flaps performed on the buccal and&#xD;
      palatal/lingual to expose the alveolar ridge and the tooth to be extracted. Following the&#xD;
      extraction, vertical measurements will be taken with the acrylic occlusal stent in place, and&#xD;
      horizontal measurements with a specially designed digital caliper. Both groups will receive&#xD;
      an intrasocket graft covered by a regenerative tissue matrix membrane. The control group will&#xD;
      receive a demineralized putty allograft. The test group will receive a combination&#xD;
      mineralized and demineralized putty allograft. The surgical procedures will be documented&#xD;
      with clinical photographs of teeth and/or intraoral structures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post surgical management includes all patients will be seen every 2 weeks until 8 weeks&#xD;
      post-surgery. Patients will then be seen monthly until month 4 for the final examination and&#xD;
      trephine core collection for histological analysis and implant placement. Patients will take&#xD;
      doxycycline 100 mg qd for two weeks, Hydrocodone/Acetaminophen 5/325mg q4-6h as needed for&#xD;
      pain, and naproxen 375mg q12h for one week for inflammation reduction. Postoperative visits&#xD;
      will consist of supragingival plaque removal, and oral hygiene reinforcement Any patient who&#xD;
      develops any significant post-operative complications or adverse reaction to the materials&#xD;
      used or shows attachment loss greater or equal to 2 mm on teeth adjacent to the experimental&#xD;
      site will be exited from the study and will receive appropriate treatment.&#xD;
