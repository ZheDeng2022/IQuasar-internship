  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In France, for general practitioners, the Emergency Hospitality Services (UAS) are the&#xD;
      fastest and usual way to respond to the complexity of managing elderly polypathological&#xD;
      patients. In 2013, the Regional Health Agencies proposed the creation of direct telephone&#xD;
      assistance managed by geriatric doctors (geriatric hotlines) to promote interactions city -&#xD;
      hospital. The aim of these hotlines is to improve the care pathways and health status of&#xD;
      seniors. The objective of this study is to describe the care trajectories and health status&#xD;
      of subjects over 75 years of age hospitalized in a short-term geriatric stay on the guidance&#xD;
      of a Geriatric Hotline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will take place over 24 months and in 7 French University Hospitallers Centres. The&#xD;
      study will include all patients aged 75 and over, living at home or in an institution, who&#xD;
      are hospitalized in a short-term geriatric ward on the guidance of a Hotline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results will show whether a management by the geriatric hotline is the most suitable for&#xD;
      seniors, with an average length of stay probably shorter.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter descriptive study conducted in seven French investigating centers&#xD;
      (including university centers) with sub-group analysis. Participating establishments will all&#xD;
      be voluntary. In order to participate to the study, an establishment must have a specific&#xD;
      telephone line for doctor-doctor communications. Only calls originating from healthcare&#xD;
      professionals are to be taken into account.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will last for 24 months. Study population and eligibility The study population will&#xD;
      be constituted of people aged 75 and over, living in their own home or in a care facility&#xD;
      (including independent-living facilities), hospitalized in short-stay geriatric care referred&#xD;
      by the hotline in one of the investigating centers, and who are fully aware of the study and&#xD;
      their rights regarding their participation. The first questionnaire will be filled out via&#xD;
      the hotline by the geriatric specialist answering the call. A second questionnaire will then&#xD;
      be filled out during the patient's hospitalization by the treating geriatric specialist&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All people aged 75 years and over hospitalized in short-stay geriatric care via a hotline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion procedure: (the location, inclusion and non-inclusion criteria verification by&#xD;
      investigators, explanation of the study, and delivery of information form will all be the&#xD;
      responsibility of each center independently, conducted when the patient is admitted to&#xD;
      short-stay geriatric care).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study involves no extra examinations or treatment besides traditional practices, the&#xD;
      only difference being the digitization of all medical findings for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This corresponds to when the patient is discharged from short-stay geriatric care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participation duration for each patient: short-stay geriatric care duration.&#xD;
&#xD;

      Procedure for early discontinuation of the study or exclusion from the study All subjects&#xD;
      can, at any moment and by any method, decide to withdraw from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation criteria The primary endpoint is the mean duration of hospitalization in&#xD;
      short-stay geriatric care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoints selected are hospital mortality rate, assessment of health status of&#xD;
      elderly patients hospitalized in short-stay geriatric wards using different criteria, and&#xD;
      their outcomes following discharge; describing and comparing how the different hotlines&#xD;
      across France function; analyzing the principal responses provided to doctors using the&#xD;
      hotline and improving awareness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be noninterventional. All interventions will be carried out following normal&#xD;
      clinical practices. There will be no unusual risk or specific constraint for participating&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RECORDED VARIABLES AND SOURCE DATA The study data will be collected directly from the&#xD;
      questionnaires as the study progresses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the first questionnaire, filled out by the hotline geriatric specialist, the following&#xD;
      information will be collected for the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health data: the identification of both speakers on the call; patient age; reasons for&#xD;
      calling; degree of emergency as perceived by the geriatric specialist and the calling doctor,&#xD;
      evaluated by simple verbal scale from 0 to 10; responses offered by geriatric specialist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administrative data: call duration in minutes. This questionnaire will be anonymous with no&#xD;
      identifying criteria. It will be filled out every time contact is made via the hotline,&#xD;
      irrespective of what responses are offered by the doctor (referrals to short-stay geriatric&#xD;
      care or not).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the second questionnaire, filled out by the geriatric specialist treating the patient&#xD;
      during their hospitalization in short-stay geriatric care, following referral from the&#xD;
      hotline, the following information will be collected for the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Socio-demographic data: First and last name of the patient, Patient Permanent Identification&#xD;
      (PPI) number, patient age. This data will be anonymized on entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health data: Reasons for hospitalization, number of hospitalizations during the year,&#xD;
      polypharmacy (&gt;4), biological data : albumin and C-reactive protein levels for assessing&#xD;
      nutritional status, Charlson's index calculation using patient history for assessing the&#xD;
      comorbidities of our geriatric population), evaluation of activities of daily living (ADL)&#xD;
      prior to hospitalization according to the validated ADL (/6) and instrumental ADL (IADL)&#xD;
      scales (/4), evaluation of cognitive status using MMSE score (/30), recommended referral&#xD;
      after hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Family/Marital status data: single or with a partner, with or without children Living&#xD;
      situation data: Residence of patient (own home, independent-living facility, nursing home)&#xD;
      Type of living area data: urban, semi-urban or rural&#xD;
&#xD;
      Signaling data and findings relating to family or marital status will help characterize the&#xD;
      patients who participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data relating to living location, type and area are recorded in order to assess the impact of&#xD;
      these factors on use of the hotline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, data relating to health status is recorded as justified by the bibliographical&#xD;
      references to which it is sent.&#xD;

    <description>By questionnaire : Charlson's index calculation using patient history for assessing the comorbidities of our geriatric population.&#xD;
The Charlson comorbidity index : a method of predicting mortality by classifying or weighting comorbid conditions.&#xD;
The Charlson comorbidity index predicts the one-year mortality for a patient who may have a range of comorbid conditions, such as heart disease, AIDS, or cancer (a total of 22 conditions). Each condition is assigned a score of 1, 2, 3, or 6, depending on the risk of dying associated with each one. Scores are summed to provide a total score to predict mortality The minimum score is 0 and the maximum score is 27. The value 0 is the best possible result. With a charlson score of 3 or higher, there is a risk of an adverse change in the patient's state of health.&#xD;
Score = 0 =&gt; 12% of 1 year mortality Score of 1 to 2 =&gt; 26% of 1 year mortality Score of 3 to 4 =&gt; 52% of 1 year mortality Score of 5 or more =&gt; 85% of 1 year mortality</description>
