  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In many cases the bone of the edentulous posterior mandibular regions is atrophied such that&#xD;
      sufficiently long fixtures cannot be placed without encroaching on the inferior alveolar&#xD;
      nerve so rehabilitation of these regions with severe ridge atrophy represents anatomical,&#xD;
      surgical, and biological difficulties, and provides a challenge to the dental surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several surgical techniques have been employed in an attempt to allow implant placement in&#xD;
      these regions. one of these techniques is inferior alveolar nerve transposition or&#xD;
      lateralization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lateralization of the inferior alveolar nerve has the advantages of that it allow&#xD;
      placement of longer implants which gives better stability,but this technique has the&#xD;
      disadvantage of high risk of temporary or permanent inferior alveolar nerve dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In most of the cases of inferior alveolar nerve lateralization it is directly repositioned on&#xD;
      the implant surface or a bone graft is placed in between them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a previous study on dogs found that presence of a resorbable membrane between the inferior&#xD;
      alveolar nerve and the implant surface lead to the formation of a soft tissue zone between&#xD;
      them while in the group where no membrane was used there was intimate contact between&#xD;
      them.This intimate contact may lead to the dysfunction symptoms,also the intimate contact&#xD;
      between the implant threads and the nerve act as a source of chronic irritation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platelet rich fibrin membrane is a platelet concentrate which allow slow and sustained&#xD;
      release of high quantities of growth factors over long period of time thus improves healing&#xD;
      of hard and soft tissue and optimizing wound healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      in this study we will assess the effect of platelet rich fibrin membrane on the improvement&#xD;
      of the neurosensory disturbances which occur after inferior alveolar nerve lateralization&#xD;
      which considered as the main disadvantage of this technique.&#xD;

      Background and rational:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In many cases the bone of the edentulous posterior mandibular regions is atrophied such that&#xD;
      sufficiently long fixtures cannot be placed without encroaching on the inferior alveolar&#xD;
      nerve so rehabilitation of these regions with severe ridge atrophy represents anatomical,&#xD;
      surgical, and biological difficulties, and provides a challenge to the dental team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several surgical techniques have been employed in an attempt to allow implant placement in&#xD;
      these regions. These include bone grafting, distraction osteogenesis, inferior alveolar nerve&#xD;
      transposition or lateralization (IANL), and placement of fixtures in a lingual position to&#xD;
      the neurovascular bundle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lateralization of the inferior alveolar nerve(IAN) has the advantages of that it allow&#xD;
      placement of longer implants, gives better initial stability due to bicortical anchorage, and&#xD;
      reduces the treatment time. Also it increases the resistance to the occlusal forces and&#xD;
      improves the proportion between the implant and prosthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This technique has the disadvantage of it is a complex procedure, with a high risk of&#xD;
      complications which include temporary or permanent inferior alveolar nerve dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In most of the cases of inferior alveolar nerve lateralization it is directly repositioned on&#xD;
      the implant surface or a bone graft is placed in between them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a previous study on dogs it was found that presence of a resorbable membrane between the&#xD;
      inferior alveolar nerve and the implant surface lead to the formation of a soft tissue zone&#xD;
      between them (average distance was 348.3µm) while in the group where no membrane was used&#xD;
      there was intimate contact between them (average distance was 39.8µm).This intimate contact&#xD;
      may lead to the dysfunction symptoms or at least it does not prevent thermal conduction via&#xD;
      implant surface,also the intimate contact between the implant threads and the nerve act as a&#xD;
      source of chronic irritation which could induce longstanding edema and formation of&#xD;
      intraneural fibrotic scar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platelet rich fibrin membrane is a second generation of platelet. It consist of high&#xD;
      concentrate of collected platelets which allow slow and sustained release of high quantities&#xD;
      of growth factors such as (Transforming Growth Factor b-1 (TGFbeta-1), platelet derived&#xD;
      growth factor; vascular endothelial growth factor( VEGF) and an important coagulation&#xD;
      matricellular glycoprotein wish is thrombospondin-1(TSP-1) over long period of time thus&#xD;
      improves healing of hard and soft tissue and optimizing wound healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition it has advantage over other resorbable membranes because they are entirely&#xD;
      autologous, simple in preparation method and low in cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a previous study on rats the effect of platelet rich fibrin on sciatic nerve injury was&#xD;
      studied, excision of 10 mm of the sciatic nerve was done then the nerve was bridged with a&#xD;
      silicon tube filled with fragments of platelet rich fibrin. The walking track test showed&#xD;
      significant improvement of functional recovery in the platelet rich fibrin group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current literature there were no Randomized Clinical Trials (RCTs) that have evaluated&#xD;
      the effect of platelet rich fibrin membrane on the neurosensory function of the inferior&#xD;
      alveolar nerve after its lateralization and prevention of nerve dysfunction, so in this study&#xD;
      we will assess the effect of platelet rich fibrin membrane on the improvement of the&#xD;
      neurosensory disturbances which occur after inferior alveolar nerve lateralization and&#xD;
      considered the main disadvantage of this technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of the effect of platelet rich fibrin membrane on improvement of neurosensory&#xD;
      disturbance of the inferior alveolar nerve after its lateralization. This assessment will be&#xD;
      performed through:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) Subjective assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using visual analogue scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      b) Clinical assessment: using three tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Static light touch detection test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Brush stroke discrimination test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Tactile discrimination test.&#xD;
&#xD;
           c) electrophysiological assessment: electro somatosensory evoked potential test of the&#xD;
           inferior alveolar nerve.&#xD;
&#xD;

                defect) will undergo radiographic examination using cone beam computed tomography.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The side of the mandible (right or left) which has insufficient bone height above&#xD;
                the inferior alveolar canal less than 8mm will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participants will be given a brief explanation about the surgery and they were&#xD;
                informed about possible alterations in lip sensation; any questions were fully&#xD;
                answered and the patients will sign informed consents prior to the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Eligible sides will be randomized in equal proportions between two groups; Group I&#xD;
                (study group) platelet rich fibrin group and Group II (control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
