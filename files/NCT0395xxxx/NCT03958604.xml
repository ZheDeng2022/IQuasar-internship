      The purpose of this prospective post market pilot study is to evaluate the effect of Burst&#xD;
      Spinal Cord Stimulation(B-SCS) in the management of chronic discogenic pain in subjects who&#xD;
      are refractory to other available treatments. Selected subjects will not be suitable&#xD;
      candidates for lumbar spinal surgery and will meet the standard selection process for SCS as&#xD;
      routinely utilized in the study centers. Results from this pilot study will inform current&#xD;
      clinical practice and future comparative studies in this specific population. Eligible&#xD;
      subjects for B-SCS will be asked to participate in this study. If they decide to participate,&#xD;
      they will be treated with the Prodigy TM and Proclaim TM (Abbott Laboratories) SCS system and&#xD;
      prospectively followed for 12 months following implantation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-arm, single-center, post-market, pilot study to collect data on&#xD;
      back pain relief, subject satisfaction, quality of life, physical functioning and safety.&#xD;
      Chronic discogenic pain(CDP) suffering patients will be followed for 12 months with follow-up&#xD;
      visits at 3, 6, and 12 months. In line with standard practice the system will be implanted in&#xD;
      two stages. The first stage is the Trial Burst spinal cord Neurostimulation (TBNS) phase&#xD;
      during which epidural leads are implanted and temporarily tunnelled to an external trial&#xD;
      stimulation device. Subjects will then utilize the temporary system for a period in line with&#xD;
      usual practice (typically 10-14 days). If, at the end of this TBNS phase a reduction of ≥50%&#xD;
      is achieved the device will be permanently implanted (the second stage) and subjects will be&#xD;
      followed-up during 12 months. Patients who do not have at least 50% pain relief during TBNS&#xD;
      will receive a Trial Tonic Neurostimulator(TTNS) targeting the dorsal root ganglion(DRG).&#xD;
      Similarly, these patients will be followed-up during 12 months.&#xD;
