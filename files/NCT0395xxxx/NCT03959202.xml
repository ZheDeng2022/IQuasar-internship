  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive decline and sleep complaints are prevalent in older adults and severely affect&#xD;
      older adults' physical health and quality of life. Sedentary lifestyle, which is reported by&#xD;
      90% of older Americans, is an important risk factor for both cognitive decline and sleep&#xD;
      disturbances. Although promoting physical activity has benefits to older adults' health,&#xD;
      including sleep and cognition, traditional interventions to increase activity are challenging&#xD;
      due to extensive staffing requirements and low adherence. Electronic activity monitors, such&#xD;
      as wrist-worn accelerometers, can track heart rate, activity, and sleep to allow individuals&#xD;
      to work towards personal activity and sleep goals. These appealing features make these&#xD;
      devices ideal for interventions that aim to change behaviors and improve health outcomes.&#xD;
      However, the efficacy of using electronic activity monitors to promote physical activity and&#xD;
      health in older adults has not been examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial in a cohort of older adults&#xD;
      (without dementia) with both sedentary lifestyle and nocturnal sleep complaints to examine&#xD;
      the effectiveness of a personalized behavioral intervention (compared to a control group)&#xD;
      embedded within a smart watch application in older adults. 94 cognitively intact elders and&#xD;
      21 older adults with mild cognitive impairment will be enrolled and randomly allocated to the&#xD;
      intervention or control group. Participants in the intervention arm will receive in person&#xD;
      exercise training sessions, and personalized, self-monitor physical activity, receive&#xD;
      interactive prompts, biweekly phone consultation with the research team, and financial&#xD;
      incentives for achieving weekly physical activity goals. The control group will receive&#xD;
      general education on physical activity in older adults and continue the routine daily&#xD;
      activity during the intervention period. The intervention for older adults without cognitive&#xD;
      impairment is 24 weeks and for older adults with mild cognitive impairment is 16 weeks.&#xD;

The CBB is a computer based cognitive battery that scores four core cognitive domains: processing speed, attention/vigilance, visual learning memory and visual working memory. The composite cognition score is the primary cognition measure used to measure global cognitive function. The score will range from 0-400, with a higher score indicating higher performance.</description>

    <description>In-person training with the exercise trainer ( 3 sessions for participants without cognitive impairments over 24 weeks &amp; 4 sessions for older adults with mild cognitive impairment over 16 weeks). Self-monitoring level of physical activity (steps &amp; minutes of moderate activity) using the smart watch. . The Google calendar and Fitbit apps will send messages and alerts to the subject's smart watch that encourage subjects to achieve subjects' daily goals. If a participant has low activity for 3 consecutive days, the research assistant will call the participant to either encourage the participant to adhere to the plan or provide a modified plan after consulting the exercise trainer. Phone consultation: Subjects will have biweekly phone consultation with the research team members to receive guidance and adjustment on activity plans.Financial incentives: when the daily activity goal is achieved for more than four days per week, a $5 reward will be given to subjects.</description>
