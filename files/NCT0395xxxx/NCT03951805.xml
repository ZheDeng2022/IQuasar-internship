  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares insulin 287 (a possible new medicine) to insulin glargine (a medicine&#xD;
      doctors can already prescribe) in people with type 2 diabetes. Different ways of changing the&#xD;
      dose of insulin 287 are also compared. This is done to find the best way to change the dose&#xD;
      of insulin 287. Participants will either get insulin 287 that they will have to inject once a&#xD;
      week or insulin glargine that participants will have to inject once a day. Which treatment&#xD;
      participants get is decided by chance. The study will last for about 5 months (23 weeks).&#xD;
      Participants will have 14 clinic visits and 6 phone calls with the study doctor. At 3 of the&#xD;
      clinic visits participants will be asked not to eat or drink anything (except for water) in&#xD;
      the last 8 hours before the visit. During the study, the study doctor will ask participants&#xD;
      to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  measure blood sugar every day with a blood sugar meter using a finger prick.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  write down different information in a diary daily and return this to the study doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  wear a medical device (sensor) that measure blood sugar all the time for 18 weeks (about&#xD;
           4 months) during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women cannot take part if pregnant, breastfeeding or plan to become pregnant during the study&#xD;
      period.&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage of Time in Target Range (TIR) 3.9-10.0 Millimoles Per Liter (mmol/L) (70-180 Milligrams Per Deciliter (mg/dL) Measured Using CGM (Continuous Glucose Monitoring)</measure>
    <time_frame>During the last 2 weeks of treatment (week 15 and 16)</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of time spent in glycaemic target range was calculated as 100 times the number of recorded measurements in glycaemic target range 3.9-10.0 mmol/L (70-180 mg/dL), both inclusive divided by the total number of recorded measurements. The endpoint was evaluated based on the data from the on-treatment without rescue medication observation period, which was the time period when a participant was considered exposed to trial product, excluding any period after initiation of a non-randomised insulin treatment (rescue medication). The endpoint is based on data recorded by CGM system. It was required that at least 70% of the planned CGM measurements during weeks 15-16 were available for endpoint data to be included in the analysis.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The trial was conducted at 38 sites in 7 countries as follows: Croatia (4), Germany (9), Hungary (3), Poland (4), Slovakia (5), Spain (4), United States (9). In addition, 1 site in Slovakia and 3 sites in the United States screened, but didn't randomise any subjects.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants were randomised to receive once weekly insulin 287 using one of 3 different titration algorithms (A, B, C), or once daily insulin glargine (titration algorithm D); as add-on to background therapy with metformin with or without dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i) and with or without sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i).</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Insulin 287 (Titration Algorithm A)</title>
          <description>Participants were to receive once weekly subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of insulin 287 for 16 weeks, using PDS290 prefilled pen-injector at a starting dose of 70 units (U). The dose was adjusted weekly during the treatment period using titration algorithm A with American Diabetes Association (ADA) glycaemic target of 4.4-7.2 mmol/L (80-130 mg/dL), based on 3 pre-breakfast self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) values measured on 2 previous days and on the day of the contact. If at least one pre-breakfast SMPG value was: &lt; 4.4 mmol/L: insulin dose reduced by 21 U. Otherwise, the dose adjustment was based on the mean of SMPG values. If the mean was between 4.4-7.2 mmol/L: no adjustment; &gt; 7.2 mmol/L: insulin dose increased by 21 U. All participants used metformin with or without DPP4i and with or without SGLT2i at the stable, pre-trial dose and at the same frequency during the entire treatment period unless due to safety concerns related to the background medication.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Time in Target Range (TIR) 3.9-10.0 Millimoles Per Liter (mmol/L) (70-180 Milligrams Per Deciliter (mg/dL) Measured Using CGM (Continuous Glucose Monitoring)</title>
        <description>The percentage of time spent in glycaemic target range was calculated as 100 times the number of recorded measurements in glycaemic target range 3.9-10.0 mmol/L (70-180 mg/dL), both inclusive divided by the total number of recorded measurements. The endpoint was evaluated based on the data from the on-treatment without rescue medication observation period, which was the time period when a participant was considered exposed to trial product, excluding any period after initiation of a non-randomised insulin treatment (rescue medication). The endpoint is based on data recorded by CGM system. It was required that at least 70% of the planned CGM measurements during weeks 15-16 were available for endpoint data to be included in the analysis.</description>

            <description>Participants were to receive once weekly subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of insulin 287 for 16 weeks, using PDS290 prefilled pen-injector at a starting dose of 70 units (U). The dose was adjusted weekly during the treatment period using titration algorithm A with American Diabetes Association (ADA) glycaemic target of 4.4-7.2 mmol/L (80-130 mg/dL), based on 3 pre-breakfast self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) values measured on 2 previous days and on the day of the contact. If at least one pre-breakfast SMPG value was: &lt; 4.4 mmol/L: insulin dose reduced by 21 U. Otherwise, the dose adjustment was based on the mean of SMPG values. If the mean was between 4.4-7.2 mmol/L: no adjustment; &gt; 7.2 mmol/L: insulin dose increased by 21 U. All participants used metformin with or without DPP4i and with or without SGLT2i at the stable, pre-trial dose and at the same frequency during the entire treatment period unless due to safety concerns related to the background medication.</description>

The dose was adjusted weekly during the treatment period using titration algorithm A with American Diabetes Association (ADA) glycaemic target of 4.4-7.2 mmol/L (80-130 mg/dL), based on 3 pre-breakfast self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) values measured on 2 previous days and on the day of the contact. If at least one pre-breakfast SMPG value was: &lt; 4.4 mmol/L: insulin dose reduced by 21 U. Otherwise, the dose adjustment was based on the mean of SMPG values. If the mean was between 4.4-7.2 mmol/L: no adjustment; &gt; 7.2 mmol/L: insulin dose increased by 21 U.

            <description>Participants were to receive once weekly subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of insulin 287 for 16 weeks, using PDS290 prefilled pen-injector at a starting dose of 70 units (U). The dose was adjusted weekly during the treatment period using titration algorithm A with American Diabetes Association (ADA) glycaemic target of 4.4-7.2 mmol/L (80-130 mg/dL), based on 3 pre-breakfast self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) values measured on 2 previous days and on the day of the contact. If at least one pre-breakfast SMPG value was: &lt; 4.4 mmol/L: insulin dose reduced by 21 U. Otherwise, the dose adjustment was based on the mean of SMPG values. If the mean was between 4.4-7.2 mmol/L: no adjustment; &gt; 7.2 mmol/L: insulin dose increased by 21 U. All participants used metformin with or without DPP4i and with or without SGLT2i at the stable, pre-trial dose and at the same frequency during the entire treatment period unless due to safety concerns related to the background medication.</description>
