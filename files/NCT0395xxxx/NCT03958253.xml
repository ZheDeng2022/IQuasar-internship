  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The successful implementation of lung cancer screening across diverse setting requires&#xD;
      working with the community and primary care practices. Collaborating across diverse&#xD;
      community-based sites will employ local knowledge and culture in the understanding of the&#xD;
      health problem and identifying and implementing solutions that are appropriate for all&#xD;
      partners (patients, primary care, referral centers). Enhanced, culturally-competent&#xD;
      communication with patients at high risk for lung cancer can narrow inequities in screening&#xD;
      awareness, referral, and utilization, as well as improve lung cancer outcomes across diverse&#xD;
      patients and communities. Promoting partnerships among physicians, staff, and patients;&#xD;
      creating routines; and tailoring materials to each clinician's situation have been show to&#xD;
      increase the proportion of patients receiving screening.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial in which the intervention condition (toolbox) is sequentially assigned to participating hospitals (screening centers) in 6 clusters at different time-delays and where pre-intervention data serves as the control. By the end of the study, all clusters have been exposed to the intervention and each cluster has provided data for the control and intervention conditions. Independent samples of primary care providers are enrolled at each period within a cluster, thus, it is a repeated cross-sectional study. The order of the entry into the intervention phase is randomized based on levels of readiness</intervention_model_description>

During the 3 hour train-the-trainer session, the selected staff from the referral sites will learn about the program, receive an orientation to the toolbox elements, and discuss how to adapt the elements of the toolbox to their referral sites.</description>
