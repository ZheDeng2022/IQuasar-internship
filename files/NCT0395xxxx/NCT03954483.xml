    <textblock>
      New technologies are needed to help diagnose anxiety disorders. EVestG has facilitated the&#xD;
      identification of numerous possible biomarkers of several psychiatric disorders. Some EVestG&#xD;
      features seem to be caused by differences in low-frequency modulation that is consistent&#xD;
      (both in frequency and behaviour) with the hippocampal rhythm (theta), which is known to play&#xD;
      a role in anxiety. Critically, there is ample support in the literature for an anatomical and&#xD;
      functional basis for the modulation of vestibular signals via theta. If anxiety could be&#xD;
      measured continuously, perhaps throughout a patient's day, or throughout a task, it might be&#xD;
      able to confirm an anxiety disorder. However, current techniques for measuring theta are&#xD;
      highly invasive, performed rarely, and only in epilepsy patients. EVestG technology, however,&#xD;
      is non-invasive, and could potentially record anxiety levels in any subject for extended&#xD;
      periods of time. The proposed study will attempt to identify hippocampal theta in vestibular&#xD;
      signals in healthy participants through a double-blind administration of two different drugs&#xD;
      that are dissimilar both pharmacologically and in acute clinical effects but which are known&#xD;
      to reduce the theta rhythm.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate whether the gross electrical activity of the outer ear canal contains the&#xD;
      hippocampal theta rhythm (theta) - a potential biomarker for anxiety - and to identify&#xD;
      potential modulatory effects that theta may have on vestibular signals, using&#xD;
      electrovestibulography (EVestG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty-two (42) individuals, aged between 18 and 40 years, who report no psychological&#xD;
      treatment in the past year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The means of recruiting participants will conform with University of Manitoba Research Ethics&#xD;
      Board guidelines. All participants will provide written, informed consent prior to&#xD;
      participation. Additional consent for the drug experiment will be provided by a physician on&#xD;
      the research team who will also write prescriptions for the study drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty-two (42) participants will be randomly allocated to one of three parallel groups (of&#xD;
      equal size): The 'triazolam group,' in which participants will receive 0.25 mg of (oral)&#xD;
      triazolam prior to the experiments; the 'buspirone group,' in which participants will receive&#xD;
      10 mg of (oral) buspirone prior to the experiments; and the 'placebo group,' in which&#xD;
      participants will receive a placebo pill prior to the experiments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of two experiments: &quot;Whole-Body Motion&quot; (WBM); and the &quot;Stop Signal&#xD;
      Task&quot; (SST). Throughout these experiments, Electroencephalography (EEG) activity will be&#xD;
      simultaneously recorded from the outer ear canal, (via EVestG electrodes), and the frontal&#xD;
      F7, Fz and F8 sites, (using a minimalist configuration of surface electrodes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants who meet inclusion criteria and provide informed consent will participate in&#xD;
      these experiments and complete a series of tests at the Riverview Health Centre, over a&#xD;
      period of approximately 2-3 hours. These tests include: an audiogram and a balance test; as&#xD;
      well as a series of questionnaires that screen for depression and assess cognition, symptom&#xD;
      severity, fatigue and balance. The procedure may also include frontal brain asymmetry&#xD;
      measures via surface electrode EEG recordings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the SST experiment, the WBM experiment, and resting states (between rotations), we&#xD;
      hypothesize that for the three study groups: 1) any 4-12 Hz modulation of vestibular field&#xD;
      potentials will be lowest (in frequency) in the drug groups and highest in the placebo group;&#xD;
      2) the drug groups will have EEG spectral peaks in the 4-12 Hz range that are the lowest (in&#xD;
      frequency) while the placebo group peaks will be the highest; 3) overall 4-12 Hz EEG power&#xD;
      will be lowest in the drug groups and highest in the placebo group; 4) in general, 4-12 Hz&#xD;
      EEG activity and 4-12 Hz entrainment of EVestG field potentials (FPs) will be most prominent&#xD;
      and occur most often in the placebo group and least often in the drug groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The placebo group is expected to show the highest degree of theta-range coherence between&#xD;
      mPFC and outer ear canal activity, especially during WBM movements and intermediate delay SST&#xD;
      Stop trials, but also during resting state. The drug groups are predicted to exhibit the&#xD;
      lowest degree of this coherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Theta frequency is expected to correlate with state anxiety to the degree that it will&#xD;
      separate high- and low-scoring individuals on the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) test.&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that trait anxiety, (also measured by the STAI test), will correlate with&#xD;
      features unrelated to theta but similar to those identified in previous EVestG studies that&#xD;
      involved depressed patients, where differentiating features were found in average FP&#xD;
      waveforms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note: During the COVID-19 pandemic, some of the procedures in this section will be modified.&#xD;
      (Please see Appendix A of the protocol for standard operating procedures during the Covid-19&#xD;
      pandemic).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have the details of the study explained to them before they sign a written&#xD;
      consent form. They will then be given the (2-minute) Standing Balance Test (SBT) and the&#xD;
      (5-minute) Audiogram. [Any subjects that fail the SBT will be given the (5-minute) Vestibular&#xD;
      Disorders Activities of Daily Living Scale (VADL) questionnaire, and subjects who fail the&#xD;
      VADL or Audiogram will be excluded]. They will then receive a capsule that contains either&#xD;
      0.25 mg of triazolam, 10 mg of buspirone, or a placebo pill, where the contents of the&#xD;
      capsule will be randomly determined by a computer code. Next, they will complete a series of&#xD;
      tests and questionnaires. First, the (5-minute) Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS) and&#xD;
      (1-minute) Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS) will be conducted. Next, they will complete the&#xD;
      (10-minute) Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) test before filling out both the (10-minute)&#xD;
      Eysenck Personality Questionnaire - Revised (EPQ-R) and (10-minute) Spielberger State-Trait&#xD;
      Anxiety Inventory (STAI) questionnaires. Some of the questionnaires will be administered by a&#xD;
      computer program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the experiments, head circumferences will be measured, and electrodes will be&#xD;
      attached at F7, Fz and F8 (for analysis) and AFz (Electro Cap Int. Gnd), according to the&#xD;
      international 10/20 system; as well as above, below, and to the right of the right eye, and&#xD;
      to the left of the left eye; and on both mastoids; with impedances lowered to below 5 kâ„¦.&#xD;
      Next, EVestG electrodes will be positioned, (as per Section 4.3 of the protocol).&#xD;
      Electrocardiogram electrodes may also be employed near the wrists/ankles. Participants will&#xD;
      then be led to the hydraulic chair that they will remain seated in during the experiments.&#xD;
      The abovementioned tests, questionnaires and electrode placements should take about 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first experiment is the SST (see Section 4.15 of the protocol), for which the hydraulic&#xD;
      chair will remain motionless. A laptop will be placed in front of the participant. The SST&#xD;
      takes roughly 15 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second experiment consists of whole-body rotations and translations in the hydraulic&#xD;
      chair, (as described in Section 4.3). Each movement will be performed twice, with four&#xD;
      different motions from the sitting upright position and two from the supine position. This&#xD;
      experiment should take about 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next, the STAI questionnaire will be administered again, and participants will be screened&#xD;
      for depression and cognitive decline with the (15-minute) Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating&#xD;
      Scale (MADRS) and (10-minute) Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), respectively. The&#xD;
      (15-minute) Mini-Internal Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.) will also be used to screen&#xD;
      for symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, all electrodes, tape and superficial gel will be removed from the participant, whom&#xD;
      the investigator will encourage to wash their ears with warm water as soon as possible. A&#xD;
      total of 2-3 hours will have passed since the capsule was taken. Participants will remain on&#xD;
      the fourth floor of the Administration Building at RHC and will be monitored until any drug&#xD;
      effects will have worn off. They will be reminded not to operate a motor vehicle to return&#xD;
      home and will have arranged an alternate mode of transportation beforehand and will be&#xD;
      provided a data sheet for the drug they received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses will include MANOVAs and t-tests on power spectra from EVestG and EEG&#xD;
      recordings to look for differences between groups. Correlation measures will be used to&#xD;
      identify coherence between EVestG and EEG recordings, as well as between symptom rating&#xD;
      scores and spectra from EVestG and EEG recordings.&#xD;
