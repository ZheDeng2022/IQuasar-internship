    <textblock>
      The CUSTOM research project represents a complex intervention. The project aim of the&#xD;
      intervention is, through the delivery of culturally sensitive Diabetes self-management&#xD;
      education and support, to support ethnic minorities with type 2 diabetes in making&#xD;
      health-promoting decisions about their care and gaining insight into their goals, values and&#xD;
      motivation to improve their daily diabetes self-management. The target group comprises ethnic&#xD;
      minorities whose native language is Arabic, Urdu or Turkish.&#xD;

      The CUSTOM research project represents a complex intervention. The project aim of the&#xD;
      intervention is, through the delivery of culturally sensitive DSMES, to support ethnic&#xD;
      minorities with type 2 diabetes in making health-promoting decisions about their care and&#xD;
      gaining insight into their goals, values and motivation to improve their daily diabetes&#xD;
      self-management. The target group comprises ethnic minorities whose native language is&#xD;
      Arabic, Urdu or Turkish. The intervention has been developed in collaboration with the target&#xD;
      group and health care professionals from Centre for Diabetes (CfD) in Copenhagen&#xD;
      Municipality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CUSTOM will explore feasibility and effectiveness of the intervention including the&#xD;
      mechanisms through which outcomes occur and contexts where outcomes are likely to be&#xD;
      replicable. The intervention builds on the framework of complex interventions(26), and is&#xD;
      designed as an pragmatic randomised controlled trial in three arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focus on fidelity, appropriateness and acceptability of the developed intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What factors and structures are necessary to facilitate DSMES access and retention among&#xD;
           the target group?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Which methods and tools supporting diabetes decision making and problem solving are&#xD;
           acceptable and feasible among the target group?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What educational strategies promote Health Care Professionals' (HCPs') communication&#xD;
           with the target group?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focus on exploring effectiveness of the intervention, the mechanisms through which outcomes&#xD;
      occur and contexts where outcomes are likely to be replicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To what extent does the intervention lead to better outcomes (e.g., HbA1c and&#xD;
           participant-reported outcomes) than 'usual care' for the target group and what&#xD;
           mechanisms for the effect of the intervention can be identified? And are there&#xD;
           differences according to the setting, of which the intervention is delivered; a) in a&#xD;
           community health centre and b) a local community setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What characterizes contexts that are most conducive to positive outcomes?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What barriers and possibilities exist related to implementing culturally sensitive DSMES&#xD;
           in different municipal settings targeting ethnic minority groups?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Which contextual factors determine whether the identified mechanisms lead to intended&#xD;
           outcomes?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What are the long-term effects of the intervention on measured outcomes?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design CUSTOM is considered a complex intervention due to many interacting components&#xD;
      in its design, complex behaviour changes in those delivering and receiving the intervention,&#xD;
      many stakeholders, and highly variable outcomes. The trial will be undertaken as a pragmatic&#xD;
      trial using cluster randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will be tested in three arms: Participants will be randomised into 3 arms Group A:&#xD;
      Centre for Diabetes, Copenhagen Municipality, n = 103 Group B: Local community setting in&#xD;
      Tingbjerg, Copenhagen Municipality, n = 103 Group C: Usual care in the west area of&#xD;
      Copenhagen, municipalities of Høje-Taastrup, Hvidovre, Albertslund, Brøndby and Ishøj, n =&#xD;
      103 Figure 1 Study Design 9. Interventions 9.1 Group A and B: Group A and B will receive the&#xD;
      same interventions but in different contexts - a local community setting and a diabetes care&#xD;
      centre. The intervention will be pilot tested in the local community and if necessary&#xD;
      adjusted to local contexts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a design-based research, the intervention has been developed in collaboration with&#xD;
      researchers, the target group and healthcare professionals from Centre for Diabetes (CfD) in&#xD;
      Copenhagen Municipality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The group-based course will include 6 sessions of approximately 3 hours. Sessions are&#xD;
      constructed around themes such as; diabetes knowledge and complication, mental health, diet,&#xD;
      physical activity, Ramadan, medicine and include practical exercises such as blood sugar&#xD;
      measurements, walking etc. The healthcare professionals delivering the education consists of&#xD;
      an interdisciplinary team of both a nurse, dietitian, physiotherapist, a translator and a&#xD;
      peer educator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CUSTOM intervention consists of three elements: philosophy/values, educator behaviours&#xD;
      and 12 specific dialogue tools. These three elements are all equally important in the&#xD;
      organisation and completion of a good and culturally sensitive diabetes education targeting&#xD;
      ethnic minorities. The intervention is based on the concept CUSTOM which is developed with&#xD;
      regards to the healthcare professionals' approaches, methods and existing educational&#xD;
      activities. The concept consists of 12 health education tools accompanied by a comprehensive&#xD;
      guide. The success of the tools developed in CUSTOM rely on the values held by the suppliers&#xD;
      of the education and by the health care professional's competences to apply the specific&#xD;
      dialogue tools.&#xD;
