  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a common chronic condition that causes substantial morbidity among children and&#xD;
      much of it is attributable to medication non-adherence. The National Asthma Education and&#xD;
      Prevention Program (NAEPP) and the American Academy of Asthma, Allergy, and Immunology have&#xD;
      urged others to develop more effective adherence programs.Schools are a logical setting to&#xD;
      deploy such interventions because they are where children congregate, spend much of their&#xD;
      day, and are frequently monitored. Because many schools serve a high proportion of minority&#xD;
      and low-income students, engaging them presents a unique opportunity to reach populations who&#xD;
      experience the greatest burden of preventable morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supervising inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) use in the school setting can increase medication&#xD;
      adherence and reduce episodes of poor asthma control. Under certain conditions, it can also&#xD;
      be cost-effective. However, recruiting children from school settings tends to enroll children&#xD;
      with mild asthma and infrequent health care use. Therefore, initiating supervised treatment&#xD;
      in these children tends to burden school personnel with unnecessary work and diminishes the&#xD;
      program's cost-effectiveness. To address this inefficiency, the investigators propose to&#xD;
      recruit children who are discharged from the Hospital Emergency Departments (EDs) following&#xD;
      successful treatment of an asthma attack. Such children have much higher risk of a future&#xD;
      asthma attack than their peers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) com- prises10&#xD;
      hospital-affiliated EDs that serve 1 million acutely ill and injured children annually. Their&#xD;
      primary research mission is to reduce childhood morbidity and mortality by establishing&#xD;
      creative partnerships between emergency medical service providers and their surrounding&#xD;
      communities. The networks size and geographic diversity make it uniquely situated to develop,&#xD;
      implement, and evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of ED-Initiated School-Based Asthma&#xD;
      Medication Supervision (ED-SAMS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately one-third of children treated for an asthma attack within PECARN experience a&#xD;
      second ED-managed attack within 6 months. While the NAEPP guidelines recommend that long-term&#xD;
      ICS treatment should be initiated at ED discharge, &lt;20% of children actually receive a&#xD;
      prescription for controller therapy. Observational data indicate that patients who use ICS&#xD;
      following discharge are almost half as likely as non-users to experience a repeat ED visit.&#xD;
      Many have also argued that ED-initiated treatment could be cost-effective. However, simply&#xD;
      providing patients with a prescription does not ensure that they will actually use it once&#xD;
      discharged. To ensure better medication adherence, the investigators propose to dispense ICS&#xD;
      at discharge and supervise its use in the school setting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 8% of children in the United States have asthma. Each year, these children&#xD;
      experience 4 million asthma attacks that result in 725,000 ED visits and 100,000&#xD;
      hospitalizations. Unsurprisingly, the direct medical expenditures of children with asthma are&#xD;
      75-90% higher than those of children without asthma. In 2016, this amount totaled 40 billion&#xD;
      dollars. Substantial indirect costs are incurred when parents miss work to care for their&#xD;
      children who miss school. These additional costs raise the total economic burden of asthma to&#xD;
      $80 billion annually. Frequent asthma-related school absences impair academic achievement and&#xD;
      social functioning. This burden falls disproportionately on minority, low-income, and urban&#xD;
      populations. For example, black children have 60% more ED visits and 75% more&#xD;
      hospitalizations than white children even though they have similar asthma attack rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adherence to ICS is notoriously poor.20, 22, 23 While 86% of privately insured patients who&#xD;
      receive an ICS prescription will refill it within 30 days, only 64% will subsequently refill&#xD;
      it again within 180 days. Even worse, only 3% will refill enough medication to cover greater&#xD;
      than or equal to 75% of prescribed days with average medication possession being&#xD;
      approximately 20%. Black and Hispanic patients are 20% less likely to refill their initial&#xD;
      prescription and are 40% less likely to refill enough medication to cover greater than or&#xD;
      equal to 75% of prescribed days. Adherence is similarly poor among the publicly insured.&#xD;
      Among Medicaid-insured children, ICS is only refilled enough to cover 20% of prescribed days;&#xD;
      fewer than 15% will refill enough to cover greater than or equal to 50% of days. At any given&#xD;
      time, 40% of children with asthma are not well-controlled and much of this is attributable to&#xD;
      nonadherence. Simulation and modeling studies suggest that maximizing ICS adherence among&#xD;
      those prescribed ICS could reduce health care utilization by 25-45%. Even greater reductions&#xD;
      are hypothesized if ICS prescribing could be expanded to all patients at risk of serious&#xD;
      asthma-related exacerbations. However, a recent Cochrane review concluded that current&#xD;
      methods of improving adherence for chronic health problems are mostly complex and not very&#xD;
      effective. New adherence strategies will be needed if society is to achieve the gains&#xD;
      suggested possible by simulations. Medication non-adherence among patients with chronic&#xD;
      disease is a multi-dimensional challenge. The cost and convenience of obtaining medication&#xD;
      (health system factors) and the motivation needed to adhere with a daily health habit&#xD;
      (patient-related factors) are common barriers to adherence that are addressed by this study.&#xD;
      Medication acquisition costs deter patients from refilling and refilling prescription&#xD;
      medications. Even small $1-3 co-payments can appreciably reduce adherence. However, imposing&#xD;
      additional time costs by requiring more frequent refills has an even greater impact. Time&#xD;
      costs can add $50-100 per prescription. Therefore, the $155 out-of-pocket spending estimate&#xD;
      for children's asthma medication likely understates the true economic burden. Dispensing ICS&#xD;
      in the ED is therefore expected to improve adherence by reducing the substantial time and&#xD;
      travel costs associated with medication acquisition. ICS treatment also burdens patients by&#xD;
      requiring them to adopt a daily health habit. For children, this burden primarily falls on&#xD;
      parents. Parents weigh the perceived benefits of treatment against their perceptions of&#xD;
      treatment risk and burden. Given that asthma symptoms fluctuate in response to treatment and&#xD;
      season, many purposefully reduce medication administration when their child's symptoms wane&#xD;
      (volitional non-adherence).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the absence of treatment, the underlying inflammation is allowed to worsen and&#xD;
      exacerbation risk increases. This reactive pattern of medication use is substantiated by the&#xD;
      fact that 37% of all prescriptions for ICS are refilled on the same day as prescriptions for&#xD;
      oral corticosteroid, suggesting after the exacerbation, not before it.18 Even more&#xD;
      disturbing, less than 50% of children who refilled a prescription for oral corticosteroid&#xD;
      were ever noted to have refilled an ICS prescription, meaning most lacked any access to&#xD;
      controller medication.18 Our proposal addresses the problem of primary non-adherence by&#xD;
      dispensing medication in the ED and addresses non-adherence by arranging supervised use in&#xD;
      the school setting.&#xD;
