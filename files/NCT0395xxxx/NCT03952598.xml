      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glioma is a type of brain cancer. Some of these tumors have gene mutations. These mutations&#xD;
      can cause a substance called 2-HG to build up in the brain. This makes the tumors more&#xD;
      aggressive. Researchers want to better understand 2-HG buildup in the brain. They hope this&#xD;
      can help them design better ways to test for gliomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To monitor the level of 2-HG in the brains of people with gliomas that have mutations in the&#xD;
      IDH1 or IDH2 genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 and older with gliomas with mutations in the IDH1 or IDH2 genes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical and cancer history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reviews of their symptoms and ability to perform normal activities&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI scan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples of their tumor from a past surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Documentation of their diagnosis and mutation status&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have an initial evaluation. This will include repeats of screening tests.&#xD;
      It will also include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurological exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRS and MRI scans of the brain: Participants will lie on a table that slides into a metal&#xD;
      cylinder. A coil or soft padding will be placed around their head. They will have a contrast&#xD;
      agent injected into a vein. Pictures will be taken of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have follow-up visits every 2-6 month for the rest of their life. Visits&#xD;
      will include scans.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Glioma is the most common malignant brain tumor. Genes coding for isocitrate&#xD;
           dehydrogenase (IDH), a metabolic enzyme, are frequently mutated in gliomas, particularly&#xD;
           lower-grade gliomas (LGGs). IDH mutation causes a unique tumor biology, including the&#xD;
           accumulation of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), an oncometabolite, which in turn causes&#xD;
           genomic hypermethylation and tumorigenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Despite having a better prognosis compared to their IDH WT counterparts, IDH-mutant LGGs&#xD;
           undergo a slow but unremitting higher-grade transformation (HT) and eventually become&#xD;
           high grade gliomas (HGGs). A subset of patients with transformed HGGs develop a&#xD;
           hypermutator phenotype (HMP), possibly related to previous treatment with alkylating&#xD;
           agents and radiotherapy. The timeline for the development of HT and HMP is unpredictable&#xD;
           and there is no known way to prevent them from happening, largely due to a lack of&#xD;
           understanding their biological mechanisms and lack of a non-invasive approach for&#xD;
           potential early detection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of the brain can detect 2-HG in a tumor&#xD;
           harboring IDH mutation. There has been an increased interest in using quantitative 2-HG&#xD;
           by MRS as a biomarker for IDH-mutant gliomas. This clinical study will allow a&#xD;
           longitudinal monitoring of quantitative 2-HG by MRS in patients with IDH-mutant gliomas.&#xD;
           We hypothesize that a significant increase in 2HG level is correlated with HT and/or&#xD;
           HMP. The change in 2-HG level in conjunction with evaluation of tumor cellularity and&#xD;
           other metabolite markers such as choline, creatinine and N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) will&#xD;
           likely to provide insights into metabolic alterations that may correlate with HT/HMP and&#xD;
           potentially provide the predictive biomarker for early detection of HT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To monitor the quantitative levels of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) longitudinally in patients&#xD;
      with IDH-mutant gliomas via proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IDH 1 or 2 mutation confirmed by DNA sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age greater than or equal to18 years, KPS greater than or equal to 60%&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is prospective observational study. We will recruit at least 250 eligible patients&#xD;
           in the next 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The relationship between the occurrence of HT and the changes in 2-HG level using the&#xD;
           proportional hazard model.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) for patients&#xD;
                  withcreatinine levels above institutional normal (Measured or calculated&#xD;
                  creatinine clearance (GFR can also be used in place of creatinine or CrCl)).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability of subject or Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) to understand and the&#xD;
             willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with any coexisting medical or psychiatric condition that is likely to&#xD;
             interfere with study procedures and/or results (such as allergy to gadolinium&#xD;
             contrast, metal implants and so on).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded because MRI contrast, planned to be used on this study,&#xD;
             may be dangerous for the fetus. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for&#xD;
             adverse events in nursing infants secondary to using of MRI c ntrast, breastfeeding&#xD;
             should be discontinued for 72 hours following study imaging.&#xD;
