  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis leads to a deregulated host response that can lead to organ failure. During sepsis,&#xD;
      experimental and clinical data suggest the occurrence of mitochondrial dysfunctions,&#xD;
      particularly in circulating muscle and monocytes, which may contribute to organ failure and&#xD;
      death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lower respiratory infection is the leading cause of death from infectious causes. Mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation (MV) is required in 20% of cases of bacterial pneumopathy with Streptococcus&#xD;
      pneumoniae (S.p.) , with mortality reaching 50%. There are then frequently criteria for acute&#xD;
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), combining bilateral lung involvement and marked&#xD;
      hypoxemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cyclic stretching of lung cells induced by MV causes sterile inflammation and tissue damage&#xD;
      (i.e. ventilator-induced lung injury [VILI]), which can cause cellular dysfunction that alter&#xD;
      the immune response, particularly during ARDS. This is why the application of a so-called&#xD;
      protective MV is then required. However, this does not prevent about one-third of patients&#xD;
      from showing signs of alveolar overdistension, as evidenced by an increase in motor pressure&#xD;
      (MP) (MP≥ 15 cmH2O), associated with an increase in mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The deleterious effects of MV could be explained by the occurrence of mitochondrial&#xD;
      abnormalities. Indeed, the cyclic stretching of lung cells leads to dysfunction in the&#xD;
      respiratory chain and the production of free oxygen radicals (FOS), altering membrane&#xD;
      permeability. These phenomena could promote VILI, facilitate the translocation of bacteria&#xD;
      from the lung to the systemic compartment and lead to alterations in immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our model of S.p. pneumopathy in rabbits, animals on MV develop more severe lung disorders&#xD;
      (lack of pulmonary clearance of bacteria, bacterial translocation in the blood, excess&#xD;
      mortality), compared to animals on spontaneous ventilation (SV). Intracellular pulmonary&#xD;
      mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) concentrations, a reflection of the mitochondrial pool, are&#xD;
      significantly decreased in ventilated rabbits compared to SV rabbits and in infected rabbits&#xD;
      compared to uninfected rabbits. At the same time, the mitochondrial content of circulating&#xD;
      cells decreased early (H8) in all infected rabbits, but was only restored in rabbits in SV,&#xD;
      those who survived pneumonia (Blot et al, poster ECCMID 2015, submitted article). These data&#xD;
      suggest an alteration in the mechanisms that restore mitochondrial homeostasis (mitochondrial&#xD;
      biogenesis and mitophagy) during the dual infection/MV agression, which may explain the&#xD;
      observed excess mortality. Other work by our team illustrates the importance of these&#xD;
      phenomena by showing in a mouse model of polymicrobial infection that inhibition of&#xD;
      mitophagia in macrophages promotes survival (Patoli et al, in preparation). Human data on&#xD;
      this subject are non-existent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phenomena of mitochondrial dysfunction nevertheless deserve to be explored in humans&#xD;
      during the combined MV/pneumopathy aggression in order to understand its possible impact on&#xD;
      the effectiveness of the host's immune response. In a personalized medicine approach, these&#xD;
      data would open up prospects for targeted therapies, capable of activating mitochondrial&#xD;
      biogenesis and/or modulating mitophagia, to prevent organ dysfunction and mortality during&#xD;
      severe CALs treated with antibiotic therapy.&#xD;
