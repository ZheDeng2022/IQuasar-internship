  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Health disparities have been documented in same-sex partnered women, including higher rates&#xD;
      of cardiovascular disease, Type 2 diabetes, cancers, and mental health disorders. Higher&#xD;
      rates of smoking, substance use, and obesity are behavioral risk factors that contribute to&#xD;
      these chronic health problems. Living in rural areas with fewer social supports and less&#xD;
      access to culturally sensitive healthcare services may also contribute to health disparities&#xD;
      in sexual minorities. Their stigmatized identity is linked to minority stress, a&#xD;
      well-documented social determinant of health behaviors and outcomes. Coping responses are an&#xD;
      important couple-level mechanism that link stigma-related (minority) stress and health in&#xD;
      same-sex couples. Relationship education (RE) programming is a potentially effective approach&#xD;
      to increasing positive dyadic-level coping skills that support health. In a sample of 40&#xD;
      female same-sex couples, investigators will test the hypothesis that couples who complete&#xD;
      newly revised, web-based RE modules that target health-related coping responses to&#xD;
      stigma-related stress will report immediate (post-intervention) and persistent (3-month&#xD;
      follow up) positive effects on their relationship quality (e.g., positive communication and&#xD;
      problem-solving, relationship satisfaction, perceived partner support), stigma-related coping&#xD;
      behaviors, and health (e.g., reduced substance use, depression/anxiety, physical health&#xD;
      symptoms). This intervention represents one of the first efforts to test the effects of a&#xD;
      culturally appropriate web-based relationship education tool that specifically targets&#xD;
      health-related coping behaviors in rural female same-sex couples, a stigmatized, high-risk,&#xD;
      under-researched and under-resourced population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Central Appalachian women in same-sex relationships experience health disparities. Higher&#xD;
      rates of smoking, other substance use, and obesity are risk factors that contribute to health&#xD;
      disparities in Central Appalachia women, and these health risk factors have been also been&#xD;
      implicated in the health disparities faced by women who are same-sex partnered. In a national&#xD;
      probability sample, lesbian and bisexual young adult women, compared to heterosexual young&#xD;
      adult women, reported higher rates of smoking and heavy drinking, had significantly higher&#xD;
      BMIs, and were significantly more likely to report an illness in the previous two weeks. The&#xD;
      intervention in this pilot study is based on minority stress and relationship theories and&#xD;
      current empirical findings reviewed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stigma-related stress, a chronic form of social stress, largely accounts for health&#xD;
      disparities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stigma affects health by creating conditions of chronic stress in those with stigmatized&#xD;
      identities. This chronic (minority) stress has been linked to diminished mental and physical&#xD;
      health. Specifically in rural LGB samples, stigma-related stress has been linked to higher&#xD;
      levels of psychological distress (e.g., depression and anxiety), increased substance use, and&#xD;
      overall poorer physical health, Same-sex couple members experience stigma-related stress&#xD;
      because of experiences of discrimination and prejudice that targets them as individuals, as a&#xD;
      couple, and, as a stigmatized social identity group. In their daily interactions, Central&#xD;
      Appalachian same-sex couples experience discrimination and prejudice at work, in schools and&#xD;
      churches, and in their families and communities. Even though same-sex couples in Central&#xD;
      Appalachia can legally marry, stigma and discrimination persist. No state law in this region&#xD;
      protects same-sex couples from discrimination in services, employment or housing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The theory of minority stress as applied to LGB individuals describes a psychological process&#xD;
      in which chronic experiences of prejudice and discrimination lead to fear and expectations of&#xD;
      rejection, concerns about possible consequences of disclosing or concealing one's sexual&#xD;
      minority identity or same-sex relationship, and internalized negativity or shame about one's&#xD;
      relationship and one's identity. Minority stress among LGB-identified people appears to be on&#xD;
      the increase nationally due to recent political events that threaten hard-won progress toward&#xD;
      full equality of same-sex partnered individuals and their families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coping responses are an important mechanism that links stigma-related stress and health. To&#xD;
      manage these chronic stigma-related stressors, LGB individuals use positive and/or negative&#xD;
      coping responses that may buffer or exacerbate their effects of these stressors on health.&#xD;
      Findings suggest that coping responses are an important mechanism linking stigma-related&#xD;
      stress to poorer health outcomes. Therefore, helping this population to cope more effectively&#xD;
      with stigma-related stress can buffer its negative health effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Same-sex couples share minority stress and strengths. Same-sex couples' relationships can&#xD;
      simultaneously be the target of discrimination and prejudice and also the primary source of&#xD;
      support for coping with that discrimination and prejudice. Conceptual models based in&#xD;
      relationship science and minority stress theory and recent empirical evidence suggests that&#xD;
      same-sex couples share minority stress. For example, when one couple member experiences&#xD;
      discrimination at work, the minority stress that it triggers also affects the minority stress&#xD;
      level of the other couple member. In other cases, the couple relationship itself is the&#xD;
      target of discrimination, for instance, when extended family members refuse to accept the&#xD;
      couple. Shared minority stress can take a toll on relationship quality unless couples find&#xD;
      effective ways to cope. Distressed couples who rely on inadequate or unhealthy coping&#xD;
      strategies are at risk for mental and physical health problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, specific strengths and resiliencies enable same-sex couples to create&#xD;
      satisfying and stable relationships even in the context of stigma-related stress. For&#xD;
      example, female couples have demonstrated strengths in forming egalitarian partnerships that&#xD;
      include sharing responsibility for the emotional climate of the relationship household and a&#xD;
      commitment to supporting each other's health-related behaviors. Together these findings&#xD;
      suggest the importance of intervening at the dyadic level by using couple-level strengths to&#xD;
      enhance relationship skills and positive health-related coping behaviors to address&#xD;
      stigma-related (minority) stress. Helping female same-sex couples to develop their&#xD;
      relationship skills and use them to cope effectively with stigma-related stress in ways that&#xD;
      support each other's health and well-being will help to address mental and physical health&#xD;
      disparities in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relationship education (RE) programming is a potentially effective approach to increasing&#xD;
      dyadic-level coping skills that support health-related behavior. Compared to different-sex&#xD;
      couples, married/partnered sexual minority women receive less social support for their&#xD;
      relationship from their families and communities, and as a result they tend to rely more&#xD;
      heavily on their relationship for support. In addition to a lack of family and community&#xD;
      support, same-sex couples in Central Appalachia often lack friendship networks that include&#xD;
      other same-sex couples who could serve as role models and resources. Thus, Central Appalachia&#xD;
      female same-sex couple can benefit from an accessible, evidence-based intervention that&#xD;
      supports their relationship well-being, an important foundation for health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general, the purpose of RE is to increase knowledge and teach skills that will circumvent&#xD;
      the development of severe problems in the future. RE programs have been shown to benefit&#xD;
      married and unmarried different-sex couples across racial/ethnic and socio-economic&#xD;
      backgrounds by effecting reliable change in communication and relationship satisfaction.&#xD;
      Optimal RE programs should be tailored to the specific client population, accessible,&#xD;
      grounded in theory and research, and directed at reducing risk factors and increasing&#xD;
      protective factors at the individual and couple level. To date, RE programs have been limited&#xD;
      to different-sex couples. Yet, prominent RE researchers have proposed the RE approaches that&#xD;
      use same-sex couples' relationship skills and strengths to cope effectively with&#xD;
      stigma-related stress are well-suited to support the health and well-being of these couples&#xD;
      and their families. The current project builds upon and extends an RE workshop for female&#xD;
      same-sex couples, which is based in relationship science and minority stress theory and has&#xD;
      demonstrated post-intervention effects on relationship quality. In this randomized wait-list&#xD;
      control trial, same-sex female couples achieved significant improvement in their relationship&#xD;
      quality and communication skills that was maintained three months after the conclusion of the&#xD;
      program. However, there was no evidence of program effects on stress or perceived support.&#xD;
      Further, participants reported that the units on stress and social support were only somewhat&#xD;
      helpful and could benefit from the inclusion of more specific strategies and skills. The&#xD;
      current project will build upon and address limitations of previous research by piloting and&#xD;
      testing the effectiveness of a revised program that uses newly developed modules to teach&#xD;
      couples to use their relationship skills to cope with stigma-related stress in ways that&#xD;
      support their long-term health and well-being (Aim 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some evidence suggests that web-based relationship interventions (for different-sex couples)&#xD;
      are superior to no treatment. In distressed different-sex couples, a web-based couple&#xD;
      intervention significantly improved relationship quality and reduced pre-intervention&#xD;
      symptoms of anxiety, depression, and physical health problems when compared to wait-list&#xD;
      controls. The current project will extend previous work by adapting the revised RET to a&#xD;
      web-based format to make it more accessible to rural female same-sex couples and evaluating&#xD;
      feasibility, acceptability, adherence, and satisfaction (Aim 2).&#xD;
