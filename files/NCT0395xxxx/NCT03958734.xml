  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to examine the effect of high-fat meals on the health&#xD;
      of blood vessels. In addition, the study will examine how exercise/fitness/physical activity&#xD;
      impacts blood vessels after consumption of a high-fat meal.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is the first in a series of studies examining the impact of high-fat meals on blood&#xD;
      vessels. During the preliminary visit of this study, eligible participants' resting metabolic&#xD;
      rate, arm flow mediated dilation, and leg flow mediate dilation will be measured. They will&#xD;
      complete handgrip and plantar flexion exercise tasks. Finally, they will be given a physical&#xD;
      activity monitor to wear for 7 days. At their first visit, participants will eat a high-fat&#xD;
      meal and blood will be drawn to measure blood vessel health. They will also repeat the arm&#xD;
      flow mediated dilation, leg flow mediate dilation, handgrip, and plantar flexion exercise&#xD;
      tests.&#xD;
