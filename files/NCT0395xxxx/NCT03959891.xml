  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is looking to find out if the combination of Ipatasertib with Aromatase&#xD;
      inhibitor or Fulvestrant can be an effective treatment for breast cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational&#xD;
      drug and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug to use for&#xD;
      further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved ipatasertib as a treatment for&#xD;
      any disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA has approved fulvestrant, the aromatase inhibitors, and palbociclib as treatment&#xD;
      options for this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of ipatasertib in combination&#xD;
      with an aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant with or without palbociclib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resistance to standard of care treatment for people with your type of cancer is common.&#xD;
      Stopping (inhibiting) an enzyme called Akt in the cancer cells may overcome resistance to the&#xD;
      standard of care treatment. Ipatasertib is a type of inhibitor that is believed to work by&#xD;
      inhibiting Akt. Through the different combinations of ipatasertib and the standard of care&#xD;
      drugs, the chance of cancer cells becoming resistant to the standard of care drugs may&#xD;
      decrease, causing the cancer cells to stop growing and spreading.&#xD;

    <description>Letrozole is an aromatase inhibitor. This means it blocks the enzyme aromatase (found in the body's muscle, skin, breast and fat), which is used to convert androgens (hormones produced by the adrenal glands) into estrogen. In the absence of estrogen, tumors dependent on this hormone for growth will shrink.</description>

    <description>Palbociclib (Ibrance®) is a drug that can be used along with an aromatase inhibitor to treat women with advanced hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Palbociclib is a reversible small molecule cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor. The drug blocks proteins in the cell called cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 and CDK 6. In hormone positive breast cancer cells, blocking these proteins helps stop the cells from dividing to make new cells. It helps prevent the cells from moving from G1 to S cell cycle phase in the division process. This slows cancer growth.</description>

             drug-elimination half-lives, whichever is longer, prior to initiation of study&#xD;
             treatment. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important&#xD;
             to regularly consult a frequently-updated list such as&#xD;
             http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx; medical reference texts such as&#xD;
             the Physicians' Desk Reference may also provide this information. As part of the&#xD;
             enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of&#xD;
             interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be&#xD;
             prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal&#xD;
             product.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled inter-current illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements. Patient has impairment of gastrointestinal (GI) function or GI&#xD;
             disease that may significantly alter the absorption of the study drugs (e.g.,&#xD;
             inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative diseases, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting,&#xD;
             diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome, or small bowel resection).&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  On screening, inability to determine the QTcF interval on the ECG (i.e.:&#xD;
                  unreadable or not interpretable) or QTcF &gt;450 screening ECG (based on a mean of 3&#xD;
                  ECGs).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive participants on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible. These&#xD;
             participants are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with&#xD;
             marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in participants&#xD;
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;

             criteria for fasting blood glucose and hemoglobin A1c as outlined in the inclusion&#xD;
             criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the safety of study medications is&#xD;
             not established in pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of&#xD;
             becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception&#xD;
             throughout the study and for 8 weeks after study drug discontinuation. Women are&#xD;
             considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12&#xD;
             months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g.&#xD;
             age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral&#xD;
             oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago.&#xD;
             In the case of bilateral oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the&#xD;
             woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not&#xD;
             of child bearing potential. Highly effective contraception methods include:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the&#xD;
             patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation&#xD;
             methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without&#xD;
             hysterectomy), total hysterectomy, or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking&#xD;
             study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of&#xD;
             the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or placement of&#xD;
             an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS), or other forms of hormonal&#xD;
             contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%), for example hormone&#xD;
             vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In case of use of oral contraception, women should have been stable on the same pill&#xD;
             for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment. Note: While oral&#xD;
             contraceptives are allowed, they should be used in conjunction with a barrier method&#xD;
             of contraception due to unknown effect of drug-drug interaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For Arm A only: patients who have received prior fulvestrant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For Arm C only: h/o of intolerable toxicity to CDK 4/6 inhibitor resulting in&#xD;
             treatment discontinuation due to toxicity&#xD;
