  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The MAURITIUS trial is a single-arm, multicenter phase II study of single treatment with&#xD;
      midostaurin being applied to AML (acute myeloid leukemia) patients with activating FLT3&#xD;
      (FMS-like tyrosine kinase3) mutations and either molecular relapse or persistent molecular&#xD;
      positivity after allogeneic SCT. The leukemia-free survival (LFS), the achievement of &quot;MRD&#xD;
      low&quot; as well as the incidence of GvHD after transplantation reflect the most relevant&#xD;
      endpoints of this non-randomized clinical trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The clinical situation of AML (acute myeloid leukemia) relapse after intensive chemotherapy&#xD;
      or even after allogeneic SCT represents a huge challenge in hematology. So far, no FLT3-TKI&#xD;
      (Tyrosine kinase Inhibitor) has been approved for the treatment of relapsed or refractory AML&#xD;
      with activating FLT3 mutations in the European Union.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For elderly and unfit patients at primary diagnosis and for patients with AML relapse after&#xD;
      induction and consolidation chemotherapy (including those with allogeneic SCT) who are not&#xD;
      eligible for any further intensive treatment approach, AML therapy with HMA (hypomethylating&#xD;
      agents) represents the standard of care and is associated with an even worse prognosis in&#xD;
      those patients who relapse with AML after transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FLT3-TKI midostaurin has been approved for newly diagnosed AML patients with activating&#xD;
      FLT3 mutations who receive intensive induction and subsequent consolidation chemotherapy&#xD;
      including midostaurin maintenance restricted to patients who do not undergo allogeneic SCT.&#xD;
      So far, there is no approval of FLT3-TKI treatment for patients with FLT3-mutated AML after&#xD;
      allogeneic SCT. Recently, preliminary data of the RADIUS trial investigating midostaurin&#xD;
      maintenance after allogeneic SCT could demonstrate the feasibility of midostaurin treatment&#xD;
      in the setting of post-transplant AML patients. Importantly, only half of patients were able&#xD;
      to complete 12 cycles of maintenance and in most cases midostaurin was prematurely ceased due&#xD;
      to a higher rate of adverse events than expected. As a consequence of this clinical trial,&#xD;
      there is a good rationale to investigate midostaurin maintenance after allogeneic SCT&#xD;
      focusing on those AML patients with a high risk of hematologic relapse after transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In detail, MRD assessment provides a reliable method in the majority of patients with&#xD;
      FLT3-mutated AML (e.g. by qPCR) to identify AML patients with the highest risk of relapse&#xD;
      following allogeneic SCT. There are consistent data demonstrating that MRD positivity by&#xD;
      means of NPM1 (Nuclophosphmin-1)mutation (i.e. 100 to 1000 copies of mutated NPM1 per 10,000&#xD;
      ABL (Abelson Murine Leukemia Viral Oncogene Homolog) transcripts or 1% to 10% NPM1/ABL,&#xD;
      respectively, is associated with a 60-90% risk of hematologic relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, this clinically relevant subgroup of AML patients with activating FLT3 mutations who&#xD;
      develop a molecular relapse or who are characterized by a persistent MRD positivity after&#xD;
      intensive AML treatment represents the target population of this clinical trial. The&#xD;
      rationale of this study is to treat AML patients with MRD positivity using single midostaurin&#xD;
      treatment and to improve the clinical outcome of these patients by preventing hematologic&#xD;
      relapse after allogeneic SCT by &quot;targeted therapy&quot; against activating FLT3 mutations.&#xD;
