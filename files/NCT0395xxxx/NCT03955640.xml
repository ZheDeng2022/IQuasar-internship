      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of olaparib when given with&#xD;
      hyperthermia in treating patients with breast cancer that has come back in the chest wall.&#xD;
      Olaparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell&#xD;
      growth. Hyperthermia treatment may kill or damage tumor cells by heating them to several&#xD;
      degrees above normal body temperature. Giving olaparib and hyperthermia treatment may work&#xD;
      better in treating patients with breast cancer that has come back in the chest well compared&#xD;
      to standard of care.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the dose limiting toxicities and maximum tolerated dose of olaparib given in&#xD;
      combination with chest wall hyperthermia in patients with locally advanced or metastatic&#xD;
      breast cancer with chest wall recurrences who have wild-type BRCA status (patients with&#xD;
      germline BRCA mutations are excluded from this study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the local progression free survival (in months) for patients with chest wall&#xD;
      recurrences defined as time to progression of disease on chest wall with olaparib with&#xD;
      hyperthermia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the 1-year progression free survival (in months) for patients with chest&#xD;
      wall recurrences treated with olaparib with hyperthermia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the best local overall response rate of chest wall after the combination of&#xD;
      hyperthermia and olaparib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine the quality of life and pain scores before, during and after treatment as&#xD;
      measured by the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System which includes a pain score and 8 other&#xD;
      subjective measures of wellness for cancer patients (0 to 10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate BRCA1/2 levels by immunohistochemistry and explore if hyperthermia induced&#xD;
      BRCA1/2 expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate HR (homologous recombination) competency by RAD51 foci and explore if&#xD;
      hyperthermia induces homologous recombination in breast tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To explore deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage as measured by gammaH2AX and comet assay&#xD;
      in cells dissociated from biopsy tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of olaparib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive olaparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID). Treatment continues for 4 weeks in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression and unacceptable toxicity. Beginning week 2, patients also&#xD;
      undergo hyperthermia treatment over 1 hour twice weekly for 3 weeks in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression and unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 12 months.&#xD;
