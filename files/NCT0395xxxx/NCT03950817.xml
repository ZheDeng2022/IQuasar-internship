  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the situation when intravenous access is not readily available or unobtainable,&#xD;
      sub-dissociative dose ketamine can be administered via intranasal route (IN). The data&#xD;
      supporting intranasal route in pediatric patients is somewhat conflicting with regards to the&#xD;
      optimum intranasal dose (range 0.75-1 mg/kg) and frequencies of administration. Hence,&#xD;
      another non-invasive route such as nebulization via Breath-Actuated Nebulizer which allows a&#xD;
      controlled patient-initiated delivery of analgesics in titratable fashion might be considered&#xD;
      in the ED. Administration of fentanyl via BAN for pediatric patients presenting to the ED&#xD;
      with acute traumatic musculo-skeletal injuries was found to be safe and effective and&#xD;
      comparable to intravenous fentanyl and intravenous morphine. Nebulized administration of&#xD;
      ketamine however, has only been studied in the areas of acute postoperative pain management,&#xD;
      cancer palliation, and status asthmaticus therapy (ref). To our knowledge, there are no&#xD;
      prospective randomized trials that evaluated a role of nebulized SDK role in managing a&#xD;
      variety of acute and chronic painful conditions in the ED.&#xD;

      STUDY DESIGN Subjects: Pediatric patients aged 7-17 years presenting to the ED with acute&#xD;
      painful conditions such as traumatic and non-traumatic abdominal, flank, back,&#xD;
      musculoskeletal pain, vaso-occlusive painful crisis of sickle cell disease, and lacerations&#xD;
      with a pain score of 5 or more on a standard 11- point (0 to 10) numeric rating scale and&#xD;
      requiring sub-dissociative dose ketamine analgesia as determined by the treating attending&#xD;
      physician. Eligible patients will be identified by the primary evaluation of the treating&#xD;
      physician, who believes that the patient will benefit from the non-invasive route of Breath&#xD;
      Actuated Nebulized (BAN) Sub-Dissociative Dose Ketamine rather than other methods&#xD;
      (Intravenous, oral etc.) The treating physician will inform the research team of the&#xD;
      potential patient to begin the consenting and enrollment process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' screening and enrollment will be performed by study investigators and research&#xD;
      assistants. All patients will be enrolled at various times of the day when study&#xD;
      investigators will be available for patient enrollment and ED pharmacists will be available&#xD;
      for medication preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility Criteria: Patients with ages between 7 and 17 presenting to the ED with acute&#xD;
      painful conditions such as traumatic and non-traumatic abdominal, flank, back,&#xD;
      musculoskeletal pain, vaso-occlusive painful crisis of sickle cell disease, and lacerations&#xD;
      with a score of 5 or more on a standard 11- point (0 to 10) numeric rating scale. Patients&#xD;
      receiving oral acetaminophen and/or ibuprofen at triage prior to SDK administration will be&#xD;
      eligible for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria will include altered mental status, GCS&lt;15, allergy to ketamine, pregnant&#xD;
      patients, weight greater than 100 kg, heart rate &gt;180, airway abnormalities ( congenital or&#xD;
      acquired), absence of parent(s) at the time of consent, closed head injury, seizure disorder,&#xD;
      use of opioid analgesics, schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial comparing analgesic efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of nebulized SDK administered at three different doses to pediatric patients&#xD;
      presenting to the ED of Maimonides Medical Center with acute painful conditions. Upon meeting&#xD;
      the eligibility criteria, patients will be randomized into one of three study arms based on&#xD;
      the dosing of the SDK: 0.75 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, and 1.5 mg/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Procedures: Each patient will be approached by a study investigator for&#xD;
      acquisition of written informed consent and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability&#xD;
      Act authorization after being evaluated by the treating emergency physician and determined to&#xD;
      meet study eligibility criteria. When English will not be the participant's primary language,&#xD;
      a staff interpreter or licensed telephone interpreter would be used. Baseline pain score will&#xD;
      be determined with an 11-point numeric rating scale (0 to 10), described to the patient as&#xD;
      &quot;no pain&quot; being 0 and &quot;the worst pain imaginable&quot; being 10. A study investigator will record&#xD;
      the patient's body weight and baseline vital signs. The on-duty ED pharmacist will prepare a&#xD;
      breath-actuated nebulizer with doses of 0.75 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, and 1.5 mg/kg according to the&#xD;
      predetermined randomization list, which will be created in SPSS (version 24; IBM Corp,&#xD;
      Armonk, NY) with block randomization of every 10 participants. The medication will be&#xD;
      delivered to the treating nurse in a blinded fashion and will be administered via&#xD;
      breath-initiated nebulization for duration of treatment of 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study investigators will record pain scores, vital signs, and adverse effects at 15, 30, and&#xD;
      60 minutes. In addition, study investigators will record a residual amount of medication (ml)&#xD;
      in the nebulizer after the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients reported a pain numeric rating scale score of 5 or greater and requested&#xD;
      additional pain relief at 15 minutes mark post-ketamine administration, intravenous morphine&#xD;
      at 0.1 mg/kg will be administered as a rescue analgesic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be recorded on data collection sheets, including patients' sex, demographics,&#xD;
      medical history, and vital signs and entered into SPSS (version 24.0; IBM Corp) by the&#xD;
      research manager. Development of the randomization list, confirmation of written consent&#xD;
      acquisition for all participants, and statistical analyses will be conducted by the research&#xD;
      manager and statistician, who would work independent of any data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be closely monitored for any change in vital sings and for adverse effects&#xD;
      during the entire study period (up to 2 h) by study investigators. Common adverse effects&#xD;
      that are associated with sub-dissociative dose ketamine are felling of unreality, dizziness,&#xD;
      nausea, vomiting, and sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis: Data analyses will include frequency distributions, paired t-test to assess a&#xD;
      difference in pain scores within each group, and independent-sample t-test to assess&#xD;
      differences in pain scores between the 3 groups at the various intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mixed-model linear regression will be used to compare changes in pain numeric rating scale&#xD;
      across time points. This will compensate for participants lost to follow-up and allow all&#xD;
      patients' data to be analyzed on an intention-to-treat principle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For categorical outcomes (eg, complete resolution of pain), a X2 or Fisher's exact test will&#xD;
      be used to compare outcomes at 30 minutes. Percentage differences and 95% confidence&#xD;
      intervals between the treatment groups will be calculated for all time points with P&lt;.05 to&#xD;
      denote statistical significance. Based on the validation of a verbally administered rating&#xD;
      scale of acute pain in the ED and the comparison of verbal and visual pain scales, we will&#xD;
      use a primary outcome consisting of a minimal clinically meaningful difference of 1.3 between&#xD;
      three groups at the 30-minute pain assessment.28,29&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: Assuming an SD of 3.0, a power analysis determined that a repeated-measures&#xD;
      ANOVA with a sample size of 34 patients per group ( 102 total) will provide at least 80%&#xD;
      power to detect a difference of at least 1.3 at 30 minutes (as well as at any other interval&#xD;
      post-baseline), with an alpha=.05. To account for possible missing data the total sample size&#xD;
      will be 120 patients (40 per group).A pre-planned interim data analysis will occur upon&#xD;
      reaching a total of 60 patients ( 20) patients per group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Outcomes: The primary outcome will include a comparative reduction in pain scores on&#xD;
      numeric rating pain scale (NRS) between recipients of nebulized SDK given at three different&#xD;
      doses at 15 minutes after analgesic administration. The secondary outcomes will include a&#xD;
      need for rescue analgesia at 15, 30 or 60 minutes and adverse events in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With respect to unique adverse effects of SDK, we will use Side Effect Rating Scale for&#xD;
      Dissociative Anesthetics (SERSDA) and Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) (ref) SERSDA&#xD;
      Scale includes fatigue, dizziness, nausea, headache, feeling of unreality, changes in&#xD;
      hearing, mood change, general discomfort, and hallucinations with severity of each graded by&#xD;
      patients on a five-point scale, with &quot;0&quot; representing the absence of any adverse effects and&#xD;
      &quot;4&quot; representing a severely bothersome side effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RASS evaluates the severity of agitation and/or sedation in accordance to the nine-point&#xD;
      scale with scores ranging from &quot;-4&quot; (deeply sedated) to &quot;0&quot; (alert and calm) to &quot;+4&quot;&#xD;
      (combative).&#xD;
