  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study will investigate methods for enhancing cognitive training (CT) effects in&#xD;
      healthy older adults by employing a combination of interventions facilitating neural&#xD;
      plasticity and optimizing readiness for learning. Adults over the age of 65 represent the&#xD;
      fastest growing group in the US population. As such, age-related cognitive decline represents&#xD;
      a major concern for public health. Recent research suggests that cognitive training in older&#xD;
      adults can improve cognitive performance, with effects lasting up to 10 years. However, these&#xD;
      effects are typically limited to the tasks trained, with little transfer to other cognitive&#xD;
      abilities or everyday skills. A pilot randomized clinical trial will examine the individual&#xD;
      and combined impact of pairing cognitive training with an intermittent hypoxia (IH)&#xD;
      intervention. The investigators will compare changes in cognitive and brain function&#xD;
      resulting from CT combined with active IH versus CT combined with sham IH using a&#xD;
      comprehensive neurocognitive, clinical, and multimodal neuroimaging assessment of brain&#xD;
      structure, function, and metabolic state. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) will&#xD;
      be used to assess brain response during speed of processing; the active cognitive abilities&#xD;
      trained by CT. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) will assess cerebral metabolites,&#xD;
      including ATP and GABA concentrations sensitive to neural plasticity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Age-related cognitive decline has become a major public health concern. As the population&#xD;
      ages, the number of older adults experiencing cognitive and functional disturbances has&#xD;
      increased. There is currently a paucity of effective interventions to prevent or treat&#xD;
      cognitive decline or to enhance brain function in the elderly. The proposed study will&#xD;
      recruit a cohort from the state with the highest growth of older adults. The study team will&#xD;
      employ a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test whether the benefits of cognitive training&#xD;
      (CT) can be enhanced by a combined adjunctive intervention aimed at increasing neural&#xD;
      plasticity and optimizing readiness for learning: intermittent hypoxia (IH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current CT approaches have been shown to improve performance on trained tasks, with effects&#xD;
      lasting up to ten years. However, generalization of effects to other cognitive domains and&#xD;
      everyday functioning has been a problem in the past. There is now compelling evidence that&#xD;
      the elderly do experience functional improvements that persist long after initial training,&#xD;
      though peoples' ability to derive such benefits varies. Combined interventions have rarely&#xD;
      been examined and methods aimed at increasing neural plasticity and optimizing readiness for&#xD;
      learning are only now beginning to be explored. The proposed study will test one theoretical&#xD;
      approach for facilitating and optimizing CT effects on functional outcome. The investigators&#xD;
      will use an adjunctive physiological method to further stimulate task-related brain regions,&#xD;
      directly enhancing neural responsivity/plasticity and ultimately learning. While theoretical&#xD;
      rationales exist for each of these approaches, no studies to date have shown whether&#xD;
      adjunctive administration can optimize learning and functional status in the elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pilot randomized clinical trial will enroll 55 participants, with a target of 20&#xD;
      participants completing the study, and as many as 30 participants consenting but failing to&#xD;
      meet inclusion criteria at in person screening, and 5 participants withdrawing prior to&#xD;
      completion. Cognitively healthy elderly adults, age 65-89 will undergo either a CT&#xD;
      intervention in combination with IH or sham IH control. The CT intervention will employ the&#xD;
      Double Decision task from the POSIT Science Brain HQ; a well validated CT method for&#xD;
      enhancing cognitive functioning in the elderly. Participants will receive IH or sham/placebo&#xD;
      IH administered during training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be assessed at baseline and after CT (2 weeks). At each time point, a&#xD;
      comprehensive neurocognitive, clinical and multimodal neuroimaging assessment of brain&#xD;
      function, metabolic state, and brain structure will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FMRI will be used to assess brain response during working memory, attention and memory&#xD;
      encoding. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) will assess cerebral metabolites,&#xD;
      including gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) concentrations, sensitive to neural plasticity in&#xD;
      task-associated brain regions.&#xD;

    <description>Determine whether training performance improves when cognitive training (CT) is coupled with intermittent hypoxia (IH). Posit Science Double Decision is designed to improve the speed and accuracy with which the brain can process visual information, both at the center of gaze and on the periphery, known as &quot;useful field of view&quot; (UFOV). Scored in milliseconds, where lower scores indicate better processing speeds. CT will involve up to 10 hours of training over 2-weeks (10 days) and employs a PositScience BrainHQ suite via its researcher portal</description>

    <description>Acute intermittent hypoxia will be provided to the subject by delivering 15 brief exposures (~60 seconds) of hypoxic air alternated with 15 brief exposures (~60 seconds) of room air. The amount of oxygen delivered during hypoxic exposures may range from 15%-9% fraction of inspired oxygen, compared to 21% oxygen in normal atmospheric air. This is followed by a 30 minute rest period and then 60 minutes of computerized cognitive training.</description>
