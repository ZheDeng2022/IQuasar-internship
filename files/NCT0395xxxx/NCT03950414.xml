  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study measures the tolerability of viral-specific T cells against Cytomegalovirus (CMV)&#xD;
      in adult solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients. Participants are expected to be on study&#xD;
      for 52 +/- 3 weeks.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Viral infections, or their reactivation in the immunocompromised host, remain serious&#xD;
      complications that adversely affect outcomes of transplantation. These infections may be&#xD;
      refractory to pharmacologic treatment and result in increased morbidity and mortality after&#xD;
      transplantation. Furthermore, the available pharmacologic therapies can result in severe&#xD;
      toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once an infection occurs, adequate immune reconstitution is decisive for recovery from viral&#xD;
      disease after solid organ transplantation. The present trial will consist of the treatment of&#xD;
      solid organ transplant recipients diagnosed with severe CMV infection when standard antiviral&#xD;
      therapy is ineffective (disease progression on therapy, decline in viral load less than&#xD;
      10-fold in 2 weeks, known drug resistance), or toxic (end-organ damage), with virus-specific&#xD;
      T cells using the CliniMACS® Prodigy System. These are the patients with the greatest unmet&#xD;
      need and greatest risk or morbidity and allograft loss due to CMV infection. CMV-specific T&#xD;
      cells will be isolated from donor leukapheresis products using the CliniMACS® Prodigy. Prior&#xD;
      studies on transfer of CMV-specific T cells have been shown to be safe and efficacious in the&#xD;
      treatment of CMV infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this Phase I trial is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      CMV-specific T-cell transfer in adult patients suffering from CMV infections following solid&#xD;
      organ transplantation using a dose escalation design. The incubation with viral antigens&#xD;
      (MACS GMP PepTivator) allows the enrichment of CMV-specific CD4+(Cluster of Differentiation&#xD;
      4) and CD8+(Cluster of Differentiation 8) T cells. Increasing evidence of the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of CMV-specific T-cell is available. Furthermore, the safety and efficacy of the&#xD;
      specific manufacturing approach using the fully automated protocol of the ClinMACS® Prodigy&#xD;
      for the isolation of CMV-specific T cells against CMV has been described and demonstrated&#xD;
      that these cells retain their biological properties.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Donor selection priority: The original donor will be the first choice as the source of T&#xD;
        cells. If donation from the original organ donor is not possible (e.g., donor is&#xD;
        unavailable or ineligible), then an alternative related donor will be selected, with&#xD;
        preference for those who have full HLA matching in 6/6 loci over those with partial HLA&#xD;
        matching (≥ 2/6 HLA loci). See Appendix 1 for patient and donor screening procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. ≥ 18 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Available and capable of undergoing a single standard 2 blood volume leukapheresis or&#xD;
             donation of one unit of whole blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. If the original transplant donor is not eligible, then an eligible fully matched or&#xD;
             eligible partially matched family member will be used as the donor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Related donors must be at least partially HLA compatible, matching with recipient in&#xD;
             at least 2/6 HLA loci (HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-DRB1 will be considered for this).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Donors must be CMV IgG seropositive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Donors must show CMV T-cell activation after incubation with MACS GMP PepTivator&#xD;
             Peptide Pools of CMV pp65 before undergoing leukapheresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Donor must meet the criteria for donor selection defined in the UWHC Hematopoietic&#xD;
             Stem Cell Transplant Program SOP and FACT standards, which comply with 21 CFR 1271,&#xD;
             subpart C.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Donor must provide written informed consent.&#xD;
