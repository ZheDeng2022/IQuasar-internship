      Aim of this study is to asses post voiding residual volume by ultrasound scan 3th day after&#xD;
      delivery with consecutive scan after 6 weeks, and determination of data dispersion among the&#xD;
      population of primiparas. In women with excessive retention (+2SD), risk factors such as&#xD;
      duration of labour, use of epidural analgesia, instrumental delivery, maternal birth injury&#xD;
      and weight of the newborn will be noted down.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pregnancy itself and vaginal delivery are well known risk factors for pelvic floor&#xD;
      dysfunction. The rise in progesterone related to pregnancy has an inhibitory effect on&#xD;
      bladder smooth muscle - decreased smooth muscle tonus in lower urinary tract. Weight and&#xD;
      pressure of pregnant uterus and loosening of some of the pelvic ligaments changes the statics&#xD;
      of pelvic floor. In addition, delivery itself influence lower urinary tract; an&#xD;
      overdistension of urinary bladder can occur easily, also as oedema of urethra or urethral&#xD;
      hinge apparatus injury during &quot;crowning&quot; of the fetal head.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of these factors can affect consecutive function of lower urinary tract right after&#xD;
      delivery. It is known that in 1,5% of women giving birth, symptomatic urinary retention&#xD;
      develop in early postpartum period, with necessity of insertion of an indwelling catheter.&#xD;
      Discussed risk factors are: epidural analgesia, instrumental delivery and primiparity. The&#xD;
      investigators can assume that every woman in early postpartum period has (to some extend)&#xD;
      even in normal circumstances postvoiding residual volume. There is few evidence in a&#xD;
      literature about this postpartum residual volume and its predisposing factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postvoiding residual volume can be risk factor for postpartum urinary infection, which forms&#xD;
      second largest part in infectious morbidity of women. By determination of risk factors (for&#xD;
      increased post voiding residual volume) the investigators could narrow the group of women&#xD;
      which necessitate increased attention in postpartal monitoring.&#xD;
