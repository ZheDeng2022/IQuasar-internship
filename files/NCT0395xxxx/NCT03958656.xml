      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple myeloma is a blood cancer that is usually incurable. T cells are part of the immune&#xD;
      system. Researchers think changing a person's T cells to recognize their cancer could help&#xD;
      the person's body kill tumor cells. This is a new approach that uses a patient's own cells to&#xD;
      target multiple myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if giving anti-Signaling lymphocytic activation molecule F7 (SLAM7) chimeric antigen&#xD;
      receptor (CAR) T cells with a stop switch to people with multiple myeloma is safe and to see&#xD;
      if adding a gene to stop T-cell activity can limit toxicity of this therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18-73 with multiple myeloma for which prior standard treatment has not worked&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood, urine, and heart tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bone marrow samples: A needle inserted into the participant's bone will remove marrow.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Imaging scans: Participants will lie in a machine that takes pictures of the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have apheresis. They will receive a catheter or central line: A plastic&#xD;
      tube will be inserted into a chest or arm vein. Blood will be removed and the T cells&#xD;
      separated. The rest of the blood will be returned to the participant. The T cells will be&#xD;
      manipulated in the lab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get chemotherapy through the central line for 3 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive the manipulated T cells through the central line. They will stay in&#xD;
      the hospital at least 9 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have follow-up visits 2 weeks then 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, and 12 months after&#xD;
      the infusion. They will then have visits every 6 months for 3 years. Then they will be&#xD;
      contacted once per year for 15 years. All visits will include blood tests, and 3 visits will&#xD;
      include bone marrow biopsies....&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multiple myeloma (MM) is a nearly always incurable malignancy of plasma cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T cells can be genetically modified to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) that&#xD;
           target malignancy-associated antigens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Signaling lymphocytic activation molecule F7 (SLAM7) is highly and uniformly expressed&#xD;
           on MM cells but is absent on normal tissues except for some leukocytes, including a&#xD;
           subset of cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8)+ T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, B&#xD;
           cells, plasma cells and monocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We have constructed a novel anti-SLAMF7 CAR that can specifically recognize SLAMF7-&#xD;
           expressing target cells and eradicate SLAMF7-expressing tumors in mice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This protocol will test genetic modification of autologous T cells with genes encoding&#xD;
           an inducible caspase 9 (IC9) cell-suicide system plus the anti-SLAMF7 CAR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Administration of the dimerizer drug Rimiducid (AP1903) is necessary to activate the&#xD;
           inducible caspase 9 (IC9) suicide gene and eliminate CAR T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In this protocol, the suicide gene system will be used to eliminate CAR-expressing T&#xD;
           cells in case of severe toxicities caused by the CAR T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Possible toxicities include cytokine-associated toxicities such as hypotension, and&#xD;
           neurological toxicities. Elimination of NK cells and normal plasma cells could make&#xD;
           patients more susceptible to infections. Unknown toxicities are also possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Determine the safety, feasibility of administering T cells expressing an anti-SLAMF7 CAR&#xD;
      plus IC9 cell-suicide system to patients with MM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Greater than or equal to 18 years of age and less than or equal to age 73.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have measurable MM defined as a serum M-protein &gt;=0.6 g/dL or a urine&#xD;
           M-protein &gt;=200 mg/24 hours or an involved serum free light chain (FLC) level &gt;=10 mg/dL&#xD;
           (provided FLC ratio is abnormal) or a biopsy-proven plasmacytoma of 1.5 cm or more in&#xD;
           largest dimension, or greater than or equal to 30% bone marrow plasma cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have previously received at least 3 different treatment regimens for MM.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have prior exposure to an immunomodulatory drug (IMiD) such as&#xD;
           lenalidomide, and a proteasome inhibitor&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have a creatinine level of less than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have a cardiac ejection fraction &gt;= 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2 is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients on any anticoagulant medications except aspirin are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No active infections are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1000/microL, platelet count &gt;= 55,000/microL, hemoglobin &gt;=&#xD;
           8g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) less than or equal&#xD;
           to 2.5-fold higher than the upper limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At least 14 days must elapse between the time of any prior systemic treatment (including&#xD;
           corticosteroids) and the required leukapheresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At least 14 days must elapse between the time of any prior systemic treatment and&#xD;
           initiation of protocol treatment. Systemic therapy includes corticosteroids at a dose&#xD;
           equivalent to more than 5 mg of prednisone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bone marrow plasma cells must make up less than or equal to 50% of total bone marrow&#xD;
           cells less than or equal to 24 days prior to the start of protocol treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient's MM will need to be assessed for SLAMF7 expression by flow cytometry or&#xD;
           immunohistochemistry performed at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The myeloma&#xD;
           must express SLAMF7. If unstained, paraffin-embedded bone marrow or plasmacytoma&#xD;
           sections are available from prior biopsies, these can be used to determine SLAMF7&#xD;
           expression by immunohistochemistry; otherwise patients will need to come to the NIH for&#xD;
           a bone marrow biopsy or other biopsy of a plasmacytoma to determine SLAMF7 expression.&#xD;
           The sample for SLAMF7 expression can come from a biopsy obtained at any time before&#xD;
           enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a phase I dose-escalation trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will undergo leukapheresis, and T cells will be modified to express the&#xD;
           IC9-anti-SLAMF7 CAR construct.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The chemotherapy conditioning regimen is cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m^2 daily for 3 days&#xD;
           and fludarabine 30 mg/m^2 daily for 3 days. The intent of chemotherapy is to enhance CAR&#xD;
           T-cell activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the chemotherapy ends, the patients will have two days with no treatments and then&#xD;
           receive an infusion of CAR T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The initial dose level will be 0.66x10^6 Anti-SLAMF7-CAR + T cells/kg of recipient&#xD;
           bodyweight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The cell dose administered will be escalated for up to 4 doses until a maximum tolerated&#xD;
           dose is determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Following the T-cell infusion, there will be a mandatory 9-day minimum inpatient&#xD;
           hospitalization to monitor for toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Outpatient follow-up is planned for 2 weeks, and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, and 12 months after&#xD;
           the CAR T-cell infusion. Afterwards, follow-up will be every six months up to at least 3&#xD;
           years after infusion.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA - MULTIPLE MYELOMA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signaling lymphocytic activation molecule F7 (SLAMF7) expression must be detected on&#xD;
             malignant plasma cells from either bone marrow or a plasmacytoma by flow cytometry or&#xD;
             immunohistochemistry. A specific quantitative level of SLAMF7 expression for&#xD;
             eligibility is not specified, but patients with multiple myeloma cells that are&#xD;
             negative for SLAMF7 by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry will not be enrolled.&#xD;
             These assays must be performed at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). It is not&#xD;
             required that the specimen used for SLAMF7 determination comes from a sample that was&#xD;
             obtained after the patient's most recent treatment. If paraffin embedded unstained&#xD;
             samples of bone marrow involved with MM or a plasmacytoma are available, these can be&#xD;
             shipped to the NIH for SLAMF7 staining, otherwise new biopsies will need to be&#xD;
             performed for determination of SLAMF7 expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  SLAMF7 expression will need to be documented on the majority of malignant plasma cells&#xD;
             by flow cytometry at the NIH at some time after the original chimeric antigen receptor&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Bone marrow core biopsy with 30% or more plasma cells&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION CRITERIA - OTHER:&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients of both sexes must be willing to practice birth control from the time of&#xD;
             enrollment on this study and for four months after last day of receiving protocol&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Seronegative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody. (The experimental&#xD;
             treatment being evaluated in this protocol depends on an intact immune system.&#xD;
             Patients who are HIV seropositive can have decreased immune-competence and thus are&#xD;
             less responsive to the experimental treatment and more susceptible to its toxicities.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A patient with a negative blood polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for hepatitis B&#xD;
             deoxyribonucleic (DNA) test can be enrolled. If hepatitis B DNA (PCR) testing is not&#xD;
             available, patients with a negative hepatitis B surface antigen and negative hepatitis&#xD;
             B core antibody can be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be tested for the presence of Hepatitis C antigen by PCR and be&#xD;
             hepatitis C virus (HCV) ribonucleic acid (RNA) negative in order to be eligible. Only&#xD;
             if Hepatitis C PCR testing is not available in a timely manner, patients who are&#xD;
             Hepatitis C antibody-negative can be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1000/mm^3 without the support of&#xD;
             filgrastim or other growth factors within the previous 10 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelet count greater than or equal to 55,000/mm^3 without transfusion support in the&#xD;
             past 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 8.0 g/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Less than 5% plasma cells in the peripheral blood leukocytes&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) less or&#xD;
             equal to 2.5 times the upper limit of the institutional normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total bilirubin less than or equal to 2.0 mg/dL, except in patients with Gilbert's&#xD;
             Syndrome who must have a total bilirubin less than 3.0 mg/dL.&#xD;

          -  At least 14 days must have elapsed since any prior systemic therapy at the time the&#xD;
             patient starts the cyclophosphamide and fludarabine conditioning regimen, and patients&#xD;
             toxicities must have recovered to a grade 1 or less (except for toxicities such as&#xD;
             alopecia or vitiligo or cytopenias).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because this protocol requires collection of autologous blood cells by leukapheresis&#xD;
             in order to prepare CAR-SLAMF7 T cells, systemic anti-myeloma therapy including&#xD;
             systemic corticosteroid steroid therapy of greater than 5 mg/day of prednisone or&#xD;
             equivalent dose of another corticosteroid are not allowed within 14 days prior to the&#xD;
             required leukapheresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Normal cardiac ejection fraction (greater than or equal to 50% by echocardiography)&#xD;
             and no evidence of hemodynamically significant pericardial effusion as determined by&#xD;
             an echocardiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For patients with past participation in gene-therapy, cryopreserved peripheral blood&#xD;
             mononuclear cells (PBMC) that have not been genetically engineered must be available.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving prior gene therapy outside of NIH will not be eligible. Patients&#xD;
             who previously received CAR T-cell therapy at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) will&#xD;
             be potentially eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients on any anticoagulants except aspirin&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients that require urgent therapy due to tumor mass effects or spinal cord&#xD;
             compression.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients that have active hemolytic anemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with second malignancies in addition to multiple myeloma are not eligible if&#xD;
             the second malignancy has required treatment within the past 3 years or is not in&#xD;
             complete remission. There are two exceptions to this criterion: successfully treated&#xD;
             non-metastatic basal cell or squamous cell skin carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential who are pregnant or breastfeeding because of the&#xD;
             potentially dangerous effects of the preparative chemotherapy on the fetus or infant.&#xD;
             Women of child bearing potential cannot have a positive pregnancy test. Women of&#xD;
             childbearing potential are defined as all women except women who are post-menopausal&#xD;
             or who have had a hysterectomy. Postmenopausal will be defined as women over the age&#xD;
             of 55 who have not had a menstrual period in at least 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active systemic infections (defined as infections causing fevers or requiring&#xD;
             anti-microbial treatment), active coagulation disorders or other major uncontrolled&#xD;
             illnesses of the cardiovascular, respiratory, endocrine, renal, gastrointestinal,&#xD;
             genitourinary, neurologic, psychiatric, or immune system, history of myocardial&#xD;
             infarction, active cardiac arrhythmias, active obstructive or restrictive pulmonary&#xD;
             disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any form of primary immunodeficiency (such as Severe Combined Immunodeficiency&#xD;
             Disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Systemic corticosteroid steroid therapy of greater than 5 mg/day of prednisone or&#xD;
             equivalent dose of another corticosteroid (prednisone, dexamethasone, etc.) is not&#xD;
             allowed within 14 days prior to either the required leukapheresis or within 14 days&#xD;
             prior to CAR Tcell infusion (and at any time after the CAR T-cell infusion unless&#xD;
             approved by the Principal Investigator or an Associate Investigator).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of severe immediate hypersensitivity reaction to any of the agents used in&#xD;
             this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient unwilling to undergo intensive care unit treatment including mechanical&#xD;
             ventilation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, vasoactive drugs, and hemodialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allogeneic stem cell transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with current spinal cord compression (without intradural myeloma involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have a history (or current evidence) of cerebrospinal fluid multiple&#xD;
             myeloma, or intradural central nervous system masses.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with active autoimmune skin diseases such as psoriasis or other active&#xD;
             autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have required supplemental oxygen within the past month unless it&#xD;
             was for a resolved infection.&#xD;

A serious adverse event is an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that results in death, a life-threatening adverse drug experience, hospitalization, disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, congenital anomaly/birth defect or important medical events that jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the previous outcomes mentioned.</description>

        <description>Response was assessed by the International Uniform Response Criteria for Multiple myeloma 2016 updated version. Complete Remission (CR) is negative immunofixation on the serum and urine, and disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas. Very Good Partial Remission (VGPR) is serum and urine M-protein detectable by immunofixation but not on electrophoresis, or 90% or greater reduction in serum M-protein plus urine M-protein level &lt;100mg per 24 h. Partial Remission (PR) is 50% or greater reduction of serum M-protein and 90% or greater reduction in 24-h urinary M-protein (or to less than 200mg per 24 h). Progressive Disease (PD) is serum M-component (minimum absolute increase of 0.5g/dL), or urine M-component (minimum absolute increase of 200mg/24h). Stable Disease (SD) is not meeting criteria for CR, VGPR, PR or progressive disease.</description>
