  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators want to verify the hypothesis that targeting the calcium-activated (KCa3.1)&#xD;
      and the voltage-dependent K channel (Kv1.3) could be a valuable therapeutic strategy to&#xD;
      reprogram cells of the innate immune system, with the aim to fight glioma, a deadly CNS&#xD;
      tumor. The investigators will use murine models of glioma, injecting GL261 cells in the brain&#xD;
      of syngeneic C57BL6 mice, to study the effect of K channel inhibition on the activation of&#xD;
      microglia (M), macrophages (Mf) and NK cells. The investigators will use M and vesicles&#xD;
      released from these cells, re-educated toward an anti-tumor phenotype, to interfere with the&#xD;
      vicious circle responsible of uncontrolled tumor growth and will study the role of NK cells&#xD;
      in tumor-M/Mf communication. The investigators will also investigate how K channels interfere&#xD;
      with the communication of innate immune cells and brain cells like neurons and astrocytes,&#xD;
      with experiments focused on synaptic transmission and calcium imaging, investigating the&#xD;
      effect of modulation of the tumor microenvironment.&#xD;

      Specific Aim 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate whether M, or Mf-derived micro-vesicles, delivered to the brain of mouse&#xD;
      bearing glioma could affect glioma growth and mice survival. This will allow to better define&#xD;
      the role of M in controlling glioma growth as a function of its activation state and of&#xD;
      KCa3.1 and Kv1.3 channel expression and activity. OBJECTIVE: from this aim the investigators&#xD;
      expect to verify whether brain delivery of differently polarized M (or M-derived vesicles),&#xD;
      or M/Mf, could represent a meaningful approach to counteract glioma growth and to lengthen&#xD;
      mice survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigate the relationship between CD11b+ and NK cells upon KCa3.1 and Kv1.3 inhibition or&#xD;
      NK cell depletion. OBJECTIVE: data obtained will help to understand whether the activation&#xD;
      state of M/Mf affects NK cell accumulation in the tumor site and their cytotoxic activity,&#xD;
      whether NK cells modulate M/Mf activation, with effects on tumor growth, and the eventual&#xD;
      role played by K+ channels. Our preliminary data showing that TRAM-34 treatment increased the&#xD;
      mRNA level of IL-15 in the brain of glioma-bearing mice (FIG3) would suggest an&#xD;
      IL-15-mediated increased accumulation of NK cells in the tumor region, similarly to previous&#xD;
      evidence (19).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the roles of KCa3.1 and Kv1.3 channels in the interaction between glioma and&#xD;
      the surrounding parenchyma. OBJECTIVE: to identify possible mechanisms of altered&#xD;
      communication in the brain of mice treated with K+ channel inhibitors by studying K+&#xD;
      currents, excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission and astrocytes activation state,&#xD;
      under normal and hypoxic conditions (corresponding to different position in the tumor mass).&#xD;
      Altered expression and function of ion channels in glioma cells isolated from mice treated&#xD;
      with functionally different M and M-derived vesicles will also be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Design Aim 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Design Aim 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Design Aim 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be investigated with M polarized in culture, treated with TRAM-34 or PAP-1,&#xD;
      silenced by siRNA specific for KCa3.1 (9) or isolated from KCa3.1-/- or Kv1.3 -/- mice and&#xD;
      transplanted in the brain of glioma bearing mice by brain injection or intranasal delivery.&#xD;
      Brain injection of M will be performed similarly to glioma injection (21). Intranasal (i.n.)&#xD;
      cell application will be performed during a short isoflurane anesthesia. Before treatment,&#xD;
      all animals will receive 100 U hyaluronidase i.n. dissolved in 12 µL of sterile PBS and one&#xD;
      hour later a microglia suspension (3 × 105 in 12 µL of sterile PBS) or vehicle (PBS) will be&#xD;
      applied using the same procedure. Microglia application will be repeated every 3 days until&#xD;
      mice sacrifice. To check for M delivery in brain tumor region, control experiments will be&#xD;
      performed using GFP-labeled M, obtained from sibling CX3CR1GFP/+ mice, already available in&#xD;
      our laboratory. To prepare micro-vesicles, M will be treated with ATP (1mM) for 30 min (20).&#xD;
      Different centrifugation steps will be performed and the homogeneity of vesicle dimension&#xD;
      will be evaluated in parallel experiments by dynamic light scattering. Fixed volumes of this&#xD;
      preparation (4microL) will be administrated intra nasally every 3 days until mice sacrifice.&#xD;
      M and Mf-derived micro-vesicle-transplanted mice will then be analyzed for tumor volume and&#xD;
      mice survival investigated as described (9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be performed on cells isolated (by human biopsy and mice brain) by FACS sorting or&#xD;
      by magnetic separator (CD11b+ cells), and assayed in vitro for phagocytic and cytotoxic&#xD;
      activity. The investigators will also perform analysis of gene expression and&#xD;
      electrophysiological recordings (patch clamp) of ion channel function on M and on tumor cells&#xD;
      in vitro and ex vivo in brain slices. These experiments will be performed in TRAM-34 or PAP-1&#xD;
      treated or in KCa3.1-/- or KV1.3-/- glioma bearing mice. M/Mf-NK cell interaction will be&#xD;
      also studied looking at NK-induced M/Mf alteration and M/Mf-induced NK alteration. At this&#xD;
      aim the investigators will deplete NK cell population with repeated injection of anti NK1.1&#xD;
      antibody in glioma bearing mice, to analyze the activation state of M/Mf cell population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this aim the investigators will use electrophysiological, fluorescence and confocal&#xD;
      microscope analysis in acute brain slice preparations. A detailed description of the&#xD;
      functional role of microglial K+ channels in modulating glioma progression will be provided.&#xD;
      In particular, the functional properties of KCa3.1 and Kv1.3 channels expressed by microglial&#xD;
      cells in control and glioma injected mice will be evaluated in acute brain slices by means of&#xD;
      the patch-clamp techniques. The effects of K channel blockade on neuronal signaling and on&#xD;
      astrocytes reactivity will be also evaluated in the same conditions. Fluorescence-based&#xD;
      digital Ca2+ imaging will be used to assess the role of these channels in microglial [Ca2+]i&#xD;
      regulation. Using electrophysiological measurements, in combination with immunochemical, PCR,&#xD;
      siRNA analysis, the investigators will also analyze the modulation of K channels in glioma.&#xD;
      Using acute brain slices from glioma-injected mice, the investigators will also assess&#xD;
      whether treatment of mice with polarized M affects the expression and function of glioma ion&#xD;
      channels known to contribute to the transformed phenotype, such as KCa3.1 channels, BK&#xD;
      channels, and volume-activated Cl channels. These experiments will be performed in hypoxic&#xD;
      and non-hypoxic areas of the tumor, identified ex post by evaluating the HIF-1alfa&#xD;
      expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodologies and statistical analyses: The iterative method of &quot;Camussi et al.&quot; (20) will be&#xD;
      followed. The investigators will use the following relation where n is the number of animals:&#xD;
      n&gt;2sigma^2 (z alpha/D)^2. As an example, to estimate the number of mice necessary to obtain a&#xD;
      significance alpha=0.09, a difference D in treatment effect on a given parameter, the&#xD;
      investigators need to know the standard deviation sigma. Since sigma^2 is unknown, it must be&#xD;
      substituted with an estimate of sampling variance s^2. If the investigators give to s^2=0.01,&#xD;
      the investigators have that n&gt;18, so the investigators predict to use 20 mice per&#xD;
      experimental group. Our experience with mice suggests that it is a reasonable number.&#xD;
      Statistical significance will be assessed by one-way ANOVA for parametrical data, as&#xD;
      indicated; &quot;Holm-Sidak&quot; test will be used as post-hoc test; &quot;Mann and Withney&quot; test for&#xD;
      non-parametrical data. Where appropriate, Student's t-test or analysis of variance (ANOVA)&#xD;
      will be used.&#xD;
