  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension is a common condition that can cause serious events such as stroke, coronary&#xD;
      heart disease and heart failure. Homocysteine (Hcy) is a substance in the body that is&#xD;
      harmful to blood vessels. Hyperhomocysteinemia (plasma Hcyâ‰¥10 mol/L), which is associated&#xD;
      with hypertension, significantly increases the risk of stroke. This type of high blood&#xD;
      pressure is called type &quot;H&quot; hypertension. Enalapril folic acid tablet is an innovative drug&#xD;
      developed independently in China and is the first choice for the treatment of H type&#xD;
      hypertension. Patients with type H hypertension should be treated with enalapril folic acid&#xD;
      tablets to reduce stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, some patients had poor blood pressure control after monotherapy. At this time, other&#xD;
      antihypertensive drugs should be used in combination. Amlodipine and Hydrochlorothiazide are&#xD;
      the most commonly used and the best combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study was to observe the difference in the efficacy of enalapril folic&#xD;
      acid tablets in patients with uncontrolled blood pressure who were well tolerated and&#xD;
      randomized to aminoclodipine or hydrochlorothiazide in reducing stroke and other&#xD;
      cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, and to explore the relationship between various&#xD;
      alternative measures and efficacy.&#xD;
