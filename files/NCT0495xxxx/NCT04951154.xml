  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess spontaneous changes in pathological response in the&#xD;
      surgically resected tumor (Non-small cell lung cancer [NSCLC]).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter study including participants with a radiographically identified lung&#xD;
      lesion that is highly suspicious for lung cancer that has been deemed likely to be&#xD;
      resectable. After confirmation of a NSCLC diagnosis and eligibility for surgical resection&#xD;
      with curative intent, participants will undergo surgical resection of their tumor.&#xD;
      Participants will complete a follow up visit approximately 12 weeks (+- 4 weeks) after their&#xD;
      surgery. During this initial period of the study, blood and tissue samples will be collected&#xD;
      for biomarker analyses. Participants will then receive a follow up telephone call every 6&#xD;
      months for up to an additional 2 years to document any instances of disease recurrence.&#xD;
      Therefore, a key objective of this Phase 0 study is to achieve a more detailed understanding&#xD;
      of how representative these pretreatment bronchoscopic biopsies are of the resected tumor&#xD;
      sample, hence, no investigational new treatments will be given to the participants enrolled&#xD;
      in this Phase 0 study. Safety will be evaluated by monitoring of procedure-related adverse&#xD;
      events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs). The total duration of the study will be&#xD;
      approximately 2 years and 4 months (actual duration of participation will be dependent upon&#xD;
      timing of scheduling of bronchoscopy and surgical resection and timing of cancer recurrence,&#xD;
      if applicable).&#xD;

Participants will then be followed clinically for two years for evidence of recurrence.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Presence of one or more radiographically identified 1-5 centimeter (cm) solid or&#xD;

             cancer and requiring bronchoscopic diagnosis, with a computed tomography (CT) scan or&#xD;
             other cross-sectional imaging (example, CT-positron emission tomography [PET]) within&#xD;
