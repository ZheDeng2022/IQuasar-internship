  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thirty-two participants with ACL rupture were included in the study. All participants were&#xD;
      divided in two groups - control and experimental. In the experimental group (n=16)&#xD;
      participants received 4 weeks standardized physiotherapy and Kinesio tape, in the control&#xD;
      group - standardized physiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental measurements: Anthropometric measurements, pain intensity, static and dynamic&#xD;
      balance, proprioception, knee flexion and extension muscle torque, level of activity&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Static and dynamic balance</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Static and dynamic balance were measured by posturography method with a single piezoelectric force plate (KISTLER, Switzerland, Slimline System 9286) was used to measure postural sway activity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Muscle torque</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The isometric and concentric torque of the knee extensor and flexor muscles of the non-injured and injured legs was measured using an isokinetic dynamometer (System 3; Biodex Medical Systems, Shirley, New York).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Joint position sense test</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Joint position sense test was used to measure proprioceptive accuracy. Joint position sense for both legs was assessed for all subjects using the Biodex System Isokinetic Dynamometer 3 (Biodex Medical System Inc., Shirley, NY, USA).Subjects actively extended the knee from the resting position (90째flexion) to one of two test positions: 80째 or 40째 flexion at 0,5째/s velocity. Subjects were instructed to actively reproduce this criterion angle and to stop knee motion, via a thumb switch. No feedback was provided.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Lysholm scale</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Lysholm scale does measure the domains of symptoms and complaints and does measure functioning in daily activities</description>

    <measure>The Tegner scale</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Tegner scale measure the subjective functional activity</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>VAS scale</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The severity of pain was determined based on a numerical pain scale in which 0 symbolizes 'no pain' and 10 symbolizes 'maximum pain'</description>

    <description>The standardized physiotherapy program was designed on the basis of S. van Grinsven et al.'s (2010) rehabilitation protocol - was applied 4 weeks, 3 times per week, the duration of the procedure was 60 minutes. The Kinesio tape (KT) technique was chosen on the basis of K. Kase et al.'s (2003) recommendations. KT (Japan) was applied to the injured leg using muscular and functional-corrective techniques on the quadriceps femoris and the hamstring muscle. There were 6 KT procedures per participant in the experimental group. The CON group received KT only during the baseline and final assessment to assess short-term effect of KT.</description>
