  <detailed_description>

      To evaluate the effect of a series of optimization measures in ERAS among the patients during&#xD;
      perioperative period who underwent cervical surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A retrospective cohort study was conducted for the patients who underwent cervical spine&#xD;
      surgery in a top three hospital in Beijing from April to December 2018. According to whether&#xD;
      to implement enhanced recovery surgery, the patients were divided into enhanced recovery&#xD;
      surgery group (eras group) and control group. The self-designed data collection table was&#xD;
      used to collect data in the patient's medical records, including general demographic data and&#xD;
      disease treatment data, implementation of accelerated rehabilitation surgery and application&#xD;
      effect. Among them, the application effect includes the operation related complications, the&#xD;
      visual analog scale (VAS) score of neck and shoulder pain, the ability of daily living after&#xD;
      discharge, the length of stay, the cost of hospitalization and other recent rehabilitation&#xD;
      effect indicators, as well as the rehospitalization rate of 90 days and the Japanese&#xD;
      Orthopaedic Society four months after operation Association (JOA) score, neck disability&#xD;
      index (NDI) score, neck and shoulder pain symptoms, neck and shoulder stiffness symptoms and&#xD;
      other long-term rehabilitation indicators. Independent sample t-test, rank sum test and chi&#xD;
      square test were used to compare the differences between the two groups. On the basis of&#xD;
      single factor analysis, combined with multi factor analysis, the impact of groups on outcome&#xD;
      indicators was clarified, included 90-day readmission, reexamination time, follow-up JOA&#xD;
      score, NDI score, neck and shoulder pain symptoms and neck and shoulder stiffness symptoms.&#xD;
