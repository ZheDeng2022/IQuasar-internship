  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective, blinded, multicenter study for the InferRead CT Pneumonia.AI. The&#xD;
      primary endpoint will evaluate the software's performance in identifying non-contrast chest&#xD;
      CT scans containing pneumonia. It will evaluate InferRead CT Pneumonia.AI in terms of&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity with respect to a ground truth, as established by trained&#xD;
      thoracic radiologists, in the detection of penumonia. In addition, the study will compare&#xD;
      time to notification for the InferRead CT Pneumonia.AI software with respect to the time to&#xD;
      notification for the standard of care as established from available radiological reports.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the performance of InferRead CT Pneumonia.AI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the effect of different factors such as CT manufacturer, CT scanning&#xD;
           protocols and patient characteristics on the performance of InferRead CT Pneumonia.AI&#xD;

    <description>InferRead CT Pneumonia.AI reads chest CT DICOM images from medical imaging storage devices and triages cases by detecting pneumonia lesions and then flagging suspected cases in the study list. InferRead CT Pneumonia.AI is a tool to assist clinicians and it does not replace the interpretation and diagnosis by clinicians.</description>

        This retrospective study will be used to assess the performance of the subject device. The&#xD;
        principal investigator will collect DICOM data and relevant clinical information based on&#xD;
        the selection criteria. DICOM will be de-identified of PHI and stored in a secure location.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The validation dataset will contain non-contrast chest CT scans from patients in the United&#xD;
        States that are either negative or have confirmed pneumonia (viral or bacterial). Data will&#xD;
        come from at least 3 hospitals and cover a variety of data attributes.&#xD;
