    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of Xultophy® initiated&#xD;
      according to label in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) under routine clinical&#xD;
      practice conditions. Participants will get Xultophy® as prescribed to them by the study&#xD;
      doctor. The study will last for about 26 weeks.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Xultophy® (insulin degludec/liraglutide)</intervention_name>
    <description>Xultophy® is a fixed ratio combination of the long-acting basal insulin, insulin degludec, and the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA), liraglutide, administered under the skin.&#xD;
Patients will be treated according to routine clinical practice at the discretion of the treating physician according to the label approved by MFDS.&#xD;
The assignment of the patient to Xultophy® is not decided in advance by the protocol but falls within current practice and the prescription of Xultophy® is clearly separated from the decision to include the patient in the study.</description>
