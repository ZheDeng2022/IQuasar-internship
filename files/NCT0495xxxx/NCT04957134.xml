  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Electro-acupuncture provides stimulation to acupoints, and has been widely used to treat&#xD;
      abdominal obesity in China despite of lack of high-level evidence for treatment efficacy. The&#xD;
      study will investigate whether the electroacupuncture can alleviate clinical symptoms and the&#xD;
      mechanism of action in patients with abdominal obesity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a randomized controlled trial from May 2021 to December 2022, including 68&#xD;
      participants with abdominal obesity. The participants will be randomly divided into 2 groups&#xD;
      in a 1:1 allocation ratio.The intervention group will receive electroacupuncture combined&#xD;
      with lifestyle intervention; the control group will receive sham acupuncture combined with&#xD;
      lifestyle intervention. Each treatment will last 12 weeks, including 8 weeks of intervention&#xD;
      period and 4 weeks of follow-up. The primary outcome is the waist circumference (WC), the&#xD;
      secondary outcomes include weight, body mass index (BMI), hipline, waist-hip-ratio (WHR),&#xD;
      Insulin resistance index (IRI), blood fat, metabolomics will be used analysis the mechanism&#xD;
      compared with health volunteer. The adverse events will be recorded during the intervention&#xD;
      and follow-up period.&#xD;
