  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obliterative arterial disease of the lower limbs affects 200 million people worldwide,&#xD;
      including approximately 40 million in Europe. This disease is associated with a significant&#xD;
      increase in morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common clinical symptomatology is difficulty walking (intermittent claudication).&#xD;
      Less frequent but more severe, critical ischemia includes rest pain requiring analgesics, and&#xD;
      trophic disorders (ulcers, gangrene), which may lead to amputation. The Rutherford&#xD;
      classification groups the different clinical forms of this pathology. The classic risk&#xD;
      factors of cardiovascular pathologies, such as age, smoking, hypertension, diabetes and&#xD;
      hypercholesterolemia, are closely linked to Obliterative arterial disease of the lower limbs.&#xD;
      Over the past 20 years, the interventional management of this condition has undergone a&#xD;
      paradigm shift. The rise of endovascular surgery has broadened the range of therapeutic&#xD;
      possibilities, while reducing the impact on patients. Advances in equipment and imaging&#xD;
      quality have made it possible to treat increasingly complex lesions, allowing this type of&#xD;
      technique to be offered to patients initially treated with conventional surgery&#xD;
      (Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) C and D). Unfortunately, for long&#xD;
      recanalizations and calcified lesions, the crossing of the lesion and its re-entry into the&#xD;
      true arterial lumen is a failure in 25% of cases. It is with this in mind that retrograde&#xD;
      puncture and the associated SAFARI (Subintimal Arterial Flossing with Anterograde-retrograde&#xD;
      Intervention) technique were developed. In case of failure to cross the lesion by&#xD;
      anterograde, intraluminal or subintimal, a retrograde puncture downstream, echo or radio&#xD;
      guided, is performed. The vessels most often punctured are the popliteal artery or the leg&#xD;
      axes. Recanalization of the lesion is done by retrograde approach. The guidewire introduced&#xD;
      distally is recovered in the introducer through which the first recanalization attempt was&#xD;
      made. The procedure is then performed in the classical way using the anterograde approach. At&#xD;
      the end of the procedure, hemostasis of the puncture site is obtained by prolonged inflation&#xD;
      of a balloon or the placement of a covered stent. Initially reserved for critically ischemic&#xD;
      patients (Rutherford 4-6), this technique tends to be extended to claudicant patients&#xD;
      (Rutherford 2-3). Zhuang et al have recently demonstrated the efficacy and safety of this&#xD;
      technique in a large cohort of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In parallel with the evolution of revascularization techniques, the evolution of care&#xD;
      pathways has given ambulatory care a prominent place. Since January 2020, in the vascular&#xD;
      surgery department of GHPSJ, peripheral angioplasties are mostly performed on an outpatient&#xD;
      basis. The patients treated are classified as Rutherford 2 to 5 in most cases. No adverse&#xD;
      events related to this management have been reported. To date, no study evaluating the&#xD;
      feasibility and safety of retrograde punctures in the outpatient setting has been performed.&#xD;
