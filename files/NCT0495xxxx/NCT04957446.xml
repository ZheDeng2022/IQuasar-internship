  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study device, Sculptra, is an injectable implant formulation of poly-L-lactic acid&#xD;
      microbeads, approved by the FDA for treatment of facial fat loss (lipoatrophy of HIV&#xD;
      disease). It is being used off-label by dermatologists to treat dermal defects, as a&#xD;
      biologically active filler. Anecdotal evidence suggests that subjects' skin quality may&#xD;
      improve as a result of poly-L-lactic acid injection. While this is not the primary goal of&#xD;
      such treatments it is often seen and described as so called &quot;Sculptra glow&quot;. Based upon the&#xD;
      study doctor's experience global skin quality improvement includes radiance, smoothness and&#xD;
      pigment uniformity as well as a decrease in skin redness and pore size. In this study we&#xD;
      evaluate the existence of histopathological (microscopic examination of tissue) evidence that&#xD;
      can explain the observed improvement of skin quality after poly-L-lactic acid injections.&#xD;
      Specifically, we will use histopathologic techniques to investigate effects of Sculptra&#xD;
      injections into human skin with regard to restoring skin health and epidermal thickness.&#xD;

      Sculptra is a formulation of poly-L-lactic acid microbeads, approved by the FDA for treatment&#xD;
      of facial fat loss (lipoatrophy of HIV disease). It is being used off-label by dermatologists&#xD;
      to treat dermal defects, as a biologically active filler. Anecdotal evidence suggests that&#xD;
      patients' skin quality may improve as a result of poly-L-lactic acid injection. While this is&#xD;
      not the primary goal of such treatments it is often seen and described as so called &quot;Sculptra&#xD;
      glow&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based upon the investigator's experience global skin quality improvement includes radiance,&#xD;
      smoothness and pigment uniformity as well as a decrease of erythema index and pore size. In&#xD;
      this study we evaluate the existence of histopathological evidence that can elucidate the&#xD;
      observed improvement of skin quality after poly-L-lactic acid injections. Specifically we&#xD;
      will use histopathologic techniques to investigate effects of Sculptra injections into human&#xD;
      skin with regard to dermal remodeling and epidermal thickness.This is a randomized,&#xD;
      controlled, double-blind single-center study. The treatment phase will consist of a baseline&#xD;
      visit, visits at 4-week and 8-weeks during which eligible subjects will receive injections of&#xD;
      5 cc of poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) for the treatment group or saline for the control group&#xD;
      into both sides of the face.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seven eligible subjects will receive injections of 5 cc of poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) for the&#xD;
      study treatment group and 3 subjects will receive saline for the control group into both&#xD;
      sides of the face.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The biopsy portion of the study, a punch biopsy will be collected at 4 timepoints throughout&#xD;
      the study: at baseline prior to study treatment one, 4 weeks post study treatment one, 48&#xD;
      hours post study treatment three, and 18 weeks post study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation is up to 28 weeks and will attend approximately 6 study visits. The subject&#xD;
      participation period includes a screening period of up to 2 weeks, three injections at 4-week&#xD;
      intervals, and a follow-up visit at 48 hours and 18 weeks after the last injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      to evaluate the histological effect and the &quot;duration&quot; of repeated subcutaneous injections of&#xD;
      poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) on skin quality. As skin SRG-PLLA-02 quality improvement the&#xD;
      histopathological analysis with assess expression of procollagen 1, CD31 (vessels), SMA&#xD;
      (myofibroblasts), CD163 (macrophages), CD117 (mast cells), &amp; Elastin.&#xD;
