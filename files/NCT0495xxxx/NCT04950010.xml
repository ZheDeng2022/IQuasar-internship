    <textblock>
      This pilot study tests the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a 12-week, 3-arm pilot&#xD;
      exercise trial in which 45 breast cancer survivors will be randomized to high-intensity&#xD;
      interval training (HIIT; n=15), moderate-intensity aerobic training (MOD; n=15), or Usual&#xD;
      Care (UC; n=15).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aim 1: Determine the feasibility and acceptability of a 12-week high-intensity interval&#xD;
      training (HIIT) program compared with a standard moderate-intensity aerobic training (MOD)&#xD;
      program in 45 breast cancer survivors prescribed aromatase inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Calculate effect sizes associated with the 12-week HIIT program, compared with MOD and&#xD;
      Usual Care (UC), on cognitive and cardiovascular functions in 45 breast cancer survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible individuals will be post-menopausal women diagnosed with Stages I-IIIa breast&#xD;
      cancer, have completed primary treatment (i.e., surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation&#xD;
      therapy), and currently prescribed an aromatase inhibitor. The specific aims are: 1)&#xD;
      Determine the feasibility and acceptability of a 12-week high-intensity interval training&#xD;
      (HIIT) program compared with a standard moderate-intensity (MOD) program; and 2) Calculate&#xD;
      effect sizes associated with the 12-week HIIT program, compared with MOD and usual care (UC),&#xD;
      on cognitive and cardiovascular functions. Cognitive function is operationalized as&#xD;
      performance on executive function and working memory tasks. Cardiovascular function is&#xD;
      operationalized as exercise capacity (VO2peak, heart rate recovery), resting function (heart&#xD;
      rate, blood pressure), and cardiovascular structure/function (arterial stiffness, arterial&#xD;
      wall thickness, endothelial function). Associations between change in cardiovascular outcomes&#xD;
      and change in cognitive outcomes across the intervention period will also be explored.&#xD;

    <description>HIIT is a type of training in which short periods of high-intensity anaerobic exercise (1-4 minutes at 80-95% of VO2peak) are alternated with less intense aerobic recovery periods (1-3 minutes at 50-60% VO2peak). Individually-tailored exercise prescriptions will be developed based upon each participant's baseline maximal graded exercise test (heart rate corresponding with %VO2 peak) and symptom limitation. Sessions will be progressive in nature such that the volume of exercise (i.e., number and intensity of intervals) increases across weeks. Intervals will progress from a heart rate corresponding with 75% VO2peak in Week 1 to 90-95% VO2peak in Weeks 9-12. Sessions will be ~30 minutes in length. Indoor cycling is the primary mode of exercise.</description>
