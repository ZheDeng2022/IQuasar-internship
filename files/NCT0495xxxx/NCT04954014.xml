  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our hypothesis is that treating ARDS caused by COVID-19 with bevacizumab improves mortality.&#xD;
      This is a phase II, multi-centered, randomized, open label, two-armed clinical trial to study&#xD;
      the safety and efficacy of bevacizumab in COVID-19 positive patients who consequently&#xD;
      developed ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) and who have previously received&#xD;
      anti-viral and anti-inflammatory treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) improves vascular capillarity, which plays an&#xD;
      important role in the uncontrolled inflammatory reaction that happens in ARDS. As opposed to&#xD;
      this event, angiogenic therapy (like bevacizumab) is known to contribute to normal&#xD;
      vascularization, relevant for regaining vascular permeability. Studies in animal models have&#xD;
      shown that treating ARDS with anti-VEGF therapy is effective.&#xD;
