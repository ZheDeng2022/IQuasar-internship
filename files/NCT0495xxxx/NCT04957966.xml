  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ethnic discrimination is a prevalent problem in the European Union and other regions. In view&#xD;
      of the significant negative impacts of discrimination on mental and physical health, it is of&#xD;
      high relevance to counteract these negative effects and provide appropriate interventions.&#xD;
      This study aims to investigate the feasibility and the effectiveness of a mobile-based&#xD;
      intervention, delivering self-selected relaxing music to buffer biological (salivary&#xD;
      cortisol, salivary alpha-amylase) and psychological (perceived stress, perceived ethnic&#xD;
      discrimination) stress reactions in moments of acute stress and perceived ethnic&#xD;
      discrimination in the everyday life of Turkish immigrant women (N=20, age range 18-65 years).&#xD;
      An intra-individually randomized design will be used, i.e., participants will be instructed&#xD;
      on a random basis to either listen to music (intervention event) or not (control event). The&#xD;
      whole study period consists of 35 days with a baseline period (week 1), intervention period&#xD;
      (week 2-4), and post period (week 5). To investigate the feasibility of the intervention,&#xD;
      post-monitoring interviews will be conducted after the end of the whole study period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The experience of unfair treatment because of one's own ethnicity, i.e., ethnic&#xD;
      discrimination, constitutes a complex stressor which triggers both physical and psychological&#xD;
      stress reactions. In this regard, women may constitute a particularly vulnerable group, as&#xD;
      they may be confronted with intersectional stigmata, i.e., both ethnicity-related and&#xD;
      gender-related stigmata. Considering the resulting health impairments many people with&#xD;
      migration background are confronted with, it is of great importance to provide interventions&#xD;
      with the potential to minimize those negative consequences. Recognizing this necessity, an&#xD;
      ecological momentary music intervention was developed in order to reduce psychological and&#xD;
      biological (cortisol, alpha-amylase) stress levels due to perceived ethnic discrimination in&#xD;
      everyday life. The primary aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility and the&#xD;
      effectiveness of this mobile-based intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that listening to music after an event of acute stress and/or ethnic&#xD;
      discrimination will result in stronger decreases in psychological (perceived stress,&#xD;
      perceived ethnic discrimination), and biological (cortisol, alpha-amylase) stress levels&#xD;
      compared to no music listening in everyday life (immediate effect). Further, it is expected&#xD;
      that a decrease in diurnal psychological and biological stress levels will be observed&#xD;
      throughout the study period (intermediate effect) and that participants will start to consume&#xD;
      or increase their deliberate consumption of music after an event of acute stress and/or&#xD;
      ethnic discrimination in their everyday life after the intervention (behavior change). In&#xD;
      addition, it is hypothesized that the feasibility of the intervention will be confirmed by&#xD;
      participants' self-reports of high usefulness of and satisfaction with the intervention as&#xD;
      well as by a high usage rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is as follows: Baseline period (week 1), intervention period (week 2 to 4),&#xD;
      post period (week 5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the baseline and post period, psychological and biological stress fluctuations and&#xD;
      perceived ethnic discrimination in daily life will be assessed. To this end, participants&#xD;
      will be signaled three times a day in a semi-random order in order to answer questions on&#xD;
      their momentary levels of stress, perceived discrimination, positive and negative affect, and&#xD;
      their music-listening activities (time-contingent data entries). Additionally, whenever a&#xD;
      stressful or discriminatory event occurs, participants are instructed to initiate a data&#xD;
      entry by themselves in order to report their momentary levels of stress, perceived&#xD;
      discrimination, positive and negative affect, and to answer questions on the current&#xD;
      situation. To investigate activities after such self-initiated, event-contingent data&#xD;
      entries, the app will signal the participants 20 (post 1) and 35 minutes (post 2) later for&#xD;
      an additional data entry. As part of every time-contingent and event-contingent report,&#xD;
      participants will provide a saliva sample in order to examine biological stress markers:&#xD;
      salivary cortisol levels as index of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA axis) activity,&#xD;
      salivary alpha-amylase as index of autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A daily diary assessment will be conducted every evening at the same time. In this diary,&#xD;
      participants will be asked about their current perceived stress, perceived discrimination,&#xD;
      positive and negative affect, fatigue, coping strategies. Additionally, they will be asked&#xD;
      whether discriminatory events had happened over the course of the day and if so, to describe&#xD;
      the event(s). For this data entry, no saliva sample will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the Intervention period (week 2 to 4), the sampling protocol will be the same as in&#xD;
      baseline and post period (i.e., time-contingent data entries, daily diary assessment,&#xD;
      self-initiated event-contingent data entries, post 1, post 2). Additionally, after every&#xD;
      self-initiated event-contingent report, participants will be randomly assigned (50:50) to&#xD;
      either the intervention event (listening to music for 20 minutes) or the control event (no&#xD;
      music listening, continue the activity before the data entry). This approach constitutes an&#xD;
      intra-individually randomized design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the feasibility of the intervention, qualitative data from post-monitoring&#xD;
      interviews will be gathered at the end of the study period.&#xD;
