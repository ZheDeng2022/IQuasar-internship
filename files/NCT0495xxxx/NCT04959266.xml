  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, non-randomised, 3-arm (A, B, and C), drug-drug interaction&#xD;
      study in patients with advanced solid tumours.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will include 3 arms consisting of a screening period of up to 28 days (Day -28 to&#xD;
      Day -1), an intervention period (12 days for arm A, 17 days for arm B, and 12 days for arm&#xD;
      C), and a follow-up end of treatment [EOT] visit (within 3 days after a 4-day washout period&#xD;
      relative to the last dose of adavosertib).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A of this study follows a non-randomised, open-label, 2-intervention design. Patients&#xD;
      will receive the following 2 study interventions: a single oral dose of adavosertib alone,&#xD;
      and a single oral dose of adavosertib administered concomitantly with itraconazole.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm B of this study follows a non-randomised, open-label, 2-intervention design. Patients&#xD;
      will receive the following 2 study interventions: a single oral dose of adavosertib alone,&#xD;
      and a single oral dose of adavosertib administered concomitantly with rifampicin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm C of this study follows a non-randomised, open-label, 2-intervention design. Patients&#xD;
      will receive the following 2 study interventions: a single oral dose of adavosertib alone,&#xD;
      and a single oral dose of adavosertib administered concomitantly with omeprazole.&#xD;
