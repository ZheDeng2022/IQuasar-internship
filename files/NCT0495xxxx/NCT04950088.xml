  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Distraction techniques, such as use of a virtual reality device, have been used to augment or&#xD;
      replace pharmacological practices for relief of anxiety in pediatric patients prior to&#xD;
      surgical procedures. This relief can not only benefit medical staff, as procedures may be&#xD;
      easier to perform and require less time, but also have a calming effect on the the parent&#xD;
      during the procedure if they feel that their child is being better cared for. In addition,&#xD;
      decreased anxiety prior to surgical procedures have been shown to reduce maladaptive&#xD;
      behaviors post-operatively. This prospective study plans to evaluate the anxiety level of&#xD;
      parents and pediatric patients in an outpatient surgery center pre-, during and&#xD;
      post-operatively with and without the use of a virtual reality distraction device. The goal&#xD;
      is to determine the existence of correlations between distraction techniques (in this case,&#xD;
      the use of handheld video games) pediatric patient anxiety, parental anxiety, and parental&#xD;
      satisfaction with the experience surrounding the procedure.&#xD;

      General Data will be collected for patients being treated at Patewood Outpatient Surgery&#xD;
      Center following legal guardian consent. Patients receiving surgical treatment involving the&#xD;
      use of an anesthesia mask, age 4 to 10, will be included in the study. Exclusion criteria&#xD;
      will include ear tube cases, patients physically incapable to play a video game, patients of&#xD;
      non-English speaking caregivers, and patients without legal guardian present day of surgery.&#xD;
      IV Ear tube cases are too short a procedure for data collection and at least one caretaker&#xD;
      must be capable of taking both an oral and written survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the purposes of this study, a &quot;caregiver&quot; will be defined as an adult that spends a&#xD;
      significant amount of time with the patient, and meets the following criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary caregiver is the adult that is responsible for the minor patients' care. The&#xD;
      caregiver may reside with the patient full-time or part-time but have the information&#xD;
      necessary to assess the child's behavior before and after the outpatient procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected for each patient will include demographics, random placement in Video Game/No&#xD;
      Video game group, surgical procedure, information normally recorded by surgeon or&#xD;
      anesthesiologist including duration of surgery and duration under anesthesia, caregiver&#xD;
      reported changes in patient behavior following surgery, and scores of the anxiety being felt&#xD;
      by caregivers and patients. Anxiety scores will be determined using shortened versions of&#xD;
      validated anxiety scoring assessments. Behavioral changes will be recorded using a shortened&#xD;
      version of the Post Hospital Behavior Questionnaire (PHBQ). Assessments have been shortened&#xD;
      to increase study participation, and eliminate any impact the study may have had on&#xD;
      day-to-day operations at Patewood Outpatient Surgery Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caregivers will also be asked to fill out a hospital created survey related to how satisfied&#xD;
      they are with the care of the patient. It will be referred to as the Preoperative Hospital&#xD;
      Satisfaction Survey (PHSS). This survey will be administered while the surgical procedure is&#xD;
      in progress, when the caregivers are sitting in the waiting room. The survey is to be a&#xD;
      reflection of how caregivers perceive preoperative separation care given to patients, so will&#xD;
      not be influenced by surgical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent Legal guardians of patients are contacted over the phone by Patewood Outpatient&#xD;
      Surgery Center registration per standard preoperative care procedure. Before concluding the&#xD;
      normal preoperative interview, a script will be read that introduces the guardian to the&#xD;
      study and its goals. The guardian will then be asked if they are interested in learning more&#xD;
      about the study. Those who answer &quot;no&quot; will be removed from a list of potential participants.&#xD;
      Those who answer &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;maybe&quot; will be given more information about study participation&#xD;
      after arriving at the outpatient surgery center on the day of their scheduled appointment. A&#xD;
      more thorough explanation of the study will be given and any questions answered. If a&#xD;
      guardian is interested in participating, they will be provided a consent form to fill out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group assignment Patients will be assigned into a &quot;Video Game group&quot; or a &quot;No Video Game&#xD;
      group.&quot; All patients on any particular day will be assigned into the same group. This is done&#xD;
      to prevent one patient from feeling disappointed after seeing another patient with a video&#xD;
      game, and then learning they may not have one. Group assignment will alternate each day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment and Survey Descriptions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modified Yale Preoperative Scale (mYPAS)- Observational survey used to quickly score the&#xD;
      anxiety level of children during preoperative holding and induction of anesthesia. It has&#xD;
      frequent use and validation as an accurate tool for determining the anxiety level of&#xD;
      pediatric surgical patients. Each section has 4 to 6 numbers listed, each corresponding with&#xD;
      different patient description. For each section, the number by the most accurate patient&#xD;
      description is circled. (Jenkins)(Kain)&#xD;
&#xD;
      State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)- Self-taken survey for adults. Gives 2 different scores.&#xD;
      One score is an indicator of susceptibility to stressful situations, the other score is the&#xD;
      level of anxiety felt while taking the survey. It has frequent use and validation as a tool&#xD;
      for determining anxiety levels of adults. (Spielberger)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post Hospital Behavior Questionnaire (PHBQ)- Survey taken by primary caregiver of a patient&#xD;
      after leaving the hospital. The survey is designed to identify maladaptive behaviors a&#xD;
      patient has developed following a time at a hospital. Questions must be answered &quot;much less&#xD;
      than before&quot;, &quot;less than before&quot;, &quot;same as before&quot;, &quot;more than before&quot;, or &quot;much more than&#xD;
      before&quot;. This survey is sensitive only to the change in frequency of behaviors, not their&#xD;
      presence or absence. Therefore, undesirable behavior existing prior to a hospital stay should&#xD;
      have no influence on the PHBQ score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All surveys used in this study were truncated. Any modification was evaluated and approved by&#xD;
      the staff psychologist (PhD.) familiar with using surveys to research anxiety and stress of&#xD;
      patients and their families. Any questions that were included or excluded from the surveys&#xD;
      was done so under expert direction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perioperative Holding After completing standard preoperative procedure, a nurse will complete&#xD;
      a short observational survey (mYPAS [modified Yale Preoperative Scale] or mYPAS-SF) to score&#xD;
      the patients current anxiety level. Just prior to separation from the caregiver, the patient&#xD;
      will be given (or not given) a Video Game by the nurse. During separation, another mYPAS will&#xD;
      be scored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operating Room Another mYPAS will be scored during the induction of anesthesia. If the&#xD;
      patient has a video game, the patient is allowed to play as long as he/she wants. Often&#xD;
      times, this is up until the procedure begins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caregivers During Procedure One or two primary caregivers will be asked to fill out a&#xD;
      shortened STAI (State Trait Anxiety Inventory) and PHSS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Phone Calls The day following surgery, standard postoperative care procedure will&#xD;
      be followed. This includes a phone call to the caregiver of a patient. Before concluding the&#xD;
      phone call, the instructions at the top of the shortened PHBQ will be read to the caregivers&#xD;
      participating in the survey. Then each question will be read and answered. One week and 2&#xD;
      weeks following surgery, the caregiver will be called and the shortened PHBQ will be&#xD;
      administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics The existence of correlations between maladaptive behavior, patient anxiety,&#xD;
      caregiver susceptibility to anxiety, caregiver experience of anxiety, caregiver satisfaction,&#xD;
      video game use, and any other collected data will be determined. All information from this&#xD;
      study will be used to describe our cohort only. All data will be expressed in summary and is&#xD;
      meant to contribute to the generalizable knowledge of the field.&#xD;

    <description>The Strait-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)17 assessed self-reported parental anxiety (below). The STAI was completed by the parent immediately after separation in the waiting room. STAI consists of two parts: A= perceived anxiety during the child's perioperative period; B= the parent's general state of anxiety. Differences between these two metrics were used to indicate parental satisfaction with their experience.&#xD;
The A questions were evaluated with the following scale (1-4) utilizing the descriptors&#xD;
'Not at all' 'Somewhat' 'Moderately So' 'Very Much So' in response to 7 statements.&#xD;
The B section regarding generalized anxiety was measured as follows (1-4) utilizing the descriptors&#xD;
'Not at all' 'Somewhat' 'Moderately So' 'Very Much So' in response to 7 statements different from the A section.&#xD;
The final question is as follows (Y/N):&#xD;

    <description>The PHBQ queried change in perceived patient's behavior before and after the procedure with an inquiry regarding new-onset negative behaviors manifesting post-surgery. Three attempts were made to gather survey information for each time-point; if a parent could not be reached, data collection for that patient was truncated. Each of the three follow-up calls were completed utilizing the same protocol. The protocol consisted of 10 questions regarding the child's behavior with parent answers utilizing the following scale:&#xD;
much less less same more much more&#xD;
The final question was a rank from 1-10 with 10 being the worst (highest) score:&#xD;
11. On a scale from 1 to 10, 1 being no pain and 10 being more pain, how would you rate your child's current pain level?&#xD;
