      The aim of the study is to investigate a possible correlation between the change in PCO2&#xD;
      during a hyperoxia-test and the change in PCO2 during walking in people with COPD&#xD;
    </textblock>

      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carbon dioxide partial pressure (PCO2) varies significantly in patients with advanced chronic&#xD;
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Data from the Swedish LTOT Registry showed that PCO2 is&#xD;
      an independent predictor for mortality and that there is a U-shaped relationship. Patients&#xD;
      with advanced COPD who are still normocapnic at rest may still develop a clinically relevant,&#xD;
      exercise-induced carbon dioxide (CO2) retention during exercise/ activity. It is also known&#xD;
      that altered breathing patterns at night in COPD patients can lead to nocturnal hypercapnia,&#xD;
      especially during REM sleep. The course of PCO2 cannot be reliably predicted by lung function&#xD;
      parameters or resting blood gas analysis. Since exercise tests with blood gas control or&#xD;
      nightly PCO2 monitoring are rarely performed in clinical routine, exercise induced CO2&#xD;
      retention often remains undetected. In the literature, there is little information on PCO2&#xD;
      behaviour under everyday conditions (with or without LTOT) such as rest, physical exertion&#xD;
      and nightly sleep. Therefore, predictors that could describe the PCO2 patterns are missing.&#xD;
      However, one former study by O'Donnel from 2002 showed that the change in CO2 under hyperoxia&#xD;
      conditions could provide predictive information for the change in CO2 with exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary aim of this study is to investigate whether the change of PCO2 during a&#xD;
      hyperoxia-test (10l/min O2 at rest) correlates with the change of PCO2 during walking&#xD;
      exercise with either a: l/min O2 as prescribed; b: medical air; c: 10l/min O2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a randomized, controlled cross-over trial. Following an initial maximal&#xD;
      incremental shuttle walk test (ISWT), the participant will perform 3 endurance shuttle walk&#xD;
      tests (ESWT) at 85% of the maximum ISWT pace on three consecutive days (24h break between&#xD;
      ESWTs). In a randomized order, participants will perform one ESWTs with O2-flow as prescribed&#xD;
      (e.g. study day 1), one with medical air (same flow rate as prescribed oxygen) (e.g. study&#xD;
      day 2) and one with 10l/min O2 (e.g. study day 3). An additional hyperoxia test (10l/min O2&#xD;
      for ten minutes; at resting condition) will be perfomed on each day prior to performing an&#xD;
      ESWT.&#xD;
