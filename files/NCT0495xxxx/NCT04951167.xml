      EFFECT OF DIFFERENT NOREPINPHRINE APPLICATION METHODS IN CAESARIANES ON HYPOTENSION AFTER&#xD;
      SPINAL ANESTHESIA INTRODUCTION Spinal anesthesia in cesarean sections is a frequently used&#xD;
      anesthesia technique today. The most common complication associated with spinal anesthesia is&#xD;
      hypotension. Systemic vascular resistance and cardiac output decrease due to sympathetic&#xD;
      blockade, and when this is accompanied by bradycardia and contractility, hypotension&#xD;
      develops(1,2,3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maternal hypotension is a condition that can cause negative consequences such as nausea,&#xD;
      vomiting, and dizziness in pregnant women who undergo spinal anesthesia. In addition, it&#xD;
      increases the likelihood of fetal acidosis, hypoxia, and neonatal neurological damage.&#xD;
      Therefore, it is necessary to treat maternal hypotension effectively. In the current&#xD;
      treatment of maternal hypotension, intravenous fluid administration, treatments such as&#xD;
      ephedrine, phenylephrine, and norepinephrine are used (4,5,7). Among these drugs, ephedrine&#xD;
      is the first preferred vasopressor (4). For this reason, its efficacy and safety, and the use&#xD;
      of different doses have been extensively studied (5,7). Ephedrine is a vasopressor with both&#xD;
      direct and indirect effects in the treatment of hypotension due to neuraxial block in&#xD;
      obstetrics with its alpha and beta agonist effects. The most important disadvantage of&#xD;
      ephedrine is that it has a slow onset and weak effect, difficulty in titration, development&#xD;
      of tachyphylaxis, causing maternal tachy-arrhythmias and fetal acidosis (9). Ephedrine easily&#xD;
      crosses the placenta and causes fetal tachycardia, an increase in noradrenaline concentration&#xD;
      in the umbilical artery (UA), and a decrease in pH and base excess (BE). An increase in fetal&#xD;
      metabolic rate, an increase in fetal O2 consumption and CO2 production, and an increase in&#xD;
      lactate level are observed through beta-adrenergic stimulation (9). Phenylephrine, on the&#xD;
      other hand, is a pure alpha-agonist agent that is more potent (phenylephrine/ephedrine:&#xD;
      80:1), easy to titrate, effectively treats hypotension and nausea-vomiting, has minimal&#xD;
      placental transfer, and does not cause fetal acidosis and changes (10-11). However, the&#xD;
      disadvantage of phenylephrine is that it decreases maternal heart rate and cardiac output&#xD;
      (12). Another vasopressor drug used in the treatment of hypotension in recent years is&#xD;
      norepinephrine. Norepinephrine is both an α-receptor agonist and a weak β-receptor agonist&#xD;
      (7,8). Theoretically, it lowers heart rate and cardiac output less.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are previous studies in which norepinephrine was administered only as a prophylactic or&#xD;
      only infusion to prevent hypotension after spinal anesthesia in cesarean sections. However,&#xD;
      there are not enough studies reporting which of these application methods are more effective.&#xD;
      Therefore, in our study, cesarean section under spinal anesthesia was planned; We aimed to&#xD;
      investigate the effectiveness of norepinephrine differential administration methods on&#xD;
      preventing maternal hypotension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WORKING PROTOCOL After the approval of the faculty ethics committee, the written and verbal&#xD;
      consent of the patients will be obtained, and a double-blind randomized study will be&#xD;
      initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnant women over the age of 18, with ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists physical&#xD;
      status) ≤ III, body weight 50-100 kg and height 150-180 cm, with a single pregnancy planned&#xD;
      for cesarean section under elective conditions under spinal anesthesia, will be included in&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnant women with allergy or hypersensitivity to norepinephrine, pre-existing hypertension&#xD;
      or pregnancy-induced hypertension, cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, renal failure,&#xD;
      history of thrombosis in the mesenteric or peripheral vessels, history of diabetes with known&#xD;
      fetal anomalies, users of monoaminooxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants and those&#xD;
      who refused to study were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnant women will be randomly divided into 4 groups using the closed envelope method. The&#xD;
      person who prepares the study drugs and follows the study will be different and unaware of&#xD;
      the study. Following standard aspiration prophylaxis and monitoring, peripheral vascular&#xD;
      access will be established with an 18-G catheter and 1 ml/kg/hour Ringer Lactate solution&#xD;
      will be started. Basal systolic blood pressure will be determined by measuring heart rate&#xD;
      values every 2 minutes and averaging the 3 values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spinal anesthesia will be provided in the sitting position with a 25-gauge Quinke spinal&#xD;
      needle through the L3-L4 or L4-L5 spacing with 2-2.2 ml of hyperbaric bupivacaine and 15 mcg&#xD;
      of fentanyl. Immediately after spinal anesthesia, the pregnant woman will be placed in the&#xD;
      supine position, with a pillow placed under the right hip (30 tilts to the left) and rapid&#xD;
      coloading with 10 ml/kg Ringer Lactate at a maximum of 1 L with the help of a pump.&#xD;
      Afterwards, the mai rate will be reduced to 1 ml/kg/hour again. For the study, norepinephrine&#xD;
      will be prepared at 4 mcg/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Group PB, an IV bolus of 4 mcg will be administered immediately after spinal anesthesia,&#xD;
      and then SF infusion will be started at 1 ml/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Group PI, 1ml of saline is administered immediately after spinal anesthesia, and then&#xD;
      infusion will be started with the study drugat 1 ml/min.(4mcg/min) In Group TB, immediately&#xD;
      after spinal anesthesia, 1 ml of saline, followed by 1 ml/min infusion of SF, and when the&#xD;
      blood pressure decreases by 20%, 1 ml of working solution and then 1 ml/min of saline&#xD;
      infusion will be started.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Group TBI, 1 ml of study drug and 1 ml/min of study drug infusion will be started&#xD;
      immediately after spinal anesthesia, after 1 ml of saline followed by 1 ml/min of SF infusion&#xD;
      when blood pressure decreases by 20% of the entry. Heart rate and blood pressure and pulse&#xD;
      oximetry will be recorded every 2 minutes from intrathecal drug administration until&#xD;
      delivery. When systolic blood pressure drops more than 20% compared to baseline, it will be&#xD;
      considered as hypotension and an additional 4 mcg (1 ml) norepinephrine will be administered&#xD;
      in all groups, and if it continues in the next measurement, a second dose of 4 mcg&#xD;
      norepinephrine will be administered. Hypotension that does not improve despite two&#xD;
      measurements will be treated with an IV bolus of 10 mg of ephedrine. According to entry, 40%&#xD;
      or more will be considered severe hypotension and treated with 15 mg of ephedrine. If the&#xD;
      heart rate drops to 50 beats/minute, bradycardia will be considered and treated with 0.5 mg&#xD;
      of atropine. Hypertension will be considered as a 20% increase in systolic blood pressure&#xD;
      from baseline and treated with a 0.1 mg bolus of nitroglycerin iv. The study protocol will be&#xD;
      terminated after the delivery of the fetus, but anesthetist bolus norepinephrine&#xD;
      administration will be continued for the treatment of hypotension. The number of episodes of&#xD;
      hypotension and hypertension, bradycardia, nausea, vomiting, tremor, sensory block level,&#xD;
      Apgar score, umbilical artery and vein values, time from intrathecal injection to delivery,&#xD;
      uterine incision delivery times will be recorded.&#xD;
