  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety disorders are highly prevalent and costly to the individual and society.&#xD;
      Exposure-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the gold-standard intervention for&#xD;
      anxiety disorders, although this approach does not fully reduce symptoms for all individuals.&#xD;
      Therefore there is a need for innovative intervention approaches. One approach to augment and&#xD;
      improve existing therapies would be to enhance the neurocognitive basis of fear extinction&#xD;
      processes, which are the model on which treatments are based. Enhancing these processes may&#xD;
      be possible through computerized cognitive training techniques which target executive&#xD;
      functioning, the cognitive processes that help people manage complex cognitive activities.&#xD;
      The proposed project is a proof-of-concept pilot study investigating the potential for&#xD;
      training of executive functioning to improve anxiety-related outcomes. Individuals with&#xD;
      elevated levels of social anxiety will be randomized to single-session COGnitive Enhancement&#xD;
      Training (COGENT) or sham training program (ST). All participants will complete a single&#xD;
      speech session where they present three 7-minute impromptu speeches and rate their anxiety at&#xD;
      specific intervals. Participants will then complete the COGENT paradigm and affective&#xD;
      processing task while undergoing fMRI.&#xD;
