  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity can enhance well-being among youth diagnosed with oncological or&#xD;
      hematological diseases. We developed a tailored, 1:1, online physical activity program (i.e.,&#xD;
      IMPACT), to promote physical activity in this cohort. The proposed single-group,&#xD;
      mixed-methods project will assess the effect of IMPACT and explore markers of implementation.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will receive the IMPACT program, which includes a combination of aerobic, resistance, balance, and flexibility exercises conducted 1:1 and delivered online by a physical activity specialist via Zoom. The IMPACT program follows basic physical activity progression principles (i.e., principles of frequency, intensity, time, type, overload and progression). Tailoring will be used to promote fitness and wellness benefits, while ensuring safety. In addition, prominent behaviour change techniques will be provided by physical activity specialists within each 1:1 session. Discussions and worksheets will be provided, depending on participants needs.</description>
