    <textblock>
      Addiction is a public health issue that affects nearly 30% of French people according to&#xD;
      INSEE. For several years now, the investigators have known that sport is a real help in the&#xD;
      fight against addictions, with recent medical authorization to prescribe physical activities.&#xD;
      A study from August 2016 claims that regular physical activity may offset the harmful effects&#xD;
      of alcohol. (1) Based on the answers given by 36,370 Britons between 1994 and 2006, the&#xD;
      researchers showed the existence of a link between the practice of 150 minutes of physical&#xD;
      activity per week and the decrease in deaths linked to consumption. alcohol. These results,&#xD;
      compared to 18 other studies (2), reveal the benefits of physical activity in the management&#xD;
      of addictions. But what about current practice and addictions and sports practice in general&#xD;
      ?&#xD;
