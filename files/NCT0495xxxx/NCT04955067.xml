      The purpose of this study is to study the injury of the anterior talofibular ligament by deep&#xD;
      learning method and compare a variety of different deep learning models to establish a deep&#xD;
      learning method that can accurately identify and grade the injury of anterior talofibular&#xD;
      ligament, and obtain a model with better recognition and grading effect.&#xD;

      1. Recognition and segmentation of anterior talofibular ligament based on DenseNet.&#xD;
           Densenet was used to recognize the axial T2-fs image, and the image level was the most&#xD;
           typical one. The labelimg program based on Python was used to locate the coordinates of&#xD;
           the anterior talofibular ligament and then imported into Python for learning. All the&#xD;
           data were divided into a training set (70%, and then 30% of the training set was&#xD;
           selected as the verification set). The remaining 30% was used as the test set to&#xD;
           evaluate the accuracy of model recognition. After identifying the anterior talofibular&#xD;
           ligament, the local clipping and amplification are carried out to remove the redundant&#xD;
           information. Finally, input the result to the next step.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Establishment and comparison of various deep learning models: four deep learning models&#xD;
           were established and compared in this study, namely VGG19, AlexNet, CapsNet, and&#xD;
           GoogleNet. The models using image fitting alone and those combining with clinical&#xD;
           physical examination data were compared for each deep learning model. The diagnostic&#xD;
           efficiency between models was expressed by the ROC curve, including AUC, F1 score, etc.&#xD;
           the ROC curve was further analyzed by t-test, Delong test, and other statistical&#xD;
           methods. In this study, the data were divided into a training set (70%, 30% in the&#xD;
           training set as the validation set), and the remaining 30% as the test set to evaluate&#xD;
           the classification accuracy.&#xD;
