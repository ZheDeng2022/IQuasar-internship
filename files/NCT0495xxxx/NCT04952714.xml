  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication in critically ill patients. Multiple&#xD;
      studies have reported evidence that the main cause of ARF is sepsis, as part of the Multiple&#xD;
      Organ Dysfunction Syndrome: up to 50% of septic patients develop acute renal failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RRT continues to be the standard management for severe acute renal failure, especially in its&#xD;
      continuous modality and applied to the septic patient, generally with hemodynamic&#xD;
      instability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of SA-AKI (sepsis-associated acute kidney injury) is associated with short-term&#xD;
      and long-term adverse events, which include: prolonged hospital stay, the development of&#xD;
      chronic kidney disease (CKD), increased cardiovascular risk and increased risk of death. Its&#xD;
      presence is even considered a factor with an independent association with mortality and has a&#xD;
      higher fatality rate than ARF developed by another etiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different clinical studies have been developed based on the addition of hemoadsorption&#xD;
      membranes to RRT that, although they have not shown significant differences in the reduction&#xD;
      of mortality, have impacted secondary outcomes such as the reduction of pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines, decrease in vasopressor support requirements, decrease in serum lactate,&#xD;
      significant improvement in the SOFA score, improvement in oxygenation indices and decrease in&#xD;
      hospital stay. These benefits are presented without reports of adverse events associated with&#xD;
      its use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The oXiris® filter was recently developed: a single high permeability membrane capable of&#xD;
      removing cytokines and endotoxins during renal support with the addition of antithrombotic&#xD;
      properties. The experience of its use is limited to in vitro studies, case reports,&#xD;
      retrospective cohorts and an RCT that provide consistent evidence of its benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A longitudinal, bi-directional, observational analytical study is proposed. A case-control&#xD;
      study nested in a dynamic cohort will be developed to determine the effect of the use of&#xD;
      hemofiltration with a cytokine removal filter (oXiris®) on the decrease in mortality at 28&#xD;
      days of patients with acute kidney injury induced by sepsis. (SA-AKI), as well as the dose of&#xD;
      vasopressor support, oxygenation parameters and inflammatory markers.&#xD;

    <description>Initially, participants who meet the inclusion criteria will be recruited to assemble a cohort of patients with sepsis and those who develop sepsis-induced acute kidney injury will be observed.&#xD;
Through a previously established and standardized management protocol, the treating team will prescribe renal replacement therapy by hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) in the PrismaFlex device (Baxter), at a dose of 25 mL / Kg of PrismaSate dialysis solution (Baxter) and the removal filter oXiris® cytokines (Baxter) vs. the standard filter, for patients who require it, in the presence of a confirmed diagnosis of acute renal failure.&#xD;
Hemodynamic and ventilatory parameters will be monitored every 24 hours, and inflammatory parameters every 48 hours. A follow-up will be done at 28 days to establish mortality.</description>
