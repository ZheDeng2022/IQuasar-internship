  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to describe the effect of neuromuscular electrical stimulation&#xD;
      (NMES) in the form of functional electrical stimulation (FES) applied to different lower limb&#xD;
      muscles on reactive balance and gait performance in stroke participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Twenty individuals with chronic stroke will be asked to perform an experimental&#xD;
      protocol that includes a postural disturbance in the form of a slip- or trip-like&#xD;
      perturbation and a standardized walking test in both laboratory and outdoor environments with&#xD;
      and without FES applied to different lower limb muscles of the paretic leg. FES will be&#xD;
      applied using an advanced software that is able to synchronize muscle activation with the&#xD;
      time of perturbation onset and according to the phases of gait.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project design aims to examine whether a specific pattern of lower limb muscle&#xD;
      stimulation could improve the kinematic and behavioral responses during reactive balance&#xD;
      following slip- and trip-like perturbations. Additionally, the project aims to see if the&#xD;
      kinematic and spatio-temporal gait parameters can be modified during a standardized walking&#xD;
      test under different sensory and environmental conditions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Functional impairment after a stroke often includes slowed gait velocity and increased fall&#xD;
      risk attributed to foot drop (the inability to dorsiflex the ankle during the swing phase of&#xD;
      gait) and lower limb muscle weakness. Damage in the motor cortex or corticospinal tract often&#xD;
      results in significant, persistent distal muscle weakness, including the sensorimotor control&#xD;
      of the ankle joint, typically because of a combination of weakness of the agonist ankle&#xD;
      dorsiflexor muscles and spasticity of the antagonist plantar flexor muscle. This results in&#xD;
      slower and abnormal gait which leads to gait compensation strategies such as hip hitching,&#xD;
      excess circumduction during gait, reduced foot clearance, and high energy expenditure, all of&#xD;
      which are factors which could increase the risk of falls in individuals with stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional electrical stimulation (FES) corresponds to the application of an electric field&#xD;
      across the motor neurons of a muscle to induce an artificial, involuntary contraction to&#xD;
      perform a functional movement. Numerous benefits of FES have been reported throughout&#xD;
      literature such as increased muscle mass, increased bone mineral density, and improved&#xD;
      cardiovascular parameters, among others. Previous studies in which authors assessed the&#xD;
      effect of FES on individuals with stroke have demonstrated that the common peroneal nerve&#xD;
      stimulates the tibialis anterior muscle to produce foot dorsiflexion during the swing phase&#xD;
      of the gait cycle and reduces foot drop by facilitating increased voluntary muscle activity,&#xD;
      which together improves the quality and symmetry of gait. Additionally, others studies showed&#xD;
      that FES improves walking speed and energy expenditure in individuals with stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the last years, FES systems have been used as neuroprosthetic devices in rehabilitative&#xD;
      interventions such as gait training. Stimulator triggers, implemented to control stimulation&#xD;
      delivery, range from open- to closed-loop controllers.12 Finite-state controllers trigger&#xD;
      stimulators when specific conditions are met and utilize preset sequences of stimulation.&#xD;
      Thus, wearable sensors provide the necessary input to differentiate gait phases during&#xD;
      walking and trigger stimulation to specific muscles.13 This technology has been largely used&#xD;
      to improve gait parameters in stroke participants, however, it has not been well described&#xD;
      how this technology could help stroke participants during the loss of balance or during&#xD;
      reactive balance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, the literature suggests that a direct transcortical loop does not trigger&#xD;
      the initial phase of postural responses to external perturbations, but it seems likely that&#xD;
      the cerebral cortex becomes involved in the later phases of the reactive response.14 Thus,&#xD;
      given that postural response lasts for many hundreds of milliseconds, it may be that the&#xD;
      brainstem or spinal cord circuits initiate a response, and then the response subsequently&#xD;
      becomes modified by cortical circuits during its later phases.15 In this context, the effect&#xD;
      of peripheral stimulation to the muscles involved in the reactive response to an unexpected&#xD;
      external perturbation on recovery performance has not yet been described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project aims to describe whether a specific pattern of lower limb muscle stimulation&#xD;
      could modify the recovery response after an unexpected perturbation in the form of a slip&#xD;
      and/or trip in individuals with stroke. Also, this project aims to examine if a specific&#xD;
      pattern of lower limb muscle stimulation provided by FES can modify kinematic and&#xD;
      spatio-temporal gait parameters during a standardized walking test under different sensory&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
