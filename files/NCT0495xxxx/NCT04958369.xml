  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The implantation of cardiac electronic devices is a common procedure in the Electrophysiology&#xD;
      Laboratory. The most commonly used venous access sites are the cephalic, the axillary and the&#xD;
      subclavian vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies comparing these options have been conducted in the past. Axillary venous access can&#xD;
      be achieved either through axillary vein angiography or by ultrasound guidance. Nevertheless,&#xD;
      appropriate training is required for the ultrasound-guided axillary puncture technique-as&#xD;
      well as for the cephalic vein cutdown technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from randomized trials regarding direct comparison of the two methods in terms of&#xD;
      efficacy and safety are very limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is the comparison of the efficacy and safety of the&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided axillary venous access technique versus the cephalic venous access using&#xD;
      the cut-down technique in patients requiring intravenous cardiac device&#xD;
      (single-chamber/dual-chamber pacemaker/defibrillator) implantation.&#xD;

      This study is a single-center, randomized, clinical trial. Its purpose is the comparison of&#xD;
      the ultrasound-guided axillary venous access technique versus the cephalic venous access&#xD;
      using the cut-down technique in cardiac device implantation procedures. Prerequisite for&#xD;
      starting patients' recruitment is that the operators have undergone a training phase in&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided axillary vein puncture in the Interventional Radiology Laboratory and have&#xD;
      completed at least 30 procedures. A GE V-scan device with a special linear transducer for&#xD;
      vessel examination will be utilized for the ultrasound guidance. Micropuncture technique will&#xD;
      be performed for venous access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age â‰¥ 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Indication for single- or dual-chamber pacemaker of defibrillator implantation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Written informed consent Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Indication for biventricular pacemaker or defibrillator&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Upgrade in pacing or defibrillation system&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the operators' training phase, candidates for pacemaker or defibrillator (single- or&#xD;
      dual-chamber) implantation who fulfill the inclusion criteria will be randomly assigned with&#xD;
      1:1 allocation to one of the Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. ultrasound-guided axillary venous access B. cephalic venous access through the cut-down&#xD;
      technique In case of access failure in Group A, the alternative puncture options are through&#xD;
      the cephalic vein, the axillary vein with angiography guidance, the axillary vein without&#xD;
      angiography guidance or the subclavian vein. In case of access failure in Group B which&#xD;
      includes the insertion of only one lead wire or none, the alternative puncture options are&#xD;
      through the axillary vein with angiography, the axillary vein without angiopraghy or the&#xD;
      subclavian vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data of the study participants that will be recorded include: demographics, Body Mass Index&#xD;
      (BMI), cardiovascular risk factors, comorbidities, indication for cardiac device&#xD;
      implantation, type of device (pacemaker/defibrillator, single-chamber/dual-chamber), side of&#xD;
      implantation (right, left), type of pocket (subcutaneous, submuscular).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding NOAC administration, patients will undergo the implantation procedure after&#xD;
      cessation of rivaroxaban for at least 20 hours before the procedure and apixaban or&#xD;
      dabigatran for at least 16 hours before the procedure. Longer periods of cessation will be&#xD;
      applied in patients with renal dysfunction. In patients on treatment with acenocoumarol or&#xD;
      warfarin, procedures will be performed without discontinuation of the drugs with target&#xD;
      INR=2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding anticoagulation management in patients with mechanical valves the following&#xD;
      anticoagulation management plan will be applied: i) in patients with metallic aortic valve,&#xD;
      no discontinuation of anticoagulation with target INR=2 and ii) in patients with metallic&#xD;
      mitral valve, no discontinuation of anticoagulation, with target INR&lt;3-4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is that ultrasound-guided axillary venous access will lead to a higher&#xD;
      rate of successful implantation procedures compared to cephalic vein access through the&#xD;
      cut-down technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on available research data and pilot data, the hypothesis is that the success rate in&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided axillary venous access group will be 90% compared to 65% in the cephalic&#xD;
      venous access group. A sample size of 57 patients in each group is expected to offer&#xD;
      statistic power of 90% (a=0.05, two-tailed) to the aforementioned result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has been approved by the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital of Patras. All&#xD;
      candidates will participate after written informed consent.&#xD;
