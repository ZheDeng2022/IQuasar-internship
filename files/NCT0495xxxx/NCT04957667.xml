  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate long term outcomes of surgical intervention for Hirschsprung's&#xD;
      disease and to explore the relation between scintigraphic defecography, type of surgery&#xD;
      performed and symptoms as evaluated by a disease specific questionnaire.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hirschsprung's disease (HD) is a congenital deficiency with incomplete development of nerves&#xD;
      in the gastrointestinal tract leading to absence of peristalsis in the affected segment of&#xD;
      bowel. Most patients require surgical intervention with removal of the affected segment of&#xD;
      bowel. Physical symptoms affecting quality of life are not uncommon in patients born with HD&#xD;
      in spite of surgical intervention. This renders a need for a tool for evaluating the&#xD;
      functional outcome in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scintigraphic defecography examines the defecation in terms of the ability to empty the bowel&#xD;
      and examines the relocation of faeces within the bowel in relation to defecation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to explore the relation between scintigraphic defecography, type of surgery&#xD;
      performed and symptoms as evaluated by a disease specific questionnaire (Hirschsprung and&#xD;
      Anorectal Malformations Quality of Life Questionnaire).&#xD;

    <description>Disease specific questionnaire including sub scales for laxative and constipating diet, presence of diarrhoea and constipation, faecal and urinary incontinence, social and emotional functioning, body image, physical symptoms and sexual functioning. Each item is phrased as a multiple-choice question with four response options; never, once in a while, often and very often. Responses are linearly transformed on a 0-100 scale with a higher score indicating better QOL.</description>
