  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for subjects with untreated Stage IV small cell lung cancer. Subjects will be&#xD;
      given radiation therapy for five days, followed by standard of care chemo-immunotherapy&#xD;
      (etoposide + carboplatin or cisplatin + durvalumab) for 4 cycles. Subjects may continue to&#xD;
      receive durvalumab after 4 cycles have been completed until disease progression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, open-label, single-arm pilot phase II study of non-ablative&#xD;
      stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in combination with standard-of-care&#xD;
      chemo-immunotherapy in patients with untreated, extensive-stage (Stage IV) small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer. Subjects will be treated with etoposide plus platinum (carboplatin or cisplatin)&#xD;
      chemotherapy together with the PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor durvalumab, which is a standard of&#xD;
      care in this disease setting. Subjects will also receive a total of 6 Gy of radiotherapy X 5&#xD;
      fractions targeting multiple sites of intrathoracic disease when feasible and starting on the&#xD;
      first day of the first cycle of chemo-immunotherapy; no further radiation will be planned&#xD;
      after this. The hypothesis of this study is that the addition of sub-ablative doses of&#xD;
      radiation to combination chemotherapy and immunotherapy will be safe and feasible and result&#xD;
      in improved outcomes for patients with treatment-naive, extensive-stage small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
