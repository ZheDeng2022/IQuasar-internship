  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cesarean scar pregnancy (CSP) is a rare ectopic pregnancy occurring in cesarean section of&#xD;
      previous cesarean delivery. The incidence of CSP was 1 in 1,800-2,216 of all deliveries&#xD;
      reported in 2006. However, the incidence of CSP is increasing worldwide, especially in China,&#xD;
      owing to the rapidly increasing rate of cesarean sections and second-child births since 2015.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CSP can lead to life-threatening complications, such as massive hemorrhage, uterine rupture,&#xD;
      and loss of fertility. Therefore, immediate termination of pregnancy is recommended once a&#xD;
      correct diagnosis is made. At present, there is still no standard treatment for CSP. Current&#xD;
      treatments mainly include medical and surgical interventions (uterine artery embolization,&#xD;
      suction curettage, local resection by hysteroscopy or laparoscopy, and hysterectomy). At our&#xD;
      hospital, local resection by hysteroscopy is widely used; however, uncontrollable hemorrhage&#xD;
      still occurs during treatment. It is of great importance to predict massive hemorrhage for&#xD;
      clinical decision making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Classically, transvaginal ultrasonography (TVUS) is the preferred imaging modality to&#xD;
      diagnose CSP. However, patient factors, such as obesity, presence of bowel gas, and pain,&#xD;
      combined with operator experience, may limit the usefulness of TVUS. Owing to excellent soft&#xD;
      tissue contrast, the capacity of multiple dimensional images, and an excellent anatomical&#xD;
      overview, MRI has become an important supplement to evaluate CSP and cesarean section scar&#xD;
      (CSS). Sagittal T2-weighted imaging can be used to clearly visualize the gestational sac (GS)&#xD;
      and the CSS of a CSP and show detailed features, including the type of CSP, the degree of CSS&#xD;
      weakness, and the relationship between the CSP and adjacent structures. Hoffmann et al.&#xD;
      studied 25 asymptomatic pregnant women who had undergone one previous cesarean section and&#xD;
      found that MRI showed good inter- and intra-rater reliability in measuring lower uterine&#xD;
      segment thickness with a low observer dependency. MRI is an additional diagnostic tool that&#xD;
      can be used to assess the lower uterine segment in women who have undergone previous cesarean&#xD;
      section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge, no previous studies have explored the relationship between MRI and&#xD;
      intraoperative massive hemorrhage in patients with CSP. The arm of this study was to&#xD;
      investigate the ability of clinical characteristics and MRI features to predict massive&#xD;
      hemorrhage during hysteroscopic treatment of CSP, and to aid the choice of treatment.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients were clinically diagnosed with CSP, which was confirmed by surgery and&#xD;
             pathological assessment. Patients underwent local resection by hysteroscopy between&#xD;
             January 2015 and June 2019 in our hospital. All patients underwent MRI within 3 days&#xD;
             before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  (1) twin pregnancy ; (2) preoperative methotrexate use; (3) previous incomplete CSP&#xD;
             resection performed at other hospitals; (4) Surgical failure with incomplete CSP&#xD;
             removal.&#xD;
