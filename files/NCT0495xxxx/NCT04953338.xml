  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This cohort study is a large population-based study in the UK to determine the risks of&#xD;
      comorbid mental health conditions (including depression, anxiety and other potential&#xD;
      psychological complications of vitiligo) in adults with vitiligo compared to controls and to&#xD;
      evaluate whether the relative risks may vary by different ethnicity.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study has two primary outcomes 1) Prevalence and incidence of mental health condtions in&#xD;
      people diagnosed with vitiligo compared to matched controls and 2) Primary care and secondary&#xD;
      healthcare utilisation in patients diagnosed with vitiligo and having a prevalent depressive&#xD;
      conditon compared to matched controls. In addition, the study examines risk of time off work&#xD;
      and unemployment in people diagnosed with vitiligo compared to matched controls.&#xD;
