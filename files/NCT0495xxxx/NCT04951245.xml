  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Instead of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has been&#xD;
      used for staging axillary lymph nodes in women suffering from early breast cancer, and&#xD;
      different tracer methods have various advantages as well as disadvantages. The study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of Ultrasound Guidance Combined With a Carbon&#xD;
      Nanoparticle Tracer Versus Indocyanine Green combined With a Carbon Nanoparticle Tracer for&#xD;
      the sentinel lymph node (SLN) procedure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized study enrolled 316 patients with cN0-1 breast cancer and 158 patients who&#xD;
      received SLN biopsy (SLNB) using either Ultrasound Guidance (n = 158) or Indocyanine Green (n&#xD;
      = 158) With a Carbon Nanoparticle Tracer. The study compared the identification rate, number&#xD;
      of SLNs, and detection time of SLNB and so on.&#xD;

    <description>1-ml carbon nanoparticle suspension(CNS) (China Food and Drug Administration approval H20041829, Lai Mei Pharmaceutical Co, Chongqing, China) which is sub cutaneously injected into the periareolar area. The breast is massaged for approximately 15 min so that the CNS is absorbed into the lymphatic duct.&#xD;
Ultrasound guidance:The investigators scribe a line on the axillary skin surface to locate the surgical incision. The investigators can find lymph nodes use the ultrasound diagnostic system. The investigators assesse the distance of the body surface to the lymph nodes by ultrasound to guide the depth of surgical incision. Ultrasound diagnostic system(TOSHIBA APLIO 400, Japan) is used for preoperative ultrasound positioning to locate lymph nodes.</description>

    <description>Initial location of the sentinel lymph nodes identified by ultrasound is performed by the surgeon before surgery. Sentinel lymph nodes are defined according to their anatomical location. The probe was moved from the upper outer quadrant of the breast to the axilla along the lymphatic drainage pathway. After careful examination, the lymph node anatomically closest to the breast in the area from the outer margin of the breast to the lateral edge of the pectoralis minor muscle was detected and marked. A line was drawn as a surgical incision site to identify the marked lymph nodes under ultrasound guidance.</description>
