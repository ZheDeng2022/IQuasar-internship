  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Guided tissue regeneration(GTR) uses membranous materials to shield gingival epithelial cells&#xD;
      and connective tissue cells which grow more rapidly, creating an effective closed space and&#xD;
      time for periodontal ligament cells with regenerative potential, so that new cementum is&#xD;
      formed on the root surface and periodontal ligament fibers are embedded, resulting in&#xD;
      regenerative healing. In order to improve the effect of periodontal regeneration therapy, as&#xD;
      early as 1990s, scholars began to mix platelet concentrate and bone graft in periodontal&#xD;
      regenerative surgery to improve the ability of local bone induction and tissue healing.&#xD;
      Studies have shown that platelet concentrate, which is rich in a variety of growth factors in&#xD;
      autologous blood, can promote soft tissue and bone tissue healing by acting on tissue healing&#xD;
      cells (osteoblasts, epithelial cells, connective tissue cells, etc.). It is closely related&#xD;
      to periodontal regeneration; the regenerative component of platelet concentrate, growth&#xD;
      factor, and the structure of fibrin network containing growth factor are the key to promote&#xD;
      tissue repair and regeneration.Modified platelet-rich fibrin (advanced platelet rich&#xD;
      fibrin,APRF) and concentrated growth factor (CGF) are the latest generation of platelet&#xD;
      concentrates. A number of studies have shown that APRF and CGF contain more cytokines, have a&#xD;
      denser fibrin network, and show stronger ability to promote the migration and proliferation&#xD;
      of gingival fibroblasts, suggesting that both of them may have better ability to promote bone&#xD;
      tissue healing. At present, the latest generation of platelet concentrate has been widely&#xD;
      used in implant surgery, but their clinical effects in periodontal regeneration surgery are&#xD;
      still lack of conclusive evidence. there is no report on comparing the clinical effects of&#xD;
      the two through randomized clinical controlled trials.&#xD;

Furthermore, the structure of alveolar bone was optimized by remeshing and smooth.
