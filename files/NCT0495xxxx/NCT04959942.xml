  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate efficacy of adding Scapular Stabilization Exercises&#xD;
      to postural correctional exercises on Endurance of cervical flexor and extensor muscles on&#xD;
      Asymptomatic forward head posture.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Forward head posture (FHP) is the most common deviation from ideal head posture and is&#xD;
      characterized by the head projecting forward into the sagittal plane such that it is anterior&#xD;
      to the trunk. Individuals with neck pain frequently demonstrate FHP, when compared to&#xD;
      age-matched controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asymmetric posture is a chronic stressor and the origin of most noxious stimuli that could&#xD;
      alleviate 70-90 % of chronic pain. It is reported that FHP is a common postural abnormality,&#xD;
      with a conservative estimate being 66 % of the patient population. It causes vertebral&#xD;
      displacement patterns, abnormal stresses, and strain on the spinal cord. FHP has adverse&#xD;
      mechanical tension on neural and vascular elements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is theorized that when muscle performance is impaired, the balance between the stabilizers&#xD;
      on the posterior aspect of the neck and the DNFs will be disrupted, resulting in loss of&#xD;
      proper alignment and posture, which is then likely to contribute to cervical Impairment (loss&#xD;
      of range of motion, or decreased strength including, but not limited to, the&#xD;
      sternocleidomastoid (SCM), trapezius, and deep neck flexor (DNF) muscles endurance of the&#xD;
      neck musculature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of DNF muscle performance properties is arguably important given the relationship&#xD;
      between DNF muscle torque and endurance deficits and patient complaints of head and neck&#xD;
      pain. sixty subjects with forward head posture assigned randomly to three groups.&#xD;
      experimental group 1 will receive scapular stabilization plus postural correction exercise&#xD;
      and advice, experimental group 2 will receive postural correction exercise plus advice and&#xD;
      finally control group will receive advice.&#xD;

    <description>In the supine position, the subject will instruct to take a deep breath to relax the body. In croock-lying position, the subject will raise his dominant arm to 90° shoulder flexion with full elbow extension and scapular protraction. In the quadruped position, the subject lifts up his arms alternatively with shoulder abduction and 120 ° flexion. In a sitting position with 90° knee flexion on a stool or bed without back support, the subject held a pair of dumbbells (2 kg) in each hand and laterally lifted them up while maintaining the height of scapulae below 80°. Each stage will instruct to be held for 10 seconds before returning to the starting position and three laps of 10 repetitions with a 30-second break in between will perform. In the sitting position, a mirror will place in front of the patient. The subject will instruct to check and correct his posture by him</description>
