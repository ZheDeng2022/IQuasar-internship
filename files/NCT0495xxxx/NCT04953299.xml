  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rise in obesity over the last two decades has led to an increased need to support&#xD;
      individuals to lose weight but also reduce costs for healthcare settings. A review of group&#xD;
      interventions for those with severe obesity concluded that group interventions are not only&#xD;
      cost effective but also have good outcomes in terms of weight loss. A systematic review of&#xD;
      individual and group based interventions for treating obesity found that group interventions&#xD;
      were more effective but that the domain needed to be further explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional Imagery Training is a theoretically informed intervention that utilises client's&#xD;
      intrinsic motivation to elicit effective behaviour change. It has drawn upon aspects of&#xD;
      motivational interviewing and the use of imagery to develop an intervention that has been&#xD;
      effective in many aspects including maintained weight loss when used on a 1:1 basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a Randomised Control Trial to test group-based delivery of FIT&#xD;
      using the virtual platform Zoom versus the NHS 12 week online program as the current standard&#xD;
      of what individuals seeking to lose weight can access independently.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In England two thirds of the population are overweight, as defined by a body mass index (BMI)&#xD;
      of 25 kg/m2 or more and nearly half of these have obesity as defined by a BMI of 30 kg/m-2 or&#xD;
      more. Subsequently healthcare costs increase alongside the increasing prevalence of obesity&#xD;
      and overweight with approximately 1.8% of the National Health Services (NHS) government&#xD;
      budget and around 7.1% of all deaths being attributed to elevated BMI in 2014. Alongside the&#xD;
      increased health risk associated with obesity, perceived quality of life declines also with&#xD;
      increasing BMI. Tackling the obesity epidemic could therefore lead to better physical and&#xD;
      mental health amongst a high proportion of the population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rise in obesity over the last two decades has led to an increased need to support&#xD;
      individuals to lose weight but also reduce intervention costs. A review of group&#xD;
      interventions for tier 3 services (severe obesity/ those with co-morbidities) found that&#xD;
      group interventions are a cost effective method of treatment which demonstrate good results&#xD;
      in terms of weight loss. Including the role of behaviour change in weight management is vital&#xD;
      in ensuring the adoption and maintenance of new, long term skills which will help support&#xD;
      maintaining weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional Imagery Training (FIT) is a theoretically informed intervention that utilises&#xD;
      clients' intrinsic motivation and mental imagery to elicit effective behaviour change. It&#xD;
      uses the well- established, person-centred approach of motivational interviewing. The mental&#xD;
      imagery exercises are designed to strengthen motivation, consolidate plans for change, and&#xD;
      build the person's confidence that they can succeed. Research demonstrates the emotive power&#xD;
      of mental imagery and the shift from short-term rewards to longer term goals. Delivered face&#xD;
      to face, one-to-one, FIT has been shown to elicit behaviour changes to support weight loss&#xD;
      over a sustained period of 12 months. The investigators conducted a randomised controlled&#xD;
      trial of one-to-one FIT compared to motivational interviewing which demonstrated those in the&#xD;
      FIT group experienced greater weight loss at 6 months post-allocation compared to the&#xD;
      motivational interview group and continued weight loss for the FIT group only at 12m, 6&#xD;
      months after intervention ended. There is a need to establish if FIT remains efficacious and&#xD;
      cost-effective when delivered to groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a randomised control trial to test group-based delivery of FIT&#xD;
      using the virtual platform Zoom. The current climate surrounding the increased need for&#xD;
      remote-accessed services has allowed the investigators to explore the potential use of FIT&#xD;
      online. There are many benefits to remote access interventions including reduced costs and&#xD;
      travel time for the patients, more convenience and flexibility for patients and the reduced&#xD;
      amount of clinic time for practitioners and patients.&#xD;
