  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with recurrent or metastatic renal cell carcinoma, a preliminary evaluation of&#xD;
      the safety and efficacy of sintilimab combined with axitinib in patients with advanced renal&#xD;
      cell carcinoma was conducted.Progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), disease&#xD;
      control rate (DCR) and disease remission rate (ORR) were evaluated.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with recurrent or metastatic renal cell carcinoma received axitinib tablets (5mg bid&#xD;
      po) combined with sintilimab (200mg d1) on a 3-week (21-day) as a one-cycle regimen.6 months&#xD;
      of continuous administration (i.e., 8 cycles of sintilimab) or until tumor progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity or death or subject withdraws informed consent;If the drug has been&#xD;
      discontinued or the tumor has progressed, and there are no intolerable side effects, the drug&#xD;
      can be continued according to the judgment of the researchers and the will of the subjects.&#xD;
      Drug safety was evaluated before each cycle.The first efficacy was evaluated after 2&#xD;
      cycles.The efficacy was then evaluated every 2 cycles.&#xD;
