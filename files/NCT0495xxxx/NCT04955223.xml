    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized single arm clinical study to observe the effect of Yinhu Qingwen&#xD;
      Granule in the relief of fever and improvement of related-symptoms of patients with viral&#xD;
      pneumonia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preliminary pharmacodynamic and toxicological studies can show that Yinhu Qingwen Granule has&#xD;
      a certain effect on pneumonia caused by various viruses, and its safety is good. This study&#xD;
      aims to observe the effect of Yinhu Qingwen Granule in the relief of fever and improvement of&#xD;
      related-symptoms of patients with viral pneumonia.&#xD;
