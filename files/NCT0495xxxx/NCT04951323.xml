  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study is a prospective phase IV study. All participants will receive the&#xD;
      anti-Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Vaccine (messenger Ribonucleic acid-based vaccine,&#xD;
      BNT162b2 or Comirnaty®, commercialized by Pfizer-BioNTech) being authorized in the European&#xD;
      Union since December 2020. The vaccine is administered intramuscularly after dilution as a&#xD;
      series of two doses at least 21 days apart.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The central question is whether allo-hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) recipients&#xD;
      can develop protective immunity against COVID-19 upon vaccination. This question needs to be&#xD;
      answered urgently and would help the hematologist to provide recommendation / best treatment&#xD;
      for these patients. In this pilot project Cov-Allo, this important question will be addressed&#xD;
      in a cohort in which allo-HCT recipients will be vaccinated with the mRNA available COVID-19&#xD;
      vaccine according to the Belgian vaccination program. The primary objective is to assess&#xD;
      immune response after administration of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 (Comirnaty®;&#xD;
      Pfizer-BioNTech) in a population of 50 patients allo-HCT recipients. This number is based on&#xD;
      the availabilities of vaccines and eligible patients. Moreover, as the study is observational&#xD;
      and exploratory, no sample size calculation could be provided for this study.&#xD;
