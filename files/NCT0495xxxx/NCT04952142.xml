  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Minimal water exchange colonoscopy is theoretically more convenient and faster than water&#xD;
      exchange colonoscopy. But few studies compared the differences between the two methods.&#xD;
      Therefore, we attempted to evaluate the effect of minimal water exchange colonoscopy&#xD;
      prospectively.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients aged 18 to 75 years for unsedated colonoscopy for colorectal cancer&#xD;
             screening, polyp surveillance, or polyp resection were enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who underwent sedation or analgesia before colonoscopy, and were reluctant to&#xD;
             cooperate or provide informed consent. Those who were suffering from too serious&#xD;
             diseases to tolerate the examination. The intestinal segment was incomplete or the&#xD;
             colonoscopy did not reach the cecum.&#xD;
