        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Adult male or female subjects, 18 to 75 years of age at time of informed consent who&#xD;
             have been on maintenance HD 3 times a week for at least 3 months prior to signing&#xD;
             informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Must receive HD 3 times a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Target post-dialysis body weight &lt; 125 kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Have laboratory parameters at Screening as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Serum albumin ≥ 3.0 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Blood hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Serum liver transaminases (alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate&#xD;
                  aminotransferase [AST]) &lt; 2× the upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Have adequate single pool urea (Kt/V ≥ 1.2) for the 2 consecutive readings in the&#xD;
             months preceding the Screening Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects will not be allowed to start any new medications during the study period&#xD;
             (i.e., from treatment assignment to the follow-up visit) except in case of a medical&#xD;
             emergency (the subject may be removed from the study accordingly as decided by the&#xD;
             Principal Investigator [PI] and sponsor).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects should be on stable doses of medications for at least 2 weeks preceding&#xD;
             check-in to the research unit except medications used to manage co-morbidities&#xD;
             associated with dialysis, e.g., Epogen, vitamin D analogs, and Venofer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Women of childbearing potential will not be breast feeding and must have a negative&#xD;
             serum pregnancy test at Screening and Day -1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Women of childbearing potential must use 2 forms of effective birth control (at least&#xD;
             one barrier method) during the study and for 31 days after end of infusion. Men will&#xD;
             be required to use condoms for the duration of study and for 7 days after study&#xD;
             discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. In the opinion of the investigator, the subject is capable of understanding and&#xD;
             complying with the protocol. Subjects must have signed and dated the ICF prior to&#xD;
             performance of any study related procedure including Screening procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Must be receiving HD via an arterio-venous fistula or an arterio-venous graft with no&#xD;
             access procedure performed within 1 month prior to receiving study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects treated with the cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) inhibitors ciprofloxacin&#xD;
             (Cipro®) or fluvoxamine (Luvox®) within 14 days prior to anticipated first dose of&#xD;
             study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Ongoing infections or the use of anti-infective medications within 2 weeks prior to&#xD;
             Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. History of previous organ transplant or known liver disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Have ongoing drug abuse/dependence (including alcohol) or recent history (within the&#xD;
             past 5 years) of, or treatment for, alcohol or drug abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Positive serum test for alcohol at Screening or on Day -1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Positive drugs of abuse test at Screening (serum) or on Day -1 (saliva).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Current smokers who smoke &gt; 5 cigarettes a day (serum cotinine levels ≥ 10 ng/mL) are&#xD;
             excluded. Note: Cotinine is tested at Screening only. Every effort should be made to&#xD;
             recruit nonsmokers; at least 8 subjects in this study should be nonsmokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subjects with an active malignancy, suspicion of active malignancy by history or&#xD;
             physical examination, or history of solid, metastatic, or hematologic malignancy with&#xD;
             the exception of basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has been removed.&#xD;
