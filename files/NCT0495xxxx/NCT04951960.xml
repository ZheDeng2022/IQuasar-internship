  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patient-ventilator asynchrony is known to frequently occur during lung protective ventilation&#xD;
      in patients with ARDS. Previous clinical studies showed that patient-ventilator asynchrony&#xD;
      was associated with worse outcome in ICU. Therefore, strategies to reduce patient-ventilator&#xD;
      asynchrony need to be established promptly. Several asynchronies, e.g., breath stacking are&#xD;
      caused by vigorous spontaneous breathing effort. Recently, the investigators' group found&#xD;
      that higher positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) reduced the intensity of spontaneous&#xD;
      breathing effort of in severe ARDS model (rabbits, pigs) and patients with ARDS. Thus, the&#xD;
      investigators conjectured that higher PEEP may reduce the intensity of spontaneous breathing&#xD;
      effort and thereby reduce patient-ventilator asynchrony during protective ventilation&#xD;
      strategy, compared with lower PEEP in patients with ARDS.&#xD;

      The cross-over study will enroll 10 participants fulfilled with the criteria of Berlin&#xD;
      definition of moderate-to-severe ARDS and under mechanical ventilation in intensive care unit&#xD;
      (ICU) at Osaka University Hospital. Informed consent will be obtained by legal&#xD;
      representatives. After obtaining informed consent, participants will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      one of two groups: &quot;higher PEEP - lower PEEP&quot; or &quot;lower PEEP - higher PEEP&quot;. PEEP, either&#xD;
      higher or lower, will be set according to higher or lower PEEP/FIO2 table. The depth of&#xD;
      sedation will be monitored quantitively and maintained to be the same throughout the&#xD;
      protocol. The intensity of spontaneous breathing activity will be assessed with esophageal&#xD;
      balloon manometry and electrical activity of diaphragm. At each PEEP setting, asynchrony&#xD;
      index will be calculated.&#xD;
