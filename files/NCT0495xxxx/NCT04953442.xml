  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of a goal-setting intervention that&#xD;
      utilizes a Fitbit device and text messaging to improve physical activity and sleep in&#xD;
      Hispanic adolescents with obesity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hispanic adolescents are disproportionately burdened by obesity and type 2 diabetes compared&#xD;
      to non-Hispanic white youth. Disparities in T2D emerge early in life and are driven in part&#xD;
      by unhealthy lifestyle behaviors including low levels of physical activity, excessive time&#xD;
      spent in sedentary behaviors and short sleep durations. Given that Hispanic youth are the&#xD;
      fastest growing pediatric subgroup in the U.S., developing strategies to promote healthy&#xD;
      lifestyle behaviors and addressing T2D disparities is a public health imperative. Wearable&#xD;
      activity monitoring devices like Fitbits are designed to continuously monitor both wake time&#xD;
      and sleep behaviors. Therefore the purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility,&#xD;
      acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a 12-week technology-based intervention that uses&#xD;
      a Fitbit and text messages grounded in the Self-Determination Theory to promote healthy&#xD;
      lifestyle habits and reduce risk for type 2 diabetes among a Hispanic adolescents with&#xD;
      obesity.&#xD;

    <description>This 12-week goal-setting intervention will test the feasibility of using a Fitbit watch and motivational text messaging to improve physical activity and sleep in Hispanic youth (14-16 years of age) with obesity. Youth will be prompted to set weekly steps per day and hours of sleep per night goals. Text messages will be grounded in the Self-Determination Theory and will provide evidence-based strategies, support, and motivation to encourage youth to meet their goals.</description>
