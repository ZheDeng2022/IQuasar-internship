        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must have received gRV-GT as part of a clinical trial, expanded access program, as&#xD;
        an approved product (Strimvelis) or under a post-approval hospital exemption, and must have&#xD;
        at least one retained biological sample that meets the following eligibility criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Peripheral blood, bone marrow, or DNA extracted from either source.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Taken at least 6 months after gRV-GT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Stored at -20oC or below since the time of sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Likely to provide at least 1.5 Î¼g of DNA (following extraction by the central&#xD;
             laboratory).&#xD;
&#xD;
        There is no restriction on the number of samples from a single subject, or on the time that&#xD;
        has elapsed since sampling.&#xD;
