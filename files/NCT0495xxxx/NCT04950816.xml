  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A Mindfulness-Based Intervention (MBI), called &quot;.b,&quot; will be tailored to Youth Experiencing&#xD;
      Homelessness (YEH) by using focus group discussions, key informant interviews, and iterative&#xD;
      beta-testing with the Homeless Youth Working Group (HYWG). The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      assess the feasibility and acceptability of this tailored MBI in YEH (the tailored MBI called&#xD;
      .b will be compared to an attention control condition). The results of this feasibility study&#xD;
      will inform the design of a future randomized controlled trial that will aim to test the&#xD;
      efficacy of the intervention for improving stress management, increasing emotional&#xD;
      regulation, decreasing impulsivity in YEH.&#xD;

    <description>The Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) is a computerized measure of risk taking behavior. Each click causes the balloon to incrementally inflate and money to be added to a counter up until some threshold, at which point the balloon is over inflated and explodes. The primary score used to measure BART performance is the adjusted average number of pumps on unexploded balloons, with higher scores indicative of greater risk-taking propensity</description>

    <description>The session will include brief didactic presentations, videos, and mindfulness practice followed by inquiry. We anticipate that sessions will take place twice a week. Sessions will be held on site at the Covenant House Texas (CHT) shelter in a quiet, designated learning space to ease access to sessions for the participants and to assure access to shelter staff (e.g., social workers and case managers) and services (e.g., food and shelter). CHT has onsite, weekday clinical and mental health care and established protocols for accessing needed resources 24/7. Selection criteria for the interventionist include maintaining a personal mindfulness practice for at least two years, trained in .b, and prior experience working with high-risk youth. The interventionist will receive additional training in Trauma-Informed Care as well as study procedures.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive no training in MBI or meditation. Topics covered may include physical activity, nutrition, managing weight, understanding adolescence, personal care, avoiding tobacco, alcohol, and drugs though this will be finalized in YR-1 with the HYWG and advisory panel. The HT program will be led by a positive adult instructor with training in health education or a related field and experience working with YEH.</description>
