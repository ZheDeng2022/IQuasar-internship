  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date, the prevalence of Hypertension (HPT) is getting increase worldwide. This situation&#xD;
      is contributed mostly by the Lower-Income Countries (LIC) and Lower-Middle-Income Countries&#xD;
      (LMICs) include Asians. Elevated Blood Pressure (EBP) in the early phase is often unrealized&#xD;
      before developing to HPT, leading to several diseases in terms of cardiovascular diseases&#xD;
      (CVDs). In preventing EBP, the European Society of Cardiology in 2017 classifies blood&#xD;
      pressure into three groups; normal, pre-hypertension, and hypertensive crisis. People in the&#xD;
      normal phase with the high-normal line are classified into EBP. If this group is determined&#xD;
      and controlled, they will further keep in normal blood pressure. Contrarily, they are&#xD;
      experiencing the next phase of HPT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Like other Asian countries, Indonesia was experiencing an extreme prevalence of HPT, and&#xD;
      Aceh, which is one of the provinces in Indonesia has a very high prevalence of HPT as well&#xD;
      (20% increment from 2013-2018), is estimated to equal to the EBP prevalence. Despite many&#xD;
      promotive and preventive interventions confirmed to decrease HPT, early screening has been&#xD;
      convinced to recover the HPT in Indonesia. However, the HPT prevalence was examined steadily&#xD;
      increasing. Intermittent fasting (IF) is recognized as a new method in decreasing metabolic&#xD;
      factors based on several types of research currently. Therefore, the investigators are&#xD;
      studying the effectiveness of intermittent fasting on people with EBP. Conducting healthy&#xD;
      lifestyle intervention that is inexpensive, doable, and easily accessible, would be a new&#xD;
      method for controlling EBP.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness of three months intermittent fasting&#xD;
      intervention followed by three months maintenance phase in stabilizing blood pressure among&#xD;
      the EBP group with the high-normal signal. This trial will conducts in Aceh, Indonesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In the beginning, the researcher chooses the allocation group for either intervention or&#xD;
           control group based on the potential number of workers from each department. Based on&#xD;
           that, it was decided that the intervention group is the Governor's office, and the Aceh&#xD;
           Besar regency secretariat is the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Letters of permission are submitted to both departments and continued by blood pressure&#xD;
           screening once it is approved. Hence, the enumerators will screen all the workers. Each&#xD;
           eligible participant (EBP 130-139/85-89 mm Hg and BMI ³ 25 kilograms/m2) will be invited&#xD;
           to join blood pressure plus nutrition class on the day after, and fulfill the baseline&#xD;
           characteristic questionnaire once they sign the informed consent. During the class, the&#xD;
           researcher will describe the study procedure, study objective, process, monitoring,&#xD;
           follow-up, methodology, risk and benefit, confidentiality, anonymity, and withdrawal&#xD;
           from the study in both groups with the different context of intervention. Because of the&#xD;
           covid-19 pandemic, all participants are allocated in a few small groups during baseline&#xD;
           training.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The participants will join complete anthropometric measurements and fulfill questions in&#xD;
           the STEP instrument and GPAQ instrument. Four enumerators will assist the participants;&#xD;
           however, they will be blinded to intervention assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The intervention group will undergo two fasting days and five ad libitum days during the&#xD;
           intervention phase and continued to the maintenance phase. Otherwise, the control group&#xD;
           will have a usual diet before the trial. Furthermore, both groups will have current&#xD;
           exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Calculation of the actual sample size to detect effect size in the primary and secondary&#xD;
           objectives of the project has been conducted. Sample selection techniques will be&#xD;
           described further in the published paper.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. A mixed linear model will be applied to count the intervention effects (blood pressure,&#xD;
           body weight, body mass index, waist circumference, and calorie intake), while a&#xD;
           generalized estimating equation (GEE) will be used as well for categorical outcomes.&#xD;
           Characteristics at baseline will be summarised by each arm using numbers and&#xD;
           percentages, means and standard deviations or medians, and inter-quartile ranges where&#xD;
           applicable.&#xD;
