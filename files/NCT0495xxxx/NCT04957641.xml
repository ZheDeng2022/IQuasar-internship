  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is about teenagers and adults with hereditary angioedema (HAE) type I and type II.&#xD;
      In this study, the burden of illness means the impact of HAE in terms of long-term health&#xD;
      outcomes and the financial cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aims of this study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to learn how often, how severe and where on the body HAE attacks occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to describe how HAE prophylaxis and on-demand medicines are prescribed and used.&#xD;
           (Prophylaxis medicines prevent a bleed from happening and on-demand medicines treat a&#xD;
           bleed when it occurs.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is about collecting data only; participants will not receive treatment as part of&#xD;
      this study. Existing data available in the participant's medical records will be collected.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to complete an electronic questionnaire either on a website or by&#xD;
      using an app on their mobile phone; data from this questionnaire will also be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants do not need to visit their doctor in addition to their normal visits.&#xD;

    <measure>Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL): Angioedema Quality of Life (AE-QoL) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Throughout the study period (up to 6 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The AE-QoL was developed to measure HRQoL in participants with recurrent angioedema. It is a self-administered patient-reported outcome instrument with a recall period of four weeks. There are 17 items across four domains: functioning (four items), fatigue/mood (five items), fears/shame (six items), and food (two items). Responses use a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (Never) to 5 (Very Often). Global scores range from 0 to 100 and scores by domains range from 0 to 100. An overall score is calculated and a higher score indicates lower quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>HRQoL: EuroQoL Group 5-Dimension 5-Level (EQ-5D-5L) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Throughout the study period (up to 6 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L descriptive system assesses health in five dimensions (Mobility, Self-Care, Usual Activities, Pain / Discomfort, Anxiety / Depression), each of which has five levels of response (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, extreme problems/unable to). This part of the EQ-5D questionnaire provides a descriptive profile that can be used to generate a health state profile. Health state index scores generally range from less than 0 (where 0 is the value of a health state equivalent to dead; negative values representing values as worse than dead) to 1 (the value of full health), with higher scores indicating higher health utility. The second part of the questionnaire consists of a visual analogue scale (VAS) on which the participant rates his/her perceived health from 0 (the worst imaginable health) to 100 (the best imaginable health).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>HRQoL: EuroQoL-five Dimensions, Youth Version (EQ-5D-Y)</measure>
    <time_frame>Throughout the study period (up to 6 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-Y is composed of two sections. The first section contains one question for each of the five dimensions: mobility, looking after myself, doing usual activities, having pain or discomfort, and feeling worried, sad, or unhappy. Participants select from three response levels (no problems, some problems, a lot of problems) for each dimension. A health state profile score can be calculated from the responses on these five questions. The second section includes the same visual analogue scale as the EQ-5D-5L. The scale is scored from 0-100. The reference to a high score indicates a better outcome of quality of life.</description>
