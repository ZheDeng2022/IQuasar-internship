    <textblock>
      The PURPOSE of this study is to see if eating almonds for four weeks will reduce muscle&#xD;
      damage, soreness, and inflammation during several days of recovery from eccentric exercise.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be the first study to determine if 4-weeks ingestion of nutrient-dense almonds&#xD;
      improves feelings of energy and vitality, and mitigates post-exercise inflammation (plasma&#xD;
      cytokine and oxylipin levels), muscle soreness, and muscle damage. An acute 90-minute bout of&#xD;
      eccentric exercise will be used to induce muscle damage and inflammation in a group of 60&#xD;
      relatively untrained male and female adults (ages 30-65 years). Using a randomized, parallel&#xD;
      group design, almond supplementation (57 g/d) for a 4-week period prior to the eccentric&#xD;
      exercise challenge will be investigated as a countermeasure strategy to exercise-induced&#xD;
      muscle damage and inflammation. The control group will ingest a calorie-matched common snack&#xD;
      (cereal bars). To improve the potential for capturing an intervention effect, advanced mass&#xD;
      spectrometry procedures will be utilized to measure changes in 70 different oxylipins and&#xD;
      lipid mediators that are involved in regulating inflammation. C-reactive protein (CRP), six&#xD;
      inflammatory cytokines, and muscle damage biomarkers will also be measured. Blood samples (7&#xD;
      total) will be collected before and after the 4-week supplementation period, and then daily&#xD;
      during 5 days of recovery from the eccentric exercise bout. The Profile of Mood States (POMS)&#xD;
      will be used to measure mood state and specific domains including vigor or activity, and&#xD;
      fatigue or inertia. Exercise performance will be measured each time a blood sample is&#xD;
      collected using a comprehensive battery that includes vertical jump, leg/back muscle&#xD;
      strength, bench press muscle endurance, and anaerobic power (30-second Wingate test).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to the almond or typical snack (cereal bars) supplement&#xD;
      groups. The parallel group design is being utilized in this study because of the &quot;repeat&#xD;
      exercise bout&quot; effect (i.e., post-exercise muscle damage and inflammation are reduced when&#xD;
      the same bout is repeated within days and weeks of the first bout). Participants will come to&#xD;
      the lab at 7:00 am at the beginning of the 4-week supplementation period, and then Monday&#xD;
      (eccentric exercise bout) and Tuesday through Friday (recovery) in an overnight fasted state.&#xD;
      The 4-week supplementation period was based on practical issues related to the research&#xD;
      design. A 4-week almond supplementation period was commonly used in prior studies and was&#xD;
      sufficient to demonstrate favorable blood lipid changes relative to control conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seven blood samples will be collected and analyzed for various measures of muscle damage,&#xD;
      oxylipins, and inflammation. After each of the blood draws, participants will complete the&#xD;
      POMS (energy, vitality) and provide a muscle soreness rating (DOMS). Physical activity will&#xD;
      be monitored during the entire study using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire&#xD;
      (IPAQ). The IPAQ was developed to measure health-related physical activity (PA) in&#xD;
      populations. The short version of the IPAQ has been tested extensively and is now used in&#xD;
      many international studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will come to the performance lab for orientation to the testing&#xD;
      procedures. This will include a review of the consent form, completion of basic&#xD;
      questionnaires, and an introduction to the eccentric muscle exercise bout and the&#xD;
      strength/power performance testing protocol (about 1.5 hours) (visit #1). This will be&#xD;
      followed by another lab session for pre-study measurements and sample collection with&#xD;
      subjects in an overnight fasted state (visit #2) (see description below). A 3-day food record&#xD;
      will be collected during the end of the 4-week supplementation period to assess the&#xD;
      background diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will have to agree to 5 other lab visits during a one-week period (all&#xD;
      overnight fasted condition). These lab visits will start at 7:00 am on Monday, with morning&#xD;
      visits at 7:00 am on Tuesday through Friday. At each of the 5 lab visits, study participants&#xD;
      will come to the lab at 7:00 am not having consumed food or beverages (other than water) for&#xD;
      at least the previous 9 hours, and having abstained from vigorous exercise for at least the&#xD;
      previous 24-48 hours. The Monday session will take about 2.5 hours (7:00 to 9:30 am), and the&#xD;
      Tuesday through Friday sessions will take about 30-45 minutes each. The total amount of time&#xD;
      participants will be asked to volunteer for this study is about 8-9 hours at the performance&#xD;
      lab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to almond or snack groups, and provided a 4-weeks supply of&#xD;
      supplements. Participants in the almond group will consume 57 g almonds each day in split&#xD;
      doses (half in the morning, half in the afternoon). Participants in the snack group will&#xD;
      ingest a matched calorie, common snack bar in split doses (324 calories/day, Nutri-Grain&#xD;
      cereal bars, 120 kcal each).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The daily dose of almonds (57 g) and just under 3 Nutri-Grain cereal bars will provide a&#xD;
      distinct difference in nutrient intake. A serving of 57 g of almonds has 324 calories with 12&#xD;
      g of protein, 28 g of fat (17 g from monounsaturated, 6.6 g from polyunsaturated, 2.6 g from&#xD;
      saturated), 12 g of carbohydrates and 6.6 g of fiber, 160 mg total polyphenols, and&#xD;
      significant amounts of vitamin E (96% RDA), magnesium, manganese, copper, and other minerals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Testing (Visit #2) Participants will provide a blood sample using standard&#xD;
      phlebotomy procedures. Participants will also provide a spot urine sample, with instructions&#xD;
      to capture a mid-stream urine sample in a disposable urine cup. Spot urine samples provide&#xD;
      valid metabolite data as indicators of dietary intake. Height, body weight, and body&#xD;
      composition will be measured in a private section of the lab. Bioelectrical impedance (BIA)&#xD;
      using the seca BIA scale will be used to assess body composition (i.e., the percent of body&#xD;
      weight that is fat tissue) and body weight. Participants will remove shoes and socks and&#xD;
      stand with bare feet on the seca scale for about 7-10 seconds while grasping side rails with&#xD;
      your hands. Percent body fat will also be measured using the BodPod. Participants will sit&#xD;
      inside the BodPod with a tight-fitting swim suit for about 10 minutes while body fat is&#xD;
      calculated. The Profile of Mood States (POMS) will be administered. Delayed onset of muscle&#xD;
      soreness (DOMS) will be assessed using a 1-10 scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will perform some light exercises to warm up, followed by five muscle function&#xD;
      tests: vertical jump, bench press, leg-back strength, 60-yard shuttle run test, and anaerobic&#xD;
      power through the 30-second Wingate test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Vertical jump: Participants will first stand erect with the feet flat on the floor and&#xD;
           reach as high as possible with both arms and hands (standing reach height). Participants&#xD;
           will then squat down and jump as high as possible with one arm and hand, and tap the&#xD;
           measuring device on the Vertec vertical jump apparatus (jump height). This will be&#xD;
           repeated three times, with the best score recorded as the difference between the jump&#xD;
           and standing reach heights.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Bench press to exhaustion at 50%/75%: Participants will lie down supine on a bench, and&#xD;
           with spotters standing on either side attempt to bench press a weighted bar equal to 75%&#xD;
           (males) or 50% (females) body weight as many times as possible (to a metronome set at 60&#xD;
           beats/min or 30 lifts/min). The bar must touch a foam block on the chest lightly in the&#xD;
           down position, and the arms must be straight in the up position.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Leg-Back Strength: Leg/lower back strength will be assessed with a dynamometer. With the&#xD;
           legs slightly bent at the knee, participants will grasp a bar attached via a chain and a&#xD;
           force measuring device with straight arms, and then lift up with maximal effort for&#xD;
           several seconds. This will measure the isometric strength of both legs and back, and&#xD;
           will be repeated three times.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. 30-Second Wingate Cycling Test, Anaerobic Power: The Lode cycle ergometer will be&#xD;
           adjusted to the participant's body weight (7 watts per kilogram). After a warm up,&#xD;
           participants will sprint cycle at maximal speed for 30 seconds. The peak power and&#xD;
           average power will be recorded and adjusted to body weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. 60-Yard Shuttle Run Test: The shuttle run is a test of anaerobic speed endurance and&#xD;
           agility, in which participants run to 5 yards, 10 yards, 15 yards, there and back, for a&#xD;
           total of 60 yards. This is a ladder shuttle of progressing distances. Four marker cones&#xD;
           are placed 5 yards apart. The participant starts from one end, runs 5 yards and back to&#xD;
           the start, 10 yards and back, then 15 yards and finishes at the start line. A total of&#xD;
           60 yards is completed. The participant is required to touch the line with their hand at&#xD;
           each turn, and runs through the finish line, for a total of five touches. The time to&#xD;
           complete the test in seconds is recorded. The score is the best time of three trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing Sequence, Day of Eccentric Muscle Exercise (Monday) and 4-Days Recovery (Tuesday&#xD;
      through Friday):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will come to the lab at 7:00 am in an overnight fasted state (i.e., no food or&#xD;
      beverages other than water for at least the previous 9 hours). Participants (on Monday only)&#xD;
      will provide a spot urine sample that will be aliquoted, stored in a -80°C freezer, and then&#xD;
      sent to Metabolon (Durham, NC) for global metabolomics analysis (to capture metabolite shifts&#xD;
      related to almond ingestion). Participants will provide a blood sample, fill in the POMS, and&#xD;
      give a DOMS rating. The almond or snack supplements (half dose) will be consumed.&#xD;
      Participants will perform some light exercises to warm up, followed by five muscle function&#xD;
      tests (same as baseline): vertical jump, bench press, leg-back strength, 60-yard shuttle run&#xD;
      test, and anaerobic power through the 30-second Wingate test. Participants will take these&#xD;
      performance tests before and after the 90-minute eccentric muscle exercise bout, and each of&#xD;
      the following four mornings at the performance lab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After taking the five performance tests, participants will engage in 90-minutes of eccentric&#xD;
      exercise. This protocol induces significant muscle damage and soreness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately following exercise, participants will provide a muscle soreness rating and a&#xD;
      blood sample. Participants will then take the five muscle function tests. Participants will&#xD;
      ingest the supplements (half-dose) during the afternoon. Participants will return at 7:00 am&#xD;
      in an overnight fasted state four days in a row (Tuesday through Friday) after Monday's&#xD;
      eccentric exercise bout, and provide muscle soreness ratings and blood samples followed by&#xD;
      ingestion of the supplements (half dose). Following ingestion of the supplements,&#xD;
      participants will take the five muscle function tests. Participants will the second half dose&#xD;
      of the supplements in the afternoon (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday). On Friday morning,&#xD;
      participants will take the supplement (half dose) prior to the muscle function tests. During&#xD;
      this week of testing, participants will engage in normal training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood and urine samples will be analyzed for a panel of oxylipins, CRP and six cytokines,&#xD;
      three muscle damage markers (creatine kinase, myoglobin, LDH), and urine metabolites.&#xD;
