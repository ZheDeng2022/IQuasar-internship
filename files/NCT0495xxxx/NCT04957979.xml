  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medical care has improved greatly over the past 50 years. Treatments for most medical&#xD;
      conditions can help us lead longer and healthier lives, but there are still problems. Many&#xD;
      patients with two or more conditions see many different doctors and sometimes take more&#xD;
      medications than needed. These patients can feel lost and confused. In addition, non-medical&#xD;
      issues involving housing, food, transportation, employment, income, support from others, and&#xD;
      language barriers can have a large impact on our health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Minnesota, many primary care clinics are using a method called care coordination to&#xD;
      improve the health of patients who have a number of chronic diseases (some examples of&#xD;
      chronic diseases include diabetes, heart disease, asthma and depression). With care&#xD;
      coordination, a nurse in the clinic helps the various doctors, clinics, and specialists to&#xD;
      work together, in the interest of the patient. In some clinics, a social worker also helps&#xD;
      with care coordination. These social workers help with issues like housing, transportation,&#xD;
      or employment. Care coordination can help reduce patient confusion. It also can improve&#xD;
      health and lower patient burdens and costs of getting medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To help find out what types of care coordination are most successful, we are proposing a&#xD;
      study. Our plan is to track the health of patients receiving care coordination and compare&#xD;
      two types:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Care coordination done by a nurse or other clinic staff B. Care coordination where a&#xD;
      licensed social worker also assists the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we will measure many things, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Control of chronic conditions like diabetes, heart disease, asthma, and depression&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hospitalizations&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Emergency department visits&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Use of medications and diagnostic tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Use of specialty care&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. General health status&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Patient satisfaction and access to care&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Use of shared decision-making (where the doctor and the patient make treatment decisions&#xD;
           together)&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Patient burden (how much time and effort the patient spends trying to get healthy)&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Patients' out-of-pocket medical costs&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will be important to patients because it could reduce confusion and fragmented&#xD;
      care while improving all the items above. Those improvements will be more likely because this&#xD;
      project takes advantage of engagement with patients and others. We have four patient partners&#xD;
      who will help conduct the study and interpret and broadly share the results. The project was&#xD;
      developed with the input from patients, clinic leaders, people from state government, and&#xD;
      experts on health and quality care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By measuring a wide variety of outcomes for the adults receiving coordination services in&#xD;
      these clinics, we hope to identify the specific actionable information that will allow these&#xD;
      and other clinics to improve their services for these patients with complex needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the project, we will communicate our findings to clinics and health systems. As a&#xD;
      result, many people may receive better care.&#xD;
