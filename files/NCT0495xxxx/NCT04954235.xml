      An observational, retrospective, classic cohort study of adult patients hospitalized for&#xD;
      severe pneumonia with a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR will be carried out. The cohort&#xD;
      will be divided into two arms: a group of patients who received treatment with&#xD;
      anti-SARS-CoV-2 hyperimmune serum and a group of patients not exposed to the intervention&#xD;
      during hospitalization corresponding to the period prior to the approval of the&#xD;
      anti-hyperimmune serum SARS-CoV-2 for use. All patients will be have structured follow-up at&#xD;
      14, 21 and 28 days, until discharge or death.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A classic retrospective cohort observational study of adult patients hospitalized for severe&#xD;
      pneumonia with a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 will be conducted. The date of admission to the&#xD;
      cohort will be considered the date of admission. All patients will be followed with&#xD;
      structured evaluations at 14, 21 and 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cohort will be divided into two arms: a group of patients who received treatment with 2&#xD;
      infusions of 4 mg / Kg each of hyperimmune anti-SARS-CoV-2 serum (INM005, CoviFab®) separated&#xD;
      by 48 hours, from the date of approval for its use; and a group of patients not exposed to&#xD;
      said intervention during hospitalization corresponding to the period prior to the approval of&#xD;
      the hyperimmune anti-SARS-CoV-2 serum for its use. CoviFab® has been authorized under special&#xD;
      conditions by the Agency for Medicines, Food and Medical Technology (ANMAT) for the treatment&#xD;
      of hospitalized patients with moderate to severe disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus&#xD;
      (Regulation 9175/20, 22 December 2020)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study period that will be considered for the arm of patients exposed to anti-SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      polyclonal hyperimmune serum is between January 27, 2021 and April 9, 2021. The study period&#xD;
      to include patients not exposed to hyperimmune anti-SARS-CoV-2 serum is between September 1,&#xD;
      2020 to January 26, 2021. This last period was chosen because it is considered to be a time&#xD;
      when there were no substantive differences in the diagnosis, categorization of risk, support&#xD;
      measures or treatment of hospitalized adult patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19&#xD;
      pneumonia, and therefore corresponds to a valid period for comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the &quot;Escuela Hogar&quot; Hospital began operating in July 2020, it was decided to exclude&#xD;
      patients admitted for the first two months, considering that after two months of operation,&#xD;
      the diagnostic, treatment and support systems are stable for the comparison between exposed&#xD;
      and unexposed patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be carried out in a collaborative manner between the Acute Campaign Hospital&#xD;
      &quot;Escuela Hogar&quot; and the Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires, which will act as the coordinating&#xD;
      center for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Acute Campaign Hospital &quot;Escuela Hogar&quot; was designed and implemented to treat COVID-19&#xD;
      cases exclusively. It was inaugurated in July 2020 in the city of Corrientes, Argentine&#xD;
      Republic, with the aim of functioning as a diagnostic and treatment center for patients&#xD;
      affected by COVID-19 throughout the province of Corrientes[4].&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has a general hospitalization sector and a intensive care unit, with approximately 723&#xD;
      total beds available and 300 in the intensive care unit. The staff includes doctors, nurses&#xD;
      and health personnel, as well as technicians and administrators trained in the care of&#xD;
      patients affected by COVID-19. It has an Operations Center where the members of the Crisis&#xD;
      Committee monitor the entire building and access in real time, the status of patients and the&#xD;
      movement of that institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hospital is paper free, and has a Computerized Medical Record. This data repository has&#xD;
      additional information on patient admission, free text evolutions, structured indications,&#xD;
      vital sign registration and support, and results of imaging studies reports such as X-rays&#xD;
      and Tomography. The laboratory is in a different development that contains all the&#xD;
      laboratories performed on each patient in each episode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data processing and analysis will be carried out in the area of the Research Department&#xD;
      of the Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables Follow-up will be carried out with structured forms upon admission, days 14, 21 and&#xD;
      28. For the purposes of the study, we will include demographic variables (age, sex, BMI),&#xD;
      presence of comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, obesity, cancer, lung disease, liver&#xD;
      disease, kidney disease, coronary / cardiovascular disease), the history of having received&#xD;
      plasma in the previous 30 days or during hospitalization, the plasma dose, Charlson score;&#xD;
      related to the patient's diagnosis and their baseline status at admission (diagnostic method&#xD;
      , date of onset of symptoms, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, PaO2 / FiO2, oxygen&#xD;
      requirement, type of device indicated, NEWS score) and related to the evolution both in&#xD;
      hospitalization and after hospital discharge until day 28 from hospital admission (need for&#xD;
      supplemental oxygen, admission to mechanical ventilation, admission to ICU, clinical&#xD;
      improvement, disease progression, death, discharge).&#xD;
