      This study will deploy a multimodal pragmatic intervention to improve vaccine uptake in&#xD;
      priority populations through a proactive organized population-based outreach approach. It&#xD;
      will leverage health information technology with tailored navigation support to address&#xD;
      mistrust and social barriers. Study key objectives are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. conduct a survey of patients to assess and track barriers, intent, and sources of&#xD;
           information on COVID vaccine over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine whether a primary care physician (PCP) endorsement with or without interactive&#xD;
           digital communication plus navigation is more effective in promoting uptake of COVID-19&#xD;
           vaccine than general messages from the clinic. Patients will be randomized to one of&#xD;
           three arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Arm 1: Message about vaccine availability delivered by SMS advising patients to&#xD;
                make an appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Arm 2: Same as Arm 1 but delivered as a personalized message text from the PCP.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Arm 3: Same as Arm 2 plus a interactive 2-way SMS options.&#xD;
