  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial investigates the effect of olaparib in treating patients with castration&#xD;
      resistant prostate adenocarcinoma. Olaparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking&#xD;
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive olaparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID). Cycles repeat every 28 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up to 1 year.&#xD;
