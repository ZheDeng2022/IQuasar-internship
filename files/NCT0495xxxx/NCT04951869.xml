    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled trial was conducted for six months involving 90 women who underwent&#xD;
      caesarean section without any history of previous abdominal surgery and who were planning for&#xD;
      further pregnancy. They were randomized into two groups. The Protescal group was given&#xD;
      Protescal gel which was applied over the uterine incision site and subcutaneous tissue layer&#xD;
      prior to skin closure (n = 45), whereas in the control group, no Protescal gel was applied (n&#xD;
      = 45). The primary outcome was to assess the healing of the external scar.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Day 10th post caesarean section</time_frame>
    <description>Wound healing assessed on 10th-day post caesarean section using REEDA scale of which the criteria assessed include redness, edema, ecchymosis, discharge and approximation. The REEDA Scale (Redness, Edema, Ecchymosis, Discharge, Approximation) scale assesses the inflammation process and tissue healing. The minimum score is 0 and the maximum score is 15; whereby the higher the score denotes the more severe the tissue trauma and healing outcome.Percentage of patients in both groups with REEDA Scale scores of 0, 1-2 and â‰¥ 3 is determined.</description>

    <time_frame>3 months post caesarean section</time_frame>
    <description>Third-month post-caesarean section, the degree of scarring was assessed using the Modified Vancouver scar scale (MVSS) which assessed pigmentation, height, pliability and vascularity of the scar. This scale focused on six parameters including scar height and thickness, pliability, vascularity, pigmentation, symptoms of itch and pain to generate a score ranging from 0 to 18 points.For the purpose of this study, a hypertrophic scar (HTS) was defined as one which was raised by at least 2 mm and had a total MVSS of 5 points or more (4). Thus a higher score would means a more hypertrophic scar formation. If a patient had more than one MVSS recorded during their follow up, the highest value was used.</description>

    <time_frame>3 months post caesarean section</time_frame>
    <description>Third-month post-caesarean section, the degree of scarring was assessed by colour photography if deemed necessary for comparison purposes. This would also depend on patient's agreement to her scar being photographed. If agreeable and deemed necessary, thus a patient's assessment was supplemented with colour photographs for later review and comparison.</description>

    <description>Caesarean-section was done in the usual manner. The transverse suprapubic skin incision was made and abdominal layers opened as usual. After delivering the baby, uterine muscle is closed in two layers with braided absorbable suture, polyglactin 910 (Vicryl no 1). After hemostasis secure, 1 mL Protescal gel was applied at the uterine suture site in Protescal group. Peritoneal layer closed using braided absorbable suture, polyglactin 910 (Vicryl no 1). Rectus sheath was sutured using braided absorbable suture, polyglactin 910 (Vicryl no 1). Subcutaneous tissue closed interruptedly using braided absorbable suture, polyglactin 910 (Vicryl no 1). Protescal gel (0.5 mL) was applied over the subcutaneous tissue prior to skin closure in Protescal group. The skin was then closed with the subcuticular method using braided absorbable suture, polyglactin 910 (Vicryl 3-0).</description>
