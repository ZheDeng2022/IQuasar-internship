    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical study, CLO-SCB-2019-010, is to assess the immunogenicity,&#xD;
      reactogenicity and safety of the SCB-2019 vaccine in Chinese participants, and to show the&#xD;
      comparability of the immune response versus randomly selected individuals who participated in&#xD;
      the large-scale efficacy study with the SCB-2019 vaccine (Study CLO-SCB-2019-003).&#xD;

             requiring major change for specific past medical condition, not receive surgery or&#xD;
             minimal invasive medical intervention, and without hospitalization or ER visit during&#xD;
             the 3 months before enrollment.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Female participants of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study, if the&#xD;
             participant has practiced adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, and&#xD;
             has a negative pregnancy test on the day of vaccination and has agreed to continue&#xD;
             adequate contraception for 6 months after the last vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Male participants must agree to employ acceptable contraception from the day of the&#xD;
             first dose of the study vaccine/placebo until 6 months after the last dose of the&#xD;
             study vaccine/placebo and also refrain from donating sperm during this period.&#xD;
&#xD;

             within 3 days prior to randomization. Participants meeting this criterion may be&#xD;
