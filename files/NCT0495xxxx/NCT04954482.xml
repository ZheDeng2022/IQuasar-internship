      Objective: (1) To establish a III°PCL injury model on fresh cadaver knee specimens, and to&#xD;
      define the pathological and anatomical connotation of III°PCL injury by using anatomical&#xD;
      methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (2) To explore and establish combined reconstruction techniques, including PCL reconstruction&#xD;
      combined with injury repair and reconstruction, and to explore the role of combined&#xD;
      reconstruction techniques in maintaining knee stability through biomechanical experiments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: ① The subjects of this study were fresh cadaver knee specimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Anatomical study of injury model, planning 6 cases. B. Exploration of treatment methods for&#xD;
      complicated injuries. 8 cases of specimens are planned to be used. According to the&#xD;
      pathological and anatomical content of III°PCL injury (IKDC standard), the repair and&#xD;
      reconstruction techniques of combined injury were designed. Arthroscopic transtibial&#xD;
      single-bundle PCL reconstruction technique was used in all the reconstruction of PCL. Using&#xD;
      the robotic arm or universal sensor test system as the biomechanical test platform,&#xD;
      Biomechanical tests were carried out on the experimental specimens, and the results were&#xD;
      compared to determine the shortcomings of the new PCL reconstruction, according to which the&#xD;
      surgical procedures were improved, and then the biomechanical tests were carried out. After&#xD;
      repeated technical improvement (4 cycles, 2 specimens per cycle), the new PCL reconstruction&#xD;
      technique was finally determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C To investigate the effect of new PCL reconstruction in maintaining the stability of knee&#xD;
      joint, 8 cases were treated with a specimen plan. Biomechanical tests were performed on each&#xD;
      specimen in its intact state, post-traumatic state (after the establishment of the III°PCL&#xD;
      injury model), and post-traumatic state (after the application of the new PCL reconstruction&#xD;
      technology) using the robotic arm/universal sensor test system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome evaluation: The biomechanical characteristics of knee specimens under different&#xD;
      conditions were measured, compared and statistically analyzed, and the conclusions were&#xD;
      drawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multivariate linear analysis model and Bonferroni multiple comparison were used to&#xD;
           compare the kinematics changes of knee joints under various loading conditions and knee&#xD;
           flexion angles under the condition of knee joint integrity, III°PCL injury, PCL&#xD;
           reconstruction, and combined injury treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Univariate repeated measure ANOVA was used to compare the knee joint integrity,&#xD;
                III°PCL injury, the stability of the knee joint after PCL reconstruction, and the&#xD;
                stability of the knee joint after combined injury treatment (including the back&#xD;
                drawer test and stress radiograph measurement).&#xD;
