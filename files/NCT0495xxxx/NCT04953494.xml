      This study will establish a comprehensive exon database of ALS patients, lay the foundation&#xD;
      for screening the genes related to the occurrence and development of the disease, support the&#xD;
      theory of ALS disease progression from peripheral to central, and reveal the correlation&#xD;
      between the functional level of peripheral nerve and the prognosis of the disease at the gene&#xD;
      level for the first time, and provide the basis for the mechanism research at the molecular&#xD;
      level.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that selectively&#xD;
      invades superior and inferior motor neurons. Because there is no effective treatment, it is&#xD;
      urgent to find the risk factors of ALS to guide the prevention and slow down the disease&#xD;
      progression. In the early stage of the disease, the peripheral motor injury is more rapid and&#xD;
      sensitive than the central response, which is an ideal window to observe the state of the&#xD;
      disease. Protecting peripheral nerve integrity and maintaining its function can slow down the&#xD;
      death of superior neurons, effectively relieve symptoms and prolong survival time, which has&#xD;
      also been confirmed in patients with multiple stem cell-derived motor neurons and SOD1 G93A&#xD;
      disease model mice. Reexamination of the role of peripheral motor nerve related factors in&#xD;
      the development of ALS is of great significance for the study of disease mechanism, clinical&#xD;
      classification, prognosis, evaluation of drug trial efficacy and individualized treatment&#xD;
      plan. Previous studies have shown that NEFL gene, as the coding gene of light chain of neuron&#xD;
      cytoskeleton, is closely related to axonal function, and its polymorphism is related to the&#xD;
      occurrence and severity of axonal Charcot Marie Tooth disease. Exploring the role of similar&#xD;
      peripheral nerve related genes in the progression of ALS will help us better understand the&#xD;
      disease from the genetic level, establish an accurate and stable prognosis prediction model,&#xD;
      and guide early treatment. This study will establish a comprehensive exon database of ALS&#xD;
      patients, lay the foundation for screening the genes related to the occurrence and&#xD;
      development of the disease, support the theory of ALS disease progression from peripheral to&#xD;
      central, and reveal the correlation between the functional level of peripheral nerve and the&#xD;
      prognosis of the disease at the gene level for the first time, and provide the basis for the&#xD;
      mechanism research at the molecular level.&#xD;
