      Tissue perfusion assessment is key to more accurate measurement of foot ischemia, which is in&#xD;
      turn an important factor in appropriate treatment decisions. In practice though, tissue&#xD;
      perfusion measurements are not routinely undertaken as few practical solutions exist that are&#xD;
      easy to use and fit in everyday clinical practice. Pedra has developed a novel easy to use,&#xD;
      non-invasive device that can be used in practice to better inform treatment decisions.&#xD;

      Tissue perfusion assessment is key to more accurate measurement of foot ischemia, which is in&#xD;
      turn an important factor in appropriate treatment decisions. In practice though, tissue&#xD;
      perfusion measurements are not routinely undertaken as few practical solutions exist that are&#xD;

      non-invasive device that can be used in practice to better inform treatment decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a feasibility study to demonstrate the ability of the Xauron system to track tissue&#xD;
      perfusion changes in patients undergoing endovascular intervention for the treatment of&#xD;
      peripheral artery disease (PAD). The findings of this study are for research purposes and&#xD;
      will also be used to help with the future education of physicians about the potential use of&#xD;
      the Xauron system. In addition, this early pilot data will be used to help power larger, more&#xD;
      definitive studies relating to the intra-procedural use of the Xauron system.&#xD;

        This is a prospective, multi-center, observational, feasibility study to collect tissue&#xD;
        perfusion data throughout the duration of a standard of care (SOC) endovascular&#xD;
        intervention, alongside live data capture of the angiography utilized during the case. The&#xD;
        study will enroll up to 20 subjects between the ages of 40 and 90 who are undergoing&#xD;
        endovascular intervention for the management of their PAD. Sites to enroll approximately&#xD;
        half of the subjects with primary &quot;below the knee disease&quot;.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The subject is undergoing endovascular intervention for the management of their PAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The subject is between 40 to 90 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Documented lower limb arterial occlusive or stenotic disease (using ankle-brachial&#xD;
             index / pulse volume recording, duplex ultrasound or CT angiogram) within the last 8&#xD;
             weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. In the opinion of the Investigator, the subject is willing and able to comply with the&#xD;
             protocol and complete all protocol assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The subject has been informed of the nature of the study, agrees to its provisions and&#xD;
             has willingly provided written informed consent, approved by the appropriate&#xD;
             Institutional Review Board (IRB)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects on an investigational drug or being treated with an investigational&#xD;
             therapeutic device, within 30 days of the study visit, that in the view of the&#xD;
             Investigator might interfere with the study outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Presence of a condition that the Investigator considers will compromise the subject's&#xD;
             ability to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects on renal replacement therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Signs of active infection causing localized inflammation on the plantar or dorsal&#xD;
