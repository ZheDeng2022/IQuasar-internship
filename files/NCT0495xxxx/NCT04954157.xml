      The two-part phases will each have a unique patient population, The goal in this application&#xD;
      is to see if that carotid bodies are &quot;offline&quot; is correct and to determine whether a cohort&#xD;
      of SARS-Cov-2 patients can be identified who fit this profile and would be suitable for drug&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The testing will require one group of subjects to hold their breaths for a short period while&#xD;
      the investigators monitor vital signs and blood O2 levels. A second group of &quot;healthier&quot;&#xD;
      COVID subjects will be asked perform a walk-test inside their rooms for six minutes while&#xD;
      vital signs are monitored as well as blood O2 levels. If the subjects are in the healthy&#xD;
      control group, they will perform the walk test in a designated hallway at the medical center&#xD;
      also while there vitals are being monitored. The goal, using a mild stimulus, is to determine&#xD;
      whether respiration increases if blood O2 saturation is decreased. If it does not, that would&#xD;
      indicate a failure of the carotid body oxygen sensing system.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 are hypoxic (O2 blood saturation below 92%). Many do&#xD;
      not even realize they are hypoxic, since breathing can remain comfortable. In these patients,&#xD;
      the normal physiologic responses to low oxygen, increased respiration, appears to be absent&#xD;
      (Couzin-Frankel, 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A wide variety of cell types within the body express the ACE2 receptor that is required by&#xD;
      the virus to infect cells. This included the cells of the carotid body, which are the O2&#xD;
      sensors of the body. The investigators hypothesize that glomus cells of the carotid body are&#xD;
      among the first cells infected due to their extremely high blood perfusion rates. After&#xD;
      infection, they are &quot;offline&quot; and the body no longer recognizes that it is hypoxic. This can&#xD;
      be extremely detrimental to patients that may require mechanical ventilation to re-establish&#xD;
      normal blood O2 levels (&gt;95% saturation). Death rates on patients using mechanical&#xD;
      ventilators are very high and every effort should be made to keep patients off these&#xD;
      machines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interestingly, hypoxia appears to be a common condition in SARS-CoV-2 infected people, with&#xD;
      some showing serious respiratory conditions (acute respiratory distress syndrome - ARDS), but&#xD;
      others not. The majority appear to die from a &quot;cytokine storm&quot;, a massive reaction to the&#xD;
      infection by the immune system (Xie et al., 2020). But many others are hypoxic and sick. Many&#xD;
      medical centers are treating SARS-Cov-2 patients identically, placing them on mechanical&#xD;
      respirators. Below is a short description from a German group from an editorial that was&#xD;
      recently published (Gattinoni et al., 2020) suggesting that not all SARS-CoV-2 hypoxic&#xD;
      patients are the same and so should not be treated identically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been known for a long time that mechanical ventilation in ICU patients, not related to&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2, can be very hard on patients with death rates above 50% (Fialkow et al., 2014)&#xD;
      and with very long recovery times (Griffiths &amp; Jones, 1999). Patients admitted to ICUs who&#xD;
      need mechanical ventilation are expected to have higher mortality rates compared with those&#xD;
      who do not require respiratory support (Vincent et al., 2002) as a consequence of&#xD;
      ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Intubated patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 also have&#xD;
      very high death rates (Richardson et al., 2020). Undoubtedly, they are the sickest of the&#xD;
      sick. Nonetheless, everything possible should be done to prevent intubation a policy&#xD;
      consistent with University of Chicago usage of high flow nasal cannulation. The investigators&#xD;
      goal with this IRB submission is to identify a cohort of SARS-CoV-2 patients that are hypoxic&#xD;
      but their breathing is not responding correctly to the hypoxia (&quot;silent hypoxia&quot;). It is&#xD;
      possible that these patients can be treated with drugs, in order to keep them from intubation&#xD;
      for as long as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I - Study of silent hypoxia in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Phase 1 will recruit 40&#xD;
      subjects with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection and another 40 healthy subjects as the control&#xD;
      group. Totaling 80 subjects in the first phase. This large a group is not required to&#xD;
      determine if &quot;silent hypoxia&quot; exists, rather to determine the percentage of patients&#xD;
      exhibiting altered oxygen sensing, among this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Phase will include observation and collection of clinical data that is routinely&#xD;
      captured in hospitalized COVID patients. All COVID-19 patients at the University of Chicago&#xD;
      Medical Center (UCMC) are connected to telemetry monitors that measure vital signs.&#xD;
      Peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2), respiratory rate (RR), and heart rate (HR) are&#xD;
      continuously measured by the telemetry monitors. Blood pressure is intermittently checked and&#xD;
      measured by the telemetry monitor at an interval determined by physician orders at admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the subject's performing the test, they will have the option of watching a brief&#xD;
      instructional video, created by the PI, on how to correctly perform the phase one test. Both&#xD;
      the COVID and healthy subjects will have this option, if they feel they need further&#xD;
      instruction other than what the clinician administering the test has already provided. Once&#xD;
      the subject feels ready, will then be asked to hold their breaths up to 60 seconds or until&#xD;
      they can no longer hold their breath. Every patient will be asked to hold their breath 3&#xD;
      times with 5 minutes of rest between trials. Subjects will be instructed to hold their breath&#xD;
      and their vital signs will be recorded before, during, and after breath holding by the&#xD;
      patient's attending physician in the COVID unit. The goal is to see whether breath holding&#xD;
      makes the subject uncomfortable, as it would do in a normal subject. If their O2 sensing is&#xD;
      impaired the drive to breath may be absent or diminished. After the breath holding stops, it&#xD;
      is expected that the patient may start to gasp and breathe more rapidly, to make up for the&#xD;
      oxygen deficit. Will all subjects respond to hypoxia correctly? Or will some subjects ignore&#xD;
      the hypoxia, because they do not know they need to stop? In that case, a member of the study&#xD;
      team will stop them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure patient safety the attending physicians will instruct and monitor subjects while&#xD;
      they are participating in this study. Changes in O2 saturation below 85% or an absolute drop&#xD;
      of more than 8% will trigger the physician to instruct the patient to start breathing. Table&#xD;
      1, below, will guide breath-holding criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II - Studies of silent hypoxia in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Phase 2 will recruit 10&#xD;
      subjects and ask them ambulate for six minutes in their hospital room. This length of time is&#xD;
      adapted from the six minute walk test (6MWT), which is a well validated measure of both&#xD;
      aerobic and functional capacity (Troosters et al., 2002; Enright, 2003). The purpose of the&#xD;
      experiment is to test whether simple physical exertion in ambulatory COVID patients is&#xD;
      associated with reductions in SpO2 and/or physiologic changes in vital signs. The 6MWT will&#xD;
      be adapted and ask subjects to ambulate back and forth in their room (rather than along a&#xD;
      100m corridor), since this study is primarily interested in the physiologic responses to&#xD;
      exertion (rather than total distance walked). The study team will also measure at baseline&#xD;
      and after completion of walking a set of vital signs as well as ask subjects about their&#xD;
      perceived exertion using the Borg Rating of Perceived exertion instrument. In this phase,&#xD;
      patients will be instructed and continuously monitored by attending physicians working in the&#xD;
      COVID unit. The attending physicians will monitor these patients by standing outside of the&#xD;
      patient's room but in full view of the patient through the window and/or doorway in the COVID&#xD;
      unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this phase, patients will be recruited with a documented AM-PAC score ≥19. The AM-PAC&#xD;
      score is documented daily by UCMC nurses in the nursing and therapy flow sheets within EPIC.&#xD;
      The score of ≥19 is used by both UCMC nurses and physical therapists to indicate patients'&#xD;
      functional independence. The daily AM-PAC scoring of patients by nurses at UCMC is required&#xD;
      and based on an adapted version of the Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care (AM-PAC)&#xD;
      instrument (Haley et al., 2004). This nursing requirement and the adapted AM-PAC scoring was&#xD;
      a joint UCMC nursing and physical therapy initiative, Project Walk, to better target patients&#xD;
      who may or may not need PT during their admission based on their functional mobility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure patient safety the attending physicians will instruct and monitor patients while&#xD;
      they are participating in this study. Changes in O2 saturation below 85% or an absolute drop&#xD;
      of more than 5% will trigger the physician to instruct the patient to start breathing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What if all SARS-CoV-2 patients have impaired O2 sensing? This may not be out of the&#xD;
      question, since it appears that loss of smell and taste are reliable indicators of infection&#xD;
      (Menni et al.). In that case, the investigators population studies will indicate that&#xD;
      everyone is hypoxic when stressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Identification, Recruitment &amp; Payment All COVID subjects will be recruited and&#xD;
      enrolled from the COVID unit at the University of Chicago Medical Center (UCMC). The healthy&#xD;
      subjects will come from the faculty and staff from UCMC. To avoid any possible bias, healthy&#xD;
      volunteers will not have any relationship to this study prior or be under the supervision of&#xD;
      the investigators at the time they participate in this study. The healthy subjects will not&#xD;
      be hospitalized at the time they are recruited for this study. Subjects will not be&#xD;
      compensated for participating in the study.&#xD;
