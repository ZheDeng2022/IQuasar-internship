      Utilization of T2* MRI in predicting prognosis in patients with cervical spondylotic&#xD;
      myelopathy (CSM)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM), an age-related degenerative disease that is common&#xD;
      worldwide, is mainly caused by compression of the spinal cord and may possibly lead to&#xD;
      disability. Surgery to reduce direct compression of the spinal cord might alleviate disease&#xD;
      progression; due to individual differences, some patients do not benefit from surgery.&#xD;
      Prognostic prediction is important because it affects subsequent treatment decision making.&#xD;
      Currently, prognosis is generally based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with a detailed&#xD;
      macrostructural evaluation of the spinal cord. Unfortunately, the use of conventional MRI&#xD;
      indicators (e.g., increased intensity signal [ISI]) to predict CSM outcomes has been&#xD;
      controversial because of their subjectivity or the insufficient information contained&#xD;
      therein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new biomarker, T2* MRI gray matter to white matter signal intensity ratio (GM/WM), is&#xD;
      associated with demyelination and gliosis. Previous studies have shown that patients with CSM&#xD;
      can have T2* MRI WM / GM changes at the early stage of disease, and the WM / GM value is&#xD;
      increased, which is significantly higher than that of normal people, and is related to the&#xD;
      spinal cord function score. However, the correlation between this index and long-term&#xD;
      prognosis remains to be studied.&#xD;
