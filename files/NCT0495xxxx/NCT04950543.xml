  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many interventions in the field of meditation are becoming increasingly popular and have&#xD;
      gained worldwide acceptance over the past years, both in terms of health, but also&#xD;
      psychological aspects. On the other hand, controversial and sometimes hypercritical positions&#xD;
      are on the rise, questioning the positive effects of meditation on health due to the limited&#xD;
      availability of high-quality scientific data. With regard to a large number of meditation&#xD;
      interventions, the systematic exploration of procedures that have not yet been scientifically&#xD;
      evaluated - also in online settings - is a meaningful contribution to meditation research.&#xD;
