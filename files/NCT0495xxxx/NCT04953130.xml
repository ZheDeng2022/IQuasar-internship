    <textblock>
      Add-Vacc is an unblinded cluster-randomised trial (CRT) with two arms: (i) the national HPV&#xD;
      vaccination programme (girls aged ~14 years, control arm) and (ii) the national programme&#xD;
      plus single-dose male HPV vaccination given to a multi-year cohort of boys (intervention&#xD;
      arm). The CRT will be conducted in 26 communities/clusters (13 per arm) in northern Tanzania.&#xD;
      Boys aged 14 to 18 years in the intervention arm will receive one dose of the 4-valent HPV&#xD;
      vaccine (Gardasil®) that protects against HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18. Population genital HPV&#xD;
      prevalence in 18 to 21-year-olds will be compared between intervention clusters (female and&#xD;
      male vaccination) and control clusters (female vaccination only) at 3 years after the&#xD;
      intervention. Blood sampling for immune responses and adverse event data collection will be&#xD;
      performed in a subset of 200 male subjects in selected intervention clusters.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Parents and adult male participants (aged 18 years) must sign an ICF and male&#xD;

             and are willing to participate in the study and to receive HPV vaccination. If the&#xD;

             informed consent/assent must be witnessed by a literate third party who is not&#xD;
             involved in the conduct of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have been born male, and must be aged 14 to 18 years inclusive at&#xD;
             time of vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be living in an intervention community (cluster).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be willing and able to comply with the protocol requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must agree to avoid all non-trial immunisations in the 14 days following&#xD;
             vaccination with the trial vaccine, other than emergency vaccinations such as&#xD;
             post-exposure rabies or tetanus vaccinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be healthy as determined by a medical history. A physical&#xD;
             examination will be conducted if necessary according to the clinician's judgement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Boys will be excluded from HPV vaccination if:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They have previously been vaccinated against HPV.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They have a history of allergy or anaphylaxis to one or more of the HPV vaccine&#xD;
             components, to yeast or to latex.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They are enrolled in another vaccine research study that specifically specifies that&#xD;
             they must not participate in a study of another vaccine&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They have been diagnosed with a chronic condition (except HIV, as per the comment&#xD;
             above), such as an autoimmune condition, sickle cell disease, degenerative disease,&#xD;
             neurologic or genetic disease, among others;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  There are significant conditions or clinically significant findings for which, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the investigator, participation would not be in the best interest of the&#xD;
             participant (e.g., it would compromise their safety or well-being).&#xD;
