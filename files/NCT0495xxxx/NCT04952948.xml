  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) is a chronic inflammatory disease that is associated with loss&#xD;
      of functional capacity and increased blood pressure. Coupled with this, there is an increased&#xD;
      risk of falls and fractures in patients with T2D. On the other hand, conventional training&#xD;
      programs for resistance, aerobic or combined exercises are strongly recommended for people&#xD;
      with T2D, as they promote a reduction in the glycemic rate and blood pressure, and an&#xD;
      improvement in functional capacity. However, little is known about unconventional training&#xD;
      programs such as PILATES (dynamic and isometric muscle actions) on functional capacity and&#xD;
      cardiovascular adaptations in T2D.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) is a chronic inflammatory disease whose main mechanism of&#xD;
      installation is insulin resistance and is associated with loss of functional capacity with&#xD;
      consequent fragility and increased blood pressure. Currently, women have the highest&#xD;
      prevalence of T2D in Brazil. Previous studies have shown that women are more affected by&#xD;
      cases of hospitalization and that they have a higher risk of mortality due to illness. Muscle&#xD;
      function and strength in patients with T2D show a reduction compared to healthy and&#xD;
      normoglycemic subjects, especially in menopausal women, when estrogen declines with a&#xD;
      consequent increase in body fat and decreased muscle quality. Coupled with this, there is a&#xD;
      reduction in muscle mass and an increased risk of falls and fractures in patients with T2D.&#xD;
      Its association with other factors such as physical inactivity, involuntary weight loss, less&#xD;
      muscle strength and slower gait can lead to frailty and limit the performance of basic daily&#xD;
      activities. On the other hand, conventional training programs for resistance, aerobic or&#xD;
      combined exercises are strongly recommended for people with T2D, as they promote a reduction&#xD;
      in the glycemic rate and blood pressure, and an improvement in functional capacity.&#xD;
      Unconventional training programs such as PILATES (dynamic and isometric muscle actions)&#xD;
      ensure the control of forces that act on the musculoskeletal system, promoting an important&#xD;
      improvement in functional capacity and possible cardiovascular adaptations. Additionally,&#xD;
      elderly people have pronounced losses of neuromuscular adaptations even in a short period of&#xD;
      detraining, compromising gains related to functional capacity and this loss can be even more&#xD;
      pronounced in patients with T2D. Therefore, it is also necessary for training professionals&#xD;
      to understand the effects of the short detraining period after unconventional exercise&#xD;
      programs like PILATES on the functional capacity of elderly women with T2D as well as to&#xD;
      understand the effects of the PILATES training on blood pressure or cardiovascular&#xD;
      adaptations.&#xD;

    <description>During the PILATES sessions, the practitioner received orientations to to perform slow movements, aware, and combined with the respiratory cycle. The exercises program was performed on a soft ground covered with tatamis. During the program, a set of swiss balls of 45, 55, and 65 cm in size and elastic bands of very moderate resistance were used. Each exercise session was divided into 3 stages, namely (a) global initial static and dynamic stretching (10 minutes); (b) general conditioning (45 minutes) and; (c) relaxation (5 minutes). The amount of series and repetitions per set in exercises, in addition to the intensity required in each session in PILATES is presented in Table 2 of Melo et al. (2020) - Vide reference.</description>
