    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine the most effective treatment with Transcutaneous Electrical&#xD;
      Acustimulation (TEA) for Irritable Bowel Syndrome with Constipation (IBS-C) by comparing&#xD;
      efficacy between 5 separate sessions. The rectum pressure as measured by a device called a&#xD;
      barostat will be compared between visits. Each session will be testing a different&#xD;
      combination of frequency and body position of the electrodes. Electrodes placed at either the&#xD;
      wrist or knee will be stimulated at either 25 Hz or 100 Hz.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study aims to discern whether Transcutaneous Electrical Acustimulation (TEA) at&#xD;
      acupuncture points ST36 and/or PC6 will relieve the abdominal pain associated with IBS-C.&#xD;
      Each study participant will have 5 research visits at the Michigan Medicine GI physiology&#xD;
      lab. During these visits, they will undergo a procedure similar to Anal Rectal Manometry&#xD;
      (ARM) performed by the GI physiology lab staff. TEA is similar to this procedure as it is&#xD;
      uses the barostat device and is performed by the GI physiology lab staff. This device has a&#xD;
      rubber catheter that will be inserted 5-15 cm into the rectum of the study participant. Then&#xD;
      the GI physiology staff will inflate the catheter. They will ask the study participant when&#xD;
      they can sense the catheter. Then the GI physiology staff will continue to inflate the&#xD;
      catheter and the study participants feel discomfort (described as the 'urge to defecate').&#xD;
      Then the study participant will be asked to pass the balloon (like they would pass a bowel&#xD;
      movement).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The difference between ARM procedure and the study procedure is that there will be&#xD;
      stimulation of acupuncture point ST36 which is below the knee cap or stimulation of&#xD;
      acupuncture point PC6 which is just above the wrist. For this study, this mild electrical&#xD;
      stimulation will occur simultaneously with the barostat procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each visit there will be stimulation of only one of the points at either 100Hz or 25Hz.&#xD;
      These are the potential combinations: ST36 100Hz, ST36-25Hz, PC6-100Hz, PC6-25Hz, Sham-TEA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The frequency and position combination (or sham visit) is randomly assigned. The&#xD;
      randomization determines the order in which the study participant moves through the study.&#xD;
      Every study participant will, in the end, complete one visit at each frequency and a sham&#xD;
      visit. The study participant will also complete surveys at the appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TEA device is classified by the FDA as a non-significant risk device.&#xD;
