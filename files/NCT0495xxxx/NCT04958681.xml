  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The negative impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the physical activity behavior of overall&#xD;
      adults has been reported. But much less is known in older adults. Alterations in physical&#xD;
      activity among Covid-19 survivors have not been investigated so far. The present study aimed&#xD;
      to evaluate the physical activity status of older adults in terms of a history of Covid-19&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;

    <description>The participants were subsequently asked whether the pandemic had altered their physical activity status and rate the severity of reduction in mobility level compared to the period before the Covid-19 with the following options: none, 0; mild, 1; moderate, 2; severe, 3. Then, the participants were also asked whether they perform a physical exercise in a home setting. We recorded regular outdoor physical activity and home-based exercises (only after the pandemic) as a dichotomous variable (yes or no). The number of physical activity days per week was also obtained.</description>
