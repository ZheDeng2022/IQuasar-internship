    <textblock>
      This study is a two-part Phase 1b/2a First-in-Human (FIH) randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled clinical trial to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics, and&#xD;
      efficacy of multiple ascending doses of CNP-201 in Part A, with the goal of identifying a&#xD;
      safe and tolerable dose level to be evaluated further in a larger number of subjects in Part&#xD;
      B.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects who meet all inclusion and no exclusion criteria after initial screening assessments&#xD;
      will undergo a Skin Prick Test (SPT) followed by a baseline Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled&#xD;
      Food Challenge (DBPCFC) consisting of peanut and placebo (oat) challenges, administered on&#xD;
      two separate days to confirm an allergy to peanut. Subjects who continue to meet all&#xD;
      inclusion and no exclusion criteria after completing both days of the DBPCFC will be enrolled&#xD;
      into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To mitigate the risk of anaphylaxis ahead of administering CNP-201, all Subjects who continue&#xD;
      to meet all inclusion and no exclusion criteria following the DBPCFC will receive&#xD;
      subcutaneous injections of omalizumab (XOLAIR). The dose of omalizumab (XOLAIR) will follow&#xD;
      the product label specified in the protocol and will be determined by the subject's serum IgE&#xD;
      at Screening and weight measured at the XOLAIR Dose 1 visit. Subjects will be dosed either&#xD;
      every 2 weeks or every 4 weeks according to the product label.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who continue to meet all inclusion and no exclusion criteria will be randomized on&#xD;
      Day 1 in a 2:1 ratio (Part A) or 1:1 ratio (Part B) to receive either CNP-201 or Placebo&#xD;
      (0.9% Sodium Chloride USP) by intravenous (IV) infusion. Subjects will be administered&#xD;
      CNP-201 or Placebo on Day 1 and on Day 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will remain in the clinic on Day 1 and Day 8 from the time of admission (prior to&#xD;
      administration of CNP-201 or Placebo) through the final procedure conducted 4 hours post-dose&#xD;
      that same day unless an infusion reaction, anaphylaxis, or other adverse event requires an&#xD;
      extended duration of monitoring. Subjects will be discharged if safety parameters are&#xD;
      acceptable to the investigator. Seven days after the second administration of CNP-201 or&#xD;
      Placebo, subjects must return to the clinic for collection of safety labs, PD measurements,&#xD;
      and assessment of AEs and medication changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will continue to be followed for safety, pharmacodynamics, and immunogenicity during&#xD;
      the Post-Dosing period.&#xD;
