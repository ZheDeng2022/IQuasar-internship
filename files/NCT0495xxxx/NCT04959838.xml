  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ophthalmology physicians and residents work under stress conditions during night emergency&#xD;
      ophthalmology shifts. Under time pressure, that is a characteristic of the urgency of care,&#xD;
      they must use all their cognitive resources to make an accurate diagnosis and to provide&#xD;
      accurate decisions, with sometimes surgical emergency acts. In addition, in France, they work&#xD;
      at night following by an usual day work, and they can also work 48 consecutive hours during&#xD;
      weekends, followed by a work day … i.e. 60 consecutive hours of work … Long working hours&#xD;
      with a short recovery time has been demonstrated to be a major factor of stress and fatigue.&#xD;
      Even if not demonstrated on ophthalmologists, those working conditions may contribute to&#xD;
      symptoms of mental exhaustion and physical fatigue (sleep deprivation), often accompanied by&#xD;
      a loss of motivation at work. This may leads to a feeling of loss of time control; stress can&#xD;
      also distort the perception of time and leads to hasty actions or delayed decision-making.&#xD;
      The combined effects of stress, feelings of loss of time control, and fatigue necessarily&#xD;
      have an impact on work performance and work quality, with a high risk of medical error.&#xD;
      Moreover, prolonged stress may expose ophthalmologists to a higher risk of multiple diseases,&#xD;
      predominantly systemic inflammation and coronary heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main hypothesis is that prolonged work (up to 60 consecutive working hours) may impact on&#xD;
      HRV, comparatively to a typical working day.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The JOBSTRESS.OPH protocol was designed to study the impact of prolonged work (up to 60&#xD;
      consecutive working hours) on HRV, comparatively to a typical working day. Each residents and&#xD;
      / or ophthalmology physicians participates up to a maximum of 5 times. Participants wears a&#xD;
      heart rate belt and a watch that measures physical activity and skin conductance for 34 hours&#xD;
      straight. Participants only wears an EEG monitor while sleeping to assess its quality. At the&#xD;
      end of the evaluation session, a simulator test mimicking the successive stages of cataract&#xD;
      surgery is performed, as well as the performance of saliva tests. Short quality of life&#xD;
      assessment questionnaires are completed at the start and end of the day, supplemented by a&#xD;
      general questionnaire completed only once during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be performed using Stata software (v15, Stata-Corp, College&#xD;
      Station, US). Categorical parameters will be described in terms of numbers and frequencies,&#xD;
      whereas continuous variables will be expressed as mean and standard deviation or median and&#xD;
      [inter-quartile range] according to statistical distribution. All statistical tests will be&#xD;
      two-sided and p&lt;0.05 will be considered significant. Graphic representations will be complete&#xD;
      presentations of results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators process multivariate physiological series (HRV, SC, biomarkers) in order to&#xD;
      build a stress index. For such multivariate physiological series, investigators first use&#xD;
      change point analysis on each univariate series in order to get clusters with constant&#xD;
      parameters, then investigators use classification algorithm on the constant parameters&#xD;
      obtained in first step in order to obtain different classes corresponding to different levels&#xD;
      of stress. Eventually, investigators obtain at each time the level of stress and can compare&#xD;
      it to the environmental conditions.&#xD;
