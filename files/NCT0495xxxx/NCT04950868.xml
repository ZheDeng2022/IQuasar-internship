  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postpartum depression is a serious disorder that affects approximately 14% of women who have&#xD;
      recently given birth. Postpartum depression is either an episode of major depressive disorder&#xD;
      (only low periods) or bipolar disorder (periods of lows and highs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Untreated postpartum depression can negatively affect the mother, the infant and the family.&#xD;
      Antidepressants are the most used treatments; however, for many women these drugs are not&#xD;
      useful, resulting in a pressing need for effective treatments for postpartum depression. Lack&#xD;
      of sleep is common after delivery and can trigger depression in some women. Quetiapine, a&#xD;
      drug used for bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder and occasionally sleeplessness has&#xD;
      not been well studied in postpartum depression. This study aims to find out how mothers&#xD;
      tolerate the drug and whether it is effective for postpartum depression. Results of this&#xD;
      study may help investigators carry out a larger study comparing quetiapine and placebo (a&#xD;
      sugar pill) in postpartum depression.&#xD;

    <measure>Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events as assessed by the Systematic Monitoring of Adverse events Related to TreatmentS (SMARTS) score</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Systematic Monitoring of Adverse events Related to TreatmentS (SMARTS), will be used to gather information about side effects of quetiapine. It is a check list to identify potential side effects.</description>

    <measure>Maternal functioning will be measured by the Barkin Index of Maternal Functioning (BIMF)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Tolerability described as the degree to which overt adverse effects are tolerated, will be measured using the Barkin Index of Maternal Functioning (BIMF). The Barkin Index of Maternal Functioning score from baseline to week 8 will also be assessed. The sum of the scores is calculated, ranging from 0 to 120. Where a score of 120 means perfect functioning. The different between the scores scores will be looked at and a more positive score (8 week score is greater than baseline score) is a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Hamilton Depression Rating (HDRS) total score</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary outcome will be the mean change from baseline to week 8 in the Hamilton Depression Rating (HDRS) total score, the proportion of participants achieving response (≥50% reduction in HDRS score at baseline) and the proportion of participants achieving remission (HDRS ≤12). The score ranges from 0-53 where a higher score is a worse outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Young Mania Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The mean change in scores of Young Mania Rating Scale. The YMRS is a rating scale used to evaluate manic symptoms at baseline and over time in individuals with mania. There are four items that are graded on a 0 to 8 scale (irritability, speech, thought content, and disruptive/aggressive behavior), while the remaining seven items are graded on a 0 to 4 scale. These four items are given twice the weight of the others. The score ranges from 0 to 60 where 60 indicates a worse outcome.</description>
