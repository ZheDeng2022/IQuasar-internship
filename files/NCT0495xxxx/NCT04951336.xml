    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the effect&#xD;
      of two polypore mushrooms, Fomitopsis officinalis and Trametes versicolor (FoTv), for use as&#xD;
      an adjunct to vaccination for COVID-19 in a general population at the time of COVID-19&#xD;
      vaccination.&#xD;

      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the effect&#xD;
      of two polypore mushrooms, Fomitopsis officinalis and Trametes versicolor (FoTv), for use as&#xD;
      an adjunct to vaccination for COVID-19 in a general population at the time of COVID-19&#xD;
      vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fo and Tv have immunomodulatory properties which may increase antibody titers in response to&#xD;
      vaccination more than vaccination alone. However, because they are also immunomodulatory -&#xD;
      not purely immune-stimulating - they may have the added benefit of simultaneously decreasing&#xD;
      vaccine-related side effects following COVID-19 vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to establish the safety and feasibility of the use of FoTv vs placebo;&#xD;
      evaluate the effect on post-vaccination clinical symptoms, neutralizing antibody, and immune&#xD;
      response in 45 total subjects&#xD;

    <description>Drug: FoTv The dosage of FoTv is 8 capsules three times a day for 4 consecutive days. It does not need to be consumed with food. It is best taken at least 30 minutes before OR at least 60 minutes after meals, in the morning, noon and evening. Accidentally missed doses will not need to be taken at a later time but will be recorded in a daily diary. Should swallowing capsules be an issue, they can be opened and dispensed into water or juice for easy ingestion.</description>

Accidentally missed doses will not need to be taken at a later time but will be recorded in a daily diary.
