      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intensive care unit (ICU) is a special department in the health care facility. Although with&#xD;
      high development of modern medicine nowadays, the average mortality rate in ICU is still&#xD;
      around 7 to 20 %. There are a few tricky problems that intensivists and ICU nurses faced very&#xD;
      often, including ICU delirium, arrhythmia and poor digestion problem that will all affect the&#xD;
      mortality and morbidity rate of critical care patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A randomized control trial will examine the effect of press tack acupuncture vs.&#xD;
      press tack placebos. The patients will be randomly divided (1:1) into one of two groups. A&#xD;
      total of 80 ICU patients will have to meet the following criteria: age 20-90, newly ICU&#xD;
      admission(&lt;48 hours), APACHE score &lt;30, one or no inotropic medicine use, FiO2&lt; 60%. Three&#xD;
      interventions will be given in each group. The main outcomes will be the incidence of&#xD;
      arrhythmia, delirium, and poor digestion and the severity of pain. We will also record ICU&#xD;
      mortality, ICU stays and hospital days.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Expected outcome: The study finding will help to determine the therapeutic effect of&#xD;
      acupuncture for ICU complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other information: This study will be conducted in the ICU departments of China medical&#xD;
      hospital and Asia University Hospital, Taichung city, Taiwan. The study is conducted on&#xD;
      stable ICU patients and we don't anticipate any serious risk for adverse events following the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;

    <description>Patients enrolled will receive intervention in a form of either press tack acupuncture needles or press tack placebos. Three total intervention sessions will be taken place on day 1,3,5 from patient's enrolment. Needles/placebos skin withdrawal will be done 48 hours after treatment by an acupuncture doctor or by a trained ICU nurne. In cases when a patient will be transferred from the ICU, the 3 study interventions will be continued in the new ward.</description>
