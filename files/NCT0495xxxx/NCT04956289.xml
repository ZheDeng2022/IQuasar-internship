    <measure>Performance of Upper Limb (PUL)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 48 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The PUL provides both a total score and sub-scores for the 3 domains (shoulder, middle, and distal) that in DMD are progressively involved with a proximal to distal gradient. The PUL includes 22 items with an entry item to define the starting functional level, and 21 items subdivided into shoulder level (4 items), middle level (9 items), and distal level (8 items) dimensions. Scoring options vary across the scale between 0-1 to 0-6 according to performance. Each dimension can be scored separately with a maximum score of 16 for the shoulder level, 34 for the middle level, and 24 for the distal level. A total score can be achieved by adding the 3 level scores (maximum total score 74).</description>

    <measure>Brooke scale</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 48 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The Brooke scale for upper limb has grades ranging from 1 to 6. Grade 1 is given to the patient who can keep both his arms by his sides in the starting position and is then able to abduct the arms fully so that both the arms are touching over the head. Grade 6 is given when the patient is unable to raise his hands to his mouth, and the hands show no functional usefulness.</description>

    <measure>Vignos scale</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 48 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The Vignos scale for lower limb has grades ranging from 1 to 10; 1 means that the patient is able to walk and climb stairs without assistance, while 10 means that the patient is bed bound. Ambulant patients score 1 to 6 and non-ambulant patients score 7 to 10 on the Vignos scale.</description>

    <measure>North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 48 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The NSAA is a functional scale devised for use in ambulant children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). It consists of 17 activities graded 0 (unable to perform), 1 (performs with modifications), 2 (normal movement). It assesses abilities necessary to remain ambulant that have been found to progressively deteriorate in untreated DMD patients, as well as in other muscular dystrophies such as Becker Muscular Dystrophy. NSAA Total Score ranges from 0 to 34, with a score of 34 implying normal function.</description>
