  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To reach herd immunity for COVID-19, experts estimate that 70% of the population will need to&#xD;
      be vaccinated. However, vaccination rates have begun to slow down in the United States. The&#xD;
      investigators will partner with Philadelphia to launch a COVID-19 vaccination sweepstakes, in&#xD;
      which residents will be eligible to win if they have received at least one dose of the&#xD;
      COVID-19 vaccine prior to a given drawing. Drawings will be held every two weeks; multiple&#xD;
      prizes of various sizes will be awarded in each drawing. Half of the prizes in each size&#xD;
      category in each drawing will be awarded to residents of a zip code that is randomly selected&#xD;
      from a pre-defined list of under-vaccinated zip codes (this zip code will be announced at the&#xD;
      start of each 2-week drawing period), the other half will be awarded to residents outside of&#xD;
      that selected zip code. The investigators will analyze vaccination rates in Philadelphia as&#xD;
      compared with neighboring regions before, during, and after the specified time period, as&#xD;
      well as analyze vaccination rates in the three selected zip codes compared to the other zip&#xD;
      codes that could have been targeted (the residual set of under-vaccinated zip codes) to&#xD;
      determine the effectiveness of the sweepstakes at encouraging vaccinations.&#xD;

    <measure>Weekly Vaccination Rate</measure>

    <description>The primary outcome is the weekly vaccination rate for residents receiving a first dose of a COVID-19 vaccination in each zip/county/city as measured by local health departments and, for residency, as measured by the Census or other official sources. The investigators will include data from 5 weeks of pre-intervention, 6 weeks of intervention, and 4 weeks of post-intervention.&#xD;
Weekly Vaccination Rate = Total residents receiving a first dose that week / Total residents in that zip/county/city code as measured by the Census or other official sources, at the most recent date available for all geographies of interest. This source as of pre-registering is the American Community Survey 2019.</description>

These 36 will be chosen over three drawings, with 12 residents chosen in each drawing.</description>
