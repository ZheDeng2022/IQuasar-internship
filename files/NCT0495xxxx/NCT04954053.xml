  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Wheelchair users frequently experience shoulder pain. It has been determined that in our&#xD;
      country, the subjective assessment methods that will help to determine and monitor shoulder&#xD;
      pain severity of wheelchair users are limited. The purpose of this study is to adapt the&#xD;
      original English version of the Wheelchair Users Shoulder Pain Index into Turkish and to&#xD;
      assess its validity and reliability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Firstly, the original English version of WUSPI was translated into Turkish and culturally&#xD;
      adapted, then applied to 100 wheelchair users to investigate the validity of the scale. The&#xD;
      reliability of the scale was assessed by internal consistency and test-retest analysis and&#xD;
      found a high internal consistency. Validation of WUSPI-Tr was assessed by the concurrent&#xD;
      validity method. To establish concurrent validity, WUSPI scores were compared to SPADI and&#xD;
      ASES scores by Spearman correlation analysis. There was a positively excellent correlation&#xD;
      with SPADI and, negatively excellent correlation with ASES. As a result, it is determined&#xD;
      tath the Turkish version of WUSPI-Tr is a valid and reliable tool.&#xD;

      The original version of WUSPI was translated into Turkish via multistep translation rules. It&#xD;
      is culturally adapted into Turkish. The semantic equivalence of the new scale was evaluated&#xD;
      and the Turkish version of the WUSPI (WUSPI-Tr) has been created. It is applied to 100&#xD;
      wheelchair users to investigate the validity of the scale. People who are at least for 1 year&#xD;
      using a manual wheelchair as their primary means of mobility, cognitively unimpaired,&#xD;
      literate, and older than 18 years are included in this study. The reliability of the scale&#xD;
      was assessed by internal consistency and test-retest analysis. As a result of the analysis,&#xD;
      the Cronbach Alfa value was calculated as 0.894, and WUSPI-Tr was found to have high internal&#xD;
      consistency. The WUSPI-Tr questionnaire was re-administered to 50 participants for 7 to 14&#xD;
      days for the test-retest method and the results were compared with the Interclass Correlation&#xD;
      Coefficient (ICC) method. WUSPI has been found to have high reliability (0.997). Validation&#xD;
      of WUSPI-Tr was assessed by the concurrent validity method. To establish concurrent validity,&#xD;
      WUSPI scores were compared to SPADI and ASES scores by Spearman correlation analysis. The&#xD;
      correlation coefficient of WUSPI-Tr with SPADI is 0.931 and with ASES was -0.812. These&#xD;
      results show that there was a positively excellent correlation with SPADI and, negatively&#xD;
      excellent correlation with ASES (p &lt; 0,001). As a result, the Turkish version of WUSPI-Tr is&#xD;
      a valid and reliable tool.&#xD;
