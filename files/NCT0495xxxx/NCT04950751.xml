    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, randomized, controlled, observer-blind study to evaluate the&#xD;
      immunogenicity and safety of different formulations of the investigational adjuvanted&#xD;
      recombinant SARS-CoV-2 trimeric S-protein (from B.1.351 variant) subunit vaccine (SCB-2020S),&#xD;
      when administered as 2-dose vaccination series 21 days apart to adults ≥ 18 years of age.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clover has developed a second candidate vaccine, SCB-2020S, that contains S protein from the&#xD;
      dominant B.1.351 variant. The purpose of clinical study CLO-SCB-2020-001 is to assess the&#xD;
      immunogenicity and safety of different formulations of the SCB-2020S compared to the&#xD;
      prototype SCB-2019 vaccine, and to select a formulation of SCB-2020S for further clinical&#xD;
      development. The protocol plans to enroll 150 participants. There will be 5 study arms and&#xD;
      participants will receive two intramuscular (i.m.) injections, one at Day 1 and one at Day&#xD;
      22.&#xD;
