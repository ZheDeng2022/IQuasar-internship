  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Particulate matter exposure during smoke inhalation provokes inflammatory immune responses in&#xD;
      people exposed to burning biomass including fire fighters and civilians. Persistent&#xD;
      occupational exposure to particulate matter represents a unique hazard for firefighters,&#xD;
      underpinning a burgeoning research area. This trial will evaluate the effects of sleep&#xD;
      deprivation and circadian rhythm disruption on the inflammatory response to woodsmoke&#xD;
      associated particulate matter exposure. Participants will undergo 2 experimental trials in a&#xD;
      randomized cross-over design. Participants will have either an 8-hour sleep opportunity or a&#xD;
      4-hour sleep opportunity prior to reporting to lab for a 45 minute simulated firefighting&#xD;
      trial (wood smoke associated particulate matter filtered to 2.5 um at a concentration of 250&#xD;
      ug/m^3, while exercising at a moderate intensity). The effects of sleep restriction and&#xD;
      simulated firefighting will be measured.&#xD;

      Participants: Healthy college age males (n = 15), free from disordered sleep and without&#xD;
      recent trans-meridian travel (within the last 2 weeks) will be recruited for this study.&#xD;
      Participants will complete chronotype questionnaires (Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire;&#xD;
      MEQ, Munich Chronotype Questionnaire; MCTQ) to establish intermediate chronotypes. This will&#xD;
      minimize the effect of circadian preference on the morning exposure to smoke. Participants&#xD;
      will subsequently be outfitted with activity monitors (ActiCal) to monitor sleep and physical&#xD;
      activity throughout the experimental duration. Participants will be asked to maintain a&#xD;
      normal sleep schedule for at least 3 days leading up to the experimental trials and keep a&#xD;
      sleep log to verify.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Trials: Participants will undergo 2 experimental trials in a randomized&#xD;
      cross-over design, with at least 1 week washout period between trials; 1) NS-250: Normal&#xD;
      Sleep with exposure to woodsmoke at 250 µg/m^3, and RS-250: Restricted Sleep with exposure to&#xD;
      woodsmoke at 250 µg/m^3. Participants will have an 8-hour sleep opportunity in their own home&#xD;
      during the NS trials (22:00-06:00), and a 4-hour sleep opportunity during the RS trials&#xD;
      (00:00-04:00). In all trials, participants will report to the laboratory at 07:30 the morning&#xD;
      after the experimental sleep night. PM exposure will occur from 08:00-08:45 while cycling at&#xD;
      70% heart rate reserve (HRR) to simulate the physical demands of firefighting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exhaled Breath Condensate (EBC): EBC will be collected using standardized 10 minute&#xD;
      collection techniques. In order to preserve sample integrity for potentially labile&#xD;
      biomarkers (e.g., oxidative stress), sample pH will be measured immediately prior to&#xD;
      aliquoting in multiple cryotubes (500-700µl), flash freezing, and storage at -80 degrees C&#xD;
      until further assay. Standardized biomarker panels for oxidative stress and inflammation will&#xD;
      be performed using a single thaw approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inflammatory biomarker analysis: Blood will be collected into heparinized vacutainers before&#xD;
      (PRE) and immediately following (POST) PM2.5 exposure and spun down for plasma collection.&#xD;
      Plasma will be assayed for inflammatory biomarkers (interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor&#xD;
      (TNF)-α, pentraxin-3, and C-reactive protein (CRP)) using standard enzyme linked&#xD;
      immunosorbent assays (ELISA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Circadian Rhythm Assessment: Throughout the experimental protocol, circadian rhythms will be&#xD;
      assessed in two ways; 1) Actigraphy and 2) Clock gene expression in buccal cell swabs.&#xD;
      Acticals will be worn throughout to gather sleep variables (timing, duration, quality). Clock&#xD;
      gene expression (CLOCK, BMAL1, PER2) will be measured in swabs taken from the cheek at 6 hour&#xD;
      intervals (00:00, 06:00, 12:00, 18:00) to assess the effects of sleep deprivation on the&#xD;
      molecular circadian rhythm. Cheek swabs will be immediately placed in RNA stabilization&#xD;
      buffer until isolation. Swabs taken at 00:00 will be performed with minimal exposure to light&#xD;
      to avoid disruption of sleep. These methods have been used previously to assess normal and&#xD;
      disrupted sleep.&#xD;
