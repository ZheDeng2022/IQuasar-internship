  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Levodopa (LD) is an effective treatment to control symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD).&#xD;
      However, the response to (the effectiveness) LD changes over time and patients require higher&#xD;
      and more frequent LD doses for treatment. The purpose of this study is to identify what&#xD;
      reasons or causes might influence the changes in LD effectiveness, particularly if intestinal&#xD;
      bacteria contribute to the breakdown of LD in patients with PD. This study is an&#xD;
      observational cohort proof-of-concept study that follows PD patients who take PD at&#xD;
      high-frequency doses and low-frequency doses. . Each PD patient will have a household healthy&#xD;
      control/spouse enrolled into the study. Single patients with no spouse will still be eligible&#xD;
      to enroll.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Levodopa (LD) is an effective treatment to control symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) and&#xD;
      during the first few years of LD treatment patients are said to experience a 'honeymoon'&#xD;
      period, reflective of a sustained beneficial response to this dopamine pro-drug. However, the&#xD;
      response to LD changes over time and patients require higher and more frequent LD doses. Most&#xD;
      patients develop motor response complications such as frequent periods of immobility and&#xD;
      involuntary movements. The major unmet need is to preserve the initial, stable, response to&#xD;
      LD and prevent the development of motor response complications. It is therefore essential to&#xD;
      identify the underlying mechanism for the changes in LD effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants have two clinic visits spaced 60 days apart. They will be asked to complete&#xD;
      questionnaires at the first visit and will receive the stool collection kit. At the second&#xD;
      visit, they will have fasted prior and their stool kit will be collected. Next, blood, saliva&#xD;
      and breath samples will be collected. A finger tapping test will be conducted for Parkinson's&#xD;
      patients, then participants will be asked to complete diet questionnaires.&#xD;

        We plan to enroll two groups of established PD patients on a stable dose of LD for the&#xD;
        prior 4 weeks. We will enroll twelve patients in each of the following two groups: Group&#xD;
        1:&quot;low frequency dose&quot; patients and Group 2:&quot; high frequency dose &quot;patients. Low frequency&#xD;
        is defined as ≤ 3 LD doses a day and high frequency as ≥ 5 LD doses per day. Each PD&#xD;
        patient will have a household healthy control/spouse enrolled into the study. Single&#xD;
        patients with no spouse will still be eligible to enroll.&#xD;
