  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      China patients in end stage renal disease receiving maintenance dialysis have a high risk of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease (CVD), with a prevalence of 45.5% approximately, and coronary artery&#xD;
      disease (CAD) has been identified as the most common one. It remains unclear that what their&#xD;
      treatment status is and whether this group of patients can benefit from revascularization in&#xD;
      China. The investigators plan to recruit around 30 hospitals from 7 regions as study centers,&#xD;
      which represent different levels of economic development in Mainland China. The detailed&#xD;
      information includes demographics, medical history, coronary angiogram, in-hospital treatment&#xD;
      and procedures, short-term and long-term outcomes. The aim of the study is to provide the&#xD;
      real world knowledge about current status of coronary revascularization and prognosis in&#xD;
      patients with CAD and dialysis.&#xD;

    <description>All-cause deaths includes cardiac death, vascular death and non-cardiovascular death.&#xD;
Cardiac death: any death due to proximate cardiac cause (eg, MI, low-output failure, fatal arrhythmia), unwitnessed death and death of unknown cause, and all procedure-related deaths, including those related to concomitant treatment, will be classified as cardiac death.&#xD;
Vascular death: caused by noncoronary vascular causes, such as cerebrovascular disease, pulmonary embolism, ruptured aortic aneurysm, dissecting aneurysm, or other vascular diseases.&#xD;
Non-cardiovascular death: any death not covered by the above definitions, such as death caused by infection, malignancy, sepsis, pulmonary causes, accident, suicide, or trauma.</description>

    <description>Non-fatal myocardial infarction is defined as elevated cardiac enzymes (troponin or myocardial band fraction of creatine kinase) above the upper reference limit with ischemic symptoms or electrocardiography findings indicative of ischemia that is not related to the index procedure.</description>

    <time_frame>12-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Definitions of all-cause death and non-fatal myocardial infarction as mentioned above.&#xD;
Non-fatal stroke is defined as the rapid onset of a new persistent neurologic deficit attributed to an obstruction in cerebral blood flow and/or cerebral hemorrhage with no apparent non-vascular cause.&#xD;
Repeat revascularization is any unplanned repeat revascularization of either a target vessel or non-target vessel or CABG.&#xD;
Cardiovascular rehospitalization is rehospitalization due to MI, angina, heart failure, stroke, arrhythmia or conduction disturbance, sudden cardiac arrest and other cardiovascular problem.</description>
