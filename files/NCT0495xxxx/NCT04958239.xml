  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is open to adults with advanced cancer (solid tumors). People for whom previous&#xD;
      treatment was not successful can take part in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to find the highest dose of a medicine called BI 765179 that&#xD;
      people with solid tumors can tolerate when taken alone or together with a medicine called&#xD;
      ezabenlimab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant is put into one of two groups. Participants get BI 765179 alone or in&#xD;
      combination with ezabenlimab as infusion into a vein every 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BI 765179 and ezabenlimab are antibodies that may help the immune system fight cancer. In&#xD;
      this study, BI 765179 is given to people for the first time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants can stay in the study up to 3 years if they benefit from treatment and can&#xD;
      tolerate it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The doctors regularly check the participants' health and note any health problems that could&#xD;
      have been caused by the study treatment.&#xD;
