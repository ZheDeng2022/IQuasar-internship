      This study will be directed to determine the effectiveness of laser acupuncture(LA) and&#xD;
      pelvic floor training (PFT) on stress urinary incontinence (SUI) in obese postmenopausal&#xD;
      women. Forty obese postmenopausal women will be selected , suffering from mild to moderate&#xD;
      stress urinary incontinence from mild to moderate stress urinary incontinence, their age&#xD;
      ranges from 50-65 years old and the body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 ≤ 40 Kg/m2. then separate&#xD;
      randomly into two equivalent gatherings. The study group (A) will receive laser acupuncture&#xD;
      therapy and pelvic floor training for 30 min every other day for 12 sessions (3 times per&#xD;
      week). While the control group (B) maintaining their ordinary medical treatment. All&#xD;
      participants will be assessed the pelvic floor muscles strength by using Modified oxford&#xD;
      grading scale and perineometer before starting intervention and at the end of the 12th&#xD;
      session.&#xD;

      Menopause is the most significant period in a woman's life and brings in many physiological&#xD;
      changes that affect life permanently. There have been a lot of opinions about the symptoms&#xD;
      that appear before, during and after the onset of menopause . Menopause is associated with&#xD;
      weight gain, as well as an increase in hypertension and diabetes. Estrogen deficiency can&#xD;
      cause hormonal changes that contribute to the development of osteoporosis. Menopause is&#xD;
      marked by hot flushes, sweating (especially at night), irritability, concentration issues,&#xD;
      joint pain, vaginal dryness, and urogenital disorders( high rate of incontinence) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postmenopausal women are at danger for urogynecology dysfunction, incontinence, prolapse, and&#xD;
      sexual dysfunction as circulating estrogen levels decrease with age. Their signs and symptoms&#xD;
      may have a big impact on one's personal satisfaction. Menopause occurs at a normal age of 51&#xD;
      years in women, with the majority of women experiencing it between the ages of 45 and 55. As&#xD;
      a result, women should expect to live for another 30 years after menopause .&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUI affects 20-30% of young women, 30-40% of moderately aged women, and up to half of the&#xD;
      women in their later years, making it a major social issue that influences the greater part&#xD;
      of postmenopausal women. This issue significantly influences the personal satisfaction of&#xD;
      influenced women , also urinary incontinence may affect the functional ability of elderly&#xD;
      females. Stress urinary incontinence is the most widespread type of incontinence (SUI).&#xD;
      According to a study, SUI is often associated with conditions that cause high intra-abdominal&#xD;
      pressure, for example, pregnancy with or without vaginal conveyance, obesity, and difficult&#xD;
      physical work. The urogenital tract and pelvic floor contain estrogen and progesterone&#xD;
      receptors. This may mean that these hormones play a role in continence. Estrogen does, in&#xD;
      fact, increase urethral closure pressure, possibly due to increased blood flow. Estrogen has&#xD;
      also been shown to improve the epithelia in the vagina, urethra, and bladder wall in&#xD;
      postmenopausal women. As a result, it is reasonable to assume that using postmenopausal&#xD;
      hormone therapy (HT) would reduce the risk of SUI .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most well-known and potentially modifiable danger factor for the advancement of UI is&#xD;
      obesity. In some studies, a positive connection between UI and body mass index (BMI) has&#xD;
      effectively been created. Weight has a direct dose effect on incontinence, with every 5-unit&#xD;
      expansion in BMI raising the risk of incontinence by 20 to 70%. And compared to&#xD;
      ordinary-weight patients, obese patients have about double the risk of presenting with UI.&#xD;
      Increased intra-abdominal pressure, as well as constant tension on tendons and nerves, can&#xD;
      bother or cause pelvic floor problems by causing excessive stretching [6]. Increased&#xD;
      intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) caused by obesity stresses the pelvic floor and leads to the&#xD;
      growth of SUI, according to the prevailing unifying theory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in one's lifestyle can help with simple stress incontinence. Weight loss, liquid&#xD;
      restriction, expected voiding, Kegel muscle preparation, and biofeedback are among the&#xD;
      modifications. In addition, there is a group of incontinence schemes that can be used .The&#xD;
      aim of timed voiding is to keep the bladder from being too full. Exercises to strengthen the&#xD;
      pelvic floor muscles can aid elderly women with urinary incontinence .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there are many ways to treat urinary incontinence such as drug treatment and&#xD;
      surgical intervention, but physical therapy is one of the most successful and best treatment&#xD;
      methods used with patients with urinary incontinence, this method it is the best treatment&#xD;
      methods that help patients strengthen the pelvic muscles and get rid of urinary incontinence&#xD;
      .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incontinence is often treated with pelvic floor exercise (Kegel's Exercise). It consists of&#xD;
      repeated contractions of the pelvic floor muscles, especially the pubococcygeus muscle, to&#xD;
      strengthen the muscles and improve micturition control . Pelvic floor exercise, including how&#xD;
      to do a Kegel press, can be shown to the patient. When contracting the muscles used to avoid&#xD;
      the outflow of urine or flatus, keep the stomach and thighs relaxed . In addition to laser&#xD;
      treatment has a major role in the treatment of many cases .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low-intensity laser therapy (LILT) is a type of phototherapy utilized as a therapy for many&#xD;
      conditions, including musculoskeletal and delicate tissue wounds and persistent ulceration.&#xD;
      Such lasers additionally prescribed as a successful choice to metal needles for the&#xD;
      incitement of acupuncture or musculoskeletal trigger focus. This type of treatment is&#xD;
      ordinarily named &quot;Laser Acupuncture&quot; to recognize it from the more extensive restorative&#xD;
      utilization of such laser gadgets .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laser acupuncture is essentially safer than needle acupuncture because of the non- intrusive&#xD;
      nature of treatment (for example in instances of disease) and a more suitable technique for&#xD;
      the incitement of difficult points as auricular acupuncture points or points around the&#xD;
      perineum or privates (e.g., for sexual dysfunction) . The lumbosacral area of the body may be&#xD;
      treated with laser acupuncture to mimic pelvic floor muscles. Laser acupuncture can stimulate&#xD;
      the posterior S1 via BL31, S2 via BL32, S3 via BL33, S4 via BL34, and the pudendal nerve via&#xD;
      BL35 at the lumbosacral area, as these techniques are effective in treating SUI. As a result,&#xD;
      laser acupuncture can aid in the reinnervation and strengthening of pelvic floor muscles,&#xD;
      thereby alleviating SUI symptoms .&#xD;
