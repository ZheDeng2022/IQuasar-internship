    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-lable, multicenter, phase III study to assess the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of Almonertinib versus platinum-based chemotherapy as first-line therapy in patients&#xD;
      with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring at least one&#xD;
      uncommon EGFR mutation, including L861Q, G719X or S768I. Patients who have not received any&#xD;
      systemic treatment to receive Almonertinib or platinum-based chemotherapy in a 1:1 ratio, and&#xD;
      treatment will be continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or other&#xD;
      discontinuation criteria are met. After progression, patients may receive Almonertinib for as&#xD;
      long as their treating physician considers they are deriving clinical benefit.&#xD;
