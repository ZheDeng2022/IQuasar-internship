      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Morbidity and mortality are the most current important problems encountering medical&#xD;
      scientists in the world in chronic kidney disease patients. (Kazi et al, 2008) Oxidative&#xD;
      stress is associated with oxidative damage to proteins, lipids, and DNA and is playing an&#xD;
      important role in disease progression in chronic kidney disease patients, in oxidative&#xD;
      stress, reactive oxygen species(ROS) production exceeds the antioxidant capacity, also in&#xD;
      hemodialysis, oxidative stress increased due to low-compatibility dialysis membrane&#xD;
      treatments, which activates neutrophils and monocytes (phagocytic cells), and also due to a&#xD;
      decrease in antioxidant capacity in which the activity superoxide dismutase, glutathione&#xD;
      peroxidase, and peroxiredoxin2 enzymes is reduced in addition to low levels of non enzymatic&#xD;
      antioxidants like vitamins C, E, and, A.(Gwozdzinski K et al, 2021) Several comorbidities in&#xD;
      ESRD patients are related to oxidative stress characterized by high levels of pro-oxidants,&#xD;
      like dyslipidemia, vascular calcification, hypertension, diabetes mellitus(DM), and old&#xD;
      age.(Mondaresi et al, 2015) Malnutrition status, and chronic inflammation accompanies&#xD;
      dialysis also triggers reactive oxygen species production.(handelman et al, 2001) 14 times&#xD;
      increase in ROS levels is induced after each hemodialysis session.(Nguyen et al, 1985; Chen&#xD;
      et al, 1998; Yang et al, 2006)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The kidney synthesizes the antioxidant enzymes , including glutathione peroxidases and its&#xD;
      failure leads to reduced levels of these enzymes and as a consequence pro-oxidants are&#xD;
      increased .(Kelly, Rothwell, 2020) The oxidation of fatty acids by free radicals is called&#xD;
      lipid peroxidation and it is responsible for tissue damage.(Fatani et al, 2016)&#xD;
      Malondialdehyde generated from lipid peroxidation is a nucleophilic agent has the ability to&#xD;
      attack and change functions of amino acids and sulfhydryl moiety of proteins.(Slatter et al,&#xD;
      2000) Several studies have approved that enhanced rate of mortality in hemodialysis patients&#xD;
      was associated with oxidative stress in relation with increased levels of MDA ,end product of&#xD;
      unsaturated fatty acid oxidation.(Juretic et al, 2001) Antioxidants are endogenous&#xD;
      antioxidants produced by the body (enzymatic and non enzymatic) and exogenous antioxidants&#xD;
      present in food and supplements.(Liakopoulos et al, 2019) Vitamins B, C, D, and&#xD;
      E,coenzymeQ10, L-carnitine, a-lipoic acid , curcumin, green tea, flavonoids, polyphenols,&#xD;
      omega-3polyunsaturated fatty acid, statins, trace elements, and N-acetyl cysteine have been&#xD;
      studied as exogenous antioxidants for reducing oxidative stress in hemodialysis&#xD;
      patients.(Liakopoulos et al, 2019) Reducing oxidative stress in hemodialysis patients by&#xD;
      using antioxidant treatments may be of useful approach in order to save life , to avoid death&#xD;
      struggle, and to improve their quality of life19.(Navarro et al,2019) Many clinical studies&#xD;
      present in databases have confirmed improved complications accompanied dialysis in patients&#xD;
      supplemented with herbal antioxidants .(Asgharpour M, Alirezaei A , 2012) Lately, attention&#xD;
      is increasing toward the antioxidant effect of rutin.( Moretti E et al, 2012)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flavonoids has recently recognized by scientific group as a unique class of therapeutic&#xD;
      molecules due to their various pharmacological properties, rutin, known as vitamin p or&#xD;
      rotoside has been discovered for many of pharmacological effects.( Ganeshpurkar A, Saluja AK,&#xD;
      2017) Rutin is a flavonol , found in passion flower, buckwheat, tea, and apple.( Ganeshpurkar&#xD;
      A, Saluja AK, 2017) Rutin called rotoside, quercetin-3-rutinoside, and sophorin is acitrus&#xD;
      flavonoid glycoside.( Kreft S, Knapp M, Kreft I, 1999) Rutin is a phytochemical has many&#xD;
      therapeutic properties . ( Ganeshpurkar A, Saluja AK, 2017) An ancient saying an apple a day,&#xD;
      keeps doctor away appear to be right, as rutin, found in apples has many biological&#xD;
      activities. ( Ganeshpurkar A, Saluja AK, 2017) Rutin is needed to be studied extensively to&#xD;
      demonstrate effective safety profile in human to get its benefits as therapeutic supplement.&#xD;
      ( Ganeshpurkar A, Saluja AK, 2017) Rutin as treatment was found to produce considerable&#xD;
      impact on secretion of cytokines. ( Gandhi GR et al, 2020) Cytokines are secreted by immune&#xD;
      cells, and inflammation during long term diseases, causes cytokines- mediated organ&#xD;
      dysfunction and tissue damage, such as in diabetes mellitus, cancer, Rheumatoid arthritis.&#xD;
      (Gautam R et al, 2006) The immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects of rutin on chronic&#xD;
      metabolic diseases support the idea that the rutin can be used in treating such these&#xD;
      disorders and their complications. (Gandhi GR et al, 2020) Blood glucose reduced and lipid&#xD;
      profile improved by using rutin, also activities of ALT, AST, and LDL in the liver, serum,&#xD;
      and heart changes are prevented by rutin, rutin was found to has the ability to reduce&#xD;
      hepatic and cardiac levels of TG and Enhances the glycogen level. (Gandhi GR et al, 2020)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amazingly, the stability of rutin aganist oxidation was found to be greater than its&#xD;
      aglycogen, quercetin. (Suzuki et al,2005) Rutin frequently used combined with vitamin C&#xD;
      because it is essential for vitamin C absorption and as anti -oxidizer. (Bus ze Wski et&#xD;
      al,1993) Human body cannot synthesize flavonoids and the diet can supply rutin, and rutin is&#xD;
      not only for shelf-life prolongation of products, but also increases the nutritional value of&#xD;
      products. (Chua LS, 2013) In addition to toxins hemodialysis removes nutrients from the&#xD;
      blood, such as ascorbic acid (AA) and also hemodialysis patients are deficient from ascorbic&#xD;
      acid due to dietary restrictions and this triggers oxidative stress and inflammation already&#xD;
      induced by uremia ending with cardiovascular events and mortality.(Chaghouri P et al, 2021)&#xD;
      ROS reduced by AA, particularly superoxide anion radical, and in turn ascorbic acid oxidized.&#xD;
      (Bendich A et al, 1986) AA acid competitively reacts with ROS, scavenging them before they&#xD;
      oxidize the cell components, and AA is oxidized, protecting lipid membranes, proteins, and&#xD;
      DNA from damage. (Berratta M et al, 2020) In leukocytes ascorbic acid concentrations reaches&#xD;
      50-to100- higher than in plasma. (Berratta M et al, 2020) There are no studies conducted&#xD;
      about the effect of rutin as antioxidant on the oxidative stress in hemodialysis patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory efficiency of AA, it is essential to see&#xD;
      vitamin c effect on hemodialysis patients. (Chaghouri P et al, 2021) Relying on the&#xD;
      antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effect of both, rutin and vitamin c confirmed by a variety&#xD;
      of studies in vitro and in vivo rutin and vitamin C are selected to be studied in&#xD;
      hemodialysis patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of rutin and vitamin C on&#xD;
      selected oxidative stress and inflammatory markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Prospective, interventional, Open label, randomized controlled clinical trial will be&#xD;
           conducted on adult patients with ESRD on regular hemodialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Settings:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be carried out at nephrology and dialysis unit in ain shams university&#xD;
      hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 105 patients will be recruited and divided into 3 groups: - Group 1: (Ruta C&#xD;
      group) 35 patients will take a dose of 2 tablets of rutin 60 mg in combination with vitamin C&#xD;
      160 mg three times daily for 4 months in addition to their standard therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: (Vitamin C group) 35 patients will take a dose of 500mg of vitamin C two times daily&#xD;
      for 4 months in addition to their standard therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3: Control group, 35patients will take only the standard therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline characteristics: The following data will be collected from all patients at baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Age, sex , weight, duration of ESRD and hemodialysis comorbidities .&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Dialysis duration, BUN, Cr (mg/d L), Albumin (mg/d L), Hb (g m%), renal function test,&#xD;
           liver function test, blood glucose level, TG, total cholesterol level, LDL-C, HLD-C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients will be monitored for side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. blood sample will be withdrawn at baseline and at the end of the study from all groups&#xD;
           then the sera will be centrifuged at 3000 rpm, for 10 minutes at 4°c, and then kept&#xD;
           frozen at -80 C for the biochemical evaluation plasma malondialdehyde, C-Reactive&#xD;
           Protein, GSH-PX, TNF-α and ESR. This analysis will be performed by enzyme linked&#xD;
           immunosorbent assay technique (ELISA)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics Consideration:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will be performed according to Declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Approval of the Research Ethics committee of faculty of pharmacy - Ain-Shams university-&#xD;
           faculty of pharmacy research ethics committee institutional review board.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An Informed consent will be taken from all patients before enrollment in the study&#xD;
           without any obligatory on the patients to withdraw from the study if they want to.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses will be done using the SPSS software (Statistical Package for the Social&#xD;
      Sciences). Continuous variables will be represented as mean + standard deviation (SD) or as&#xD;
      median + interquartile range (IQR). Statistical tests will be chosen based on either the&#xD;
      resulting data will be parametric or non-parametric. P-values lower than 0.05 are considered&#xD;
      statistically significant and P-values lower than 0.001 are considered highly significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was calculated by GPower v.3.1.9.4 1. According to Connelly (2008), the&#xD;
      literature suggests that a pilot study sample should be 10% of the sample 3 equally sized&#xD;
      groups and an alpha of 0.05, the sample size would be 966 participants. For our pilot study,&#xD;
      the required sample size would be 97 participants. To account for dropouts and projected for&#xD;
      the larger parent study 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, for a full-scale study, expecting a small effect size of 0.10, to reach a power of&#xD;
      80% to reject the null hypothesis, with equality of group sizes, we decided to recruit a&#xD;
      total of 105 participants, equally divided among the 3 groups (35 participants in each&#xD;
      group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      F tests - ANOVA: Fixed effects, omnibus, one-way Analysis: A priori: Compute required sample&#xD;
      size Input: Effect size f = 0.10 α err prob = 0.05 Power (1-β err prob) = 0.80 Number of&#xD;
      groups = 3 Output: Noncentrality parameter λ = 9.6900000 Critical F = 3.0050418 Numerator df&#xD;
      = 2 Denominator df = 966 Total sample size = 969 Actual power = 0.8011010&#xD;
