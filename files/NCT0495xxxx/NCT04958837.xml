  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of soccer-related injuries is reported to have the highest rate amongst all&#xD;
      sports. To reduce the incidence of soccer injuries in youth and amateur soccer players, an&#xD;
      injury prevention framework namely FIFA 11+ was established. Although the FIFA 11+ is a&#xD;
      comprehensive warm-up and training program for soccer players, yet in the second component&#xD;
      focusing on strength and plyometric training, the exercises consist of only static core&#xD;
      training whereas dynamic core training is not included in the protocol. Hence this study will&#xD;
      observe the effect of including dynamic core training targeting the remaining core&#xD;
      musculature as well in the FIFA 11 + program for risk factor modification and correction of&#xD;
      muscular imbalance.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Soccer (football) is one of the most popular sports in the world. Intense soccer actions&#xD;
      (i.e., acceleration, decelerations, change of direction, sprinting, tackling, running, being&#xD;
      tackled, and shooting, twisting, turning, jumping and landing during the game) in addition to&#xD;
      high impact and forceful body contacts during practice sessions and matches predispose the&#xD;
      athletes to injuries. various contributing factors of these injuries include muscular&#xD;
      imbalance, joint instability, lack of proper training and inadequate rehabilitation. Poor&#xD;
      landing mechanics, specifically, increased dynamic knee valgus, is also associated with&#xD;
      increased risk for lower limb injury, particularly ACL injury. The modifiable factors are&#xD;
      shown to be responsive to different types of trainings. In fact neuromuscular factors are&#xD;
      involved in control of dynamic knee stability, hamstrings and quadriceps imbalances,&#xD;
      asymmetry of legs and core dysfunction. The latest FIFA 11+ developed in 2006 was designed to&#xD;
      be used as pre-training protocol to improve the components of physical fitness that might&#xD;
      contribute to injury prevention. In this program, there is a combination of three major&#xD;
      exercise regime components: an initial running and stretching exercises, second component of&#xD;
      strength, plyometric and balance exercises, ending with high speed planting and cutting&#xD;
      exercises. One of the component of this program involves the training of core musculature.&#xD;
      While the core muscles (including muscles of trunk and pelvis) do not cross the knee joint,&#xD;
      yet core stability can modulate the lower limb alignment and loading during dynamic tasks.&#xD;
      Hence, this study will be conducted to find whether there is any effect of including dynamic&#xD;
      core training in the FIFA 11+ program in order to correct muscular imbalances and ultimately&#xD;
      risk factor modification. A two-arm single blinded randomized controlled trial will be&#xD;
      conducted to find out the dynamic knee valgus alignment, postural stability and single leg&#xD;
      athletic stability and lower limb muscles strength, while the secondary outcomes would&#xD;
      include lung function tests (FEV1, FVC &amp; FEV1/FVC ratio). In the control group, standard FIFA&#xD;
      11+Protocol will be followed consisting of slow paced running exercises followed by strength,&#xD;
      plyometric and balance training. In the experimental group, FIFA 11+ protocol along with&#xD;
      additional dynamic core exercises will be followed including leg raises, crunches, superman,&#xD;
      plank hip twist, and supine bridge.All exercises in both groups will be progressively&#xD;
      increased as per established protocol. Training will be provided 3-4 Times a week for 8 Weeks&#xD;
      on alternate days.&#xD;
