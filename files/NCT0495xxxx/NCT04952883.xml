  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HRCT was used to evaluate pulmonary vascular remodeling in COPD. The role of H2S in pulmonary&#xD;
      vascular remodeling in COPD was analyzed, in order to provide a basis for seeking new&#xD;
      therapeutic targets.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study aimed to investigate the relationship between endogenous H2S and pulmonary&#xD;
      vascular remodeling on HRCT in patients with COPD through the determination of H2S and its&#xD;
      synthase mRNA levels in blood and pulmonary vessels by HRCT, to evaluate the role of H2S in&#xD;
      pulmonary vascular remodeling in COPD and to provide a basis for seeking new therapeutic&#xD;
      targets. This study had predictive value for clinical prognosis of patients. It had important&#xD;
      clinical guiding significance and social and economic benefit to comprehensively understand&#xD;
      the pathogenesis of COPD.&#xD;
