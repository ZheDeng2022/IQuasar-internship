  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, many studies have pointed out that bacterial toxin storm and cytokine storm&#xD;
      are the main causes of patients with septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction. Endotoxins&#xD;
      are the main mediators of gram-negative bacteria causing systemic inflammation and sepsis.&#xD;
      Endotoxins can interact with Toll- Like receptor 4 (TLR4) binding and trigger cytokine&#xD;
      storms. The triple-effect blood purification filter has been proven to remove endotoxins,&#xD;
      cytokines and urinary toxins, and it has the opportunity to improve shock in patients with&#xD;
      sepsis. We hypothesize that blood purification using the three-effect filter can shorten the&#xD;
      duration and severity of shock in patients with severe septic shock and reduce the organ&#xD;
      damage by removing endotoxin, cytokine and urinary toxins. The primary aim of this study is&#xD;
      to investigate the effect of blood purification using the three-effect filter on shortening&#xD;
      the duration of septic shock. Other exploratory variables include the reduction of severity&#xD;
      of organ damage and other clinical outcomes and prognosis.&#xD;

      In recent years, many studies have pointed out that bacterial toxin storm and cytokine storm&#xD;
      are the main causes of patients with septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction. Endotoxins&#xD;
      are the main mediators of gram-negative bacteria causing systemic inflammation and sepsis.&#xD;
      Endotoxins can interact with Toll- Like receptor 4 (TLR4) binding and trigger cytokine&#xD;
      storms. The triple-effect blood purification filter (oXiris) has been proven to remove&#xD;
      endotoxins, cytokines and urinary toxins, and it has the opportunity to improve shock in&#xD;
      patients with sepsis. We hypothesize that blood purification using the three-effect filter&#xD;
      can shorten the duration and severity of shock in patients with severe septic shock and&#xD;
      reduce the organ damage by removing endotoxin, cytokine and urinary toxins. The primary aim&#xD;
      of this study is to investigate the effect of blood purification using the three-effect&#xD;
      filter on shortening the duration of septic shock. Other exploratory variables include the&#xD;
      reduction of severity of organ damage and other clinical outcomes and prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center, prospective, randomized controlled trial will enroll patient with septic&#xD;
      shock. After the screening of eligibility and obtaining the signed informed consent, the&#xD;
      enrolling patients will be randomly assigned to the following two groups: the control group&#xD;
      and the blood purification group. In the control group, patients will receive the treatments&#xD;
      for septic shock according to the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines. If the primary care&#xD;
      intensivist decides that continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is indicated, the&#xD;
      patient will receive CRRT with regular continuous veno-venous hemofiltration filter. In the&#xD;
      blood purification group, patients will receive the treatments for septic shock according to&#xD;
      the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines. In addition, these patients will receive blood&#xD;
      purification treatment with oXiris filter within two hours after enrollment. The blood&#xD;
      purification treatment will be continued for up to 72 hours as needed, and a new oXiris&#xD;
      filter will be replaced every 12 to 24 hours. If the primary care intensivist decides that&#xD;
      continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is indicated at 72h after blood purification, the&#xD;
      patient will receive CRRT with regular continuous veno-venous hemofiltration filter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following information will be recorded: diagnosis of intensive care unit admission, past&#xD;
      medical history, severity of illness, vital signs, blood pressure, infusion doses of&#xD;
      vasopressors and inotropes, fluid balance, sequential organ failure assessment score, daily&#xD;
      urine output, lactate, creatinine, and other regular laboratory data. Blood sample will be&#xD;
      obtained for analysis of the levels of procalcitonin, cytokines (IL-6, IL-10, HMGB-1 and&#xD;
      TNF-α), vascular endothelial cell injury biomarker, kidney injury biomarker and intestinal&#xD;
      injury biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is the difference of the duration of vasopressor between the two groups.&#xD;
      The secondary is the proportion of reduction in vasoactive-inotropic score at 72h between the&#xD;
      two groups. Other exploratory variables include the the proportion of reduction in&#xD;
      vasoactive-inotropic score at other time points, the serum level of cytokines and organ&#xD;
      injury biomarkers, and clinical outcomes between the two groups.&#xD;

    <description>Compare the proportion of reduction in vasoactive-inotropic score (VIS) from enrollment to 72 hours after enrollment between the two groups. VIS = dopamine dose * 1 + dobutamine dose *1 + norepinephrine dose *100 + epinephrine dose * 100 + milrinone dose *10 + vasopressin dose x 10000. All above medication doses are calculated with the unit of mcg/kg/min.</description>
