  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the accuracy of the condition suggestions and urgency advice of the&#xD;
      Swahili language Ada symptom assessment application (SAA), when symptoms are input by a&#xD;
      lay-person user and a medical professional; these SAA results will then be compared to the&#xD;
      condition suggestions and urgency advice of different tiers of doctors and a &quot;gold standard&quot;&#xD;
      created by a panel.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There will be two different wings of this study: (1) where a lay-person inputs their symptoms&#xD;
      into the Swahili language Ada symptom assessment application (SAA); (2) where the usual care&#xD;
      doctor asks a lay-person (the patient) the same questions from the SAA and determines their&#xD;
      own condition suggestions based off this questioning and the SAA's condition suggestions. In&#xD;
      both wings, the patient will be seeing their usual care doctor for a diagnosis and then a&#xD;
      study-provided physician for a diagnosis. Separately, the doctors will list a ranking of&#xD;
      other considered condition suggestions (diagnoses) and urgency advice, which will not be&#xD;
      shared with the patient. These condition suggestions and urgency advice will be compared to a&#xD;
      &quot;gold standard&quot;, which will be determined by a high level panel for each patient's case,&#xD;
      based on the doctor notes and physical examination results of each patient's visit.&#xD;

    <description>In Wing B only, while using the Ada HDA, the difference between the usual care doctor's condition suggestion accuracy and urgency advice will be compared between (1) the study arm where they determine a ranked list of condition suggestions before seeing Ada's list and then will choose a new ranked list based on viewing Ada's list, and (2) the study arm where after using the HDA, the doctor will see Ada's ranked list of condition suggestions and then choose to use Ada's full list or add some condition suggestions of their own. The accuracy of these will then also be compared to the study-provided physician and the gold standard panel.</description>

    <description>This device is a medical device but will be used only observationally--this device takes a patient's symptoms into account by asking questions and gives a ranked list of likely conditions that the patient might have based on the answers to these questions. The assessment report also includes urgency advice levels, that is, which care the patient should proceed to based on the condition suggestions. The WRA is used by the patient directly and the HDA is used by the doctor to ask the questions to the patient.</description>

        Patients will only be included if they are waiting in the clinic waiting room of the&#xD;
        hospital where this study will take place. Inclusion of patients will be monitored&#xD;
        throughout the study in order to ensure recruitment of a study sample of patients with a&#xD;
        comprehensive spectrum of symptoms constellations and conditions: this is to ensure that&#xD;
        this pilot study tests the performance of SAA on a broad range of scenarios. Study&#xD;
        recruitment will be carried out to a target of enrolling between 2-5 patients for 10&#xD;
        different body system categories (including at least one adult and one child in each&#xD;
        category).&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with severe injury/illness requiring immediate treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with traumatic injury (many of these patients require minimal anamnesis, and&#xD;
             it is not rational to include them in a pilot study)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients incapable of completing a health assessment (e.g. due to illiteracy, mental&#xD;
