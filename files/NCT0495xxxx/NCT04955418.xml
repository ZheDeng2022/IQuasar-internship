  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Perineal injury is the most common maternal obstetric complication associated with vaginal&#xD;
      delivery. Perineal traumas are associated with maternal morbidity, including pain, urinary&#xD;
      and fecal incontinence, genital prolapses, dyspareunia, physical and psychological&#xD;
      impairment. EPI-NO is a device with the objective of preparing and training the pelvic floor&#xD;
      for normal childbirth, this training allows smooth and slow movement along the perineal&#xD;
      structures in the prenatal period, by causing a rapid traumatic laceration during childbirth.&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to verify the effect of 10 pelvic stretching rows with Epi-No&#xD;
      in preventing urinary incontinence and dyspareunia 6 months after delivery. The study group&#xD;
      will consist of primiparous, over 18 years of age, between 30 and 32 weeks of gestation, will&#xD;
      be evaluated before the intervention and 6 months after delivery. The control group will be&#xD;
      evaluated only once, in the sixth month after delivery. The evaluation will consist of:&#xD;
      anamnesis, physical examination (vaginal examination and palpation), perineometry,&#xD;
      International Urinary Incontinence Questionnaire (ICIQ-UISF), Visual Analogue Scale for&#xD;
      dyspareunia; Questionnaire for assessing dyspareunia Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI).&#xD;
      Pregnant women referred for intervention will perform 10 sessions (twice a week for 5 weeks)&#xD;
      of perineal preparation with the Epi-No device. It is expected at the end of the study to&#xD;
      prove the effectiveness of the effect of 10 pelvic lengthening graft with Epi-No in relation&#xD;
      to the degrees of laceration and episiotomy and, consequently, reduction of urinary&#xD;
      incontinence and dyspareunia.&#xD;

    <description>The study group was evaluated before the intervention (between 30 and 32 weeks) and 6 months after delivery.From the 34th week onwards, they performed 10 sessions (twice a week for 5 weeks) of perineal preparation with the Epi-No device. The pregnant woman was placed in the supine position and EPI-NO® was inserted into vaginal canal. After the introduction of the deflated tube, it was minimally inflated until the perception in the vaginal canal. The first 5 minutes were for perception of the pelvic floor with 10 contractions and relaxation of the perineum in order to maintain muscle strength. After 15 minutes for stretching the perineum, the device was gradually inflated and always respecting the pregnant woman's tolerance. After a total of 20 minutes, the pregnant woman was asked to relax the pelvic floor in order for the inflated device to gently exit her vaginal cavity. The perimeter was measured using a tape measure in its largest diameter.</description>
