  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to support long-term dentinal hypersensitivity (DH) relief&#xD;
      claims of 0.454 percent (%) stannous fluoride (SnF2) containing toothpastes in China.&#xD;

      This study will be a single centre, randomised, controlled, examiner-blind, 3 treatment arm,&#xD;
      parallel group design study, stratified by maximum baseline Schiff sensitivity score (of the&#xD;
      2 selected 'test teeth'), with a treatment period of 8 weeks, to investigate the clinical&#xD;
      efficacy of a SnF2 dentifrice in the reduction of DH in a Chinese population. The SnF2 test&#xD;
      dentifrice will be compared to commercialised negative and positive control dentifrices.&#xD;
      Participants will be instructed to brush teeth with their assigned dentifrice according to&#xD;
      the product use instructions provided. DH assessments will be conducted at Baseline, 4 and 8&#xD;
      weeks. Participants will also be requested to complete a short-form version of the Dentine&#xD;
      Hypersensitivity Experience Questionnaire (DHEQ-15) at the Baseline and Week 8 Visits.&#xD;

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Schiff Sensitivity Score at Week 8 (Test Dentifrice Versus [vs.] Negative Control)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Schiff sensitivity score will be assessed by participant's response to an evaporative (air) stimulus after the stimulation of 2 selected test teeth, response of participant will be scored using Schiff sensitivity scale range of 0-3; 0=Participant does not respond to air stimulation; 1=Participant responds to air stimulus but does not request discontinuation of stimulus; 2=Participant responds to air stimulus and requests discontinuation or moves from stimulus; 3= Participant responds to stimulus, considers stimulus to be painful, and requests discontinuation of the stimulus. A reduction in Schiff Sensitivity score will be indicative of an improvement in sensitivity. The change from baseline in Schiff sensitivity score will be analysed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with treatment as a factor and baseline Schiff sensitivity score as a covariate.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Tactile Threshold at Week 4 and 8 (Test Dentifrice vs. Negative Control)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4 and 8</time_frame>
    <description>Constant pressure will be administered using Yeaple Probe. At baseline the upper test limit is 20 gram (g) and at Week 4 and 8, the upper test limit is 80g. The tactile threshold is the maximum pressure applied without the participant reporting pain or discomfort. The tactile threshold for 2 selected test teeth will be determined by asking the participant whether the sensation caused discomfort. The pressure setting at which the participant gave two consecutive 'yes' responses will be recorded as the tactile threshold. The greater the tactile threshold, the less sensitive the tooth. The change from baseline in Tactile Threshold will be analysed using ANCOVA with treatment as a factor and baseline Tactile Threshold score including factor as a covariate</description>
