      The aim of this study is to determine the level of awareness of the physiotherapist in the&#xD;
      society during the COVID-19 process.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 is an infectious disease that affects the respiratory system caused by the new&#xD;
      SARS-Cov-2 corona virus, which originated in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. On January 30, 2020,&#xD;
      the World Health Organization (WHO) declared it is an epidemic, and on March 11, 2020, it was&#xD;
      described as a COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respiratory problems such as fever (89%), cough (68%), fatigue (38%), phlegm production (34%)&#xD;
      and/or shortness of breath (19%) may be considered as the primary symptoms seen in&#xD;
      individuals with COVID-19 . Other rare symptoms include hemoptiziness, loss of appetite,&#xD;
      nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, muscle pain, headache, odor or taste disorder,&#xD;
      conjunctivitis, and confusion. Complications common due to COVID-19 include acute respiratory&#xD;
      distress syndrome, acute kidney damage, anemia, heart failure and secondary infection. The&#xD;
      most common cause of death was reported to be multiple organ dysfunction syndrome followed by&#xD;
      cardiac arrest, respiratory failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptoms seen in COVID-19 fall within the scope of pulmonary rehabilitation. Pulmonary&#xD;
      rehabilitation provides benefits for all patients who suffer from any chronic respiratory&#xD;
      disease, have reduced lung function, are symptomatic and have exertion intolerance, despite&#xD;
      an optimal pharmacological treatment. The importance of rehabilitation after COVID-19 is&#xD;
      emphasized according to the International Classification of Functionality, Disability and&#xD;
      Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent reports indicated that 80% of cases were asymptomatic or mild, 15% severe (oxygen&#xD;
      required infection) and 5% were critical (respiratory and life support). Intensive care unit&#xD;
      (ICU) admission rates are approximately 5%. Oxygen therapy is required in approximately 42%&#xD;
      of hospitalized patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hospitalized COVID-19 patients often have comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease and&#xD;
      diabetes and have long hospital stays. Some COVID-19 patients have physical impairments that&#xD;
      can be exacerbated by prolonged inactivity, including muscle weakness, neurological disorder&#xD;
      and/or malnutrition. In-hospital rehabilitation is proposed to tackle these problems and&#xD;
      solve them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A series of cases from Wuhan, China, reported that 20% of hospitalized patients with approved&#xD;
      COVID-19 required intensive care. Similar figures were reported in Italy-Lombardy, where 16%&#xD;
      of COVID-19 patients require intensive care unit (ICU) care. Early rehabilitation&#xD;
      intervention prevents the complications that may arise because of hospitalization in ICU&#xD;
      related to COVID-19 and can reduce or even eliminate the negative effects on daily life of&#xD;
      patients. Respiratory muscle atrophy and diaphragm dysfunction are quite common in patients&#xD;
      requiring long-term bed rest and mechanical ventilation. It has been documented that the&#xD;
      respiratory function during the admission has a negative correlation with mortality and the&#xD;
      duration of treatment in ICU is shortened from an average of 20.4 days to 12.8 days after the&#xD;
      improvement in respiratory function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple symptoms may occur approximately 3 months after the onset of symptoms in&#xD;
      hospitalized or non-hospitalized patients due to COVID-19. This situation indicates its&#xD;
      existence as &quot;post-COVID-19 syndrome&quot;. It emphasizes the presence of insufficiently met&#xD;
      healthcare services and the need for rehabilitation in patient groups who have experienced&#xD;
      &quot;mild&quot; or &quot;severe&quot; COVID-19. Physiotherapy and rehabilitation have an important line in these&#xD;
      health services. Liu et al. In their study, it was reported that there was a significant&#xD;
      improvement in respiratory function, quality of life and anxiety levels in patients as a&#xD;
      result of the rehabilitation program that included 6-week respiratory muscle training,&#xD;
      secretion excretion, diaphragm training, stretching exercises and home exercises after&#xD;
      COVID-19. In the light of this information, the importance of physiotherapists in treatment&#xD;
      is inevitable in improving the functional disorders of individuals with COVID-19 in both&#xD;
      acute and chronic periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the studies that mention that lifestyle diseases such as obesity, insulin&#xD;
      resistance, diabetes and hypertension are associated with increased risk of hospitalization&#xD;
      and death, there are suggestions that the presence of high aerobic capacity may be protective&#xD;
      in a severe COVID-19 picture. In line with the examinations made in the USA and Italy; The&#xD;
      presence of at least one lifestyle-related comorbidity of individuals infected with COVID-19&#xD;
      is 94% in the USA, while this figure is 99% in Italy. Improving lifestyle behaviors,&#xD;
      preventing, and controlling comorbidities; It has been proven to reduce the risk of premature&#xD;
      death and the progression of chronic diseases, improve quality of life, and provide&#xD;
      significant economic benefits. Physiotherapists, who play a major role in preventive&#xD;
      measures, may not be able to prevent catching COVID-19 with exercise training, but they can&#xD;
      provide a shorter recovery with less severe symptoms. Due to the risk of transmission during&#xD;
      the COVID-19 period, it is recommended to use telerehabilitation-based approaches to&#xD;
      implement exercise training and rehabilitation program. Studies on telerehabilitation have&#xD;
      emphasized the importance of telerehabilitation-based approaches in the physiotherapy and&#xD;
      rehabilitation practices of individuals with both COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the study conducted in post-COVID-19 patients in Hubei, China; when asked about&#xD;
      the rehabilitation awareness and willingness information source, 68.9% of the patients stated&#xD;
      that they were not aware of rehabilitation before, the rest were from medical personnel&#xD;
      (22.1%), online media (22.1%), and family or friends (1.4%) reported that they received&#xD;
      information about rehabilitation. This is evidence of insufficient awareness in patients.&#xD;
      After obtaining the basic information about rehabilitation, 38.9% of the patients wanted to&#xD;
      receive rehabilitation treatment while they were in the hospital, 45.4% agreed to receive&#xD;
      rehabilitation after discharge, and only 15.7% are not currently seeking rehabilitation.&#xD;
      Based on these data, it can be said that it is necessary to provide the society with access&#xD;
      to rehabilitation information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many studies and reviews on the role of physiotherapists during COVID-19. From the&#xD;
      beginning of 2020, we know how important rehabilitation activities are in the care of&#xD;
      COVID-19 patients, in recently published recommendations. Therefore, there is an urgent need&#xD;
      to increase academic and public awareness of physiotherapy and its different fields of&#xD;
      action, work environments. Special emphasis should also be placed on raising awareness of&#xD;
      physiotherapy considering the current challenges faced.&#xD;
