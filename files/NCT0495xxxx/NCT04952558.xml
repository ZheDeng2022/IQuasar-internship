      Introduction The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] is increasing worldwide. Both&#xD;
      Crohn's disease [CD] and ulcerative colitis [UC] are therefore becoming an important public&#xD;
      health issue[1] The IBD is characterized by chronic intestinal inflammation, which can cause&#xD;
      bowel damage and intestinal complications primarily depending on the duration and severity of&#xD;
      the inflammation[2] The diagnosis of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) is often established&#xD;
      following considerable delay due to nonspecific and inconsistent symptoms. In previous&#xD;
      western studies, the delayed diagnosis was associated with poor outcome in patients with&#xD;
      Crohn's disease (CD).[2] Timely diagnosis is not only important for the patients themselves&#xD;
      but has also become a relevant public health issue due to the rising incidence of IBD&#xD;
      worldwide[3] Patients and methods Cross sectional observational study will be conducted among&#xD;
      700 patients of Egyptian inflammatory bowel diseased patients for different regions Aim of&#xD;
      the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Estimate time delay for diagnosis of Egyptian inflammatory bowel diseased patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. compare the delay time for diagnosis of Egyptian inflammatory bowel diseased patients&#xD;
           globally&#xD;

      Introduction The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] is increasing worldwide. Both&#xD;
      Crohn's disease [CD] and ulcerative colitis [UC] are therefore becoming an important public&#xD;
      health issue[1] The IBD is characterized by chronic intestinal inflammation, which can cause&#xD;
      bowel damage and intestinal complications primarily depending on the duration and severity of&#xD;
      the inflammation[2] The diagnosis of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) is often established&#xD;
      following considerable delay due to nonspecific and inconsistent symptoms. In previous&#xD;
      western studies, the delayed diagnosis was associated with poor outcome in patients with&#xD;
      Crohn's disease (CD).[2] Timely diagnosis is not only important for the patients themselves&#xD;
      but has also become a relevant public health issue due to the rising incidence of IBD&#xD;
      worldwide[3] Abdominal pain is the most prevalent initial chief complaint in patients with&#xD;
      CD; however, it is also a common symptom of other digestive disorders, such as irritable&#xD;
      bowel syndrome may the pain is not severe, it is easily regarded as trivial, and the&#xD;
      diagnosis may be missed because the tests needed for the diagnosis of IBD are not performed.&#xD;
      [4] A delayed diagnosis of CD may incur high medical cost in patients who develop aggressive&#xD;
      disease that requires treatment with anti-TNFÎ± agents[5] Aim of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Estimate time delay for diagnosis of Egyptian inflammatory bowel diseased patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. compare the delay time for diagnosis of Egyptian inflammatory bowel diseased patients&#xD;
           globally&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. studing risk factors that causing diagnostic delay among Egyptian inflammatory bowel&#xD;
           diseased patients the time&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. frequency of diagnosed complicated inflammatory bowel diseased as first time&#xD;
           presentation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and methods Cross sectional observational study will be conducted among 700 patients&#xD;
      of Egyptian inflammatory bowel diseased patients for different regions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria Egyptian inflammatory bowel diseased patients above the age of 18 years&#xD;
      with definite diagnosis based on clinical ,endoscopic ,histological basis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed history will be taken from all included patients focus on&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  lag time for reaching the proper diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease which definite&#xD;
           as time from the first symptoms presentation to reaching definite diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  symptoms that causing patients seeking medical advice&#xD;
&#xD;
