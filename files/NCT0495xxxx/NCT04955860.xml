      This study aims to evaluate and compare the inclination of the lower and upper permanent&#xD;
      first molars and the transversal width of the lower and upper jaws in individuals of&#xD;
      different age groups to evaluate whether the existing anomaly at different ages in&#xD;
      individuals with a bilateral posterior crossbite. For this reason, first molar tooth&#xD;
      inclination and lower and upper jaw transversal width will be evaluated in adolescent and&#xD;
      post-adolescent individuals with a bilateral posterior crossbite.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The maxillary dental arch covers the mandibular arch in every space like a box cover in&#xD;
      normal occlusion. The transversal disappearance of this relationship is called a crossbite.&#xD;
      If this deformity occurs between posterior group teeth, it is defined as a posterior&#xD;
      crossbite. In other words, in posterior crossbite, while the teeth are in centric occlusion,&#xD;
      the vestibule tubercles of the upper posterior teeth come into contact with the central fossa&#xD;
      of the lower posterior teeth. This occlusal discrepancy may concern only one tooth, or it may&#xD;
      involve multiple teeth or all teeth. A posterior crossbite can be observed unilaterally or&#xD;
      bilaterally and is usually caused by insufficient width of the upper jaw compared to the&#xD;
      lower jaw.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Crossbite; stated that it is a term used for the abnormal buccal, labial, or lingual&#xD;
      relations of the lower and upper jaw teeth or tooth groups when the lower and upper dental&#xD;
      arches are in the closing state. Crossbite is divided into two groups as anterior and&#xD;
      posterior crossbite according to the region in the mouth. Anterior crossbite indicates&#xD;
      malocclusion of the jaws and/or dental arches in the sagittal direction, while posterior&#xD;
      crossbite indicates malocclusion in the transversal direction. Posterior crossbite is defined&#xD;
      as the contact of the buccal tubercles of the posterior maxillary teeth with the lingual&#xD;
      tubercles of the opposite mandibular teeth. This anomaly can be seen unilaterally or&#xD;
      bilaterally and may involve one or more teeth. In addition, although the canines were&#xD;
      anterior teeth before, these teeth were included in the posterior region while expressing&#xD;
      posterior crossbite. A posterior crossbite can be seen in the primary, mixed, and permanent&#xD;
      dentition period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Posteroanterior (PA) cephalograms are the most readily available and reliable diagnostic tool&#xD;
      for the radiological identification and evaluation of transversal irregularities.&#xD;
      Traditionally, orthodontists have focused on two-dimensional lateral cephalograms; however,&#xD;
      treatment is done in all three planes. A planar assessment of the transverse space cannot be&#xD;
      made unless the PA cephalogram is analyzed. Typically, standard PA cephalograms were not used&#xD;
      as part of routine diagnostic recordings. However, PA radiographs should be added as an&#xD;
      additional recording material in individuals with a posterior crossbite.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Digital radiographs and digital photographs are becoming the norm in orthodontic records.&#xD;
      Recent developments also include electronic working models. Because the medical and dental&#xD;
      anamnesis, digital photos, radiographs, and all treatment notes were in digital format have&#xD;
      become desirable to obtain digital study models. Dental cast models have a long and proven&#xD;
      history in orthodontics. It has become the &quot;gold standard&quot; in orthodontics with many&#xD;
      advantages, from cast models that can be mounted on an articulator for a three-dimensional&#xD;
      study, from routine dental examination to ease of manufacture, cheapness, and ease of&#xD;
      measurement. Digital operating models offer advantages that include storage and reassessment,&#xD;
      ease of cross-transmission, and possibly equal or better diagnostic capabilities. In&#xD;
      addition, linear dental anatomical measurements were obtained from plaster and digital&#xD;
      models, while Bolton analysis was performed on the cast and digital models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning of the treatment, dental plaster models obtained from the lower and upper&#xD;
      jaw dimensions will be scanned with a three-dimensional model scanning device (3 Shape R700&#xD;
      3D Scanner, 3 Shape A/S, Copenhagen, Denmark). Scanned models will be analyzed with the&#xD;
      3Shape Orthoanalyzer program (3Shape A/S, Copenhagen, Denmark). A point will be placed on the&#xD;
      distal, facial, mesial, and lingual surfaces of each tooth, from the right first permanent&#xD;
      molar to the left first permanent molar in the same arch. These points will be chosen by the&#xD;
      rules established by Moyers et al. and Brust and McNamara to determine the geometric center&#xD;
      of each tooth, the tooth center. This point provides a broader arc width measurement because&#xD;
      it will eliminate the effect of tooth rotation. After cast rotation, the first molars' facial&#xD;
      and lingual cusp crests will be selected to assess molar tooth tilt and angulation. An&#xD;
      inclination below 180 degrees indicates that the molars are inclined buccally, while values&#xD;
      above 180 degrees indicate that these teeth are inclined lingually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dental arch width measurements will be measured between the following teeth: permanent&#xD;
      canines, first premolars, second premolars, and permanent first molars. Arch width will be&#xD;
      evaluated with two sets of measurements: the distance from the lingual point of the selected&#xD;
      tooth to the similar point on its antimere and between the centroid and antimer of a tooth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The arch depth shall be measured as the distance from the midpoint between the facial&#xD;
      surfaces of the central incisors to the tangent line to the mesial surfaces of the first&#xD;
      permanent molars. Arch circumference will be determined by summing the segments between the&#xD;
      points of contact from the mesial surface of the first permanent molar to the mesial surface&#xD;
      of the opposite first permanent molar.&#xD;
