    <textblock>
      Community college students are an underserved and at-risk population in terms of their sexual&#xD;
      and relationship health. This is a three-arm randomized control trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      long-term efficacy of a web-based sexual and relationship health promotion program among U.S.&#xD;
      community college students (expected N = 2010) and explore the mechanisms underlying the&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Community college students are an underserved and at-risk population in terms of their sexual&#xD;
      and relationship health. One promising avenue for improving sexual decision making among this&#xD;
      population is media literacy education (MLE). Though studies show MLE is an effective&#xD;
      approach to sexual health promotion there is a need to better understand the mechanisms by&#xD;
      which MLE programs impact health outcomes. The ultimate goals of this study are to 1) advance&#xD;
      theoretical frameworks of media literacy to better understand the underlying mechanisms that&#xD;
      lead to sexual health behavior change and 2) enhance the sexual and relationship health of&#xD;
      community college students by identifying successful methods of health promotion and&#xD;
      strategies to implement health programs at community colleges. This study is a three-arm&#xD;
      randomized control trial (RCT) with 2010 community college students (ages 18-19) from 30&#xD;
      colleges across the U.S. All components of this study (i.e., interventions, surveys) are&#xD;
      web-based.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating students will be randomized to one of three conditions: 1) students who receive&#xD;
      a sexual health program grounded in MLE (Media Aware); 2) students who receive a sexual&#xD;
      health program with no MLE; and 3) a wait-list control group. Participants will complete&#xD;
      pretest, posttest, 6-month follow-up, and 12-month follow-up surveys to examine changes&#xD;
      across the three groups in our primary outcomes (e.g., risky sexual behavior) and secondary&#xD;
      outcomes (e.g., sexual health knowledge, rape myth acceptance, perceived realism of media&#xD;
      messages).&#xD;
