  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are benefits to early, intensive treatment of IA. But getting to treatment depends on&#xD;
      timeline and accurate case identification. The longest delays occur in persons&#xD;
      self-identifying the need to see care for IA, recognition of these cases by primary care&#xD;
      providers (PCPs), and appropriate, timely referral to rheumatology. Current methods of&#xD;
      improving time to referral and consultation are effective, but costly and unsustainable, so&#xD;
      there is need to look for alternatives. One solutions may be the use of patient&#xD;
      self-administered tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we will test whether the use of validated, self-administered patient&#xD;
      questionnaires (self-assessment) can advance the urgency rating of referrals for people with&#xD;
      inflammatory arthritis (IA). If urgency ratings can be advanced then self-assessment may have&#xD;
      the potential to reduce wait times to see a rheumatologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Canada, one in every hundred people has IA and hundreds of new patients are diagnosed each&#xD;
      year. Wait times to see a rheumatologist are long, so anything that has the potential to&#xD;
      reduce these wait times would have a significant impact.&#xD;

    <description>When a rheumatologist receives a new referral, he/she gives it an &quot;urgency rating&quot;, which indicates how soon the patient needs to be seen based on information they have about the patient in the referral letter. Urgency rating has four levels: 1) urgent, schedule patient within 4 weeks, 2) urgent, schedule patient in 4 to 6 weeks, 3) urgent, schedule patient in 6 to 12 weeks, 4) non-urgent, schedule patient after 12 weeks. These were developed by the Canadian Rheumatology Association. Please note that these are NOT time points, but ratings used to describe how soon a patient should be seen.&#xD;
Urgency rating will be recorded by the rheumatologist after three different cases: 1) After the rheumatologist receives the patient's referral letter, 2) after the patient arrives for their first appointment and completes a self-assessment in the waiting area, and 3) after the rheumatologist completes their first physical assessment of the patient.</description>

    <description>Rheumatologist reviews both the self-administered tender joint count (out of 68 joints on a homunculus) and self-administered Early Inflammatory Arthritis Detection Tool that were completed by the patient. Rheumatologist then uses the information provided in these tools by the patient to determine whether they should advance the urgency rating of the case.</description>
