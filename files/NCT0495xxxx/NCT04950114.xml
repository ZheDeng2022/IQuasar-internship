  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label Phase 2 study evaluating the long term safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      GFB-887 in patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), and treatment-resistant&#xD;
      minimal change disease (TR-MCD)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be enrolled from the ongoing GFB-887 multiple ascending dose trial.&#xD;
      Participants will be maintained on the same dose received in the previous study although the&#xD;
      data review team (DRT) and Medical Monitor may elect to decrease or increase the dose to&#xD;
      minimize adverse events or improve clinical efficacy. The DRT may also elect to change dosing&#xD;
      levels due to emerging data on GFB-887. Participants will take GFB-887 once daily at home. A&#xD;
      phone visit will be conducted at Week 4 and at Week 8 to assess safety and tolerability.&#xD;
      Participants will return to the clinic for follow up visits at Weeks 12, 24, 36, 48, and&#xD;
      every 24 weeks thereafter through approximately 3 years from the time of the participant's&#xD;
      first dose to evaluate long-term safety and durability of response (for up to approximately&#xD;
      13 scheduled in-clinic visits).&#xD;

             enrollment following consultation with the Medical Monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who enrolled in any other interventional study during the time between&#xD;
             completion of the prior GFB-887 interventional study and this study may be considered&#xD;
             for enrollment following consultation with the Medical Monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant is unable to take oral medications&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has an unstable medical condition based on medical history, physical&#xD;
             examination, laboratory tests, ECGs, vital signs or is otherwise unstable in the&#xD;

             with study evaluation, procedures, or completion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of significant hypersensitivity, intolerance, or allergy to any component of&#xD;
             investigational product GFB-887&#xD;
