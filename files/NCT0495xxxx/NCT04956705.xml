  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nursing home residents are in high risk of vitamin D deficiency, which negatively affects&#xD;
      bone health. Vitamin D and calcium supplements have shown to increase bone density and reduce&#xD;
      fracture risk and may affect daily physical functioning. Therefore, The Danish Health&#xD;
      Authority recommends all nursing home residents a daily supplement of 20 µg vitamin D and&#xD;
      800-1000 mg calcium. However, adherence to the recommendation is low.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present project hypothesizes that this low adherence results in a high number of&#xD;
      residents with a deficient or insufficient vitamin D status, and that daily physical&#xD;
      functioning can be improved or maintained by an improved adherence to the recommendation.&#xD;

      Background: Residents in nursing homes belong to one of the high-risk groups when it comes to&#xD;
      vitamin D deficiency, which is associated with increased risk of osteoporosis, muscle&#xD;
      weakness and generally decreased physical functioning and frailty. Therefore, the Danish&#xD;
      Health Authority recommends that all residents in nursing homes receive a daily supplement of&#xD;
      20 µg of vitamin D in addition to 800-1000 mg of calcium. Some systematic reviews and&#xD;
      meta-analyses find that daily supplementation of 20 µg of vitamin D can improve physical&#xD;
      functioning and muscle strength among older adults, whereas others do not find an effect.&#xD;
      However, most studies are performed in non-institutionalized older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An online survey conducted in May 2020 has revealed that the recommendation of giving&#xD;
      residents in nursing homes a daily supplement of 20 µg vitamin D and 800-1000 mg calcium is&#xD;
      not routine clinical practice in Denmark. The Danish Health Authority highlights The Model&#xD;
      for Improvement as a tool to use when working with evidence-based practice within prevention&#xD;
      and health promotion in the municipalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To increase use of the recommended supplements with vitamin D and calcium among&#xD;
           residents at nursing homes using The Model for Improvement as a methodological tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the effect of improved vitamin D and calcium supplement use on vitamin D&#xD;
           status and daily physical functioning among residents at nursing homes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vitamin D status among residents at nursing homes are low and the majority can be&#xD;
           defined as vitamin D insufficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vitamin D status and daily physical functioning of the residents are positively affected&#xD;
           by an improved implementation of the recommendation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and Methods: The project has a quasi-experimental design without control groups. It&#xD;
      estimates the causal impact of The Model for Improvement on implementing the specific&#xD;
      recommendation in a realistic setting at the nursing homes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes the following endpoints related to the older adults at the nursing homes&#xD;
      evaluated before and after the intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of residents at the participating nursing homes taking supplementation of ≥20 µg&#xD;
           of vitamin D and/or ≥800 mg of calcium ≥5 days/week.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of residents at the participating nursing homes classified as having an&#xD;
           insufficient and deficient vitamin D status (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D &lt;50&#xD;
           nmol/L and &lt;25 nmol/L, respectively)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mean daily physical functioning measured as muscle strength, 30-s chair-stand test, and&#xD;
           a timed-up-and-go test.&#xD;
