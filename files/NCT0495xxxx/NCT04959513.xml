    <textblock>
      When the practitioners have to place an implant, it is necessary to have a sufficient amount&#xD;
      of bone. This study propose to manage clinical situations by an approach using guided bone&#xD;
      regeneration using an L-PRF bone block (composite graft composed of a xenograft, a membrane&#xD;
      from the patient's blood and a collagenous membrane) after a short healing period of 6 to 8&#xD;
      weeks after tooth extraction. Alveolar ridge changes will be evaluated regarding soft and&#xD;
      hard tissues up to 6 months.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      When the practitioners have to place an implant, it is necessary to have a sufficient amount&#xD;
      of bone. After a tooth extraction, a bone remodeling process leads to a resorption of the&#xD;
      various sockets components. The spontaneous healing of an extraction may result in an&#xD;
      unsuitable site for the implant placement. It is therefore sometimes necessary to perform an&#xD;
      alveolar ridge preservation (ARP) at the time of extraction at the future implant site to&#xD;
      compensate for this natural resorption. However, some clinical situations don't allow ARP&#xD;
      (infection, significant bone loss, etc.) at the time of extraction. In these situations where&#xD;
      alveolar preservation is not indicated and bone augmentation is required to recover or&#xD;
      preserve correct bone anatomy for implant placement, other techniques must be used. Thus, in&#xD;
      this study, the investigators propose to manage these clinical situations by an approach&#xD;
      using guided bone regeneration using an L-PRF bone block (composite graft composed of a&#xD;
      xenograft, a membrane from the patient's blood and a collagenous membrane) after a short&#xD;
      healing period of 6 to 8 weeks after tooth extraction. This early approach allows soft tissue&#xD;
      healing (easier primary closure to cover the graft), take advantage of the residual bone&#xD;
      architecture of the socket (only at the beginning of its resorption) and allows infection&#xD;
      resorption at the extraction site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcomes are the volumetric changes of the soft and hard tissue. To evaluate this&#xD;
      volumetric changes, 3 CBCTs and 3 digital impressions will be made at 3 different times:&#xD;
      before extraction, before guided bone regeneration and before implant placement (5 to 8&#xD;
      months after regeneration).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited at Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc, participation will be&#xD;
      voluntary without any obligation. To be included in the experiment, patients will have to&#xD;
      have at least one tooth from the antero-superior sector that must be extracted with the need&#xD;
      for pre-implant bone regeneration. This need for guided bone regeneration will be based on a&#xD;
      three-dimensional radiological examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The chronology of the experiment is :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. First consultation to make the diagnosis, explain the experiment and sign the informed&#xD;
           consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 1st CBCT (Cone Beam Computed Tomography) and 1st digital impression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Surgery: extraction of tooth(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. 2nd CBCT, digital impression and control of the healing of the extraction site 10 to 15&#xD;
           days after extraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Surgery: Guided bone regeneration 6 to 8 weeks after extraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Control of the healing of the site 10 to 14 days after regeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. 3rd CBCT, 3rd digital impression 5 to 8 months after regeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Surgery: Implant placement. The data analysis will be done clinically with control&#xD;
           visits after the different surgeries and volumetrically with CBCTs and optical&#xD;
           impressions. The impressions and the radiographic images will be analysed used dedicated&#xD;
           application (MeVisLab for the CBCTs and Gom Inspect for the impressions).&#xD;

    <description>Volumetric analysis of hard tissue using CBCT. They will be performed before extraction (T0), before guided bone regeneration (T1) and 6 months after regeneration before implant placement (T2). The CBCT done at T0 will be used as a reference for comparison with the CBCT T1 and T2. A high-resolution scanning protocol will be used with fixed exposure parameters and the CBCT will be adjusted to the target area to allow a significant reduction in irradiation dose. The DICOMs (Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine) will be analysed using a dedicated application. The images taken at different times will be superimposed with an automatic algorithm and compared by 2D and 3D volumetric measurements.</description>
