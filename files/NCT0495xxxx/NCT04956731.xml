  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a pilot study among two pharmacists providing start to finish medication&#xD;
      abortions to 10 patients utilizing a previously created toolkit. Following completion of the&#xD;
      pilot, we will perform in-depth semi-structured interviews with the participating patients&#xD;
      and pharmacists to understand their experiences with pharmacist provision of medication&#xD;
      abortion. In addition, we will elicit feedback about ways to refine the toolkit to support&#xD;
      the scale-up of pharmacist provision of medication abortion in the future.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will conduct a 'proof of concept' pilot study. Participating patients will be counseled by&#xD;
      a trained pharmacist who will provide Mifepristone 200 mg and two doses of 800 mcg of&#xD;
      Misoprostol. Patients will be instructed to take the 800 mcg of misoprostol buccally 24-48&#xD;
      hours after their Mifepristone. Patients whose estimated gestational age is between 64 and 70&#xD;
      days will be instructed to take the additional dose of 800 mcg of misoprostol 4 hours after&#xD;
      the first dose. Patients who estimated gestational age is 63 days or less will be instructed&#xD;
      to take the additional dose of 800 mcg of misoprostol if they do not experience at least&#xD;
      moderate bleeding within the first 24 hours following their first misoprostol dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will complete a brief 5-10 minute telehealth visit with a registered physician&#xD;
      Mifepristone prescriber. The standard Mifepristone consent form will be signed at this time&#xD;
      and the patient will then be instructed to take the Mifepristone orally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be contacted one week after receiving treatment by the providing&#xD;
      pharmacist. If the participant history suggests concern for a continuing pregnancy, ectopic&#xD;
      pregnancy or worrisome bleeding, they will be scheduled for in person evaluation. If the&#xD;
      participant does not indicate any concern, they will be instructed to use the high&#xD;
      sensitivity urine pregnancy test four weeks after taking their misoprostol. If the&#xD;
      participant's first high sensitivity urine pregnancy test is positive but they have no&#xD;
      symptoms concerning for ongoing pregnancy, they will be instructed to perform a second, high&#xD;
      sensitivity urine pregnancy test in one week. If the second, high sensitivity urine pregnancy&#xD;
      test is also positive, the patient will be evaluated in person.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will continue our study by performing in-depth semi-structured interviews with the&#xD;
      participating patients and pharmacists to understand their experiences and elicit feedback&#xD;
      about ways to refine the toolkit. We will follow a prepared interview guide.&#xD;
