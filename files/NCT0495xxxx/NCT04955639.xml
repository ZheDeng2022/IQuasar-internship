  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Two-arm, parallel-group, non-crossover, single-center pilot randomized controlled trial,&#xD;
      enrolling up to 180 participants to evaluate the effect of the Pivot smoking cessation&#xD;
      program (intervention) compared to usual care (commercially available app smoking cessation&#xD;
      program plus optional nicotine replacement therapy, control).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present pilot randomized controlled trial compares user engagement and retention, change&#xD;
      in attitudes towards quitting smoking, change in smoking behavior and participant feedback in&#xD;
      adult smokers randomized either to the Pivot (intervention) or commercially available&#xD;
      (control) smoking cessation programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to assess participants' use of Pivot program and commercially available program. There&#xD;
      will be a focus on assessing use and engagement, changes in attitudes towards quitting&#xD;
      smoking and changes in smoking behavior over the course of the 2-year study, as well as&#xD;
      participant feedback on the set-up, design, use experience, and impact of each program.&#xD;
