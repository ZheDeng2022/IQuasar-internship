    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b, multicenter, open-label, pharmacokinetic (PK), and safety study of&#xD;
      multiple oral doses of oral decitabine and cedazuridine (formerly known as ASTX727) as a&#xD;
      fixed-dose combination of decitabine 35 mg and cedazuridine 100 mg in cancer participants&#xD;
      with severe renal impairment and cancer participants with normal renal function as matched&#xD;
      control subjects. Adult participants with acute myeloid lymphoma (AML), myelodysplastic&#xD;
      syndrome (MDS), or solid tumors who are candidates to receive oral decitabine and&#xD;
      cedazuridine will be enrolled in this study. Study duration is approximately up to 8 weeks.&#xD;
