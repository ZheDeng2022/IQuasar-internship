      To evaluate the clinical outcomes of arthroscopic and open Chinese Unique Inlay Bristow&#xD;
      procedure in treating recurrent anterior shoulder instability.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recurrent anterior dislocation of the shoulder joint is a common disorder of the shoulder&#xD;
      joint. Patients with recurrent anterior dislocation of the shoulder severely affect movement&#xD;
      and quality of life, and severe cases can lead to severe dysfunction of the shoulder joint.&#xD;
      Nowadays, arthroscopic Bankart surgery is routinely used to treat such patients. However, the&#xD;
      recurrence rate of shoulder dislocation with conventional arthroscopic Bankart repair is high&#xD;
      in professional athletes with very high levels of athleticism and in complex patients with&#xD;
      large glenoid bone defects. For this population, coracoid transfer surgery (Bristow-Latarjet&#xD;
      procedure) is currently considered to have better efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Latarjet procedure is now relatively well established internationally; however, this&#xD;
      technique has a large osteotomy block and uses two hollow screws to fix the bone block. This&#xD;
      is very traumatic and cannot be used in patients with small coracoid, and there is a high&#xD;
      incidence of postoperative bone resorption of the bone block, and in the event of severe bone&#xD;
      resorption, the screws left behind are more damaging to the subscapularis tendon. In&#xD;
      contrast, the Bristow procedure is relatively less invasive, but the early healing rate of&#xD;
      the grafted bone block is lower than that of the Latarjet procedure. In response to this&#xD;
      problem, the group improved the Bristow procedure in a previous clinical study by using an&#xD;
      embedded technique to fix the bone block, which is the first of its kind in the world, and&#xD;
      the investigators named it the Chinese Unique Inlay Bristow (Cuistow) procedure. The&#xD;
      description and clinical results of this procedure have been accepted by the American Journal&#xD;
      of Sports Medicine, and the technique is now a routine procedure in our department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is still some debate as to whether the classical coracoid procedure should be performed&#xD;
      arthroscopically or open. Open surgery is more traumatic, but relatively easy to perform,&#xD;
      with a shorter operative time and a shorter learning curve to master the technique;&#xD;
      arthroscopic surgery is less traumatic, with faster recovery, but relatively more expensive&#xD;
      and requires higher surgical skills. Some studies have concluded that there is no significant&#xD;
      difference between the two in terms of long-term postoperative outcomes and complications. In&#xD;
      our previous study, the investigators found that the use of our first &quot; Mortise and Tenon&#xD;
      structure &quot; bone displacement fixation resulted in better early postoperative stability and&#xD;
      higher postoperative bone healing rates than the traditional coracoid transfer procedure.&#xD;
      However, it is unknown whether there is a difference in clinical outcomes and postoperative&#xD;
      bone healing rates using open surgery compared to arthroscopic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, a prospective observational study was conducted in which the advantages and&#xD;
      disadvantages of arthroscopic and open surgery for Cuistow procedure were explained to the&#xD;
      patient before surgery, and then the patient chose one of the surgical approaches according&#xD;
      to his or her own wishes. The functional recovery and bone resorption of the two groups were&#xD;
      compared, and the two surgical approaches were evaluated to determine whether there were&#xD;
      significant differences in postoperative bone healing rates and clinical outcomes between the&#xD;
      two surgical approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, the aim of this study was to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of the&#xD;
      two surgical approaches through a comparative study. The investigators wish to provide a&#xD;
      complete systematic solution for the treatment of difficult and complex recurrent anterior&#xD;
      shoulder dislocations, and to provide an effective remedy for cases of recurrence after&#xD;
      Bankart surgery.&#xD;
