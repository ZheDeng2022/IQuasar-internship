  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study in Nepal will evaluate if non-specialists participating in Equip-based&#xD;
      Problem Management Plus training show greater competencies compared to non-specialists&#xD;
      participating in standard Problem Management Plus training. The proposed study is a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial with mixed-methods components evaluating both quantitative&#xD;
      outcomes and qualitative outcomes among non-specialists participating in the training and&#xD;
      their trainers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is increasing recognition of the high burden of psychological distress among&#xD;
      populations around the world. Increasingly, non-specialists (persons who do not have&#xD;
      expertise in formal mental health training) are being used to deliver psychological services.&#xD;
      There is a long history of successful implementation of psychological services by&#xD;
      non-specialists in Nepal. Recently, a cluster randomized controlled trial of Problem&#xD;
      Management Plus showed modest benefit over enhanced care as usual in southeastern Nepal. A&#xD;
      recent initiative by the World Health Organization is being rolled out to improve the&#xD;
      competencies of non-specialists participating in Problem Management Plus and similar&#xD;
      trainings. This initiative is Ensuring Quality in Psychological Services (Equip). The&#xD;
      proposed study in Nepal will evaluate if non-specialists participating in Equip-based Problem&#xD;
      Management Plus training show greater competencies compared to non-specialists participating&#xD;
      in standard Problem Management Plus training. The proposed study is a randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial with mixed-methods components evaluating both quantitative outcomes and qualitative&#xD;
      outcomes among non-specialists participating in the training and their trainers.&#xD;
