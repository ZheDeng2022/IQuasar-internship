    <textblock>
      The pain experience and its associated mechanisms in people with knee osteoarthritis (OA) are&#xD;
      known to be complex and multidimensional. The current understanding of OA pain mechanisms is&#xD;
      incomplete, resulting in limited pain management strategies. There is high-quality evidence&#xD;
      that suggests the use of exercise for people with knee OA can provide a reduction in pain,&#xD;
      changes in quality of life, and have modest improvements in physical function. There is&#xD;
      promising evidence to support that yoga for those with knee OA may improve pain intensity,&#xD;
      function, and stiffness. The aim of this study is to establish the feasibility of a pain care&#xD;
      yoga program, in addition to education for improving pain modulation. The data collected will&#xD;
      be used to inform a pilot and feasibility randomized controlled trial (RCT) prior to a multi&#xD;
      site RCT to assess the program's effectiveness with the primary outcome of descending&#xD;
      modulation as a mediator of change in pain severity.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise is regularly utilized as a first-line treatment for knee osteoarthritis, and its use&#xD;
      is supported by high quality evidence to improve pain and function. Reductions in perceived&#xD;
      pain can be explained in part by exercised-induced analgesia, which is thought to be mediated&#xD;
      via numerous endogenous pathways. Furthermore, decreased nervous system sensitivity to&#xD;
      noxious stimuli seem to play a role in the decreased pain experience of individuals who&#xD;
      engage in exercise. These mechanisms likely play a role in improved function and reduced pain&#xD;
      along with the improved balance, muscle strength and flexibility that are conventionally&#xD;
      associated with exercise. In recent years multiple guidelines for non-surgical management of&#xD;
      knee OA have begun to include mind-body therapies, such as yoga or tai-chi, as conditional or&#xD;
      core treatment recommendations. Structured yoga programs have been shown to result in&#xD;
      decreased pain and improved function when compared to no exercise and conventional exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BDNF is a neurotrophin that appears to play an important role in the central modulation of&#xD;
      pain in adults, and altered expression of BDNF is likely to play an important role in the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of chronic pain. Individuals with knee OA have been shown to possess altered&#xD;
      levels of serum BDNF compared to healthy controls, indicating that BDNF may be implicated in&#xD;
      the pain-experience of patients with knee OA. Thus, BDNF has been identified as a therapeutic&#xD;
      target in the treatment of pain resulting from central sensitization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NGF is a neurotrophin known to play a critical role in the proper development of the nervous&#xD;
      system. Evidence indicates that NGF is also involved in the increased pain experience of many&#xD;
      individuals via peripheral sensitization of nociceptive neurons. Therefore, NGF levels have&#xD;
      been shown to be elevated in a wide variety of chronic pain conditions including knee OA.&#xD;
      Anti-NGF therapies are being highly studied as they have significant potential to decrease&#xD;
      pain and improve function in individuals with OA that do not respond to conventional&#xD;
      analgesics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to establish the feasibility of a pain care yoga program, in&#xD;
      addition to education for improving pain modulation. The data collected will be used to&#xD;
      inform a pilot and feasibility randomized controlled trial (RCT) prior to a multi site RCT to&#xD;
      assess the program's effectiveness with the primary outcome of descending modulation as a&#xD;
      mediator of change in pain severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Is the pain care yoga and education program feasible in terms of recruitment rate,&#xD;
           treatment adherence, timelines, data collection procedures, patient follow-up and&#xD;
           resources required?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Is the pain care yoga and education program feasible in terms of patient's satisfaction&#xD;
           and acceptability?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      A convenience sample of 15 adults will be sought and is adequate to evaluate the feasibility&#xD;
      of the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited through the email lists of the McMaster Physical Activity&#xD;
      Centre of Excellence (PACE) community. Recruitment posters will also be included in the&#xD;
      McMaster Institute for Research on Aging (MIRA) newsletter. In addition, we will place&#xD;
      postings on both PACE and MIRA social media pages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting&#xD;
&#xD;
      The in-person 8-week exercise program will be held twice weekly at McMaster University's&#xD;
      Physical Activity Centre of Excellence (PACE) located in the Ivor-Wynne Centre. Participants&#xD;
      will complete the pain assessment, and have blood drawn at PACE by PACE staff who are&#xD;
      certified phlebotomists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of participation in the study, participants will be asked to attend an assessment at&#xD;
      the beginning of the study, and once again upon completing the 8-week exercise program.&#xD;
      Participants will undergo pain modulation (CPM) testing, a 40 Metre Walk Test to assess&#xD;
      walking speed and gait, and the 30 Second Sit to Stand Test to determine leg strength and&#xD;
      endurance. Lastly, participants will have their blood drawn at the beginning and end of the&#xD;
      study. Participants will then be asked to complete a series of questionnaires about their&#xD;
      pain and mood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exit Survey and Focus Group&#xD;
&#xD;
      A satisfaction survey will be conducted at the end of the program to evaluate the a priori&#xD;
      feasibility criteria. Participants who indicated upon initially consenting to the study that&#xD;
      they would like to participate in a focus group, will be contacted. Qualitative data&#xD;
      collection will be used to explore participants experience and perceptions of the feasibility&#xD;
      and acceptability of the program. A focus group will be conducted using audio or video&#xD;
      recording (using Zoom), lasting between 45-60 minutes.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Pain Modulation</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pain modulation will be assessed through conditioned pain modulation. First an ascending measure of pressure pain threshold (PPT) inducing a verbal pain rating of 3 out of 10 will be evaluated at the anterior shin on the unaffected knee. Next a conditioning stimulus in the form of forearm ischemia will be applied to induce a minimum verbal pain rating of 5 out of 10 at the opposite volar forearm. The arm will be elevated to chest level with a blood pressure cuff around the middle of the upper arm. Systolic pressure will be determined. Next the cuff will be inflated to 20mmhg above systolic pressure and the participant will be asked to squeeze a stress ball until a pain rating of 5/10 is reported. Once pain rating is recorded, PPT at the anterior shin will be repeated as the cuff remains inflated. An index will be created by subtracting the first PPT reading from the last. Negative values are indicative of pain inhibition. Positive values indicate pain facilitation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Pain Intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pain intensity will be measured using the numeric rating scale. The average of three questions will be used: average pain intensity in the past 24 hours, past week, and worst pain in the past 24 hours. Questions are rated on a an 11-point scale where patients select a rating between 0-10 with zero typically represents 'no pain' while 10 represents the 'worst imaginable pain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Function</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Function will be measured using the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score. The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score has 42 items in 5 scored sub scales, of which two will be used: 1) pain, and 2) function in daily living (ADL). Scores range from 0-100 with zero representing extreme knee problems and 100 representing no knee problems.</description>
