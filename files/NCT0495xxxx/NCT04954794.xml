      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TACE combined with&#xD;
      Sintilimab plus bevacizumab biosimilar in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma as&#xD;
      first-line therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is commonly used for the treatment of advanced&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma. Early randomized trials suggested that TACE can be accepted as the&#xD;
      standard treatment for advanced-stage disease. However, the outcome of patients treated with&#xD;
      TACE in real-life cohorts is still very poor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have also supported a safe combination of immune checkpoint inhibition with&#xD;
      TACE. And the combination of sintilimab plus bevacizumab biosimilar showed significantly&#xD;
      improved survival in advanced HCC. Therefore, the objective of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of TACE combined with anti-PD-1 antibody in patients in advanced&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma.&#xD;
