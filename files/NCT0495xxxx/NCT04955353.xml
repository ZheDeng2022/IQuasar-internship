  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Joint pain and disease affect more than one in four adults in the United States. We conducted&#xD;
      a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to investigate the efficacy of a&#xD;
      hydrolyzed chicken collagen type II (HCII) supplement in reducing joint-related discomfort&#xD;
      such as pain and stiffness, and in improving mobility. We enrolled adults aged 40-65y (65.5%&#xD;
      were women) who had joint discomfort, but had no co-morbidities, and were not taking pain&#xD;
      medications. The participants were randomized to receive either the HCII supplement (n=47) or&#xD;
      a placebo (n=43) for eight weeks. At baseline, week 4, and week 8, we administered the&#xD;
      Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) survey with three&#xD;
      additional wrist-related questions and the Visual Analog Scale for assessments of&#xD;
      joint-related symptoms.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Joint pain and disease affects more than one in four adults in the United States. Hydrolyzed&#xD;
      Chicken Collagen Type II, hereinafter referred to as HCII, may repair or regenerate&#xD;
      deteriorating collagen, and therefore, help address the underlying cause of joint discomfort.&#xD;
      This study evaluated the efficacy of Avicenna's patented Hydrolyzed Chicken Collagen Type II&#xD;
      product, hereinafter referred to as AVC-H2, in the reduction of joint pain &amp; stiffness and&#xD;
      improvement in joint function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BioScreen Clinical Services conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.&#xD;
      90 participants were enrolled, 47 in the AVC-H2 group and 43 in the placebo group; aged 40-65&#xD;
      with overall joint discomfort but no co-morbidities were enrolled. Participants in both&#xD;
      groups took two pills in the morning and evening for 8 weeks. The Western Ontario and&#xD;
      McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) survey with the addition of 3 questions&#xD;
      pertaining to the wrist and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain assessment were conducted at&#xD;
      baseline, week 4, and week 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The product used was Avicenna's Hydrolyzed Chicken Collagen Type II raw material product. The&#xD;
      techniques used to create AVC-H2 mimic the body's natural hydrolysis process for ease of&#xD;
      digestion and optimum low molecular weight. AVC-H2 protein consists of protein bonds that&#xD;
      have been broken down or &quot;untied&quot; so that they are more easily absorbed by the small&#xD;
      intestines. The total collagen in the product is â‰¥ 70%, making it a highly pure product, in&#xD;
      comparison to other collagen products that were tested prior to the study. Total collagen&#xD;
      content of AVC-H2 was based off of certificates of analyses prior to the study. As such, a&#xD;
      smaller dosage was administered to participants compared to previous studies of similar&#xD;
      products. Participants in the study were randomly assigned to receive either 2.5g of AVC-H2&#xD;
      daily or a matching amount of placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intent to Treat Analysis and Sensitivity Analysis were both used. Intent to Treat Analysis&#xD;
      included all study participants and Sensitivity Analysis removed participants who broke&#xD;
      protocol and those who initially claimed they had 0 joint pain &amp; stiffness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the investigators' knowledge, Avicenna's study appears to be the first to assess the&#xD;
      efficacy of HCII on joint discomfort in the wrist and in individuals not taking additional&#xD;
      pain medications.&#xD;

    <description>The WOMAC survey is used to assess joint-related discomfort at baseline. Our version of WOMAC score (adding up from all domains) can range from 0 (min) to 108 (max). The lower the number, the better the outcome (less joint-related discomfort).</description>
