  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study primarily aims to determine the status of vaccination in enrolled cancer&#xD;
      patients and identify barriers to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination in cancer&#xD;
      patients who have not been vaccinated. Secondary objectives include determining the rate of&#xD;
      vaccination in those who have ever been COVID-19 positive and those who have never been&#xD;
      COVID-19 positive. The study team also seeks to determine factors associated with&#xD;
      vaccine-acceptance and vaccine-hesitancy in the adult cancer population, identify side&#xD;
      effects of COVID-19 vaccines in vaccinated cancer patients and to examine the effect of&#xD;
      COVID-19 vaccination on overall clinical outcome in cancer patients. The study team will be&#xD;
      conducting telephone interviews/surveys with up to130 adult cancer patients for data&#xD;
      collection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, there is a void in literature regarding the rates of coronavirus disease 2019&#xD;
      (COVID-19) vaccination in cancer patients. The investigators aim to address this question by&#xD;
      elucidating rates of vaccination in the general Penn State Cancer Institute (PSCI) patient&#xD;
      population as well as patients from the COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium (CCC-19) who are known&#xD;
      to have had previous COVID-19 infection. There is a wealth of information regarding the&#xD;
      general population's uptake of COVID-19 vaccines, but there is not nearly as much information&#xD;
      regarding cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple studies are seeking to find factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in&#xD;
      the general population. There are very few published studies that have specifically examined&#xD;
      factors associated with vaccine hesitancy (or barriers to vaccination) in cancer patients.&#xD;
      The investigators aim to identify barriers to COVID-19 vaccination in the adult cancer&#xD;
      population. Further, a comparison between vaccine acceptance and/or hesitancy in patients&#xD;
      with prior known COVID-19 positivity and those without prior COVID-19 positivity has not been&#xD;
      conducted yet, to the knowledge of the study team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the safety and efficacy profiles of COVID-19 vaccination in cancer patients has&#xD;
      yet to be determined. Admittedly, the efficacy profile of COVID-19 vaccination is an ongoing&#xD;
      process and situation. One study did determine that only 1 dose of the&#xD;
      Pfizer-Biopharmaceutical New Technologies was not efficacious in producing positive&#xD;
      anti-Spike protein titers 21 days after a single vaccine inoculum. Only 21 of 56 solid cancer&#xD;
      patients and 8 of 44 hematological cancer patients sero-converted after a single dose. The&#xD;
      general findings here were that patients with cancer need an early or day 21 second dose of&#xD;
      the Pfizer vaccine in order for positive anti-S titers to be present in their blood. It is&#xD;
      still unknown if these patients or those in the general population will require annual (or&#xD;
      another time-frame) boosters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study does aim to establish a safety profile in those PSCI patients who have been&#xD;
      vaccinated, as the investigators will be inquiring about side effects from vaccination. There&#xD;
      is little information available about the safety profile of COVID-19 vaccination in cancer&#xD;
      patients. The investigators will be asking participants about the side effects they may have&#xD;
      experienced after vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One known side effect that may have an impact on cancer treatment and outcomes includes&#xD;
      axillary and supraclavicular lymph node enlargement. According to this study, more patients&#xD;
      who received the Moderna Inc. vaccine had ipsilateral axillary lymphadenopathy (lymph node&#xD;
      enlargement in the same side that the vaccine was administered) than those who received the&#xD;
      Pfizer vaccine. The investigators will be surveying patients to examine whether or not this&#xD;
      phenomenon occurred in PSCI patients and what the outcome was (no change in treatment, delay&#xD;
      in treatment, stoppage of treatment, for example).&#xD;
