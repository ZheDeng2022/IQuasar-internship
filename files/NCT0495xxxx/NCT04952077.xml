  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral infarction by proximal occlusion of the anterior circulation is common with major&#xD;
      personal and societal consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI is the gold standard for exploring stroke, especially ischemic, and a number of&#xD;
      biomarkers on initial MRI (before reperfusion) are predictive of neurological prognosis.&#xD;
      However, their spatiotemporal evolution in the suites of reperfusion is unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Close monitoring by MRI would make it possible to precisely know the tissue, vascular and&#xD;
      microvascular evolution of the infarct area and the penumbra after reperfusion, and thus to&#xD;
      characterize MRI biomarkers associated with efficient tissue reperfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the MR-Reperfusion study is to characterize new MRI biomarkers of efficient tissue&#xD;
      reperfusion.&#xD;
