      This study retrospectively analyzed the relationship between the preoperative optical&#xD;
      coherence tomography(OCT) and optical coherence tomography angiography(OCTA) software related&#xD;
      parameters of patients with idiopathic macular hole, the patient's own clinical data and the&#xD;
      best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) for at least one month after surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After Pars plana vitrectomy combined with removal of the internal limiting membrane (ILM) and&#xD;
      air filling, it can not only promote the closure of the macular hole in patients with&#xD;
      idiopathic macular hole, but also improve the visual acuity of the affected eye. There are&#xD;
      various studies to predict the visual acuity of patients after surgery recovery, but due to&#xD;
      many factors that affect the effect of macular hole surgery, the improvement of visual acuity&#xD;
      after retinal surgery varies greatly in different eyes. As a new type of ophthalmology&#xD;
      device, OCTA plays an important role in measuring the size of the hole and the changes of&#xD;
      retinal capillaries. Therefore, this study intends to calculate patient parameters based on&#xD;
      OCT and OCTA equipment. Statistical software was used to analyze the relationship between&#xD;
      each parameter and the best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) for at least one month after&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
