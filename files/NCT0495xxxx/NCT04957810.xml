  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on the home rehabilitation exercise of patients undergoing ACL reconstruction, the&#xD;
      existing WeChat applet of sports medicine of the Third Hospital of Beijing Medical University&#xD;
      is optimized to be used as a health education tool to guide patients undergoing home&#xD;
      rehabilitation exercise after ACL reconstruction.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With the development of national fitness and sports, the incidence of ACL injury is&#xD;
      increasing year by year. ACL reconstruction is the best way to treat ACL injuries, and the&#xD;
      success rate of the operation is high, but patients still need to recover after surgery,&#xD;
      otherwise, it will be difficult to fully restore knee joint function. However, my country's&#xD;
      rehabilitation medical resources are obviously insufficient. After discharge from the&#xD;
      hospital, ACL reconstruction patients usually go home and exercise at home according to the&#xD;
      rehabilitation plan formulated by the surgeon or rehabilitation physician. However,&#xD;
      compliance is still poor, and rehabilitation is relatively difficult to achieve the expected&#xD;
      results, which affects the lives of patients quality. The WeChat official account and its&#xD;
      affiliated mini-programs have been widely used in different health fields as a means of&#xD;
      health communication. The health belief model is a guiding theory commonly used in the field&#xD;
      of health education to guide patients to make behavior changes. This study intends to use the&#xD;
      functional advantages of the WeChat applet to explore the optimization of the existing Peking&#xD;
      University Third Hospital Sports Medicine WeChat applet based on the health belief model and&#xD;
      to use the postoperative rehabilitation of patients undergoing ACL injury reconstruction as a&#xD;
      pilot to evaluate the optimized The WeChat Mini Program can improve the intervention effect&#xD;
      of patients' home functional exercise compliance after ACL injury reconstruction, to provide&#xD;
      effective health education for more extensive sports medicine-related home functional&#xD;
      exercises, improve their rehabilitation effects and quality of life, and better To ensure the&#xD;
      efficacy of surgery.&#xD;
