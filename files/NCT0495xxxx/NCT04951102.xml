  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will increase knowledge about the feasibility and effect on patient satisfaction&#xD;
      and clinical outcomes of using an electronic Shared Decision Making (SDM) application (app)&#xD;
      for patients with asthma in the allergy/immunology clinic visit setting. SDM is defined as an&#xD;
      approach where clinicians and patients share the best available evidence when faced with the&#xD;
      task of making decisions, and where patients are supported to consider options and make&#xD;
      informed choices.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 1 week of completing asthma shared decision making app worksheet and their asthma clinic visit</time_frame>
    <description>Patient satisfaction as determined by Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire responses. Questions will consist of the SDM-Q-9 (psychometrically validated measures for shared decision-making from the perspectives of patients), questions regarding satisfaction with content covered during the visit, and questions regarding satisfaction with the overall communication between the patient and physician.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physician satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 1 week of patient visit</time_frame>
    <description>Physician satisfaction as determined by Physician Satisfaction Questionnaire responses. Questions will consist of the SDM-Q-DOC (psychometrically validated measures for shared decision-making from the perspectives of health care providers), questions regarding satisfaction with content covered during the visit, and questions regarding satisfaction with the overall communication between the patient and physician. Physicians will receive a small number of satisfaction questionnaires, randomly assigned after patient visits, no more than one a week.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in level of asthma control as determined by patient follow up asthma control test questionnaire responses regarding interval changes in asthma control, use of systemic steroids, and urgent care and emergency visits for asthma.</description>

    <description>The electronic Asthma SDM App will ask questions related to medicine-related, non-medicine-related, and COVID-19-related concerns about patients' asthma, the patients' personal goals for asthma control and expectation for their upcoming visit, and the patients' preferred level of details and involvement in coming to a decision about their asthma treatment. They may also use the Asthma SDM app to find information about asthma, medication management, COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines.</description>
