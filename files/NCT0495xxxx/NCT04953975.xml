  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Functional dyspepsia (FD) is a common functional gastrointestinal disease. Several&#xD;
      patient-reported outcome questionnaires have been established to evaluate the severity of FD,&#xD;
      including Dyspepsia Symptom Severity Index (DSSI), Nepean Dyspepsia Index (NDI), and&#xD;
      Short-Form Nepean Dyspepsia Index (SF-NDI). Functional Dyspepsia Symptom Diary (FDSD) is a&#xD;
      newly symptom-focused patients-reported outcome measure raised by the Patient-Reported&#xD;
      Outcome Consortium's Functional Dyspepsia Working Group. The association of the novel FDSD&#xD;
      and other scores-related to FD has not been fully investigated. Furthermore, the severity of&#xD;
      FD is varied among different patients. It remains unclear how the moderate and severe FD can&#xD;
      be defined by the FDSD.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Dyspepsia Symptom Diary</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The FDSD consists of 5 cardinal items (burning in the stomach, stomach pain, bloating, postprandial fullness, and early satiety) and 3 supplementary items (nausea, burping/belching rating, and burping/belching bother). Each item can be scored from 0 (no) to 10 (worst). Total Symptom Score includes the 5 cardinal items and ranges from 0 to 50.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The GSRS contains 15 items. All individual items are scored on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = not at all to 7 = extremely) and are subsequently clustered into five domains (abdominal pain, reflux, indigestion, diarrhea, and constipation); higher scores indicate more severe symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dyspepsia Symptom Severity Index (DSSI)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The DSSI contains 20 items. All individual items are scored on a 5-point Likert scale (0 = not at all to 4 = extremely) and are subsequently clustered into three domains (Dysmotility-like, Reflux-like, and Ulcer-like); higher scores indicate more severe symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Short Form of Nepean Dyspepsia Index (SF-NDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-NDI consists of 10 questions regarding the effects of dyspepsia symptoms (&quot;stomach problems&quot;) on different aspects of life (tension, interference with daily activities, eating/drinking, knowledge/control, and work/study). Each response can be from 1 (not at all affected) to 5 (extremely affected), or 0 (N/A), for a total summed score out of 50.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Severity of FD judged by patients</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
