  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of PD research is to develop disease-modifying drugs to delay or prevent the&#xD;
      underlying neurodegenerative process. Levodopa, as the gold standard for PD treatment, is&#xD;
      associated with the occurrence of motor complications. Many previous studies have confirmed&#xD;
      that Stalevo can reduce the side effects of levodopa alone. Moreover, the effects of Stalevo&#xD;
      on the treatment of PD patients have been extensively studied, but the efficacy of Stalevo in&#xD;
      early PD patients has been less studied. Therefore, it is necessary to further study the&#xD;
      treatment of early PD with Stalevo, and observe whether increasing the number of medication&#xD;
      can reduce the occurrence of dyskinesis. The research results will help to deepen the&#xD;
      understanding of Stalevo in the treatment of early PD and its clinical efficacy.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The occurrence and frequency of dyskinesia of participants in two groups were assessed by blind method.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The duration of the study is 96 weeks. Follow-up: Baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, 24 weeks, 36 weeks, 48 weeks, 60 weeks, 72 weeks, 84 weeks, 96 weeks. At each visit, the doctor performs a blind assessment of dyskinesia. The proportion of patients with no dyskinesias in the two groups at each visit was recorded. The Kaplan-Meier line was used to analyze the relationship between the drug and the occurrence of dyskinesia.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The Movement Disorder Society-Sponsored Revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) of participants in two groups were assessed by blind method.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>At each visit, the patient completed the MDS-UPDRS. The doctor performs a blind assessment of MDS-UPDRS parts II, III, and IV. MDS-UPDRS part II, Motor Experiences of Daily Living (13 items); part III, Motor Examination (33 items); and part IV, Motor Complications. (6 items). All items have five response options with uniform anchors of 0 = normal, 1 = slight, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, and 4 = severe. The more severe the symptoms, the higher the score.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The 9-Item Wearing-Off Questionnaire （WOQ-9） score of participants in two groups were assessed by blind method.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>During the double-blind period, subjects completed WOQ-9 at each visit. WOQ-9 was used to assess symptoms of wearing-off. The nine symptoms include tremor, anxiety, mood changes, slowness of movement, reduced dexterity, general stiffness, pain/aching, slowness of thinking , and muscle cramping. The presence of one of these symptoms and relief after the next dose is indicative of wearing-off.</description>
