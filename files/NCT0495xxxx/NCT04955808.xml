    <textblock>
      This research trial studies how well biospecimen collection works in identifying genetic&#xD;
      changes in patients with breast, prostate, colorectal, liver, or kidney cancer or multiple&#xD;
      myeloma undergoing surgery. Studying samples collected during surgery may add to the&#xD;
      understanding of cancer by looking for the genetic changes that cause early cancer onset in&#xD;
      people of certain racial and ethnic groups.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To acquire tissue and blood, and other biospecimens for research purposes during&#xD;
      procedures for clinical care to accelerate our understanding of the molecular basis of early&#xD;
      onset cancers occurring in racial and/or ethnic minority populations through the application&#xD;
      of genome analysis technologies, including large- scale genome sequencing and clinical data&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo collection of tumor tissue during surgery. Patients also undergo blood&#xD;
      samples. Samples collected may undergo genetic analysis including whole exome sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed for up at 6 and 12 months.&#xD;
