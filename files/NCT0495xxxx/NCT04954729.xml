  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (ECTS) is the most common epilepsy syndrome in children.&#xD;
      Language impairment has been widely investigated in patients with ECTS, but little is known&#xD;
      about the cognitive dysfunction of processing speed and its neuroimaging mechanism.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVE To investigate the processing speed dysfunction in patients with ECTS, and the&#xD;
      associated brain functional abnormality using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)&#xD;
      and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This study prospectively enrolled ECTS patients (n = 28)&#xD;
      from June 2019 and June 2021. Twenty age- and gender- matched healthy children and another&#xD;
      twenty children with extracranial tumors were enrolled as controls. Patients with ECTS and&#xD;
      healthy controls underwent neuropsychological testing and fMRI examination. In addition, ECTS&#xD;
      patients and children with extracranial tumors underwent 18F-FDG PET examination.&#xD;
