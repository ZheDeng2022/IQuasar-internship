    <textblock>
      Individuals who had COVID-19 and are thought to have recovered from the disease often&#xD;
      experience long-term symptoms such as fatigue, extreme tiredness and shortness of breath, a&#xD;
      condition referred to as Long COVID. Previous studies have shown that regular exercise is&#xD;
      beneficial for individuals suffering similar symptoms as a result of other diseases such as&#xD;
      Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. The goal of this study is determine if participation in a&#xD;
      three-month structured exercise program will improve physical function in individuals&#xD;
      suffering from Long COVID.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In December of 2019, a previously unknown betacoronavirus was discovered in the airways of&#xD;
      patients with pneumonia in Wuhan, China. The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by&#xD;
      the virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)) spread rapidly around&#xD;
      the world. Common symptoms include cough, fever, dyspnea (i.e. shortness of breath),&#xD;
      musculoskeletal aches and pains and fatigue. These symptoms, most notably fatigue and&#xD;
      dyspnea, have been reported months after the onset of the disease and often long after&#xD;
      patients are thought to have recovered from the disease. Between one and two thirds of&#xD;
      patients with milder forms of the disease report symptoms up to two months after the onset of&#xD;
      symptoms. This condition is now referred to as Long COVID or Post- Acute Sequelae of&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the characteristic symptoms of this condition are dyspnea and&#xD;
      extreme fatigue. Additionally, pulmonary, musculoskeletal, neurological, cardiac, and&#xD;
      psychological sequelae in these survivors can affect their physical function and ability to&#xD;
      perform activities of daily living. While exercise rehabilitation in patients recovering from&#xD;
      COVID-19 has been cautiously recommended, there is little known about the response to&#xD;
      exercise in patients with Long COVID-19 nor the optimal methods or strategies for&#xD;
      rehabilitating these patients. Understanding the responses to an exercise program is&#xD;
      instrumental in designing safe and effective rehabilitation strategies for these patients.&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to examine the effect of a 3-month exercise therapy program on&#xD;
      physical function in individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 between the previous 2 to 6&#xD;
      months, yet still report symptoms of the disease. The study is a randomized,&#xD;
      wait-list-control pilot study designed to gather preliminary data. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomized into one of two groups: an immediate treatment group or a wait-list-control group.&#xD;
      The immediate treatment group will begin the exercise therapy program following randomization&#xD;
      and will participate in the exercise program for a duration of three months. The&#xD;
      wait-list-control group will receive usual care for the first three months, after which they&#xD;
      will be allowed the opportunity to participate in the exercise therapy program for three&#xD;
      months. Outcome measures will me made prior to randomization and following either the&#xD;
      three-month exercise program or three months of usual care.&#xD;

    <description>Each exercise session will involve 5 to10 minutes of stretching and slow walking followed by a 30 minute stimulus phase of aerobic exercise. Exercise intensity during the stimulus phase will be prescribed based on the graded exercise test results and will be gradually increased with the goal of the participant exercising continuously for 30 minutes at 50% to 85% of symptom-limited maximum heart rate, or maintained at a level below that which causes symptomatic or silent ischemia. Following the aerobic phase of exercise, participants will complete one set of 8 to 12 repetitions of muscle-strengthening activities for all major muscle groups (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders, and arms). Participants will be provided with a home based aerobic exercise program. They will be encouraged to perform this home-based program twice a week on days when they are not attending the center-based program.</description>
