  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study intends to perform round-tunnel and flat-tunnel ACL reconstruction technique in&#xD;
      144 patients, and compare the clinical outcomes of the two surgical procedures through&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized, controlled, multi-center clinical trial study on ACL&#xD;
      reconstruction surgery technique. It is jointly undertaken by the Peking University Third&#xD;
      Hospital, Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, Zhengzhou Orthopaedic Hospital, and Shenzhen Second&#xD;
      People's Hospital. Peking University Third Hospital is the team leader unit. In this study,&#xD;
      144 patients with ACL rupture were recruited according to the enrollment criteria. Among&#xD;
      them, 54 patients with ACL rupture were recruited and carried out by the Peking University&#xD;
      Third Hospital. The recruited patients were randomly divided into groups. The ratio of the&#xD;
      control group is 1:1. Each of the other three hospitals recruited 30 patients and randomly&#xD;
      grouped them according to the same enrollment criteria. The ratio of the experimental group&#xD;
      to the control group was also 1:1. In this study, 72 patients with ACL rupture in the&#xD;
      experimental group will be treated with flat-tunnel reconstruction technique, and 72 patients&#xD;
      with ACL rupture in the control group will be treated with round-tunnel technique. All&#xD;
      operations will be performed with autologous hamstring tendons. After reconstruction, all&#xD;
      subjects will participate in the collection of clinical function scores including Tegner&#xD;
      score, Lysholm score, IKDC score, and clinical evaluation including physical examination,&#xD;
      joint laxity, CT and MRI imaging analysis to verify ACL Advantages of flat-tunnel technique.&#xD;
