    <textblock>
      Melatonin is a hormone that the pineal gland in the brain produces. Melatonin fulfills many&#xD;
      functions in the body but it is mostly known for maintaining a circadian rhythm that is&#xD;
      governed by the central circadian pacemaker (biological clock) in the suprachiasmatic nuclei&#xD;
      in the hypothalamus. Melatonin works by attaching to receptors or nerve endings in the&#xD;
      suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the hypothalamus. It binds to melatonin receptor 1 and&#xD;
      melatonin receptor 2, commonly referred to as MT1 and MT2. People can take it as a natural or&#xD;
      synthetic supplement to promote restful sleep. Melatonin showed promise for preventing shifts&#xD;
      in sleep and wake times in people with jetlag and improving sleep in people with insomnia. It&#xD;
      can also be used for headaches, cancer, and Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Melatonin can be used as an analgesic, sedative, and hypnotic drug that can distinguish it as&#xD;
      an attractive alternative premedicant&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A study that was done before in J Anaesth by Borazan H et al revealed that postoperative pain&#xD;
      score in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy who received melatonin one hour before&#xD;
      surgery as a premedication was significantly lower than the control group with a significant&#xD;
      P-value( less than 0.05).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The entropy is indicated for adult and pediatric patients older than 2 years intraoperatively&#xD;
      for monitoring the electric state of the brain. In adult patients, state entropy and response&#xD;
      entropy can be used as an aid in monitoring the effects of certain anaesthetic agents which&#xD;
      will help the user to titrate the anaesthetic agent according to the individual needs of each&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the use of entropy parameters may be associated with a reduction of anaesthetic&#xD;
      use and faster emergence of anaesthesia. The entropy measurement is to be used as an adjunct&#xD;
      to other physiological parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the best of our knowledge, there is no study that examined the effect of melatonin on&#xD;
      inhaled isoflurane requirements intraoperatively. So, in this study, the effect of melatonin&#xD;
      will be assessed on intraoperative inhaled isoflurane requirements in patients undergoing&#xD;
      open nephrectomy under general anaesthesia by using entropy&#xD;
