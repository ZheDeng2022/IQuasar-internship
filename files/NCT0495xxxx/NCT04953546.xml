      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the apex of the deep cartilage (ADC) as the symbol, the consistency of the two methods&#xD;
      in the postoperatively computed tomography (CT) and microscopic evaluation of the position of&#xD;
      the femoral tract of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) was studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifty-two patients requiring arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction were&#xD;
      enrolled in the Sports Medicine Department of Peking University Third Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collect patients' basic information and preoperative conditions. During the operation, the&#xD;
      patient's knee was bent 90°, and the center point was positioned according to the intact&#xD;
      femoral stump. The horizontal distance from the ADC to the anterior bone margin (L1) and the&#xD;
      horizontal distance from the center point of the bone tract (L1) were measured by the master,&#xD;
      the first aid and the second aid, and the distance from the center point of the bone tract to&#xD;
      the lower bone margin (D1) was measured, and the ratio of L1 /L1 was calculated (P1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The horizontal distance from the ADC to the anterior bone margin (L2) and the horizontal&#xD;
      distance from the center of the bone tract (L2) were measured by three investigators on&#xD;
      postoperative CT films, and the distance from the center of the bone tract to the lower bone&#xD;
      margin (D2) was also measured, and the ratio of L2 /L2 was calculated (P2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Linear regression, Pearson correlation and Bland-Altman analysis were used to compare the&#xD;
      consistency between the endoscopic assessment and CT assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      P1 and P2, D1 and D2 were positively correlated, and the linear relationship was significant.&#xD;
      Bland-Altman diagram shows a good consistency.&#xD;
