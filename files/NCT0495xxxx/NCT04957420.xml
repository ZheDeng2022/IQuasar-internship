      This is a multicenter, prospective, non intervention post marketing surveillance study&#xD;
      conducted in Chinese mainland. The main objective was to evaluate the safety characteristics&#xD;
      of rotigotine patch in the treatment of Chinese adult patients with idiopathic Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease in real world clinical practice.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a long-term, chronic, progressive and disabling disease, which&#xD;
      affects millions of patients worldwide. The incidence rate of Parkinson's disease is about&#xD;
      20/100000 per year. With the increase of age (65 years old and above), the incidence rate of&#xD;
      the population increased significantly, reaching &gt;100/100000 per year . The average age of&#xD;
      onset is 58 to 62 years old, and the prevalence rate of people over 50 years old is about 1%.&#xD;
      Similar to the incidence rate, the prevalence of Parkinson's disease increases with age. It&#xD;
      is 1.4% at 55 years old, and 4.3% in 85 years old and above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main clinical symptoms of Parkinson's disease include tremor, myotonia, motor&#xD;
      retardation, postural reflex disorders and gait disorders, as well as a variety of other&#xD;
      motor, mental, sensory and autonomic neuropathy. Depressive symptoms of Parkinson's disease&#xD;
      are very common in patients. In the progressive stage of the disease, patients may have&#xD;
      dementia symptoms. Autonomic nervous system involvement may cause orthostatic hypotension,&#xD;
      paroxysmal flushing, thermoregulation disorders, constipation, dysphagia, bladder and sexual&#xD;
      dysfunction. Involvement of dopaminergic pathways in the thalamus and spinal cord may lead to&#xD;
      sensory abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The etiology of Parkinson's disease remains unclear. However, it is generally considered to&#xD;
      be a progressive degenerative disease, which gradually erodes the brain stem, basal ganglia&#xD;
      structure and its projection system. Pathological studies have found that there are loss of&#xD;
      dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra and neurons in locus coeruleus and raphe nucleus,&#xD;
      deposition of Lewy bodies and activation of glial cells. Basic studies suggest that oxidative&#xD;
      damage of specific neurons in basal ganglia is one of the potential causes of idiopathic&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease, and aging and genetic factors are also the main causes of the disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      Predisposing factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rotigotine ((6S) - 6 - {propyl [2 - (2-thienyl) ethyl] amino} -&#xD;
      5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-1-naphthol) is the left-handed enantiomer of chiral&#xD;
      aminotetrahydronaphthalene compounds. Rotigotine is a dopamine receptor agonist. Its dosage&#xD;
      form is designed as a transdermal drug delivery system, which can continuously release&#xD;
      rotigotine within 24 hours. Transdermal drug delivery system, which continuously releases&#xD;
      dopamine receptor agonists (such as rotigotine) in a non-invasive manner. Rotigotine has been&#xD;
      approved by global health agencies for the treatment of early and advanced Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease. Overall, ushib or authorized partners have market licenses for rotigotine&#xD;
      transdermal patches for Parkinson's disease in 70 countries. A detailed description of the&#xD;
      preclinical and clinical experience of rotigotine can be found in the investigator's manual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From February 15, 2006 to February 15, 2020, a total of 7878 participants used rotigotine as&#xD;
      part of the clinical development plan. No treatment-related risk was found in the longest&#xD;
      6-year long-term open study. Other safety features of rotigotine, including clinical and post&#xD;
      marketing data, can be found in the investigator's manual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the current policy of the Chinese government, multinational pharmaceutical&#xD;
      companies operating in China should implement drug safety monitoring within five years after&#xD;
      obtaining the registration certificate of imported drugs. This kind of research is called&#xD;
      focused drug monitoring (IDM), which aims to investigate the safety and clinical application&#xD;
      of products, including expected and unexpected adverse drug reactions (ADRs); Specific&#xD;
      adverse reactions / events are related, incidence rate, severity, risk and so on. The&#xD;
      incidence of ADR in special groups, including pregnant women, children, the elderly, patients&#xD;
      with liver and kidney damage, specific race, patients with specific genetic tendency or&#xD;
      specific complications, and other people who lack safety data of pre marketing clinical&#xD;
      studies; Other safety problems related to drug use, packaging and quality were observed.&#xD;
      During IDM, general population monitoring should be used unless there are other requirements&#xD;
      for special reasons (such as requirements or permission of drug regulatory agencies).&#xD;
      Observational studies are recommended. According to the data collection method, prospective&#xD;
      study is recommended. However, in order to collect data as comprehensively as possible,&#xD;
      prospective and retrospective studies can also be combined. Literature research can be used&#xD;
      as a brief supplement to key monitoring methods. In order to avoid information collection&#xD;
      bias during IDM, case selection should be continuous, such as collecting information of all&#xD;
      patients using drugs in a specific time period and fixed medical institutions; Other biases&#xD;
      should also be considered in planning. According to the requirements of China's State Food&#xD;
      and Drug Administration (CFDA) / State Drug Administration (nmpa), Neupro®（ The safety&#xD;
      characteristics of rotigotine patches need to be evaluated using a sample of at least 3000&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this non intervention study (NIS) was to evaluate the safety of rotigotine&#xD;
      patch in adult patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease according to the instructions in&#xD;
      routine clinical practice, so as to meet the regulatory requirements of Chinese health&#xD;
      institutions. This study will collect and monitor all adverse events (AE). Evidence of the&#xD;
      efficacy and use of rotigotine patches in the real world will also be collected with AE.&#xD;
