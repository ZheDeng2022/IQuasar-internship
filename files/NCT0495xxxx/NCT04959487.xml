  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT) of Changing Health through Food Support&#xD;
      for Diabetes (CHEFS-DM). This pragmatic RCT will leverage Project Open Hand's (POH)&#xD;
      real-world programs to test the impact of a six month medically tailored food support and&#xD;
      nutrition intervention (&quot;CHEFS-DM&quot;) on glycemic control and other cardiometabolic outcomes,&#xD;
      investigate the paths through which CHEFS-DM may durably improve health, and assess the&#xD;
      economic value of the intervention to society.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CHEFS-DM is a six-month intervention providing a diabetes-tailored diet meeting approximately&#xD;
      75% of daily energy requirements and designed based on American Diabetes Association (ADA)&#xD;
      guidelines, together with diabetes nutritional education provided by registered dietitians.&#xD;
      In this pragmatic RCT, investigators propose to rigorously evaluate the intervention among&#xD;
      440 low-income adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) recruited from networks of safety&#xD;
      net clinics in San Francisco and Alameda counties, California.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized 1:1 to the intervention (n=220) versus control (n=220), using&#xD;
      a parallel design. The study aims are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To determine the impact of CHEFS-DM on glycemic control and other cardiometabolic&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To determine the impact of CHEFS-DM on intermediate outcomes that may mediate any&#xD;
      impact of CHEFS-DM on T2DM health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant will be followed for 6 months (control arm) and 12 months (intervention arm) with&#xD;
      structured interviews, anthropometric assessments, 24-hour dietary recalls, blood pressure&#xD;
      measurements, fasting blood draws, semi structured interviews, and medical record review.&#xD;
      Follow-up will be broken up into two phases. From baseline to six months, researchers will&#xD;
      implement the CHEFS-DM intervention and follow both intervention and control arm participants&#xD;
      (n=440). After the end of the six-month follow-up, the intervention arm will transition to&#xD;
      receiving standard POH services comprising 33% to 67% of daily energy requirements depending&#xD;
      on health status, and will be followed for an additional six months, in order to assess the&#xD;
      extent to which any health benefits are sustained at 12 months (n=220). Hence, the control&#xD;
      arm will be followed for six months and participate in two sets of assessments (baseline and&#xD;
      at six months), and the intervention arm will be followed for 12 months and participate in&#xD;
      three sets of assessments (baseline, six months, and twelve months).&#xD;

    <description>Control participants will receive standard of care as offered by clinical partners to all T2DM patients, including referral to nutritional counseling, T2DM support groups, and participation in local diabetes self-management programs. Control participants are also often provided referral information for locally available food support services in the region that provide diabetes-appropriate foods. At the end of follow up, the control arm will receive similar services from POH to what the intervention arm received during the intervention, regardless POH eligibility criteria (6 months of DM-tailored food support to meet 67% of their daily requirements, video recording of the 4 CHEFS-DM education classes, and access to a POH dietitian at their request).</description>
