  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      By utilizing community-based participatory research methods, this research was conducted in&#xD;
      collaboration with the community through our partnership of researchers, educators, providers&#xD;
      and consumers (Active Collaborative Hub for Individuals with ASD to Enhance Vocation and&#xD;
      Education- ACHIEVE) to adapt a vocational soft skills program, Supported, Comprehensive&#xD;
      Cognitive Enhancement &amp; Social Skills (SUCCESS), for Transition Age Youth (TAY). The first&#xD;
      step (years 1-2) involved adapting the intervention for autistic TAY by including feedback&#xD;
      from multiple stakeholders and developing a curriculum to be implemented in both High Schools&#xD;
      and Transition programs for the specific needs of autistic TAY and alpha piloting it. It&#xD;
      involved understanding further the educational context for TAY students and current services&#xD;
      available to prepare students for secondary outcomes of employment and/or college through a&#xD;
      county wide survey. Step 2 (years 2-3) included pilot testing the feasibility, acceptability,&#xD;
      implementation procedures and initial youth outcomes of the TAY SUCCESS intervention and&#xD;
      further refining the curriculum and protocols. Findings demonstrated improvements in&#xD;
      executive functioning and social functioning targets as well as distal outcomes of&#xD;
      self-efficacy, mental health, educational and work behaviors and attitudes. The study results&#xD;
      were disseminated through the ACHIEVE group as well as at conferences, website and&#xD;
      publication.&#xD;

      Aim: With our ACHIEVE partners , develop the High School Supported, Comprehensive Cognitive&#xD;
      Enhancement and Social Skills (SUCCESS) program to fit the needs of transition-age youth with&#xD;
      ASD within the community educational system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Standardize the TAY SUCCESS program by developing a facilitator manual, student workbook&#xD;
           and corresponding support person materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Develop a training protocol that can be individualized and implemented within the HS&#xD;
           educational system to provide initial training and ongoing coaching for educators to&#xD;
           reach and sustain intervention fidelity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: Conduct a pilot study to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and implementation&#xD;
      procedures (recruitment, randomization, retention &amp; training strategies) of TAY SUCCESS and&#xD;
      to obtain estimates of effects to support a future large-scale effectiveness trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Examine intervention feasibility, acceptability, satisfaction, and sustainability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Examine preliminary outcomes (executive functioning and social functioning)&#xD;
