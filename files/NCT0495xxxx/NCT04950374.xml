  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the safety and efficacy of 2 moisturizers: a body lotion and a lip&#xD;
      moisturizer. For the moisturizer body lotion, the study aims to determine the tolerance of&#xD;
      this product by the study population, and its effects on atopic dermatitis condition, skin&#xD;
      hydration, skin barrier, skin microbiome and perceived efficacy. For the lip moisturizer, the&#xD;
      study aims to determine the tolerance of this product by the same study population and its&#xD;
      effects on the perceived efficacy. Participants will receive both products and use them at&#xD;
      home for 21 +/- 2 days.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from baseline of Atopic Dermatitis severity based on Scoring Atopic Dermatitis Index (SCORAD) to 21 ± 2 days</measure>
    <time_frame>21 ± 2 days</time_frame>
    <description>Atopic dermatitis (AD) severity based on SCORAD Index will be reported at baseline and 21 ± 2 days. The tool involves not only medical assessment, but also subjective symptom assessments reported by the subject. The index is divided into the following parts, which receives a numerical score: Extension (ares with AD lesions); Intensity of reactions (erythema, edema, exudation/crusts, abrasions, lichenification and dry skin; and Subjective Symptoms (pruritus and sleep loss). To evaluate these parameters, a scale from 0 to 10 is used. At the end, a global classification of AD is automatically attributed to each subject. Lower global scores means that less severe is the AD condition.&#xD;
This assessment will be used to determine the effect of the moisturizer body lotion on AD condition of the study population after a period of use.</description>

    <time_frame>21 ± 2 days</time_frame>
    <description>The POEM is a simple, valid, easily interpreted, and reproducible tool for assessing AD and monitoring aspects of the disease that are important to participants with AD. This tool consists in a questionnaire responded by the participants with questions related to seven AD symptoms (itchy skin, sleep disturbance, bleeding skin, skin weeping/oozing, skin flaking, skin cracking, skin dryness/roughness). Participants must respond each questions specifying how many times per week the symptoms occur using the options: none day; 1 to 2 days; 3 to 4 days; 5 to 6 days; every day. Then each response receives the one of the following scores:&#xD;
0 = no days;&#xD;
1= 1-2 days; 2 = 3-4 days; 3 = 5-6 days 4= every day. In the end, a total score is calculated by the sum of the 7 items (rating from 0 to 28). Higher scores correlates to a more severe AD condition.&#xD;
