  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Remimazolam, a novel ultra-short acting benzodiazepine that combined the advantages of&#xD;
      midazolam and remifentanil, has been developed for procedural sedation, induction and&#xD;
      maintenance of general anesthesia, and sedation in the ICU. Previous studies have suggested&#xD;
      that efficacy and safety of remimazolam are not inferior to propofol or midazolam in patients&#xD;
      undergoing colonoscopy,bronchoscopy and some other treatments. However, the efficacy and&#xD;
      potential adverse effects of remimazolam on patients undergoing endovascular procedures of&#xD;
      cerebrovascular disorders is still unclear. In this study, we tend to conduct a&#xD;
      single-center, randomized, single-blind ,non-inferiority trial to compare the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of remimazolam and propofol in endovascular procedures of cerebrovascular disorders.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Randomization is done by an investigator who is not involved in anesthesia and outcome assessment. Participants are unaware of the group allocation. Due to the different color of remimazolam and propofol, the care provider is not blinded to the group allocation. At the end of the surgery, anesthetics are removed before outcome assessment. And the outcome assessor is blinded to the grouping.</masking_description>
