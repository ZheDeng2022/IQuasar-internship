    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, Simon's 2-stage designed study with 2 cohorts of anti-PD-1/PD-L1&#xD;
      experienced patients with untreated brain metastases: 1) melanoma and 2) renal cell carcinoma&#xD;
      (RCC). The primary endpoint of this study is to determine the best intracranial response of&#xD;
      combined pembrolizumab and lenvatinib in patients with untreated brain metastases from&#xD;
      melanoma or RCC who are anti-PD-1/PD-L1--experienced. Secondary endpoints include best&#xD;
      overall objective response (combined intracranial and extracranial response),&#xD;
      progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), duration of intracranial response,&#xD;
      and rate of adverse events. Exploratory/correlative endpoints will include evaluation of&#xD;
      pre-treatment tumor tissue (either intracranial or extracranial) for immunohistochemical&#xD;
      markers (PDL-1, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, and angiogenic factors) and genetic analysis&#xD;
      of tumor mutations or mutational burden. Pre-treatment and on-treatment blood samples will be&#xD;
      collected and evaluated for biomarkers of response by cytokine profiling and transcriptomic&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients must have at least one evaluable asymptomatic intracranial lesion, no smaller than&#xD;
      5mm and no larger than 3 cm. Patients may have prior radiation to or surgical resection of a&#xD;
      symptomatic brain metastasis as long as at least one untreated lesion or unequivocally&#xD;
      growing lesion is present for response assessment. Pembrolizumab 200mg IV every 3 weeks will&#xD;
      be administered in combination with lenvatinib 20 mg PO daily for up to 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients must have received at least 2 doses of an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 mAb at some point in their&#xD;
      treatment course and must have unequivocal intracranial progression. Intracranial progression&#xD;
      in patients who are anti-PD-1/PD-L1 experienced is defined as either development of a new&#xD;
      brain lesion(s) or unequivocal progression in a previously irradiated or resected brain&#xD;
      lesion(s) site. Patients can be deemed to have progression after discussion and group&#xD;
      consensus of the case at tumor board. Secondary imaging assessments to confirm intracranial&#xD;
      progression are not required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are enrolled from sites outside of the Sponsor (Yale) must have patient&#xD;
      eligibility approved by the Sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Archival tissue from extracranial and/or CNS metastases will be obtained, if available, for&#xD;
      correlative studies. A baseline pre-treatment fresh biopsy will also be required from an&#xD;
      accessible metastasis unless there is not an easily accessible site to biopsy or if a biopsy&#xD;
      is determined to be unfeasible by the treating physician after discussion with the study PI.&#xD;
      The tumor tissue will be studied retrospectively for PD-L1 expression, TIL characteristics,&#xD;
      and other immune and angiogenic markers that may predict sensitivity to this drug&#xD;
      combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First response assessment will be performed at 6 weeks and will include MRI of the brain and&#xD;
      CT body scans (or other clinically indicated body imaging such as MRI or PET CT) to assess&#xD;
      systemic disease. Brain metastasis response will be determined using modified RECIST&#xD;
      (mRECIST) 1.1 criteria, and extracranial disease response will be determined using RECIST&#xD;
      1.1. Responses will be confirmed with repeat imaging done at 12 weeks. Subsequent imaging&#xD;
      will be performed at 12-week intervals thereafter and include an MRI of the brain along with&#xD;
      body imaging, which may include CT, MRI, or PET/CT, as clinically indicated. Patients will&#xD;
      discontinue treatment for disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, patient withdrawal from&#xD;
      the study, termination of study, or death. Patients may be treated beyond progression of&#xD;
      intracranial metastases after consultation with the study PI, provided symptomatic lesions&#xD;
      are treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) or surgery. Dose reduction of pembrolizumab&#xD;
      for immune-related toxicities is not permitted. Dose-reduction of lenvatinib for related&#xD;
      toxicities is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of up to 62 eligible patients will be enrolled (27 patients with melanoma with&#xD;
      allowance for 3 additional patients if any are unevaluable and 29 patients with RCC with&#xD;
      allowance for 3 additional patients if any are unevaluable). Either cohort can be stopped for&#xD;
      futility according to Simon's two-stage design. The study will accrue for approximately 36&#xD;
      months and will be open for approximately 24 additional months as patients on study are&#xD;
      followed.&#xD;

             mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus&#xD;
             Calmette-Guérin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection&#xD;
             are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza&#xD;
             vaccines (eg, FluMist®) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
             Note: Participants who have entered the follow-up phase of an investigational study&#xD;
             may participate as long as it has been 4 weeks after the last dose of the previous&#xD;
             investigational agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy&#xD;
             (in doses exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of&#xD;
