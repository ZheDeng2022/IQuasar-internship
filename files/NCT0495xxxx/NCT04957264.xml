  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preterm infants are at high-risk for the negative implications of both prolonged mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation and extubation failure. Pre-extubation assessments of lung parenchyma and&#xD;
      diaphragmatic function of these infants can be useful adjunctive tool for prediction of&#xD;
      extubation readiness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess the sensitivity and specificity of lung ultrasound and&#xD;
      diaphragmatic function evaluation in prediction of extubation readiness in mechanically&#xD;
      ventilated neonates born at ≤ 32 weeks gestational age.&#xD;

      Study Design and setting:This is a prospective descriptive pilot study that will be conducted&#xD;
      on infants born at ≤ 32 weeks gestation who meet eligibility criteria and are admitted to the&#xD;
      Neonatal intensive care at Mount Sinai Hospital. Enrolment of eligible infants will start&#xD;
      after obtaining approval from Mount Sinai Research Ethics Board and parent's consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time of assessment: Parents of infants on invasive mechanical ventilation who are eligible&#xD;
      for the study will be approached for consent. Once the decision made by attending physician&#xD;
      to extubate the infant, Chest ultrasound (Lung ultrasound + diaphragmatic function&#xD;
      assessment) will be done. Chest ultrasound will be done before next feeding to avoid any&#xD;
      interference of a full stomach on diaphragmatic assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedure: Decisions about extubation will be as per the clinical judgment of the&#xD;
      physician in-charge of the infant and will not in any way based on Chest ultrasound&#xD;
      measurements. A lung ultrasound combined with diaphragmatic function assessment will be done&#xD;
      by one of the investigators prior to extubation. The result of Chest ultrasound will be&#xD;
      masked for the clinical team to avoid any influence of the Chest ultrasound result on the&#xD;
      extubation decision. On the other hand, if the attending physician requests Chest ultrasound&#xD;
      for the purpose of the ongoing clinical management or to help with making extubation decision&#xD;
      then the result of the study will be disclosed to the physician and this infant will be&#xD;
      excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A random sample of 20% of eligible infants will have lung ultrasound and diaphragmatic&#xD;
      function assessment done twice by 2 operators (with various levels of Chest ultrasound&#xD;
      expertise). None of the operator will be aware of the result of Chest ultrasound done by the&#xD;
      other operator for the same patient. Lung ultrasound severity score, diaphragmatic thickness&#xD;
      fraction and diaphragmatic excursion will be calculated. Inter-rater agreement will be&#xD;
      assessed using raw percentage of agreement (Pa), Cohen's and Kappa (κ), and G wet agreement&#xD;
      coefficient (AC1). Intra-class correlation will be determined for variables with continuous&#xD;
      measurements (mixed factorial design). High-resolution linear and curvi-linear ultrasound&#xD;
      probes of 20-5 and 10-3 MegaHertZ will be used to assess lung ultrasound score and to measure&#xD;
      diaphragmatic thickness and diaphragmatic excursion [amplitude] respectively using both&#xD;
      B-mode and M-mode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung ultrasound assessment technique: Chest ultrasound will be performed in a standardized&#xD;
      manner. A longitudinal scan of the anterior and lateral chest walls will be performed. Three&#xD;
      chest areas for each side (upper anterior, lower anterior, and lateral) will be assessed.&#xD;
      Each area will have a score of 0 to 3 points with the total score ranges from 0 to 18 which&#xD;
      inversely correlating with lung aeration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diaphragmatic assessment technique: Diaphragm assessment will be performed in the supine&#xD;
      position. For measuring diaphragmatic excursion, the curvilinear probe will be placed on the&#xD;
      lower intercostal spaces between the mid-clavicular and anterior axillary lines on the right&#xD;
      side and between the anterior and mid-axillary lines for the left side. Using the B mode, the&#xD;
      proper exploration line of the diaphragm will be detected by directing the beam perpendicular&#xD;
      to the posterior third of each hemi-diaphragm. By M mode, the cyclic caudal diaphragmatic&#xD;
      displacement with respiration will be measured as the perpendicular distance between the most&#xD;
      caudal point of the liver or spleen at the end of expiration and the end of inspiration. The&#xD;
      average of three respiratory cycles will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment of the diaphragmatic efficiency as a pressure generator will be evaluated&#xD;
      using the diaphragmatic thickness fraction. Diaphragmatic thickness will be measured at the&#xD;
      apposition zone which can be obtained by placing the linear transducer above the 10th rib in&#xD;
      the mid-axillary or anterior axillary lines in the right intercostal spaces. By B-mode, three&#xD;
      distinct layers will be seen, the diaphragm as a hypo-echoic area bordered by two clear&#xD;
      echogenic lines of the pleural membrane (upper line) and the peritoneal membrane (lower&#xD;
      line). Using M-mode tracing, inspiratory diaphragmatic thickness will be measured as the&#xD;
      maximum perpendicular distance between pleural and peritoneal layers and by the same way&#xD;
      expiratory diaphragmatic thickness will be recorded. diaphragmatic thickness Fraction will be&#xD;
      calculated using the following formula: diaphragmatic thickness Fraction equal to&#xD;
      [(inspiratory thickness _ expiratory thickness)/expiratory thickness] x100. The average of&#xD;
      the calculated diaphragmatic thickness Fraction from three respiratory cycles will be&#xD;
      estimated. All Chest Ultrasound assessments will be undertaken using a standard aseptic&#xD;
      technique.&#xD;
