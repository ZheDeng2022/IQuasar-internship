  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pressurized intraperitoneal aerosol chemotherapy (PIPAC) is a novel drug delivery system that&#xD;
      allows the direct application of chemotherapeutic agents into the peritoneal cavity. It&#xD;
      boosts improved distribution, enhanced tissue uptake and repeatability using minimally&#xD;
      invasive access. It was devised to palliate the local symptoms of extensive peritoneal&#xD;
      metastases (PM) in patients who are not amenable to curative surgery. This study is to&#xD;
      determine safety and feasibility of PIPAC in patients with PM from Gastrointestinal (GI)&#xD;
      cancer, Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary (HPB) cancer, and other rare malignancies.&#xD;
