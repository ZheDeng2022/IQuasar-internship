  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common degenerative disease associated with functional impairments,&#xD;
      activity limitations, participation restrictions, as well as poor quality life. Therefore,&#xD;
      the comprehensive assessment is important to determine how complex problems affect patients&#xD;
      with OA. The first aim of this study was to link and allocate items of The Western Ontario&#xD;
      and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) OA index with ICF Comprehensive Core Set for&#xD;
      osteoarthritis. The second aim was to examine the relationship between the quality of life&#xD;
      and each ICF component's scores determined based on clinical data of WOMAC in OA.&#xD;

    <measure>The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) OA Index:</measure>
    <time_frame>15 min</time_frame>
    <description>The WOMAC Index is a self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire consisting of 24 items which are widely used in the evaluation of hip and knee OA. It consists of 24 items: pain (5 items), stiffness (2 items), and physical function (17 items). High score indicates worse pain, stiffness, and functional limitations.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Nottingham Health Profile (NHP):</measure>
    <time_frame>15 min</time_frame>
    <description>NHP is a widely used measure of perceived distress of patients in physical, emotional and social domains. It consists of 38 items which are physical mobility (8 items), pain (8 items), sleep (5 items), emotional reactions (9 items), social isolation (5 items) and energy level (3 items). Questions have &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; answers. Higher score indicates greater distress</description>
