  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-armed, prospective single-centre clinical study to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of riociguat on right heart size and function in patients with manifest PAH and CTEPH.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Right heart size and function are of utmost prognostic importance in PAH/CTEPH. RV&#xD;
      performance measured by echocardiography (Raymond et al. 2002, Bossone et al. 2013) and&#xD;
      enlarged RA area (Raymond, et al. 2002; Austin et al. 2015) have been shown to be independent&#xD;
      prognostic factors in PAH. Recently, a retrospective single centre study has shown that&#xD;
      riociguat treatment was associated with a significant reduction of RV and RA area after 3, 6&#xD;
      and 12 months compared to baseline (Marra et al. 2015). RA area significantly decreased after&#xD;
      12 months and RV systolic function assessed with tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion&#xD;
      (TAPSE) improved after 6 and 12 months of riociguat therapy (Marra et al. 2015). The results&#xD;
      were confirmed by a recent retrospective multicentre study (Marra et al. 2018). It is&#xD;
      therefore reasonable to assume a beneficial effect of riociguat on right heart size and&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy endpoint in this study is the change in RV and RA area from baseline to&#xD;
      24 weeks. Treatment will be initiated and individually adjusted according to systolic blood&#xD;
      pressure and tolerability. Patients who discontinue medication prematurely will be asked to&#xD;
      continue with study assessments and perform study visits as outlined in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical examinations comprise medical history, physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG),&#xD;
      blood gas analyses, lung function tests, laboratory testing (including NT-proBNP),&#xD;
      echocardiography at rest, and right heart catheterization (RHC) according to clinical&#xD;
      practice of the PH centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prospective period of data collection comprises a 24-week study period a follow-up phase&#xD;
      of about 30Â±7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome (survival and transplant-free survival) of all patients will be assessed when the&#xD;
      last patient has terminated his/her 24-week observation period.&#xD;

    <description>Riociguat (1 mg, 1.5 mg, 2 mg and 2.5 mg three times daily) starting at 1.0 mg three times daily at the beginning of the study. Dosage will be individually up-titrated up to a maximum dosage of 2.5 mg three times daily after 8 weeks. Study medication will be provided orally with or without food.

    <description>Treatment will be initiated and individually adjusted according to systolic blood pressure and tolerability. During the titration phase, each patient will be asked to measure their peripheral systolic blood pressure and the heart rate at home three times per day and document the values in the patient diary. The results will be examined by the investigator during each visit/phone call-visit. Provided that the systolic blood pressure is â¥ 95 mmHg measured at trough before intake of each dose and the patient has no signs or symptoms of hypotension, the dose of study medication will be titrated by +0.5 mg tid every 2 weeks until maximal tolerated dosage (maximal permitted dose: of 2.5 mg tid). After the titration period, blood pressure should be measured upon signs or symptoms of hypotension. Maintenance dose: The established individual dose should be maintained unless signs and symptoms of hypotension occur.</description>

             treatment).*&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. *Pre-treated patients need to be stable on endothelin receptor antagonists or&#xD;
             prostacyclin treatment for at least two weeks prior to Visit 1. &quot;Stable&quot; is defined as&#xD;

             will be made by the clinicians at a regular clinical follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Unspecific treatments which may also be used for the treatment of PH such as oral&#xD;
             anticoagulants, diuretics, digitalis, calcium channel blockers or oxygen&#xD;
