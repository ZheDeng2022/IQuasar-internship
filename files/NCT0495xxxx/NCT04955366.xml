    <textblock>
      This is a single center, randomized, controlled phase 2b, conversion trial. This protocol has&#xD;
      been developed to answer the question: Can patients be safely converted from monthly&#xD;
      belatacept IV infusions to abatacept subcutaneous injections without a decrease in kidney&#xD;
      function.The primary objective will be the difference in estimated GFR (eGFR) for abatacept&#xD;
      and belatacept groups using a monthly repeated measures model between randomization and 12&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

      This is a single center, randomized, controlled phase 2b, conversion trial. This protocol has&#xD;
      been developed to answer the question: Can patients be safely converted from monthly&#xD;
      belatacept IV infusions to abatacept subcutaneous injections without a decrease in kidney&#xD;
      function. Research subjects will be recruited from those who were initiated on belatacept at&#xD;
      the time of their kidney transplant and have been stable on belatacept therapy for at least 2&#xD;
      years post-transplant and off CNI therapy for at least 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 86 subjects will be randomized in equal numbers, 43 patients in each arm.&#xD;
      Enrollment of all 86 patients is expected to be completed within 1.5 years. All patients will&#xD;
      be actively followed in the study for 24 months following randomization. The patient&#xD;
      participation is projected to last a total of 3.5 years with data analysis to follow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective will be the difference in estimated GFR (eGFR) for abatacept and&#xD;
      belatacept groups using a monthly repeated measures model between randomization and 12&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
