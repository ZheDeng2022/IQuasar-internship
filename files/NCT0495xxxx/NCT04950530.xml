  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate changes in insulin sensitivity, lipid metabolism and endocrine&#xD;
      profile in HIV-negative subjects exposed to Biktarvy (B/F/TAF) compared to subject not&#xD;
      exposed to B/F/TAF for 28 days.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomised, crossover study investigating the difference in changes in insulin sensitivity&#xD;
      (determined by peripheral glucose uptake using a euglycaemic clamp) with the administration&#xD;
      of Biktarvy (B/F/TAF) compared to no B/F/TAF for 28 days in HIV seronegative healthy&#xD;
      volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      B/F/TAF tablet once daily for the first 28 days of the study. No treatment for the last 44&#xD;
      days of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      No treatment for the first 28 days of the study. B/F/TAF tablet once daily for the last 28&#xD;
      days of the study (day 44-72).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research bloods, endocrine profiles, weight and urine samples will be collected at baseline,&#xD;
      as well as day 28, 44, and 72 to enable comparative analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be closely monitored whilst taking the study medications. Participants will&#xD;
      exit the study 72 days post-randomisation, with a follow-up call 28 days after exiting.&#xD;
