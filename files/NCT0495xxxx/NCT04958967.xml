  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 multi-center clinical study. To explore the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      Furmonertinib Mesilate at different doses in locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC patients&#xD;
      with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study plans to enroll 20subjects, including 20 treated patients aThe subjects will&#xD;
      receive Furmonertinib Mesilate 240 mg/day or 160mg/day until disease progression, death or&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>ORR, objective response rate</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>IRC assessed objective response rate (ORR) using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 in participants with epidermal growth factor receptor EGFRmutations. These outcome is based on the visual assessment of tumor size in morphological images provided by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging.ORR is defined as the percentage of participants achieving complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) per RECIST version 1.1. CR: Disappearance of all extranodal target lesions; PR: At least a 30% decrease in Sum of the Longest Diameters (SLD) of target lesions, taking as a reference the baseline SLD.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response (DOR)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of response is defined as the time interval from the time that the measurement criteria are first met for CR/PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that PD is objectively documented.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease Control Rate (DCR)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>DCR is defined as the percentage of participants who have achieved CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) (in the case of SD, measurements must have met the SD criteria at least once after study entry at a minimum interval of 42 days) after the initiation of study drug.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time interval from the date of randomization until the first date at which the criteria for progressive disease (PD) according to RECIST version 1.1 are met or death, whichever occurs first.</description>
