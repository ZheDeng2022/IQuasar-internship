  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sema, which means &quot;to listen/hear&quot; in lexical meaning, is a special physical activity&#xD;
      performed in the form of rotating in different positions rhythmically with music.During the&#xD;
      sema activity, although it is similar to dance therapy due to the cyclical movements it&#xD;
      contains, it can also be evaluated as a physical activity. With Sema music therapy&#xD;
      accompanied by musical melodies, it is similar to meditation, as the ties with the world are&#xD;
      cut off and the attempt is made to reach divine love. Various studies have shown that&#xD;
      physical activity, music therapy, dance therapy, and meditation have positive effects on&#xD;
      depression and anxiety in the literature. However, there is no scientific study in the&#xD;
      literature investigating the effects of Sema activity, which includes all these approaches,&#xD;
      on depression, anxiety and physical activity. In order to support the literature in this&#xD;
      sense, this study was planned to examine the effects of Sema activity on physical activity&#xD;
      level, depression and anxiety. Individuals between the ages of 18-60 who are registered in&#xD;
      Konya Mevlana Cultural Center who have been doing Sema for at least 1 year will be included&#xD;
      in the study. Participants who agree to participate in the study will be asked to fill in the&#xD;
      online Informed Volunteer Form, Demographic Information Form, Beck Anxiete Scale, Beck&#xD;
      Depression Scale and International Physical Activity Scale - Short Form. The data will be&#xD;
      analyzed statistically with SPSS version 23.0.&#xD;
