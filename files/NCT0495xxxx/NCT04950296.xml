  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several probiotic strains have shown beneficial outcomes in IBS patients, particularly among&#xD;
      the Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium genera, Lactobacillus plantarum (recently reclassified&#xD;
      as Lactiplantibacillus plantarum) is a frequently isolated species of the healthy human GI&#xD;
      tract that has been studied in numerous GI clinical studies, including for IBS.In the present&#xD;
      study, the efficacy and tolerability of L. plantarum (UALp-05TM), will be evaluated in&#xD;
      individuals with IBS-D.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several strains of Lactobacillus genus have previously been assessed in patients with IBS in&#xD;
      multiple randomized controlled trials, demonstrating the efficacy of these strains in&#xD;
      reducing IBS-related symptoms such as abdominal pain, distension and flatulence. We&#xD;
      hypothesize the L. plantarum UALp-05 strain to benefit research participants by reducing pain&#xD;
      severity, normalizing diarrhea predominant stool type and subsequently improving quality of&#xD;
      life (QOL) standards. The current study with L. plantarum UALp-05, will include a lower dose&#xD;
      of 1 billion CFU/day (considered a low dose among probiotic IBS studies) and a higher dose of&#xD;
      10 billion CFU/ day (considered a mid-point dose among probiotic IBS studies) for a period of&#xD;
      8-weeks.Each probiotic dosage group will be assessed individually in comparison to placebo.&#xD;
