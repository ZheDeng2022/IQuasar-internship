      A randomized controlled trial: Conservative treatments including physiotherapy and&#xD;
      rehabilitation in the management of rotator cuff-related shoulder pain (RCRSP) are generally&#xD;
      accepted as the first-line treatment approach, however, it is known that the disease-specific&#xD;
      physiotherapy methods used by physiotherapists are highly variable. This may be caused by the&#xD;
      insufficient knowledge of therapists about evidence-based interventions to RCRSP. The aim of&#xD;
      this study is to develop the '' Rotator Cuff Related Shoulder Pain E-learning Program'' and&#xD;
      evaluate its effect on students' knowledge and clinical reasoning skills related to&#xD;
      evidence-based RCRSP interventions and their levels of confidence to have this knowledge&#xD;
      compared with a control group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Shoulder pain is one of society's most common musculoskeletal problems, with a prevalence&#xD;
      defined between 16-26%. Almost 70% of shoulder pain complaints are caused by pathologies&#xD;
      associated with the rotator cuff. Conservative treatments including physiotherapy are widely&#xD;
      accepted as a first-line treatment approach in the management of shoulder pain and on the&#xD;
      other hand, the variety of physiotherapy practice is conspicuous. Despite the majority of&#xD;
      physiotherapists provide treatment in line with current evidence, passive modalities are&#xD;
      still highly preferred by some physiotherapists. The gap between research evidence and&#xD;
      practice could be slightly due to the lack of an up-to-date undergraduate physiotherapy&#xD;
      curriculum about the RCRSP. Therefore, the aim of this study is to develop the '' Rotator&#xD;
      Cuff Related Shoulder Pain E-learning Program'' and evaluate its effect on students'&#xD;
      knowledge and clinical reasoning skills related to evidence-based RCRSP interventions and&#xD;
      their levels of confidence to have this knowledge compared with a control group. A randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial including 146 4th grade physiotherapy students will be conducted. Students&#xD;
      will be randomized into an e-learning group (n=73) or wait-list control group (n=73). The&#xD;
      primary outcome will be the RCRSP achievement test, and the secondary outcome will be the&#xD;
      self-reported confidence in knowledge and clinical reasoning skills related to RCRSP. All&#xD;
      data will be collected through an online survey, which will be applied in two different time&#xD;
      periods: pre-intervention and post-intervention. All groups will first answer the&#xD;
      questionnaire at the beginning (week 0) and after the study group's e-learning activity (4-5&#xD;
      weeks).&#xD;
