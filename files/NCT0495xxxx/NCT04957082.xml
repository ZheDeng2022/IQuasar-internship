    <textblock>
      This disparities-focused study seeks to evaluate communication strategies for better&#xD;
      encouraging understanding and uptake of salivary SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing among African&#xD;
      Americans residing in Flint, Michigan. This iteration will consider individuals recruited&#xD;
      from the Flint Registry and assess willingness to participate in a drive-up saliva sample&#xD;
      collection taking place at a central location in Flint, Michigan.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      African Americans develop and die from SARS-CoV-2 infection more than any other racial group&#xD;
      in the United States, including in majority African American cities such as Flint, Michigan.&#xD;
      Addressing these disparities may be aided by SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing. However, African&#xD;
      Americans may be reluctant to partake in conventional antibody testing programs due to&#xD;
      medical mistrust and experiences with racism. This study seeks to evaluate communication&#xD;
      strategies for better encouraging understanding and uptake of salivary SARS-CoV-2 antibody&#xD;
      testing. The central hypothesis is that African-Americans will be more receptive to antibody&#xD;
      testing when benefits and limitations are communicated in a culturally effective manner. Our&#xD;
      clinical trial aims are to 1) develop and compare effects of a general versus&#xD;
      culturally-targeted video about antibody testing on African American and White Flint&#xD;
      residents' antibody testing attitudes and uptake; 2) identify and compare effects of a&#xD;
      general versus culturally-targeted video on activation of medical mistrust and racism-related&#xD;
      cognition among African Americans when considering antibody testing. In collaboration with&#xD;
      clinical and community partners, we have prepared and will evaluate general and&#xD;
      culturally-targeted video tutorials about SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing. These brief videos&#xD;
      will be distributed to the Flint community through the Flint Registry - a highly visible&#xD;
      local health resource exchange. We will furnish an opportunity to engage salivary antibody&#xD;
      screening and measure willingness to participate. In this study iteration, we will consider&#xD;
      willingness to participate in a drive-up saliva sample collection that is taking place at a&#xD;
      central location in Flint, Michigan.&#xD;

    <description>Self-report measures of antibody testing attitudes, norms, perceived control, intentions to be screened are each adapted from published research (Lucas et al., 2021). These items are constructed following recommended procedures to ensure construct validity and adequate behavioral specificity (Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 2011). All items use Likert-type scales that range from 1 (strongly agree) to 7 (strongly disagree).</description>

    <measure>Anticipatory Racism</measure>
    <time_frame>collected immediately, up to 1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>Adapted from published research (Lucas et al., 2021), all participants respond to questions that asked whether they believe racism would impact the benefits they could experience from obtaining antibody testing. Participants will then respond to three questions that ask, &quot;In some way, my obtaining CRC screening would be impacted by racism,&quot; &quot;Racism would undermine the value of CRC screening for me.&quot; and &quot;Racism would negatively impact the accuracy of my CRC screening. Responses are collected using a 7-point Likert-type scale that ranged from 1 (strongly agree) to 7 (strongly disagree).</description>
