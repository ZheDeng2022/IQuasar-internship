      A modular, first time in human, open label, multiple dose, accelerated escalation with cohort&#xD;
      expansion study of the safety and pharmacokinetics of intravenous infusion of CP-506, a tumor&#xD;
      agnostic Hypoxia Activated Prodrug in patients with HRD/FAD solid tumours or tumor types with&#xD;
      high incidence of HRD/FAD in monotherapy or in combination with carboplatin or patients with&#xD;
      solid tumour and oligoprogressive disease receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI): a&#xD;
      phase I-IIa clinical trial&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a First in Human, early phase (I/IIa), 3 modules, 2 parts (A- dose escalation&#xD;
      and B- cohort expansion), open-label, uncontrolled, multi-center, multiple dose, accelerated&#xD;
      3+3 dose escalation study. The study consist of 3 study modules. Module 1 is monotherapy with&#xD;
      accelerated dose escalation. Modules 2 and 3 are also accelerated dose escalation modules,&#xD;
      but with a combination of CP-506 with either Carboplatin or ICI. Initiation of modules 2 and&#xD;
      3 are dependent on the decision by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) based on&#xD;
      the safety, tolerability and feasibility information from the study as a whole.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study modules will consist of a Part A (dose finding) and an optional Part B (cohort&#xD;
      expansion). The option to start Part B will be decided by the IDMC based on safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and feasibility information from the study as a whole. The expansion cohorts&#xD;
      will explore preliminary efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modules 2 and 3 will start after the definition of the &quot;minimal biological effective dose&quot;&#xD;
      (MBED) as the dose that results in 1) a decrease of 20% of hypoxia radiomics score on&#xD;
      sequential CT of at least one lesion OR 2) a decrease of 20% of the initial tumour volume of&#xD;
      at least one lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MBED is assessed by CT scan at visit 7, 12 and 13. After observation of an MBED in three&#xD;
      patients, the data supporting the MBED assessment will be reviewed by the IDMC for&#xD;
      confirmation. Based on this evaluation together with the collected safety data, the IDMC will&#xD;
      propose the start of modules 2 and 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A maximum of 126 patients with advanced or metastatic cancer will be recruited in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Module 1 - Monotherapy: up to 24 patients for Part A and 10 patients for Part B for whom&#xD;
           no standard of care or known effective treatment options are available and with cancers&#xD;
           that show a considerable incidence of Homologous Recombination or Fanconi Anaemia DNA&#xD;
           repair defects (HRD/FAD)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Module 2 - Combination with Carboplatin: up to 24 patients for Part A and 22 patients&#xD;
           for Part B with cancer types enriched for Homologous Recombination or Fanconi Anaemia&#xD;
           DNA repair defects (HRD/FAD), for whom no standard of care or known effective treatment&#xD;
           options are available.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Module 3 - Combination with ICI: up to 24 patients for Part A and 22 patients for Part B&#xD;
           with advanced or metastatic cancer for whom standard of care immune checkpoint inhibitor&#xD;
           (ICI) are currently administered for at least 6 months, would still be administered&#xD;
           according to the treating clinician, outside any clinical trial but resulted in&#xD;
           oligoprogression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each treatment cycle consists of three consecutive days of IP infusion for two hours, one day&#xD;
      for observation and blood sampling, and a recovery time of 3 weeks. Patients are expected to&#xD;
      come to the hospital for 18 visits. They consist of 1 screening visit, 3 cycles of CP-506&#xD;
      treatment. Each cycle will be followed by a post cycle visit after 14 and 21 days. The follow&#xD;
      up visit will take place at day 105.&#xD;

             chronic liver disease (including Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones) or&#xD;
             hepatobiliary involvement of malignancy is acceptable if participant otherwise meets&#xD;
             entry criteria&#xD;
