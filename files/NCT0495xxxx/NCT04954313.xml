    <textblock>
      Purpose: The Baseline Oral Health Health Study is a randomized controlled trial to evaluate&#xD;
      the impact of regular, professional non-surgical Intensive Periodontal Therapy (scaling and&#xD;
      root planing and optimal oral hygiene with associated professional oral health behavior&#xD;
      advice ), on oral health as well as whether such effects are associated with corresponding&#xD;
      changes to biomarkers characterizing systemic health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: The Baseline Oral Health Study will enroll approximately 200 participants in&#xD;
      the study with approximately 100 participants each within the Control Group and the Treatment&#xD;
      Group. The study population will be recruited from the Project Baseline Health Study&#xD;
      participants in the North Carolina region and may be expanded to include subjects recruited&#xD;
      from University of North Carolina (UNC) if the initial screening from Project Baseline Health&#xD;
      Study pool of participants in the North Carolina region does not fulfill study enrollment&#xD;
      powering.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures (methods): The study population will be recruited from Project Baseline Health&#xD;
      Study participants. The Project Baseline Health Study is a longitudinal cohort study which&#xD;
      characterizes participants across clinical, molecular, imaging, sensor, self-reported,&#xD;
      behavioral, psychological, environmental, or other health-related measurements from onsite&#xD;
      and/or remote visits, continuous monitoring through sensor technology, and regular engagement&#xD;
      via an online portal, and mobile app. The study population will be recruited from Project&#xD;
      Baseline Health Study participants diagnosed with cardiovascular disease and/or type 2&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus (including prediabetes) and eligible for periodontal intervention. The&#xD;
      study will use dental centers and an experienced dental team to manage the oral care provided&#xD;
      in this study.&#xD;

    <masking_description>The investigator and all sub-investigators will make every effort to remain blinded as to the subject regimen. Periodontal treatment throughout the Study will be provided only by experienced general dentists, periodontists or dental hygienists who are licensed, trained and calibrated prior to the start of the study. In order to maintain examiner blinding throughout the study, the treatment provider will be a person other than the dental examiner and will exclusively provide treatment and not participate in patient assessments.</masking_description>

    <description>The impact of treatment on oral health measures, will be performed using generalized estimating equations (GEE) methods. Longitudinal outcomes in the Treated vs. Control groups will be compared and will include all subjects who were randomized and their data from visits T1 - T4 based on intent-to-treat (ITT) group assignment.

    <measure>Impact of treatment on emotional wellbeing</measure>
    <time_frame>Comparing baseline (day 0) and T4 (day 360)</time_frame>
    <description>Emotional wellbeing will be evaluated through the use of PANAS (Positive Affect and Negative Affect Scales). PANAS consists of 10 positive and 10 negative valence word items. Items are rated by the participant to indicate their assessment of how they are feeling about this item &quot;right now&quot; on a scale of 1(slightly) or not at all through 5 (extremely). 10 of of the items form a positive affect subscale, in which a higher score indicates increased positive affect, with a subscale range of 10 to 50. 10 of the items form a negative affect subscale, in which a higher score indicates more negative affect, with a subscale range of 10 to 50. This outcome measure is change in the 10 item positive affect subscale.</description>

    <measure>Impact of treatment on gingival index</measure>
    <time_frame>Comparing baseline (day 0) and T4 (day 360)</time_frame>
    <description>The gingival index will be scored on three facial surfaces (distofacial, facial, mesiofacial) and three lingual surfaces (distolingual, lingual, mesiolingual). Areas are examined by placing the periodontal probe under the gingival margin at approximately 1mm deep and sweeping the probe from the distal surface to the mesial surface in quadrants I and IV and mesial to the distal surface in quadrants II and III. After each quadrant is swept, calls are made based on gingival inflammation and the presence or absence of bleeding according to criteria which range from 0 to 3. Loe and Silness Gingival Index (GI); scale: 0 = normal gingiva, 1 = mild inflammation, 2 = moderate inflammation, 3 = severe inflammation</description>

Plaque scores shall be visually assessed at 6 sites per tooth (distobuccal, buccal, mesiobuccal and distolingual, lingual, mesiolingual surfaces) on a scale of 0-3. Scores are the following: 0 =No debris or stain present on the clinical crown; 1 =Soft debris covering not more than 1/3 of the clinical crown (cervical 3rd), or presence of extrinsic stains without other debris regardless of surface area covered; 2 =Soft debris covering more than 1/3, but not more than 2/3 (middle 3rd) of the clinical crown; 3 =Soft debris covering more than 2/3 of the clinical crown</description>

    <description>Percent change of flow mediated dilation. Ultrasound images of the right brachial artery and Doppler measures of arterial flow will be acquired before and after reactive hyperemia is induced by inflating a pneumatic occlusion cuff placed around the lower arm. FMD will be calculated as the percent change in arterial diameter from baseline. Peak hyperemic flow will be expressed as the time-velocity integral of the Doppler velocity .</description>

All subjects will also complete a set of questionnaires (PANAS &amp; PMT) using an online form. A subset of 50 subjects from each group will be randomly selected to have oral images captured using an intra-oral scanner at Baseline and a subset of follow-up visits. Additionally, subjects in the Treatment Group will also receive brief behavioral advice from dental professionals focusing mainly on motivation and acknowledgement.</description>
