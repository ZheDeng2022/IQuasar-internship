    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare the effect of high-intensity interval training and&#xD;
      intermittent fasting on improving body weight and functional capacity among overweight&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exercise improves cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle strength, endurance, body composition,&#xD;
      and decreases visceral fat. The, increase in physical activity and modification of eating&#xD;
      behaviors are the first line of interventions given because of their low costs and low risks&#xD;
      of complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most commonly, the continuous exercise of moderate intensity, that has to be performed&#xD;
      several days of the week to get target benefits have been used, on the other hand, different&#xD;
      forms of training which aim to reduce time spent exercising by increasing exercise intensity&#xD;
      have been considered as an alternative to increasing adherence to the training program which&#xD;
      is supported by some researches that may have greater benefits as high intensity interval&#xD;
      training improves the vascular function of the muscle capillary density and endothelial&#xD;
      nitric oxide synthase(eNOS) levels. But there are some overweight people even some of the&#xD;
      young people have restriction to perform exercise programs due to any medical problem that&#xD;
      could interfere with exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So, searching for optimal dietary interventions for obesity is still ongoing, but the&#xD;
      modification in eating behaviors are hampered by difficulties in coping with a different&#xD;
      diet. So, the diet with a fasting component that will be used in this study may be more&#xD;
      effective than other complex and restrictive diets as it essentially limits the caloric&#xD;
      intake to a specified period without major diet composition changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So, the aim of this study is to compare the effect of high-intensity interval training and&#xD;
      intermittent fasting on improving body weight and functional capacity among overweight&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;

    <description>Assessment via using Standard Bruce protocol will be used to measure (VO2) max. The Bruce protocol for multi stage treadmill testing of maximal exercise will be used. This will begin with stage 1 with walking slowly for three minutes at 2.7 Km/hr at a 10% grade (inclination), speed and grade then increased in every stage of 3 minutes and end at stage 7 or till exhaustion.</description>

Training phase for 30 min divided into four sets of 4-min length each at intensity equals 80-90% of HRmax interspersed by 3 minutes low intensity walking at the level of 65-75% of HRmax.&#xD;
Cooling down period for 5 min of at 50-60% of the HRmax. All subjects will be trained at the lower intensity limit for the first 2 weeks of the program before increasing the intensity levels toward the upper limit.</description>

    <description>Every subject will be instructed to fast a fixed 16 hours followed by 8 hours of eating every day through the whole study period based on their life and sleeping style. During fasting, zero-calorie coffee, tea and water intake will be permitted. Beverages containing calories were consumed during the feeding hours each day. All subjects will be instructed about their optimum caloric requirement based on their basal metabolic rate that will be calculated in advance to avoid over consumption of food on severe caloric restriction as we like to investigate the effect of this way of fasting on reducing weight and improving functional capacity.</description>
