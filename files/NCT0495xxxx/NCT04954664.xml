      This study will compare two techniques to achieve increase in ridge dimensions as a&#xD;
      preparation for dental implants using a resorbable barrier membrane and bone particulate&#xD;
      allogenic graft hydrated with saline or a growth factor called Recombinant Human&#xD;
      Platelet-Derived Growth Factor (rhPDGF).&#xD;

      This is a prospective, randomized, and examiner-only-masked study. It is designed to&#xD;
      clinically compare the use of bone particulate allograft hydrated with rhPDGF vs bone&#xD;
      particulate allograft hydrated with saline, for patients who were planned to receive dental&#xD;
      implants but presented with deficient bone ridges. This investigation of two techniques to&#xD;
      achieve increase in ridge dimensions as a preparation for dental implants using a resorbable&#xD;
      barrier membrane and bone particulate allogenic graft hydrated with saline or a growth factor&#xD;
      called Recombinant Human Platelet-Derived Growth Factor (rhPDGF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In two arms, bone core biopsies will be harvested at time of implant placement 4 months&#xD;
      following ridge augmentation grafting. These 2x8mm bone cores will then undergo histological&#xD;
      and histomorphometrical analyses to determine qualitative and quantitative healing&#xD;
      differences between in both study arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical measurements are gathered at 2 time points (grating and implant placement) at all&#xD;
      defects and will be compared for differences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) initial scans are conducted immediately following prior&#xD;
      to ridge augmentation and second scans obtained prior to implant placement both arms. These&#xD;
      types of Cone Beam CT scans as well as conventional dental x-rays are valuable treatment&#xD;
      planning tools that are commonly used in modern-day implant dentistry. The scans and the&#xD;
      x-ray images are also used to monitor the health of tissues surrounding implants and to make&#xD;
      sure that the implant remains securely implanted into the jawbone over time.&#xD;

    <description>To quantify the distribution of the different tissues (new bone, soft tissue, residual graft and artifact) after 4 months of healing.

    <time_frame>From baseline to 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>quantification of bone width gain after ridge augmentation. both clinically using a caliper to measure the ridge width before and after ridge augmentation and also radiographically using a software that superimpose before and after CBCT to calculate the difference which basically leads to amount of bone gain.</description>
