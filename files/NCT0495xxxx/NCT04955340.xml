  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Resminostat is a potent, orally available inhibitor of Class I, IIb and IV histone&#xD;
      deacetylases (HDACs), including a pronounced activity against HDAC6. Resminostat targets&#xD;
      epigenetic changes observed in tumour cells and has the potential to provide significant&#xD;
      benefit to patients with advanced malignancies by inhibiting tumour progression and&#xD;
      metastasis or even inducing tumour regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a Phase 1, open-label, non-randomized, single dose study of the absorption,&#xD;
      metabolism, excretion of [14C] resminostat following a single oral dose in healthy male&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine the absorption, metabolism, and excretion (AME) of&#xD;
      [14C] resminostat and to characterize and determine the metabolites present in plasma, urine,&#xD;
      and, where possible, faeces in healthy male participants following a single oral&#xD;
      administration. Knowledge of the metabolism and excretion of parent drug and its metabolites&#xD;
      is useful for evaluating the Metabolites in Safety Testing requirements elucidated in the&#xD;
      International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) M3, and the likelihood of effects of renal or&#xD;
      hepatic impairment on the disposition of resminostat, and the likelihood for drug-drug&#xD;
      interactions with resminostat. The results from this study may guide future study designs&#xD;
      using special populations or evaluating the potential for drug-drug interactions.&#xD;
