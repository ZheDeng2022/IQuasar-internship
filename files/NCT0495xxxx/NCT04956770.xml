    <textblock>
      The purpose of the STIMO-PARKINSON study is to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy&#xD;
      of Targeted Epidural Spinal Stimulation (TESS) system to induce modulation in leg muscle&#xD;
      recruitment in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, and its capacity to improve key&#xD;
      gait and balance deficits when employed in the context of a rehabilitation process of 3 to 5&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

      The study intervention consists of 5 phases preceded by pre-screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  enrolment and eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  main phase of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  end of study phase&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline, general information and Parkinson related medical history are collected.&#xD;
      Clinical evaluations are also completed without and with current therapy, (i.e. NO(MED+DBS),&#xD;
      and MED+DBS conditions). Finally, quality of life questionnaires are collected for the&#xD;
      patient as well as expectations questionnaires for the physiotherapists involved in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main phase of the study consists of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stimulation configuration sessions during which TESS protocols will be setup and&#xD;
           optimized. This procedure aims to configure the spatial and temporal parameters of TESS&#xD;
           that will recruit specific muscle groups. Specific TESS protocols will be configured for&#xD;
           various motor tasks which will be used during the rehabilitation phase and clinical&#xD;
           evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TESS-supported rehabilitation sessions during which patients will undergo an in-clinic&#xD;
           rehabilitation training regime supported by TESS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre- and post- rehabilitation evaluation sessions during which four clinical evaluation&#xD;
           sessions will take place focusing on assessment of locomotion, balance and PD related&#xD;
           deficits. The tests will be done when patients are:&#xD;
&#xD;
           (i) in NO(MED+DBS) condition (without any therapy, i.e. without medication and DBS OFF)&#xD;
           (ii) in MED+DBS condition (the patient's standard therapeutical condition, i.e. usual&#xD;
           medication dose and DBS ON) (iii) in TESS+MED condition (usual medication dose, TESS ON,&#xD;
           DBS OFF) (iv) in TESS+MED+DBS condition (usual medication dose, TESS ON, DBS ON)&#xD;
&#xD;
      One year after patient enrolment, the patient will come for follow up visits where he will&#xD;
      again perform an evaluation session for each therapy condition as described above, to&#xD;
      evaluate the long-term evolution.&#xD;
