      Postoperative respiratory complications according to the type of drug (sugammadex,&#xD;
      pyridostigmine) used for reversible neuromuscular block when extubating an endotracheal tube&#xD;
      in the operating room after minimally invasive cardiac surgery, and the length of intensive&#xD;
      care unit stay are going to be checked. Through these results, it will be investigated&#xD;
      whether the use of rocuronium-sugarmadex for neuromuscular block and reversal in patients&#xD;
      undergoing minimally invasive cardiac surgery is clinically useful.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The enhanced recovery after surgery program (ERAS program) has been introduced across several&#xD;
      surgical fields, and its benefits are well known, mainly in perioperative colorectal surgery,&#xD;
      pancreatic surgery, urology and gynecology surgery. On the other hand, although there are&#xD;
      suggestions for an early recovery program after surgery in the field of cardiac surgery, it&#xD;
      is still in its infancy. Minimally invasive cardiac surgery has advantages over open thoracic&#xD;
      surgery, such as faster recovery, less bleeding and transfusion, and a reduction in the&#xD;
      frequency of arrhythmias, making it suitable for applying an early recovery program after&#xD;
      surgery. For an early recovery program after surgery, a multidisciplinary approach is&#xD;
      required throughout the surgery period, and among them, early endotracheal extubation, which&#xD;
      has been emphasized before, is known to reduce hospital stay and mortality. In addition, such&#xD;
      early endotracheal extubation includes extubation of the endotracheal tube in the operating&#xD;
      room immediately after completion of surgery as well as within 6 hours of entering the&#xD;
      intensive care unit after the end of surgery. For the reversibility of neuromuscular block,&#xD;
      neostigmine, pyridostigmine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, or sugammadex, a selective&#xD;
      neuromuscular blocker binding agent, are mainly used. It is known to reduce the incidence of&#xD;
      pulmonary complications. However, there is no study on the frequency of postoperative&#xD;
      respiratory complications following neuromuscular block and reversibility using the&#xD;
      Rocuronium-Sugarmadex combination in minimally invasive cardiac surgery.&#xD;
