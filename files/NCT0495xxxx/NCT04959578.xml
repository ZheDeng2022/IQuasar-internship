      The present study was designed to determine whether or not darbepoetin alfa is non-inferior&#xD;
      to recombinant human erythropoietin in the treatment of anemia in children with chronic&#xD;
      kidney disease stage 3-5 (on or not on dialysis).&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To demonstrate that Darbepoetin alpha is non-inferior to erythropoietin for the treatment of&#xD;
      anemia in subjects with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3-5 (on or not on dialysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the safety and tolerability of Darbepoetin alpha in the treatment of anemia in&#xD;
      the pediatric population with CKD stage 3-5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An open-label, randomized, non-inferiority study of darbepoetin alpha (DA) and recombinant&#xD;
      human erythropoietin(rHuEpo) for the treatment of anemia in children with chronic kidney&#xD;
      disease stages 3 to 5 (on or not on dialysis)&#xD;
&#xD;
      DURATION OF STUDY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was conducted over a period of 1 year (from 1st February 2018 to 31st January&#xD;
      2019).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY SETTING:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was conducted in the Division of Pediatric Nephrology, Department of Paediatrics,&#xD;
      Institute of Child Health, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, New Delhi, India.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONSENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prior written informed consent was obtained from parents/ legal guardians of eligible&#xD;
      children for participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the non-inferiority of darbepoetin alfa&#xD;
      compared with rHuEpo. Using a previous study with similar protocol [1], considering&#xD;
      darbepoetin alfa and rHuEpo as equipotent, we accepted a type I error of 0.05 and a type II&#xD;
      error of 0.80 for detecting a true difference. A 1.0 or greater difference in mean change in&#xD;
      Hb variable between two groups was considered clinically significant. An estimate of standard&#xD;
      deviation in dependent variables was assumed as 1.5. As a result, we have calculated that&#xD;
      minimum of 28 patients are needed in each group (total-56) in order to obtain 5% type 1 error&#xD;
      and a 80% power of detecting a difference of 1.0 or more. However, due to time constraints a&#xD;
      sample of minimum 15 subjects in each group was planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note: Sample size estimation was done by powerandsamplesize.com.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was conducted in the following phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screening Phase (Visit 1, Day -14 to Day -1) The potential subjects were screened as per&#xD;
           the inclusion and exclusion criteria only after obtaining written informed consent from&#xD;
           the parent/subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Enrollment and Randomization Phase (Visit 2, Day 0)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subjects were randomized in two groups in a 1:1 ratio by computer generated mechanism&#xD;
           (graphpad.com) as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Treatment arm 1: Erythropoietin&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Treatment arm 2: Darbepoetin alfa&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Treatment Phase (Visit 3, Day 1 to Visit 8, Day 168) Patients received respective&#xD;
           treatments for 24 week period and they were followed up every 4 weeks. Both rHuEpo and&#xD;
           darbepoetin alfa were titrated over the first 23 weeks of the study to maintain the&#xD;
           subjects' Hb levels between 11 to 12 g/dl without adjusting the dosing frequency. Route&#xD;
           of administration was subcutaneous. Efficacy was determined between weeks 24 and 28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICS APPROVAL The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of Sir Ganga Ram&#xD;
      Hospital, New Delhi.&#xD;
