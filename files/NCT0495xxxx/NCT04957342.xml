  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When harvesting autogenous free grafts to treat periodontal conditions (e.g., lack of&#xD;
      attached keratinized tissue, ridge defects, and other mucogingival deformities), the hard&#xD;
      palate is the preferred donor site. The primary disadvantage of this technique is the&#xD;
      creation of a second surgical site. This sacrificial traumatic lesion on the palate is&#xD;
      associated with significant post-operative morbidities, including patient discomfort,&#xD;
      infection, inflammation, hemorrhage, and necrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pilot, blinded Randomized Control Trial will be conducted with subjects who are treatment&#xD;
      planned to receive free gingival graft palatal harvest surgery. The palatal wound donor site&#xD;
      for treatment group 1 will not receive an allograft membrane; while the donor site for&#xD;
      treatment group 2 will receive an amnion-chorion allograft membrane (BioXclude) secured with&#xD;
      a suture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The severity of pain at the palatal wound site will be assessed using an at home survey&#xD;
      (Visual Analog Scale, Pain Catastrophizing Scale, &amp; Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement&#xD;
      Information System Scale). The healing of the palatal donor site will be evaluated&#xD;
      quantitatively and qualitatively (PVS impression and optical scan).&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The primary purpose of this study is to determine patient-reported outcome measures (i.e., pain and satisfaction) during the immediate post-operative period. Participants will be randomly allocated into two study groups (see Study Design for the randomization process). The palatal wound treatment group #1 will not receive an allograft dressing. The palatal wound treatment group #2 will receive a thin bandage (BioXclude, Snoasis Medical) underneath the suture. At the time of the procedure and post-op days 14 and 60, a research team member will administer the survey, take an impression, photograph the surgical site, and collect extra measurements, probing depth (PD), recession (REC), &amp; clinical attachment level (CAL), of the participants' mouth. The subject will also be asked to remotely complete a brief survey twice per day for eight days after surgery.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Single (Participant)</masking>
    <masking_description>Ten subjects (10) requiring mucogingival surgery and palatal graft harvest will be recruited into study.&#xD;
The randomization will be achieved by preparing 10 envelopes, 5 envelopes containing materials for the palatal wound treatment #1 (empty packaging materials) and 5 envelopes containing materials for palatal wound treatment #2 (BioXclude membrane &amp; suture). A blinded study team member will randomly hand the designated cohort allocation materials to the periodontology resident preforming the palatal wound dressing treatment.</masking_description>

    <description>The primary purpose of this study is to determine patient-reported outcome measures (i.e., pain) during the immediate post-operative period (i.e., 60 days). The Visual Analogue Scale survey will be completed by the patients during clinical visits and remotely.&#xD;
The scale ranges from a score of 0 to 10, with a higher score corresponding to more severe pain experienced post-op.</description>

    <description>At the time of the procedure and post-op days 14 and 60, a research team member will administer the survey, take an impression, photograph the surgical site, and collect extra measurements, probing depth (PD), recession (REC), &amp; clinical attachment level (CAL), of the participants' mouth. These records will combined to report volumetric changes of donor site in mm^3.</description>

    <description>The secondary purpose of this study is to determine patient-reported outcome measures (i.e., medication usage) during the immediate post-operative period (i.e., 60 days). The survey will be completed during clinical visits and remotely. The survey will ask the following: &quot;Did you take any medications for pain management of the palatal wound site? What medications &amp; how much?&quot;</description>

    <measure>Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>60 days</time_frame>
    <description>In order to address the subject nature of pain, subjects will be administered the Pain Catastrophizing Scale in the survey (completed during clinical visits and remotely). Each answer choice will be assigned a number, with a higher number reflecting a higher degree of pain experience (&quot;Not at all&quot; is 0; &quot;All the time&quot; is 4). A total score will be calculated as the sum of all answer choices. Total score ranges from 0 to 52, with a higher score corresponding to higher frequency of feelings and thoughts related to pain.</description>

Each answer choice will be assigned a number, with a higher number reflecting a higher degree of pain interference (&quot;Not at all&quot; is 0; &quot;Very much&quot; is 4). A total score will be calculated as the sum of all answer choices. Total score ranges from 0 to 32, with a higher score corresponding to a higher degree of pain interference.</description>
