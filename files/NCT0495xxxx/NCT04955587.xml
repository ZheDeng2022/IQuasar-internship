  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate if there are common biopsychosocial vulnerability&#xD;
      factors for developing and maintaining fatigue, regardless of the diagnosis. The&#xD;
      investigators also believe that subgroups differ in terms of these factors. Participating&#xD;
      patients with ME/CFS, burnout syndrome and post-covid fatigue complete a web form at&#xD;
      inclusion and after 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. There is no upper limit for the number&#xD;
      of participants in the web survey. 150 participants are asked to submit blood samples at a&#xD;
      local laboratory in connection with the questionnaires for analysis of inflammatory markers&#xD;
      and one urine sample for analysis of nutritional markers. Two control groups are included,&#xD;
      150 patients with rheumatoid arthritis and 50 healthy individuals. The longitudinal design&#xD;
      makes it possible to investigate how inflammatory markers, nutritional status, symptom&#xD;
      burden, health related quality of life co-vary over time and how work ability and sick leave&#xD;
      is affected.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fatigue is associated with impaired health and severely impaired quality of life and function&#xD;
      and there is a need to explore similarities and differences regarding biopsychosocial&#xD;
      vulnerability and maintenance factors and consequences in terms of work ability and sick&#xD;
      leave in chronic fatigue syndrome (ME / CFS), burnout syndrome (BS) and post-covid fatigue to&#xD;
      be able to improve individualized interventions for patient with persistent fatigue. The&#xD;
      study examines inflammatory markers, nutritional status, symptom burden, neuropsychiatric&#xD;
      conditions, work ability, and sick leave in a longitudinal cohort study over 2 years in&#xD;
      patients with different diagnoses who all suffer from persistent fatigue. The hypothesis is&#xD;
      that there are common biopsychosocial vulnerability factors for developing and maintaining&#xD;
      fatigue, regardless of the diagnosis. The investigators also believe that subgroups can be&#xD;
      identified that differ in terms of these factors. The longitudinal design makes it possible&#xD;
      to investigate how inflammatory markers, nutritional status, symptom burden, health related&#xD;
      quality of life co-vary over time and how work ability and sick leave is affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study participating patients with ME/CFS, BS and post-covid fatigue complete a web&#xD;
      form at inclusion and after 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult patients registered with a diagnosis of chronic complicated fatigue (ME/CFS or&#xD;
      post-covid syndrome) in Take Care (medical record system in Stockholm County, Sweden) or with&#xD;
      burnout syndrome from Stressmottagningen Stockholm, will be asked to participate in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with ME/CFS will be recruited at the Department of Behavior Medicine,&#xD;
           Karolinska University Hospital Solna or reached by advertising on social media&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with Post-covid-syndrome will be recruited at Karolinska University Hospital or&#xD;
           reached by advertising on social media&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with burnout syndrome will be recruited at Stressmottagningen Stockholm&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline, a clinical assessment is performed at the clinic and the patient is asked to&#xD;
      leave a venous blood sample and complete a questionnaire. The patients are asked for further&#xD;
      blood samples and questionnaires at 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after baseline. 150&#xD;
      participants, 50 in each diagnostic group, are asked to submit blood samples for biobanking&#xD;
      at a local laboratory in connection to the questionnaire time points for analysis of&#xD;
      inflammatory markers. C-reactive protein (CRP) is analysed at the time of blood samples. They&#xD;
      are also asked to give one urine sample for analysis of nutritional markers and to submit a&#xD;
      3-day diet diary for evaluation of dietary intake by a registered dietitian. Participants&#xD;
      that only fill out the web-based questionnaire will be included. There is no upper limit for&#xD;
      the number of participants in the web survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pilot study with 20 participants with ME/CFS started in 2018 to test and revise the design&#xD;
      of the present study. These subjects will be counted in the group of 50 participants with&#xD;
      ME/CFS diagnosis when available data allow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the participants with persistent fatigue, two control groups are included in&#xD;
      the study. 150 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) recruited from the Karolinska&#xD;
      University Hospital Rheumatology department and 50 healthy controls. The RA controls fill out&#xD;
      the illness generic questionnaires on paper and disease information is taken from the&#xD;
      national registry for rheumatic disease and CRP and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) data&#xD;
      is taken from the medical record. The healthy controls follow the same procedure as the&#xD;
      patients with persistent fatigue but only fill out the form and give blood samples at one&#xD;
      time point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are there differences in patient reported fatigue dimensions, symptom burden including&#xD;
           post exertional malaise, sleep disorders, health related quality of life, or&#xD;
           inflammatory markers, nutritional markers and dietary intake, between patients with&#xD;
           ME/CFS, BS and post-covid fatigue, patients with RA and healthy controls?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are inflammatory markers and nutritional status associated with the development/recovery&#xD;
           of fatigue and symptom burden in ME/CFS, BS and post-covid fatigue?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Can different subtypes of patients be identified based on latent factor analysis&#xD;
           including fatigue dimensions, symptom profile, neuropsychiatric symptoms, inflammatory&#xD;
           markers and nutritional status?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How does inflammatory markers, nutritional status, symptom burden and health related&#xD;
           quality of life influence work ability and sick leave in patients with persistent&#xD;
           fatigue over time?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project group consists of a multidisciplinary team from Stockholm and Linköping&#xD;
      universities as well as clinically active at clinics in the two regions who often meet&#xD;
      patients with persistent fatigue.&#xD;
