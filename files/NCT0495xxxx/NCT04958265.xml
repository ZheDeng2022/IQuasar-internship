    <description>Participants will be enrolled in three cohorts: [1] Naive Cohort - participants who have not been previously treated with complement inhibitor therapy; [2] Switch Cohort - participants who switch to crovalimab from another C5 inhibitor and [3] Pretreated Cohort (includes C5 SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) participants) - participants who received treatment with another C5 inhibitor and subsequently discontinued it.</description>

    <description>Crovalimab will be administered at a dose of 1000 mg intravenously (IV) (for participants weighing 40 to &lt;100 kg) or 1500 mg IV (for participants weighing &gt;=100 kg) on Week 1 Day 1. On Week 1 Day 2 and on Weeks 2, 3 and 4, crovalimab will be administered at a dose of 340 mg subcutaneously (SC). On Week 5 and Q4W thereafter, it will be administered at a dose of 680 mg SC (for participants weighing 40 to &lt;100 kg) or 1020 mg SC (for participants weighing &gt;=100 kg). Enrollment of participants weighing &lt;40 kg will be staggered using two weight-based dose confirmation groups (Group 1 participants weighing &gt;=20 kg to &lt;40 kg, followed by Group 2 participants weighing &gt;=5 kg to &lt;20 kg). All participants will receive an initial IV loading dose, which will be followed by SC dosing at either Q2W or Q4W intervals (depending on body weight), until study completion.</description>
