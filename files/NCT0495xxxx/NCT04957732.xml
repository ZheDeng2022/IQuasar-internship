  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Irrisept compared&#xD;
      to standard of care treatment of skin and soft tissue infections in the form of abscesses.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After being informed about the trial and potential risks, subjects completed an informed&#xD;
      consent form prior to participation. After eligibility criteria was verified, an initial&#xD;
      wound assessment examination was performed. Subjects were then randomized to the Irrisept or&#xD;
      Standard of Care treatment group. At intervals of 48 hours later, abscesses were assessed&#xD;
      until healing occurred. If the subject required antibiotics, this was recorded, as well as&#xD;
      results from the wound and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) cultures.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Abscess Wound Healing</measure>
    <time_frame>48-hour visit intervals</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint was to determine if the use of pressurized irrigation with Irrisept in uncomplicated abscesses improved wound healing when compared to pressurized irrigation with SoC (normal saline). This was determined by oral antibiotic use, wound improvement, exudation and pain.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Oral Antibiotic Use</measure>
    <time_frame>48-hour visit intervals</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary endpoint was to determine if the use of Irrisept reduced or eliminated the need for oral antibiotics in uncomplicated abscesses. This was determined by evaluating erythema, abscess size, warmth, fluctuance and results of the MRSA/wound culture.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Adverse Events Causality</measure>

    <description>SoC consisted of irrigation with normal saline, using the same proprietary abscess irrigation tip as the Irrisept arm. SoC was used at the initial visit and at each subsequent 48-hour visit interval until abscess healing.</description>

    <description>Irrisept is a manual, self-contained irrigation device capable of producing 7-8 psi of pressure for effective wound cleansing and irrigation. Irrisept contents include the Chlorhexidine Gluconate (CHG) solution, a 450 mL bottle, and Irriprobe applicator or an abscess irrigation tip. The bottle design allows users to control the pressure of the solution through manual bottle compression. The device had an option for use with an Irriprobe applicator or an abscess irrigation tip. Irrisept was used at the initial visit and at each subsequent 48-hour visit interval until abscess healing.</description>
