    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study for the Safety Run-In Cohort is to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of magrolimab in combination with&#xD;
      nab-paclitaxel or paclitaxel in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study for the Randomized Cohorts is to evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
      magrolimab in combination with nab-paclitaxel or paclitaxel in solid tumors as determined by&#xD;
      progression-free survival (PFS) by investigator assessment.&#xD;

             the study protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status&#xD;
             of 0 or 1&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion dependence, defined as requiring more than 2 units of&#xD;
             packed RBC transfusions during the 4-week period prior to screening. RBC transfusions&#xD;

             last 3 months&#xD;

             excipient&#xD;

             alpha-targeting agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current participation in another interventional clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known inherited or acquired bleeding disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant disease or medical conditions, as assessed by the investigator and&#xD;
