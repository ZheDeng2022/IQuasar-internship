  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical outcomes between reattachment of the superior peroneal retinaculum (SPR) and the&#xD;
      bone block procedure were compared in this study to elucidate which procedure was safer and&#xD;
      more effective.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      From 2012 to 2016, 25 patients with recurrent peroneal tendon dislocation underwent the bone&#xD;
      block procedure(group A), and another 22 patients underwent reattachment of the SPR (group&#xD;
      B). American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle society (AOFAS) ankle-hindfoot score, Ankle Activity&#xD;
      Score (AAS), time to return to sports activity, rate of return to sports level, range of&#xD;
      motion (ROM) of the ankle, rate of recurrence, and overall patient satisfaction were&#xD;
      collected to evaluate outcomes between the two groups.&#xD;

    <description>The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) Ankle-Hindfoot Score combines subjective scores of pain and function provided by the patient with objective scores based on the surgeon's physical examination of the patient (to assess sagittal motion, hindfoot motion, ankle-hindfoot stability and alignment of the ankle-hindfoot). The scale includes nine items that can be divided into three subscales (pain, function and alignment). The minimum and maximum values of AOFAS are 100 and 0, respectively. And higher scores mean a better outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>VAS</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years after operation</time_frame>
    <description>The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) is designed to present to the respondent a rating scale with minimum constraints. Respondents mark the location on the 10-centimeter line corresponding to the amount of pain they experienced. This gives them the greatest freedom to choose their pain's exact intensity. It also gives the maximum opportunity for each respondent to express a personal response style. The minimum and maximum values of VAS are 10 and 0, respectively. And higher scores mean a worse outcome.</description>

    <description>two suture anchors (Mini Quickanchor,DePuy Mitek) were inserted into the postero-lateral ridge of the lateral malleolus without damaging the cartilaginous ridge, after which the SPR was reattached to the lateral malleolus with the anchored suture. The inner layer of the false pouch was incised, and the outer layer (periosteum) was sutured with the SPR in a pants-over-vest style.</description>

        A consecutive series of patients with recurrent peroneal tendon dislocation who underwent&#xD;
