  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study intends to strengthen the discussion on the risk factors of RFS in critically ill&#xD;
      patients, and construct an RFS risk prediction model which is easy for clinical medical staff&#xD;
      to use and has a high sensitivity and specificity; In order to help medical staff to identify&#xD;
      the high-risk groups of RFS in critically ill patients efficiently and accurately, and take&#xD;
      targeted care and treatment for patients, so as to reduce the adverse consequences of RFS on&#xD;
      critically ill patients.&#xD;
