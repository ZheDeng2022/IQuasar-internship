    <textblock>
      Cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) is a spinal dysfunction disease common in the elderly&#xD;
      population caused by cervical spine degeneration, spinal canal stenosis, and spinal cord&#xD;
      compression. It may result in reduced quality of life or even disability. With the increased&#xD;
      life expectancy of today's population, the incidence of CSM is increasing. Surgery is&#xD;
      recommended to reduce compression of the spinal cord. However, due to individual differences&#xD;
      and variations in spinal cord injury severity, the prognosis after surgery is often&#xD;
      unpredictable. Therefore, proper evaluation of spinal cord function and prognosis prediction&#xD;
      are important considerations for the clinical decision of whether to operate and selection of&#xD;
      appropriate operation time. To achieve this goal, medical images are used to correctly&#xD;
      evaluate the damage and recovery potential of neurons. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
      provides spinal cord macrostructure details and can detect spinal cord damage. Clinically,&#xD;
      conventional MRI is often used to confirm a CSM diagnosis and predict prognosis. However, MRI&#xD;
      assessments, including increased signal intensity (ISI) and T1 hypo-intensity, might not be&#xD;
      consistent with clinical manifestations or prognostic expectations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diffusion MRI (dMRI) enables early diagnoses and prognostic predictions due to its&#xD;
      microstructure assessment advantages. The diffusion of water molecules is restricted due to&#xD;
      structural barriers, such as axon membranes and myelin sheaths. Using the microscopic&#xD;
      movement of water molecules, dMRI can detect microstructures indirectly using a model with&#xD;
      specific underlying probability distribution function of diffusion. Three models are widely&#xD;
      applied clinically: diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), diffusional kurtosis imaging (DKI), and&#xD;
      neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI). DTI assumes the diffusion&#xD;
      distribution function to be Gaussian, DKI assumes it to be non-Gaussian, and NODDI assumes it&#xD;
      to be multi-compartmental (intracellular pool, extracellular pool, and free water). Previous&#xD;
      studies suggested the potential application value of DTI and DKI in patients with CSM;&#xD;
      however, these models had limited specificity and were not sufficient to diagnose CSM in a&#xD;
      clinical setting. Compared with DTI and DKI, NODDI has been shown to characterize spinal cord&#xD;
      microstructure better.&#xD;
