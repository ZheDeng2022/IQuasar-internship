      Evaluating the performance of the Sofia SARS Antigen FIA&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      RT-PCR is the reference technique for the diagnosis of COVID-19, as recommended by WHO, ECDC&#xD;
      and the HAS College.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serological tests to identify antibodies developed by the immune system following infection&#xD;
      with SARS-CoV-2 are not currently recommended as a first-line test for the initial diagnosis&#xD;
      of COVID-19. However, they can be used in cases of negative RT-PCR and suggestive clinical&#xD;
      presentation, or as a salvage test when RT-PCR could not be performed within 7 days of&#xD;
      symptom onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antigenic tests for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 can be used as a first-line test on&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal swabs up to and including 4 days after the onset of symptoms. From the 5th&#xD;
      day, only detection by gene amplification is indicated. Given their excellent specificity and&#xD;
      the current pandemic situation, it is not necessary to confirm positives with a gene&#xD;
      amplification test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, it is recommended to perform a gene amplification test when the antigenic test&#xD;
      result is negative or uninterpretable in symptomatic patients older than 65 years or with at&#xD;
      least one risk factor for severe COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For contact persons detected in isolation or in clusters, it is also possible to use&#xD;
      antigenic tests in the following cases&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  as soon as possible and then at 7 days for high-risk contacts (within the same household&#xD;
           as an infected patient) ;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  7 days after exposure for other contacts (low risk).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the rapidity of antigenic test results (15 to 30 minutes), the good performance of the&#xD;
      Sofia SARS Antigen FIA test in target populations and its traceability, it could be used as a&#xD;
      first-line test in emergency rooms and screening centers and thus have a positive impact on&#xD;
      the management of ambulatory patients and, by corollary, on viral transmission.&#xD;

        Two nasopharyngeal swabs will be taken per included patient. One will be analyzed by RT-PCR&#xD;
        in the virology laboratory, the other will be analyzed on site with the Sofia SARS Antigen&#xD;
        FIA test. The results of the two tests will then be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
        These samples will not be collected for further research.&#xD;
