    <textblock>
      This observational study will prospectively characterize the long-term symptoms and side&#xD;
      effects of COVID-19 in cohorts of people living with and without HIV. This will be achieved&#xD;
      through a series of remote study visits involving completing surveys about health history,&#xD;
      symptoms, mood, quality of life and changes in health, and up to two blood draws from home&#xD;
      through the use of a mobile phlebotomy service.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational study being conducted to learn about late (2+ weeks or&#xD;
      more) effects of COVID-19 in people living with and without HIV. The investigators plan to do&#xD;
      this by studying people who have COVID-19 and people who have not had COVID-19, and by&#xD;
      studying people living with HIV and people who are HIV-negative. The investigators will&#xD;
      investigate the average duration of symptoms after COVID-19, how these symptoms affect&#xD;
      quality of life, and what medical complications are common after COVID-19 in people with and&#xD;
      without HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation involves:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant completion of surveys about themselves, their health history, their quality&#xD;
           of life and mood in the recent past, and about COVID-19 or HIV if the participant has a&#xD;
           history of either infection. The investigators will ask participants to answer questions&#xD;
           in up to 5 follow-up surveys over the course of a year about their symptoms, mood,&#xD;
           quality of life, and changes in health. Participants will also complete a series of&#xD;
           short tests of thinking, memory, and reaction speed at certain follow-up surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Up to two visits to the participant's home (or an acceptable location of their choosing)&#xD;
           by a phlebotomist. The phlebotomist will collect about 3.5 tablespoons of blood, as well&#xD;
           as measure height, weight, and vital signs when laying down and standing up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a fully remote study and all study activities can be done from home or another&#xD;
      location of the participant's choosing.&#xD;
