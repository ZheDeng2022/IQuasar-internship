      The shift nurses in the top three hospitals in Beijing were included. According to the sample&#xD;
      size calculation method of correlation coefficient in analytical research, the correlation&#xD;
      coefficient between workload and sleep quality was obtained by consulting literature ρ=- 29,&#xD;
      confidence level α= 0.05, β= Then the sample size calculation software pass 11.0 was used to&#xD;
      calculate n = 99. Considering 20% sample loss, the final sample size was n = 119. The same&#xD;
      interviewee (head nurse / nurse) was informed of the purpose and significance of this study&#xD;
      by using the same guiding language. The head nurses were informed one-on-one by the&#xD;
      implementer of the project and filled in the questionnaire after informed consent; The nurse&#xD;
      survey was conducted by the project implementer himself to the head nurse of the Department&#xD;
      for training. The head nurse informed the nurses of the Department with unified guidelines,&#xD;
      and after informed consent, the head nurse sent the electronic questionnaire QR code to its&#xD;
      wechat work group for filling in. The implementer of the project will check the questionnaire&#xD;
      in time after the respondents fill in the questionnaire, and give timely feedback if there is&#xD;
      any doubt. This study investigated the work load and sleep quality of nurses in the top three&#xD;
      hospitals in Beijing; The survey included general information, workload and sleep quality.&#xD;
      General information included gender, age, working years, professional title, education level,&#xD;
      marriage and childbearing status, etc. The workload status includes mental needs, physical&#xD;
      needs, time needs, self performance, effort, frustration, technical autonomy, decision-making&#xD;
      autonomy and work needs. The sleep quality status of nurses in different shifts (day shift,&#xD;
      night shift and night shift) included sleep disorder, difficulty in maintaining sleep, early&#xD;
      wake-up, fatigue / sleepiness in working days and idle time in working days, etc.&#xD;
