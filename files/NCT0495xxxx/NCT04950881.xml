  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In ophthalmic surgery, surgical operations such as pulling certain eye tissues or compressing&#xD;
      the eyeball often leads to bradycardia, arrhythmia even cardiac arrest, bradypnea, nausea and&#xD;
      vomiting and elevated blood sugar level. The condition is called the ocularvagal reflex&#xD;
      (OVR). Traditionally, when the bradycardia or arrhythmia happens, the operation has to be&#xD;
      suspended, and atropine or isoproterenol is given intravenously to treat the bradycardia.&#xD;
      Vagus nerve block may be an effective way to prevent and alleviate this vagal reflex. However&#xD;
      it is difficult to perform the nerve block with anatomical landmark (blind) methods. In this&#xD;
      study, the investigators used ultrasound-guided right cervical vagus nerve block to reduce&#xD;
      the incidence of the OVR. The researchers hypothesized that low concentrations of lidocaine&#xD;
      can block the right cervical vagus nerve and reduce the incidence of intraoperative OVR.&#xD;
      Researchers evaluated the changes of heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and&#xD;
      airway pressure in patients undergoing high-risk OVR surgery.&#xD;

    <description>Conventional monitor and treatment The surgery is performed after patient is under general anesthesia. If patient's heart rate significantly slows down or bradycardia/arrhythmia happens, the surgeon will be asked to suspend the operation. Meanwhile, atropine (0.01-0.02mg/kg) is given intravenously to increase the heart rate. If atropine fails to increase the heart rate, isoproterenol (1-2 μg/per time) will be given intravenously to increase the heart rate.</description>

    <description>After the patient is under general anesthesia, an attending physicians perform the ultrasound-guided cervical vagus nerve block (using a 50mm Braun nerve stimulation needle, and the patients were injected with 10ml of lidocaine). Then the operation starts. If patient's heart rate significantly slows down or bradycardia/arrhythmia happens, the surgeon will be asked to suspend the operation. Meanwhile, atropine (0.01-0.02mg/kg) is given intravenously to increase the heart rate. If atropine fails to increase the heart rate, isoproterenol (1-2 μg/per time) will be given intravenously to increase the heart rate. After endotracheal tube is removed, the patient will be followed up for next 24 hours.</description>
