  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-atopic dermatitis (NAD) or eczema is a common inflammatory condition; potentially&#xD;
      debilitating that can compromise quality of life. It is usually seen in childhood, but can&#xD;
      onset within or persist into adulthood.&#xD;

      Polarized ultraviolet-free polychromatic light is used as therapeutic option for the&#xD;
      treatment of wound healing and dermatological conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      40 male patients who had atopic dermatitis in the chronic stage, they were complaining from&#xD;
      itching, inflammation and skin thickness in the arm, wrist, hand and leg will participate in&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;

    <time_frame>1-2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The SCORAD (Index) is the best validated scoring system in atopic dermatitis, To measure the extent of AD, the rule of nines is applied on a front/back drawing of the patient's inflammatory lesions. The extent can be graded from 0 to 100. The intensity part of the SCORAD consists of 6 items: erythema, oedema/papulation, excoriations, lichenification, oozing/crusts and dryness. Each item can be graded on a scale from 0 to 3. The subjective items include daily pruritus and sleeplessness. The SCORAD Index formula is: A/5 + 7B/2 + C. In this formula A is defined as the extent (0-100), B is defined as the intensity (0-18) and C is defined as the subjective symptoms (0-20). The maximal score of the SCORAD Index is 103. The objective SCORAD consist of the extent and the intensity items; the formula is A/5 + 7B/2. The maximal objective SCORAD score is 83 (with 10 additional points for severe disfiguring eczema of the face and hands).</description>
