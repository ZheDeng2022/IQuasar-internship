  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In industrialised countries, it is estimated that about 15% of couples who wish to have a&#xD;
      child are currently facing infertility problems, of which, in half of the cases, an anomaly&#xD;
      in sperm quality or at least a factor of male origin is identified. The evaluation of sperm&#xD;
      quality in males is based, for the most part, on the micro and macroscopic examination of&#xD;
      various parameters (concentration, motility, physical abnormalities of the spermatozoa,&#xD;
      etc.). Nevertheless, an increasing number of scientific studies have shown that the quality&#xD;
      of sperm DNA, and in particular its fragmentation rate, is also associated with a lower&#xD;
      fertilisation rate. The integrity of sperm DNA may be affected by an imbalance in the Red/Ox&#xD;
      balance leading to uncompensated oxidative stress, and could be restored or improved by&#xD;
      dietary hygiene measures and the consumption of specific dietary products. The ISITOL&#xD;
      clinical study aims to evaluate the efficacy of a dietary supplement specifically formulated&#xD;
      to target the various issues associated with male infertility, and in particular to&#xD;
      contribute to the improvement of the sperm DNA fragmentation rate. The efficacy of the&#xD;
      dietary supplement Isitol® (GYNOV SAS) on sperm DNA fragmentation rate and other secondary&#xD;
      parameters is being evaluated through a single-centre, prospective, randomised, double-blind,&#xD;
      interventional vs. placebo clinical study being conducted in France at Laboratoire Drouot (21&#xD;
      Rue Drouot - 75009 Paris - France) and led by Dr. Nino-Guy Cassuto. A total of 72 men aged&#xD;
      between 20 and 45 years, with sperm DNA fragmentation rate ≥ 30% and with negative semen&#xD;
      culture are recruited. The recruited patients were randomized in a 1:1 scheme into 2 groups&#xD;
      (Isitol® treated vs placebo treated).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infertility is generally defined as a partner's failure to conceive after at least 12 months&#xD;
      off contraception and is steadily increasing worldwide. In industrialised countries, it is&#xD;
      estimated that around 15% of couples who wish to have a child are now facing it, and in half&#xD;
      of the cases, an abnormality in sperm quality or at least a male factor is identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In males, the measurement of male fertility is mainly based on analyses that assess sperm&#xD;
      quality macroscopically (spermiogram, spermocytogram) by evaluating the number, morphology,&#xD;
      motility, presence of abnormalities, etc. These indicators are still considered to be the&#xD;
      preferred indicators for assessing male fertility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, since the mid-2000s, numerous in vitro and in vivo studies in humans and&#xD;
      animals have shown that the integrity of sperm DNA, assessed by measuring the rate of DNA&#xD;
      fragmentation and chromatin decondensation in spermatozoa, could be a relevant parameter in&#xD;
      the etiology of male infertility. Furthermore, it has been observed that the rate of sperm&#xD;
      DNA fragmentation is inversely correlated with pregnancy rate, success rate of assisted&#xD;
      reproductive techniques and embryo quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major identified cause of direct damage to DNA molecules and their possible&#xD;
      fragmentation, but also to proteins and cell membranes in spermatozoa is oxidative stress.&#xD;
      Unreduced Reactive oxygen species produced in the mitochondria-rich midpiece in excess are&#xD;
      susceptible to damage the DNA in the sperm head. Several exogenous factors such as exposure&#xD;
      to toxins, smoking, alcohol or unbalanced diet are also associated with promoting oxidative&#xD;
      stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A fragmentation rate higher than 30% is considered high, it is indicative of altered&#xD;
      chromatin and especially associated with a low probability of conceiving naturally or through&#xD;
      in vitro techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To resolve this problem and improve the process of spermatogenesis and fertilisation, it is&#xD;
      relevant to evaluate the effectiveness of a food supplement (Isitol®), manufactured and&#xD;
      marketed by the company Gynov SAS (2B Rue Sauteyron - 33000 Bordeaux - France), which&#xD;
      provides myo-inositol and a complex with antioxidant properties based on N-acetyl-cysteine,&#xD;
      group B vitamins (B2, B3, B6, B9), vitamin E and zinc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to providing the nutrients that contribute to a better management of the reactive&#xD;
      oxygen species, the food supplement provides myo-inositol, which is essential for the&#xD;
      functioning of a wide range of cellular functions. This molecule, related to glucose, is&#xD;
      produced in the testis, mainly by Sertoli cells, and is excreted into the seminiferous&#xD;
      tubules as a gradient. This gradient contributes to sperm maturation by reducing sperm&#xD;
      viscosity and increasing sperm motility. Numerous studies evaluating the impact of&#xD;
      myo-inositol have shown a significant improvement in sperm parameters (concentration,&#xD;
      motility, morphology) and in particular in the rate of sperm DNA fragmentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to evaluate the efficacy of this dietary supplement, a single-centre, prospective,&#xD;
      randomised, double-blind, interventional vs. placebo clinical study was set up in France at&#xD;
      Laboratoire Drouot (21 Rue Drouot - 75009 Paris - France) and directed by Dr. Nino-Guy&#xD;
      Cassuto. A total of 72 men aged between 20 and 45 years, with sperm DNA fragmentation rate ≥&#xD;
      30% and with negative semen culture are recruited. The recruited patients were randomised in&#xD;
      a 1:1 design into 2 groups (Isitol® treated vs placebo treated).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis is that after 16 (± 2) weeks of treatment with the dietary supplement,&#xD;
      the expected decrease in sperm DNA fragmentation rate will be ≥ 23% compared to the placebo&#xD;
      treated group to validate the efficacy hypothesis. The measurement of the sperm DNA&#xD;
      fragmentation rate is performed by TUNEL (Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP&#xD;
      (deoxyuridine triphosphate) nick end labeling) method. The secondary objectives are the&#xD;
      evaluation of classical sperm parameters (spermiogram, spermocytogram), sperm morphology&#xD;
      score, chromatin decondensation rate, sperm red/ox potential, differential expression of 11&#xD;
      specific genes involved in spermatogenesis and/or at different stages of the fertilisation&#xD;
      process (AURKA, CCDC60, CCDC88B, etc.)).&#xD;

    <time_frame>Red/ox potential measurement is realised at first Visit (V0) and at the last Visit (V2) after 16 +/- 2 weeks of treatment with Isitol or placebo</time_frame>
    <description>The measurement of the semen Red/Ox potential is performed using the MiOXSYS measuring device (Aytu Bioscience 373 Inverness Parkway - Englewood, CO 80112 USA). This device measures the static oxidation reduction potential (sORP) of a biological sample, in this case human semen. The sORP has been described as an integrated measure of the balance between total oxidative activity (including reactive oxygen species) and total reducing activity. Therefore, the level of oxidative stress (increase in oxidative species and/or decrease in antioxidant activity) can be quantified electrically using an sORP sensor. The result is indicated in mV and the increase in sORP is correlated with an increase in the level of oxidative stress. The relative sORP is obtained after weighting by concentration in spermatozoa and expressed in mV/millions (10^6)/mL.</description>

    <time_frame>Genes expression measurement is realised at first Visit (V0) and at the last Visit (V2) after 16 +/- 2 weeks of treatment with Isitol or placebo</time_frame>
    <description>The expression level of the AURKA, CCDC60, CCDC88B, CFAP46, HDAC4, CACNA1C, CACNA1H, CARHSP1, DNAH2, HMGB4 and SPATA18 genes in spermatozoa will be measured using an RT-qPCR (Reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction) technique with specific primer pairs. The different mRNAs will be extracted from spermatozoa using an extraction kit (miRNeasy Kit (QIAGEN)). Using primers specific to each of the genes studied, the mRNAs of these genes of interest will be back-transcribed into complementary DNA and then amplified according to a determined number of replication cycles (45 cycles). By measuring the fluorescence intensity in each of the cells, the concentration of complementary DNA is calculated. The relative expression of these different genes is obtained after normalisation using two ubiquitous and constant expression genes.</description>
