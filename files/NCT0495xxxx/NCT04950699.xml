      Coronary heart disease and myocardial infarction have become a major threat to the health of&#xD;
      our people. Their incidence rate and mortality rate are still rising. Dyslipidemia is one of&#xD;
      the important risk factors. However, little is known about the genetic information of&#xD;
      myocardial infarction and dyslipidemia, especially in Chinese population. This project aims&#xD;
      to identify new loci related to myocardial infarction and blood lipid level in Chinese&#xD;
      population, compare these gene variations with 94 gene variations related to myocardial&#xD;
      infarction and blood lipid level in European population, and extract gene variations related&#xD;
      to myocardial infarction and blood lipid level in Chinese population. In this case-control&#xD;
      study, 3998 blood samples and 702 new blood samples were collected from the sample bank of&#xD;
      Peking University Third Hospital and first hospital, respectively. The blood samples were&#xD;
      collected from Asian heart disease hospital, Taiyuan cardiovascular disease hospital, Beijing&#xD;
      Third Hospital and Shijingshan community follow-up population According to the results of&#xD;
      carotid ultrasound or treadmill exercise test, the samples were divided into myocardial&#xD;
      infarction group and control group, and the corresponding blood lipid levels were collected.&#xD;
      The samples were genotyped by the metabochip gene chip of Illumina company. The data were&#xD;
      processed by the calling algorithm of BeadStudio Gentrain 1.0 and the GenoSNP software. The&#xD;
      related genes of myocardial infarction were analyzed by logistic regression, and the related&#xD;
      genes of blood lipid level were analyzed by linear regression.&#xD;

      Background: coronary heart disease and myocardial infarction have become a major disease&#xD;
      threatening the health of our people. Their incidence rate and mortality rate are still&#xD;
      rising. Dyslipidemia is one of the important risk factors. However, little is known about the&#xD;
      genetic information of myocardial infarction and dyslipidemia, especially in Chinese&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: to identify new loci related to myocardial infarction and blood lipid level in&#xD;
      Chinese population, compare these gene variations with 94 gene variations related to&#xD;
      myocardial infarction and blood lipid level in European population, and extract gene&#xD;
      variations related to myocardial infarction and blood lipid level in Chinese population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This is a case-control study. 9498 blood samples and 702 new blood samples were&#xD;
      collected from the sample bank of Peking University Third Hospital and first hospital&#xD;
      respectively. The blood samples were collected from Asian heart disease hospital, Beijing&#xD;
      Third Hospital and Shijingshan community follow-up population According to the results of&#xD;
