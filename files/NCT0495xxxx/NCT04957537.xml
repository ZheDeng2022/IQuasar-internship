  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to measure the effect of a semantic rehabilitation protocol for patients&#xD;
      with primary progressive semantic aphasia and using the SCED methodology.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The damage on the semantic system is at the heart of the clinical picture of semantic primary&#xD;
      progressive aphasia (PPA), a neuro-evolutionary pathology. In other words, patients gradually&#xD;
      lose access to concepts, general knowledge, word memory and meaning. In the absence of&#xD;
      effective pharmacological treatment to reduce the symptoms evoked by patients and improve&#xD;
      their quality of life, the arguments in favour of speech and language therapy are&#xD;
      multiplying.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous lexico-semantic multimodal indication therapies have been described in scientific&#xD;
      studies. The most studied is semantic rehabilitation through the analysis of semantic&#xD;
      features, which has shown its effectiveness in the context of vascular and post-traumatic&#xD;
      aphasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there are only few studies and applications in neuro-evolutionary pathologies such&#xD;
      as semantic PPA and those studies are complicated by methodological biases. It has been shown&#xD;
      that relearned knowledge is more likely to be retained and transferred to everyday life&#xD;
      (generalisation) if the material used is specific to the needs of each individual. Given the&#xD;
      heterogeneity of clinical profiles in neuro-evolving pathologies and the inter-individual&#xD;
      variability, the personalised approach should be favoured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the effect of semantic therapy in patients with semantic PPA, this study&#xD;
      therefore proposes to use the SCED (Single Case Experimental Design) methodology. In addition&#xD;
      to allowing an individual analysis, this methodology has the advantage of corresponding to a&#xD;
      high level of evidence due to the acquisition of repeated measures and the randomisation of&#xD;
      the introduction of the treatment.&#xD;

Single Case Experimental Design&quot; type study in multiple baselines with 2 successive phases (A-B design) for each patient. For each subject, phase A constitutes the baseline (6 to 8 weeks), phase B is characterised by semantic rehabilitation (5 weeks). The beginning of the intervention will be sequential and the duration of the baseline will be randomised for each patient.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Patients will be followed over two periods &quot;Phase A (randomized, 6 to 8 weeks) - Phase B (5 weeks)&quot;.&#xD;
Phase A : Baseline Phase A, which constitutes the control period of semantic therapy, will be composed of lexico-phonological training exercises (Piroux-Davous, 2018). This phase will last 6 to 8 weeks (i.e. 18 to 24 sessions) depending on the randomisation, at the rate of 3 speech therapy sessions of 45 minutes per week.&#xD;
Phase B : Semantic re-education The sessions will consist of training based on the analysis of semantic traits (Coustaut, 2019). This phase will last 5 weeks (i.e. 15 sessions), at the rate of 3 speech therapy sessions of 45 minutes per week.&#xD;
In accordance with the application of the SCED methodology, repeated measurements will be carried out every second session during phases A and B. They will consist of proposing the oral naming task (lasting 10 minutes).</description>
