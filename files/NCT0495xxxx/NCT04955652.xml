  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess, prospectively, the effect of provider-facing alerts&#xD;
      for bone densitometry scans with and without a single-click best practice alert (BPA) on scan&#xD;
      orders and completions. The investigators hypothesize that the remaining alerts left in place&#xD;
      (via health maintenance topics and an actionable item in the electronic health record&#xD;
      sidebar) will be as effective without the BPA compared to the alerts with a BPA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Standard care for bone densitometry scans at Geisinger--i.e., dual-energy x-ray&#xD;
      absorptiometry (DXA) scans--involves (1) an alert under the health maintenance topics tab in&#xD;
      Epic, (2) an actionable item in a sidebar (Storyboard), (3) and a single-click best practice&#xD;
      alert (BPA). Storyboard and the BPA theoretically serve a redundant function, but it is&#xD;
      possible that combined alerting is effective. Therefore, the investigators plan to evaluate&#xD;
      whether the BPA for DXA scans will increase the percentage of DXA scans ordered and&#xD;
      completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this evaluation, the investigators will randomly assign (by odd and even MRN) half of&#xD;
      patients who need DXA scans to go through standard care (including the single-click BPA) and&#xD;
      half of patients to have no BPA shown to their provider, but only the health maintenance&#xD;
      topic and actionable Storyboard alert. This evaluation will help the investigators determine&#xD;
      whether redundant, more traditional alerts such as BPAs are helpful or can be removed from&#xD;
      alerts for DXA scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomization of patients to different alert conditions will be in place until 4,200&#xD;
      participants have been reached (estimated sample to detect 4% absolute difference, rounded to&#xD;
      nearest hundred) or 6 months, whichever comes first. To account for delays in updating&#xD;
      clinical databases, the outcome data will pulled 3 months after each encounter (for a maximum&#xD;
      study period of 9 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main analysis will use a logistic regression to compare the two groups. Exploratory&#xD;
      analyses will also examine the time from order to completion to examine any effect on timing&#xD;
      between arms. Another set of exploratory analyses will also examine the number of other BPAs&#xD;
      firing to see if alert fatigue influenced the number of orders or completions or interacted&#xD;
      with the experimental conditions.&#xD;

    <masking_description>The participants and providers will not know that alerts were randomized. Participants will not know the arm to which they were assigned. Providers might notice that a given participant did or did not receive a certain alert, but this is expected to be unlikely, given the volume of alerts to which providers are exposed constantly.</masking_description>
