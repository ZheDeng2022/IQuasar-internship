      Background: In the last several years, commercial pharmacogenetic (PGx) testing for the&#xD;
      selection of psychotropic medications has become widespread as a means of implementing&#xD;
      &quot;precision medicine&quot;, with some insurers electing to cover the cost of testing. Mostly these&#xD;
      efforts have focused on the decision of choosing a medication. Polypharmacy has become&#xD;
      widespread and often the norm in patients with more severe of chronic illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: This project is designed to evaluate the utility of PGx testing in reducing&#xD;
      polypharmacy among Veterans with mental illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The project is a randomized clinical trial in which 500 Veterans will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to have the results of the PGx battery available to clinical staff right after&#xD;
      randomization (i.e., the intervention group) or after 3 months of treatment as usual (i.e.,&#xD;
      the delayed results group). The study will test the following primary hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Veterans with psychiatric illness and currently receiving an antidepressant and at least&#xD;
           one additional psychotropic medication whose care is guided by the results of the PGx&#xD;
           battery (the intervention group) will have a higher rate of reduction in polypharmacy&#xD;
           than those in the delayed results group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Veterans whose care is guided by the results of the PGx battery (the intervention group)&#xD;
           will have a higher rate of improvement in depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 score) than the&#xD;
           delayed results group.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Genomic testing has the potential to improve patient outcomes and reduce patient care costs&#xD;
      through personalizing medication selection. Commercial pharmacogenetic (PGx) testing for&#xD;
      psychotropic and other medications has become widely available and is advertised as providing&#xD;
      the means to implement &quot;precision medicine.&quot; As a consequence, some insurers (e.g., the&#xD;
      Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)) have elected to cover the cost of PGx&#xD;
      testing. While there is evidence for this approach in other areas of medicine, clinical&#xD;
      application to psychiatry has proceeded without sufficient scientific study. Nonetheless, the&#xD;
      commercialization of genomic testing has led to increased pressure on the Veterans Health&#xD;
      Administration (VHA) to implement a mental health focused PGx testing program, especially for&#xD;
      treating depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While there is evidence that genetic variation affects the metabolism of psychotropic&#xD;
      medications and genetic testing has been commercialized, the clinical utility of these&#xD;
      findings has yet to be established. Moreover, implementing such tests in routine care is&#xD;
      complex, requiring a systematic approach to ensure efficiency, effectiveness, and an&#xD;
      appropriate understanding of its clinical implications. As a first step in bridging this&#xD;
      implementation gap, the VA is conducting a randomized clinical trial (RCT) to evaluate the&#xD;
      utility of PGx texting in treating Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with monotherapy; this&#xD;
      trial, known as PRIME Care, is currently underway and seeking to randomize 2000 veterans&#xD;
      across 20 plus sites. The current proposed project is an RCT to evaluate the utility of PGx&#xD;
      testing in managing patients on multiple psychotropic medications. The project will be known&#xD;
      as the PRIME Care 2.0 study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A PGx trial with a focus on patients on multiple psychotropic medications is an important&#xD;
      next step for many reasons. Patients requiring polypharmacy are by definition harder and more&#xD;
      complex to treat and they require more health care visits to manage. Thus, this population is&#xD;
      at high risk of adverse outcomes and costly to the healthcare system. The pathway by which a&#xD;
      patient ends up on multiple medications is complex but often results from decisions made in&#xD;
      response to a partial or complete lack of efficacy, with the addition of a medication to&#xD;
      augment treatment or an attempt to manage multiple symptoms without considering the&#xD;
      underlying etiology (i.e. sleep, addiction, and depression). Irrespective of the path,&#xD;
      polypharmacy has substantial risks that include increased risk for suicide, greater exposure&#xD;
      to toxicity of medications, and greater difficulties adhering to a complex medication&#xD;
      regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.0 Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, we propose to conduct an RCT (n=500) in which Veteran participants will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to have the results of the PGx battery available right after randomization&#xD;
      (i.e., the intervention group) or after 3 months of treatment as usual (i.e., the delayed&#xD;
      results group). We will use a pragmatic study design in which front line providers are&#xD;
      managing their own patients and interpreting results with their own patient in a shared&#xD;
      decision-making process. The study will test the following hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Veterans with psychiatric illness and currently receiving an antidepressant and at least&#xD;
           one additional psychotropic medication whose care is guided by the results of the PGx&#xD;
           battery (the intervention group) will have a higher rate of reduction in polypharmacy&#xD;
           than those in the delayed results group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Veterans whose care is guided by the results of the PGx battery (the intervention group)&#xD;
           will have a higher rate of improvement in depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 score) than the&#xD;
           delayed results group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary hypotheses include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Veterans in the intervention group will have better secondary outcomes than the delayed&#xD;
      results group, including suicidal ideation, depression, anxiety, and Substance Use Disorder&#xD;
      (SUD) symptom severity [measured using the Brief Addiction Monitor (BAM)], side effect rate,&#xD;
      treatment adherence rate, number of outpatient visits, and functional improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the primary and secondary aims of the project, exploratory aims will include&#xD;
      examining other outcome markers and examining other genetic markers that may predict&#xD;
      treatment using Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) methods.&#xD;
