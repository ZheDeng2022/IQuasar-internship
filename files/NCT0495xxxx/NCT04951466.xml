  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to conduct an 8-week RCT to improve insomnia among black women&#xD;
      with insomnia and evaluate its feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of Mindfulness Based&#xD;
      Therapy for Insomnia (MBTI)&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study design is a randomized clinical trial (RCT) with attention control. Participants will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to participate in either Mindfulness Based Therapy for Insomnia (MBTI)&#xD;
      or time and attention control. Participants in the experimental group will receive the MBTI&#xD;
      that includes mindfulness meditation and behavioral strategies for sleep. Participants in the&#xD;
      control group will receive healthy lifestyle education that includes healthy eating, physical&#xD;
      activity and sleep hygiene practice to mitigate insomnia.&#xD;

    <measure>Retention</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Retention will be measured in the study. The following information will be collected: percentage of participants completing baseline and follow-up assessments, reasons for dropouts</description>
  </primary_outcome>

    <measure>Change in Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 10</time_frame>
    <description>The Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) will be used to measure adherence to the study protocol. The FFMQ Short Form has 24 items. Responses in the scale are made on a 5-point Likert Scale. Total FFMQ can be divided by 24 to get an average item score. The five facets, or five key aspects of mindfulness that the test measures acts as the mediator of therapeutic change and mindful interventions. Higher score means higher level in mindfulness practice.</description>

    <measure>Change in Daily Food and Activity Diary - Control group only</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 10</time_frame>
    <description>Daily Food and Activity Diary will be used to measure adherence of the control participants in their daily food intake and physical activity levels. Participants in control group will be asked to record meal/snack and type/duration of physical activity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Fidelity</measure>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Mindfulness Practice Log - Experimental group only</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 10</time_frame>
    <description>The Mindfulness practice logs: will be used to measure adhere of the experimental group participants. Participants in experimental group will be asked to record the total minutes of mindfulness practice and the number of meditation session during the intervention period.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Insomnia severity score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 10</time_frame>
    <description>The reliable and valid Insomnia severity Index (ISI) for clinical diagnosis for insomnia (ICSD) will be used to determine insomnia severity score. Clinical cut points for ISI are as follows: no insomnia (0-7), sub-threshold insomnia (8-14), moderate insomnia (15-21), and severe insomnia (22-28). Response to the intervention on the ISI will be defined as a meaningful change of 7 or more points from baseline, or remission as reduction to a score less than 8.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in total sleep time</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 10</time_frame>
    <description>Total sleep time or duration is computed by asking participants what time they wake-up and what time they go to bed (range from 0 min-1440 min).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in wake after sleep onset</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 10</time_frame>
    <description>Wake after sleep onset (WASO) is the amount of wake time in minutes during the attempted sleeping period after sleep onset has been achieved.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in sleep onset latency</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 10</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep onset latency is the amount of time, in minutes, it takes a person to fall asleep. It begins at &quot;light out' when the lights are turned off and the person attempts to fall asleep, and ends at sleep onset. A sleep latency of 10-20 minutes is considered normal.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in sleep efficiency and quality</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 10</time_frame>
    <description>Will be measured by a wrist sleep actigraphy and sleep diary. Sleep efficiency is defined by the ratio of total sleep time to time in bed. Normal sleep efficiency for a healthy adult is 90% or higher. Sleep quality will be collected by participant's self-report using a 0-10 numerical scale (higher score means better sleep quality)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Cortisol</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 10</time_frame>
    <description>Cortisol measures levels of salivary stress. Within-group changes, compared with control, of cortisol biomarkers outcomes will be measured. Test volume, lower limit of sensitivity, range of calibrators are as follows: 25 ul, .007 ug/dl, .012 - 3.0 ug/dl for cortisol</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in C-reactive protein [CRP]</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 10</time_frame>
    <description>Within-group changes, compared with control, of C-reactive protein [CRP] biomarkers outcomes will be measured. Test volume, lower limit of sensitivity, range of calibrators are as follows: 100 ul, 9.72 pg/ml, 25-1600 pg/ml for CRP.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in cytokines [IL-1β, IL-6, TNF- α])</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 10</time_frame>
    <description>Within-group changes, compared with control, of cytokines [IL-1β, IL-6, TNF- α]) biomarkers outcomes will be measured. Test volume, lower limit of sensitivity, range of calibrators are as follows: 60 ul, .07 pg/ml, 0-100 pg/ml for IL-6.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in perceived stress score (PSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 10</time_frame>
    <description>The PSS has 10 items. It measures feelings and stressful thoughts for the past month. PSS ranges from 0 to 40 with higher scores indicating higher perceived stress. Scores ranging from 0-13 would be considered low stress. Scores ranging from 14-26 would be considered moderate stress. Scores ranging from 27-40 would be considered high perceived stress.</description>
