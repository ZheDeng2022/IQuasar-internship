      1. Compare the effect of virtual single energy imaging and virtual single energy combined&#xD;
      with MAR technology to remove metal artifacts in the spine. 2. Discuss the most suitable KeV&#xD;
      of virtual single energy imaging combined with MAR technology to remove metal artifacts.&#xD;

      The virtual single-energy imaging of energy spectrum CT combined with the metal artifact&#xD;
      reduction technology MARS Multi Artifact Reduction System] can effectively reduce the&#xD;
      interference of metal artifacts. This is because MAR technology corrects the image through an&#xD;
      iterative algorithm, improves the spatial resolution, and restores the details of the&#xD;
      adjacent tissue of the metal object. Virtual single-energy imaging technology can effectively&#xD;
      reduce hardening artifacts. The two are used in combination to achieve the purpose of&#xD;
      reducing metal artifacts. There have been articles about virtual single energy combined with&#xD;
      MAR technology to reduce metal artifacts. However, the current researches mostly focus on the&#xD;
      comparison of virtual single energy combined with MAR technology and conventional CT&#xD;
      examination and virtual single energy imaging. There are few evaluations on the severity of&#xD;
      metal artifacts after spinal surgery. According to different surgical methods, metal The&#xD;
      difference in the number of implants will result in different artifact reduction effects.&#xD;
      Secondly, the current research on the suitable KeV of virtual single energy combined with MAR&#xD;
      technology to reduce metal artifacts is less discussed and reported.&#xD;
