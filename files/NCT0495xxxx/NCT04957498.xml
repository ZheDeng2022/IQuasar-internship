      adolescents between the ages of 12 and 18 diagnosed with Anorexia Nervosa. Preliminary data&#xD;

      In this study, families will be randomized to either receive 12 weekly online sessions of&#xD;
      Guided Self-Help for Family Based Treatment (GSH-FBT), or 15 sessions of online,&#xD;
      professionally delivered, standard FBT over the course of 6 months. Potential subjects will&#xD;
      be recruited from Stanford University, McMaster University, other local medical programs and&#xD;
      clinics, and online advertisement to the population at large. If participants are deemed&#xD;
      eligible, participants will be invited for a baseline interview during which the&#xD;
      investigators will conduct interviews and collect questionnaire measures. Participants will&#xD;
      complete a follow-up interview at the end of treatment and 3-month after end of treatment.&#xD;
