  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endodontic treatment aims to eliminate pathogenic microbes from the root canal. Hyperpure&#xD;
      chlorine dioxide is an endodontic irrigant. Our goal is to compare the efficacy of hyperpure&#xD;
      chlorine dioxide with the gold standard sodium hypochlorite in the non-surgical retreatment&#xD;
      of root canal treated teeth with chronic periapical lesions in a randomized clinical trial.&#xD;
      Forty patients having chronic apical periodontitis will randomly be chosen for the study from&#xD;
      the patients attending our Department of Conservative Dentistry. Endodontic treatment will be&#xD;
      done according to professional quidelines. The patients will randomly be divided into two&#xD;
      groups. In the first (control) group sodium hypochlorite, in the second group hyperpure&#xD;
      chlorine dioxide will be used as desinfectant. The first sample will be taken from the root&#xD;
      canal after removing the previous root canal obturation prior to desinfection. The second&#xD;
      sample will be taken one week after temporization. The samples will be evaluated by&#xD;
      culturing, MALDI-ToF and PCR strip test. After root canal obturation the the periapical&#xD;
      status will be followed by clinical evaluation and control x-rays.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Endodontic treatment aims to eliminate pathogenic microbes from the root canal. This is an&#xD;
      almost impossible task as microbes, especially Enterococci are able to line the dentin&#xD;
      tubules that are nearly unaccessable to desifectants used during treatment. Hyperpure&#xD;
      chlorine dioxide is an endodontic irrigant. In vitro studies proved it to be a very potent&#xD;
      desinfectant against which bacteria do not produce resistency (Herczegh et al., 2013 a,b,&#xD;
      2014). It selectively binds to three amino acids targeting bacterial cells (Nosztíciusz et&#xD;
      al., 2013). Due to its small molecular weight and its highly volatile characteristics we&#xD;
      presume that it is able to penetrate into the small dentin tubuli. There have been many in&#xD;
      vitro studies comparing its characteristics and efficacy, but there have been no in vivo&#xD;
      studies done to approve its clinical preformance so far. Our goal is to compare the efficacy&#xD;
      of hyperpure chlorine dioxide with the gold standard sodium hypochlorite in the non-surgical&#xD;
      retreatment of root canal treated teeth with chronic periapical lesions in a randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial. Its efficacy will be compared by microbiological methods and by clinical and&#xD;
      radiological evaluation. According to our hypothesis hyperpure chlorine dioxide is more&#xD;
      effective antimicrobial agent than the gold standard sodium hypochlorite. The protocol for&#xD;
      this clinical study was approved by the Hungarian National Ethics Committee for clinical&#xD;
      trials. Forty patients having chronic apical periodontitis will randomly be chosen for the&#xD;
      study from the patients attending our Department of Conservative Dentistry. Written consent&#xD;
      will be collected from the patients. Only those patients will be accepted who had the root&#xD;
      canal treatment done more than four years ago, the tooth is asymptomatic, functionally and&#xD;
      esthetically restorable, the coronal restoration can be done within 3-4 weeks of the root&#xD;
      canal obturation, who will not have prosthetic or orthodontic treatment interfering with the&#xD;
      radiological follow-up and have no general medical conditions or medication influencing the&#xD;
      healing of the periapical lesion. Endodontic treatment will be done according to professional&#xD;
      quidelines. After sterilizing the tooth and its environment, a sterility test will be be done&#xD;
      by taking samples from the top of the restoration (S1) and from the pulp chamber (S2). The&#xD;
      root canal obturation will be removed mechanically and a microbiological sample will be taken&#xD;
      from the root canal (M1). After taking the sample from the root canal the tooth will be&#xD;
      chemomechanically prepared. The patients will randomly be divided into two groups. In the&#xD;
      first (control) group sodium hypochlorite, in the second group hyperpure chlorine dioxide&#xD;
      will be used as desinfectant. The sample taking procedure will be repeated after one week of&#xD;
      temporization (sterility tests S3, S4 and root canal sample M2). The samples will be cultured&#xD;
      and identified by MALDI-ToF MS. The remaining samples will be used for PCR testing&#xD;
      (Micro-IDent Plus11, Hain Lifescience) to determine the presence of the tested bacteria. In&#xD;
      the second session the root canal obturation will be completed. Following coronal restoration&#xD;
      a control x-ray will be done by using an individual bite-block for standardization. The&#xD;
      success of the root canal treatment will be followed-up by evaluating the periapical status&#xD;
      with the Periapical Index scoring system (Ostravik etal., 1986) and clinical evaluation&#xD;
      according to the criteria set by the European Society of Endodontology (ESE 2006) including&#xD;
      pain assessment where the patients rate pain on the VNRS, with 0 = ''no pain'' to 10 =&#xD;
      ''worst pain imaginable&quot;. Clinical evaluation and control x-rays will be done at 6 months, 1,&#xD;
      2, 3, and 4 years following treatment. The x-rays will be evaluated by two blinded calibrated&#xD;
      examiners.&#xD;
