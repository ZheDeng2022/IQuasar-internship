  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Embryo implantation depends on two main factors: embryo grading quality and endometrial&#xD;
      receptivity.Numerous tools have been suggested to evaluate these two factors. Measurement of&#xD;
      the pulsatility index (PI) of the uterine arteries is associated with extremely low chances&#xD;
      of pregnancy when it is high, especially higher than 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pilot study of women with premature ovarian failure with uterine PIs greater than 3 showed&#xD;
      the efficiency of nifedipine in uterine vascularization. This calcium channel blocker, used&#xD;
      sublingually in this study, significantly lowered uterine PI in nearly half an hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are therefore interested in exploring this accessible, non-invasive and inexpensive tool,&#xD;
      in the evaluation of endometrial receptivity before an embryo transfer.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Embryo implantation is a key stage that depends on two main factors: embryo grading quality&#xD;
      and endometrial receptivity. Numerous tools have been suggested to evaluate these two&#xD;
      factors, without making it possible to predict with certainty the outcome of an embryo&#xD;
      transfer in terms of pregnancy. However, some diagnostic tests have shown a good negative&#xD;
      predictive value: it is the case of the measurement of the pulsatility index (PI) of the&#xD;
      uterine arteries which is associated with extremely low chances of pregnancy when it is high,&#xD;
      especially higher than 3(Cacciatore et al., 1996; Steer et al., 1992).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Pulsatility Index PI is calculated by the ratio between the maximum amplitude of the&#xD;
      tracing and the mean velocity. It evolves according to downstream resistance. Uterine&#xD;
      hypoperfusion would readily be associated with subfertility (Goswamy et al., 1988). The&#xD;
      uterine arterial pulsatility index is easily accessible during pelvic ultrasound, with&#xD;
      satisfactory intra- and inter-observer reproducibility (Steer et al., 1995). There is no&#xD;
      significant difference between the measurement of the right and left uterine PI (Favre et&#xD;
      al., 1993). Uterine PIs vary during the menstrual cycle (Goswamy and Steptoe, 1988) and&#xD;
      depending on hormonal effects (de Ziegler et al., 1991; Strigini et al., 1995) or ovarian&#xD;
      micropolycystic status (PCOS, syndrome of polycystic ovaries) of the patient (Resende et al.,&#xD;
      2001). The impact of tobacco (Battaglia et al., 2011) and parity (Guedes-Martins et al.,&#xD;
      2015) on uterine PIs is described in the literature. Age, although controversial, does not&#xD;
      seem to have an impact on uterine PIs, at least in premenopausal women case (Check et al.,&#xD;
      2000). Likewise, body mass index (BMI) could have an impact on PIs, as in increased PIs in&#xD;
      obese women (Battaglia et al., 1996; Zeng et al., 2013) If high uterine PIs are associated&#xD;
      with reduced chances of pregnancy, how can they be improved? A pilot study of women with&#xD;
      premature ovarian failure with uterine PIs greater than 3 showed the efficiency of nifedipine&#xD;
      in uterine vascularization. This calcium channel blocker, used sublingually in this study,&#xD;
      significantly lowered uterine PI in nearly half an hour (Huissoud et al., 2004) This&#xD;
      medication could therefore be promising in the treatment of patients in assisted medical&#xD;
      reproduction (ART) for whom the measurements of uterine PIs would be greater than 3 and&#xD;
      therefore have lower chances of pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to investigate weither the use of a calcium channel blocker (amlodipine)&#xD;
      improves the value of uterine PIs in patients with a uterine PI greater than 3, during a&#xD;
      cycle for frozen embryo transfer (FET).&#xD;
