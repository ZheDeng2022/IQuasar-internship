  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In daily life,people protect their tissues against ischemia by constantly changing positions.&#xD;
      In situations that cause unconsciousness such as anesthesia,people cannot react to the stress&#xD;
      or pressure due to immobility.This prolongation of immobility can lead to reversible or&#xD;
      irreversible damage to the tissues.Therefore,not careful positioning in patients undergoing&#xD;
      surgery can lead to serious complications.Peripheral nerve disorders are common in clinical&#xD;
      practice.Electrodiagnostic studies continue to be the gold standard for the evaluation of&#xD;
      nerve disorders.Elastography is a technique that measures the elastic properties of tissues&#xD;
      as a new ultrasonography technology.Given the histological changes in diseased peripheral&#xD;
      nerves, nerve elastography has begun to be studied as a noninvasive way to evaluate changes&#xD;
      in nerve tissue composition.Elastography of the peripheral nerves has rarely been studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary aim in this study is to compare the elastography values of the brachial plexus in&#xD;
      different arm and head positions and to contribute to elucidating the mechanism of nerve&#xD;
      damage due to position.American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) I-II volunteers between&#xD;
      the ages of 18-65 will be recruited to the study.The bilateral brachial plexus of each&#xD;
      volunteer will be examined.Participants with upper extremity or cervical trauma, muscle&#xD;
      weakness,cervical disc herniation or a history of spine or cranial surgery, neuromuscular&#xD;
      disease, clinical diagnosis of brachial plexopathies, hyperlipidemia,diabetes mellitus or&#xD;
      radiotherapy history in the cervical region,body mass index&gt; 35 will not be taken.Before the&#xD;
      procedure, the muscle strength of the upper extremity and cervical muscles will be examined&#xD;
      and volunteers with muscle weakness will be excluded from the study.Measurements will be made&#xD;
      together by two researchers who have at least 5 years of experience in&#xD;
      ultrasonography.Measurements will be made in 3 different positions.When the arm and head are&#xD;
      in neutral position, the head is turned to the opposite side and the head is turned to the&#xD;
      opposite side, the brachial plexus in the supraclavicular region will be visualized by&#xD;
      ultrasonography while the arm is in hyperabduction.The area between the upper boundary and&#xD;
      the lower boundary of the plexus will be marked, and the values will be taken 5 times&#xD;
      consecutively with the share wave elastography method and the elastic modulus,shear wave&#xD;
      velocity will be recorded.&#xD;
