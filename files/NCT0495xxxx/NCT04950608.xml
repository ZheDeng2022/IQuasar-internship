  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to develop and pilot test a novel regimen of&#xD;
      psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy for demoralization in patients receiving hospice care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -The name of the study drug involved in this study is Psilocybin&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to understand how psilocybin-assisted therapy may be adapted&#xD;
      in the context of hospice care, in order to test its safety in people with terminal illness&#xD;
      who experience demoralization, and to study how well it works to lessen symptoms of&#xD;
      psychological and existential distress.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This research study involves a combined drug and psychotherapeutic (talk therapy)&#xD;
           intervention. The research study procedures include screening for eligibility, and study&#xD;
           intervention including preparation, evaluations, one psilocybin session and follow up&#xD;
           visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The treatment regimen consists of a single administration of psilocybin with a&#xD;
                supportive psychotherapy including 2 preparation sessions and 2 integration&#xD;
                sessions&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The name of the study drug involved in this study is Psilocybin. Psilocybin is a&#xD;
                naturally occurring psychedelic drug produced by more than 200 species of&#xD;
                mushrooms, which is manufactured for medical use to control potency and purity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be followed for up to 24 weeks (approximately 6 months) after the&#xD;
           study treatment. It is expected that about 15 people will take part in this research&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This research study is a Feasibility Study, which mean it is the first time&#xD;
           investigators are examining psilocybin-assisted therapy in the context of hospice care.&#xD;
           Psilocybin is an &quot;Investigational&quot; drug, meaning that the study drug has not been&#xD;
           approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a treatment for any disease.&#xD;
           However, the FDA has granted psilocybin the status of &quot;breakthrough therapy&quot; in the&#xD;
           treatment of depression and the investigators have permission from the FDA to use this&#xD;
           drug in this research study.&#xD;

    <measure>Safety Outcomes: Suicidal Risk as assessed by Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From enrollement up to 10 days after dosing session</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of suicidal ideations or plans. The measurement of suicidal ideation is based on five &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; questions with accompanying descriptions arranged in order of increasing severity. If the patient answers &quot;yes&quot; to either questions 1 or 2, the intensity of ideation is assessed in five additional questions related to frequency, duration, controllability, deterrents, and reasons for the most severe suicidal ideation. Suicidal behavior is assessed by asking questions categorizing behaviors into actual, aborted, and interrupted attempts; preparatory behavior; and non-suicidal self-injurious behavior. A significant suicide risk is defined by suicidal ideation with intend and a plan as endorsed on item 5 on the C-SSRS within the past month at V0 or since previous visit later during the study.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Any terminal illness with respect of exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Palliative Performance Scale (PPS) ≥ 50 % (see Appendix A)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Moderate-to-severe demoralization as measured by Demoralization Scale-II ≥ 8&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant other or other caregiver present at home the night of study drug&#xD;
             administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No driving for 24 hours following study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Psilocybin is very likely to have no genotoxic effects. One study that directly&#xD;
             focused on the mutagenic potential of psilocybin did not found this type of toxicity.&#xD;
             However, due to the lack of clinical and non-clinical studies on the effects of&#xD;
             psilocybin on the developing human fetus, women and men of child-bearing potential and&#xD;
             who are sexually active must agree to use an acceptable contraceptive method (hormonal&#xD;
             or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) throughout their participation in the&#xD;
             study. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her&#xD;
             partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician&#xD;
             immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 4&#xD;
             months after completion of psilocybin administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current General Inpatient (GIP) hospice status&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients currently receiving chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Condition impairing oral intake or digestive absorption&#xD;

          -  Significant suicide risk as defined by suicidal ideation with intend and a plan as&#xD;
             endorsed on item 5 on the C-SSRS within the past month or at V0&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current or past history of schizophrenia, psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder,&#xD;
             delusional disorder, paranoid personality disorder, schizoaffective disorder, or&#xD;
             borderline personality disorder, as assessed by medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with first-degree relatives with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to psilocybin&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other personal circumstances and behavior that would limit compliance with study&#xD;
             requirements, or judged by the study psychiatrist and/or principal investigator to be&#xD;
             incompatible with establishment of rapport or safe exposure to psilocybin&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Potential for adverse drug-drug interactions. Concomitant medications with significant&#xD;
             potential to interact with study medications will be exclusionary if they cannot be&#xD;
             tapered. These include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serotoninergic antidepressants&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Centrally-acting serotonergic agents (e.g. MAO inhibitors)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Antipsychotics (e.g. first and second generation)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Mood stabilizers (e.g. lithium, valproic acid)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitors (e.g. disulfiram)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Significant inhibitors of UGT 1A0 or UGT 1A10&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any psychiatric medication will be tapered if possible in an appropriate fashion to&#xD;
             avoid withdrawal effects. They will be discontinued long enough before the psilocybin&#xD;
             Session to avoid the possibility of any drug-drug interaction (the interval will be at&#xD;
             least five times the particular drug and active metabolites' half-life).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  End stage liver disease or cirrhosis as primary hospice diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have elevated AST and ALT five times above the normal laboratory limit on&#xD;

             including confusion, asterixis or jaundice.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other clinically significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, hepatic,&#xD;
             renal condition or any other unstable condition that, in the opinion of the principal&#xD;
             investigator, may interfere with the interpretation of the study results or constitute&#xD;
             a health risk for the participant if he/she takes part in the study. This may include&#xD;
             but is not limited to clinical symptoms or recent history of significant&#xD;
             tachyarrhythmias; severe angina or myocardial ischemia; poorly controlled congestive&#xD;
             heart failure; poorly controlled hypertension; poorly controlled hypo- or&#xD;
             hyperthyroidism; uncontrolled diabetes; severe renal or liver disfunction; acute&#xD;
             respiratory failure; sepsis; history of cerebral aneurysms; glaucoma; increased&#xD;
             intracranial pressure and any intracranial mass.&#xD;
