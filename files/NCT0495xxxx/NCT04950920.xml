      At present, the treatment of acute ischemic stroke includes intravenous thrombolysis,&#xD;
      intravascular interventional therapy (including arterial thrombolysis, mechanical&#xD;
      thrombectomy, angioplasty and stent implantation), antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulant&#xD;
      therapy, defibrasion therapy, volume expansion therapy, and neuroprotective therapy. Y-2&#xD;
      sublingual tablet is an innovative drug developed by Yantai yinuoyi Biomedical Technology&#xD;
      Co., Ltd. with independent intellectual property rights. This product is a free radical&#xD;
      scavenger and inflammatory protein expression inhibitor. It can clear hydroxyl free radical&#xD;
      (COH), nitric oxide free radical (no) and peroxynitrite ion (onoa), and inhibit the&#xD;
      expression of tumor necrosis factor-A (TNF-a), interleukin IP (IL-1 (3), cyclooxygenase-2&#xD;
      (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and other inflammatory related proteins&#xD;
      induced by cerebral ischemia. By clearing the excessive free radicals produced in the brain&#xD;
      tissue during ischemia and reperfusion and inhibiting the secondary inflammatory reaction, we&#xD;
      can reduce the damage of free radicals and inflammatory reaction to the brain tissue, block&#xD;
      the pathological change process caused by cerebral ischemia from two ways, and play a&#xD;
      synergistic therapeutic role in cerebral ischemia injury.&#xD;
