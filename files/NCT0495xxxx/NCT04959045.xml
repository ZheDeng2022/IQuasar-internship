  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, it was aimed to determine the effect of the Flipped Classroom Teaching Method&#xD;
      on the academic achievement and skill learning levels of nursing students in nursing skills&#xD;
      education.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to the rapid changes in science and technology, the increase in the number of students in&#xD;
      higher education and the decrease in resources, the fact that students are in the Y and Z&#xD;
      generation, who know the use of technology well, have advanced thinking and a rapid knowledge&#xD;
      acquisition process, they are different from traditional teaching methods due to the Covid 19&#xD;
      pandemic. The use of teaching methods has become more important. In nursing education, the&#xD;
      curriculum should support high-level learning, encourage active learning, education should be&#xD;
      student-centered, and students should take responsibility for learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The traditional classroom model learning approaches, in which the student is a passive&#xD;
      participant and under the control of the teacher, have been changing recently with the effect&#xD;
      of new educational technologies, learner characteristics and learning expectations, and&#xD;
      methods in which students are more active are needed. This change reveals structuring in the&#xD;
      direction of the use of out-of-class time. One of these embodiments is the flipped classroom&#xD;
      model. Presenting in-class activities to students outside the classroom in flipped classrooms&#xD;
      is defined as bringing homework and activities that are expected to be done outside the&#xD;
      classroom in the traditional structure. In the flipped learning model, the student reaches&#xD;
      the basic level of knowledge outside the classroom, and spends the classroom time with&#xD;
      high-level skills such as discussion, practice and problem solving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, it was aimed to determine the effect of the Flipped Classroom Teaching Method&#xD;
      on the success of the students and the level of skill learning in skill education, which has&#xD;
      an important place in nursing education. With the Flipped learning method, it is aimed to&#xD;
      raise individuals who are student-centered, who research and question what has been learned,&#xD;
      learn by doing and experiencing, and internalize and make sense of the information they have&#xD;
      learned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the studies showing the results of the teaching practice related to flipped learning&#xD;
      in the literature are generally positive, they cannot provide definite data in terms of its&#xD;
      effect on student success. In addition, there is a limited number of studies on nursing&#xD;
      skills teaching related to the Flipped Learning method. In our country, there is no teaching&#xD;
      example related to flipped learning in nursing education. However, the requirements and&#xD;
      conditions include investigating the application and use of new models such as flipped&#xD;
      learning; It was decided to carry out this research because it requires the collection of&#xD;
      data on whether the application of this learning method is appropriate in nursing education&#xD;
      at the universal and national level, especially in nursing skills training.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This research is a randomized controlled experimental study. It was planned to divide the students into two groups as experimental and control groups. Simple random sampling method will be used to determine the experimental and control groups. To ensure randomization, each student will be numbered and data sets (experiment and control) will be created.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Students will be given skill training with the Flipped Teaching method, which consists of outside and in-class applications.&#xD;
Out-of-Class Practice: A Learning Management System-Web-Based Distance Education System will be created for the Flipped Teaching method. Theoretical course topics and skill training videos will be uploaded to the system 7 days before the course day. Students will be able to watch the video tutorials in the number and frequency they want until the day of the lesson. At the end of the lesson, the mini-exam will be uploaded to the system.&#xD;
In-class practice: The researcher will come to the lesson prepared for classroom activities such as &quot;question and answer&quot;. Theoretical lectures and skill demonstrations will not be made by the researcher. The researcher will only guide the students. Then, the students will be provided to perform the skill under the guidance of the researcher in the clinical skills laboratory.</description>
