      Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a kind of serious neurologic damage caused by violence to the&#xD;
      spinal cord, resulting in various functions of the body below the injury level, including&#xD;
      motor, sensory, sphincter, and reflex dysfunction in varying degrees, usually resulting in&#xD;
      permanent and irreversible functional loss or paralysis of patients. The treatment of SCI is&#xD;
      an essential problem in the world. In the past decades, experimental research on SCI involves&#xD;
      genes, proteins, cells, and tissues, and has made great progress. However, these studies&#xD;
      mainly focus on the SCI at the early stage, rather than the later stage. The reason is that&#xD;
      in the later stage, scar formed by glial cells and fibroblasts in the injured area is a&#xD;
      physical and chemical barrier, which inhibits the regeneration and myelination of nerve axons&#xD;
      and results in inhibiting spinal cord repairment. Therefore, before the treatment of chronic&#xD;
      SCI, the key problem is to distinguish glial scar tissue from normal tissue and eliminate its&#xD;
      influence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As glial scar inhibits axon regeneration, eliminating glial scar is necessary for the repair&#xD;
      of the injured spinal cord. In recent years, a large number of experimental studies have been&#xD;
      carried out to destroy the process of glial scar formation after SCI by enzyme digestion and&#xD;
      antibody. Though these methods reduced glial scar, residual glial scars were reported in&#xD;
      animal experiments. Compared to biochemical methods, surgical resection of glial scar tissue&#xD;
      is a relatively simple and effective method to eliminate glial scars. Due to the limited&#xD;
      regeneration ability of nerves after SCI, it is important to identify scar tissue accurately&#xD;
      before operations to avoid surgical injury to normal tissue, which is also the premise of&#xD;
      further research and clinical application of various interventional treatment methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the most commonly used non-invasive imaging&#xD;
      techniques to evaluate the degree of injury and therapeutic effect of SCI. Nemours MRI&#xD;
      studies on SCI show the impact of SCI on the central nervous system from the structural and&#xD;
      functional level and prove the potential application value of MRI in assisting doctors in the&#xD;
      diagnosis of SCI. A small number of previous studies have used magnetization transfer&#xD;
      imaging, and diffusion tensor imaging to detect glial scar tissue, showing the potential&#xD;
      application value of these images in differentiation between glial scar and surrounding&#xD;
      normal spinal cord. However, because glial cells, which constitute glial scar, are also&#xD;
      important components of normal spinal cord tissue, previous studies only identified glial&#xD;
      scar from a single aspect, such as tissue type, macromolecular component, or water molecular&#xD;
      diffusion strength. Therefore, their specificities were unsatisfactory. Relative methods were&#xD;
      unable to identify glial scar accurately and finally resulted in difficulty in treatment&#xD;
      arrangement and evaluation of prognosis, which hinders the development of SCI treatment&#xD;
      research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combing multimodal MRI, including conventional MRI and diffusion MRI, with supervised machine&#xD;
      learning makes accurate glial identification in chronic SCI possible. multimodal MRI can&#xD;
      depict the differences between scar tissue and non-scar tissue from the aspects of cell&#xD;
      composition, water molecular dispersion, structural complexity, etc. Comparing to MRI with a&#xD;
      single model, multimodal MRI provides more specific features. Machine learning, a way to&#xD;
      construct robust and accurate models, can mine the quantitative relationship between imaging&#xD;
      features and clinical diagnosis results, reveal MRI feature markers of the glial scar, to&#xD;
      improve the accuracy of identification. The research work, combined with medicine, imaging,&#xD;
      and artificial intelligence technology, is expected to solve the problem of accurate and&#xD;
      non-invasive identification of glial scar in chronic SCI, which has potential application&#xD;
      value for laboratory research and clinical treatment of chronic SCI.&#xD;
