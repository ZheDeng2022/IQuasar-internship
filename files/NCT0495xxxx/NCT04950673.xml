  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare the impact of the coronavirus disease (SARS-CoV-2,&#xD;
      or COVID-19) on cognitive function in the population of patients who have been diagnosed,&#xD;
      treated and recovered from the COVID-19 infection versus patients who have not been infected.&#xD;
      Primary endpoint is to evaluate the percentage of cognitive decline observed in both study&#xD;
      arms (subjects with or without COVID-19 history) using assessments of Cognivue Clarity, MMSE&#xD;
      and MoCA. Secondary endpoint is to see the correlation of Depression and anxiety scales&#xD;
      (i.e., Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and/or Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS)) and&#xD;
      Cognivue scores while comparing the trend of difference between both study arms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognivue is an FDA-cleared cognitive assessment device based on modern cognitive&#xD;
      neuroscience, that allows physicians, allied healthcare providers, and patients to access a&#xD;
      new approach to brain health, moving beyond the old questions and answers approach of&#xD;
      traditional cognitive tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognivue's development and testing is based on 20 years of psychophysical and&#xD;
      neurophysiological research that has focused on the early detection of patients' cognitive&#xD;
      decline. Its FDA clearance study demonstrated significant correlation to the SLUMS and other&#xD;
      neuropsychological tests, superior test re-test reliability compared to SLUMS, and validated&#xD;
      its psychometric properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Historically, physicians have used the Mini-Mental Status Exam (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive&#xD;
      Assessment (MoCA) to assess cognitive functioning. These tools are often limited by issues of&#xD;
      bias, inconsistent retest reliability, staffing and cost. The automated Cognivue technology&#xD;
      utilizes adaptive psychophysics and assesses the patient's motor skills and visual acuity,&#xD;
      eliminating the bias found in common cognitive testing mechanisms such as MMSE, MoCA, and&#xD;
      Mini-Cog.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using Cognivue Clarity, we have an opportunity to better understand a person in total when we&#xD;
      insist that cognitive function testing is part of the recovery plan for individuals who&#xD;
      experience the whiplash of COVID-19, either directly or indirectly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multi-site, open-label study. Approximately 1000 subjects will be enrolled. Up to&#xD;
      500 subjects with COVID-19 history and 500 subjects without a COVID-19 diagnosis will be&#xD;
      enrolled in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first visit, all subjects will be provided with an informed consent form (ICF) to&#xD;
      review and sign prior to starting any study-specific procedures. Subjects will be asked about&#xD;
      their COVID-19 diagnosis history, prior to study enrollment. After informed consent is&#xD;
      obtained from subjects, study staff will review contact, demographic and medical history&#xD;
      information. Following this review, cognitive testing using Cognivue Clarity, MMSE and MOCA&#xD;
      will occur. In addition, subjects will take the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and/or&#xD;
      Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) during this visit .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be followed for 24 months in the study, coming to the study site to review&#xD;
      COVID-19 infection (re-infection or newly diagnosed) as well as perform cognitive testing&#xD;
      with Cognivue Clarity, MMSE and MOCA. Subjects will also take the PHQ-9 and/or GDS during&#xD;
      these visits. In addition, during the 12- and 24-month visits, study staff will review&#xD;
      previously reported medical history information with subjects to determine any new&#xD;
      information.&#xD;
