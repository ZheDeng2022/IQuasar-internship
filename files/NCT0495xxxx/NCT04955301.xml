      This study aims to test and compare the effectiveness of three priming interventions on&#xD;
      consumers' selection of sustainable foods: priming with environmental benefits, health&#xD;
      benefits and co-benefits (environment and health benefits).&#xD;

    <description>The priming manipulation will be embedded in one discrete choice experiment to test the effect of three priming interventions: priming with health benefits, environment benefits, and co-benefits of having sustainable diets, respectively, on consumers' preference for sustainable foods, and the relative importance of proximal attributes (e.g. taste and price) and distant attributes (e.g., attributes related to environmental sustainability) in determining food choice preference, as well as testing whether the effects of these three priming interventions can be modified by consumers' social orientation values. The cueing manipulation will be achieved by asking participants to complete a word-search exercise.</description>
