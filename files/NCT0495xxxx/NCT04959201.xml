  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies found that some NMDA-enhancing agents were able to improve clinical symptoms&#xD;
      of patients with schizophrenia. In addition, several drugs with antioxidant properties have&#xD;
      been tested in clinical trials for the treatment of schizophrenia too. Whether combined&#xD;
      treatment of an NMDA-enhancing agent and a drug with antioxidant property can be better than&#xD;
      an NMDA-enhancing agent alone deserves study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several lines of evidence suggest that both NMDA and oxidative stress hypotheses have been&#xD;
      implicated in schizophrenia. Previous studies found that some NMDA-enhancing agents were able&#xD;
      to augment efficacy of antipsychotics in the treatment of schizophrenia. In addition, several&#xD;
      drugs with antioxidant properties have been tested in clinical trials for the treatment of&#xD;
      schizophrenia too. Whether a drug with antioxidant property can strengthen the efficacy of an&#xD;
      NMDA-enhancer (NMDAE) in the treatment of schizophrenia remains unknown. Therefore, this&#xD;
      study aims to compare NMDAE plus a drug with antioxidant property and NMDAE plus placebo in&#xD;
      the treatment of schizophrenia. The subjects are the schizophrenia patients who remain&#xD;
      symptomatic while having been stabilized with antipsychotic treatment. They keep their&#xD;
      original treatment and are randomly, double-blindly assigned into two treatment groups for 12&#xD;
      weeks: (1) NMDAE plus Antioxidant agent (AO), or (2) NMDAE plus placebo. Clinical&#xD;
      performances and side effects are measured at weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12. Cognitive&#xD;
      functions are assessed at baseline and at endpoint of treatment by a battery of tests. The&#xD;
      efficacies of NMDAE plus AO and NMDAE plus placebo will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chi-square (or Fisher's exact test) will be used to compare differences of categorical&#xD;
      variables and t-test (or Mann-Whitney test if the distribution is not normal) for continuous&#xD;
      variables between treatment groups. Mean changes from baseline in repeated-measure&#xD;
      assessments will be assessed using the generalized estimating equation (GEE). All p values&#xD;
      for clinical measures will be based on two-tailed tests with a significance level of 0.05.&#xD;

    <description>Ten tests for assessment of 7 cognitive domains:&#xD;
speed of processing (assessed by Category Fluency, Trail Marking A, WAIS-III Digit Symbol-Coding)&#xD;
sustained attention (Continuous Performance Test)&#xD;
working memory: verbal (digit span) and nonverbal (spatial span)&#xD;
verbal learning and memory (WMS-III, word listing)&#xD;
visual learning and memory (WMS-III, visual reproduction)&#xD;
reasoning and problem solving (WISC-III, Maze)&#xD;
social cognition (MSCEIT Version 2)&#xD;
All tests have no unit. Firstly, for the domain (a. and c.) with more than one test, a composite T score will be calculated by standardizing the average of each T score (with a mean of 50 and a SD of 10 for making every test comparative). Secondly, a global composite score (for all seven domains) and a neurocognitive composite score (for the first 6 domains, a-f) will be also calculated by standardizing the average of the T score of each domain (Lane HY et al, JAMA Psychiatry. 2013).</description>
