      To investigate the reliability of VAN tool as administered by Emergency Medical Services&#xD;

      The investigators propose to perform a 6-month pilot study in Northwest Arkansas in&#xD;
      collaboration of two EMS providers; Central EMS and AirEvac. These local providers operate in&#xD;
      the WRMC catchment area and transport over 90% of patients with a suspected stroke to WRMC&#xD;
      comprehensive stroke center. Thus no changes to their standard operations would be&#xD;
      implemented. The aim of this pilot study would be to test the accuracy of VAN-screening in&#xD;
      the area in patients treated at WRMC - thus only patients who are brought to WRMC as per&#xD;
      current protocol would be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators would train Central EMS and AirEvac personnel to perform the V.A.N screen,&#xD;
      over a 2-month period (estimated June-July 2020) in several sessions at the Central EMS&#xD;
      training center at 800 S. School Ave. in Fayetteville. This training would be performed by&#xD;
      study investigators, assisted by medical students, residents, and advanced practice nurses&#xD;
      (APNs). The training would consist of a training video, hands-on instruction, and sample&#xD;
      scenarios.The investigators would survey all training participants to gather feedback on the&#xD;
      format, delivery, and understanding of the training material. The PowerPoint presentation&#xD;
      planned for the training session, as well as the post-training quiz, are attached as&#xD;
      Appendices to this application. The investigators would expect a rate of 80% correct answers&#xD;
      in the post-training quiz. All questions and scenarios would be discussed with all trainees&#xD;
      after the quiz, and re-takes would be allowed.&#xD;
