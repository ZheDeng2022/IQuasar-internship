      This study seeks to develop a comprehensive machine/statistical learning model capable of&#xD;
      predicting the risk of child bicyclist/pedestrian-MVCs and active transportation prevalence&#xD;
      at the community level, based on the built environment features within various Canadian&#xD;
      municipalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will construct a geodatabase to be used to train and test multiple machine&#xD;
      learning models(1). Given that child Motor-Vehicle Collisions (MVCs) do not occur randomly,&#xD;
      but like other diseases are distributed according to the influencing characteristics, these&#xD;
      models may be capable of establishing associations between the built environment, child&#xD;
      active transportation prevalence, and child injury risk and fatality in specific Canadian&#xD;
      municipalities.&#xD;

      Background Motor-vehicle collisions (MVCs) are a leading cause of Canadian child pedestrian/&#xD;
      bicyclist injuries. Fears of MVCs can further reduce active transportation prevalence, and&#xD;
      the accompanying health benefits. Built environment features (e.g., curb extensions) may&#xD;
      reduce child injury risk at specific locations; however, it is important to understand how&#xD;
      these features can impact community wide child active transportation safety outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective This study seeks to develop a comprehensive machine/statistical learning model&#xD;
      capable of predicting the risk of child bicyclist/pedestrian-MVCs and active transportation&#xD;
      prevalence at the community level, based on the built environment features within various&#xD;
      Canadian municipalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design Investigators will construct a geodatabase to be used to train and test multiple&#xD;
      machine learning models(1). Given that child Motor-Vehicle Collisions (MVCs) do not occur&#xD;
      randomly, but like other diseases are distributed according to the influencing&#xD;
      characteristics, these models may be capable of establishing associations between the built&#xD;
      environment, child active transportation prevalence, and child injury risk and fatality in&#xD;
      specific Canadian municipalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Data for this project has been obtained through the CHild Active-Transportation Safety&#xD;
      and the Environment (CHASE) program(2). Using geographic information system (GIS)(3,4)&#xD;
      software (i.e., ArcGIS), CHASE data and its accompanying spatial characteristics have been&#xD;
      consolidated into a comprehensive geodatabase allowing for managing and storing spatially&#xD;
      characterized data. This database contains over 300 variables and over 200 layers of interest&#xD;
      characterized by the 3Ds of the built environment(5). This includes density (e.g., population&#xD;
      demographics, city boundaries, age, social economic status), diversity (e.g., school&#xD;
      attendance, student bussing numbers, crossing guards, housing land use, parks), and design&#xD;
      features (e.g., built environment features, road network, traffic calming, bicycle&#xD;
      infrastructure, traffic volume/speed). This database also includes child active&#xD;
      transportation (e.g., mode share, prevalence), and injury (e.g., MVC locations, police&#xD;
      collision reports) outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These data have been obtained by the CHASE team from national, provincial, and municipal&#xD;
      sources, including Alberta Transportation, Stats Canada, the Toronto District School Board,&#xD;
      the City of Calgary, Eco-Counter, and specific CHASE projects(2). CHASE projects included&#xD;
      in-person audits of the built environment surrounding elementary schools, direct observation&#xD;
      of elementary students/parents mode of transportation to school, quasi-experimental studies&#xD;
      of specific built environment interventions, and comparisons of the built environment between&#xD;
      locations of a child bicyclist injury and control locations. Both this project and the CHASE&#xD;
      program focuses on the municipalities of Vancouver, Surrey, Calgary, Toronto, Peel, Montreal,&#xD;
      and Laval; with data collected for each year between 2010 and 2020. As such, the database&#xD;
      used in this study will contain over 8,000 child (age 1-17) bicyclist and pedestrian&#xD;
      injuries, and active transportation prevalence at over 500 elementary schools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Model Development When investigating traffic safety, many different machine learning models&#xD;
      can be used including Bayesian neural networks, support vector machines, random forests, and&#xD;
      nearest neighbour classification(6 -9). To ensure reproducibility of results(1), this study&#xD;
      will test and compare multiple supervised machine learning algorithms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After preparing the CHASE geodatabase, the data will be split into training and evaluation&#xD;
      sets. The training set will include a random sample of 80% of the data from each&#xD;
      municipality, with the remainder used in the evaluation set. Splitting the data by&#xD;
      municipality rather than the entire dataset, ensures that the final model can be tested&#xD;
      against the widest range of urban designs possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially, all available variables will be used in developing the model. To ensure a&#xD;
      parsimonious model, various strategies (e.g., backward elimination, Bayesian Information&#xD;
      Criterion) will be used to retain only those variables that have an influence on the outcome,&#xD;
      or those that may have a confounding effect on other important variables(10). Evaluations of&#xD;
      collinearity of similar predictor variables will also be conducted throughout development&#xD;
      (e.g., Principle Component Analysis), with subsequent adjustment of models. During training,&#xD;
      k-fold cross-validation will be used for resampling the training data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes Child pedestrian/bicyclist injury and active transportation outcomes, along with&#xD;
      their predictor variables, will be analyzed according to community boundary buffer zones&#xD;
      within each municipality. This will allow investigation into the density of specific built&#xD;
      environment features per community boundary, and its effect on child active transportation&#xD;
      injury risk and active transportation prevalence. Comparison of the accuracy of the various&#xD;
      algorithms will lead to a chosen model able to determine whether specific covariates increase&#xD;
      or decrease child pedestrian/bicyclist injury risk or active transportation prevalence.&#xD;
