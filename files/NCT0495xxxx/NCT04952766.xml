  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary endpoint of this study is to compare the humoral response (titre and neutralizing&#xD;
      capacity of induced antibodies) against SARS-CoV-2 following vaccination with BNT162b2&#xD;
      (Pfizer BioNTech) in immunocompromised persons, in comparison to healthy subject. Secondary&#xD;
      objectives are to evaluate the humoral response in the nasal mucosa, and the capacity of&#xD;
      antibodies to neutralize emerging variants of concerns and to prevent COVID-19.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The serious, even fatal, forms of COVID-19 preferentially affect elderly and fragile&#xD;
      subjects. Among these populations at risk, people who are immunocompromised (either by a&#xD;
      disease and / or its treatment) have a theoretical risk of responding less well to a&#xD;
      preventive vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study aims to compare the vaccine response of immunocompromised&#xD;
      people with healthy subjects (non-immunocompromised), i.e. to assess the serum humoral&#xD;
      response (titre and neutralizing capacity of the antibodies induced) following vaccination&#xD;
      with ComirnatyTM (i.e. BNT162b2, an anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine from Pfizer BioNTech) in&#xD;
      immunocompromised persons in comparison to healthy subjects (non-immunocompromised).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the antibody response in the nasal mucosa (titre and neutralizing capacity&#xD;
           of the antibodies induced, collected by means of a nasopharyngeal swab) following&#xD;
           vaccination with ComirnatyTM in immunocompromised people as compared to healthy subjects&#xD;
           (vaccinated either with two doses of ComirnatyTM or, in a subgroup, with one dose of&#xD;
           Astra Zeneca's VaxzeriaTM followed by one dose of ComirnatyTM).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the serum and mucosal antibody response (titre and neutralizing capacity of the&#xD;
           antibodies induced) against emerging strains of SARS-CoV-2 (so-called Alpha, Beta,&#xD;
           Gamma, Delta strains).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the post-vaccination clinical protection against the risk of COVID-19 infection&#xD;
           (incident cases after vaccination).&#xD;
