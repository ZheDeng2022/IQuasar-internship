  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dietary fiber is well-known for its many health benefits, including the support of&#xD;
      gastrointestinal, metabolic, and mental health. Although studies investigating whole dietary&#xD;
      patterns in relation to cognition have demonstrated that diet quality and a healthy dietary&#xD;
      pattern are associated with better cognitive performance, the role of dietary fiber in this&#xD;
      regard is understudied. In the last decade, the role of the microbiota (trillions of microbes&#xD;
      inhabiting the gut) in influencing various aspects of human health, including mental health&#xD;
      and behavior, has also become established. Importantly, dietary fiber has been shown to&#xD;
      positively affect the microbiota composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the role of dietary fiber in cognition through the lens of the microbiota is&#xD;
      investigated. A two-part study including an observational (study 1) and interventional (study&#xD;
      2) arm has been designed. In study 1, the observational arm, 150 healthy individuals (30-60&#xD;
      years of age) will be recruited and grouped into high-fiber (&gt;25 g/day, n=75) and low-fiber&#xD;
      (&lt;18 grams/day, n=75) consumers based on habitual dietary intake. Cognitive tasks (attention,&#xD;
      episodic memory, decision making), psychological dimensions including impulsivity and&#xD;
      emotional reactivity, biological samples (feces, blood, saliva, urine) and questionnaires&#xD;
      about general health will be collected. In study 2, the interventional arm, a subgroup (n=60)&#xD;
      of individuals from the low-fiber group will further be randomized into an 8-week&#xD;
      randomized-controlled, parallel, single-blinded intervention to either receive a high fiber&#xD;
      (n=30, aim 30 grams/day) or control (n=30) diet education. During the intervention period,&#xD;
      individuals will provide repeated fecal samples in order to assess temporal microbial&#xD;
      changes. At the end of the intervention period, individuals will undergo the same testing&#xD;
      regarding cognitive and psychological variables and the same biological samples will be&#xD;
      collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that participants with higher dietary fiber intake at baseline&#xD;
      will perform better in the cognitive tasks compared to individuals with low fiber intake, and&#xD;
      that this difference can, in part, be mediated by the gut microbiota. Further the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that through the dietary intervention the microbiota composition&#xD;
      will positively shift to include more beneficial microbes and that cognitive performance will&#xD;
      improve following the intervention.&#xD;
