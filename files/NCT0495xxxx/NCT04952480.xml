  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects of using adaptive radiotherapy to&#xD;
      deliver chest radiation has on the ability to control lung cancer and side effects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be an open-label, single-arm, phase II study comparing dose escalated adaptive&#xD;
      thoracic radiotherapy to historical control of standard of care single planned radiotherapy&#xD;
      field for entire treatment course in patients with newly diagnosed limited stage small cell&#xD;
      lung cancer eligible for concurrent chemoradiation with platinum doublet based chemotherapy,&#xD;
      or extensive stage small cell lung cancer patients with radiation-targetable intra-thoracic&#xD;
      disease and none or limited extra-thoracic disease that are eligible for up-front platinum&#xD;
      doublet chemotherapy and are fit to receive concurrent radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The adaptive dose-escalated radiotherapy treatment plan will be delivered in three sequential&#xD;
      phases with two scheduled replans during the treatment along with scaled dose limits for&#xD;
      organs-at-risk. Up to 70 Gy in 35 fractions can be delivered to the disease without&#xD;
      overdosing organs-at-risk, and treatment will last 5 - 7 weeks. Scheduled CT simulations for&#xD;
      the replans will be at fraction 5 and fraction 10 to account for the expected rapidly&#xD;
      shrinking tumour volumes. Participants will be followed for 24 months to investigate local&#xD;
      failure rate, medium progression-free survival, overall survival, acute radiation toxicity,&#xD;
      and late radiation toxicity. Follow-up after the study will be as per standard-of-care for&#xD;
      secondary endpoints.&#xD;

    <description>Concurrent with standard of care platinum doublet based chemotherapy (cisplatin + etoposide), radiation treatment plan will be delivered in three sequential phases with two scheduled replans during the treatment along with scaled dose limits for organs-at-risk: Phase 1 dose prescription = 14 Gy in 7 fractions; Phase 2 dose prescription = 10 Gy in 5 fractions starting the day after the final (7th) fraction is delivered; Phase 3 dose prescription = either a) 70 Gy in 35 fractions, or if this cannot be safely reached without exceeding the dose limit of an organ-at-risk, b) the maximum safe prescribe-able dose tolerance specified in the protocol. Either 3D conformal radiotherapy or IMRT planning and delivery techniques will be employed, including contouring relevant thoracic organs-at-risk. All CT simulation scans will be without contrast.</description>
