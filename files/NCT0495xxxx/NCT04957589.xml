  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sarcopenia is defined as the incremental age-related loss of skeletal muscle in humans which&#xD;
      generally begins from forty years old. It is associated with an overall reduction in quality&#xD;
      of life and increased morbidity and mortality. Patients with type two diabetes mellitus&#xD;
      (T2DM) are particularly at risk of developing sarcopenia, partly due to the condition and&#xD;
      also due to the common incidence after or during middle age. A promising&#xD;
      recently-investigated and effective conservative approach to T2DM is through very low calorie&#xD;
      diets (VLCD). Some studies have shown that the diabetic status of some patients can be&#xD;
      reversed through VLCD. However, VLCD will theoretically result in an acceleration of&#xD;
      sarcopenia. This presents as a limiting factor for the implementation of VLCD in this at-risk&#xD;
      patient group. Skeletal muscle tissue is encouraged to grow in size or be maintained through&#xD;
      two means - an increase in circulating protein breakdown products, or through resistance&#xD;
      exercise (RE). Additionally, RE has been shown to increase the body's sensitivity to insulin,&#xD;
      the main hormone which controls circulating glucose levels and is frequently impaired in&#xD;
      T2DM, as well as temporarily decreasing glucose levels. The precise mechanism by which these&#xD;
      happen is not fully understood yet. In this study, the effect of one form of RE (high&#xD;
      intensity interval training, HIT) is used, with or without protein supplementation, in a VLCD&#xD;
      in overweight, middle-aged male patients with T2DM. 12 patients are to be recruited into each&#xD;
      group (interval training, resistance training, control) at our centre. Patient weight,&#xD;
      markers of muscle protein synthesis, glucose levels and changes to blood vessels will be&#xD;
      investigated before, during and after across a six week timeframe. Investigations will&#xD;
      include muscle and fat biopsies, blood samples, ultrasound scans, strength testing,&#xD;
      echocardiogram and deuterium oxide (D2O) isotope ingestion for later non-invasive body fluid&#xD;
      sample mass spectrometric analysis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Very low calorie diet (VLCD) is increasingly being utilized to improve cardio-metabolic&#xD;
      outcomes in overweight/obese individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), but concerns&#xD;
      regarding its association with skeletal muscle mass losses persist, especially in&#xD;
      middle-aged/older individuals, who are already at risk of accelerated sarcopenia. This is&#xD;
      particularly relevant in people at risk of developing diabetes due to the rising incidence&#xD;
      and prevalence of diabetes among older patients as well as accelerated sarcopenia in diabetes&#xD;
      compared with non-diabetes. Given that low skeletal muscle mass and function is linked to&#xD;
      mortality, frailty, and adverse cardio-metabolic outcomes, increased understanding of the&#xD;
      mechanisms of VLCD-induced muscle atrophy, and novel strategies to overcome this is crucial&#xD;
      to optimize healthy ageing. Alongside nutrition, physical activity is another key driver of&#xD;
      muscle protein synthesis, with habitual physical activity required to maintain muscle mass. A&#xD;
      number of studies have shown that even short-term muscle disuse (or reduced use in the form&#xD;
      of reduced ambulation (e.g. 2 weeks of &lt;1500 steps/day) or limb immobilization causes muscle&#xD;
      wasting. Exercise has also been shown to improve metabolic control by increasing muscle&#xD;
      glucose uptake during muscle contractions via insulin-independent mechanisms, and also by&#xD;
      increasing skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity following physical activity. HIT has been&#xD;
      shown in a number of studie to improve both cardiovascular and metabolic function in a&#xD;
      variety of cohorts. Furthermore, protein supplementation has been extensively studied in past&#xD;
      studies, with consistent outcomes with respect to the retention of muscle mass following&#xD;
      increased protein intake. Therefore, this study aims to quantitatively determine whether HIT&#xD;
      in isolation, or paired with protein supplementation, helps prevent a major physiological&#xD;
      detrimental effect of VLCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will randomise volunteers to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. VLCD (&quot;Lighter Life&quot; meal replacement product, total 600 calories (kcal)) alone (200kcal&#xD;
           free allowance) (N=12)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. VLCD and HIT (200kcal free allowance) (N=12)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. VLCD and HIT (200kcal protein supplementation) (N=12) This will be undertaken in&#xD;
           overweight and obese patients (BMI=27-50kg/m2) of male gender and between the ages of&#xD;
           35-65 years. Based on our previous work assessing microvascular perfusion in response to&#xD;
           feeding, a power calculation suggests that 10 per group would demonstrate&#xD;
           intervention-based changes in microvascular responses to feeding. The study will aim to&#xD;
           recruit (to allow for potential non-completion) 12 subjects per group. Volunteers would&#xD;
           undergo detailed physiological and metabolic investigations before and after&#xD;
           interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Skeletal muscle mass, function and protein metabolism 2) Vascular function (microvascular&#xD;
      perfusion, macrovascular blood flow and endothelial function) 3) Cardio-metabolic status&#xD;
      (glucose handling, cardiorespiratory function, central blood flow parameters) 4) mechanisms&#xD;
      regulating changes in glucose handling and muscle protein turnover It is anticipated that HIT&#xD;
      may ameliorate VLCD-induced reductions in skeletal muscle mass and function, by boosting the&#xD;
      molecular signals which involve the retention of muscle mass. This adjuvant exercise&#xD;
      interventions may also elicit improvements in cardio-metabolic health (vs. VLCD alone) via&#xD;
      improvements in blood vessel function. The inclusion or exclusion of additional protein&#xD;
      supplementation will also provide further data regarding whether it enhances any observed&#xD;
      muscle retaining effect of this intervention. The findings from this project could enhance&#xD;
      our understanding on the role of VLCD in inducing improvement in cardio-metabolic health,&#xD;
      provide rapid, practical low cost clinical interventions for people with T2DM and/or obesity,&#xD;
      while unearthing potential new therapeutic targets for the future management of high blood&#xD;
      sugar and obesity in people with T2DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PROTOCOL Subjects will be asked to fast from midnight (except clear water) prior to&#xD;
      attending DAY(-4). On this day, baseline investigations will include a DXA scan, fasting&#xD;
      specimen (blood glucose, saliva, muscle and fat) sample collection, vascular ultrasound scans&#xD;
      (flow mediated dilation (FMD) and contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), leg blood flow (LBF)).&#xD;
      A standard lunch will be provided in the afternoon. A cardiac echocardiogram (ECHO) will be&#xD;
      performed to assess cardiac function followed by cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) to&#xD;
      determine maximal aerobic capacity. A loading dose of D2O and D3 creatine tracer solutions&#xD;
      will then be given. Before leaving, subjects will be supplied with 3-Methylhistidine (3MH)&#xD;
      tracer solution to be taken 2 days later DAY(-2), plus daily 'top-ups' of D2O (all tracer&#xD;
      amounts based on body weight). Saliva bottles for thrice weekly saliva collection (3 hours&#xD;
      after daily D2O top up, to be stored in the fridge) and containers for urine collection for&#xD;
      D3 creatine (daily urine sample collection for 3 days in containers begin with 24-hour urine&#xD;
      collection, then spot urine at 30h, 48h and 72h) for muscle mass assessment will also be&#xD;
      provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After consuming 3MH on DAY(-2), subject then will attend our unit the following day (DAY(-1))&#xD;
      in the morning, fasted from midnight (except clear water). An initial leg ultrasound scan to&#xD;
      assess muscle structure will initially be undertaken. Hourly blood will be taken for 6 hours&#xD;
      to measure 3MH level (first sample to be taken after 20-24hours 3MH ingestion) in addition to&#xD;
      a oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with 2-Deoxyglucose (2DOG) tracer infusion to assess&#xD;
      glucose uptake. Urine collection every 3 hours will also be undertaken. Following this,&#xD;
      baseline muscle strength and function will be assessed for all intervention groups. This will&#xD;
      1 repetition maximum (1-RM) assessment in six (3 upper body, 3 lower body) exercises and the&#xD;
      maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) of leg extension by the volunteer's dominant leg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After this initial visit, subjects will begin their intervention period. All subjects will&#xD;
      have 6-week intervention period of VLCD nutritional intervention with LighterLife VLCD meal&#xD;
      replacement diets, 600kcal/day with 100% RDA vitamins and minerals. Meal replacements, which&#xD;
      will be acquired from LighterLife, comprise of four food packs a day in the forms of soups,&#xD;
      porridge, bars and drink mixes.&#xD;

Each exercise is performed for 60 seconds with a 90 seconds recovery period. Each training session will begin with a two minute warm-up and cooldown (on-the-spot-jogging) followed by five minutes of static stretching. Volunteers would aim to exceed the initial number of star jumps and standing squats in the subsequent attempt per cycle. A total of three training sessions per week are to be completed, preferably non-consecutive but may be consecutive on no more than two training sessions per week. Progression is through a gradual increase in volume (repetitions of star jumps and standing squats) on a per-session basis.</description>
