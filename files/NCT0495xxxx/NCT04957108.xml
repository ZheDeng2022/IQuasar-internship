  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smart phone-based applications to identify cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIED) are&#xD;
      extremely useful in circumstances where urgent device interrogation is needed and device&#xD;
      identification card is not available. Few studies have provided insight regarding the utility&#xD;
      of these applications. We have studied two widely available applications i.e., Pacemaker ID&#xD;
      app (PMIDa) or Cardiac Rhythm Management Devices-Finder (CRMD-f) to identiy device&#xD;
      manufacturers in CIEDs.&#xD;

      Smart phone-based applications to identify cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIED) are&#xD;

      identification card is not available. Few studies have provided insight regarding the utility&#xD;

      manufacturers in CIEDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      547 patients who underwent CIED implantation from year 2016 - 2020 in our institute were&#xD;
      enrolled. There were 438 Medtronic and 109 St. Jude's devices. All chest radiographs were&#xD;
      de-identified and resized into 225*225 pixels focusing on the CIED. PMIDa and CRMD-f&#xD;
      applications were used to identify CIED. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, negative&#xD;
      predictive value, and positive predictive value for both applications were calculated and&#xD;
      compared.&#xD;
