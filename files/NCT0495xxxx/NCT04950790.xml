      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-parallel-controlled multiplier designed to&#xD;
      observe and evaluate the efficacy and safety of Shuxuening injection in the treatment of&#xD;
      acute ischemic stroke for 10 days and continue follow-up to 90 days after the onset of the&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;

      Cerebral infarction (CI), also known as ischemic stroke, refers to the softening and necrosis&#xD;
      of local brain tissue due to blood circulation disorders, ischemia, and hypoxia. According to&#xD;
      the 2016 Stroke Epidemiology Report [4], there are currently 70 million stroke patients in my&#xD;
      country, 2 million new strokes occur each year, and 1.65 million deaths due to stroke each&#xD;
      year. There is one Chinese every 12 seconds. Stroke occurs, and one Chinese person dies of a&#xD;
      stroke every 21 seconds. Chinese people who die from a stroke each year account for 22.45% of&#xD;
      all deaths. According to the results of the study on the incidence and mortality of stroke in&#xD;
      the Chinese population, stroke is currently the number one cause of death in China,&#xD;
      accounting for 20% of deaths in urban populations and 19% in rural areas. Cerebral infarction&#xD;
      is a disease with high morbidity, high disability, high mortality and high recurrence rate in&#xD;
      China, and it has gradually attracted widespread attention from the whole society. Shuxuening&#xD;
      injection is developed by Shiyao Yinhu Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., and is a sterile aqueous&#xD;
      solution made of ginkgo biloba or ginkgo biloba extract. The auxiliary materials are ethanol&#xD;
      and vitamin C. Its main function is to expand blood vessels and improve microcirculation. It&#xD;
      is used for ischemic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, coronary heart disease,&#xD;
      angina pectoris, cerebral embolism, cerebral vasospasm, etc. This trial is a randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter clinical trial. The aim was to observe the&#xD;
      effectiveness and safety of Shuxuening injection in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke&#xD;
      for 10 days, and to continue follow-up to 90 days after the onset.&#xD;
