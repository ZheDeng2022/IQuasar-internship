      The primary objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To longitudinally characterize the long-term effectiveness of DUPIXENT® through&#xD;
           assessment of patient-reported symptoms, Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) related&#xD;
           to Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) and other type 2 comorbidities,&#xD;
           and their change over-time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize patients who receive DUPIXENT® for CRSwNP in a real-world setting with&#xD;
           respect to their medical history, demographic and disease characteristics, and type 2&#xD;
           comorbidities&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize real-world utilization of DUPIXENT® for patients with CRSwNP&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To collect patient and physician global assessment of disease severity and treatment&#xD;
           satisfaction for patients receiving DUPIXENT® for CRSwNP&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To collect long-term safety data for patients receiving DUPIXENT® for CRSwNP&#xD;
