  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AMUNDSEN-real is a phase IV, international (7 European countries), multicenter, controlled,&#xD;
      open label study randomized, in 2 parallel groups of patients with a diagnosis of STEMI or&#xD;
      NSTEMI with an indication for PCI, using the PROBE study design (Prospective Randomised Open,&#xD;
      Blinded Endpoint).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to demonstrate the superiority of evolocumab versus standard&#xD;
      of care in reaching a LDL-C reduction of ≥ 50% from baseline and a LDL-C goal of &lt;1.4 mmol/L&#xD;
      (&lt;55 mg/dL) at 12 months follow-up on the overall population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Central randomization uses an IWRS. Stratification is by center and stratum with random block&#xD;
      size, generated according to the procedures of the sponsor, by a statistician not involved in&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous randomized studies and several meta-analyses have shown a positive effect of&#xD;
      high-dose statins pretreatment on peri-procedural Myocardial Infarction (MI) incidence with&#xD;
      favorable trends on mortality in both Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) and stable Coronary&#xD;
      Artery Disease patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous epidemiological studies, Mendelian randomization studies, and Randomized Controled&#xD;
      Trials have consistently demonstrated a log-linear relationship between the absolute changes&#xD;
      in plasma LDL-C and the risk of Cardio-Vascular (CV) disease. The effect of LDL-C on the risk&#xD;
      of a new CV event appears to be determined by the absolute magnitude, the duration of&#xD;
      exposure to LDL-C and possibly the time to reach the recommended target of low LDL in ACS&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are good reasons to believe that the Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin type 9&#xD;
      (PCSK9) inhibitors could provide additional benefits when used early in MI patients treated&#xD;
      with PCI revascularization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      That's why the hypothesis of AMUNDSEN study is to demonstrate the superiority of a strategy&#xD;
      using evolocumab before PCI in STEMI or NSTEMI patients versus standard of care (SOC) as&#xD;
      described in the 2019 European Society of Cardiology / European Atherosclerosis Society&#xD;
      (ESC/EAS) guidelines on dyslipidemia, to reach a Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C)&#xD;
      reduction of ≥ 50% from baseline and a LDL-C goal of &lt;1.4 mmol/L (&lt;55 mg/dL) at the end of&#xD;
      the study (LDL targets of the 2019 ESC/EAS guidelines).&#xD;
