  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Conventional therapy of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) is not always effective and&#xD;
      sometimes leads to side effects and also to inappropriate use of antibiotic. Hence, a search&#xD;
      for safe and effective further treatment options is justified and would be a welcome addition&#xD;
      to available conventional treatment. Use of plant based dietary supplements has become&#xD;
      increasingly popular over the last few decades or so. Research based on some plants is more&#xD;
      than centuries old and its main therapeutic objective is to stimulate the self-healing power&#xD;
      of the body. Andrographolide was docked successfully in the binding site of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.&#xD;
      Computational approaches also predicts this molecule to have good solubility,&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics property and target accuracy. This molecule also obeys Lipinski's rule,&#xD;
      which makes it a promising compound to pursue further biochemical and cell based assays to&#xD;
      explore its potential for use against COVID-19. A. Paniculata is a patented extract,&#xD;
      standardized to Andrographolide, 14-deoxyandrographolide, and Neo-andrographolide. Maqui&#xD;
      contains Maqui Berry Extract of Aristotelia Chilensis (10% Anthocyanidin, 8% Delphinidin)&#xD;
      belonging to the family of Elaeocarpaceae, which has been known for its use in several&#xD;
      conditions such as sore throat, fever and several other ailments. In the present study, the&#xD;
      therapeutic potential of Andrographis Paniculata and Aristotelia chilensis as single&#xD;
      ingredients as well as in combination will be evaluated in participants with common cold and&#xD;
      COVID related symptoms. The products to be evaluated have been rigorously standardized and&#xD;
      are available under the brand names of A. Paniculata and A. Chilensis. Literature indicates&#xD;
      that both A. Paniculata and A.Chilensis are effective and safe in the treatment of typical&#xD;
      cold-related symptoms in adults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The common cold is one of the most frequent minor illnesses in the world. A large US-American&#xD;
      survey showed that over 70% of the population annually was suffering from at least one viral&#xD;
      respiratory tract infection. Also the economic burden in the USA was almost USD 40 billion&#xD;
      annually causing considerable direct and indirect healthcare costs. Caused by 200 identified&#xD;
      types of viruses, the common cold is primarily associated with rhinoviruses. Common cold&#xD;
      symptoms may include sore throat, runny nose, general malaise, and low-grade fever at onset,&#xD;
      followed by nasal congestion and cough. While benign, they last for several days and cause&#xD;
      40% of all missed work days. Complications also include sinusitis, otitis media and&#xD;
      pneumonia, exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and serious&#xD;
      illness in immunocompromised patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colds typically afflict most adults and adolescents 2-4 times a year and symptoms usually&#xD;
      peak around day 3 or 4 and last 1-2 weeks with a median of 7 days. There is no approved&#xD;
      specific therapy for URTI, treatment is therefore mainly symptomatic. The most common&#xD;
      pharmacological treatments are antipyretics, anti-inflammatory drugs, expectorants,&#xD;
      decongestants, and cough suppressants, either alone or in combination. Supportive measures&#xD;
      can include bed rest, hot baths, and inhalations, gargling, and drinking plenty of fluids.&#xD;
      Antibiotics are widely prescribed, but often is inappropriate because URTI are mostly caused&#xD;
      by viruses and are only indicated in the case of bacterial infection. Its overuse can also&#xD;
      lead to the development of community acquired resistant pathogens which are an increasing and&#xD;
      serious health burden.&#xD;
