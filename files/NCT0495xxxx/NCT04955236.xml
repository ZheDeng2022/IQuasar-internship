  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain in patients undergoing posterior fossa surgery is regarded as more intense when compared&#xD;
      to pain in patients undergoing supratentorial cranial surgeries. It may result in a rise in&#xD;
      blood pressure and heart rate leading to serious effects as increased intracranial pressure&#xD;
      and intracranial hemorrhage. For a long time, the control of pain has been the role of&#xD;
      opioids. However, the use of opioids is not devoid of side effects. Hence, combining other&#xD;
      techniques as partial scalp block with general anesthesia may be beneficial in controlling&#xD;
      hemodynamics and decreasing the amount of opioids used without sacrificing the good quality&#xD;
      of analgesia and anesthesia.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Pain in patients undergoing posterior fossa surgery is regarded as more intense when compared&#xD;
      to pain in patients undergoing supratentorial cranial surgeries. The main cause has been&#xD;
      attributed to the substantial muscle dissection and trauma in this area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Opioids remain as the current gold standard drugs for operative pain relief. However,&#xD;
      exposure to large doses leads to multiple side effects of varying significance, such as&#xD;
      nausea, vomiting, dizziness, constipation, respiratory depression, hypoventilation and&#xD;
      disorders of breathing during sleep. Therefore, strategies other than opioids are recommended&#xD;
      without sacrificing proper and effective analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the previously mentioned facts, supplementing general anesthesia with regional&#xD;
      anesthesia has been considered and was found to improve intraoperative hemodynamics, surgical&#xD;
      field and postoperative analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In neurosurgery, scalp blocks and local anesthetic infiltration are being used along with&#xD;
      general anesthesia either preoperatively to decrease the hemodynamic response to head pinning&#xD;
      and surgical incision or postoperatively before emergence from anesthesia to decrease&#xD;
      postoperative pain and result in a better outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study aims to compare between partial scalp block(greater,lesser and third&#xD;
      occipital nerve blocks) on the one hand versus fentanyl infusion on the other hand as pain&#xD;
      controlling measures reflected on intraoperative hemodynamics in patients undergoing&#xD;
      posterior fossa surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After approval of ethics research committee and obtaining informed written consents from the&#xD;
      patient's first degree relatives, 40 patients will be randomly divided by computer designed&#xD;
      lists and then concealed in closed serially numbered, opaque envelopes into 2 equal groups to&#xD;
      receive either partial scalp block(greater,lesser and third occipital nerve blocks) or&#xD;
      fentanyl infusion after induction of general anesthesia by a conventional method and assuming&#xD;
      the prone position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For group N (partial nerve block group): The scalp blocks will be performed bilaterally after&#xD;
      assuming the prone position by an anesthesiologist who will not be a part of the study team&#xD;
      nor will be involved in the proceeding data analysis or other parts of the study. The Greater&#xD;
      occipital will be blocked by injecting 3ml of local anaesthetic at a point half way between&#xD;
      the mastoid process the external occipital protuberance along the superior nuchal line,&#xD;
      medial to the occipital artery. The Lesser occipital nerve will be blocked by injecting 3ml&#xD;
      of local anaesthetic infiltration along the superior nuchal line, 2.5 cm lateral to the&#xD;
      greater occipital nerve block. The greater occipital nerve block will also cover the third&#xD;
      occipital nerve due to the close location of the two nerves (8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To anesthetize the dura Lidocaine soaked gauzes will be used and applied for 10 minutes&#xD;
      before dural incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A placebo infusion (normal saline) was administered at the same rate as fentanyl infusion (1&#xD;
      µg/kg/hr.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For group F ( Fentanyl group):1µg/kg/hr. of intravenous fentanyl infusion will be&#xD;
      administered. A syringe filled with 20 ml of normal saline will be prepared and 3 ml of&#xD;
      normal saline will be injected at the same points of the partial scalp block previously&#xD;
      mentioned. Both the syringe containing bupivacaine and adrenaline and the placebo syringe&#xD;
      will be prepared by a blinded clinical pharmacist, who will not be a part of the study team&#xD;
      nor will be involved in the proceeding data analysis or other parts of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be the systolic blood pressure at time of skin incision. the sample&#xD;
      size was calculated using the medcalc software. Based on the study &quot;Bupivacaine scalp nerve&#xD;
      block: Hemodynamic response during craniotomy, intraoperative and post-operative analgesia&quot;&#xD;
      published in Asian biomedicine (2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total sample size required was 36 participants to be randomly allocated between two&#xD;
      groups to achieve a confidence level of 95%, power of study 80% with confidence interval of&#xD;
      1. The sample size was increased to 40 (20 per group) to guard against dropouts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPSS software will be used for data analysis. Categorical data will be expressed as&#xD;
      frequencies and percentages and will be analyzed using chi-square test. Continuous data will&#xD;
      be tested for normality by means of shapiro-wilk test and will be analyzed using unpaired t&#xD;
      test, Mann Whitney test, and analysis of variance test (ANOVA) as appropriate. The numerical&#xD;
      data will be presented as mean and standard deviation or median and interquartile range as&#xD;
      appropriate. A P value less than 0.05 will be considered significant.&#xD;
