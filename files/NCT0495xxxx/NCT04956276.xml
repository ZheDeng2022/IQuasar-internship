  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, multiple ascending, dose-finding, randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, health-related quality of life,&#xD;
      tolerability, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and immunogenicity, of up to 3 dose regimens&#xD;
      of ALXN1830 administered subcutaneous(ly) (SC) in the treatment of WAIHA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will include 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cohorts (Cohorts 1 and&#xD;
      2) to evaluate an 8-week treatment regimen, and an optional third open-label cohort (Cohort&#xD;
      3) to evaluate an alternative 12-week dosing regimen. Participants may continue participation&#xD;
      in this study at the participant's and investigator's discretion in an open-label extension&#xD;
      (OLE) period, consisting of monthly visits to observe participants for relapse, which will&#xD;
      require going back on active treatment.&#xD;
