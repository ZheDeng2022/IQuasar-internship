      This study will collect real-world data for the new treatment pathways for all patients with&#xD;
      Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma (ARCC) who were treated with a 1L IO (first-line,&#xD;
      Immuno-Oncology checkpoint inhibitor) combination therapy and progressed to a 2L treatment&#xD;
      with particular focus to understanding where cabozantinib is prescribed after 1L IO&#xD;
      containing combination therapy.&#xD;
