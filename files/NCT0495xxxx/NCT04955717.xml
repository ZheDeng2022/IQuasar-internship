      To assess the effectiveness of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG)&#xD;
      testing and treatment during pregnancy to reduce adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes&#xD;
      compared to the standard of care (treatment based on symptoms and signs).&#xD;

      In this study investigators are conducting a two-arm, cluster randomized trial to assess the&#xD;
      effectiveness of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) testing and&#xD;
      treatment during pregnancy to reduce adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes compared to the&#xD;
      standard of care (treatment based on symptoms and signs). Investigators will enroll 500&#xD;
      asymptomatic pregnant women in the testing and treatment clinics, and they will receive CT&#xD;
      and NG testing and appropriate treatment at their first antenatal care visit and at a visit&#xD;
      during their third trimester. An additional 250 asymptomatic pregnant women will be enrolled&#xD;
      in the standard of care clinics, and they will receive syndromic management with additional&#xD;
      support for partner notification. All participants will be tested for CT and NG at the first&#xD;
      postnatal visit and those who test positive will be offered infant testing. Investigators&#xD;
      will determine if antenatal testing and treatment reduces maternal infections at delivery,&#xD;
      preterm birth, low birth weight, and neonatal CT/NG infection. This study will provide&#xD;
      evidence to help evaluate the effects of testing on vertical transmission and clinically&#xD;
      important pregnancy neonatal health outcomes, and to evaluate and understand biological&#xD;
      correlates of transmission.&#xD;
