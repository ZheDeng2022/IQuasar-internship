      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a mobile application (app) called &quot;Goal2QuitVaping&quot;&#xD;

      to assist with quitting vaping. Participants will be randomly assigned to either download the&#xD;
      mobile app, &quot;Goal2QuitVaping&quot;, or not. If provided with Goal2QuitVaping, participants will be&#xD;
      asked to use the app regularly, at least once per day, throughout the study duration.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to complete electronic questionnaire measures throughout the study&#xD;
      period. Participation in this study will take about 4 weeks.&#xD;
