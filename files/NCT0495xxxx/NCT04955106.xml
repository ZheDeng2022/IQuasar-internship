      The device that is the subject of this investigation is a diagnostic tool to detect the among&#xD;
      of fluid in hypodermis to help to prevent the formation of pressure injuries. The Sub&#xD;
      Epidermal Moister(SEM) Scanner, is a non invasive portable medical device use to complet the&#xD;
      clinical jugement of clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study &quot;RELIASEM&quot; will study hospitalized patients with high risk of Pressure Injurieswith&#xD;
      the next conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each patient 14 mesures: 6 on the sacrum, 4 on the right heel and 4 on the left heel.&#xD;
      This set of measure will be realized 2 timesby 4 different evaluator. To will have been&#xD;
      trained in the use of the SEM Scanner where as the other will be novice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to determine on a risk population the intra- and&#xD;
      inter-examiner reliability of the SEM Scanner&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The SEM Scanner is placed on three skin areas (left heel, right heel and sacrum). It measures the moisture of the subcutaneous tissues. If returns a figure wich induces a classification&#xD;
negative = value &lt;0.6 no risk, the figure is displayed in green&#xD;
positive = value ≥0.6 proven risk, the figure is displayed in orange&#xD;
For each patient 3 measurements will be performed. Two of them will have been trained in the use of the SEM Scanner, whereas the others will be novice</intervention_model_description>
