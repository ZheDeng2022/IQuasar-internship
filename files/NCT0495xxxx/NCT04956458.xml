      This study is a single blind, randomized controlled trail. condition/disease: acute low back&#xD;

    <textblock>
      &quot;Motion Style Acupuncture Treatment(MSAT)&quot; is a therapeutic technique using acupuncture&#xD;
      needle created in Jaseng Hospital. This treatment involves patients with musculoskeletal pain&#xD;
      to move the part of their body actively during acupuncture treatment under physicians'&#xD;
      observation. This treatment is known to relieve the pain and increase the range of&#xD;
      motion(ROM). However, there has been no specific value for the effect of this treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So, the investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trials to verify the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of Lumbar MSAT. From March 2021 to December 2021, the investigators will collect 96&#xD;
      inpatients who are suffered from Low back pain with the numeric rating scale(NRS) over 5&#xD;
      after injury by acute traffic accident(TA). For experimental group(n=48), the investigators&#xD;
      will conduct MSAT three times(on 2nd, 3rd and 4th day of hospitalization) and other Korean&#xD;
      medical treatment. For control group(n=48), just Korean medical treatment except MSAT will be&#xD;
      conducted. For these two groups, the investigators will compare NRS, Visual Analogue&#xD;
      Scale(VAS), Range Of Motion(ROM), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and EuroQol 5-Dimension&#xD;
      (EQ-5D), Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC).&quot;&#xD;

    <time_frame>Change from baseline NRS at 4 days</time_frame>
    <description>The extent of Low back pain and discomfort will be assessed using NRS. NRS is a pain scale in which the patient indicates their subjective pain as a whole number from 0 to 10. The participant is asked to report their low back pain and discomfort using NRS, where 0 indicates 'no pain or discomfort' and 10 indicates 'the most severe pain and discomfort imaginable'.</description>

    <measure>EuroQol 5-Dimension (EQ-5D)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline(day2), day3, day4, day of discharge(up to 14days), week12</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D is a method of indirectly calculating the weights of certain health states for quality of life after a multidimensional investigation of health states, and is the most widely used instrument for this purpose. The EQ-5D consists of 5 questions about current health state (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain, anxiety/depression), and each question is scored on a 5-point Likert scale (1=no problems, 3=moderate problems, 5=severe problems). In this study, the investigators will use the Korean version of the EQ-5D, which has been demonstrated to be valid.</description>

    <measure>Patient Global Impression of Change(PGIC)</measure>
    <time_frame>day4, day of discharge(up to 14days), week12</time_frame>
    <description>The PGIC is an index that assesses improvements in functional limitation caused by whiplash injury. Participants rate the improvement in functional limitations after treatment on a 7-point Likert scale (1=Very much improved, 4=No change, 7=Very much worse). This index was originally developed for use in Psychology, but is currently used in various other medical fields to assess improvements in pain.</description>
