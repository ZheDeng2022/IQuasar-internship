      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      DC and related TBDs are a group of illnesses caused by variants in genes that regulate&#xD;
      telomeres. These illnesses can cause problems with the skin and mucous membranes. They can&#xD;
      also cause ophthalmic, dental, immunologic, and other abnormalities. Researchers want to&#xD;
      learn more about these illnesses and the people who have them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn about the informational, pragmatic, and psychosocial challenges and unmet needs of&#xD;
      individuals and families affected by DC and related TBDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People aged 18 years and older who have DC or related TBD or who are, or have been, a&#xD;
      caregiver to someone with DC or related TBD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has 2 parts: a survey and a telephone interview. Participants may choose to take&#xD;
      part in one or both parts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may complete an online survey. They will select which group most applies to&#xD;
      them: person with DC/TBD; parent/caregiver to a person with DC/TBD; or bereaved&#xD;
      parent/caregiver of a person who had DC/TBD. The survey will be based on the group they&#xD;
      choose. They will answer 20-30 questions. The survey will take 10-20 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may take part in a phone interview. It will take 50-70 minutes to complete. They&#xD;
      will give their name, email address, and phone number to schedule the interview. The&#xD;
      interview will be audio recorded and transcribed. Personal identifiers will be removed.&#xD;

      Study Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is exploratory and aims to conduct a needs assessment for individuals and families&#xD;
      living with DC and related TBDs. The study has two parts. For the first part of the study,&#xD;
      participants will complete an online survey. The second part of the study involves&#xD;
      participating in an interview via telephone. Interviews will address important questions in&#xD;
      greater depth. Individuals have the option to participate in one or both parts of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using online survey methodology and qualitative interviews, the purpose of this concurrent&#xD;
      mixed methods study is to conduct a needs assessment about the informational, pragmatic, and&#xD;
      psychosocial challenges and unmet needs of individuals and families affected by DC and&#xD;
      related TBDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an exploratory study; therefore, we are not generating a priori hypotheses.&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be limited to calculating descriptive statistics (frequencies,&#xD;
      percentages, chi-square statistics) and statistical analyses that do not require a large&#xD;
      number of observations (Pearson's r, ANOVA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We anticipate enrolling a minimum of 30 individuals 18 years or older with the overall&#xD;
      accrual set at 100.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Sites/Facilities Enrolling Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The single site for enrollment is the National Cancer Institute (NCI). NCI investigators will&#xD;
      recruit participants through a patient advocacy group called, Team Telomere.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The online survey should take approximately 10-20 minutes. The interview should take&#xD;
      approximately 50-70 minutes. If participants decided to complete both parts of the study then&#xD;
      total participant time should take approximately 60-90 minutes.&#xD;
