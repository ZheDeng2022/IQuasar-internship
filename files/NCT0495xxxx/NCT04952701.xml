      The objective of the study is to adapt existing multifocal soft lens wearers to a CONTROL&#xD;
      lens for 2 weeks and then evaluate the success of switching them to the TEST lens, with a&#xD;
      review after 2 weeks.&#xD;

      This is a prospective, crossover, bilateral daily wear and subject masked dispensing study.&#xD;
      The habitual contact lenses will not be optimized. There will be no randomization of the&#xD;
      study lenses, participants will wear the control lenses for the first wear period and the&#xD;
      test for the second wear period. Participants will wear each study lens for 3-7 days and then&#xD;
      attend for a prescription optimization visit. After this optimization visit they will wear&#xD;
      each study lens for a 2-week period. During the 2-week wear period, participants will record&#xD;
      their subjective lens-wear experience remotely.&#xD;
