      Objective: Cervical facet joint (CFJ) pain is commonly seen after whiplash injuries, and is&#xD;
      frequently refractory to physical therapy and oral medication. The investigators will&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness of intra-articular corticosteroid injection for managing&#xD;
      whiplash-related CFJ pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The investigators will recruit 32 patients with chronic and persistent CFJ pain (≥ 3&#xD;
      on the Numeric Rating Scale [NRS]) despite physical therapy and oral medication. Under&#xD;
      fluoroscopy guidance, The investigators will inject 10 mg (0.25 mL) of triamcinolone&#xD;
      acetonide, mixed with 0.25 mL of 0.125% bupivacaine and 0.5 mL of normal saline. At 1 and 2&#xD;
      months after the injection, pain intensity will be reassessed using the NRS.&#xD;

    <description>Patients in the injection group will be injected 10 mg (0.25 mL) of triamcinolone acetonide, mixed with 0.25 mL of 0.125% bupivacaine and 0.5 mL of normal saline.</description>

    <intervention_name>Injection with triamcinolone acetonide, bupivacaine, and normal saline</intervention_name>
    <description>Triamcinolone acetonide is a synthetic corticosteroid medication used intra-articularly to treat various joint conditions. Bupivacaine is a medication used to decrease feeling in a specific area. In nerve blocks, it is injected around a nerve that supplies the area, or into the spinal canal's epidural space. Saline is most commonly used as a sterile 9 g of salt per litre (0.9%) solution, known as normal saline.&#xD;
The procedure will be performed with the patient in a prone position under a C-arm fluoroscopy scanner, with the thorax rests on 2 pillows, flexing the neck maximally, and the head turns 60-90° away from the side of injection. The C-arm tube will be angled cephalad, until it was at a tangent to the cervical facet joint space. A 26-gauge, 90 mm spinal needle will be inserted parallel to the C-arm beam. To confirm intra-articular placement of the needle tip, an arthrogram of the cervical facet joint will be performed by injecting 0.3 mL of contrast.</description>
