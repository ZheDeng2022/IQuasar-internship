      METHODOLOGY: a randomized clinical study carried out in an educational group at the Basic&#xD;
      Health Unit Nova Bonsucesso with six monthly meetings scheduled with 24 patients with type II&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus users of oral hypoglycemic agents divided into two subgroups: 12 users in&#xD;
      the control group and 12 users in the control group. study (which will receive the&#xD;
      interventions of the multidisciplinary team) and will be accompanied by laboratory tests and&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION: diabetes mellitus is highlighted as an obstacle in health equipment because it&#xD;
      is a chronic disease and has a high mortality rate. The pathology results in hyperglycemia,&#xD;
      disorders or insufficiency of several organs. OBJECTIVE: to verify the effectiveness of&#xD;
      adopting the practice of educational groups in primary care and the multidisciplinary role in&#xD;
      the control of diabetes mellitus in adults. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND: type II diabetes mellitus&#xD;
      (type II DM) is a pathology that represents a high risk for cardiovascular, renal,&#xD;
      ophthalmological complications and in several other systems. It is considered a major issue&#xD;
      to be controlled by health services, as the high cost of treatments related to the sequelae&#xD;
      of type II DM, as well as high rates of hospitalizations and associated therapies have been&#xD;
      increasing and decompensating public budgets. Primary care has a fundamental role in&#xD;
      preventing the disease and associated complications. METHODOLOGY: randomized clinical study&#xD;
      conducted in an educational group at the Basic Health Unit Nova Bonsucesso with six monthly&#xD;
      meetings scheduled with 24 patients with type II diabetes mellitus users of oral hypoglycemic&#xD;
      agents divided into two subgroups: 12 users in the control group and 12 users in the group&#xD;
      study (which will receive the interventions of the multidisciplinary team) and will be&#xD;
      accompanied by laboratory tests and individual evaluations to verify the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      multidisciplinary performance in the control of diabetes mellitus. RESULTS: the participants&#xD;
      are expected to show improvements in the control of the pathology and awareness about the&#xD;
      relevance of self-care, facts that will be observed through laboratory data and subsequent&#xD;
      multi-professional evaluations.&#xD;
