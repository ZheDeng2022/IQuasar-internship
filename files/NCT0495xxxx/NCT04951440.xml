      The main purpose of the study: To evaluate the effect of nitrosone 1 special for patients&#xD;
      with acute ischemic cerebral stroke. The secondary purpose of the study: To evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the injection of nitrosone I. T for loyal patients with acute ischemic&#xD;

&#xD;
      This experiment adopts randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel design. In&#xD;
      patients with acute, ischemic cerebral rate as the research object, after selected exclusion&#xD;
      standard screening, if doesn't fit or don't agree with thrombolysis subjects, giving from&#xD;
      connect to test a drug or a placebo treatment, if appropriate and agreed to thrombolysis of&#xD;
      the subjects with an experimental drug or placebo after thrombolysis treatment.Intervention&#xD;
      group: 30) min uniform given 1400 mg intravenous drip injection with ketone wordy, nitrate&#xD;
      dosing volume 100 ml. Day delivery, two intervals of 12 h, for seven days in a row, namely to&#xD;
      14 times in total.The placebo group: 30 min to 100 ml placebo at a constant speed intravenous&#xD;
      drip (sodium chloride injection), dosing W times a day, 12 h, for seven days in a row, namely&#xD;
      to 14 times in total.During treatment, participants in the group after injection with nitrate&#xD;
      ketone oxazine (giving injections with nitrate ketone oxazine time window &lt; 6 h, that is,&#xD;
      from &quot;the last look normal time&quot; to start infusion nitrate obviously time) or placebo and&#xD;
      other foundation treatment. Record for the first time to give the time of nitrate ketone&#xD;
      oxazine or placebo for injection, lie between 8 and 12 h 2 times to medicine.&quot;After 12 h&#xD;
      dosing interval, until finish to 14 times (for convenient subjects out of the hospital and&#xD;
      acceptable to 13).Allow this study drug and placebo and thrombolysis drug dosing dual channel&#xD;
      at the same timeStop to test drug or placebo, in the group of 8 days, 14 days, 30 days, the&#xD;
      90th day to evaluate curative effect, respectively.In the I the ili is not ah into subgroups&#xD;
