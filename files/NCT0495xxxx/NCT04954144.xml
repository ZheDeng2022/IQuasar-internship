  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral Palsy (CP) is a neurodevelopmental dysfunction which is permanent, non-progressive,&#xD;
      and caused by brain insult or injury.Although the basic finding of CP is having motor&#xD;
      function problems, visual, auditory, cognitive and behavioural problems are also seen in&#xD;
      CP.Having these problems interfere the functional independence of children with CP, so their&#xD;
      daily life of activities is limited.One of the way of increasing the functional independence&#xD;
      of these children is providing them hand rehabilitation.In the event of having hand&#xD;
      rehabilitation, children would achieve more daily living skills.Although having hand&#xD;
      rehabilitation is crucial for these children, they would lose their motivation on this by the&#xD;
      time because rehabilitation is a long process,For that reason, new therapy techniques are&#xD;
      tried by therapists to motivate these children during their rehabilitation seances.Virtual&#xD;
      reality rehabilitation is one of these new techniques used for designing enjoyable and&#xD;
      effective seances.Especially leap motion sensors are preferred to create virtual environment,&#xD;
      because they are cheap, portable, touchless and easy to use.These sensors can detect hand&#xD;
      movements and recognize hand gestures by using infrared.Our study was aimed to investigate&#xD;
      the effect of fine motor grip studies in virtual reality environment on performance based&#xD;
      hand skills in children with CP.Thirty two children with CP (6-18) were included in this&#xD;
      study.Children were randomly assigned into two equal-sized groups: control and study&#xD;
      groups.Participants in both groups received a neurodevelopmental therapy program.The study&#xD;
      group additionally received virtual reality rehabilitation programme. In control group,&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental treatment was provided 45 mins,2 d/week for 2 successive months.In study&#xD;
      group, neurodevelopmental treatment was provided 30 mins and virtual rehabilitation programme&#xD;
      was provided 15 mins, 2 d/week for 2 successive months. To evaluate the performance based&#xD;
      hand skills; Box and Block Test, Nine Hole Peg Test and Pink Tower (Montessori) Test were&#xD;
      used.&#xD;

      Cerebral palsy (CP) can be defined as a permanent, non-progressive, motor function, posture&#xD;
      and developmental disorder that causes movement limitation due to a lesion that can occur in&#xD;
      the brain due to prenatal, perinatal and postnatal reasons.Although the etiology of the&#xD;
      disease cannot be determined precisely, the reasons causing SP; It is stated that it occurs&#xD;
      in prenatal, perinatal and postnatal periods. Sometimes, more than one factor can be found&#xD;
      together.Another common problem in individuals with CP is seen in upper extremity functions,&#xD;
      and limiting upper extremity functions also affects the independence of daily living&#xD;
      activities. The condition of the hand in the early period of rehabilitation has an important&#xD;
      place for upper extremity functions in the future.In this respect, it is very important to&#xD;
      include a program to develop manual skills in the rehabilitation process in order to make&#xD;
      children with CP more independent in daily life activities.Neurodevelopmental Treatment&#xD;
      Approach, widely used in the treatment of children with Cerebral Palsy; It is a method that&#xD;
      tries to control sensorimotor components of muscle tone, reflexes, abnormal movement&#xD;
      patterns, postural control, sensory-perception and memory problems with special&#xD;
      techniques.Virtual reality is a three-dimensional simulation that makes you feel to be in any&#xD;
      &quot;place&quot; and provides this by giving various inputs to our sensory organs. According to motor&#xD;
      control and motor learning theory, it is important to carry out repetitive, target-oriented&#xD;
      studies that increase motivation in the rehabilitation of children with Cerebral Palsy and it&#xD;
      is important to include games and entertainment in the treatment program. To achieve this,&#xD;
      making virtual reality a component of rehabilitation can cause the treatment process to be&#xD;
      more functional and effective.Research has shown that computer games designed for a specific&#xD;
      purpose can increase the motivation of children to increase the use of the affected&#xD;
      extremities and positively improve the strength and functionality of the affected&#xD;
      muscles.Leap Motion Sensors have been developed to detect hand movements. It can detect the&#xD;
      movement of the hand by emitting infrared rays in a restricted area. Physiotherapists have&#xD;
      stated that virtual reality rehabilitation applied with Leap Motion Sensors can be an&#xD;
      effective method that increases motivation in the treatment process in children with special&#xD;
      needs.Our study was aimed to investigate the effect of fine motor grip studies in virtual&#xD;
      reality environment on performance based hand skills in children with CP.After the approval&#xD;
      of the ethics committee, children with cerebral palsy were included in the study.Parental&#xD;
      approval was obtained.Reports from Health Council was examined to check diagnosis of&#xD;
      children.The study was performed in three centers: University of Abant Izzet Baysal, Silivri&#xD;
      Rehabilitation Center and Reyhan Rehabilitation Center.Thirty two children with CP (6-18)&#xD;
      were included in this study.Exclusion criteria were; epilepsy history, cognitive problems,&#xD;
      visual impairment, having problem on holding and releasing the objects.Children were randomly&#xD;
      assigned into two equal-sized groups: control and study groups.Participants in both groups&#xD;
      received a neurodevelopmental therapy program.The study group additionally received virtual&#xD;
      reality rehabilitation programme.As a normal developmental treatment method, functional&#xD;
      skills exercises, inhibition of abnormal movement patterns, sensory-motor integration in&#xD;
      purposeful movements, stretching and strengthening exercises, and daily life activities were&#xD;
      trained.As a virtual reality treatment method, object catching, firefly, bee-batting games&#xD;
      were used, which improved performance-dependent dexterity by integrating leap motion sensors&#xD;
      into the laptop.In control group, neurodevelopmental treatment was provided 45 mins,2&#xD;
      days/week for 2 successive months.In study group, neurodevelopmental treatment was provided&#xD;
      30 mins and virtual rehabilitation programme was provided 15 mins, 2 days/week for 2&#xD;
      successive months.In virtual reality treatment, each game was studied for 5 minutes and 3&#xD;
      games for a total of 15 minutes.Before and after the study, tests that measure&#xD;
      performance-related dexterity were applied and the previous and next results of the groups&#xD;
      were compared.SPSS statistics program was used for statistical evaluation of data belonging&#xD;
      to participants.In statistical evaluations, p &lt;0.05 was considered as significant.In the data&#xD;
      analysis of the study, in order to select the appropriate statistical analysis, whether the&#xD;
      distribution of the data is suitable for normal distribution was determined by the&#xD;
      &quot;one-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov&quot; test.&quot;Independent T Test&quot; was used to compare age, height,&#xD;
      body weight, the measures pre-treatment and post-treatment, .Gender and affected sides were&#xD;
      compared by using &quot;Chi-Square Test&quot;.&#xD;
