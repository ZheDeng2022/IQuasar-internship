  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a validation study of a conscientiousness-based phone app intervention strategy to&#xD;
      help people with their health management and employment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to establish whether people with MS with low Conscientiousness&#xD;
      benefit from a cognitive-behavioral, phone app intervention. The investigators also aim to&#xD;
      determine the acceptability and utilization of the Conscientiousness-Coach phone application&#xD;
      and intervention. It is anticipated that the Conscientiousness-Coach phone app intervention&#xD;
      will result in fewer negative work events and increased work accommodations in those treated,&#xD;
      relative to the control group. In exploration of other secondary outcomes, the investigators&#xD;
      also expect that the treatment will result in increased self-report trait Conscientiousness&#xD;
      itself, increase in structured leisure activities, reduction in depression, and reduction in&#xD;
      anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective longitudinal design with an experimental manipulation (i.e., a&#xD;
      randomized-controlled trial). There will be an initial assessment with neuropsychological&#xD;
      testing, the Buffalo Vocational Monitoring Survey (BVMS), and several self-report measures,&#xD;
      and a post-test assessment after three months and six months with these same instruments,&#xD;
      excluding the neuropsychological assessment. The BVMS will also be administered at 0 months,&#xD;
      3 months, and 6 months to further assess post-treatment effects.&#xD;

    <measure>Buffalo Vocational Monitoring Survey (BVMS): change from baseline to 12 weeks and from baseline to 24 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, Week 12, and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Assesses general employment information (e.g. number of hours worked per week, job title, and income) and work-related problems and accommodations. Participants will identify specific negative work events (e.g. formal reprimand) experienced in the past 3 months and provide a list of job accommodations to endorse if they are receiving them at the time of survey. Income, number of hours worked per week, number of negative work events (0 to 7, with higher number indicating more negative work events), and number of accommodations (0 to 40, with higher number indicating more accommodations) will be used as outcomes from this survey.</description>

    <measure>The Valued Living Questionnaire (VLQ): change from baseline to 12 weeks and from baseline to 24 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, Week 12, and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Assesses valued living, or the extent to which an individual contacts his or her chosen values in everyday life. Respondents are asked to rate the 10 areas of life on a scale of 1-10, indicating the level of importance and how consistently they have lived in accord with those values in the past week. The composite score is used (1-100 points), with higher scores indicating a greater extent to which one is living out particular values in everyday life.</description>

    <time_frame>At baseline, Week 12, and Week 24.</time_frame>
    <description>Personality inventory measuring five primary domains of personality: neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. Total scores are 12-60 on each domain's scale, with higher scores indicating higher levels of that personality trait.</description>

    <description>Measure of quality of life for neurology patients. We are using the four subscales of Communication, Ability to Participate in Social Roles and Activities, Satisfaction with Social Roles and Activities, and Positive Affect and Well Being. T-scores are used with higher T-scores indicating greater quality of life in each respective domain.</description>

    <description>Participants will use the Conscientiousness Coach app to organize their goals and assist them in engaging in more conscientious behaviors. The participant will also be educated about Conscientiousness as it relates to healthy living and accomplishing life goals and values. Participants will receive brief phone calls during weeks 1, 2, 6, and 10 from the research assistant, tracking progress, answering queries, and return visits to the clinic/teleconference will be scheduled for further assistance during week 4 and week 8. These mid-study visits (or 'Booster Sessions') will last approximately 50 minutes and will involve a brief discussion of goal and value progress and app usage; at this in-person meeting/teleconference, similar questions and topics will be covered as in the bi-monthly phone calls. At week 12, there is a treatment termination visit with the principal investigator and research assistant.</description>
