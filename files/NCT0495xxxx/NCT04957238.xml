  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of physical restraints is common practice in Intensive Care Units (ICU). This&#xD;
      medically prescribed procedure requires full attention of medical and paramedical teams for&#xD;
      its implementation, monitoring and ending, as a major restriction of patients' individual&#xD;
      freedom. French highest authority for health has defined, for geriatrics and psychiatric&#xD;
      units, ten criteria of good practice for physical restraints' use. Routine practice reports&#xD;
      critically ill patients' safety as main reason of use. This decision, often left to the sole&#xD;
      discretion of nurses, varies according to their own representation of this risk, and depends&#xD;
      on several factors: seniority in ICU, nurse to patient ratio and personal workload.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to reduce practices subjectivity and heterogeneity, we have developed a&#xD;
      decision-making tool for physical restraints implementation. This tool is based on objective&#xD;
      scales used on a daily basis concerning neurological status (Richmond Agitation-Sedation&#xD;
      Scale (RASS) and Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU)). Disorientation or&#xD;
      delirium can lead to severe incidents by promoting accidental removing of important devices&#xD;
      such as arterial of venous line, drains among others. However, physical restraints are&#xD;
      recognized as a major cause of delirium and agitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Critically ill patients require rigorous evaluation of organ dysfunctions necessitating&#xD;
      adequate invasive equipments, with associated risks of unexpected removal or alteration. Such&#xD;
      events could urge caregivers to use physical restraints. Based on recent literature, about a&#xD;
      third of ICU patients are restrained, and accidental deconditioning is mainly observed within&#xD;
      these particular patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, three categories of patients have been defined according to the invasive nature&#xD;
      of their equipment and therefore according to the risk associated with an unexpected&#xD;
      withdrawal. Finally, presence of patient's family and their adherence to its surveillance&#xD;
      were also implemented into the tool. Main study objective is to jointly investigate&#xD;
      effectiveness and tolerance of a decision-making tool guiding physical restraints use in ICU&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current study has been designed to measure the impact of an original tool intended to guide&#xD;
      the decision to use physical restraints in ICU patients. In a multidisciplinary fashion, we&#xD;
      have created a decision-making tool based on objective criteria in an attempt to reduce&#xD;
      subjectivity that currently exists in this process of physical restraints use. This tool&#xD;
      corresponds to a decision tree based on several criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the RASS (Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale) score that assesses patient's state of&#xD;
           sedation and agitation. This neurological state could help to determine level of arousal&#xD;
           possibly favorizing self-inflicted risks;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the existence of a delirious state (or delirium), assessed by the CAM-ICU (Confusion&#xD;
           Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit). This tool is used to detect and assess&#xD;
           the presence of a delirium. In the case of a positive CAM-ICU, the patient presents a&#xD;
           delirium and may therefore have unsuitable gestures;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the recent modification of pharmacological-induced sedation allows us to take into&#xD;
           account a change in the dosage of infused sedation molecules in order to assess whether&#xD;
           the patient may soon find himself in an awakening phase. This transitional phase makes&#xD;
           patient's neurological state unstable and can lead to agitation and/or confusion;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the level of invasive equipment conditioning, defined by the type of device that equips&#xD;
           the patient. Three levels of conditioning (C1, C2 and C3) have been defined, ranging&#xD;
           from the least to the most harmful in the case of an unexpected removal:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Level C1 includes peripheral venous catheters, naso-gastric tubes and urinary&#xD;
                catheters;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Level C2 includes endotracheal tube, central and arterial lines, renal replacement&#xD;
                catheters, drains: thoracic, encephalic or abdominal; intracranial pressure&#xD;
                sensors, Swan-Ganz catheters, redons, PICC (peripherally inserted central catheter)&#xD;
                lines and Midlines;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Level C3 includes veno-venous and veno-arterial ECMO (extra-corporeal membrane&#xD;
                oxygenation), intra-aortic counter-pulsion balloons and electro-systolic training&#xD;
                probes;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the presence of patient's family and their adherence to his or her supervision. Families&#xD;
           play a key role in patient's care. Their presence might sometimes soothe and reassure&#xD;
           the patient. Their adherence and participation to patient's supervision may allow health&#xD;
           care team to consider adequate compliance. Regular re-evaluation should then be carried&#xD;
           out when they leave patient's room; In order to facilitate the work of caregivers, this&#xD;
           decision-making tool has been transcribed into an electronic version that can be&#xD;
           accessed online, on a tablet or a computer. Once the above criteria have been filled in,&#xD;
           a proposal for whether or not to use physical restraints, as well as main variable&#xD;
           criterion for reassessment of this use. This last criterion makes it possible to know&#xD;
           the decisive factor that suggested the decision to use restraints or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to evaluate the impact of this tool on caregivers' decision to use physical&#xD;
      restraints, three periods have been planned: a control period in order to evaluate actual&#xD;
      practices, a period of training and implementation of the tool, so that each professional is&#xD;
      rendered familiar with its use, and finally an intervention period during which the ARBORea&#xD;
      tool will be used to suggest physical restraints use.&#xD;

    <description>After a period of presentation and training on the dedicated decision-making tool (face-to-face, video and paper supports), nurses will be asked to use ARBORÃ©a decision tree. This will be in the form of an electronic file and will give a suggestion of whether or not to use physical restraints. This is based on an algorithm based on specific and mandatory elements (neurological state : RASS (Richmond assessment sedation scale) and CAM-ICU (confusion assessment method-ICU) scores, modification of sedation dosage, equipment levels, presence and adhesion of the family) that will be completed online. ARBORea's suggestion will be collected as well as final caregiver's decision in order to evaluate relevance of the tool. Observations will also be made at least every 8 hours. This period will also be of random duration (stepped wedge)</description>

    <description>After study presentation and required data collection description, nurses will complete elements related to ARBORea's tool variables, and inform their actual practices of physical restraints use, at least every 8 hours. ARBORea data concern patient's neurological state (RASS and CAM-ICU scores) and changes in sedation doses. The conditioning will then be filled in to stratify the risk incurred. Pain management will be notified. Finally, the presence and involvement of the families will be collected. Other data, relating to working conditions of the nurses will be collected: nurse to patient ratio, special and time consuming events (new patient admission, in ICU emergencies, need to conduct a patient to CT-scan facility or operative room, change of patient's equipment). Nurse seniority in ICU will be specified. Incidents that have occurred (fall, self-injury, removal of a level C2 equipment). The random duration of this control period will be determined by stepped wedge sequencing.</description>
