  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the efficacy and safety of Almonertinib versus placebo following chemoradiation in&#xD;
      patients with stage III unresectable epidermal growth factor receptor mutation-positive&#xD;
      (EGFRm+) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, phase III study to&#xD;
      assess the efficacy and safety of Almonertinib following chemoradiation in patients with&#xD;
      stage III unresectable EGFRm+ NSCLC, including the most common EGFR sensitizing mutations&#xD;
      (Ex19Del and L858R), either alone or in combination with other EGFR mutations (e.g., T790M).&#xD;
      Chemoradiation may have been given either concurrently or sequentially. Patients whose&#xD;
      disease has not progressed following chemoradiation will be randomised within 6 weeks of&#xD;
      completion of chemoradiation to receive Almonertinib or placebo in a 2:1 ratio, and treatment&#xD;
      will be continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or other discontinuation&#xD;
      criteria are met. After progression, patients can be unblinded and may receive open-label&#xD;
      Almonertinib for as long as their treating physician considers they are deriving clinical&#xD;
      benefit.&#xD;
