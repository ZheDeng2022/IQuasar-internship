  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who have severe crowding on the upper jaw that requires two first premolars&#xD;
      extraction will be enrolled in this trial. The different types of brackets, such as&#xD;
      self-ligating brackets and conventional brackets, and the various acceleration methods, such&#xD;
      as corticotomy, have different effects on the orthodontic treatment time and the periodontal&#xD;
      tissues. So, this study will assess and compare the overall leveling and aligning time and&#xD;
      the changes in periodontal indices between patients with severe crowding, treating with&#xD;
      self-ligating brackets associated with flapless corticotomy versus conventional brackets&#xD;
      alone versus self-ligating brackets alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are three groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first group (control group): the patients in this group will be treated using&#xD;
      conventional brackets alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second group (Experimental group): the patients in this group will be treated using&#xD;
      self-ligating brackets alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third group (Experimental group): the patients in this group will be treated using&#xD;
      self-ligating brackets associated with flapless corticotomy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prolonged duration of the treatment period can cause many problems such as caries and&#xD;
      periodontal diseases. The oral environment is considered a suitable environment for many&#xD;
      germs and microorganisms to grow. Any increase in the percentage of these germs predisposes&#xD;
      to the occurrence of dental and periodontal problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have used various procedures and many types of brackets to accelerate dental&#xD;
      movement in order to reduce treatment time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Orthodontic treatment using different devices usually contributes to change the nature of the&#xD;
      oral environment and its contents of microorganisms Many bracket systems have been used, such&#xD;
      as the conventional brackets and self-ligating brackets. The use of self-ligating brackets&#xD;
      has increased significantly in recent years. The absence of wired or elastic elements may&#xD;
      cause less accumulation of plaque.&#xD;
