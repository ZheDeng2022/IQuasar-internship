      The purpose of this study is to study the MRI images of acetabular labrum injury by deep&#xD;
      learning method, and try to establish a combination model of axial and coronal serial images,&#xD;
      and compare with the diagnostic accuracy of radiologists, to establish a deep learning method&#xD;
      for accurate identification and classification of acetabular labrum injury.&#xD;

      1. Detection of acetabular labrum images based on CNN: axial and coronal T2-fs images were&#xD;
           used, and all images were corrected and standardized. CNN is applied to recognize and&#xD;
           learn the images with acetabular labrum to select the images with acetabular labrum&#xD;
           structure from the complete sequence and delete the images without acetabular labrum&#xD;
           structure. All the data are divided into a training set (70%, 30% in training set as&#xD;
           verification set), and the remaining 30% as a test set to evaluate the accuracy of model&#xD;
           recognition. Enter the obtained results into the next step.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Recognition and segmentation of acetabular labrum based on Densenet: using Densenet to&#xD;
           recognize and learn the acetabular labrum from the selected images. LabelImg was used to&#xD;
           locate the acetabular labrum coordinates manually and then input them into Python for&#xD;
           recognition learning. All the data were divided into a training set (70%, and then 30%&#xD;
           in the training set was selected as the verification set), and the remaining 30% was&#xD;
           used as the test set to evaluate the accuracy of model recognition. After identifying&#xD;
           the labrum structure, the labrum structure is locally cut and enlarged to remove the&#xD;
           redundant information. Finally, input the result to the next step.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Identification and grading of acetabular labrum injury based on 3D-CNN: the input data&#xD;
           were identified and graded by the 3D-CNN model. 3D-CNN is divided into eight layers:&#xD;
           input layer, hard wire layer H1, convolution layer C2, downsampling layer S3,&#xD;
           convolution layer C4, downsampling layer S5, convolution layer C6 and output layer.&#xD;
           3D-CNN constructs a cube by stacking multiple consecutive frames and then uses a 3D&#xD;
           convolution kernel in the cube. Through this structure, the feature images in the&#xD;
           convolution layer will be connected with multiple adjacent frames in the previous layer&#xD;
           to realize the information acquisition of continuous images. Similarly, the data were&#xD;
           divided into a training set (70%, and then 30% of the training set was selected as the&#xD;
           verification set), and the remaining 30% was used as the test set to evaluate the&#xD;
           classification accuracy to identify the injury of the labrum and classify the cases with&#xD;
           injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Combination model: according to the above process (1-3), after the models are&#xD;
           established for the axial and coronal images respectively, according to the output&#xD;
           characteristics of the CNN classification model, the probabilities of different grades&#xD;
           are predicted before the output results, and the output results are based on these&#xD;
           probabilities to select the expression form of the maximum possible probability. Our&#xD;
           combination model averages the probabilities of these different classifications,&#xD;
           calculates the final prediction probability, and then obtains the final model. The test&#xD;
           set of the third step (including the mixed data of axial and coronal images) was used to&#xD;
           verify the model.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Comparison of radiologists and deep learning: List the test set cases in the above step&#xD;
           3 and ask two MSK professional radiologists to classify whether there is damage and the&#xD;
           degree of damage, and compared with the results with artificial diagnosis (both doctors&#xD;
           read the images independently and obtained the diagnosis results by simulating the&#xD;
           normal state of writing the report without any prompt). Finally, the accuracy of&#xD;
           artificial diagnosis was compared with that of the combination model obtained in the&#xD;
           fourth step.&#xD;
