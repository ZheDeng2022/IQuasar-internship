  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although whole body vibration (WBV) is mainly designed to promote neuromuscular function,&#xD;
      however, because of its vibration characteristics, whether it can provide additional effects&#xD;
      on the sputum clearance for chronic obstructive pulmonary (COPD) disease patients, thereby&#xD;
      improving the quality of life, and exercise capacity is still unknown.&#xD;

    <description>Subjects received the interventions twice a week for 8 weeks. The HFCWO was delivered by a respiratory therapist using a percussive vest at 10-13 Hz oscillating frequency and at a pressure setting of 2 cm H2O. The treatment duration was 25 minutes, and the participants remained in a sitting position.</description>
