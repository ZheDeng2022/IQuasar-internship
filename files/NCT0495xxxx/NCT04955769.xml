  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study, it was aimed to investigate the relationship between body image, self-stigma,&#xD;
      intuitive eating and exercise attitude levels, which are thought to be effective on the&#xD;
      mental well-being of overweight and obese individuals. For this purpose, the Body Image&#xD;
      Scale, Intuitive Eating Scale-2, Exercise Stages of Change Scale-Short Form and Decisional&#xD;
      Balance Scale in Exercise will be used to assess overweight and obese individuals. 100 people&#xD;
      will be included in the study.&#xD;

    <description>It was developed by Secord and Jourand in 1953, and was adapted to Turkish society after being validated and reliable by Hovardaoğlu in 1989. The scale includes 40 items and each item is related to an organ or a part of the body (such as arm, leg, face) or a function (such as sexual activity level).</description>

    <measure>Intuitive Eating Scale-2</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Intuitive Eating Scale-2 was developed by Tylka and Kroon Van Diest (2013) to measure intuitive eating behaviors. The scale consists of 21 questions and four sub-titles.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Exercise Stages of Change Scale-Short Form</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This 5-optioned scale evaluates the changes of exercise behavior of participants in five stages of pre contemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and consistency. Participants have to select one of the 5 options that evaluate the intention to participate in physical activity and sports now and in the future.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Decisional Balance Scale in Exercise</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The scale is used to measure the individual decision to exercise with 10 questions designed to evaluate exercise beliefs (positive beliefs and obstacles). Participants are asked to choose on a 5-point Likert scale, in what way important every statement was with respect to their intentions to exercise, or not.</description>
