  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intend to explore the efficacy and safety of combined treatment of camrelizumab&#xD;
      and bevacizumab in adult patients with recurrent glioblastoma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is no effective chemotherapy regimen for recurrent glioblastoma. The antiangiogenic&#xD;
      drug bevacizumab has high objective response rate and rapid onset, but the duration of&#xD;
      efficacy needs to be improved.The objective response rate of PD-1 monoclonal antibody&#xD;
      immunotherapy is low and the onset of the effect is slow, but the effective patients have a&#xD;
      long duration of efficacy.The combined treatment of PD-1 monoclonal antibody and bevacizumab&#xD;
      may learn from each other to improve the effective rate, shorten the onset time and prolong&#xD;
      the duration of efficacy.Studies have shown that bevacizumab can enhance the efficacy of&#xD;
      immunotherapy in a variety of cancers, including melanoma, kidney cancer, non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer, and liver cancer.However, previous studies have shown limited efficacy of PD-1&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody combined with bevacizumab in the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the combination therapy was optimized by introducing induction phase therapy,&#xD;
      which is expected to further improve the efficacy. In our previous exploratory treatment of&#xD;
      patients with severe recurrent glioblastoma after multiple treatments, the initial efficacy&#xD;
      was considerable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of camrelizumab [a&#xD;
      programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) inhibitor] combined with bevacizumab for adult patients with&#xD;
      recurrent glioblastoma.&#xD;
