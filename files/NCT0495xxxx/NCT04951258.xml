  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with dementia shows a decline in cognition, such as memory, executive function (EF),&#xD;
      language, attention, and spatial orientation that is significant enough to interfere with the&#xD;
      independence and daily functioning. Previous studies reported that multicomponent exercise&#xD;
      improved EF in people with mild cognitive impairment and independence of ADL in those with&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease. However, few studies investigated whether multicomponent exercise&#xD;
      improved EF, memory, and ADL in people with dementia. Therefore, the purposes of this study&#xD;
      are to examine 1) the effect of multicomponent exercise on EF, memory, and ADL in people with&#xD;
      mild to moderate dementia; 2) the correlation between change in EF and ADL; 3) the&#xD;
      correlation between change in memory and ADL.&#xD;
