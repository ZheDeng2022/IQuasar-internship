  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PROMPT (PONV Rescue Outcomes after AMisulPride Treatment) is an observational Phase IV study&#xD;
      designed to evaluate real-world evidence in relation to the care continuum of Post Operative&#xD;
      Nausea and Vomiting (PONV), as well as the effectiveness and safety of common pharmacologic&#xD;
      rescue treatment regimens compared to IV amisulpride. There will be no predefined hypothesis&#xD;
      regarding the magnitude of efficacy or safety of various treatment regimens from the cohorts&#xD;
      observed. We are not proposing to directly recruit patients into this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Deidentified Electronic Health Record (EHR) information related to treatment of Post&#xD;
      Operative Nausea and Vomiting (PONV) will be collected from academic and community hospitals&#xD;
      throughout the United States. Deidentified EHRs for patients receiving treatment for PONV&#xD;
      will be harvested in two cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1, Rescue treatment according to the standard of care (SOC) at each study site prior&#xD;
      to the introduction of IV amisulpride into clinical practice&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2, Rescue treatment IV amisulpride.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no planned investigational agent, prescribed treatment regimen, or mandated&#xD;
      intervention, and treating clinicians will determine therapy for PONV according to clinical&#xD;
      judgment. The projected inclusion over the course of this observational study is to enroll a&#xD;
      total of 20,000+ patient EHRs evenly divided among those that received SOC and amisulpride&#xD;
      treatment. Effectiveness and safety outcomes will be analyzed using standard statistical&#xD;
      methods for observational studies. Comparison of deidentified patient EHRs in Cohort 1 and&#xD;
      Cohort 2, including response rates, will be compiled and analyzed by an independent medical&#xD;
      data analytics company.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In regard to a Quality Assurance (QA) Plan that addresses data validation and registry&#xD;
      procedures, including any plans for site monitoring and auditing, ArborMetrix performs QA as&#xD;
      part of regular business. QA involves both automation testing and manual testing strategies&#xD;
      including Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), bounds testing and exploratory testing.&#xD;
      Monitoring and auditing is done in line with their continued work toward HITRUST Compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding data checks to compare data entered into the registry against predefined rules for&#xD;
      range or consistency with other data fields in the registry, data validation is built into&#xD;
      the registry configuration based on predefined rules as part of the data analytics and&#xD;
      measures development. When receiving data in a batch, legal values, legal relationships,&#xD;
      primary keys, constraints, duplicates, range, format, length, data type, parent-child&#xD;
      relationship, variable name are all checked at both import and staging. The analytic process&#xD;
      checks naming, ticket #, unit test (Statistical Analysis System (SAS), Structure Query&#xD;
      Language (SQL)), integration, rules, range, consistency, outliers, missing and distribution.&#xD;
      As part of the Risk and Reliability (RR) Adjustment, ArborMetrix checks missing, unique&#xD;
      values, Observed to Expected (OE) ratio, C-stats, R squared and adjusted R squared. Report&#xD;
      validation in the UI (User Interface), which in this case means the registry platform,&#xD;
      compares reporting dictionary to analytic definition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding source data verification and assessing the accuracy, completeness, or&#xD;
      representativeness of registry data, data for PROMPT is being pulled directly from the EMR&#xD;
      system (i.e., external data sources) into the registry. No source data verification will be&#xD;
      conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding Standard Operating Procedures to address registry operations and analysis&#xD;
      activities, such as patient recruitment, data collection, data management, data analysis,&#xD;
      reporting for adverse events, and change management - there is no patient recruitment for&#xD;
      PROMPT. It is an observational study. Information on data collection/management/analysis is&#xD;
      answered in other questions. The change management system involves a Change Management Board,&#xD;
      Change Management Request form outlining event spurring the change, requested date/time,&#xD;
      engineers assigned, devices and/or systems being changed, a description of the change&#xD;
      including technical details, impact, risk validation method and backout plan. The Request is&#xD;
      peer reviewed and approved by leadership and technical personnel prior to implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan for missing data to address situations where variables are reported as missing,&#xD;
      unavailable, non-reported, uninterpretable, or considered missing because of data&#xD;
      inconsistency or out-of-range results - As part of the data integration process, if variables&#xD;
      necessary to meet measure criteria are deemed not available, Acacia will determine the next&#xD;
      steps (i.e., remove measure, change measure criteria, etc.).&#xD;
