  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Incorrect placement of guide pin</measure>
    <time_frame>During operation</time_frame>
    <description>After the subject completes the preparation for guide needle placement (e.g. reduction), a C-arm scan is performed. Get the image. Surgical planning is performed on images. Control robot positioning. The doctor completes the insertion of the guide needle. Then the C-arm scan image was obtained again. Fusion of two groups of images on a third-party software. The deviation distance between the entry and exit points of the guide needle and the surgical plan was measured. The accuracy of guide needle placement was evaluated by the deviation of guide needle placement.</description>
