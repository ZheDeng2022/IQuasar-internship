  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish the safety and tolerability of simultaneous&#xD;
      infusions of 5-Azacytidine and trastuzumab into the fourth ventricle of the brain or&#xD;
      resection cavity in patients with recurrent posterior fossa ependymoma and to assess the&#xD;
      antitumor activity of simultaneous infusions of 5-Azacytidine and trastuzumab into the fourth&#xD;
      ventricle of the brain or resection cavity in patients based upon imaging studies and lumbar&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology.&#xD;

    <description>A new neurological deficit will be defined as new cranial neuropathy, change in level of consciousness, motor weakness, gait change or cerebellar finding (ataxia, dysmetria, dysdiadochokinesis) that is attributed by treating physicians to infusions. New neurological deficits graded as Grade 3 or higher after infusions will be defined as serious adverse events (SAE's)</description>

    <description>Patients will receive once weekly 10 mg intraventricular 5-Azacytidine infusions for six consecutive weeks followed by observation in the infusion suite for a minimum of 30 minutes and once weekly 21 mg intraventricular trastuzumab infusions for six consecutive weeks followed by observation for a minimum of 2 hour after each infusion for the first 2 infusions. During this monitoring period, temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation will be measured. Patients will also have a neurological examination performed to observe for neurological changes. All patients will undergo an MRI of the brain and total spine with and without gadolinium within 7 days after the final 5-AZA and trastuzumab infusion to determine treatment response and to assess for any signal changes in the brain or spine caused by the infusions and they will have a 30 day and a 90 day follow-up assessment by telephone or in person for assessment of outcome measures and safety</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with histologically verified ependymoma, with recurrence or progression&#xD;
             anywhere in the brain and/or spine. Patients are also eligible if they have refractory&#xD;
             disease, which will be defined as residual tumor which has not been completely cleared&#xD;
             despite prior treatments. To be eligible, patients' disease must have originated in&#xD;
             the posterior fossa of the brain&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must have either measurable or evaluable tumor as assessed by MRI of the brain&#xD;
             and total spine&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An implanted catheter in the fourth ventricle or posterior fossa tumor cavity attached&#xD;
             to a ventricular access device or agreement to have one placed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A minimum of 4 weeks between any prior radiation treatments or bevacizumab infusions&#xD;
             and first infusion of 5-azacytidine or trastuzumab infusions. A minimum of 2 weeks&#xD;
             between last dose of any other systemic chemotherapy and first infusion of&#xD;
             5-azacytidine or Trastuzumab into fourth ventricle&#xD;
