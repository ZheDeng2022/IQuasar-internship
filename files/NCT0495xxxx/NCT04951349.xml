      Phase 2b clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intranasal application of&#xD;
      GX-03 as a treatment and prevention for COVID-19. Patients hospitalized with a diagnosis of&#xD;
      mild to moderate COVID-19 will be evaluated for a period of five days. Participating health&#xD;
      care providers will be evaluated for a period of ten days. Swab samples will be collected&#xD;
      from the right and left anterior nostrils at the beginning of the study, as well as three&#xD;
      times per day in the treatment arm for five days. Swab samples will be collected from the&#xD;
      right and left anterior nostrils at the beginning and end of the prevention arm. Samples will&#xD;
      be subjected to biomolecular tests and viral cultures to assess positivity and disease&#xD;
      progression. Safety will be evaluated through standard measures of erythema and edema in the&#xD;
      nasal mucosa.&#xD;
