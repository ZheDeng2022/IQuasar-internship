      This study is a randomized, placebo-controlled and opened, phase 4 clinical trial to evaluate&#xD;
      the safety and immunogenicity of an inactivated COVID-19 vaccine(CoronaVac）in healthy&#xD;
      population aged 18 years and older . The experimental vaccine is manufactured by Sinovac&#xD;
      Research and Development Co.,Ltd. A total of 270 healthy subjects will be enrolled, including&#xD;
      135 adults aged 18-59 years and 135 elderly elderly aged 60 years and older. Subjects in each&#xD;
      age group will be divided into two groups in a ratio of 1:1. Subjects in the experimental&#xD;
      group will receive two doses of CoronaVac on day 0 and day 28. Subjects in the control group&#xD;
      will receive one dose of 23-valent Pneumococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine on day 0 and one dose&#xD;
      of Inactivated Hepatitis A Vaccine on day 28.&#xD;
