      This study aims to build a new multidisciplinary care pathway (BEAUTIFY = BrEast cAncer&#xD;
      qUaliTy of lIfe aFter surgerY) with post-operative follow-up via electronic patient-reported&#xD;
      outcomes of breast cancer surgery complications in order to optimise the quality of life of&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will use focus groups of caregivers and patients treated by surgery for breast&#xD;
      cancer to identify the specific needs of this population and then develop the BEAUTIFY care&#xD;
      pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In oncology, the monitoring of symptoms and treatment toxicities by caregivers is most often&#xD;
      done through hetero-assessments. However, caregivers tend to underestimate them in relation&#xD;
      to what the patient is experiencing. The discrepancy between the measures of side-effects&#xD;
      recorded by the doctor's and patient's measures of side effects has indeed been demonstrated&#xD;
      many times. For the patient's own view of his or her symptoms, health symptoms, health&#xD;
      status, or quality of life (QoL), the (QoL), Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) are increasingly&#xD;
      used in oncology. They are defined as &quot;any measure of the patient's health status reported&#xD;
      directly by the patient, without interpretation by the physician or a third person&quot;. Several&#xD;
      clinical trials have been conducted in recent years to assess the feasibility and value of&#xD;
      collecting PROs in clinical routine in oncology, particularly through the use of electronic&#xD;
      objects (ePROS). Improvements have been shown in the overall survival and QoL of patients&#xD;
      followed by ePROS compared to conventionally followed patients, in patients on chemotherapy&#xD;
      for metastatic cancer and in lung cancer surveillance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breast cancer surgery is responsible for specific acute (infection, haematoma, pain) and&#xD;
      chronic (breast pain, axillary pain, arm pain, allodynia, paresthesia, retractile capsulitis&#xD;
      of the shoulder post-mastectomy syndrome). Acute infections Post-operative infections may&#xD;
      occur in 3 to 19% of 2020 RUBAN ROSE patients, especially after mastectomy. Chronic pain is&#xD;
      reported in up to 70% of patients depending on the series. Post-mastectomy syndrome affects&#xD;
      20 to 50% of patients. These complications may be increased by radiotherapy. Many studies&#xD;
      have shown that all of these chronic complications have a negative impact on the quality of&#xD;
      life of patients and are responsible for depression and/or anxiety, sleep disorders and&#xD;
      difficulties in returning to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, there are specific treatments (PEC) that can reduce these symptoms:&#xD;
      physiotherapy, analgesic medication, analgesic patches, botulinum toxin injections,&#xD;
      psychotherapy, etc. Several studies have shown that the earlier this treatment is undertaken,&#xD;
      the lower the risk of complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is therefore necessary to detect these complications as early as possible in order to&#xD;
      manage them as quickly as possible. A close follow-up of specific symptoms of breast cancer&#xD;
      surgery complications by ePRO could lead to earlier detection and management of these&#xD;
      complications and thus improve patients' pain and quality of life (QoL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to develop an original care pathway focused on the collection of post-surgery&#xD;
      complications in breast cancer via ePROs. The BEAUTIFY programme will be built by a committee&#xD;
      of experts on the basis of reflections carried out within 2 focus groups: a group of 10&#xD;
      patients treated at Nîmes University Hospital for breast cancer; a group of caregivers from&#xD;
      the University Hospitals of Nîmes, Montpellier and the ICM.&#xD;
