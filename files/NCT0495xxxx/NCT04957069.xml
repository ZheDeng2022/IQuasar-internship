  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the surgical outcomes between avulsion fracture of the Achilles tendon and&#xD;
      conventional Achilles tendon rupture, collected and analysed information of patients&#xD;
      preoperatively and postoperatively.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Include 30 patients with avulsion fracture of the Achilles tendon and 30 patients with&#xD;
      Achilles tendon rupture underwent surgical treatment in our institute. Collect and evaluate&#xD;
      MRI, VAS, AOFAS, and FFI score preoperatively and postoperatively. Finally explore the&#xD;
      surgical outcomes between avulsion fracture of the AT and conventional ATR.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>MOCART</measure>
    <time_frame>one year after sugery</time_frame>
    <description>MOCART is a scoring system to evaluate the repair effect of cartilage injury.The minimum and maximum values of MOCART are 100 and 0, respectively. And higher scores mean a better outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>VAS</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-surgery, one year after sugery</time_frame>
    <description>The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) is designed to present to the respondent a rating scale with minimum constraints. Respondents mark the location on the 10-centimeter line corresponding to the amount of pain they experienced. This gives them the greatest freedom to choose their pain's exact intensity. It also gives the maximum opportunity for each respondent to express a personal response style. The minimum and maximum values of VAS are 10 and 0, respectively. And higher scores mean a worse outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>AOFAS</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-surgery, one year after sugery</time_frame>
    <description>The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) Ankle-Hindfoot Score combines subjective scores of pain and function provided by the patient with objective scores based on the surgeon's physical examination of the patient (to assess sagittal motion, hindfoot motion, ankle-hindfoot stability and alignment of the ankle-hindfoot). The scale includes nine items that can be divided into three subscales (pain, function and alignment). The minimum and maximum values of AOFAS are 100 and 0, respectively. And higher scores mean a better outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>FFI</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-surgery, one year after sugery</time_frame>
    <description>A Foot Function Index (FFI) was developed to measure the impact of foot pathology on function in terms of pain, disability and activity restriction. The FFI is a self-administered index consisting of 23 items divided into 3 sub-scales. Both total and sub-scale scores are produced. The FFI was examined for test-retest reliability, internal consistency, and construct and criterion validity. Each scale is from 0 (no pain or difficulty) to 10 (worst pain imaginable or so difficult it required help) .</description>
