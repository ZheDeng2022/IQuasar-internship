      The study aims to describe the current use of dalbavancin in diabetic patients suffering from&#xD;
      infections proven or suspected to be caused by Gram-positive or mixed Gram-positive and&#xD;
      Gram-negative bacteria (with dalbavancin chosen for treating the Gram-positive component) in&#xD;
      Italy and Spain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As overall strategies to reduce the risk of developing severe infections and poor treatment&#xD;
      outcomes among diabetic patients are under-researched and should be explored. This study&#xD;
      could increase the knowledge of infection management among diabetic patients treated with&#xD;
      dalbavancin in order to support appropriate clinical decision-making.&#xD;
