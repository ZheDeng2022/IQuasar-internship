    <textblock>
      Growing concerns about the sustainability and environmental impacts of red meat consumption&#xD;
      have resulted in the increased uptake of plant-based red meat substitutes by consumers&#xD;
      worldwide. In addition to the environmental benefits of these products, it has also been&#xD;
      argued that they have the potential to offer additional health benefits. One such health&#xD;
      benefit, and the focus of this study, is the potential for plant-based meats to produce a&#xD;
      greater satiating effect in comparison to traditional meat products, and therefore&#xD;
      potentially assist in supporting weight loss or weight maintenance in the longer term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address this question, the investigators will assess the effect of substituting V2 mince&#xD;
      for beef mince in a standard pasta meal on both the amount of the meal consumed and on&#xD;
      feelings of fullness in the period after eating, as assessed by both subjective reporting,&#xD;
      objective (biochemical) measures and the amount consumed at a subsequent meal occasion. The&#xD;
      results of this study will provide proof-of-concept evidence of the potential enhanced&#xD;
      satiating effects of V2 mince, and therefore whether it could potentially assist in a weight&#xD;
      reduction dietary regime when substituted for standard beef mince.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will provide preliminary evidence to support whether V2 plant-based mince could&#xD;
      contribute to increased satiety following a meal, which may assist in a weight reduction&#xD;
      dietary regime when substituted for standard beef mince.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators specific hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: That participants will consume less KJ when consuming the V2 plant-based meal in&#xD;
      comparison to the equivalent meal prepared with beef mince.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2: That fullness will be maintained to the same extent following consumption of the V2 and&#xD;
      meat-based meals, such that participants will not increase their consumption at the&#xD;
      subsequent meal period to compensate for this energy deficit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The null hypothesis is that a meal containing V2 plant-based meat is no more satiating than&#xD;
      an equivalent meal containing beef mince.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a single-blinded, randomised cross-over trial, designed to compare the effect&#xD;
      of a meal prepared using V2 plant-based meat to an equivalent meal prepared with beef mince&#xD;
      on the amount consumed in the current meal and objective and subjective measures of&#xD;
      post-prandial satiety. The test meals will be formulated so that the meal will contain 45% of&#xD;
      V2 plant-based meat or beef mince prior to the meal being cooked. Participants will be&#xD;
      provided with a serving that is expected to be in excess of what they would be able to&#xD;
      comfortably eat, and instructed to eat until comfortably full. The amount of the leftovers&#xD;
      will be carefully weighed and used to calculate the volume, energy and macronutrient intake&#xD;
      consumed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      180 mins after lunch (~3 pm), subjects will be presented with a standard cold buffet meal&#xD;
      (including sliced bread, chicken, ham, cheese, mayonnaise, custard, yogurt, fruit salad and&#xD;
      water) in excess of what they are expected to consume and allowed to eat ad libitum for up to&#xD;
      30 minutes. Participants will be asked to eat until they are comfortably full. The amount of&#xD;
      each item consumed will be weighed and used to calculate total volume, energy and&#xD;
      macronutrient intake.&#xD;
