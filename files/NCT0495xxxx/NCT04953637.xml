  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is the most commonly performed surgical treatment for&#xD;
      individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD). DBS typically works best to lessen motor symptoms&#xD;
      such as stiffness, slowness, and tremor. Despite an overall improvement of these motor&#xD;
      symptoms with DBS, past research failed to show an increase in community mobility and have&#xD;
      often reported an increase in falling after surgery. The ability to move around on one's own&#xD;
      is important for functional independence and improved quality of life. There is growing&#xD;
      evidence supporting the positive effects of physiotherapy on individuals with PD. Gait and&#xD;
      balance training, in particular, can improve mobility and also prevent falls. So far, no&#xD;
      study has shown the effectiveness of rehabilitation in patients receiving DBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine if DBS combined with physiotherapy is effective for&#xD;
      improving safe independent mobility in individuals with PD, more so than with patients&#xD;
      receiving DBS alone.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, single-blind randomized controlled study, whereby individuals&#xD;
      receiving DBS will be randomly allocated to receive either physiotherapy or no intervention&#xD;
      in keeping with current practice (control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited from a pool of PD patients who have been identified as candidates&#xD;
      for DBS in the Movement Disorders Clinics at the Toronto Western Hospital. Approximately 60&#xD;
      individuals will be recruited for the study. Study participation will span 9 months from the&#xD;
      time of enrolment to the end of study assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly allocated to one of two groups: 1) physiotherapy, or 2)&#xD;
      control. Participants assigned to the physiotherapy group will receive physiotherapy&#xD;
      treatment at One Step Ahead Mobility physiotherapy clinic for 1-hour per day, 3 times/week&#xD;
      for 8 weeks. Participants assigned to the control group will not receive any additional&#xD;
      intervention and will be precluded from starting formal physiotherapy for the duration of the&#xD;
      study. However, they will be encouraged to keep an active lifestyle. In order to stay active,&#xD;
      they will be recommended to do simple home exercises following a home exercise video that&#xD;
      will be presented to them. Participants assigned to the control group will be assessed at the&#xD;
      same points in time as participants in the physiotherapy group&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants enrolled will undergo a similar timetable with assessments completed at five&#xD;
      points throughout the study period. At month 0, participants are enrolled in the study, have&#xD;
      their baseline assessment completed, and receive DBS surgery. At month 2, participants are&#xD;
      started on optimization of DBS settings. At month 4, DBS settings are optimized and&#xD;
      participants will have completed 7 days of activity monitoring using a wearable before the&#xD;
      pre-intervention assessment. All participants are assessed before the physiotherapy group&#xD;
      begins to receive gait and balance focused physiotherapy for 2 months (8 weeks) and the&#xD;
      control group receives no intervention for 2 months. At month 6, physiotherapy is completed,&#xD;
      and all participants undergo a third assessment immediately after the intervention period. At&#xD;
      month 7, all participants are assessed with a Life Space Assessment questionnaire&#xD;
      post-intervention and will have completed 7 days of activity monitoring using a wearable&#xD;
      before the visit. At month 9, all participants undergo end of study assessment 3 months after&#xD;
      completing physiotherapy.&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcome is the overall amount of independent mobility in the community. This will be measured with the Life Space Assessment (LSA) questionnaire. The LSA is a five-item questionnaire where participants are asked to indicate how often within the previous four weeks they moved within their homes, outside their homes but within their property, within their neighborhoods, within their towns, and outside their towns. LSA is a cross-sectional scale that quantifies the size of one's life space in the past 4 weeks as a score of 0-120 (0 = confined to the bedroom, 120 = daily travel to places outside of one's city/town).</description>

    <description>The Mini Balance Evaluation Systems Test (Mini-BESTest) will be used to measure dynamic balance. The Mini-BESTest is a 14-item test that includes four sections: anticipatory postural adjustments, reactive postural control, sensory orientation, and dynamic gait. Each item is scored from 0-2 (0 indicates that a person is unable to perform the task while a score of 2 is normal).</description>

    <measure>Number of falls and near falls</measure>
    <time_frame>Collected over the 9 months' duration of the study and the diary will be reviewed at visits 2,3,4 and 5.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be provided with a diary on enrolment into the study and will be asked to record any falls and near falls that they experience over the 9 months' duration of the study. A fall is defined as an event that result in a person coming to rest inadvertently on the ground or other lower level not due to a major intrinsic or extrinsic event. If a participant sustains a fall, they will be asked to record the details about the circumstances surrounding the fall with an open-ended questionnaire (setting, activity at the time of fall, physical injury, emergency department visit, hospitalization) in the falls diary. A near fall is defined as stumbling or loss of balance that would result in falling if sufficient recovery mechanisms were not activated. If the participant had a near fall, they will be asked to record the details about the event using the same open-ended questionnaire (setting, activity at the time of near fall, how the fall was avoided) in the diary.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Falls risk and functional mobility</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 1: Baseline assessment at month 0, Visit 2: Pre-intervention assessment at month 4, Visit 3: Post-intervention assessment at month 6, and Visit 5: End of study assessment at month 9</time_frame>
    <description>The Timed Up and Go test (TUG) will be used to assess the falls risk and functional mobility. The TUG test is a physical performance measure in which the ability to rise up from a seated chair position, walk 3m, turn, walk back, and sit down is timed. The TUG test is highly correlated with functional mobility, gait speed, and falls in older adults.</description>

    <time_frame>Visit 1: Baseline assessment at month 0, Visit 2: Pre-intervention assessment at month 4, Visit 3: Post-intervention assessment at month 6, and Visit 5: End of study assessment at month 9</time_frame>
    <description>Exercise and activity levels will be monitored through a set of questions about how much exercise or physical activity they do on a regularly. For the intensity of the activity, they will be asked to separate how much time they spend doing vigorous, moderate, and light activity.</description>

    <description>Health-related quality of life will be assessed using the 39-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39). The PDQ-39 asks participants to rate how often they encounter difficulty on items within eight subscales: mobility, activities of daily living, emotional well-being, stigma, social support, cognition, communication, and bodily discomfort.</description>

    <description>Parkinson's disease symptoms will be evaluated with the Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) part 3 scores. The maximum total MDS-UPDRS score for part 3 ranges from 0 to 132. Higher scores indicate a worse outcome of Parkinson's disease.</description>
