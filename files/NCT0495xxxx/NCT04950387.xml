      Forty-six endurance runners, 23 males (age = 16.4±1.1) and 23 females (age=16.8±1.1)&#xD;
      participated in our study. The contribution of abdominal, thoracic, and subclavian&#xD;
      musculature to respiration and ventilation parameters during three different intensities on a&#xD;
      cycle ergometer was assessed pre- and post-intervention.&#xD;

      Subjects Forty six distance runners (14-18 years) participated in our study, 23 males (age =&#xD;
      16.4±1.1, height = 177.1±5.8 cm, weight = 62.4±5.8 kg) and 23 females (age = 16.8±1.1, height&#xD;
      = 168.5±4.4 cm, weight = 55.9±4.0 kg). All participants reported a history of endur-ance&#xD;
      running of at least six times a week for the past year. Participants were randomly al-located&#xD;
      to an experimental group (n=23), which took part in an eight-week breathing in-tervention, or&#xD;
      a control group (n=23), which continued training but did not carry out any breathing&#xD;
      exercises. One participant did not complete the intervention for medical rea-sons, so was&#xD;
      excluded from the study. The two groups, both experimental and control, followed the same&#xD;
      training program, the only difference being that the experimental group performed breathing&#xD;
      exercises. A randomization sequence has been generated using Randomization.org. An&#xD;
      independent person not involved in this study made the comput-er-generated randomization&#xD;
      sequence. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the local Ethics Committee on&#xD;
      October 19, 2018 (002/2018) and followed the guidelines of the World Medical Assembly&#xD;
      Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent to partic-ipate was provided by guardians&#xD;
      and verbal assessment was provided by the partici-pants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design We evaluated ventilatory musculature involvement in three basic areas using a&#xD;
      muscle dynamometer MD03 as previously described. The device is a four-channel digital muscle&#xD;
      dynamometer that, by design, al-lows instantaneous values of muscle force to be measured in&#xD;
      relation to time (i.e., both the force size and its dynamics can be evaluated). In general,&#xD;
      different muscles and muscle groups on the human body can be measured. MD03 is made up of&#xD;
      four muscle probes (we used three probes) that attach themselves to the human body with&#xD;
      belts. The probes contain a strain transducer to a digital signal that is transmitted to a&#xD;
      microprocessor evalua-tion unit that adjusts digital signals from the probes into a&#xD;
      compatible form with a USB input to a notebook. Two software levels (SW1 and SW2) are part of&#xD;
      MD03. Probe attachment sites were selected based on the kinematics of the aforementioned&#xD;
      thoracic sectors. The first probe was placed in the lower respiratory sector on the ventral&#xD;
      side of the level L4-5. In the middle wind sector at the level of 8.-9. ribs, on the ventral&#xD;
      side below the sternum, a second probe was placed. A third level probe was placed in the&#xD;
      upper respiratory sector 3.-4. ribs on the ventral side in the sternal area. Chest&#xD;
      compression and expansion during respiration change the force applied to the individual&#xD;
      sensors in the attached belt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inspiratory and expiratory forces exerted on individual probes located in the given breathing&#xD;
      sectors were recorded for 60-sec and minute averages were determined for each probe. After&#xD;
      60-sec of resting data acquisition using spontaneous breathing and deep breathing,&#xD;
      participants underwent an incremental test on a cycle ergometer (Lode, Gro-ningen, The&#xD;
      Netherlands) and oxygen consumption, tidal volume, respiratory rate and minute ventilatory&#xD;
      volume were continuously monitored (Metalyzer B3, Cortex, Leipzig, Germany). The testing&#xD;
      protocol was made relative to participant body weight (i.e., W·kg-1) and began with a 4-min&#xD;
      stage at 1 W·kg-1 followed by three, two-minute stages at progres-sive intensities (2, 3, 4&#xD;
      W·kg-1) and cadence was standardized to 95-100 rev·min-1. Ventilatory muscular involvement of&#xD;
      the abdominal, thoracic, and subclavian body sectors was monitored during the last minute of&#xD;
      each of the three submaximal intensities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The training program lasted eight weeks. The experimental group performed breath-ing&#xD;
      exercises daily. In the first week of the breathing intervention, training of breathing&#xD;
      ex-ercises took place in the form of three supervised as group breathing sessions. In the&#xD;
      following weeks, there were always two group training sessions, each last ~30 minutes. They&#xD;
      practiced right on the schedule. On unsupervised days, participants were asked to perform&#xD;
      exercises individually at home for at least 10 minutes. Information about the length of each&#xD;
      individuals training session was recorded in a diary by the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The set of breathing exercises was based on yoga, the aim was to activate the dia-phragm and&#xD;
      become aware of individual breathing sectors. As such, breath training in-cluded a variety of&#xD;
      exercises such as breathing wave training, full breathing (breathing in-to all sectors) and&#xD;
      paced breathing (breathing in a specified rhythm). The exercises were performed in various&#xD;
      positions, including lying down, sitting in the kneeling position, sit-ting, kneeling, and&#xD;
      standing. All breathing was performed through the nose. At the begin-ning of the&#xD;
      intervention, the participants breathed spontaneously, later switching to pro-longing the&#xD;
      inspiratory and expiratory phases. They started with a 1: 1 ratio of inhale to exhale length.&#xD;
      Gradually, the pre-exhalation and pre-exhalation phases of breath holding were included:&#xD;
      inspiration - 6 periods, holding breath - 3 periods, exhaling - 6 periods, holding breath - 3&#xD;
      periods. Each of the participants adapted the exercise to their individual respiratory rate.&#xD;
      Each of the exercises was repeated 6 times. The exercises were slow, with a deep focus on&#xD;
      breathing, in line with the movement. Very important was the perception of the direction of&#xD;
      movement and expansion of the chest, the behavior of the axis of the body (head, spine,&#xD;
      pelvis), which they learned during the introductory meetings. The control group did not&#xD;
      participate in any form of breathing training and were told to go about their lives as usual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follow-up testing, which was the same as the aforementioned described graded maximal test&#xD;
      on the cycle ergometer, was performed after 8 weeks of intervention. The control group was&#xD;
      always tested at the same time as the members of the intervention group.&#xD;
