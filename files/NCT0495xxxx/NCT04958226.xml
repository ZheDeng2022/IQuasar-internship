  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, fixed-sequence study to evaluate the effect of capivasertib on the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of midazolam, a sensitive CYP3A substrate. The PK of midazolam will be&#xD;
      assessed when administered alone and in combination with repeated doses of capivasertib.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is 2 part study: Part A and Part B. Part A of the study consists of a screening period&#xD;
      and 3 treatment periods (midazolam alone, capivasertib alone, and midazolam + capivasertib).&#xD;
      During Part A, the PK profile of midazolam will be determined with and without capivasertib.&#xD;
      Participants who complete Part A without disease progression and unacceptable toxicity will&#xD;
      proceed to Part B. Part B of the study consists of an extended treatment period with&#xD;
      capivasertib alone, followed by a 30-day safety follow-up.&#xD;
