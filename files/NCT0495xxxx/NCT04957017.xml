  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was conducted in order to inform, the women with chronic disease in rural areas,&#xD;
      about hand-washing and nutrition, and to evaluate the efficiency of the training program. A&#xD;
      randomized-controlled trial was performed based on CONSORT checklist. 90 women in total were&#xD;
      included in the study, 45 for each group. The women in the intervention group were given, by&#xD;
      the researcher, the training on the importance of hand-washing and appropriate food choices.&#xD;
      The training given to the women in rural areas created significant benefit for them to have&#xD;
      the appropriate food choices and hand-washing behaviours.&#xD;

    <measure>The Nutritional Knowledge Level Scale for Adults (NKLSA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Three months</time_frame>
    <description>The Nutritional Knowledge Level Scale for Adults (NKLSA) developed by Batmaz in 2018 and whose validity and reliability were studied, the 20 statements under the heading &quot;Basic Nutritional and Food-Health Knowledge&quot; and 12 statements under the heading &quot;Food Choice&quot; were responded using one of the following: strongly agree, agree, neither agree nor disagree, disagree, and strongly disagree. The participants who responded the inappropriate statements by &quot;strongly agree&quot; got 0 point; those who &quot;agreed&quot; with these statements got 1 point; those who neither agreed nor disagreed got 2 points; those who disagreed got 3 points, and those who strongly disagreed with them got 4 points. The maximum score that can be obtained from the &quot;Basic Nutritional and Food-Health Knowledge&quot; is 80, and the maximum score to be obtained from the &quot;Food Choice&quot; is 48.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Social Hand-Washing Knowledge Form</measure>
    <time_frame>Three months</time_frame>
    <description>Social Hand-Washing Knowledge Form was created by the researchers by scanning the literature (Kilpatrick et al., 2018; Lynch et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2013), and the authors received expert opinions from 3 academic members for the content validity of the knowledge statements. The answers given to the questions were scored as No &quot;0&quot;, Occasionally &quot;1&quot;, Yes &quot;2&quot;. Question 11 included in the investigators survey was reversely scored. The lowest score to be obtained from the investigators survey was 0 and the highest score was 22. As the investigators considered it more comprehensible to convert this score into a hundred scale and make the investigators evaluations over 100 points, the investigators evaluated the total score obtained by each case through converting it into a hundred scale.</description>

    <description>The women with chronic disease were met, and the Descriptive Information Form, Social Hand-Washing Knowledge Form and the &quot;Nutritional Knowledge Level Scale for Adults&quot; were filled with the volunteer ones face-to-face at their homes, complying with the social distance rules before the training. After the data was collected, the women in the intervention group were trained on &quot;Hand-Washing and Nutrition during the COVID-19 period&quot;. The training on hand-washing and nutrition was given using the &quot;Hand-Washing and Nutrition Training Guide&quot; prepared by the researchers, and the &quot;Hand-Washing and Nutrition Training Manual&quot; covering the content of the training, was distributed to the women at the end of the training. The data collection forms were re-filled three months after the training.</description>

    <description>The women with chronic disease were met, and the Descriptive Information Form, Social Hand-Washing Knowledge Form and the Nutritional Knowledge Level Scale for Adults were filled face-to-face at their homes with the ones volunteering to participate in the study, complying with the social distance rules. The same survey was re-filled after three months. No training was given to the women with chronic disease during the three-month period. After the research was completed, a 45 minute-training which is the same with the one provided to the intervention group was given individually to the control group, complying the social distance rules.</description>
