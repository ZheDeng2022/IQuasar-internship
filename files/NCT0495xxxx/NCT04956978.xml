  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a pilot analysis using a decision on the risk and benefits of oral&#xD;
      anticoagulation for stroke reduction for patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. This&#xD;
      study is a feasibility and acceptability analysis but will also measure preliminary&#xD;
      effectiveness measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator hypothesizes that a patient decision support tool will increase decision&#xD;
      quality and secondarily increase the use of oral anticoagulation in Black patients with&#xD;
      non-valvular atrial fibrillation.&#xD;
