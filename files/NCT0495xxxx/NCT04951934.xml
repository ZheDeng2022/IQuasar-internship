      This clinical trial will be a multi-centric prospective, randomized controlled study with the&#xD;
      commercial objective of evaluating the clinical efficacy of a battery-powered portable device&#xD;
      that uses blue LEDs. The clinical study aims to compare the existing standard treatment for&#xD;
      burned areas in which the autologous skin graft was not successful, with a protocol that&#xD;
      includes the administration of the treatment with EmoLED for 5 consecutive weeks in addition&#xD;
      to conventional therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The enrolled patients will have to be examined after 5 weeks of treatment, until complete&#xD;
      healing and subsequently their scarring will have to be evaluated at 3 and 6 months after&#xD;
      healing.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Burns are the fourth most common type of trauma in the world, after traffic accidents, falls&#xD;
      and personal violence. Around 11 million people worldwide used medical treatment for burns in&#xD;
      2004. The risk of burns increases with the lowering of the socioeconomic status. Of these&#xD;
      burn victims, about 2% need hospitalization and about 0.5% need to be hospitalized in&#xD;
      specialized centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In deep burns, the surgical procedure of autologous skin transplant (autograft) is almost&#xD;
      always the preferred way to induce a re-epithelization of the injured area. The coverage of a&#xD;
      deep burn with the graft is -depending on the case case- immediate, delayed a few days after&#xD;
      excision or late, after a first phase of direct scarring. Numerous are the types of surgery&#xD;
      as well as the sites of skin removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The autologous graft, however, presents a not negligible probability of failure that leads to&#xD;
      the total or partial detachment of the grafted skin; when this happens the healing process of&#xD;
      the lesion (or a part of it) uncovered occurs by second intention but is not always easy to&#xD;
      manage, as this process can be delayed or stopped by many factors. Known factors contributing&#xD;
      to this are, for example, diabetes, infections, metabolic deficiencies and the advanced age&#xD;
      of the subject, while others are still being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, proper wound management and dressing after surgery, trauma or disease is an&#xD;
      important part of the healing process, not only to prevent the onset of infections or other&#xD;
      complications, but also to accelerate wound healing itself with as little scarring as&#xD;
      possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical study will be a multi-centric prospective, randomized controlled parallel&#xD;
      group, superiority study, with the commercial objective of evaluating the clinical efficacy&#xD;
      of a battery-powered portable device that uses blue LEDs. The Study aims, within the planned&#xD;
      observation weeks, to clinically compare two groups of patients with deep burn injuries whose&#xD;
      autologous skin graft has failed in part or totally. The objective is to determine any&#xD;
      differences in outcome between the two groups considered and whether the therapy of the&#xD;
      treatment group is a valid alternative to the current therapy in terms of reactivation and&#xD;
      support of the reparative process, speed of healing and scarring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1, the &quot;Control&quot; group, will follow the standard treatment provided by the hospital&#xD;
      protocol; Group 2, the &quot;Treated&quot; one, will follow the standard treatment provided by the&#xD;
      hospital protocol to which is added the treatment with the EmoLED device, scheduled between&#xD;
      the cleansing and the dressing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The measurement of the difference in efficacy of the device between the two arms will be&#xD;
      evaluated in terms of reactivation of the healing process, intended as the achievement of a&#xD;
      re-epithelialization of at least 30%, speed (time) of healing and scarring (Vancouver scale).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical trial in question aims, therefore, to investigate whether the group of patients&#xD;
      undergoing standard therapy with, in addition, the treatment with EmoLED reaches a higher&#xD;
      percentage of reactivations of the healing process than the one of the control group,&#xD;
      subjected to standard treatment. If confirmed, this result would imply significant gains in&#xD;
      terms of speeding up hospital stay for those patients where autologous grafts have not been&#xD;
      successful, therefore also in terms of reducing public health expenditure, not to mention&#xD;
      that, if the improvement of scarring results were confirmed in the Treated group, it would&#xD;
      increase the quality of life of patients with burn scars which often significantly impact on&#xD;
      this parameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population subject of this trial is widely representative of the target population, as&#xD;
      there are no particular exclusion criteria and the sites involved are structures of&#xD;
      excellence in the treatment of burns and failed skin grafting areas.&#xD;
