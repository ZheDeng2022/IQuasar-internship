  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, first-in-human (Phase IIa) study designed to assess the safety (and&#xD;
      efficacy) of Aurase Wound Gel, an enzymatic debridement product, intended for topical&#xD;
      application to sloughy venous leg ulcers (VLU).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study has been designed as a dose escalation study, and will serially explore increasing&#xD;
      concentrations of the Aurase enzyme in a relevant patient population. Five cohorts (of 10&#xD;
      patients each, except cohort 1 with 5 patients), will receive standard of care supplemented&#xD;
      with increasing concentrations of Aurase and will be assessed for clinical tolerability at&#xD;
      the wound site, systemic safety and efficacy (extent of wound debridement) over a period of 4&#xD;
      weeks. Patients will receive a total of 12 doses of Aurase Wound Gel. At the end of the&#xD;
      study, patients will revert to standard of care only.&#xD;
