  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability-adjusted life-years worldwide.&#xD;
      Carotid high-risk atherosclerotic plaques are considered to be one of the major sources of&#xD;
      ischemic stroke. The present study aimed to investigate the relationship of carotid plaque&#xD;
      characteristics with brain perfusion and cognitive function in patients undergoing carotid&#xD;
      endarterectomy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cerebrovascular disease is the first cause of death and adult disability in China. More than&#xD;
      75% of the patients in China have ischemic cerebrovascular disease, and about 33.3% of them&#xD;
      have ipsilateral extracranial carotid stenosis. One of the main causes of carotid stenosis is&#xD;
      atherosclerosis. Atherosclerotic plaques can be divided into two types: stable plaques and&#xD;
      vulnerable plaques. Vulnerable plaque has the tendency to rupture, prone to thrombosis and&#xD;
      rapid progression of dangerous plaque. Its pathological characteristics are mainly as&#xD;
      follows: thin fibrous cap (or fibrous cap has been broken), large lipid nucleus, massive&#xD;
      hemorrhage in plaque, rich in inflammatory cells, abundant neovascularization and plaque&#xD;
      surface calcification. Vulnerable plaque is the main cause of stroke. At present,&#xD;
      high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging combined with multi sequence is one of the best&#xD;
      methods to evaluate carotid artery stenosis, which is helpful to analyze plaque&#xD;
      characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, the main treatment methods of carotid artery stenosis are: carotid endarterectomy&#xD;
      (CEA) and carotid angioplasty with stenting (CAS). Large scale multicenter prospective&#xD;
      randomized trials and meta-analysis have established CEA as the gold standard for the&#xD;
      treatment of carotid arerosclerotic stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have shown that the ipsilateral cerebral perfusion is continuously decreased due to&#xD;
      carotid artery stenosis, and CEA operation can relieve the vascular stenosis and improve the&#xD;
      cerebral perfusion. However, the relationship between cerebral perfusion improvement after&#xD;
      CEA and the quantitative characteristics of vulnerable plaque is still lack of sufficient&#xD;
      evidence. Vascular cognitive impairment is closely related to the progress of carotid&#xD;
      stenosis. The main mechanisms are microemboli formation, white matter injury and central&#xD;
      nervous function decline caused by long-term chronic hypoperfusion. The formation and&#xD;
      continuous hypoperfusion of microemboli further increase the burden of white matter disease.&#xD;
      Studies have shown that the visual spatial executive ability, naming ability, attention&#xD;
      ability and abstract profile ability of patients after CEA are significantly improved.&#xD;
      However, there is still insufficient evidence about the relationship between the MRI features&#xD;
      of vulnerable carotid plaques and the improvement of cognitive function after CEA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hope to achieve the following goals: 1) to explore the associations between carotid&#xD;
      vulnerable plaque characteristics and cerebral perfusion in patients undergoing CEA; 2) to&#xD;
      explore the associations between the characteristics of vulnerable carotid plaques and&#xD;
      cognitive function in patients undergoing CEA.&#xD;
