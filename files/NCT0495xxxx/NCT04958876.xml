  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SP-104 relative to&#xD;
      naltrexone immediate release capsules in healthy adults. The study is designed to test the&#xD;
      hypothesis that the formulation of SP-104 will mitigate against adverse events associated&#xD;
      with naltrexone.&#xD;
