  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of Seltorexant as&#xD;
      adjunctive therapy to an antidepressant in adolescents with major depressive disorder (MDD)&#xD;
      in the short-term compared with placebo.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of major depression is approximately 4 percentage (%) to 8% in adolescents,&#xD;
      with the highest incidence of MDD in child onset depression occurring during mid- to late&#xD;
      adolescence (that is, 14 to 18 years of age). Seltorexant (JNJ-42847922) is a potent and&#xD;
      selective antagonist of the human orexin-2 receptor (OX2R) that is being developed for the&#xD;
      treatment of adjunctive treatment of MDD with insomnia symptoms (MDDIS).The study will be&#xD;
      conducted in 3 phases: a screening phase (up to 30 days prior to first dose administration),&#xD;
      a double-blind (DB) treatment phase (6 weeks), and a follow-up phase (up to 2 weeks including&#xD;
      a telephone consult and on-site follow-up visit. The total study duration for each&#xD;
      participant will be up to 12 weeks. Efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, and biomarkers will&#xD;
      be assessed at specified time points during this study. The hypothesis for this study is that&#xD;
      the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics in the adolescent MDD population. There is no&#xD;
      formal statistical hypothesis testing due to the exploratory and descriptive nature of this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline to Week 6 in Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in MADRS score will be reported. The 10-item MADRS is a clinician-administered scale designed to measure depression severity and detects changes due to antidepressant treatment. The test consists of 10 items, each of which is scored from 0 (item not present or normal) to 6 (severe or continuous presence of the symptoms), for a total score of 60. Higher score represents a more severe condition.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Clinical Global Impression- severity (CGI-S) Score Over Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline over time in the CGI-S score will be reported. The CGI-S provides an overall clinician-determined summary measure of the severity of the participant's illness. The CGI-S evaluates the severity of psychopathology on a scale of 1 to 7. Considering total clinical experience with the depression population, a participant is assessed on severity of illness at the time of rating according to: 1=normal (not at all ill); 2=borderline ill; 3=mildly ill; 4=moderately ill; 5=markedly ill; 6=severely ill; 7=among the most extremely ill participants.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline to Week 6/EOT on Subjective Sleep Assessment (Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System-Pediatric-Sleep Disturbance [PROMIS-Pediatric-SD] [Short Form 8a])</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline to week 6/EOT on subjective sleep assessment (PROMIS-Pediatric-SD [short form 8a]) will be reported. The PROMIS-SD is used to assess self-reported perceptions of sleep quality, sleep depth and restoration associated with sleep. The full PROMIS-SD includes 27 items with each item based on a 7-day recall period and assessed on a 5 level Likert-type scale. The 8-item short form will be used in this study, in which responses are scored 1 to 5 for each item. A higher score on 5 of the 8 items reflects a worse outcome, whereas a higher score on 3 items reflects an improved outcome; therefore, the directionality of the 8 item scores is first synchronized prior to calculation of the total raw score. To find the total raw score for a short form with all questions answered, sum the values of the response to each question. Higher overall score indicates more sleep disturbance.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive Performance on a Neurocognitive Battery at Baseline and Week 6/EOT</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The cogstate computerized cognitive battery is a validated set of assessments which will be performed to assess verbal learning and memory and evaluate cognitive function. The battery will provide assessment of multiple cognitive domains, including attention, visual learning and memory, and executive function. All measures in the cognitive battery have been validated against traditional neuropsychological tests and are sensitive to the effects of various drugs on cognitive performance, including alcohol and benzodiazepines. The participants completed Cogstate computerized cognitive battery has been used for cognitive assessment in several child and adolescent research trials including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and demonstrates good reliability and validity in child and adolescent populations. The ISLT has also been used in adolescent trials, demonstrating sensitivity, reliability and validity.</description>
