    <textblock>
      Study CC-91633-AML-001 is a Phase 1, open-label, dose escalation and expansion,&#xD;
      first-in-human (FIH) clinical study of CC-91633 (BMS-986397) in participants with relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory acute myeloid leukemia (R/R AML) or in participants with relapsed or refractory&#xD;
      higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (R/R HR-MDS). The Dose Escalation part (Part A) of the&#xD;
      study will enroll participants with R/R AML and R/R HR-MDS and will evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of escalating doses of CC-91633 (BMS-986397), administered orally, and determine&#xD;
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or preliminary recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) and schedule.&#xD;
      Throughout the study, final decisions on dose escalation/de-escalation will be made by the&#xD;
      safety review committee (SRC). Approximately 40 participants may be enrolled in Part A of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expansion part (Part B) will confirm tolerability of the selected doses and schedules and&#xD;
      evaluate whether efficacy is in a range that warrants further clinical development. Separate&#xD;
      expansion cohorts for participants with R/R AML and R/R HR-MDS may enroll approximately 20 to&#xD;
      40 response evaluable participants per cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parts A and B will consist of 3 periods: Screening, Treatment, and Follow-up.&#xD;
