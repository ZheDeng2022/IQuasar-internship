  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Labor induction is a common medical technique. There is no consensus on which technique is&#xD;
      better than the others. Misoprostol is an analogue of Prostaglandin E1 previously used&#xD;
      off-label in labor induction. Its low cost, room-temperature storage, and diverse route&#xD;
      options have made it an alternative to PGE2 in labor induction. As of 2018, oral misoprostol&#xD;
      25 μg tablet was licensed for labor induction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Very few studies have been performed on oral misoprostol 25 μg and none compared it with the&#xD;
      PGE2s mostly used in induction on unfavorable cervix at term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators compared the safety and the efficacy between the oral misoprostol 25 μg&#xD;
      Angusta® used since 20/02/2020 and the vaginal dinoprostone previously used in gel or&#xD;
      diffuser over two consecutive periods from 01/01/2019 to 19/02/2020 for the dinoprostone and&#xD;
      from 20/02/2020 to 07/04/2021 for the misoprostol.&#xD;

    <description>In period 1, the service protocol for induction at term on an unfavorable cervix indicated the use of a PGE2. In nulliparous women, Propess® was introduced intra-vaginally for 24 hours or until regular painful uterine contractions occurred. In the case of a multiparous woman, Prostine® gel, one or two mg depending on the cervical conditions at the time of induction, was introduced intravaginally and the cervix was reassessed after six hours. If the cervix remained unfavorable and the kinetics of the contractions were not optimal, a new dose of Prostine® one or two mg was administered to the patient.</description>

    <description>In period 2, patients who were induced with an unfavorable cervix at term were induced with misoprostol. Regardless of parity, the patient received oral misoprostol 25 μg, one tablet orally every two hours until a maximum of eight tablets per day, or 200 µg, was reached, with cessation of the tablets when painful, regular contractions were obtained.</description>
