  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PURPOSE: The purpose of the study is to determine the effects of 12-weeks of exercise&#xD;
      training on physical reserve, as measured by aerobic capacity, strength and physical&#xD;
      function, in patients with CLL. Further, it is our aim to assess relationships with changes&#xD;
      in physical reserve and resilience to the patient's cancer, as measured by immune cell&#xD;
      counts, tumor cell killing and antibacterial functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN: Subjects will have confirmed treatment naïve CLL. Subjects will be assigned to either&#xD;
      a 12-week control (no supervised exercise) or an intervention (HIIT) group. Before and after&#xD;
      the 12 week program subjects will undergo several tests including: 1) a maximal treadmill&#xD;
      test, 2) body composition, 3) muscle strength and endurance, 4) physical activity levels, 5)&#xD;
      blood measures (e.g. immune and inflammatory functions). Subjects in the HIIT group will&#xD;
      complete a 12-week supervised exercise training program consisting of HIIT and strength&#xD;
      training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA ANALYSES &amp; SAFETY ISSUES: This is a pilot study, with the goal of assessing whether&#xD;
      exercise training causes a change in aerobic fitness (VO2peak), muscle function, and&#xD;
      immunological measures. Vo2peak will be measured by a cardiopulmonary exercise test, muscle&#xD;
      function will be measured by strength tests, and immunological functions will be measured&#xD;
      from blood samples. For outcomes, group change differences from baseline to 12-weeks will be&#xD;
      compared by ANCOVA. The data will be used to provide power calculations for future grant&#xD;
      proposals. High Intensity Interval Training is a very safe exercise modality. The regular use&#xD;
      of vigorous intensity exercise intervals have been used extensively in exercise training. In&#xD;
      fact, the exercise intervals will start at levels lower and will be of shorter duration than&#xD;
      were used during the maximal exercise test. They will then be carefully and slowly made to be&#xD;
      more challenging as each subject is able to safely tolerate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS: The investigators hypothesize that HIIT will be a feasible exercise intervention&#xD;
      for people with CLL and will result in improvements in markers of health and fitness.&#xD;

    <description>Subjects will undergo supervised exercise training 3 x per week for 12 weeks. Three/sessions per week will consist of intervals of high-intensity (~85% of maximal capacity) will be 5 to 10 bouts of 30 seconds at this intensity with rest periods in between intervals that range from 30 seconds to 2 minutes. Following this, on 2 occasions/week subjects will complete muscular endurance resistance training on machine weights.</description>
