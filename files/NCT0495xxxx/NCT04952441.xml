  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the RISE program has a significant impact&#xD;
      on nurses' resilience, insight, self-compassion, and empowerment, as well as mental and&#xD;
      physical well-being, in their personal lives and their working environment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will include the face-to-face visits of eight weekly 90-minute psychoeducational&#xD;
      group sessions in a private conference room at AdventHealth. No absences are permitted due to&#xD;
      lack of engagement. Participants will only be compensated for the number of attended&#xD;
      sessions. The LMHC facilitator will send a reminder email to the control group participants&#xD;
      after the intervention group participants attend their eighth session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be three unpaid optional follow-up monthly booster sessions that focus on skill&#xD;
      development. Participants will be invited to attend these booster sessions during the 3&#xD;
      months following their group's RISE Program. Attendance will be recorded. No other data will&#xD;
      be collected during the booster sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following assessments will be used to measure study outcomes: Brief Resilience Scale&#xD;
      (BRS); Self-Reflection and Insight Scale (SRIS); Self-Compassion Scale - Short Form (SCS-SF);&#xD;
      Psychological Empowerment Instrument (PEI); Stress Mindset Measure - General (SMM-G);&#xD;
      Perceived Stress Survey (PSS); Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI); Public Health Surveillance -&#xD;
      Wellbeing Scale (PHS-WB); RAND MOS Sleep Scale Survey; RAND 36-Item Short Form Health Survey&#xD;
      (SF-36); World Health Organization Health and Work Performance questionnaire (WHO-HPQ); and&#xD;
      Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) questionnaire. In addition, demographic&#xD;
      assessments will be collected. Employment with AdventHealth will also be tracked&#xD;
      longitudinally at 12 months with Human Resources.&#xD;
