      Multicenter Phase I-II clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part I: 14-patients will receive an open-label 500 μl subcutaneous injection via needle and&#xD;
      syringe of the study IMP (CoVac-1). 28 days following vaccination of the&#xD;
&#xD;
      1th patient, there will be an interim analysis of safety and immunogenicity and a review by&#xD;
      the data safety monitoring board (DSMB) before proceeding to Phase II Definition of&#xD;
      sufficient immunogenicity after one dose of vaccination: T cell response to at least one&#xD;
      CoVAC-1 vaccine peptide on day28 in ≥80% of study patients, with proven general ability to&#xD;
      mount antigen-specific T cell responses (detection of T cell responses to EBV/CMV control&#xD;
      peptides) assessed by Interferon gamma (IFN-γ) ELISpot.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The time point (day28) for the assessment of CoVac-1 induced T cell responses was&#xD;
           selected based on the results of the ongoing P-pVAC-SARS-CoV-2 study, where&#xD;
           CoVac-1-induced SARS-CoV-2 T cell responses were observed in 100% of study subjects at&#xD;
           day28.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The threshold of 80% was introduced after considering recent findings about cancer&#xD;
           patients with hematological malignancies (comprising patients with B cell or antibody&#xD;
           deficiencies) vaccinated with BNT162b2. Here it was observed that only 50% of patients&#xD;
           had a BNT162b2-induced T cell response, while this was achieved in 80% of the healthy&#xD;
           donors. Thus, the threshold of 80% was chosen, with the aim of providing our study&#xD;
           population an immunization comparable to the one achieved in the healthy population&#xD;
           vaccinated with the approved vaccines. CoVac-1 induced T cell responses are defined as&#xD;
           positive T cell response in Interferon gamm (IFN-γ) ELISPOT assay with spot count at&#xD;
           least 2-fold higher than the baseline assay (Visit 1). T cell responses are considered&#xD;
           to be positive when the mean spot count per well is at least 3-fold higher than the mean&#xD;
           number of spots in the negative control wells (stimulated with a control peptide). Only&#xD;
           patients with detectable T cell response to the viral peptide panel ex vivo or after in&#xD;
           vitro T cell expansion, and thus general ability to mount an antigen-specific immune&#xD;
           response will be considered for the evaluation of sufficient immune responses after one&#xD;
           CoVac-1 vaccination. Part II (optional): If there is an insufficient immune response&#xD;
           measured by Interferon gamma (IFN-γ) ELISpot in Part I of Phase I on day 28, an&#xD;
           additional Part (Part II) of Phase I will start enrollment of 14 subjects receiving two&#xD;
           open-label 500 μl subcutaneous injection via needle and syringe of the study IMP&#xD;
           (CoVac-1) on day1 and day42.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II (after an amendment to the protocol):&#xD;
&#xD;
      40 subjects will receive an open-label 500 μl subcutaneous injection via needle and syringe&#xD;
      of the study IMP (CoVac-1) on d1 and, depending on the data collected in Phase I, a second&#xD;
      vaccination on day42 if necessary.&#xD;
