  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that chronic insufficient sleep is associated with diminished&#xD;
      endothelium-dependent nitric oxide-mediated vasodilation and tissue-type plasminogen&#xD;
      activator release in anti-retroviral (ART)-treated HIV-1-seropositive adults. Furthermore,&#xD;
      the investigators hypothesize that the postulated diminishment in endothelial vasodilator and&#xD;
      fibrinolytic function with insufficient sleep will be due, at least in part, to increased&#xD;
      oxidative stress. Moreover, increasing sleep duration and improving sleep quality will&#xD;
      increase both endothelium-dependent nitric oxide-mediated vasodilation and endothelial&#xD;
      tissue-type plasminogen activator release in ART-treated HIV-1-seropositive adults. Increases&#xD;
      in endothelial vasodilator and fibrinolytic function will be due, at least in part, to&#xD;
      reduced oxidative stress.&#xD;

    <description>Phase 1 is a cross-sectional study to compare endothelial vasodilator and fibrinolytic function in ART-treated HIV-1-seropositive adults who habitually sleep more than 7 hours/night (normal sleep) and those who habitually sleep less than 7 hours/night (short sleep).</description>

    <description>Phase 2 is an intervention study to determine the effects of individualized targeted sleep interventions that increase sleep duration and improve sleep quality on endothelial vasodilator and fibrinolytic function in ART-treated HIV-1-seropositive adults who habitually sleep less than 7 hours/night.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Individualized Targeted Sleep</intervention_name>
    <description>The investigators will employ an 8-week individualized targeted sleep intervention. Individualized targeted interventions have the advantage of improving adherence, reducing attrition, and making the strategy personally meaningful.</description>
