    <textblock>
      The NeuroCatch Platform 2 (NCP2), an investigational medical device system developed by&#xD;
      NeuroCatch Inc., consists of software and hardware that captures brain health information.&#xD;
      The platform intends to provide a quick, portable and easy to use solution for the&#xD;
      acquisition, display, analysis, storage, reporting and management of electroencephalograph&#xD;
      (EEG) and event-related potential (ERP; brain response to a stimulus) information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NCP2 uses two types of tones to elicit N100 and P300 ERPs, along with two types of words&#xD;
      to elicit N400 ERPs. The objective of this study is to determine if changing the volume of&#xD;
      the standard tone has an effect on the amplitudes and latencies of the ERPs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Electroencephalography (EEG) signals have been collected and studied since the early 1970s as&#xD;
      a non-invasive way of assessing brain function. As early as the 1930s, a derivative of the&#xD;
      raw EEG signal - event-related potentials (ERPs) - were computed. These scalp-recorded ERPs&#xD;
      are the brain's response to a stimulus of interest (e.g. a flashing checkerboard or an angry&#xD;
      face). The size, timing, and topographical location of ERP components lend insight into the&#xD;
      timing and complexity of various cognitive processes. At NeuroCatch Inc. (NCI), research is&#xD;
      primarily focused on three ERP components: the N100, P300 and N400, associated with different&#xD;
      attention abilities (sensory processing, target detection &amp; semantic processing).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The N100 is a negative-going deflection around 100 ms post stimulus onset. This particular&#xD;
      ERP component indexes sensory stimulus at a pre-attentive level, or in other words, the&#xD;
      acknowledgement by the brain that information has entered the system. Whereas the P300 - a&#xD;
      positive-going deflection around 300 ms - indexes an early stage of attentional processing.&#xD;
      This component is particularly sensitive to context updating or target identification (the&#xD;
      brain's 'Ah-ha!' response). Finally, the N400 is a negative-going deflection peaking around&#xD;
      400 ms post stimulus. This component is measured in situations of semantic violations (e.g.&#xD;
      'The pizza was too hot to â€¦ lamp&quot;), thus indexing one of the highest-order cognitive&#xD;
      functions: language processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each of the three ERP components have been studied in academic laboratories for multiple&#xD;
      decades and prototypical values for their timing (latency) and size (amplitude) have become&#xD;
      widely accepted. To elicit the ERP components of interest in this study (N100, P300, N400),&#xD;
      proprietary auditory stimulus sequences will be administered using the NeuroCatch Platform 2,&#xD;
      an investigational medical device. Each sequence consists of tones and word pairs to elicit&#xD;
      the various components of interest. Standard tones (lower volume, low pitch) make up most of&#xD;
      the tones in the sequence, with deviant tones (higher volume, higher pitch) inserted in&#xD;
      random intervals. The difference in volume and pitch between the standard tones and deviant&#xD;
      tones, coupled with the &quot;unexpected&quot; nature of the deviant tone, is what drives the N100 and&#xD;
      P300 responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NeuroCatch Platform 2 consists of a computerized acquisition software which presents the&#xD;
      stimulus, acquires the data and presents the amplitude and latency values of the ERP&#xD;
      components (N100, N400, P300). This protocol is intended to assess the effect of changing the&#xD;
      standard tone volume in the NeuroCatch Platform 2 auditory tone sequences on the elicited ERP&#xD;
      responses.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a within-subject repeated-measures, randomly counterbalanced, single blind study.&#xD;
All participants will be asked to attend two study visits, one week (6-8 days) apart. At each study visit, participants will complete two NeuroCatch Platform 2 assessments with different auditory sequences. One sequence will include the Standard Tone A (80dB), and another will include Standard Tone B (93dB) while keeping the deviant tone volume consistent (105dB). The order of presentation of the two sequences will be randomly counterbalanced (i.e Session 1: AB &amp; Session 2: BA, or Session 1: BA &amp; Session 2: AB).</intervention_model_description>
