  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multi-center, open-label, prospective, randomized clinical trial of the aura6000(R) System&#xD;
      for the reduction of apnea and hypopneas in adult patients with moderate to severe&#xD;
      obstructive sleep apnea who have failed or are unwilling to use positive airway pressure&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All qualifying subjects will be implanted. Subjects will be randomized 2:1 in favor of&#xD;
      Stimulation therapy (Active Group). Randomization will occur following implant and prior to&#xD;
      the Month 1 visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Active group will start Stimulation therapy at Month 1. The Control group may continue&#xD;
      with their current sleep apnea treatment until Month 7, and will receive Stimulation therapy&#xD;
      beginning at Month 7 +1Day. (All subjects are excluded from use of PAP or surgical treatments&#xD;
      after enrollment through Month 13)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and efficacy will be evaluated at Month 7, and again at Month 13.&#xD;
