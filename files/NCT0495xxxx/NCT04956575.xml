        Key Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant is in good health, in the opinion of the Investigator, based on review of&#xD;
             medical history and physical examination performed at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has a body mass index (BMI) of 18 kilograms (kg)/square meter (m^2) to 35&#xD;
             kg/m^2 (inclusive) at the Screening Visit (Day 0).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For female participants of childbearing potential: negative pregnancy test, adequate&#xD;
             contraception or has abstained from all activities that could result in pregnancy for&#xD;

        Key Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has had significant exposure to someone with laboratory-confirmed severe&#xD;
             acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, COVID-19, or&#xD;
             influenza in the past 14 days prior to the Screening Visit (Day 0), as defined by the&#xD;
             United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as close contact with&#xD;
             someone who has COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has a positive SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction&#xD;
             (RT-PCR) or antigen test in the past 10 days prior to the Screening Visit (Day 0).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant is acutely ill or febrile (body temperature ≥ 38.0 degrees Celsius&#xD;
             [°C]/100.4 degrees Fahrenheit [°F]) 72 hours prior to or at the Screening Visit (Day&#xD;
             0) or Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has a pre-existing medical condition that is not stable, at the discretion&#xD;
             of the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;

             assessments or interpretation of results according to the Investigator's judgment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has received systemic immunosuppressants or immune-modifying drugs for &gt;14&#xD;
             days in total within 6 months prior to Screening Visit (for corticosteroids ≥10&#xD;
             milligrams [mg]/day of prednisone equivalent) or is anticipating the need for&#xD;
             immunosuppressive treatment at any time during participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has received or plans to receive any licensed vaccine ≤28 days prior to&#xD;
             the investigational product (IP) injection (Day 1) or plans to receive a licensed&#xD;
             vaccine within 28 days after the IP injection, with the exception of vaccines&#xD;
             authorized or approved for the prevention of COVID-19 (regardless of type of vaccine)&#xD;
             that become available to participants during the study. Efforts should be made to&#xD;
             space study vaccination and COVID-19 vaccination by at least 7 and preferably 14 days,&#xD;
             but COVID-19 vaccination should not be delayed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has received a seasonal influenza vaccine or any other investigational&#xD;
             influenza vaccine after 01 January 2021.&#xD;
