  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we use conditional generation adversarial network to enhance the resolution of&#xD;
      MSCT images and obtain micro-CT-like images. Based on this, we measure the bone structure&#xD;
      indexes of micro-CT-like images and analyzed the correlation between bone structure and&#xD;
      bio-mechanical indexes.&#xD;

      In this study, we expect to collect 10 sets of vertebrae (between T6 and L5) from 10&#xD;
      formalin-fixed human cadavers. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the local&#xD;
      Institutional Review Boards.The collected specimens subject to normalized Micro-CT and MSCT&#xD;
      image scanning, image reconstruction using standard algorithms, and bone structure&#xD;
      observation using bone algorithms to obtain high-quality, standardized axial images. We will&#xD;
      use a conditional generation adversarial network-based image mapping technique to train the&#xD;
      mapping model between MSCT images and Micro-CT images, find the correspondence between the&#xD;
      image information contained in each of MSCT and Micro-CT, and finally obtain high-resolution&#xD;
      micro-CT-like images. After obtaining the Micro-CT-like images of the samples, we will&#xD;
      segment and annotate the images (including different structures such as vertebral body, bone&#xD;
      cortex) and train the Teacher-Student &amp; U-Net++ deep learning architecture to achieve&#xD;
      accurate segmentation of vertebral body regions, and obtain cancellous bone regions of&#xD;
      interest. Based on this, we will analyze the bone structure characteristics of each spatial&#xD;
      region in the images, including the thickness, spacing, orientation and distribution pattern&#xD;
      of bone trabeculae and other indicators. Ultimately, we will cut a standardized cubic sample&#xD;
      from the vertebral cancellous bone , obtain the bio-mechanical performance index of this&#xD;
      cancellous bone sample by mechanical experiments, and analyze the correlation between bone&#xD;
      structure of Micro-CT-like images and bio-mechanical index.&#xD;
