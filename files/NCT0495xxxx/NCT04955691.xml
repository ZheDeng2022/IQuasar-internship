  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As more adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D) opt to follow very low carbohydrate diets to&#xD;
      improve glucose control, it is becoming increasingly important to study the metabolic and&#xD;
      neurological changes that occur on these diets and how these effect patient safety.&#xD;
      Understanding the impact of dietary changes on metabolic and neurological factors will help&#xD;
      guide clinical advice about the overall safety and efficacy of these diets in the pediatric&#xD;
      T1D population. This work will be the basis of future studies testing dietary interventions&#xD;
      to improve glycemic control and ensure that these dietary interventions are safe for growing&#xD;
      youth with T1D.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The primary objective of this randomized crossover study is to determine whether a very low&#xD;
      carbohydrate diet improves glycemic changes (measured by continuous glucose monitors) when&#xD;
      compared to a standard carbohydrate diet in youth with type 1 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are to compare metabolic changes after 2 weeks on each&#xD;
      diet using the 2-step hyperinsulinemic euglycemic-hypoglycemic clamp and stable isotope&#xD;
      infusions. The euglycemic portion of the clamp will allow us to determine the hepatic glucose&#xD;
      production and adipose tissue lipolysis. Secondary objectives also include measuring the&#xD;
      neurohormonal response to hypoglycemia after 2 weeks on each diet.&#xD;
