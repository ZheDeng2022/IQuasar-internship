      This is a formative research study to test a culturally-centered, program-level&#xD;
      implementation intervention to increase the use of medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD)&#xD;
      in four healthcare and addiction specialty treatment sites serving American Indian and Alaska&#xD;
      Native communities. The study design is a cluster randomized stepped wedge implementation&#xD;
      trial with two steps, and two sites per step (N=4 sites). Study design and methods are&#xD;
      informed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and the RE-AIM&#xD;
      framework (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance). The primary outcome&#xD;
      of the trial is the number of consumers with OUD initiated onto MOUD (i.e., buprenorphine,&#xD;
      extended-release naltrexone, or methadone) in the 6 months after intervention delivery&#xD;
      (compared to the 6 months before intervention delivery) - capturing implementation&#xD;
      intervention Reach. The primary outcome will be measured at the end of the six-month&#xD;
      implementation stage and compared to the pre-intervention observation phase (prior to&#xD;
      delivery of the implementation intervention). Primary data collection will use de-identified&#xD;
      data from the electronic medical records (EMR) at each site beginning with data from the six&#xD;
      months prior to intervention delivery for Step 1 sites and 12 months prior for Step 2 sites.&#xD;
      For Step 1 sites, some secondary outcomes will also be assessed during the sustainment stage&#xD;
      (the six months following implementation). As part of the study, consumers with OUD will be&#xD;
      asked to participate in additional assessments and provide informed consent. Enrolled&#xD;
      consumer participants will be asked to complete four assessment visits (baseline, week 4,&#xD;
      week 8, and week 12) to collect comprehensive information about mental health, cultural&#xD;
      connectedness and spirituality, social functioning, and experiences with and acceptability of&#xD;
      OUD treatment. Providers at each clinical site will also be asked to complete surveys at&#xD;
      three time points to assess attitudes, knowledge, and readiness related to MOUD.&#xD;
