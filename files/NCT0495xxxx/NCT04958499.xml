      Bio-healthy parks are an alternative for practicing physical activity outdoors and free of&#xD;
      charge. However, there is no research that analyzes the effect of a planned training program&#xD;
      in these parks. There are two types of parks under development, with and without externally&#xD;
      added resistance. Therefore, general objective of this project are to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      8 weeks of targeted training in bio-healthy parks on body composition, bone mineral density,&#xD;
      blood pressure, strength, functional capacity, sarcopenia, sagittal disposition of the spine,&#xD;
      quality of life, life satisfaction and Mediterranean diet adherence in adults and older&#xD;
      adults. The present project will be developed through a randomized controlled trial, with 1&#xD;
      experimental and 1 control group, with pre-test and post-test, with intra-group and&#xD;
      inter-group analysis for each of the dependent variables of the study. It will be measure&#xD;
      body composition, bone mineral density, blood pressure, upper limb strength, lower limb&#xD;
      strength, functional capacity, sarcopenia, sagittal disposition of the spine, Health-related&#xD;
      quality of life, satisfaction with life and Mediterranean diet adherence. Experimental group&#xD;
      will receive the exercise program on bio-healthy park machine with a frequency of 2 sessions&#xD;
      per week of 55 minutes for 8 weeks. The control group will not perform any intervention&#xD;
      program following their usual activity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aging process is associated with physiological, psychological and functional&#xD;
      deterioration. It has been demonstrated that the practice of physical activity can prevent,&#xD;
      slow or reduce this deterioration. Bio-healthy parks are an alternative for practicing&#xD;
      physical activity outdoors and free of charge. However, there is no research that analyzes&#xD;
      the effect of a planned training program in these parks. There are two types of parks under&#xD;
      development, with and without externally added resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the objectives of this project are to evaluate the effect of 8 weeks of targeted&#xD;
      training in bio-healthy parks, with a frequency of 2 sessions per week on body composition,&#xD;
      bone mineral density, blood pressure, strength, functional capacity, sarcopenia, sagittal&#xD;
      disposition of the spine, quality of life, life satisfaction and mediterranean diet&#xD;
      satisfaction in adults and older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present project will be developed through a randomized controlled trial, with 1&#xD;
      experimental and 1 control group, with pre-test and post-test, with intra-group and&#xD;
      inter-group analysis for each of the dependent variables of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria are: (a) not having participated in a structured exercise program for&#xD;
      at least 1 year, (b) being older than 50 years of age, and (c) being physically independent.&#xD;
      The exclusion criteria are: (a) having musculoskeletal injuries or limitations that could&#xD;
      affect the health and physical performance of the person; (b) being under medical&#xD;
      prescription for taking medications that could influence physical performance; (c) not&#xD;
      regularly attending the proposed sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body composition and bone mineral density will be assessed by dual energy X-ray&#xD;
      absorptiometry (DEXA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood pressure by means of an automatic device (Colin BP 880, Inc., Tampa, FL). Strength by&#xD;
      manual dynamometry (TKK 5401; Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and maximal isometric strength of knee&#xD;
      extension and biceps flexion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional capacity will be assessed by means of the Chari stand test, gait speed, time up&#xD;
      and go test and Short physical performance battery (SPPB), Sarcopenia will be assessed taking&#xD;
      into account the reference values established for muscle quality (hand grip strength and&#xD;
      chair stand test), muscle quantity (DEXA fat-free mass) and functional competence (gait&#xD;
      speed, time up and go test, SPPB and 400 meter walk) established by the European Consensus&#xD;
      (EWGSOP2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Spinal Mouse device (Switzerland) will be used to assess the sagittal disposition of the&#xD;
      spine (thoracic curve, lumbar curve and pelvic tilt) in standing and relaxed sitting. This&#xD;
      technique is non-invasive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health-related quality of life and satisfaction with life will be assessed by means of the&#xD;
      SF36 and The Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWL) questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mediterranean diet adherence will be assess with a Mediterranean diet adherence questionaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental group 1 will receive the exercise program on bio-healthy machinery with a&#xD;
      frequency of 2 sessions per week of 55 minutes for 8 weeks. The machines used will be rider,&#xD;
      low gemini, high gemini, walk, bottoms, flywheels circles, flywheels rotation, twin swing,&#xD;
      surf, swing press and rowing. Intensity will be controlled by subjective perception of effort&#xD;
      and heart rate (Polar 420). There will be a warm-up 8-10 minutes, a main part 40-45 minutes&#xD;
      and a return to calm 5-10 minutes. The intervention programs will be developed by a graduate&#xD;
      in Physical Activity and Sport Sciences. The load will be progressed every 2 weeks. The&#xD;
      control group will not perform any intervention program following their usual activity.&#xD;
