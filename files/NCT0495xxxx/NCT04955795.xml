  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to examine the efficacy of a brief intervention plus a&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral intervention compared to brief intervention alone to address unhealthy&#xD;
      alcohol use and comorbid mental health symptoms to improve HIV outcomes among people living&#xD;
      with HIV in Alabama.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either Alcohol Brief Intervention (BI) or&#xD;
      BI plus Common Elements Treatment Approach (T-CETA) via telephone. Participants will receive&#xD;
      either 1 phone session of BI or 6 to 12 weekly phone sessions of BI + T-CETA. Follow ups will&#xD;
      occur at 6 and 12 months with participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will provide data on alcohol use, mental health comorbidities, HIV outcomes,&#xD;
      medication adherence, and laboratory collections (CD4+ T cell count, viral load, and an&#xD;
      alcohol biomarker: PEth) at the baseline assessment and again at the 6 and 12 month follow&#xD;
      ups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also conduct mixed methods implementation measures with a subset of&#xD;
      participants who are selected across various strata (i.e. gender, age, trial arm).&#xD;

    <measure>Change from Baseline Alcohol Use at 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Defined by the participant's score on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT). The minimum score on the AUDIT measure is 0, and the maximum score on the AUDIT measure is 40. For women, a score of of 4 or greater indicates hazardous or harmful alcohol consumption. For men, a score of 8 or greater indicates hazardous or harmful alcohol consumption. Higher scores on the AUDIT measure indicates more hazardous or harmful alcohol consumption.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline Alcohol Use at 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Defined by the participant's blood level of phosphatidylethanol (PEth). Participants will undergo a finger prick to collect a blood sample which will be analyzed for PEth level. PEth level of less than 20 ng/mL indicates abstinence or light drinking (from not drinking to averaging less than two drinks/day for several days a week). PEth level of 20-200 ng/mL indicates moderate level of drinking (averaging between 2 to 4 drinks/day for several days a week). Higher levels of PEth in the blood indicate more hazardous or harmful alcohol consumption.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline Substance Use at 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Defined by the Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST). The minimum score on each substance (i.e. tobacco, alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, amphetamines, inhalants, sedatives, hallucinogens, opioids, or other substances) is 0 to 3 (Low health risk). Moderate health risk is defined as a score of 4-26. High heath risk is defined as a score of 27 and higher. Higher scores indicate greater risk for health issues as a result of substance use.</description>

    <description>The BI we will use was based on CETA's substance use module and was designed for one-on-one delivery. It is comprised of 6 elements (i.e. assessment, understanding impacts, exploring change, goal setting, identifying the reasons, and skill building) including a 2-week alcohol timeline follow back assessment, which is completed by the therapist. BI will be provided by a trained research assistant who has completed consent, enrollment, and randomized procedures with the client.</description>

    <intervention_name>Common Elements Treatment Approach (CETA) via Telemedicine</intervention_name>
    <description>CETA consists of nine key elements (i.e. engagement and education; safety assessment and planning; psychoeducation/introduction; substance use reduction; behavioral activation; cognitive coping/restructuring; relaxation; exposure; and problem solving) that address common mental health problems such as trauma, PTSD, depression, and anxiety. Participants randomized to CETA will be assigned to a CETA provider (clinical psychology or social work graduate student or master's degree substance abuse counselor). Enrolled participants will be discussed at weekly supervision meetings. An individualized treatment plan will be designed for each participant including type and order of CETA modules. The counselor will contact the participant by phone to schedule CETA sessions and follow up any missed appointments. Counselors, who will also be given a unique ID# for documentation and analysis, will carry 3-10 active CETA cases at a time depending on their experience level.</description>
