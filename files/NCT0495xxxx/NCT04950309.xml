      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brain activity produces magnetic fields. These fields can be measured outside the head.&#xD;
      Existing technology, called MEG, measures these fields. Researchers are testing a new type of&#xD;
      magnetic field sensor called OPM. They hope it can help pinpoint with very high accuracy&#xD;
      where brain activity is generated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To develop and test a new type of sensor for measuring the magnetic fields produced by brain&#xD;
      activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy people ages 18-65 who had a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan under protocol&#xD;
      17-M-0181.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may be asked to complete sessions on both the traditional MEG instrument and the&#xD;
      OPM array.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the MEG, 3 small coils will be placed on the participant s face with tape. Their head&#xD;
      will be positioned inside the MEG device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the OPM, sensors are housed in a 3d printed array. The sensors will be attached to a cap&#xD;
      placed on the participant s head.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both scans, participants will be seated in a chair inside a magnetically shielded room.&#xD;
      They may complete several tasks. In one task, plastic cells will be placed on their fingers.&#xD;
      Puffs of air will be sent to these cells, which will stimulate the sense of touch. Other&#xD;
      tasks may include the following stimuli: visual (such as checkerboards), auditory (such as&#xD;
      beeps and tones), or language (words and letters).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers may also obtain recordings while they stimulate the nerve in the participant s&#xD;
      forearm using electrical current in small electrodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation is expected to last for 1 day. Additional optional scans may be offered for up&#xD;
      to 1 year....&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Currently available functional neuroimaging techniques can meet many, but not all needs of&#xD;
      clinical neuroscientists. While functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is able to map&#xD;
      brain function to millimeter resolution, it has poor temporal resolution. In contrast,&#xD;
      magnetoencephalography (MEG) directly measures magnetic fields generated by populations of&#xD;
      neurons. The factors limiting the spatial resolution of MEG include the finite number of&#xD;
      sensors compared to brain sources, and the available signal to noise ratio (SNR). Whole head&#xD;
      SQUID based MEG systems have been employed to study a wide array of brain processes and&#xD;
      pathologies, including aging, neurodegeneration, memory, semantic processing, and network&#xD;
      organization. The signals measured using MEG consist primarily of summed postsynaptic&#xD;
      potentials generated by populations of pyramidal cells firing in synchrony. The signals&#xD;
      measured by MEG may represent either a field time-locked to a stimulus, or populations of&#xD;
      neurons oscillating in synchrony. Important gains in neuroscience have been made with MEG,&#xD;
      despite the current limitations of the technology. Development of a non-invasive MEG&#xD;
      technology capable of resolution approaching that ECoG could open entirely new domains of&#xD;
      noninvasive human neuroscience. This protocol is a technical development protocol to&#xD;
      characterize an optically pumped magnetometer (OPM) array used for measuring magnetic brain&#xD;
      signals. Our OPM array can be placed directly on the surface of the scalp, dramatically&#xD;
      improving SNR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Final OPM array will have 49-61 primary sensors, although we may assemble an interim&#xD;
      array with fewer sensors. We will fully characterize the performance of the array all stages,&#xD;
      and we will also validate the array using somatotopic mapping of the receptive fields of each&#xD;
      finger, and potentially each phalanx of each finger. This protocol will recruit up to 75&#xD;
      healthy male and female participants aged 18-65, from the greater Washington DC metropolitan&#xD;
      area. Participants will receive MEG recordings on a traditional MEG system and/or our&#xD;
      experimental OPM system.&#xD;
