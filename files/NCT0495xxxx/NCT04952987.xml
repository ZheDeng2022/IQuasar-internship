      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Diquafosol 3% in the management of&#xD;
      dry eyes before and after cataract surgery. Patients with pre-existing dry eyes and planned&#xD;
      for cataract surgery will be started on Diquafosol eyedrops prior to surgery and treatment&#xD;
      will be continued after cataract surgery. Eligible patients will undergo evaluation of dry&#xD;
      eye at baseline and subsequently started on treatment with Diquafosol for the duration of 4&#xD;
      weeks before surgery. Further evaluations will be conducted on the day of surgery and at&#xD;
      designated time points during and up to 12 weeks after surgery.&#xD;

      Title: Dry Eye Management with 3% Diquafosol Before and After Cataract Surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: LEC Eye Centre, Ipoh, Malaysia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Dry eye disease and cataract are two conditions which have been known to increase&#xD;
      in incidence with age. Dry eye disease can also be further exacerbated by cataract surgery.&#xD;
      Diquafosol (Diquas) is a P2Y2 receptor agonist which improves mucin and tear secretion and is&#xD;
      a 'first in class' therapeutic option which has been shown repeatedly to be efficacious in&#xD;
      dry eye management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of Diquafosol for dry eye management in patients with&#xD;
      pre-existing dry eye disease before and after cataract surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Observational case series in a private ophthalmic health facility&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Plan: Eligible patients will have treatment with Diquas for 4 weeks prior to undergoing&#xD;
      cataract surgery. Preoperative clinical evaluation will include documentation of severity of&#xD;
      signs and symptoms of dry eye and this will be carried out at baseline, immediately before&#xD;
      surgery and subsequently at Week 4 and Week 12.&#xD;
