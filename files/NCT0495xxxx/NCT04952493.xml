    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of anlotinib in combination&#xD;
      with I-131 in locally advanced/metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer. Anlotinib may stop&#xD;
      the growth of tumor cells and improve iodine uptake.&#xD;

      Primary Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      objective response rate (ORR) Secondary Outcome Measures：&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Biochemical Response Rate (BRR) Biochemical response rate is defined as the percentage&#xD;
           of subjects whose Tg was consecutive decreases more than 25% compared to baseline twice&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Progression-free Survival (PFS) (median) was determined using the number of months&#xD;
           measured from the initial date of treatment to the date of documented progression, or&#xD;
           the date of death (in the absence of progression) of participants. Progression is&#xD;
           defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as a&#xD;
           20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable&#xD;
           increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Nuclear medicine functional imaging changes of target lesions The dynamic changes of I&#xD;
           uptake and 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging&#xD;
