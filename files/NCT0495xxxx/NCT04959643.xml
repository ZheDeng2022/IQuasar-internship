  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A high number of people are infected by viral hepatitises B and C without knowing it,&#xD;
      especially vulnerable population such as the ones who come in consultation in continuous&#xD;
      health care access center (Permanence d'accès aux soins, PASS). Now that these infections can&#xD;
      be rapidly treated, it is essential to diagnose them the quickest possible. The&#xD;
      Identification and Diagnostic Orientation Test (Test de repérage et d'orientation&#xD;
      diagnostique, TROD) technique is a rapid tool allowing to screen for hepatitis B and C by a&#xD;
      simple capillary sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to evaluate the accptability of a systematic screening using TROD for&#xD;
      hepatitis B and C in adults in a PASS consultation in Montpellier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We also want to estimate the prevalence of theses infections in the population, to describe&#xD;
      the HBV and HCV care cascades, to evaluate the acceptability of vaccinal catch-up for HBV,&#xD;
      and to describe people with hepatits.&#xD;

      Context :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even if the rate of under-screening for viral hepatitis B and C is getting better, the&#xD;
      situation is still concerning. In France, it has been estimated that about 100 000 people&#xD;
      have a positive serology for hepatitis C, and that 75,000 are unaware of it. People in&#xD;
      vulnerable situations such as migrants or people in very precarious situations have an&#xD;
      increased risk of having been infected by one of these two viral hepatitises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Précavir study established the effecacy of systematic screening for viral hepatitis&#xD;
      during a consultation at a continuous health care access center (Permanence d'accès aux&#xD;
      soins, PASS). Screening in the same location as the consultation is recommended, as well as&#xD;
      the creation of a clear care pathway (Roudot-Thoraval et al. BEH 14-15 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to another study conducted in the Ile de France region, in consultations dedicated&#xD;
      to migrants, the prevalences of hepatitis B and C were 6.8% and 1.8% respectively; whereas&#xD;
      the vast majority of infected persons were unaware of their positivity (Revault et al. BEH&#xD;
      14-15; 2017). These vulnerable populations are a priority for individuals and for public&#xD;
      health in terms of viral hepatitis screening, care and prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systematic screening for hepatitis C is justified by the now universal access to treatment&#xD;
      and by the remarkable efficacy (&gt;95%) of new treatments against the hepatitis C virus. These&#xD;
      pan-genotypic treatments are prescribed for a short amount of time and have very few adverse&#xD;
      effects. Systematic screening as well as the implementation of treatment against hepatitis C&#xD;
      are essential in a view to obtain the elimination of hepatitis C in 2030 for the WHO and in&#xD;
      2025 for France. To this date, without screening and systematic initiation of treatment, the&#xD;
      various models are unanimous that this objective cannot be achieved. We must therefore take&#xD;
      advantage of all medical opportunities to offer this simple and cost-effective screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A double challenge resides for the hepatitis B: to offer treatment to people with chronic&#xD;
      viral hepatitis B and to make a systematic catch-up vaccination, which also makes it possible&#xD;
      to curb the risk of new transverse contaminations within communities or families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the recruitment will take place at the Montpellier PASS, the study population is said to&#xD;
      be vulnerable, in great precariousness, and not necesseraly up to date with social coverage&#xD;
      or administrative documents. Recruiting this population is essential because it is the target&#xD;
      of our study, and will help them get in touch with the healthcare system. Moreover, access to&#xD;
      screening first and then to care is a determining public health issue to improve the health&#xD;
      of this population and to reach the objectives of eliminating and limiting the circulation of&#xD;
      these viruses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of the rapid identification and diagnostic orientation test (Test de repérage et&#xD;
      d'orientation diagnostique, TROD) technique is interesting in this context because it can be&#xD;
      deployed outside of a classic screening structure, using a simple capillary sample. This type&#xD;
      of screening has proven its effectiveness in the diagnosis of infectious diseases in&#xD;
      populations with difficult access, and especially in the management of HIV and hepatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, our acceptability study in the Montpellier PASS follows the recommendations of&#xD;
      the health authorities as closely as possible. Indeed, the French National Authority for&#xD;
      Health (Haute Autorité de Santé, HAS) has issued recommendations for the use of HCV and HBV&#xD;
      screening using TROD in certain health care structures and in particular PASS (Place des&#xD;
      tests rapides d'orientation diagnostique (TROD) dans la stratégie de dépistage de l'hépatite&#xD;
      C, RECOMMANDATION EN SANTÉ PUBLIQUE, 27 mai 2014; Place des tests rapides d'orientation&#xD;
      diagnostique (TROD) dans la stratégie de dépistage de l'hépatite B, RECOMMANDATION EN SANTÉ&#xD;
      PUBLIQUE, 06 juillet 2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The main objective is to evaluate the acceptability of the systematic hepatitis B and C&#xD;
           screening using the TROD in adults in PASS consultations in Montpellier.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The secondary objectives are to :&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Determinate the seroprevalence of hepatitises B and C in our population&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Describe the care cascade of hepatitises B and C using the test and treat model&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Evaluate the rate of undetectable viral hepatitis C 12 weeks after the ending of&#xD;
                the hepatitis C antiviral treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Evaluate the acceptability of the catch-up vaccination in people with a negative&#xD;
                hepatitis B serology&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Describe the populations with hepatitises&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective study evaluating the acceptability of a systematic screening procedure will&#xD;
      include all adults coming to a PASS in Montpellier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will offer them a rapid screening of hepatitises B and C using the TROD. This is&#xD;
      recommended by the national authorities and actually offered at PASS in Montpellier but not&#xD;
      in the same location, which creates a large drag to systematic screening. Participants would&#xD;
      have the screening in situ, and the results immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will evaluate the rate of performed TROD out of the number of people to whom the TROD have&#xD;
      been offered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruiting 600 participants will allow us to estimate a screening acceptabity of 80% with a&#xD;
      +/- 3.2% precision. This will allow us to estimate an expected VHC prevalence of 5% with a&#xD;
      +/-2.5% precision. If 30 participants have a chronic hepatitis, we will estimate an expected&#xD;
      rate of 80% efficacively treated patients at 3 months with an 95% confidence interval of 66%&#xD;
      to 90%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the analyses, we will first describe the sociodemographic caracteristics of the&#xD;
      participants. Chronic HBV and HCV infections will be described with their 95% condidence&#xD;
      interval. The number of people in the care cascades will be calculated. Finally, the rate of&#xD;
      therapeutic success 12 weeks after the ending of the antiviral hepatitis C treatment will be&#xD;
      calculated and factors associated to therapeutic success for HBV or HCV will be analysed in&#xD;
      univariate or multivariate models if the number of treatment failures allows it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Program :&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the inclusion visit, an explaination of benefits of hepatitis screening and the study will&#xD;
      be offered. The non-objection to partipation will be noted. A simple questionnaire will be&#xD;
      completed by the nurse, with information already collected for usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the TROD is positive : immediate consultation with a hepatologist or a general&#xD;
      practitioner from the addictology service, clinical examination, somatic complication of&#xD;
      addiction, confirmation of HBV or HCV by blood sample, eventual pre-therapeutic assessment&#xD;
      for chronic hepatitis B and or C. Participants will be invited to come back 7 days later. A&#xD;
      social assistant will work to open the participant's rights to an healthcare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the TROD are negative : offering a hepatitis B cath-up vaccination, end of participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For non-included patients : age, sex and reason of non participation will be collected if the&#xD;
      patient don't object.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - First follow up visit (D7 +/-3 days) If positive viral HBV ADN : medical examination,&#xD;
      results announcement, prescription for an antiviral treatment, counselling, evaluation of&#xD;
      risk practices, next consultation proposed in 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If active chonic hepatitis C : medical examination, prescription for an antiviral&#xD;
      pangenotypic treatment, counselling, evaluation of risk practices, next consultation proposed&#xD;
      in 2 or 3 months depending of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Second follow up visit (HBV : W12 +/- 10 days; HCV : W8 +/- 3 days or W12 +/- 10 days) If&#xD;
      treated B hepatitis (W12) : medical examination, evaluation of medication adherence, drug&#xD;
      tolerance, blood sample, new prescription if needed, counselling, risk practices evalueation,&#xD;
      participation in the will be over but the patient will have a regular medical follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If treated C hepatitis (2 or 3 months) : medical examination, medical adherence evaluation,&#xD;
      drug tolerance evaluation, risk practices evaluation, counselling, next follow-up visit given&#xD;
      : 12 weeks after the treatment ending.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Third follow up visit Hepatitis C : 12 weeks after the treatment ending : medical&#xD;
      examination, drug tolerance evaluation, blood sample, risk practices evaluation, counselling,&#xD;
      healing announcement 7 days later by phone or new consultation depending of the participant's&#xD;
      will. End of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasability:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PASS have a translation software use routinely to communicate with non French speaking&#xD;
      population. A simple and clear information notice has been created to ease the comprehension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pratical formation to use the TROD will be given to the PASS nurse before the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of patients seen at the PASS in 2019 was 1,110 meaning 20 consultation per workday&#xD;
      : we can guess that we will be able to include 40 patients a week and 600 patients a year.&#xD;
