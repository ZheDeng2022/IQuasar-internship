    <textblock>
      In this study we aimed to assess the clinical and laboratory profile of some Egyptian&#xD;
      asthmatic children who are sensitized to house dust mites and determine the association of&#xD;
      HDM sensitization and severity of asthma according to recent GINA guidelines.&#xD;

      This is an observational, case control study. The study was carried out in Allergy, Clinical&#xD;
      Immunology and pediatric pulmonology Unit; at Mansoura University Children Unit during the&#xD;
      years 2018-2019. The study included 60 children above 6 years with atopic asthma. They were&#xD;
      42 males and 18 females, their age ranged from 8-17 years. Bronchial asthma diagnosis was&#xD;
      based on clinical manifestations and spirometry results. Atopy was defined as presence of&#xD;
      symptoms of atopic dermatitis, allergic rhino conjunctivitis, or food allergy, it was&#xD;
      confirmed when asthmatic children fulfilled one of the following criteria: higher serum level&#xD;
      of total IgE (more than 32IU/ml), eosinophilia (differential count more than 5% or absolute&#xD;
      count more than 450/µl) or positive skin prick test (3 mm greater than control).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asthmatic children were maintained on controller therapy for at least 6 months. They were&#xD;
      classified according to skin prick test results into two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group1: It included 30 atopic asthmatic children, who were sensitive to one of the two&#xD;
           HDM (D pteronyssinus or D farina).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group2: It included 30 atopic asthmatic children who were not sensitive to HDM allergy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sampling Samples were convenient and patients were enrolled in the study by consecutive&#xD;
           manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      history taking&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Personal and demographic data e.g. age, sex and residence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Asthma symptoms; cough, wheeze, as well as exercise-induced asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Symptoms of other atopic diseases in the child including allergic march.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Based on frequency of each symptom, assessment of asthma control was done according to&#xD;
           GINA 2017.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary Function Test (Spirometry) Forced expiratory volume in 1 second FEV1%; forced vital&#xD;
      capacity (FVC %); FEV1/FVC ratio and forced expiratory flow rate from 25% to 75% of vital&#xD;
      capacity (FEF25-75%) were measured by spirometry (Master Screen pediatrics). The highest&#xD;
      reading of three successive measurements was taken. Reference values were computed according&#xD;
      to the recommendations of the American Thoracic Society standards of acceptability and&#xD;
      reproducibility in subjects above the age of 6 years who need cooperation for forced&#xD;
      respiratory maneuver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin prick test: for (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and Dermatophagoides Farina). Through&#xD;
      the use of specific allergen extracts, positive and negative controls, then interpretation&#xD;
      after 15-20 minutes of maneuver, a wheal ≥3 mm diameter is considered positive. Before the&#xD;
      test, we checked that the patient has not taken medications that might interfere with the&#xD;
      test and antihistamines had stopped using before the skin prick test (2 days for the first&#xD;
      generation and 7 days for the second generation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3- Eosinophil count Blood sample was collected in EDTA tube. Total leucocytic count and&#xD;
      eosinophilia % were determined by automated cell counter [11].&#xD;
&#xD;
      4- Serum IgE Blood samples were collected into tubes with ethylene tetr-acetic acid (EDTA).&#xD;
      After incubation at room temperature for 20 minutes, tubes were centrifuged for 15 minute at&#xD;
      2500 revolutions per minute (rpm). Supernatant levels of IgE were determined by the ELISA&#xD;
      technique [12].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment level of asthma severity Classification of asthma according to disease severity is&#xD;
      defined level (mild, moderate, severe) according to treatment steps when the patient has been&#xD;
      maintained on regular controller therapy for several months. Patient maintained on step 2&#xD;
      treatments are often classified as having mild asthma. Those receive step 3-4 as moderate&#xD;
      asthma and those prescribed step 4-5 as having moderate to severe asthma [2].&#xD;
&#xD;
      I) Assessment level of asthma control based on asthma control score according to GINA&#xD;
      guideline defined as controlled, partially controlled and well controlled .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data were fed to the computer and analyzed using IBM SPSS Corp. Released 2013. IBM SPSS&#xD;
      Statistics for Windows, Version 22.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp. The following tests were used:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative data: Chi-Square test for comparison of 2 or more groups. Monte Carlo test as&#xD;
      correction for Chi-Square test when more than 25% of cells have count less than 5 in tables&#xD;
      (&gt;2*2).&#xD;
