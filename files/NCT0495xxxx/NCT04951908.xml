  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      the study aimed to evaluate the clinical and MRI finding of TMJ AND LPM with predication of&#xD;
      the risk factors. Study design: this retrospective study included 1365 joints in 800 patients&#xD;
      diagnosed as TMJ internal derangement and all the patients examined by MRI from 2008 to 2019.&#xD;
      Cases with loss of continuity of articular disk or the posterior attachment of the disk were&#xD;
      considered as positive cases.&#xD;

        The retrospective study included patients seeking treatment for TMD at Al-Azhar University&#xD;
        Hospital and the outpatient clinic at the Faculty of Dental Medicine of Al-Azahr&#xD;
        University. The sample originally included patients who provided consent to participate in&#xD;
        this study and who ultimately underwent treatment for TMJD between 2008 and 2019.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Exclusion Inclusion criteria: Patients were included if they were older than 18 years&#xD;
             and diagnosed with TMJD. criteria for this study included systemic diseases (the&#xD;
             presence of polyarthritis or other rheumatic diseases), contraindications for MRI&#xD;
             (e.g., implanted metal or medical devices, claustrophobia), the presence of neurologic&#xD;
