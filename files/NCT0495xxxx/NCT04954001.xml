  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      FCN-159 is a highly active MEK1/2 inhibitor that was designed, synthesized and screened on&#xD;
      the basis of the structure of trametinib. FCN-159 is an orally available and highly potent&#xD;
      selective inhibitor of MEK1/2, which is expected to be a targeted therapy for the treatment&#xD;
      of advanced solid tumors and neurofibromatosis type 1.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        General inclusion criteria for Phase I and II:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1.Cohort 1: 16-70 years of age (inclusive) with a body weight of ≥ 94 lbs or 42.5 kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Cohort 2: 2-15 years of age (inclusive) and able to swallow whole tablet. 2.Participants&#xD;
        must be diagnosed with NF1-related plexiform neurofibromas (PN) and symptomatic with&#xD;
        requirement of systematic therapy per investigator's judgment. A PN is defined as a&#xD;
        neurofibroma that has grown along the length of a nerve and may involve multiple fascicles&#xD;
        and branches. A spinal PN involves two or more levels with connection between the levels or&#xD;
        extending laterally along the nerve. Diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is based&#xD;
        on meeting at least 1 of the following 2 diagnostic criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Genetic testing confirmation: i.e., positive for NF1 germline mutation per&#xD;
             CLIA-certified laboratory (or equivalent) testing. Note: NF1 germline mutation&#xD;
             positive must either be confirmed by the FCN-159-002 central laboratory or have&#xD;
             documentation of NF1 mutation issued by a CLIA-certified laboratory (or equivalent) -&#xD;
             OR -&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Clinical and imaging confirmation: Meets at least 2 of the following 7 NF1 diagnostic&#xD;
             criteria according to the clinical NIH consensus criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. ≥ 6 cafe-au-lait macules (&gt;0.5 cm in prepubertal participants and &gt; 1.5 cm in&#xD;
                  post-pubertal participants);&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Axillary freckling or freckling in inguinal regions;&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. ≥2 neurofibromas of any type, or ≥ 1 plexiform neurofibroma;&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. An optic pathway glioma;&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. ≥2 Lisch nodules (iris hamartomas);&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. A distinctive bony lesion such as dysplasia of the sphenoid bone or dysplasia or&#xD;
                  thinning of long bone cortex);&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. First-degree relative with NF1. 3. Participants should meet one of the following&#xD;
                  criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Must be judged by the investigator to be inoperable for complete resection&#xD;
                  without causing substantial damage, or unsuitable for surgery with high surgical&#xD;
                  risks or patient refuses surgery, e.g. due to encasement of or close proximity to&#xD;
                  vital structures, invasiveness, or high vascularity. NF1 has to cause or has the&#xD;
                  potential to cause significant morbidity, such as (but not limited to) head and&#xD;
                  neck lesions that could compromise the airway or great vessels, paraspinal&#xD;
                  lesions that can cause myelopathy, brachial or lumbar plexus lesions that could&#xD;
                  cause nerve compression and loss of function, lesions that could result in major&#xD;
                  deformity (e.g., orbital lesions) or are significantly disfiguring, lesions of&#xD;
                  the extremity that cause limb hypertrophy or loss of function, and painful&#xD;
                  lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. The participants who have previously received surgical treatment, if the PN&#xD;
                  resection is incomplete, the postoperative residual exceeds 15% of the primary&#xD;
                  lesion, or relapse after surgery, and the lesions of at least 3 cm are measured&#xD;
                  in one dimension, are eligible for enrollment. At least a 28-day interval is&#xD;
                  required between surgery and the first dose of FCN-159.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  4. Participants must have a measurable lesion, defined as at least 3 cm in length&#xD;
                  in at least one dimension, amenable to MRI for efficacy assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  5. Adult participants: Karnofsky performance level of ≥70%; Pediatric&#xD;
                  participants: Lansky performance score ≥ 70%, see Appendix 18.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  Note: Participants who are wheelchair bound because of paralysis secondary to a&#xD;
                  plexiform neurofibroma should be considered ambulatory when they are in the&#xD;
                  wheelchair. Similarly, participants with limited mobility secondary to the need&#xD;
                  for mechanical support (such as an airway PN requiring tracheostomy or CPAP) will&#xD;
                  also be considered ambulatory for the purposes of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  6. Coagulation function: International normalized ratio (INR) and activated&#xD;
                  partial thromboplastin time (APTT) ≤ 1.5 ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  7. Participants or their legal guardians (if the participant is &lt;18 years old)&#xD;
                  are able to understand and voluntarily sign a written informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  8. For participants of childbearing potential: participants must agree to take&#xD;
                  effective contraception, and receive double barrier contraception, condom, oral&#xD;
                  or injectable contraceptives, intrauterine device and other contraceptive methods&#xD;
                  during treatment and for at least 90 days after the last dose. Male participants&#xD;
                  must agree to avoid sperm donation for at least 90 days after the last dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  9. Willing to avoid excessive sun exposure and use adequate amounts of sunscreen&#xD;
                  if sun exposure is anticipated.&#xD;
