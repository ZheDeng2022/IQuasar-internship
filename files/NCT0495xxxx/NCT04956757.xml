    <textblock>
      Scapula retraction exercises are often recommended as a part of the exercise programs. The&#xD;
      primary aim of this study is to investigate the initial effect of the scapula retraction&#xD;
      exercises on acromiohumeral distance (AHD) at varying shoulder abduction angles and to&#xD;
      compare asymptomatic subjects. The secondary aim of this study is to investigate the effect&#xD;
      of scapula retraction exercises on pain, function and AHD in patients with SPS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subacmial pain syndrome (SPS) is a common cause of shoulder pain and dysfunction in the&#xD;
      general population. Exercise interventions is thought as a primary choice in clinical&#xD;
      settings. Scapula retraction exercises are commonly recommended as a part of the exercise&#xD;
      programs. Applying scapula retraction exercises at varying shoulder abduction angles could&#xD;
      restore balance between the scapulothoracic muscles. Since the scapulothoracic muscles&#xD;
      dynamically control subacromial space, scapula retraction exercises could further help to&#xD;
      maintain AHD during arm elevation.&#xD;

      of scapula retraction exercises on pain, function and AHD in patients with SPS.&#xD;

    <description>Acromiohumeral Distance will be recorded at 0°, 30°, 45°, 60° and 90° of shoulder abduction, and while they are doing scapular retraction with resistive elastic band at each shoulder position. All assessment will be recorded at baseline and at the end of the twelve week rehabilitation sessions</description>

    <measure>disability status</measure>
    <time_frame>SPADI Score will be recorded at baseline and 12-week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>disability status will be assessed by using Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADİ). All assessment will be recorded at baseline and at the end of the twelve week treatment sessions.&#xD;
The questionnaire is scored on a 100-point scale, where 0 represents &quot;no disabilities&quot; and 100 represents &quot;extreme disabilities&quot;</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>pain severity</measure>
    <time_frame>pain severity will be recorded at baseline and 12-week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>pain severity will be assessed by using 100 millimeters Visual Analogue Scale at rest, at night and during activity.&#xD;
All patients were asked to mark their pain level that corresponds to their pain intensity on the line between &quot;0=no pain&quot; and &quot;100=the worst pain imaginable&quot;.</description>
