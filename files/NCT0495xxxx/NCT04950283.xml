  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For a long time, no direct connection was seen between the two common diseases diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus and osteoporosis. However, as more and more younger people are affected by obesity,&#xD;
      develop type 2 diabetes mellitus and suffer osteoporotic fractures, the question of a&#xD;
      connection between these clinical pictures has now arisen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modern magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy techniques allow detailed and non-invasive&#xD;
      characterization of bone marrow in different body regions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low body weight (BMI&lt;20kg/m²) has been shown to be associated with decreased bone density,&#xD;
      while obesity has long been associated with high cortical bone mass - the idea of bone&#xD;
      health. It has now been proven that obesity also has a negative effect on bone structure.&#xD;
      Here, it is not only BMI that is crucial, but also the localization of fat tissue in the&#xD;
      body. Visceral fat has a directly damaging effect on bone microarchitecture through&#xD;
      dysregulated production and release of cytokines and adipokines. Thus, it has been shown that&#xD;
      both type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients have a decreased rate of bone remodeling and very&#xD;
      obese patients with type 2 diabetes have an increased risk of fracture. It must be concluded&#xD;
      that body weight, or BMI, cannot be the sole measure for estimating bone health. Thus, type 2&#xD;
      diabetes shows reduced bone remodeling with normal or slightly increased bone density, but&#xD;
      inferior stability. This means that type 2 diabetes is associated with an increased risk of&#xD;
      osteoporotic fracture, even when bone density measurements are unremarkable. Loss of&#xD;
      trabecular bone structure in red (hematopoietic) bone marrow is also characterized by&#xD;
      increasing infiltration of the bone marrow space with fat cells (bone marrow adipose tissue).&#xD;
      In contrast, the yellow bone marrow, which is mainly present in the diaphysis of tabular&#xD;
      bones, has particularly large amounts of fat incorporated into the reticulum cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For a long time, only the role of &quot;placeholder&quot; was attributed to these fat cells, but it has&#xD;
      been shown that they interact with other cells via the production of autocrine, paracrine and&#xD;
      endocrine hormones and cytokines, or adipokines, and are thus related to the metabolic state&#xD;
      of the entire body. A basic assumption here is that the amount of unsaturated fatty acids in&#xD;
      the adipose bone marrow is an important and functional marker for different types of&#xD;
      adipocytes. It has been shown that 3 individuals with poorer insulin sensitivity have more&#xD;
      unsaturated fatty acids in yellow bone marrow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the concept of different types of adipocytes in the bone marrow, with their inherent&#xD;
      different fatty acid composition could serve to reconcile the at first glance&#xD;
      counterintuitive physiological regulation of bone marrow fat and its response to metabolic&#xD;
      perturbations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to show whether and how the composition of the yellow (unsaturated fatty acids) and&#xD;
      red (bone marrow adipose tissue) bone marrow differs in healthy individuals, individuals with&#xD;
      impaired insulin sensitivity in different age groups and patients with type 2 diabetes, and&#xD;
      whether this can be used to detect early changes in the bone matrix with regard to bone&#xD;
      density, the proportion of bone marrow adipose tissue in the red bone marrow at different&#xD;
      locations in the skeleton will be quantified by means of chemical-shift-selective MRI&#xD;
      sequences as well as the composition of bone marrow fat in the yellow bone marrow with regard&#xD;
      to the proportions of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids by means of&#xD;
      volume-selective MRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 96 healthy volunteers (48 each male and female) aged 25 to 75 years and with body&#xD;
      mass index between 18.5 and 35 kg/m² will be included. In addition, 24 patients&#xD;
      (12female/12male) with type 2 diabetes will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After magnetic resonance examination, anthropometric and metabolic characterization (oral&#xD;
      glucose tolerance test) will take place.&#xD;
