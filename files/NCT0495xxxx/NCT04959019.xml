  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how effective a 6-week exercise program is for&#xD;
      improving memory compared to a no-intervention control group, investigate the brain changes&#xD;
      that may be responsible for memory improvements, and determine if the memory benefits and&#xD;
      brain changes are retained 6 weeks after completing the exercise intervention in people with&#xD;
      Idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE).&#xD;

      The primary objectives of this randomized controlled trial are to determine in adults with&#xD;
      idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) the efficacy of a 6-week supervised and structured&#xD;
      exercise program combining endurance and resistance training for memory rehabilitation,&#xD;
      investigate a putative mechanisms of action for exercise-related memory benefits, and&#xD;
      determine if the memory benefits and brain changes are retained 6 weeks after completing the&#xD;
      exercise intervention. Based on the investigators' pilot exercise data in adults with&#xD;
      epilepsy, they hypothesize that exercise will significantly improve verbal memory function in&#xD;
      the exercise group compared to the no-intervention control group. The investigators also&#xD;
      hypothesize that the verbal memory improvements are mediated by the changes in resting state&#xD;
      functional connectivity (rsFC) of the hippocampus, a brain region that plays a vital role in&#xD;
      memory function. The investigators propose a mediation model in which exercise-induced&#xD;
      changes in the hippocampus rsFC is mediating the beneficial effect of exercise on memory&#xD;
      function in epilepsy, and will utilize the causal-steps approach in which 4 conditions of&#xD;
      statistical significance must be met to determine if mediation is present.&#xD;
