      The WIL-33 study aims to determine the efficacy, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity and safety&#xD;
      of wilate as routine prophylaxis in up to 12 paediatric patients (eight evaluable) with&#xD;
      severe von Willebrand Disease VWD (defined as screening von Willebrand factor ristocetin&#xD;
      cofactor activity [VWF:RCo] &lt;20%) under the age of 6 years, over a period of 12 months.&#xD;

    <description>PK: Single dose of 80 IU/kg body weight (BW). Prophylactic treatment: 30-50 IU/kg BW administered 2-3 times per week at the recommended dose of over 12 months. Minor haemorrhage: loading dose 30-50 IU/kg BW followed by a maintenance dose of 30-40 IU/kg BW every 12-24 hours to achieve von Willebrand factor activity (VWF:Ac) and FVIII:C trough levels of &gt;30%. Major haemorrhage: loading dose 50-80 IU/kg BW followed by a maintenance dose of 30-50 IU/kg BW every 12-24 hours to achieve VWF:Ac and FVIII:C trough levels of &gt;50%. Minor surgery: loading dose of 40-60 IU/kg BW followed by a maintenance dose of 20-30 IU/kg BW every 12- 24 hours for up to 3 days, to achieve VWF:Ac peak levels of 50% after loading dose and trough levels &gt;30% during maintenance. Major surgery: loading dose of 60-80 IU/kg BW followed by a maintenance dose of 30-40 IU/kg BW every 12-24 hours for up to 6 days or longer, to achieve VWF:Ac peak levels of 100% after loading dose and trough levels &gt;50% during maintenance</description>
