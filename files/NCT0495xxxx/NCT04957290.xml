  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b/Phase 2a, open-label, multicenter study to determine the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK) and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic (PD) properties of idronoxil when rectally administered as a suppository&#xD;
      (NOX66) to patients with any solid tumor (Part 1) and patients with metastatic&#xD;
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), breast cancer (BC) and non-small-cell lung&#xD;
      cancer (NSCLC) (Part 2) who are eligible for low-dose external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) for&#xD;
      at least one symptomatic or minimally symptomatic lesion (for the prevention of symptoms).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is divided into 2 parts: Part 1 (dose escalation) and Part 2 (dose expansion). The&#xD;
      study design allows an exploration of different doses of NOX66 (800 mg, 1200 mg, 1600 mg and&#xD;
      2400 mg) with safety monitoring to ensure the safety of the patients. In Cycle 1, NOX66 will&#xD;
      be administered for 14 days followed by a 7-day rest period on a 21-day cycle. From Cycle 2&#xD;
      onwards, NOX66 will be administered for 7 days followed by a 7-day rest period on a 14-day&#xD;
      cycle. Patients will continue to receive NOX66 on a cyclical basis until disease progression,&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, start of a new anticancer therapy, withdrawal&#xD;
      of the patient by the Investigator or termination of the study by the Sponsor.&#xD;

    <description>The questionnaire assesses important functioning domains (e.g., physical, emotional, social) and common cancer symptoms (e.g., fatigue, pain, nausea, vomiting, appetite loss). The instrument is composed of 30 items. All symptom scales range from 1-4 with higher values representing higher levels of symptoms, except for the items that evaluate overall quality of life which are rated on a 7-point scale (range 1-7) where higher score represent a better quality of life.</description>

    <description>The FACT-P questionnaire is a relevant, worldwide tool used for assessing the health-related QoL in men with prostate cancer. The FACT-P is a 39-item questionnaire composed of the FACT-General (FACT-G) original subscales (Physical Well-being, Social/Family Well-being, Emotional Well-being and Functional Well-being) and a Prostate Cancer Subscale. Each item is rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). A higher score indicates a better QoL.</description>
