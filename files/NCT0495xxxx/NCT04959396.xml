    <textblock>
      One of the AUB symptoms, heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB), can lead to iron deficiency and iron&#xD;
      deficiency anemia and in acute and severe cases, can necessitate emergency medical care. This&#xD;
      study's focus is on the symptom of HMB which has a number of benign causes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigative device, the IUB SEAD™, is a novel spherical endometrial ablation device&#xD;
      developed to allow for simple, office-based chemical EA to treat benign causes of the symptom&#xD;
      of HMB. The suggested procedure is expected to be simpler than the currently available EA&#xD;
      methods and yet should still reduce the need for hysterectomy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB), involving menstrual bleeding of abnormal quantity,&#xD;
      duration, frequency, or regularity is experienced by 10-50% of women of reproductive age,&#xD;
      adversely impacts quality of life and can have substantial adverse economic impacts on&#xD;
      patients and healthcare systems. One of the AUB symptoms, heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB), can&#xD;
      lead to iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia and in acute and severe cases, can&#xD;
      necessitate emergency medical care. This study's focus is on the symptom of HMB which has a&#xD;
      number of benign causes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While pharmacologic treatment options exist, they are not always effective, and they are&#xD;
      frequently associated with both side effects and ongoing cost of care. Consequently, some&#xD;
      women desire more definitive options. Endometrial ablation (EA) is a minimally invasive&#xD;
      approach designed to manage a number of the causes of HMB and can be performed under direct&#xD;
      intrauterine vision with resectoscopic instruments or with a non-resectoscopic approach (non&#xD;
      resectoscopic endometrial ablation or NREA). For NREA, one of a number of specially designed&#xD;
      device is inserted into the endometrial cavity to deliver thermal, cryogenic or&#xD;
      radiofrequency electrical energy in an attempt to destroy the uterine lining or endometrium.&#xD;
      In some jurisdictions, NREA has become an accepted office-based procedure, but is still&#xD;
      usually performed in an institutional setting, is associated with risks associated with the&#xD;
      procedure, anesthesia, and subsequent infertility, and has a failure rate that is averages&#xD;
      about 26%. These devices are typically expensive and require training for both the surgeon&#xD;
      and the ancillary support staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigative device, the IUB SEAD™, is a novel spherical endometrial ablation device&#xD;
      developed to allow for simple, office-based chemical EA to treat benign causes of the symptom&#xD;
      of HMB. The suggested procedure is expected to be simpler than the currently available EA&#xD;
      methods and yet should still reduce the need for hysterectomy.&#xD;
