    <textblock>
      This is a long-term follow-up study to assess durability of efficacy, as measured by SVR, in&#xD;
      participants who have received prior treatment with GSK3228836 and achieved a complete or&#xD;
      partial response. No further treatment with GSK3228836 will be administered in this study.&#xD;
