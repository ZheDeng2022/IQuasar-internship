  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a prospective cohort study (n = 1.000), the investigators aim to investigate the&#xD;
      correlation between cardiac biomarkers and advanced echocardiography and determine whether&#xD;
      these are prognostic markers of heart disease in patients suffering from psoriasis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is mainly caused by atherosclerosis, now considered as a chronic&#xD;
      inflammatory disease of blood vessels. Likewise, psoriasis is a chronic and relapsing,&#xD;
      inflammatory, immune mediated disease. Atherosclerosis and psoriasis therefore share several&#xD;
      pathophysiological traits. Previous epidemiological studies have demonstrated a high&#xD;
      prevalence of cardiovascular (CV) risk factors in psoriasis patients, including metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome, cigarette smoking, obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, insulin resistance and&#xD;
      dyslipidemia(1-11). Furthermore, studies suggest that psoriasis may be an independent risk&#xD;
      factor for cardiovascular disease such as myocardial infarction(12-15), coronary artery&#xD;
      disease(9, 16, 17), stroke(18-20) and cardiovascular mortality(18, 21, 22). In addition,&#xD;
      psoriasis is associated with surrogate markers of cardiovascular disease and increased&#xD;
      platelet activity, e.g. endothelial dysfunction and coronary calcification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fundamental role of inflammation in cardiovascular disease has prompted interest in the&#xD;
      predictive capability of numerous biomarkers such as hsCRP, hsTNT, suPAR and pro-BNP that&#xD;
      detect subclinical levels of inflammation. Hence, these inflammatory biomarkers might be able&#xD;
      to reveal a pro-inflammatory disease state that represent a significant risk of CVD.&#xD;
      Likewise, novel myocardial deformation imaging echocardiography, such as Tissue Doppler&#xD;
      Imaging (TDI) and 2-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography (2DSE), have been able to&#xD;
      demonstrate subtle signs of myocardial dysfunction in high risk persons from the general&#xD;
      population despite a normal convention echocardiography(24-26). These advanced&#xD;
      echocardiographic techniques are able to detect asymptomatic reduced left ventricular&#xD;
      function, which is not visible by the naked eye. Early identification of this group of&#xD;
      patients is of utmost importance in order to initiate appropriate treatment in attempt to&#xD;
      minimize further left ventricular damage and ensure better quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By evaluating biomarkers and advanced echocardiography in a prospective study setting it&#xD;
      might be possible to establish the prevalence of cardiac dysfunction and disease in patients&#xD;
      with psoriasis and to identify patients who have miniscule signs of cardiac dysfunction and&#xD;
      therefore are in high risk of future fulminant cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Psoriasis Echo Study is a prospective cohort study consisting of a random sample of 1.000&#xD;
      consecutive patients from a population of outpatients with psoriasis and a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psoriasis patients will be recruited prospectively from the Outpatient Clinic, Department of&#xD;
      Dermato- Allergology, Herlev and Gentofte University Hospital, Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inclusion criteria: In order to approximate a random sample as accurate as possible all&#xD;
           patients 18 years or older with a diagnosis of psoriasis will be invited to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exclusion criteria: Patients not able to cooperate to the study and patients unable&#xD;
           understand and sign informed consent will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible psoriasis patients will be identified from the daily outpatient program, at the&#xD;
      Department of Dermato-Allergology, that is the department will provide the patient's contact&#xD;
      information to the project group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As most outpatient clinic psoriasis is classified as moderate to severe, in order to&#xD;
      approximate a random sample as accurate as possible including patients with mild psoriasis,&#xD;
      all people with a diagnosis of psoriasis will a general invitation to participate in the&#xD;
      study through appropriate channels such as the Danish Psoriasis Foundation's newsletter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will consist of a retrospective random sample of around 1.000 patients from&#xD;
      the general population examined in the 4th and 5th Copenhagen City Heart Study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history at baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to adjust for potential confounders, information about medical history at baseline&#xD;
      will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients agreeing to participate will return a questionnaire with general information as well&#xD;
      as information on psoriasis and possible prior heart disease. Questionnaire information will&#xD;
      include medication, psoriasis duration, previous history of CVD, symptoms of heart disease,&#xD;
      history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, family history of heart disease, alcohol&#xD;
      consumption, smoking habits and exercise habits. Data will be cross referenced to information&#xD;
      drawn from the electronic medical records in Sundhedsplatformen/Epic and will include data on&#xD;
      health conditions including symptoms, risk factors, medication, prior assessments, blood&#xD;
      tests and procedures relevant to psoriasis and potential heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnoses and/or medical history obtained from medical records will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Psoriasis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stroke&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chronic obstructive lung disease (COLD)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Periferal artery disease (PAD)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter and/or other cardiac arrythmias&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pacemaker&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diabetes type 1 and type 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Kidney disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypertension&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypercholesterolemia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Valvular disease (mitral, aortic, tricuspid and pulmonic valve disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Previous heart surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ischemic heart disease including non-invasive ischemic imaging results, prior MI, prior&#xD;
           revascularization and/or CABG&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heart failure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sleep apnea&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Thyroid disease or other metabolic disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data concerning medication will be obtained from The Danish National Prescription Registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All included participants will undergo a compressive physical examination by a dermatologist.&#xD;
      The examination will be performed at inclusion and prior to echocardiographic examination and&#xD;
      contain the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment severity of the psoriasis by the psoriasis area&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determination of severity index (PASI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other data collected at inclusion consult:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECG&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body mass index&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples, biomarkers and biobank&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be withdrawn by one of the study responsible physicians and sent for&#xD;
      immediate analysis. A total of approximately 30 ml blood will be withdrawn. Immediate&#xD;
      analyzes include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), hemoglobin level, fasting plasma glucose, ALAT, cholesterol,&#xD;
           triglyceride levels, creatinine, potassium, sodium, TSH&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specific biomarkers: HsCRP , hsTNT and proBNP&#xD;
&#xD;
      All analyzes will be performed immediately after blood withdrawal and potential left over&#xD;
      biological material will be destroyed within 24 hours If separate consent is given,&#xD;
      additional blood samples will be drawn and saved in a separate biobank for future research&#xD;
      purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GE Vingmed Ultrasound's Vivid9 (Horten, Norway) will be used to perform all echocardiograms.&#xD;
      All subjects are examined with color TDI, 2-dimensional and M-mode echocardiography,&#xD;
      conventional spectral Doppler, 2D speckle tracking and - where possible - 3D Echocardiography&#xD;
      in the left lateral decubitus position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up and outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up will be performed at 2, 5 and 10 years, starting with 2021 for the prospectively&#xD;
      included patients and starting with inclusion date for the control group, respectively.&#xD;
      Follow-up will consist of data collection on mortality using the personal identification&#xD;
      number in the Central Office of Civil Registration. Further more, data on hospitalizations&#xD;
      will be obtained from the highly validated Danish National Board of Health's Danish National&#xD;
      Patient Registry and data on causes of death will be obtained from The Danish Register of&#xD;
      Causes of Death. Follow-up data collection has been approved by The Danish Data Protection&#xD;
      Agency (P- 2020-505).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary outcomes: Cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, revascularization&#xD;
           (percutaneous coronary intervention/coronary artery bypass graft)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary outcomes: All-cause mortality, admission with cardiac heart failure (CHF) and&#xD;
           admission with stroke&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management and statistics&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be stored in a password-protected electronic research database, REDCap, The&#xD;
      Capital Region of Denmark's electronic data system. Patient questionnairs, signed consent&#xD;
      forms and other sensitive dociments will be kept in a locked archive in a locked office at&#xD;
      the Department of Cardiology, Herlev &amp; Gentofte Hospital. Approval by the Danish Data&#xD;
      Protection Agency will be obtained and all data will be handled confidentially according to&#xD;
      Danish law.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline characteristics across the primary endpoints will be compared with trend tests using&#xD;
      linear regression for continuous Gaussian distributed variables, by an extension of the&#xD;
      Wilcoxon rank-sum test fir continuous Gaussian distributed variables and by chi-square test&#xD;
      for trend for proportions. Rates of all events will be calculated as the number of events&#xD;
      divided by person-time at risk and stratified according to the primary endpoints. Hazard&#xD;
      ratios (HR) will be calculated by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Harrell's&#xD;
      C-statistics will be obtained from univariable Cox models. Non-Gaussian distributed&#xD;
      continuous variables will be categorized as dichotomous variables. The assumptions of&#xD;
      proportional haxards in the models will be tested based on the Schoenfeld residuals.&#xD;
      Predictive models for predicting the risk of future heart disease will be constructed using&#xD;
      logistic regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A p-value £ 0.05 in 2-sided test will be considered statistically significant. As the study&#xD;
      cohort is observational, a sample size calculation was not performed. As previous studies has&#xD;
      shown significant results with a sample size of around 1.000 patients, this is the chosen&#xD;
      power estimate of the current study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project significance and impact&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unrecognized heart disease:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of unrecognized heart disease in patients with psoriasis is unknown. This&#xD;
      study will address the prevalence of asymptomatic reduced left ventricular ejection fraction&#xD;
      and pathological left ventricular structure in a large random sample of outpatients with&#xD;
      psoriasis. It is of utmost importance to identify this group in due time to be able to offer&#xD;
      appropriate treatment in attempt to minimize further left ventricular damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the course of follow-up, the investigators hope to provide evidence that myocardial&#xD;
      deformation imaging in an otherwise normal conventional echocardiogram can identify patients&#xD;
      with psoriasis at risk of developing heart failure and ischemic heart disease. This will,&#xD;
      consequently, enable clinicians to encourage patients to life-style changes, stricter&#xD;
      optimization of prophylactic medical therapy, perhaps periodical echocardiograms and referral&#xD;
      of patients with very discrete symptoms to further examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the investigators expect this study to provide valuable insight in the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of deteriorating left ventricular function in psoriasis and assess the link&#xD;
      between inflammatory disease, inflammatory biomarkers and the process of atherosclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy of existing and future biomarkers to detect heart disease:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A unique research biobank with blood samples from a well-described cohort of patients with&#xD;
      psoriasis will be established. At present, the study will assess the use of existing&#xD;
      biomarkers - as outlined - and examine their ability to 1) detect cardiac involvement and 2)&#xD;
      provide prognostic information. Sufficient material will be stored with the purpose to&#xD;
      examine future possible biomarkers and gene polymorphisms.&#xD;
