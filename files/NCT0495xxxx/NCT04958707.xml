    <textblock>
      Background: The growing number of older people with dementia increases demand on informal&#xD;
      caregivers who lack information and skills, leading to a high psychological burden in care&#xD;
      provision. The proposed smartphone app-based intervention will provide a convenient and&#xD;
      feasible solution for reducing depression, stress, and anxiety among dementia carers in&#xD;
      Vietnam. This study aims to: (1) understanding the information and skills required by&#xD;
      informal carers to populate the content of the intervention and (2) test the clinical&#xD;
      feasibility of the intervention and feasibility of a fully- power randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The setting of this study is the geriatrics department in Gia Dinh People's hospital&#xD;
      in Ho Chi Minh City. The eligible participants are the informal caregivers of patients with&#xD;
      dementia living in the community, who use smartphones. Phase 1 will involve 20 interviews,&#xD;
      conducted with 20 dementia carers to determine what information and skills they need most.&#xD;
      These findings will be used to design the content of the intervention, which will comprise 8&#xD;
      weekly, online, psycho-educational, group sessions hosted on the Zalo app. Phase 2: using a&#xD;
      pilot randomized control trial design, 60 participants will be assigned to the intervention&#xD;
      or control group by the block randomization method with a ratio of 1:1. The participants will&#xD;
      complete questionnaires at baseline, post-intervention and 3 post-intervention. Outcome&#xD;
      measures include DASS21 (Depression, anxiety and stress 21), dementia understanding,&#xD;
      perceived social support, and sense of caregiver's competence. The primary outcome is the&#xD;
      feasibility of the intervention and a future fully-power randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      including acceptability and perceived effectiveness of the intervention and the rate of&#xD;
      recruitment, retention, and completion of assessments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study has two phases: the co-design of the content of the intervention (phase 1) and the&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial phase (phase 2). The setting and the participants' eligibility&#xD;
      criteria are the same for the two phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 Design: a qualitative study will be conducted on 20 caregivers of patients with&#xD;
      dementia to identify what information they most require.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: 20 face-to-face interviews will be held and guided by a trained geriatrician, in a&#xD;
      private room in the geriatrics department. The open-ended questions are used, including &quot;what&#xD;
      difficulties are the participant facing in taking care of the patient with dementia?&quot;, &quot;what&#xD;
      information do the participant need most?&quot;. Each participant will be free to share thoughts.&#xD;
      The interviews will be recorded and fully transcribed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis: The investigator will use inductive thematic content analysis. The eight most&#xD;
      common issues in which the carers need providing information will be determined to shape for&#xD;
      the intervention in phase 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 Study design A parallel-group randomized controlled pilot trial will be used with&#xD;
      equal randomization of 1:1 to test the feasibility and the acceptability of the smartphone&#xD;
      app-based intervention. Sixty dementia carers, who meet the eligible criteria and are&#xD;
      provided written informed consent, will be enrolled in the study and will be allocated to the&#xD;
      intervention or usual care group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization The eligible participants will be assigned to the intervention or control group&#xD;
      by an independent statistician, using the block randomization method (blocks of 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention The participants in the intervention group will be added to a chat room in the&#xD;
      Zalo app, created and managed by one investigator, which is named The Dementia Caregiver&#xD;
      Support group. Weekly, the investigator will post one of the eight topics identified in Phase&#xD;
      1. Before posting the information, the investigator will ask the participants what topic they&#xD;
      would like to read and discuss the week after by voting the answer. The posted information&#xD;
      will be based on evidence-based resources and consulted by geriatricians, the neurologist,&#xD;
      and the psychologist who specialize in dementia. Immediately after posting the topic, one&#xD;
      investigator will call the participants to ensure the participants read and understand the&#xD;
      post. The chat group monitor will also collect the questions or comments from the carers who&#xD;
      are encouraged to share feelings or experiences with relevant questions. Then the&#xD;
      investigator will post the answers after consulting with the experts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usual care: The participants in the control group will be introduced to the website&#xD;
      Alzheimer.org to search for eligible information Procedure The characteristics of the&#xD;
      participants (age, gender, educational level, relationship to the care recipient, time of&#xD;
      care, etc.) and other assessments will be collected by an independent investigator, who will&#xD;
      be blinded through the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures The participants will perform the Depression, anxiety and stress scale 21 (DASS21)&#xD;
      questionnaire via phone call interviews. DASS21 scale contains 21 items, evaluating 3&#xD;
      subscales including depression, anxiety, and stress states over the past week. Higher scores&#xD;
      indicate more severity of emotional states. Dementia understanding of the participants will&#xD;
      be evaluated at baseline and post-intervention by a questionnaire, originating from the&#xD;
      Northern Ireland Life and Time Survey, which was translated into Vietnamese. This&#xD;
      questionnaire contains 7 items, for example, &quot;dementia is a normal part of aging&quot; or&#xD;
      &quot;dementia can be cured&quot;. The response options will be completed with yes/no choices. Four or&#xD;
      fewer correct answers will be coded as low understanding, five correct answers medium&#xD;
      understanding, and six or more answers as high understanding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perceived social support will be assessed using the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived&#xD;
      Social Support (MSPSS), comprising 12 self-report items assessing the perceived support from&#xD;
      family, friends, or significant others (eg, &quot;There is a person who is around me when I am in&#xD;
      need). Each item is scored from 1 (very strongly disagree) to 7 (very strongly agree), based&#xD;
      on a 7-point Likert scale. Higher scores indicate higher degrees of perceived social support.&#xD;
      This scale will be translated and adapted into Vietnamese.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The caregiver's competence will be assessed based on the Short sense of competence&#xD;
      questionnaire (SSCQ). It includes 7 items evaluating 3 domains: satisfaction with the&#xD;
      demented person as a recipient of care, satisfaction with his/her own performance as a&#xD;
      caregiver, and consequences of involvement in care for the personal life of the caregiver.&#xD;
      The responses are recorded on a 5-point Likert scale. Higher scores indicate higher feelings&#xD;
      of being capable of caring for a demented person. This scale will be translated and adapted&#xD;
      into Vietnamese.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessments will be performed via phone call interviews at baseline, post-intervention,&#xD;
      and 3 months post-intervention.&#xD;
