    <textblock>
      Myocardial bridge is a congenital anatomical abnormality, which is generally considered to be&#xD;
      a benign change, but individual can cause angina, myocardial infarction and even sudden&#xD;
      death. Previously, it was believed that the degree of myocardial ischemia induced by&#xD;
      myocardial bridge was related to factors such as the location, length, and systolic stenosis&#xD;
      of the myocardial bridge shown by coronary angiography.However, in recent years, more and&#xD;
      more evidence has suggested that there is a high degree of mismatch between anatomical&#xD;
      stenosis and its function.Studies have shown that FFR and d-FFR can accurately evaluate the&#xD;
      functional significance of stenotic lesions.This study intends to enroll patients who&#xD;
      underwent coronary angiography due to chest pain and confirmed the left anterior descending&#xD;
      artery (LAD) simple myocardial bridge systolic stenosis ≥30%, and the pressure guide wire was&#xD;
      used to measure the FFR and d-FFR of the myocardial bridge lesion under static and dobutamine&#xD;
      stress.Analyze the relationship between these functional parameters and the anatomical&#xD;
      morphological characteristics of the myocardial bridge and other possible clinical&#xD;
      influencing factors, and explore the influence of the morphological characteristics of the&#xD;
      myocardial bridge on myocardial hemodynamics，so as to clarify the degree of myocardial bridge&#xD;
      shown by angiography may induce obvious myocardial ischemia, which requires clinical&#xD;
      intensive intervention.&#xD;
