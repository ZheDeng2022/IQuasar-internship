  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Biofeedback is a process that allows people to obtain information about their internal&#xD;
      physiological reactions and thereby learn to control them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers studying the brain and nervous system have found that regulating heart rate can&#xD;
      help us to relax. Controlling heart rate using biofeedback has been shown in some studies to&#xD;
      help people manage symptoms of stress such as anxiety and depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will explore whether biofeedback can help people with autism or Asperger&#xD;
      syndrome reduce reported symptoms of stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with a diagnosis of high functioning autism will be invited to use a biofeedback&#xD;
      device that helps them to regulate their heart rate. People who enrol for the study will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned different biofeedback devices. Training and support in the use of the&#xD;
      device will be provided to participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment will involve obtaining questionnaire reports from participants and their carers&#xD;
      about participant levels of anxiety, depression and sensory symptoms, demographics and&#xD;
      lifestyle. These assessments will be carried out at the beginning, in the middle and at the&#xD;
      end of the study to see if there are any differences in how each participant's heart rate&#xD;
      changes, whether there are any changes in participant's reported symptoms. Participants will&#xD;
      be asked to give daily reports on their progress to monitor stress levels, usability of&#xD;
      device and dropout rates. The overall aim is to determine whether biofeedback is a way of&#xD;
      helping people with autism to reduce symptoms of stress.&#xD;

      Based on a review of the literature, it is hypothesised that HRV biofeedback could offer a&#xD;
      means to help regulate ANS dysfunction and symptoms such as anxiety &amp; depression in people&#xD;
      with autistic spectrum disorder. To date, no studies have been identified which report on the&#xD;
      pre post measurement of HRV in autism using a longitudinal design. Furthermore, to date, no&#xD;
      published studies have reported on the use of portable HRV biofeedback devices as a potential&#xD;
      intervention for individuals with autism to help manage symptoms such as anxiety &amp;&#xD;
      depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An initial usability evaluation has been carried out and approved by Ulster University&#xD;
      faculty of Life &amp; Health sciences in 2014 to determine the timings required to undertake the&#xD;
      assessment and assess usability of equipment, measures, physiological assessment sensors and&#xD;
      recording of data (see appendix I for a summary). The current study aims to assess the&#xD;
      feasibility of employing a technology intervention for people with autism using small&#xD;
      portable HRV biofeedback devices to help manage symptoms such as anxiety. Because of the&#xD;
      differences in physiology seen in many people with autism, any study aiming to understand a&#xD;
      potential new intervention for this population should include pre and post intervention&#xD;
      assessments of they react physiologically and respond to information. This study will&#xD;
      therefore use pre and post questionnaire assessment from participants and their carers, but&#xD;
      will also record participant's heart rate variability pre and post intervention to assess any&#xD;
      changes in participants underlying physiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim To understand the use of heart rate variability biofeedback in people with autistic&#xD;
      spectrum disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To provide a home based HRV biofeedback intervention to people with autistic spectrum&#xD;
           disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To collect data from participants and their carers on participant anxiety, depression&#xD;
           and physiological arousal before and after using a biofeedback device.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the adoption of HRV biofeedback technology in terms of user acceptance and&#xD;
           levels of dropout.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To evaluate the risks and benefits of this technology in terms of stress management.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To develop recommendations on the use of HRV biofeedback for people with autistic&#xD;
           spectrum disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology The study will follow the revised MRC guidelines for the development and&#xD;
      evaluation of complex interventions, namely a feasibility and piloting study which will look&#xD;
      at dropout rates, test methodology and procedure, and determine the size of sample that would&#xD;
      eventually be needed to obtain estimates of effect size in a full scale randomised trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design The study is essentially a clinical trial that involves a detailed follow up of a&#xD;
      sample of people with autistic spectrum disorder (n=39, IQ&gt;70) using repeated measures in a&#xD;
      randomised control experimental design.&#xD;

It involves a detailed follow up of a clinical sample of people with highfunctioning autism, using repeated measures in a randomized control experimental design. Intervention participants will be given a biofeedback device and training immediately, whilst the control group will wait 6 weeks and then receive the intervention. This will help to increase participation and maximize the detailed data collection that is required</intervention_model_description>
