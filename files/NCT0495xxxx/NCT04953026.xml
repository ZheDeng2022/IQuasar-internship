  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study intends to study the shoulder SLAP injury through deep learning technology and&#xD;
      establish a deep learning model through the combination of axial and oblique coronal images&#xD;
      to establish a deep learning method that can accurately identify and grade shoulder SLAP&#xD;
      injury.&#xD;

      1. Recognition of labrum images based on LeNet: axial and oblique coronal T2-fs images were&#xD;
           used, and all images were corrected and standardized. LeNet identified the images with&#xD;
           labrum of the shoulder joint, and the images with labrum structure of shoulder joint&#xD;
           were selected from the complete sequence. In contrast, the images without labrum&#xD;
           structure were deleted. All the data are divided into a training set (70%, 30% in&#xD;
           training set as verification set), and the remaining 30% as a test set to evaluate the&#xD;
           accuracy of model recognition. Enter the obtained results into the next step.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Recognition and segmentation of glenoid lip of shoulder joint based on DenseNet: the&#xD;
           labrum is recognized by DenseNet in the selected image. The labelimg software based on&#xD;
           Python was used to locate the labrum coordinates and then input them into Python for&#xD;
           recognition learning. All the data were divided into a training set (70% and 30% of the&#xD;
           training set were selected as the verification set). The remaining 30% was used as the&#xD;
           test set to evaluate the accuracy of model recognition. After identifying the labrum&#xD;
           structure, the labrum structure is locally cut and enlarged to remove the redundant&#xD;
           information and improve the recognition efficiency and accuracy. Finally, input the&#xD;
           result to the next step.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Recognition and grading of shoulder SLAP injury based on 3D-CNN: recognition and grading&#xD;
           of input data through 3D-CNN model. 3D-CNN is divided into eight layers: input layer,&#xD;
           hard wire layer H1, convolution layer C2, downsampling layer S3, convolution layer C4,&#xD;
           downsampling layer S5, convolution layer C6 and output layer. 3D-CNN constructs a cube&#xD;
           by stacking multiple consecutive frames and then uses a 3D convolution kernel in the&#xD;
           cube. Through this structure, the feature images in the convolution layer will be&#xD;
           connected with multiple adjacent frames in the previous layer to realize the information&#xD;
           acquisition of continuous images. Similarly, the data is divided into a training set&#xD;
           (70%, and then 30% of the training set is selected as the verification set), and the&#xD;
           remaining 30% is used as the test set to evaluate the classification accuracy to&#xD;
           identify whether there is labrum injury and grade the image with injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Establish CNN combined model: after establishing the model for the axial and oblique&#xD;
           coronal view according to the above process (1-3), according to the output&#xD;
           characteristics of the CNN classification model, predict the probability of different&#xD;
           grades before the output results, and the output results are based on these&#xD;
           probabilities to select the expression form of the maximum possible probability. Our&#xD;
           combined model averages the probabilities of these different classifications, calculates&#xD;
           the final prediction probability, and then obtains the final joint model. The test set&#xD;
           of the third step (including the mixed data of axial and coronal images) was used to&#xD;
           verify the joint model.&#xD;
