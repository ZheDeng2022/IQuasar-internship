    <textblock>
      Neostigmine is commonly used for medical treatment of acute colonic pseudo obstruction,&#xD;
      however, the ideal route of administration has not been determined. Though IV push works&#xD;
      rapidly, it is likely associated with the most side effects. This study will compare the&#xD;
      efficacy and side effect profile of 3 potential routes of administration: IV push, IV&#xD;
      continuous infusion, and subcutaneous.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction (ACPO) is a severe form of colonic ileus seen in patients&#xD;
      hospitalized with a variety of medical and surgical conditions. The most serious complication&#xD;
      is spontaneous colonic perforation, which occurs in 3% of cases with a mortality rate of up&#xD;
      to 50%. The risk of perforation is greater in those patients with a cecal diameter &gt;12 cm,&#xD;
      although the duration of dilation might be more important than the cecal diameter. A&#xD;
      significant number of patients will respond to the conservative measures enumerated in the&#xD;
      abstract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopic decompression of the dilated colon is undertaken commonly to prevent spontaneous&#xD;
      perforation. However, it is performed under suboptimal conditions (unprepared and distended&#xD;
      colon) increasing the risk of complications with a morbidity rate of 3% and a mortality rate&#xD;
      of 1%. Furthermore, although effective initially in 69% of cases, 40% of them will have at&#xD;
      least one recurrence. To decrease this recurrence rate, endoscopic placement of a drainage&#xD;
      tube is now advocated. Patients who fail to respond to conservative therapy and colonoscopic&#xD;
      decompression will require surgery, which has a mortality rate of up to 26%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an effort to find a more effective, noninvasive therapy, Ponec et al., introduced and&#xD;
      highlighted the effect of IV neostigmine (2 mg over 3-5 min). Neostigmine was significantly&#xD;
      more effective than placebo in rapidly decreasing colonic dilation in the majority of&#xD;
      patients with ACPO. Although it has a short half-life, a single IV dose of 2 mg of&#xD;
      neostigmine was sufficient in most cases to restore colonic motility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to be aware of contraindications to using parasympathetic agents, including&#xD;
      bradyarrhythmia and history of bronchospasm. Patients need to be monitored while neostigmine&#xD;
      is infused, and atropine should be available in the event of complications. Patients with&#xD;
      renal insufficiency might be at higher risk of complications as a significant quantity of the&#xD;
      drug is excreted in urine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In light of these contraindications, administration by the subcutaneous (SQ) route has been&#xD;
      utilized intermittently for ACPO. Data for use of SQ administration of neostigmine in adult&#xD;
      patients are limited to one multi-institutional observational study, one case series, and two&#xD;
      case reports in acute medical and palliative care patients. Although these case reports&#xD;
      describe a range of dosing, the SQ route of administration appears to be attractive&#xD;
      alternative to IV administration for this indication, with a time to effect of 8 to 10 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a prospective randomized non-inferiority trial that seeks to analyze the&#xD;
      success of three different routes of neostigmine administration, sub-cutaneous, IV push, and&#xD;
      IV infusion for safety and efficacy in the ACPO patient population.&#xD;
