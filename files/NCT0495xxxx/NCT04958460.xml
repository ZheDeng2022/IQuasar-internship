  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder. Gut&#xD;
      microbiome dysbiosis may be associated with the pathophysiology of ADHD. Investigators&#xD;
      previously found the relative abundance of Sutterella stercoricanis were increased and&#xD;
      Bifidobacterium bifidum were decreased in the ADHD group. Investigators hypothesize that ADHD&#xD;
      patients receiving supplementary Bifidobacterium bifidum (Bf-688) is able to increase the&#xD;
      proportion of Bf-688; inhibit the proportion of Sutterella; and improve ADHD symptoms.&#xD;

      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will conduct an open-label, single arm study and a randomized, double-blind&#xD;
      clinical trial to examine whether Bf-688 can achieve similar effects to therapeutic drugs for&#xD;
      ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of this clinical trial is expected to be 2 years (March 2020 to February 2022).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In the first stage of study, investigators will conduct an open-label, single arm study.&#xD;
           Investigators will recruit 30 children aged 4-16 who are diagnosed as ADHD who are&#xD;
           eligible to participate in the trial. The patients will be administrated with Bf-688, 1&#xD;
           pack each morning and evening (5×109 colony forming units (CFUs) per day) for 8 weeks.&#xD;
           At the baseline, 2nd, 4th and 8th week, the clinical symptoms of ADHD will be evaluated&#xD;
           using the SNAP-IV and ADHD-RS. At weeks 0 and 8, blood samples and fecal samples will be&#xD;
           collected and psychological tests will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In the second stage of study, This clinical trial is a prospective, randomized,&#xD;
           double-blind, parallel-controlled clinical trial for children aged 6-12 years old who&#xD;
           are diagnosis of ADHD and who are currently receiving ADHD drug therapy. A total of 120&#xD;
           patients will be recruited in this trial. All subjects will be randomly assigned&#xD;
           (allocation ratio 1:1) to one of the following two groups (60 people in each group):&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1) Probiotics group: The original ADHD drug will be continuously used, and the Bf-688 packet&#xD;
      (5×109 CFUs) will be administrated in the morning and in the evening daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (2) Placebo group: The original ADHD drug will be continuously used, and the placebo packet&#xD;
      will be administrated in the morning and in the evening daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will take the above prescription for 12 consecutive weeks. At the 0th, 4th, 8th,&#xD;
      and 12th weeks, parents and teachers will be asked to fill SNAP-IV, and the researcher will&#xD;
      use ADHD-RS to evaluate the clinical symptoms of ADHD. At the 0th week and 12th week, stool&#xD;
      samples will be collected and psychological tests will be performed (CPT and CATA). Nucleic&#xD;
      acid sequencing technology is used to identify bacterial species in feces, and&#xD;
      high-throughput 16S rRNA sequences can be quickly obtained through Next Generation Sequencing&#xD;
      (NGS), and fecal metabolites analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators expect to find that Bf-688 exhibit significant better effects than the placebo&#xD;
      group for treating ADHD patients. This result will validate that gut microbiota modification&#xD;
      may be beneficial for the behavioral symptoms of ADHD children, and the outcome may have the&#xD;
      potential for patent and commercialization.&#xD;
