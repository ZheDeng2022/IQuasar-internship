  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of progressive relaxation exercises applied&#xD;
      to nurses working in the intensive care unit three times a week for 1 month on sleep quality&#xD;
      and severity of fatigue. The research is a pretest-posttest randomized controlled study with&#xD;
      an intervention control group.&#xD;

      The Effect of Progressive Relaxation Exercises Applied to Nurses Working in The İntensive&#xD;
      Care Unit on Sleep Quality and Fatique İntensity The study was planned to determine the&#xD;
      effect of progressive relaxation exercises applied to nurses working in intensive care units&#xD;
      on sleep quality and fatigue intensity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted with a randomized controlled experimental research design in&#xD;
      order to evaluate the effect of progressive relaxation exercises applied to nurses working in&#xD;
      the intensive care unit on sleep quality and fatigue intensity. This randomized controlled&#xD;
      study will be conducted on nurses working in Adana City Training and Research Hospital&#xD;
      Intensive Care Unit. Nurses will be divided into 2 groups as experiment and control. It will&#xD;
      be carried out on 60 people in total, 30 for the experimental group, 30 for the control&#xD;
      group. Progressive relaxation exercises will be applied by nurses for 45 minutes, 3 days a&#xD;
      week for an average of 1 month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data of the study will be collected after the purpose of the study is explained to the&#xD;
      nurses and their verbal and written consents are obtained. In the collection of research&#xD;
      data, the Personal Information Form prepared by the researchers and containing the&#xD;
      introductory information of the nurses, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (Pittsburgh Sleep&#xD;
      Quality Index Scale PSQI), the Fatigue Severity Scale for fatigue (FSS) will be collected&#xD;
      from control and intervention groups through face-to-face interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are a limited number of studies showing the effects of progressive relaxation exercises&#xD;
      applied to intensive care nurses on sleep quality and fatigue intensity in our country. With&#xD;
      the study, the use of these exercise programs, which can be easily applied by nurses who work&#xD;
      under heavy workloads in the intensive care environment, will increase, and it will be&#xD;
      ensured that nurses work more fit and efficiently and are supported in terms of sleep&#xD;
      fatigue.&#xD;

    <description>Fatigue severity scale The scale developed by Krup (1989) is a nine-item scale that evaluates the overall effect of fatigue on daily activities.In the scale, individuals are asked to rate the fatigue they have felt during the past week from 1 to 7. The total score is calculated by taking the average of nine items. The cut-off value for pathological fatigue was determined as 4 and above. The lower the total score, the less fatigue.</description>

    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PUKI, PSQI) was developed in 1989 by Buysse et al. (Buysee et al, 1989) to evaluate sleep quality in the last month. The scale consists of a total of 24 questions, 19 of which were answered by the individual and five of them by the relatives of the individual.Each item score varies between &quot;0&quot; and &quot;3&quot;, and the sum of the scores of the items in the seven components gives the scale score of 18.The total PUKI score ranges from 0 to 21. If this score is above 5, it indicates that the sleep quality of the individual is poor.</description>
