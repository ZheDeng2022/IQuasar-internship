  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to investigate the utility of the new investigational&#xD;
      imaging agent ⁸⁹Zr Df-IAB22M2C (CD8 PET/CT tracer) to monitor CD8 T-cell expansion and&#xD;
      trafficking within tumors and associated tissues in patients with metastatic melanoma&#xD;
      undergoing treatment with bempegaldesleukin and nivolumab as a single agent and in&#xD;
      combination.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NKTR-214 is a cytokine (Investigational Agent), a protein which is found to expand certain&#xD;
      immune cells (known as CD8+ T Cells and Natural Killer Cells) to promote their anti-tumor&#xD;
      effects. Nivolumab is a full human monoclonal antibody that binds to a molecule called PD-1&#xD;
      (programmed cell death protein 1) on immune cells and promotes anti-tumor effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ⁸⁹Zr Df-IAB22M2C is an experimental injected molecule containing a radioactive atom; this&#xD;
      molecule attaches to CD8+ T cells and allows those T cells to be seen on PET/CT scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: A total of 4 eligible patients will be enrolled into part 1. During Cycle 1, patients&#xD;
      will receive single agent NKTR-214, 3 injections ⁸⁹Zr Df-IAB22M2C , and 6 PET/CT scans.&#xD;
      Starting with Cycle 2, patients will receive NKTR-214 in combination with nivolumab q3w for&#xD;
      the remainder of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the PET/CT imaging data from Part 1 have been reviewed, Part 2 will open for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: A total of 20 eligible patient will be enrolled into part 2. During Cycle 1, patients&#xD;
      will receive single agent NKTR-214 or nivolumab, 2 injections of ⁸⁹Zr Df-IAB22M2C , and 3&#xD;
      PET/CT scans. In Cycle 2 and beyond, patients will receive NKTR-214 in combination with&#xD;
      nivolumab q3w for the remainder of the study. During Cycle 2, patients will receive 1&#xD;
      injection of ⁸⁹Zr Df-IAB22M2C and 1 PET/CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients enrolled in the study will be closely monitored to determine if there is&#xD;
      response to the treatment as well as for any side effects that may occur. The efficacy of the&#xD;
      combination will be assessed using objective response rate (ORR). Exploratory immunological&#xD;
      biomarkers in plasma and tumor samples will evaluate immune activation.&#xD;
