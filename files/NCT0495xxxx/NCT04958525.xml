    <textblock>
      To compare the prognosis of patients with hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage treated by&#xD;
      two different surgical methods, and to clarify the therapeutic effect of minimally invasive&#xD;
      surgery, so as to find a better surgical method that can reduce surgical trauma and mortality&#xD;
      and improve the prognosis of patients&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In this study, a cohort observation method was adopted to observe a total of 52 patients who&#xD;
      underwent two surgical procedures, namely, removal of hematoma in basal ganglo-region by&#xD;
      keyhole neuroendoscopy under frontal ultrasound guidance and removal of hematoma by&#xD;
      craniotomy microsurgery. They were divided into the endoscopic surgery group and the&#xD;
      microsurgery group. In the endoscopic surgery group, 26 patients underwent removal of&#xD;
      hematoma in basal ganglo-region by keyhole neuroendoscopy under frontal ultrasound&#xD;
      guidance.In the microsurgery group, 26 cases were treated with craniotomy microsurgery for&#xD;
      hematoma removal. The clearance rate of surgical hematoma, surgical safety, GCS score, GOS&#xD;
      score, nerve fiber injury and postoperative complications were observed in the two groups 1&#xD;
      week, 1 month and 3 months after surgery.To observe and analyze whether endoscopic surgery&#xD;
      group has advantages in improving hematoma clearance rate and efficacy&#xD;
