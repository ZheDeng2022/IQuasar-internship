  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines&#xD;
      in:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • People with prior COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2 infection) who were in the ACTIV-2/A5401 study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      And&#xD;
&#xD;
      • People who have never had COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2 infection).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is for people who had COVID-19 and participated in ACTIV-2/A5401 and received&#xD;
      either experimental treatment, a standard of care COVID-19 treatment, or placebo. This study&#xD;
      is also for people who have not previously had a COVID-19 infection. The study is designed to&#xD;
      evaluate how the immune system responds to mRNA-COVID-19 vaccines in these participants. The&#xD;
      safety of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in persons with prior COVID-19 who did and did not receive&#xD;
      prior experimental treatment for COVID-19 will be explored. Prior infection with or without&#xD;
      treatment could increase, decrease, or have no significant effect on the response to mRNA&#xD;
      COVID-19 vaccines, as well as the risk of side effects from these vaccines. Immune responses&#xD;
      of participants who have not previously been infected with COVID-19 will be compared to those&#xD;
      who have previously had COVID-19.&#xD;
