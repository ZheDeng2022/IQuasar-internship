  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral venous cannulation (insertion of a drip line into a vein) is a fundamental&#xD;
      component of anaesthesia for both children and adults alike. Discomfort caused by needle&#xD;
      insertion is a common worry for children but one simple intervention that may be delivered&#xD;
      prior to a needle insertion procedure, is the application of topical analgesia (numbing skin&#xD;
      cream). Several creams are now available and have been found to be effective in several&#xD;
      trials of awake children. Yet the value of these creams for children receiving an&#xD;
      inhalational induction of anaesthesia (gas to go off to sleep before needle insertion)&#xD;
      remains uncertain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study are to determine whether cream application prior to receiving gas to&#xD;
      go off to sleep has any beneficial effects (outcomes) for children, including reduction of&#xD;
      movement, improved needle success rates and reduced time required for needle insertion&#xD;
      procedures. How frequently skin effects after application of the creams occur (swelling,&#xD;
      redness, itchiness) will also be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be performed as a retrospective observational study (a study which looks back&#xD;
      in time, identifies groups of exposed (cream applied) or non-exposed (no cream applied)&#xD;
      children and follows them over a period of time to see how their exposures affect their&#xD;
      outcomes). Using a total population (purposive) sampling technique, 500 children from 1 month&#xD;
      to 18 years of age undergoing elective (planned) or urgent (emergency) inhalational induction&#xD;
      of anaesthesia (gas to go off to sleep) at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust over a&#xD;
      six month study period (August 2020 to January 2021) will be incorporated into a completely&#xD;
      anonymised research dataset and analysed to determine whether topical analgesia (skin numbing&#xD;
      cream) application prior to inhalational induction (gas to go off to sleep) may offer any&#xD;
      beneficial effects for paediatric patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be performed as a retrospective cohort observational study (a study which&#xD;
      looks back in time, identifies cohorts (groups) of 'exposed' (those who received topical&#xD;
      analgesia (skin numbing cream)) and 'non-exposed' (those who did not receive topical&#xD;
      analgesia (skin numbing cream)) children and follows them over a period of time to see how&#xD;
      their exposures affect their outcomes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since no studies have been conducted to date, to determine the value of topical analgesia&#xD;
      (skin numbing cream) for children receiving an inhalational induction of anaesthesia (gas to&#xD;
      go off to sleep), this has been designed as a non-randomised preparatory study. Being&#xD;
      non-experimental in nature, this study will attempt to evaluate preliminary null hypotheses&#xD;
      of association. Where association(s) and/or potential benefit(s) are observed to a&#xD;
      statistically significant level, the value and feasibility of a future experimental study, in&#xD;
      the form of a prospective randomised controlled trial, will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through acting as a first step in exploring a novel intervention, this approach is felt to&#xD;
      offer a safe and cost-effective indication of the value a future large-scale experimental&#xD;
      trial, which in an uninvestigated field and with only a suggestible potential for benefit,&#xD;
      would face numerous approval challenges.&#xD;
