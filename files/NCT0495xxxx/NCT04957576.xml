      Some pathological clinical conditions can strongly perturb the link between body and self.&#xD;
      One disorder of body representation is the feeling of disownership over body parts,&#xD;
      experienced by neurological patients usually after a stroke affecting the right hemisphere.&#xD;
      Body disownership and more complex somatoparaphrenic delusions are described as rare in the&#xD;
      scientific literature and no clear consensus about their features, brain correlates and&#xD;
      recovery mechanisms are on record. Recently, the investigators have discovered that using new&#xD;
      sensitive tools it is possible to unveil the presence of covert disownership deficits in&#xD;
      patients, who seemed completely unimpaired at the standard assessment. Within a bigger&#xD;
      exploratory study of this covert disownership in stroke patients, the aim is to implement a&#xD;
      proof-of-concept rehabilitation study, using a multisensory stimulation paradigm, with the&#xD;
      hypothesis that a positive remission of disownership will be found and that this treatment&#xD;
      can influence both the implicit and explicit features of disownership.&#xD;

      In normal conditions, humans build the feeling that the &quot;real me&quot; or the &quot;I&quot; is the subject&#xD;
      of perception, action and thought and, therefore, that conscious experiences are linked to a&#xD;
      unitary entity, the &quot;self&quot;. This is what is called self-consciousness. It is also known that&#xD;
      the self &quot;resides&quot; in the body: the link between the self and the body (i.e., bodily&#xD;
      self-consciousness, BSC) is guaranteed by the integration of multiple signals coming from&#xD;
      outside (e.g., visual, tactile information) and inside (i.e., interoceptive signals such as&#xD;
      the heartbeat) the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurological damage and/or dysfunctions can affect our self-consciousness at different&#xD;
      levels, implying bodily features or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Somatoparaphrenia (SP) is a neuropsychological condition in which patients usually experience&#xD;
      the feeling that one or more body parts do not belong to them anymore (i.e., disownership),&#xD;
      with the frequent delusional attribution to another person. This term originates from the&#xD;
      Greek: παρα + φρεν, φρενos means &quot;against the mind&quot;, and σωμα, σωματos refers to the &quot;body&quot;.&#xD;
      SP patients have been described starting with the end of the 19th century, but only in 1942&#xD;
      Gerstmann introduced the term &quot;somatoparaphrenic symptoms&quot;, which are defined as: &quot;illusions&#xD;
      or distortions concerning the perception of, and confabulations or delusions referring to the&#xD;
      affected limbs or side&quot; (p. 895), and &quot;specific psychic elaboration with respect to the&#xD;
      affected members or side of the body, believed or experienced as absent&quot; (p. 912).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Very often, these bodily delusion affects the left hemi-body, after a right-brain lesion,&#xD;
      even if cases of &quot;crossed somatoparaphrenia&quot; (i.e., left-brain lesion and SP affecting the&#xD;
      right hemi-body) are on record. A distal-to-proximal gradient in the disownership&#xD;
      manifestations has been detected, with the hand being more often affected, followed by the&#xD;
      limbs (arm/leg) and only rarely the whole hemi-body. Specific reports about SP affecting the&#xD;
      face are not on record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While SP has sometimes a delusional component, disownership is the most frequent&#xD;
      manifestation of patients: when pure disownership is detected in patients, the disorder has&#xD;
      been also called asomatognosia. Different symptoms can include the feeling of estrangement&#xD;
      for the affected body part, or more complex delusional misidentifications of the impaired&#xD;
      hemi-body, but more rarely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurological deficits are often concomitant to disownership: while visual deficits are not&#xD;
      systematically associated with SP, hemiplegia and hemianaesthesia for the affected body parts&#xD;
      are very frequently reported, even if rare cases of SP with unimpaired motor and tactile&#xD;
      deficits are on record. Position sense, i.e. the capacity to localise the body in space, has&#xD;
      been identified as the neurological symptom strongly associated with SP: only a little number&#xD;
      of SP patients have the unimpaired proprioceptive ability, and usually these patients do not&#xD;
      show the classical disownership manifestations, but a more complex bodily delusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The traditional SP deficit is quite rare: indeed, the scientific literature is done of a&#xD;
      collection of case reports and rare small group studies. This results in a major difficulty&#xD;
      in interpreting the symptoms and generalizing the acquired knowledge to a general theoretical&#xD;
      framework. One of the consequences is that, while this disorder strongly perturbs the link&#xD;
      between body and self, being in its delusional forms very disrupting for patients (i.e., some&#xD;
      patients develop hate towards the &quot;foreign&quot; body part, with verbal and physical attacks), no&#xD;
      rehabilitation protocol has been developed. The investigators have performed a first&#xD;
      promising study into this direction proposing a multisensory paradigm to induce the remission&#xD;
      of SP but, due to the rarity of the deficit, only two patients have been included. Recently,&#xD;
      the investigators have shown that disownership symptoms are not so rare, but depend on the&#xD;
      assessment tool. SP is usually detected by a verbal semi-structured interview, in which the&#xD;
      examiner asks the patients to state the ownership of some specific ipsilesional (as control)&#xD;
      and controlesional (impaired) body parts. In a recently published study, the investigators&#xD;
      have unveiled a subtle form of disownership present in patients that correctly acknowledge&#xD;
      the ownership of the body with the standard interview. Indeed, using a vertical visual&#xD;
      analogue scale (VAS), the investigators have discovered that patients with right-brain-lesion&#xD;
      perceived a (sometimes drastically) reduced feeling of ownership of body parts, especially of&#xD;
      the left upper limb, even in the chronic phase post-stroke. The investigators have therefore&#xD;
      proposed the presence of multiple categories of body ownership disorders, based on the&#xD;
      patients' behaviours at the direct explicit standard interview, and at the visual analogue&#xD;
      scale, which is a quantitative more graduated tool, but not declarative. The rare SP deficit,&#xD;
      i.e. the &quot;overt&quot; disownership, has been currently associated with a &quot;covert&quot; disownership&#xD;
      deficit. The first dataset about the covert deficit suggests that it occurs in about 25% of&#xD;
      patients in the subacute and chronic phase after the stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present proof-of-concept study, the aim is to acquire preliminary evidence of the&#xD;
      possibility to restore a normal link between the body and the self in patients. The use of&#xD;
      the visuo-tactile rubber hand illusion paradigm will be proposed, as the investigators have&#xD;
      shown to be effective in SP patients: however, this previous study tested only two patients,&#xD;
      considering the difficulty of detecting disownership deficits with an overt assessment, and&#xD;
      no other follow-up experiments analysed the potential of this rehabilitative tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will select 5 patients with right-hemispheric damage and covert&#xD;
      disownership as assessed with a baseline neuropsychological evaluation. During this&#xD;
      experimental session, participants will undergo a modified rubber hand illusion session. In&#xD;
      previous research, the investigators have applied this paradigm to the study of body&#xD;
      ownership in patients with personal neglect and with SP. In the present proof-of-concept, the&#xD;
      investigators will apply the same paradigm to patients with covert disownership: considering&#xD;
      that the left hand of patients is not completely recognized as their own hand, but there is a&#xD;
      (more or less severe) disownership, it will be used as if it was a fake rubber hand. The&#xD;
      patient will place both hands on a table in front of him/her, seeing only the left one&#xD;
      disown. At first, an asynchronous (control) stimulation will be done, with the right (out of&#xD;
      view, but perceiving the tactile stimulation) and left (in full view, but with somato-sensory&#xD;
      deficits, therefore not feeling the stimulation) hands touched with a paintbrush&#xD;
      asynchronously (i.e., with a time-delay between the two hands) for five minutes. After the&#xD;
      asynchronous session, the experimenter will stimulate synchronously both the right and left&#xD;
      hands for five minutes. The order of the stimulations (asynchronous and synchronous) will not&#xD;
      be randomized, as the investigators have previously shown that the synchronous stimulation&#xD;
      can be effective. Before and after each visuo-tactile stimulation, three trials of the VAS&#xD;
      regarding the left and the right hands, as well some standard explicit questions assessing&#xD;
      the presence of the illusion, will be administered. Moreover, an experimental task assessing&#xD;
      the implicit body awareness (Implicit Association Test, IAT), will be administered before and&#xD;
      after the synchronous visuo-tactile stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each session will last maximum 2h15min (asynchronous stimulation + IAT + synchronous&#xD;
      stimulation + IAT ). The follow-up daily VAS testing will last 10 minutes.&#xD;
