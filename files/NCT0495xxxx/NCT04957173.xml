  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a pilot study carried out to assess the feasibility, safety and effectiveness&#xD;
      of an intensive lifestyle intervention, implemented virtually by a multidisciplinary team, in&#xD;
      patients living with advanced insulin-treated T2DM. This 24-week study will include 2&#xD;
      pre-intervention virtual visits and 15 virtual visits during the intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) has increased rapidly over the past decades. This&#xD;
      chronic condition, strongly associated with abdominal obesity, leads to serious&#xD;
      complications. Traditional recommendations for the management of T2DM mainly suggest the use&#xD;
      of drugs to control blood sugar and the concomitant risk factors. However, this approach can&#xD;
      be expensive and some therapies have significant side effects. Although programs aimed at&#xD;
      improving lifestyle habits are essential in the management of T2DM, the implementation of&#xD;
      these programs involves many challenges such as the need for patients to travel and access to&#xD;
      a multidisciplinary team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A few studies have recently proposed that one can induce remission of T2DM. Considering that&#xD;
      this disease appears to be the result of metabolic stress induced by an excessive&#xD;
      accumulation of fat in the internal organs, the reduction of this excess of lipids by a&#xD;
      significant weight loss could reduce the metabolic stress and modify the progression of the&#xD;
      disease. disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The implementation of a virtual lifestyle intervention could make it possible to follow up&#xD;
      patients who do not have access to a multidisciplinary team nearby or who are unable to&#xD;
      travel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this project is to assess the feasibility of the nutritional intervention by&#xD;
      measuring food intake, eating behaviors and factors facilitating or limiting adherence to the&#xD;
      intervention. As well as to examine the effect of this intervention on weight loss and waist&#xD;
      circumference; doses of insulin and other drugs to treat T2DM, dyslipidemia and high blood&#xD;
      pressure; glycemic control and possible complications; eating behaviors and quality of life.&#xD;
