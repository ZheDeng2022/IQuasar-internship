  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Locoregional anesthesia techniques are now widely recommended in perioperative multimodal&#xD;
      analgesia protocols. The transverse abdominal plane block (TAP block), which consists of the&#xD;
      injection of a local anesthetic in the vascular-nervous plane between the internal oblique&#xD;
      muscle and the transverse abdominal muscle, has seen a significant increase in abdominal&#xD;
      surgery with the advent of ultrasound guidance. Aimed at blocking the nerves destined to the&#xD;
      antero-lateral abdominal wall, it has shown a benefit in several abdominopelvic surgeries&#xD;
      with in particular a reduction of pain and a morphine sparing during the 24 postoperative&#xD;
      hours as well as a shortening of the delay of resumption of the intestinal transit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ropivacaine is the molecule of choice in transverse abdominal plane block because of its&#xD;
      better safety profile among long-acting local anesthetics. Nevertheless, transverse abdominal&#xD;
      plane block using ropivacaine has a risk of systemic toxicity, correlated to the peak&#xD;
      systemic resorption of the local anesthetic, whose low incidence is probably underestimated&#xD;
      in patients under general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, the addition of diluted adrenaline to the ropivacaine solution is a common&#xD;
      practice in loco-regional anesthesia, including transverse abdominal plane block, to increase&#xD;
      the duration of the peripheral block and reduce the peak plasma concentration of the local&#xD;
      anesthetic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of our study is to compare the pharmacokinetics of total and free ropivacaine&#xD;
      administered in transverse abdominal plane block at the minimum effective dosage of 1 mg/kg&#xD;
      without and with the addition of epinephrine at the concentration of 1:200000 (5 µg/mL) in&#xD;
      patients scheduled for laparoscopic colectomy. The hypothesis is a significant reduction in&#xD;
      the mean maximum concentration (Cmax) of total or free plasma ropivacaine in the adrenalized&#xD;
      block transverse abdominal plane group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The practical applications in case of verification of the hypothesis are the provision of an&#xD;
      argument to recommend the systematic adrenalization of the transverse abdominal plane block&#xD;
      with ropivacaine in the interest of patient safety and the prospect of a downward&#xD;
      reassessment of the minimum time to be respected between the administration of a transverse&#xD;
      abdominal plane block with ropivacaine and that of another locoregional anesthesia.&#xD;
