    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the implementation and real-world effects of an intervention&#xD;
      for harmful use of alcohol and psychoactive medicinal drugs among hospital inpatients. Due to&#xD;
      the negative impact of alcohol consumption on health outcomes, a call for action has been&#xD;
      made by the Norwegian Ministry of Health, with focus on screening patients for alcohol&#xD;
      consumption and evidence-based tailored interventions for those with medium or high&#xD;
      consumption. In addition, non-prescribed use of psychoactive medicinal drugs, or concomitant&#xD;
      use with alcohol, can also have negative health effects, therefore improved monitoring of the&#xD;
      use of these are warranted. Interventions will be introduced as routine procedures at&#xD;
      Norwegian hospitals in the upcoming year, and 2500 patients receiving acute medical care will&#xD;
      be included in the control group before the intervention is implemented, and 2500 patients in&#xD;
      the case group after the implementation is effectuated. This study will evaluate the&#xD;
      implementation process using baseline data on self-reported alcohol- and psychoactive&#xD;
      medicine use, motivation to reduce consumption and mental distress. In addition, left-over&#xD;
      blood samples used for diagnostic purposes will be collected and analyzed for alcohol,&#xD;
      psychoactive medicinal and illicit drugs. After 12 months baseline data will be coupled to&#xD;
      patient journal data and relevant registry data in order to evaluate the effects of the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients included in the study before the implementation of the intervention protocols will&#xD;
      be assigned to the control group. These patients will receive acute medical care according to&#xD;
      current procedures. Patients included in the study after implementation of intervention&#xD;
      protocols will be assigned to the case group. In addition to acute medical care, these&#xD;
      patients will be routinely screened for harmful alcohol consumption using Alcohol Use&#xD;
      Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT-C). Patients scoring &lt; 4 points (men) / 3 points (women)&#xD;
      will not receive any intervention. Patients scoring 4-6 points (men) / 3-5 points (women)&#xD;
      will be informed about the possible harmful effects of their consumption and will be advised&#xD;
      to reduce their consumption. From patients scoring &gt; 6 points (men) &gt;5 points (women) a blood&#xD;
      sample will be collected and analyzed for relevant biomarkers. They will be further evaluated&#xD;
      using Prediction of Alcohol Withdrawal Severity Scale (PAWSS). Patients at risk of developing&#xD;
      delirium tremens will be treated according to Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment&#xD;
      (CIWA-Ar) procedures, and referred to specialized alcohol addiction treatment. Patients in&#xD;
      the case group that has prescription(s) for psychoactive medicinal drugs will also be&#xD;
      routinely evaluated by pharmacological assessment of drug concentration in serum samples. If&#xD;
      there is a discrepancy between prescribed dose and serum concentration, or medicinal drugs&#xD;
      other than those being prescribed are found, the patient will be advised to use medicines&#xD;
      according to prescription or have their prescribed dosage altered. If necessary, the patient&#xD;
      will be referred to specialized drug addiction treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be recruited from 3 hospitals: Oslo University Hospital, Lovisenberg&#xD;
      Diakonale Hospital (Oslo) and St Olav Hospital (Trondheim). The recruitment period will be&#xD;
      approximately 4 months for the control group and 4 months for the case group, and estimations&#xD;
      based on previous admission numbers for the 3 hospitals results in about 2500 patients in&#xD;
      each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the study, research personnel will approach the eligible patients once they have been&#xD;
      admitted to various medical wards. The personnel will give the patients written and verbal&#xD;
      information about the study, and the patients who agree to be part of the study will sign a&#xD;
      written consent. Baseline data will be recorded for all patients included in the control and&#xD;
      case groups. These data include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alcohol use past 12 months, Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT-4)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alcohol use last 24 hours,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stages-of-change questionnaire on alcohol, psychoactive medicinal and/or illicit drug&#xD;
           use past 12 months,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-prescribed use of psychoactive medicinal drugs past 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Drug Use Disorder Identification Test (DUDIT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stages-of-change questionnaire on psychoactive medicinal drugs or illicit drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Symptoms Checklist (SCL-5)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Left-over blood samples used for routine diagnostic testing will be collected and&#xD;
           analyzed for ethanol, phosphatidylethanol (PEth; biomarker for alcohol use last 3&#xD;
           weeks), diazepam, N-desmethyldiazepam, clonazepam, oxazepam, nitrazepam, alprazolam,&#xD;
           zopiclone, zolpidem, morphine, codeine, oxycodone, buprenorphine, methadone, tramadol,&#xD;
           amphetamine, methamphetamine, ecstasy (MDMA), THC, cocaine and benzoylecgonine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients in the case group will be invited to submit a new blood sample for PEth&#xD;
           analysis 2 months after inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After 12 months, baseline data will be coupled to the following data from the patient&#xD;
           journal: date and time of admission, days and hours spent at bed-post and intensive&#xD;
           care, number of previous hospital admissions, ICD-10 diagnoses at discharge, level of&#xD;
           care, AUDIT-C score, ethanol and PEth concentration in blood, psychoactive medicine&#xD;
           concentration in serum, CIWA-Ar, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, first triage at&#xD;
           hospital, medicinal curve at admission, marital status, employment status, care status&#xD;
           for children under 18 years of age. Data will also be coupled to various registry data;&#xD;
           The Norwegian Patient Registry: number of admissions in the specialist health care&#xD;
           service 5 years prior to admission, number of treatments with main diagnosis from ICD-10&#xD;
           the within 5 years prior to admission, number of admissions to interdisciplinary&#xD;
           specialist treatment within 5 years after admission, number of admissions within 5 years&#xD;
           after admission; The Social Security Database: performance status at time of admission&#xD;
           and 1 year after; The Norway Control and Payment of Health Reimbursement (KUHR) Database&#xD;
           and the Norwegian Registry for Primary Health Care: patients use of institutions and&#xD;
           other primary health care services such as home nursing and nursing homes 5 years prior&#xD;
           to and 5 years after admission, overview of drug use diagnoses; the Norwegian&#xD;
           Prescription Registry: medication prescribed 5 years prior to and 5 years after&#xD;
           admission; and the Cause of Death Registry: cause of death within 5 years after&#xD;
           admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The database from baseline (questionnaires and blood sample analysis), patient journal data&#xD;
      and the various registry data collected from each included patient will be treated&#xD;
      de-identified. The questionnaires will be in an online-format (&quot;Nettskjema&quot;), and the data&#xD;
      will be submitted directly in a secure database provided by the University of Oslo, called&#xD;
      Services for Sensitive Data (short form &quot;TSD&quot; in Norwegian).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the final database, missing values in variables will result in exclusion of that patient&#xD;
      in statistical analysis (when the variable with missing value is part of a specific&#xD;
      analysis). Statistical analyses will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the alcohol intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To control for baseline measures, multiple models for repeated measures will be used to&#xD;
           evaluate anticipated differences between the intervention and the control groups. For&#xD;
           the continuous outcomes (number of admissions and GP visits) linear mixed models will be&#xD;
           fitted, for binary outcomes models with log link or Poisson link function will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the psychoactive medicinal drug intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multiple mixed effects models for repeated measures will be fitted. The three different&#xD;
           institutions will be entered as random effects, while selected covariates as patients'&#xD;
           age and gender will be modeled as fixed effects. Continuous outcomes (serum&#xD;
           concentrations) will be analyzed using linear mixed models, while changes in&#xD;
           prescriptions with the outcome being binary will be modeled using mixed models with log&#xD;
           or Poission link function. The results will be expressed as effect sizes (for linear&#xD;
           models) or relative risks (RR) for models of binary outcomes.&#xD;
