    <textblock>
      Prospective, randomized control trial To determine if oral caffeine decreases the frequency&#xD;
      of opioid demand in children with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis after their spinal fusion&#xD;
      surgery To compare pain scale ratings, number of requests for diazepam, average heart rate,&#xD;
      average blood pressure, sex, age, ethnicity, post-op day of discharge, operative time,&#xD;
      estimated intraoperative blood loss, remittance post-surgery, length of hospital stay, and&#xD;
      segments fused during spinal fusion surgery.&#xD;

      Because these receptors are so important for modifying pain and inflammation, caffeine has&#xD;
      been added as an adjuvant to common analgesics, such as paracetamol, ibuprofen, and aspirin&#xD;
      in the belief that it will enhance their analgesic efficacy. Most studies used paracetamol or&#xD;
      ibuprofen with 100 mg to 130 mg caffeine, and the most common pain conditions studied were&#xD;
      postoperative dental pain, postpartum pain, and headache. There was a small but statistically&#xD;
      significant benefit with caffeine used at doses of 100 mg or more, which was not dependent on&#xD;
      the pain condition or type of analgesic. Additionally, trials have shown superior efficacy of&#xD;
      adding caffeine to ibuprofen instead of administering ibuprofen alone for treating acute&#xD;
      pain, reflecting that caffeine is an effective analgesic adjuvant. The addition of caffeine&#xD;
      (≥ 100 mg) to a standard dose of commonly used analgesics provides a small but important&#xD;
      increase in the proportion of participants who experience a good level of pain relief.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the beneficial effects of caffeine on aerobic activity and resistance training&#xD;
      performance are well documented. Studies have shown that caffeine ingestion resulted in&#xD;
      significantly lower levels of soreness compared with placebo (p ≤ 0.05). A further beneficial&#xD;
      effect of sustained caffeine ingestion in the days after the exercise bout is an attenuation&#xD;
      of delayed onset muscle soreness. Orthopaedic surgery also causes muscle injury, and patients&#xD;
      might benefit from caffeine's effect on lowering muscle soreness. Acute caffeine&#xD;
      administration also has been shown to demonstrate increases in alertness, contentment,&#xD;
      motivation to work, talkativeness, and energy. It also decreases muscle twitches. All of&#xD;
      these effects would be beneficial in the post-operative period, especially for Adolescence&#xD;
      Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) patients undergoing spinal fusion surgery in the orthopaedic&#xD;
      department at Children's Mercy Hospital.&#xD;
