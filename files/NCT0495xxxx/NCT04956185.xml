  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective observational study is to create a database in which data&#xD;
      will be collected from every patient admitted to the Stroke unit and who has explicitly given&#xD;
      his or her informed consent for this data collection. The data that will be collected are&#xD;
      part of the standard clinical data. No additional investigations, blood tests or any other&#xD;
      tests will be performed. The purpose of this database is to conduct retrospective&#xD;
      observational research in the future and will allow the hospital to keep track of some&#xD;
      important quality indicators in stroke care.&#xD;

      Every patient that is admitted to the Stroke unit will be asked if his or her data and&#xD;
      relevant personal information can be registered in a database with the purpose of conducting&#xD;
      research in the future. If he or she agrees, one of the researchers will go through the&#xD;
      Informed Consent Form together with the patient. If the patient has questions, the researcher&#xD;
      will answer them. If the patient then agrees to the data collection, he or she will sign the&#xD;
      Informed Consent Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data that will be collected are part of the standard clinical data. No additional&#xD;
      investigations, blood tests or any other tests will be performed. We will collect the&#xD;
      following data:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographical information: gender, year of birth&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Relevant medical history: vascular risk profile, neurological history, psychiatric&#xD;
           history, pre-stroke modified Rankin Score (mRS), home medication&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neurological evaluation upon admission to Emergency Department: vital parameters,&#xD;
           clinical neurological evaluation, results imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data concerning acute stroke therapy: intravenous thrombolysis, intra-arterial&#xD;
           thrombectomy, medication started at the Emergency Department, neurosurgical procedures&#xD;
           if performed, (neurological) evaluation after treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Course of hospitalisation: complications (neurological deterioration, epilepsy,&#xD;
           infections, falls, speech or swallow disturbances, thrombo-embolic complications, pain,&#xD;
           cardiac complications), start of medication, treatment (such as physiotherapy,&#xD;
           occupational therapy), date of discharge, mRS and NIHSS score at discharge, care after&#xD;
           discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Results stroke-investigations: imaging of brain and neck vessels, telemetry, Holter&#xD;
           monitoring, transthoracic and/or transesophageal ultrasound, blood workup,&#xD;
           electro-encephalographic investigations, genetic workup, etiology of stroke&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Therapy at discharge: medication, revalidation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  mRS score during follow-up at policlinic neurology&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this database is to conduct retrospective observational research in the future&#xD;
      and will allow the hospital to keep track of some important quality indicators in stroke&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
