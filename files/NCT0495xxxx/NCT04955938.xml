  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to gather information on the safety and effectiveness of&#xD;
      fedratinib (a drug called a &quot;jak inhibitor&quot; ) in combination with ivosidenib or enasidenib&#xD;
      (two anti-cancer drugs). While all three drugs are FDA-approved for various conditions, the&#xD;
      US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved the combination of these drugs for the&#xD;
      treatment of rare blood cancers that present Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations, and&#xD;
      therefore these drugs can only be given in a research study.&#xD;

      Doctors leading this study hope to learn about the safety of combining fedratinib (a type of&#xD;
      drug called a &quot;JAK inhibitor&quot; whichblocks the activity of janus kinase enzymes in your body)&#xD;
      with anti-cancer drugs ivosidenib and enasidenib in participants who have rare blood cancers&#xD;
      that show Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations (a type of genetic mutation). Your&#xD;
      participation in this research will last about 24 months.&#xD;

             steroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the&#xD;
             use of fedratinib in combination with IDH inhibitors in patients &lt;18 years of age,&#xD;
             children are excluded from this study, but will be eligible for future pediatric&#xD;
             trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ≤2 (see Appendix A).&#xD;

             have completed therapy and are free of disease for ≥ 3 years or they are not currently&#xD;
             requiring treatment for an indolent malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with prior history of encephalopathy, including Wernicke's (WE). If a patient&#xD;
             has signs/symptoms of encephalopathy, including WE (eg severe ataxia, ocular paralysis&#xD;
             or cerebellar signs) in which case thiamine deficiency needs to be excluded and a&#xD;
             brain MRI might be required to exclude possible Wernicke's encephalopathy. Patients&#xD;
             with thiamine deficiency that has not been corrected before proceeding to the dose&#xD;
             finding phase of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to fedratinib, ivosidenib, or enasidenib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving any medications or substances that are inhibitors or inducers of&#xD;
             CYP3A4 should have eligibility and alternative medications reviewed by site PI.&#xD;
             Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to&#xD;
             regularly consult a frequently-updated list such as&#xD;
             http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx; medical reference texts such as&#xD;
             the Physicians' Desk Reference may also provide this information. As part of the&#xD;
             enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of&#xD;
             interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be&#xD;
             prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal&#xD;
             product.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, active chronic liver disease (eg chronic alcoholic liver disease,&#xD;
             autoimmune hepatitis, sclerosing cholangitis, primary biliary cholangitis,&#xD;
             hemochromatosis) or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance&#xD;
             with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has a history of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has QTc interval (ie, Fridericia's correction [QTcF]) ≥ 450 msec or other&#xD;
             factors that increase the risk of QT prolongation or arrhythmic events (e.g. family&#xD;
             history of long QT interval syndrome) at screening unless due to bundle branch block&#xD;
             or pacemaker with approval of the principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because fedratinib, ivosidenib, and&#xD;
             enasidenib carry the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there&#xD;
             is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with fedratinib, ivosidenib, and enasidenib, breastfeeding&#xD;
             should be discontinued if the mother is treated with any of these agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients, patients with active hepatitis B, and patients with active&#xD;
             Hepatitis C on antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for&#xD;
             pharmacokinetic interactions with fedratinib, ivosidenib, and enasidenib. In addition,&#xD;
             these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with&#xD;
             marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients&#xD;
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is known to have dysphagia, short-gut syndrome, gastroparesis, or other&#xD;
             conditions that limit the ingestion or gastrointestinal absorption of drugs&#xD;
             administered orally.&#xD;
