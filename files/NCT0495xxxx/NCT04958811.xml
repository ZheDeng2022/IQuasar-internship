&#xD;
               -  Women must remain abstinent or use contraceptive methods with a failure rate of &lt;&#xD;
                  1% per year during the treatment period and for 6 months after the final dose of&#xD;
                  study treatment. Women must refrain from donating eggs during this same period.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarchal,&#xD;
                  has not reached a postmenopausal state (≥ 12 continuous months of amenorrhea with&#xD;
                  no identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone surgical&#xD;
                  sterilization (removal of ovaries and/or uterus). The definition of childbearing&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year include&#xD;

                  duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the&#xD;
                  patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or&#xD;
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not adequate methods of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For men: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use&#xD;
             contraceptive measures, and agreement to refrain from donating sperm, as defined&#xD;
             below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  With a female partner of childbearing potential who is not pregnant, men who are&#xD;
                  not surgically sterile must remain abstinent or use a condom plus an additional&#xD;
                  contraceptive method that together result in a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year&#xD;
                  during the treatment period and for 6 months after the final dose of bevacizumab&#xD;
                  and 90 days after the final dose of tiragolumab. Men must refrain from donating&#xD;
                  sperm during this this same period.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  With a pregnant female partner, men must remain abstinent or use a condom during&#xD;
                  the treatment period and for 6 months after the final dose of bevacizumab and 90&#xD;
                  days after the final dose of tiragolumab to avoid potential exposure to the&#xD;
                  embryo.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the&#xD;
                  duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the&#xD;
                  patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or&#xD;
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not adequate methods of contraception.&#xD;
