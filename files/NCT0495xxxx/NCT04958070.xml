  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MPS I newborn screening has been executed in Taiwan nationwide since August 2015. Infants who&#xD;
      failed the recheck at recall were referred to MacKay Memorial Hospital for a detailed&#xD;
      confirmatory diagnosis. Urinary first-line biochemistry examinations including urinary GAG&#xD;
      quantification (DMB/Cre. ratio), two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-D EP), and tandem mass&#xD;
      spectrometry assay for predominant disaccharides derived from GAGs (i.e. CS, DS, HS, and KS)&#xD;
      were performed. If the results were positive, a confirmative diagnosis was made according to&#xD;
      the results of leukocyte enzymatic assay and molecular DNA analysis. Up to January 31, 2019,&#xD;
      a total of 390,793 infants had been analyzed for MPS I, in those 11 suspicious cases were&#xD;
      referred to MacKay Memorial Hospital for confirmation. The recall rates of MPS I was 0.0028%.&#xD;
      Four of the 11 infants were confirmed to have MPS I. The prevalence rates of MPS I was 1.02&#xD;
      per 100,000 live births, respectively. Infants suspected of having MPS with a positive&#xD;
      laboratory diagnosis but without any typical, clinical manifestations are not conformed to&#xD;
      receive ERT under the treatment guideline of ERT for MPS in Taiwan. Distinctly, the clinical&#xD;
      manifestations of MPS are irreversible and would be worse progressively while the symptoms&#xD;
      have shown up. Receiving ERT at this time would effectively prevent the progression of&#xD;
      illness, but, cannot rescue or reform the irreversible physical problems. By proceeding and&#xD;
      undergoing an intensively long-term regular physical and laboratory examinations for&#xD;
      asymptomatic infants with MPS I can effectively control the possibility of giving an ERT in a&#xD;
      timely fashion.&#xD;

      The study hypothesis is to proceed and to undergo an intensively long-term clinical&#xD;
      management and laboratory examinations for asymptomatic infants with MPS I in order to be&#xD;
      able to give an enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in a timely fashion. The overall objectives&#xD;
      of this study are summarized as follows, including: 1. To plan a three-month or six-month&#xD;
      interval of recall process depending on the judgment of individual case by pediatric&#xD;
      geneticist. 2. To recall the asymptomatic MPS I infants back to MacKay Memorial Hospital for&#xD;
      MPS follow-up examinations, including regular physical examinations for the earliest&#xD;
      presenting symptoms such as otitis media, abdominal or inguinal hernia, and coarse facial&#xD;
      features, as well as the urinary biochemistry glycosaminoglycan (GAG) tests. 3. To give ERT&#xD;
      in time whenever the typical MPS signs or symptoms showed up. 4. To achieve the aim of&#xD;
      newborn screening for MPS, &quot;Early detection, making early diagnosis, and providing early&#xD;
      therapy can effectively prevent the development of severe clinical manifestations&quot;.&#xD;

        The confirmed MPS I infants would be the major objects in this study for long-term&#xD;
        inspections and assessments. In addition to this, some referral cases would be included in&#xD;
        this study if the case is with negative GAG tests, but having been identified with two&#xD;
        nucleotide variations or with significant reduction of IDUA enzyme activity. The estimated&#xD;
        subject population would be 12 (11+1) in the first year, 16 (12+4) in the second year, and&#xD;
        20 (16+4) in the third year according to the recall rate of MPS I and the realistic&#xD;
        situation of referred cases from newborn screening centers to MacKay Memorial Hospital.&#xD;
