  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fatigue is found to be one of the most persistent problems among patients in treatment with&#xD;
      hemodialysis, and associated with impaired health-related quality of life. A few,&#xD;
      non-randomized controlled trials have found positive effects on fatigue by offering&#xD;
      pre-recorded music intra-dialytic, however, without conclusive results. So far, no studies&#xD;
      have investigated the feasibility of integrating person-tailored live music interventions&#xD;
      performed by professional musicians into a hemodialysis setting. This leaves a deficit in&#xD;
      knowledge for intervention planning, understanding and effectiveness of live music on&#xD;
      fatigue, wellbeing and feelings of meaningfulness in this group of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A pilot randomized controlled trial combined with qualitative methods. The data&#xD;
      collection will involve recruitment of 24 patients from an outpatient clinic over a six-week&#xD;
      period. The patients will be randomized into either an intervention group or a control group.&#xD;
      Patients in the intervention group will be offered a 30-minute session of patient-tailored&#xD;
      live music intervention per week for six consecutive weeks. Patients in the control group&#xD;
      will receive standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative analysis on immediate post-dialysis fatigue (VAS), and long-term fatigue&#xD;
      (MFI-20), anxiety, depression (HADS) and treatment satisfaction (VAS) will show the potential&#xD;
      effectiveness of intervention. Qualitative analysis of informal-interviews (patients/staff),&#xD;
      observational data (patients) and focus group interviews (staff/musicians) will explore an&#xD;
      in-depth understanding of whether music will improve wellbeing and create feelings of&#xD;
      meaningfulness among this group of patients as well as to assess feasibility acceptability&#xD;
      among patients, musicians and staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives: This trial will ensure a firm methodological approach for the development of a&#xD;
      future definitive randomized controlled trial of music intervention for fatigue reduction and&#xD;
      wellbeing among hemodialysis patients.&#xD;
