      Robotic Assisted Evacuation of Sub-acute and Chronic Hypertensive Cerebral Hemorrhage for&#xD;
      Accelerating Functional Rehabilitation: a Multi-center Clinical Trial&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      1. Research background: The existing literature is controversial about the surgical&#xD;
           treatment of hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage, especially for the hemorrhage that&#xD;
           is less than or equal to 30ml in the deep functional area of the brain. Many large-scale&#xD;
           clinical studies have not shown surgery (open surgery). , Minimally invasive puncture&#xD;
           and hemolysis). The patient's prognosis (survival rate, functional recovery) was not&#xD;
           significantly different from conservative treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. There are shortcomings in previous studies: the intervention time, intervention methods&#xD;
           are complicated, there are many confounding factors, and the multimodal evaluation data&#xD;
           are lacking. Therefore, the research results are coarse and lacking in credibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The general opinion of the surgeon: Early removal of hematoma can help reduce&#xD;
           intracranial hypertension and reduce the compression of functional fiber conduction&#xD;
           bundles. In theory, there is a benefit. However, surgery may also have the risk of&#xD;
           iatrogenic destruction of functional fiber bundles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Our design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Exclude patients in the acute phase (hematoma progressively enlarged and impaired&#xD;
      consciousness). These patients should undergo surgery immediately. However, the personal&#xD;
      judgment of the first-visiting doctors (Shenin and Shenwai) has a great influence, and early&#xD;
      treatment may not be timely. The long-term prognosis has caused bias in the study. At the&#xD;
      same time, due to the rapid course of the disease, the relevant assessment cannot be improved&#xD;
      in the early stage, resulting in missing data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2) For patients who choose early conservative treatment, after the hematoma enters the&#xD;
      subacute stage, complete the relevant imaging examinations, exclude vascular malformations,&#xD;
      and clarify the relationship between blood clots and important white matter fiber bundles,&#xD;
      and perform robotic minimally invasive aspiration. On the one hand, it reduces the pressure&#xD;
      of hematoma on the peripheral functional fiber bundles, while minimizing iatrogenic damage;&#xD;
      on the other hand, it reduces the killing of peripheral nerve cells by the deposition of&#xD;
      hemosiderin after the disintegration of red blood cells.&#xD;
