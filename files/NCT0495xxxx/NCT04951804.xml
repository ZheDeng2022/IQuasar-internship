    <textblock>
      Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) allows EUS-guided trans gastric injection of absolute alcohol&#xD;
      around the base of the celiac plexus (celiac plexus neurolysis (EUS-CPN)), to help alleviate&#xD;
      pain associated with pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is standard procedure to inject bupivacaine immediately before injecting absolute alcohol,&#xD;
      to theoretically prevent pain that may occur during and after the procedure. However, there&#xD;
      are no data showing whether bupivacaine injection has any real influence on intra-procedural,&#xD;
      immediate post-procedural, or long-term pain control. The injection of bupivacaine before the&#xD;
      alcohol may have no effect, a synergistic effect, or an antagonistic effect, by diluting the&#xD;
      alcohol, and reducing its neurolytic capacity. Inadvertent intravascular injection of&#xD;
      bupivacaine may also cause irreversible cardiac arrhythmias and death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators therefore propose a randomized clinical trial to determine whether the&#xD;
      exclusion of bupivacaine during EUS-guided CPN improves outcomes, or not.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic malignancies are the second most frequent gastrointestinal malignancy in Canada.&#xD;
      From cancer mortality statistics in 2014, there were 4,700 new cases of pancreatic&#xD;
      malignancies second only to colorectal cancer, representing 2.4% of all cancers. Even with&#xD;
      chemotherapy, the median survival for patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma is 6 to 10&#xD;
      months. Few patients are diagnosed at a resectable stage (12%-20%) so many patients are&#xD;
      candidates for palliation only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, one of the most important symptoms is pain because it often affects both&#xD;
      quality of life and survival. 70 to 80 % of patients with pancreatic cancer have abdominal&#xD;
      pain at the time of diagnosis. Adequate pain control is therefore an essential component of&#xD;
      care in these patients. In the initial phase, the pain is visceral, but with disease&#xD;
      progression, somatic pain may occur, especially due to the peri-pancreatic invasion of neural&#xD;
      structures, such as the celiac plexus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard analgesics such as acetaminophen are usually ineffective and the use and&#xD;
      effectiveness of opioids is frequently limited by side effects such as nausea, constipation,&#xD;
      somnolence, confusion or respiratory depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The celiac plexus is immediately adjacent to the gastric wall. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)&#xD;
      allows EUS-guided trans gastric injection of neurolytic agents around the celiac plexus&#xD;
      (celiac plexus neurolysis [CPN]). Under conscious sedation, the echoendoscope is advanced&#xD;
      into the stomach, just distal to the gastro-esophageal junction. The region of the celiac&#xD;
      plexus is identified around the takeoff of the celiac artery from the aorta. Then, under&#xD;
      real-time ultrasound guidance, a 19g needle is used to inject a neurolytic agent such as&#xD;
      absolute alcohol around the base of the celiac artery. The entire procedure takes&#xD;
      approximately 5 minutes. Absolute alcohol causes the immediate destruction of the celiac&#xD;
      plexus neurons, by precipitation of endoneural lipoproteins and mucoproteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness of CPN, is well established. It is safe, produces significant pain&#xD;
      reduction, significantly reduces narcotic requirements, and may even increase survival. The&#xD;
      investigators were the first to publish a randomized, sham-controlled trial demonstrating the&#xD;
      efficacy of EUS-CPN for pain due to pancreatic cancer, and authored the most recent published&#xD;
      guidelines on the use of EUS-CPN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on our experience in over 1000 neurolysis procedures, patients undergoing EUS-guided&#xD;
      CPN may experience pain, acutely during alcohol injection, and sometimes post-procedure, for&#xD;
      up to a few hours. (Unpublished observations) It is possible that the presence of pain during&#xD;
      injection of alcohol indicates that the celiac plexus has been accurately targeted and may&#xD;
      therefore portend better long-term pain control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, during the neurolysis procedure, it is standard procedure to inject bupivacaine&#xD;
      immediately before injecting absolute alcohol, to theoretically prevent pain during and after&#xD;
      the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The true value of bupivacaine during neurolysis has never been studied. There are no data&#xD;
      showing whether bupivacaine injection has any real influence on intra-procedural, immediate&#xD;
      post-procedural, or long-term pain control. The injection of bupivacaine before the alcohol&#xD;
      may have no effect, a synergistic effect, or an antagonistic effect, by diluting the alcohol,&#xD;
      and reducing its neurolytic capacity. Inadvertent intravascular injection of bupivacaine may&#xD;
      also cause irreversible cardiac arrhythmias and death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In other words, in the worst case scenario, the injection of bupivacaine may increase&#xD;
      procedural risk, without any associated benefit in terms of pain reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EUS team at the CHUM stopped using bupivacaine during neurolysis approximately 2 years&#xD;
      ago and has noticed no obvious difference in pain during the procedure or in the immediate&#xD;
      post-procedure recovery period, no increase in complications, and a possible reduction in&#xD;
      requests for repeat neurolysis - suggesting that neurolysis without bupivacaine may be more&#xD;
      effective. (Unpublished observations)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators therefore propose a randomized clinical trial to determine whether the&#xD;
      exclusion of bupivacaine during EUS-guided CPN improves outcomes, or not.&#xD;
