      The study will include healthy volunteers aged 12-17 years inclusive. Volunteers will be&#xD;
      recruited in at least two clinical centers. Teams will be divided into subgroups to ensure&#xD;
      the safety of volunteers during hospitalization amid the ongoing pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1 (Phase I-II) - 100 volunteers will be included in two dosing groups (50 in each&#xD;
      group), a sufficient number of volunteers should be screened (no more than 7 days before&#xD;
      inclusion in the study). To ensure the required number of volunteers who have completed&#xD;
      screening procedures (pre-screening procedures can be organized).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The conditions of the study were the selection of doses (administration of the drug and&#xD;
      observation for 48 hours) in a hospital setting, the rest of the visits were outpatient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is planned to start the study with a dose of 1/10 of the full adult dose. Volunteers will&#xD;
      be hospitalized the day before vaccination. It is allowed to carry out screening procedures&#xD;
      the day before vaccination in a hospital setting, subject to the prior approval of the&#xD;
      volunteer based on the results of pre-screening. The first dose will be administered on day&#xD;
      1. After that, the volunteer will be monitored in the hospital for 48 hours. on days 3 and 7,&#xD;
      a telephone consultation will be held. With a favorable safety profile after 7 days after the&#xD;
      1/10 dose, the Principal Investigators present a consolidated decision to escalate the dose&#xD;
      to 1/5 of the adult dose on ICMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The transition to the next stage is planned on the basis of the report on the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of ILS on the 28th day after the introduction of the first component. The&#xD;
      selected dose will be determined based on the immunogenicity scores at day 28, which should&#xD;
      be consistent with the immunogenicity in adults after receiving the full dose of ILP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2 (Phase III) - 3000 volunteers to be randomized to two groups - active drug and&#xD;
      placebo in a ratio of 4: 1. Volunteers will receive the drug at the dose selected in the&#xD;
      first phase. Research is carried out on an outpatient basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomization of research subjects will be carried out in two age strata: 12-14 years old&#xD;
      and 15-17 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intramuscular vaccine will be administered at vaccination visits # 2 and # 3 (Day 1 and&#xD;
      Day 21 ± 2) on an outpatient basis. After vaccination, TMK will be carried out for 2 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visits # 4 (28 ± 2), 5 (42 ± 4), 6 (90 ± 7) and 7 (180 ± 14); TMK for 270 ± 14 and&#xD;
      365 ± 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally historical control data will be used (data from phase III clinical trials of&#xD;
      efficacy, safety and immunogenicity obtained during their evaluation in a sample of adult&#xD;
      volunteers aged 18-21 years);&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of study participation for one subject will be 365 ± 14 days after the first&#xD;
      dose of vaccine, during which each subject will undergo a screening visit, two&#xD;
      hospitalizations for drug administration, five face-to-face visits to the investigator, and&#xD;
      telephone contacts with the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data of research subjects will be collected using electronic forms of individual&#xD;
      registration cards, as well as using electronic questionnaires (diaries) filled in by&#xD;
      research subjects.&#xD;
