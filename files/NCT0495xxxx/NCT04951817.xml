      It is a open-label single-arm clinical trial. Outcome measurement is the positivity rate of&#xD;
      Ga68-PSMA-11 PET-defined progression and Bone Scan-defined progression. The primary objective&#xD;
      is to compare the diagnostic positivity in progression of PSMA PET and BS. The 2×2&#xD;
      contingency table with four diagnostic outcomes (both positive, PET positive/BS negative, PET&#xD;
      negative/BS positive, and both negative) will be conducted based on the enrolled subjects.&#xD;
      Both diagnostic tools (Ga68-PSMA-11 PET and BS) are applied to a given set of individuals.&#xD;
      Since both diagnostic tools will performed on each subject, then paired data result and&#xD;
      methods that account for the correlated binary outcomes are necessary. McNemar's test will be&#xD;
      used to compare the positivity of the two tools. Assuming that Ga68-PSMA-11 PET in patients&#xD;
      detect more metastatic lesions/progression by 26.5% (i.e. p10-p01=0.265) and the discordant&#xD;
      percentage is 38.5 % (i.e. p10+p01=0.385). Under the hypothesis H0: p10=p01, achieving an 80%&#xD;
      power at the 5% of significance level, the sample size is 44. Based on expecting 15% of&#xD;
      missing rate, the adjusted sample size will be 52. This calculation was done by PASS software&#xD;
      (Power Analysis and Sample Size version 11.0.8, NCSS, Kaysville, Utah, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For PET/CT PSMA scan, the subject will have catheter(s) placed for intravenous administration&#xD;
      of [68Ga]PSMA-11. Subjects will receive a single intravenous bolus of 2-5 mCi [68Ga]PSMA-11&#xD;
      and received PET/CT scan 60 minutes later. PSMA PET-CT scan was performed on a GE Discovery&#xD;
      MI PET/CT system. The CT scan parameters were 120 kVp, 30 mA to 300 mA acquired with auto mA&#xD;
      , 40× 0.625 collimator configuration, and pitch of 0.984 : 1. All images were reconstructed&#xD;
      with a 500 mm field of view and a slice thickness of 5 mm. The PET acquisition time was 3&#xD;
      mins per bed position with maximum overlap (35 slices). Images were reconstructed using Q&#xD;
      clear with beta value of 550, PSF correction, and non-TOF (QCHD-S). The matrix is 256 × 256.&#xD;
      After image acquisition, the subject will be observed for half an hour, and will be&#xD;
      discharged if no adverse event happens. EKG, blood and biochemistry test will be performed&#xD;
      before and after first PET scan no more than two weeks. Except baseline Ga68-PSMA-11 PET/CT&#xD;
      scan, patients will receive serial PET scans after 3rd injection of Ra-233 and 6th injection&#xD;
      of Ra-223. All of the images were interpreted by an experienced nuclear medicine physicians.&#xD;
