    <measure>the difference of the specific Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms(SNPs)</measure>
    <time_frame>2021.1.6--2021.12.31</time_frame>
    <description>We will test the specific SNPs that we have selected before, such as rs670, rs671, rs1014290 and so on. The SNPs will be tested by Taqman SNP assay and verified by sequencing.</description>

    <measure>intestinal flora</measure>
    <time_frame>2021.1.6--2022.12.31</time_frame>
    <description>Feces will be collected in gout, hyperuricemia patients and healthy subjects. ofIntestinal flora will be tested and analysed. The detailed measurement is as follows: Firstly, the DNA of feces will be extracted according to the protocol of Fecal DNA Extraction Kit. Then, the concentration and purity of fecal DNA will be tested by spectrophotometer. Sequencing of the V3-V4 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene, building a library and then sequencing the qualified libraries by Illumina Platform(MiSeq). Using the QIIME、UCLUST、SILVA and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes(KEGG) database to comparison and screen the intestinal bacterial with statistical significance. Operational taxonomic unit (OTU), α-diversity, β-diversity indices and so on of the fecal microbiota will be analyzed in patients with gout and hyperuricemia and normal control.</description>
