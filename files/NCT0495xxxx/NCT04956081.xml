      Phase I study of a virtual neuro-navigation package with built-in support for identifying&#xD;
      specific &quot;surface-based&quot; targets to optimze TMS treatment.&#xD;

      Background: Personalized MR neuro-navigation-based targeting approaches have been developed&#xD;
      that have the potential to greatly increase TMS efficacy. Nevertheless, these have yet to be&#xD;
      incorporated into routine clinical practice because of issues related to 1) the feasibility&#xD;
      of neuro-navigation when applied to routine clinical practice, and 2) lack of biomarker-based&#xD;
      validation of the critical target across individuals. Recent research at CU has begun to&#xD;
      address both feasibility and targeting issues. In the MR-guided neuro-navigation approach,&#xD;
      either structural or functional brain scans are used to identify a specific region of&#xD;
      interest and the neuro-navigation system is then used to position the TMS coil to target that&#xD;
      specific region across individuals. While this approach can be applied within specialized&#xD;
      treatment settings, use of these devices requires expertise in 3D brain reconstruction that&#xD;
      the majority of TMS providers do not possess. At CU, an initiative is underway to develop a&#xD;
      &quot;virtual neuro-navigation&quot; system in which MRI images of the head and brain are uploaded into&#xD;
      a server and neuro-navigation is performed &quot;in silico&quot; rather than in person. Scalp&#xD;
      coordinates are then relayed to the clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study: Under this phase I study, Soterix Medical would develop an initial version of the&#xD;
      software (&quot;TMSMap&quot;) and CU would perform feasibility testing on patients with treatment&#xD;
      resistant depression&#xD;
