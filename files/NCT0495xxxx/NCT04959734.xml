  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bronchiolitis is a very common winter disease that normally affects children less than one&#xD;
      year of age. It is a common reason for parents and carers to bring their child to an&#xD;
      Emergency Department (ED) and the frequent need for hospital admission means that paediatric&#xD;
      units are at their capacity each winter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the COVID19 pandemic the virus that causes bronchiolitis (Respiratory Syncytial Virus;&#xD;
      RSV) disappeared meaning this winter there have been virtually no cases of bronchiolitis in&#xD;
      the United Kingdom. This phenomenon has been observed in many other countries around the&#xD;
      world. Evidence from Australia suggests as restrictions such as social distancing for COVID19&#xD;
      are relaxed bronchiolitis returns, even in the summer. At the release of lockdown the return&#xD;
      has been so dramatic in some areas of Australia the summer time numbers are above a typical&#xD;
      winter. There is also evidence it may affect older children up to 2 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is likely the Australian experience will be mirrored in the UK. The ability to track,&#xD;
      anticipate and respond to a surge in bronchiolitis is important. There is a need to&#xD;
      understand:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the onset of RSV spread at the earliest opportunity. This is important as some children&#xD;
           are at higher risk of hospitalisation, intensive care admission or death if they&#xD;
           contract RSV; knowing when to passively immunise these children is a public health&#xD;
           priority.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. whether the population at risk is a wider age range than normal and whether disease&#xD;
           severity is greater as these will both effect service planning;&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are currently no existing studies or surveillance systems fully able to address these&#xD;
      questions. This study will use staff in Emergency Department to report, in real time, case of&#xD;
      bronchiolitis that they see and record essential, but non-identifying, information about&#xD;
      them.&#xD;
