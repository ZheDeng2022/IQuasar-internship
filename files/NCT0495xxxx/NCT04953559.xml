    <textblock>
      Insomnia is generally believed to be caused by excessive arousal of the brain and body.&#xD;
      Rather than transitioning normally and quickly from wakefulness to sleep, individuals with&#xD;
      insomnia tend to enter into a self-perpetuating cycle of self-referential thought and&#xD;
      arousal. Brain imaging research has shown that these same internally focused self-reflective&#xD;
      thoughts tend to activate a core system in the brain known as the Default Mode Network (DMN).&#xD;
      The DMN is usually active when a person is internally focused, such as during daydreaming or&#xD;
      mind wandering, but tends to be deactivated when the brain is focused on the external&#xD;
      environment. The investigators hypothesize that excess activation and connectivity of this&#xD;
      brain network may perpetuate internal conversations, worry, and rumination, preventing&#xD;
      individuals with insomnia from falling asleep quickly and remaining asleep. Therefore, the&#xD;
      goal of the present study is to use a brain stimulation technique known as transcranial&#xD;
      magnetic stimulation (TMS) to target the DMN and slightly reduce its activation before bed.&#xD;
      This should result in an easier time falling asleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, the investigators will recruit 20 healthy individuals and have them sleep in&#xD;
      the lab on two occasions. On one occasion, they will be stimulated with a type of TMS called&#xD;
      continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS), which will be targeted toward their DMN. They will&#xD;
      then try to sleep in the lab while the investigators record their brain waves using a&#xD;
      technique known as polysomnography (PSG). On the other occasion, these same individuals will&#xD;
      undergo the same procedure, but the TMS machine will be in a deactivated mode to present a&#xD;
      &quot;sham&quot; stimulation. Participants will again try to sleep in the lab following the sham&#xD;
      treatment while being recorded with PSG. Neither the participants nor the experimenters will&#xD;
      know which condition the participant is receiving at the time. This will only be revealed&#xD;
      later. Additionally, all participants will receive a brain scan just before and just after&#xD;
      the TMS procedures so that the investigators can examine changes in brain connectivity and&#xD;
      chemistry. The investigators expect that the participants will sleep better following the&#xD;
      cTBS than following the sham condition and that this will be associated with measurable&#xD;
      differences in their brain connectivity and brain chemistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If effective, this project would have identified an innovative and novel approach for&#xD;
      improving sleep without using drugs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with psychophysiological insomnia show greater waking functional connectivity&#xD;
      within the DMN compared to healthy individuals. It has been postulated that excessive&#xD;
      activation and connectivity of the DMN may be associated with ruminative thinking and&#xD;
      internally generated arousal, which makes it difficult to fall asleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective. The overall objective of this proposal is to temporarily alter the&#xD;
      strength of connectivity within the DMN using cTBS before sleep and determine the effects on&#xD;
      subsequent sleep. This project is expected to yield robust preliminary data that would allow&#xD;
      more extensive research, including a larger follow-on clinical trial to determine the&#xD;
      effectiveness of this approach for improving sleep difficulties in military personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this project will be accomplished through the following Specific Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: Determine the effects of cTBS targeted to the DMN on sleep quality, brain&#xD;
      neurochemistry, functional connectivity, and next-day cognitive performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' working hypothesis is that relative to sham treatment, cTBS will suppress&#xD;
      neural activity within the DMN, leading to improvements in polysomnographically (PSG)&#xD;
      measured sleep parameters, and this will be associated with neurochemistry changes and&#xD;
      functional connectivity in the DMN, and will improve next day cognitive performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of this Specific Aim, the expected outcome is to have determined the effects&#xD;
      of cTBS on sleep quality, timing, and duration, and identified the brain systems and&#xD;
      neurochemistry profiles associated with this change. If successful, this would represent&#xD;
      proof-of-concept of a potentially safe non-pharmacologic method to facilitate sleep, and this&#xD;
      information could form the basis for follow-on research to refine and further validate this&#xD;
      technique to potentially optimize sleep under a variety of militarily-relevant situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insomnia is reported as the most common sleep disorder. It can range in severity, but the&#xD;
      most common symptom is difficulty maintaining sleep. Other manifestations of insomnia include&#xD;
      early-morning awakenings, and difficulty falling asleep. According to other research, its&#xD;
      prevalence is 10 to 15% depending on diagnostic criteria. Roughly 50% of people reporting&#xD;
      insomnia have more severe symptoms that meet the criteria for insomnia disorder. Insomnia is&#xD;
      conceptualized as a disorder of nocturnal and daytime hyperarousal. This state of arousal is&#xD;
      both a cause and a consequence of insomnia. Insomnia causes symptoms that effect people on a&#xD;
      cognitive, emotional, and physiological level. People with insomnia often report the feeling&#xD;
      of excessive worrying, racing thoughts, and selective attention. Physiologically, insomnia is&#xD;
      associated with increased whole-body metabolic rate, increased cortisol levels, increased&#xD;
      blood pressure, and elevated brain glucose consumption during both waking and sleeping&#xD;
      states. The stressors of chronic insomnia are also associated with an increased risk of&#xD;
      developing psychological disorders such as depression and anxiety disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A large number of military personnel report significant sleep difficulties or chronic sleep&#xD;
      restriction. In fact, about 42% of military personnel regularly obtain five hours of sleep or&#xD;
      less per night, a level that is insufficient to sustain optimal alertness, vigilance, and&#xD;
      decision-making. It has been reported that up to 85% of military Service members meet the&#xD;
      criteria for a clinically relevant sleep disorder, with approximately 25% having a primary&#xD;
      complaint of insomnia (i.e., difficulty falling or staying asleep). Pharmacologic sleep&#xD;
      medications may be effective in some situations, but may also be contraindicated in&#xD;
      operational environments where alertness is integral. Because sleep problems are among the&#xD;
      top complaints of military personnel and can have profound impacts on force readiness, it is&#xD;
      imperative that novel approaches to minimizing insomnia and sleep problems be developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMS is a brain stimulation technique which poses far fewer safety risks and adverse&#xD;
      experiences than its predecessor, electroconvulsive therapy. TMS has been Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA)-approved and found effective for use in cases of treatment resistant&#xD;
      depression, but has also been utilized off-label to treat OCD and other psychiatric&#xD;
      disorders. TMS has demonstrated superior efficacy in the treatment of primary insomnia than&#xD;
      both typical medication or psychotherapy treatments. In addition, TMS of the right parietal&#xD;
      lobe was shown to be effective for alleviating symptoms of comorbid anxiety and insomnia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In lay terms, TMS works by targeting electromagnetic fields at particular brain areas from&#xD;
      outside of the body. These electromagnetic fields create a current in the brain via the&#xD;
      electrochemical firing of brain cells (neurons). This process can influence the function of&#xD;
      the targeted brain areas by either facilitating or impairing functional connectivity in a&#xD;
      particular network of interconnected brain regions, such as the network associated with&#xD;
      daydreaming and self-referential thought (DMN).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The form of TMS to be utilized in present study, continuous theta burst (cTBS), allows for&#xD;
      the induction of temporary inhibition of cortical activity using a much shorter length of&#xD;
      stimulation as compared to rTMS (repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation). This protocol&#xD;
      was selected for its ability to inhibit, rather than stimulate, activity in the DMN. Prior&#xD;
      research using cTBS has shown that this technique can safely and temporarily impair function&#xD;
      and connectivity in targeted brain areas. Therefore, the investigators hypothesize that a&#xD;
      mild disruption of DMN activation using cTBS prior to sleep will facilitate sleep onset among&#xD;
      individuals meeting criteria for primary insomnia, and the investigators further propose that&#xD;
      this change will be associated with measurable changes in DMN connectivity and&#xD;
      neurochemistry. To test this hypothesis, the investigators will stimulate a node of the DMN&#xD;
      approximately two hours before bedtime using cTBS in order to reduce activation and&#xD;
      connectivity within the stimulated regions.&#xD;
