  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational, multicentre, prospective, post-market product registry for&#xD;
      participants with AF for whom ablation by the commercially available Globe Mapping and&#xD;
      Ablation System was indicated before enrolment into the registry. The aim of the registry is&#xD;
      to confirm the clinical performance and safety of the Globe Mapping and Ablation System in a&#xD;
      real-life setting.&#xD;
