  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to investigate whether hemodynamic status before SBT contributed to the&#xD;
      effect of sodium bicarbonate infusion on the risk of neonatal organ dysfunction and mortality&#xD;
      in critically ill patients with early metabolic acidosis in ICU.&#xD;

      Study Population We obtained data from the MIMIC-III. The newest version of MIMIC-III, v.&#xD;
      1.4, integrates 61,532 patients admitted to the ICUs of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center&#xD;
      in Boston, Massachusetts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study included patients with severe metabolic acidosis within 48 hours after ICU&#xD;
      admission who fulfilled all of the following criteria: (1) pH≤7.3; (2) BE≤-8, or HCO3- &lt; 20&#xD;
      mmol/L if BE was missing; and (3) PaCO2&lt; 50 mmHg, or without chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
      disease (COPD) in discharge diagnoses if PaCO2 was unavailable. The lowest values of pH, BE,&#xD;
      and HCO3- and the highest value of PaCO2 were selected when there were multiple measurements.&#xD;
      We defined a composite of newly &quot;developed or exacerbated organ dysfunction&quot; (d/eOD) as a net&#xD;
      increase in Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score ≥2 of at least one organ within&#xD;
      7 days of ICU admission over the baseline (SOFA score in the first 24 hours). Hemodynamic&#xD;
      status during the initial resuscitation was defined as hemodynamic improvement, hemodynamic&#xD;
      worsening and unchanged hemodynamics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables Characteristic data of patients were extracted, including age and sex; category of&#xD;
      diseases (surgical vs medical), history of comorbidity and whether cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      resuscitation (CPR) was experienced; and diagnosis of sepsis, shock and AKI. Supportive&#xD;
      interventions such as mechanical ventilation (MV) and RRT were recorded. Fluid balances at 24&#xD;
      hours and 48 hours after ICU admission and the total SB dosage administered within the first&#xD;
      48 hours were extracted. The SOFA score including each component was calculated every 24&#xD;
      hours if data were available. The Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPSII) was&#xD;
      calculated within the first 24 hours after ICU admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory variables included pH, actual bicarbonate (AB), base excess (BE), PaO2, PaCO2,&#xD;
      hematocrit (Hct), hemoglobin (Hb), lactate concentration and electrolytes such as [Na+],&#xD;
      [K+], and [Cl-]. We also calculated the anion gap (AG) by the formula AG=[Na+] + [K+] - [Cl-]&#xD;
      - [HCO3-] .&#xD;
&#xD;
      A composite of newly d/eOD within 7 days of ICU admission was used as the primary outcome of&#xD;
      this study. The secondary outcome was 28-day mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Propensity score matching (PSM) was applied to minimize either selection&#xD;
      biases or potential confounders for SBT. Continuous variables are expressed as the mean&#xD;
      (standard deviation) or median (upper quantile, lower quantile), and a t-test or the&#xD;
      Wilcoxon-test was used to compare the differences between groups. Categorical variables are&#xD;
      depicted as the number of groups (the number of percentages), and the chi-squared test or&#xD;
      Fisher's exact test was applied.Univariate and multivariat logistic regression and Cox&#xD;
      regression were used to evaluate the effectiveness of SBT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All statistical analyses were performed by R (version 3.6.1). A p value less than 0.05 was&#xD;
      indicative of statistical significance.&#xD;
