  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Open Label Extension study will enable eligible patients with Paroxysmal&#xD;
      Supraventricular Tachycardia (PSVT) who have previously participated in a Milestone&#xD;
      Pharmaceutical clinical trial of etripamil for PSVT where they received etripamil Nasal Spray&#xD;
      (NS) during a perceived PSVT episode, and experienced no significant safety issues during&#xD;
      participation, to continue treatment with etripamil NS during the Phase 3 program completion.&#xD;
      This study will be conducted by Investigators who previously participated in a Milestone&#xD;
      Pharmaceuticals clinical trials and are trained on the use of etripamil NS.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Etripamil NS addresses an unmet medical need since there are currently no short-acting&#xD;
      products available for patient self-administered treatment of episodes of PSVT. The only&#xD;
      currently available acute pharmacological therapy is IV treatment with adenosine or calcium&#xD;
      channel blockers administered in a hospital or medically supervised environment, which is&#xD;
      expensive and greatly inconveniences the patients. A self-administered product for PSVT would&#xD;
      give patients the option to safely terminate acute episodes of PSVT without the need for a&#xD;
      hospital visit and potential admission. An episodic treatment option may also allow selected&#xD;
      patients to discontinue chronic prophylactic therapy with Class I, II (e.g., beta-blockers),&#xD;
      III, and/or IV (e.g., calcium channel blockers) antiarrhythmic agents, thus avoiding the side&#xD;
      effects and quality of life implications associated with these medications. Furthermore,&#xD;
      patients weighing the risks of bridging therapy and an invasive catheter ablation procedure&#xD;
      to address their PSVT would have the opportunity to consider episodic management with&#xD;
      etripamil NS as a viable alternative treatment option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential risks of study participation include those associated with exposure to&#xD;
      etripamil NS. The side effect profile appears to be consistent with its expected pharmacology&#xD;
      as a short-acting structural analog of verapamil, as well as with its delivery as moderately&#xD;
      low pH nasal spray formulation. Adverse events associated with etripamil NS include nasal&#xD;
      irritation, nasal discomfort, and throat irritation. Potential Adverse Events (AEs), which&#xD;
      have been rare or not observed in studies to date, include other cardiac arrhythmias, and AEs&#xD;
      associated with drops in blood pressure (dizziness, headache).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary benefit of this study is that patients may be able to safely and rapidly&#xD;
      terminate acute episodes of PSVT without the need for a hospital visit to receive IV&#xD;
      medication. Patients may also be able to discontinue chronic prophylactic therapies they are&#xD;
      taking for PSVT. Patients who are waiting for, ineligible, or unwilling to undergo ablation&#xD;
      procedures may have an option for at-home treatment of their PSVT episodes.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a multicenter study to enable patients with PVST to access treatment with etripamil NS. The study will only include patients who have completed a Milestone Pharmaceuticals Inc. approved clinical research trial (NODE-301, NODE-302, or NODE-303) of etripamil NS for PSVT and experienced no significant safety issues during participation as per Investigator's assessment.&#xD;
This study is planned to continue until etripamil NS is commercially available for patients with PSVT or the study is terminated by the Sponsor for any reason.</intervention_model_description>
