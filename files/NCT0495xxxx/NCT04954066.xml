  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate association between muscular oxygen saturation and&#xD;
      postoperative acute kidney injury(AKI) in older patients undergoing abdominal surgeries.The&#xD;
      investigator also intend to explore the thresholds of muscular oxygen saturation that&#xD;
      correlate with a reduced risk of AKI and therefore have the potential to be used as&#xD;
      therapeutic targets in future.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury is one of the common and serious complications after major abdominal&#xD;
      surgeries,which a reported incidence is as high as 7.5-13.4%.The evidence shows that nearly&#xD;
      20% of elder patients with comorbidity are severely related to postoperative AKI,which lead&#xD;
      to increased complications, prolonged stays in hospital and higher mortality.What'more,even&#xD;
      smaller increases in the levels of serum creatinine (sCr) may predict worse kidney function&#xD;
      after 1or 2 years.But there is no effective treatment or strategy for acute kidney injury at&#xD;
      the moment.Therefore,early identification and prevention for AKI in perioperative period are&#xD;
      key points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanism of AKI is complex and multifaceted,which includes that surgeries or anesthesia&#xD;
      lead to renal hypoperfusion,ischemia and hypoxia. If the anesthesiologists can monitor the&#xD;
      oxygenation status of renal tissues and improve it during surgery, it may reduce the&#xD;
      incidence of AKI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a new noninvasive technique that continuously monitors&#xD;
      tissue oxygen saturation by measuring the relative concentrations of oxygenated and&#xD;
      deoxygenated hemoglobin within a local tissue area.It has been improved that perioperative&#xD;
      muscular oxygen saturation is related to patients outcome.A observational study showed an&#xD;
      association between lower intraoperative tissue oxygen saturation monitored on both sides of&#xD;
      paraspinal muscle and higher risk of postoperative AKI in patients having cardiac surgery,&#xD;
      suggesting a potential similarity of tissue perfusion and oxygenation between renal and&#xD;
      muscular tissue beds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore,in this study,the investigator hypothesizes that monitoring muscular oxygen&#xD;
      saturation on flank muscle during period may reflect some part of renal tissue oxygen&#xD;
      saturation and associate with postoperative AKI.&#xD;
