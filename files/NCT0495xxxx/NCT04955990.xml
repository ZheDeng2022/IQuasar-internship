    <measure>Change from Baseline in Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL) as Measured with emPHasis-10 Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 6 years</time_frame>
    <description>The emPHasis-10 is a short questionnaire for assessing health-related quality of life in participants with PAH. The questionnaire that consists of 10 items which address breathlessness, fatigue, control and confidence. Each item is scored on a semantic differential six-point scale (0-5), with contrasting adjectives at each end. A total emPHasis-10 score is derived using simple aggregation of the 10 items. emPHasis-10 scores range from 0 to 50, higher scores indicate worse quality of life.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline up to 6 years</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is an instrument to measure health-related quality of life consisting of a descriptive system and visual analogue scale (VAS). The descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels of perceived problems (1 indicating no problem, 2 indicating slight problems, 3 indicating moderate problems, 4 indicating severe problems, 5 indicating extreme problems). Participant selects an answer for each of 5 dimensions considering the response that best matches his or her health &quot;today&quot;. The responses to the 5 dimensions are used to compute a single score ranging from 0 (worst health state) to 100 (better health state) representing the general health status of the individual.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Health Related Quality of Life Assessed by Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: General Health (WPAI:GH)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 6 years</time_frame>
    <description>The WPAI:GH questionnaire is a patient-reported quantitative assessment. It consists of 4 types of scores: absenteeism(work time missed), presenteeism (impairment at work/reduced on-the-job effectiveness), work productivity loss (overall work impairment/absenteeism plus presenteeism) and daily activity impairment attributable to general health. WPAI outcomes are expressed as impairment percentages, with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity that is worse outcomes.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Health Related Quality of Life Assessed by Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8) item Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 6 years</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-8 is a questionnaire containing 8 items to measure the presence and severity of depression a participant is experiencing. Each item is rated on a 4-point scale (0=not at all, 1=several days, 2=more than half the days, and 3=nearly every day). The participant's item responses are summed to provide a total score (range of 0 to 24), with higher scores indicating greater severity of depressive symptoms.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline up to 6 years</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 v2 acute questionnaire is a 36-item short form survey used to assess the participant's quality of life. In the SF-36 v2 Acute Questionnaire, participants are instructed to rate their health and capacity to perform activities of daily living in eight domains including physical functioning, physical role limitations, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, emotional role limitations, and mental health during the last week. The scores range from 0 (lowest or worst possible level of functioning) to 100 (highest or best possible level of functioning).</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in PAH-specific Medication Adherence as Assessed by Morisky Medication Adherence Scale-8 (MMAS-8) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 6 years</time_frame>
    <description>The MMAS-8 is commonly used in standard clinical practice and a validated measure of treatment adherence. The MMAS-8 includes 8 questions assessing the extent of adherence or nonadherence and reasons for non-adherence. For item 1 to 7 responses will be taken as Yes or No and for item 8, 5-points Likert response scale is used. Each No response is rated as 1 and each Yes is rated as 0 , except item 5 vice versa (Yes rated 1 and No rated 0). For item 8, the code 0-4 has to be standardized by dividing the result by 4 to calculate a simulated score. Total scores on MMAS-8 ranges from 0 to 8, where 8 reflecting high adherence, 7 or 6 reflecting medium adherence, and &lt;6 reflecting low adherence.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in PAH-specific Medication Adherence as Assessed by Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension-Symptoms and Impact (PAH-SYMPACT) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 6 years</time_frame>
    <description>The PAH-SYMPACT questionnaire is a PRO instrument and composed of 2 parts: the symptoms part and the Impacts part. There is no total symptom score; the 2 domains are: cardiopulmonary symptoms and cardiovascular symptoms. The Impacts part has 2 domains: Physical Impacts Domain and Cognitive/Emotional Impacts Domain which contain 7 and 4 items, respectively. Each item has 5-point Likert response scale (0=not at all, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe, and 4=very severe). The mean individual weekly symptom item scores are aggregated by domain, with the sum then being divided by the number of symptom items in the respective domain. This leads to the average weekly domain score ranging from 0-4 for each participant with higher scores indicating greater symptom severity or worse impact.</description>
