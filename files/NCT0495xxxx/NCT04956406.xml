  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: This study aimed to determine the effect of motivational interviewing on&#xD;
      self-management of treatment regimen, medication adherence, and patient outcomes in adult&#xD;
      kidney transplant recipients between 3 months and 6 months after kidney transplant in the&#xD;
      transplant outpatient clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: The research is a single-centered, single-blind, parallel and 1:1 randomized active&#xD;
      comparative experimental study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: A total of 80 individuals, of the 40 in the control group and 40 in the intervention&#xD;
      group, will be included in the study. Motivational interview sessions for the intervention&#xD;
      group will be held 3 times between 15-30 minutes with an interval of 10 days. The control&#xD;
      group will be given routine care (approximately 1 hour of face-to-face standard training) by&#xD;
      the nurse educator. Within the research pattern, intervention and control groups will be&#xD;
      applied pre-test at the first interview and post test after one month. In addition, follow-up&#xD;
      test will be performed 3th month. The data will be obtained using the Self-Management Scale&#xD;
      in Kidney Transplant Recipients, Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for self-care and VAS for&#xD;
      medication adherence. In the study, Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for&#xD;
      Interventional Trials- SPIRIT(2013) and CONSORT 2010 (Consolidated Standards of Reporting&#xD;
      Trials) were used.&#xD;

    <description>The scale Turkish version includes 13 items, and it is likert type with 4 steps. Scale items are scored as 1 &quot;never applied&quot;, 2 &quot;applied slightly&quot;, 3 &quot;applied very often&quot; and 4 &quot;fully applied&quot;. It is recommended to perform calculation based on the item mean scores instead of an overall mean. The lowest possible score obtained from each item and sub-scale is 1 and the highest possible score is 4. The scale has no cutoff points and reversed items.</description>
