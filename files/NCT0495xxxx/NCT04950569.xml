  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic heart failure is the terminal stage of various cardiovascular diseases. It is&#xD;
      characterized with high fatality rate and high recurrence rate, which brings a heavy economic&#xD;
      burden to patients and society. Although in recent years, the long-term prognosis of patients&#xD;
      with heart failure has been greatly improved by the advances in drugs and new techniques,&#xD;
      some patients have eventually progressed to refractory heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The newly developed positive inotropic drug levosimendan is a new type of calcium sensitizer,&#xD;
      increasing the sensitivity of troponin to calcium ions, without directly increasing the&#xD;
      concentration of calcium ions in cardiomyocytes. Levosimendan improves heart function by&#xD;
      increasing myocardial contractility, dilating blood vessels, regulating coronary blood flow,&#xD;
      and also exhibits anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and anti-apoptotic effects. Compared with&#xD;
      traditional inotropic drugs, levosimendan does not increase calcium ion concentration or&#xD;
      increase oxygen consumption. And it does not easily lead to malignant arrhythmia or increase&#xD;
      the long-term mortality of patients. Because of its long half-life, intermittent use of&#xD;
      levosimendan can improve contractile function for a long time, thereby effectively&#xD;
      alleviating the symptoms of patients with advanced heart failure. Patients treated with&#xD;
      levosimendan had a higher survival rate, fewer hospitalizations, and a greatly improved&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs with important regulatory roles. They are&#xD;
      22-nucleotide single-stranded RNAs derived from endogenous hairpin structure transcripts.&#xD;
      MiRNAs are reported to be involved in the pathological process of heart remodeling. MiRNAs&#xD;
      can be secreted by cells into the peripheral blood and exist stably, which can be used as new&#xD;
      diagnostic markers for various diseases. The investigators have previously conducted&#xD;
      simultaneous detection of miRNAs in myocardial tissue and peripheral blood in patients with&#xD;
      heart failure, and conducted an epidemiological follow-up study. The investigators have&#xD;
      identified three cardiac-specific secretory miRNAs (miR-660-3p, miR-665 and miR-1285-3p)&#xD;
      which are significantly up-regulated in the plasma of patients with chronic heart failure.&#xD;
      Subsequent analysis proved them as valuable biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of&#xD;
      heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesis that the new positive inotropic drug levosimendan improve heart&#xD;
      function by regulating the miRNAs in patients with heart failure. This study aims to treat&#xD;
      patients with advanced heart failure with levosimendan. By combining the expression of&#xD;
      myocardial specific miRNAs, myocardial injury markers, hemodynamics, patient symptoms,&#xD;
      long-term prognosis and other clinical indicators, the investigators will explore the&#xD;
      relationship between the three myocardial-specific miRNAs expression and cardiac function&#xD;
      improvement by levosimendan treatment.&#xD;
