      This randomized controlled trial aims to assess the detection rate of clinically significant&#xD;
      and clinically insignificant cancer of MRI-ultrasound fusion targeted biopsy compared to&#xD;
      cognitive registration targeted biopsy in men with clinical suspicion of prostate cancer who&#xD;
      had no prior prostate biopsy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prostate biopsy with multiple samples using a standardized template (standard biopsy, SB)&#xD;
      under transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guidance is the current standard diagnostic approach in&#xD;
      suspicion of prostate cancer (PCa). However, many biopsies are unnecessary or cannot detect&#xD;
      clinically significant PCa (csPCa).&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the introduction of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) of the prostate&#xD;
      and the improvement for PCa detection and localization, an alternative procedure, known as&#xD;
      MRI-targeted biopsy (MRI-TB), has been shown comparable or even higher detection rates of&#xD;
      csPCa compared to TRUS-system biopsy (SB). MRI-ultrasound fusion TB (FUS-TB) and cognitive&#xD;
      registration TB (COG-TB) are two techniques of MRI-TB commonly used. However, the optimal&#xD;
      methodology for targeting MRI-suspicious regions remains unknown. The accuracy of COG-TB&#xD;
      compared with FUS-TB remains unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized controlled trial aims to assess the detection rate of clinically significant&#xD;
      and clinically insignificant cancer of COG-TB compared to FUS-TB (transperineal) in men&#xD;
      referred with clinical suspicion of prostate cancer who have had no prior prostate biopsy.&#xD;
