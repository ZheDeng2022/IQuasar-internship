    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective randomized controlled clinical study. After the novel Achilles&#xD;
      tendon rupture repaired , patients were randomly divided into 4 groups according to&#xD;
      immobilisation duration of 0, 2, 4, and 6 weeks, respectively. All patients underwent the&#xD;
      same suture technique with a similar rehabilitation protocol and were examined clinically at&#xD;
      2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 24, and 48 weeks to study the difference in efficacy among the&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This prospective randomized controlled clinical study is designed to compare the treatment&#xD;
      outcomes of different immobilisation duration by dividing the patients into four groups&#xD;
      according to immobilisation duration of 0, 2, 4, and 6 weeks after a similar suture&#xD;
      technique. The primary outcome was the time of return to light sports activity (LSA).&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes included range of motion (ROM) and single-legged heel rise height (SHRH).&#xD;
      Data on operation time, complications, visual analogue pain scale (VAS), American Orthopaedic&#xD;
      Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) hindfoot score, and Achilles tendon Total Rupture score (ATRS)&#xD;
      were also collected. Demographic baseline data were analysed using one-way analysis of&#xD;
      variance; outcome parameters were analysed using Kruskal-Wallis H test, and complications&#xD;
      were analysed using Fisher's exact test. Statistical significance was considered at P â‰¤ 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria were patients aged 18 to 60 years with an acute closed single-legged&#xD;
      complete ATR who underwent open surgery with our suture technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The excluded criteria were patients with prior ATR and those without rehabilitation or&#xD;
      follow-up outcomes. Other situations that affected patients' lower limb functions or tendon&#xD;
      healing (e.g. autoimmune disease, diabetes mellitus, systemic corticosteroid treatment) were&#xD;
      also excluded.&#xD;
