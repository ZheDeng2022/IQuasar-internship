    <textblock>
      This is a Multicentre, Randomized, Observer-blind, Active-Controlled, Non-inferiority Study&#xD;
      to compare the immunogenicity of VLA2101 to VLA2001.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants aged 12 years or older and who are either generally healthy or are with a stable&#xD;
      medical condition will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Cohort 1, approximately 300 participants aged 56 years or older will be enrolled in a&#xD;
      non-randomized manner to receive VLA2001 at the recommended dose level, 28 days apart, on&#xD;
      Days 1 and 29.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Cohort 2, approximately 600 participants 12 years of age or older will be randomized in a&#xD;
      1:1 ratio to receive 2 intramuscular doses of either VLA2001 (n=300) or VLA2101 (n=300), 28&#xD;
      days apart, on Days 1 and 29.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization of 56 year olds in Cohort 2 will be started once Cohort 1 has been fully&#xD;
      recruited.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 3 study is designed as a randomized, observer-blind, active-controlled, stratified&#xD;
      study, in order to demonstrate the non-inferiority of the immunogenicity of VLA2101 vaccine&#xD;
      to VLA2001 vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will serve two purposes. On the one hand, safety and immunogenicity data in&#xD;
      volunteers aged 56 years and older will be generated (Cohort 1) to strengthen the database&#xD;
      for this age group. On the other hand, immuno-bridging of Valneva's VLA2101 vaccine to&#xD;
      VLA2001 will be performed, complemented by the respective safety comparison (Cohort 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants enrolled for Cohort 1 will receive the study treatment in an open-label manner&#xD;
      to confirm the safety and immunogenicity of VLA2001.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the study population enrolled in Cohort 2 the study will be observer blinded to the&#xD;
      Investigators and study team. However, the pharmacists/ nurses who prepare the vaccination&#xD;
      will not be blinded since the packaging of the 2 vaccines is different. Observers (i.e.&#xD;
      investigators and study team performing any study related assessments) remain blinded to&#xD;
      minimize possibility of a safety bias by the participants and/or Investigator's or staff&#xD;
      performing medical safety assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose level tested in this study was selected based on the results of the Phase 1/2 study&#xD;
      VLA2001-201 of 150 participants aged 18 to 55 years.&#xD;
