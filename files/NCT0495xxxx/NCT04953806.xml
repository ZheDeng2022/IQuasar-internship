  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is prevalent and debilitating chronic disease in&#xD;
      Veterans. COPD is highly co-morbid with depression and anxiety conferring greater morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality risk. Physical activity is a modifiable behavior that can improve COPD&#xD;
      outcomes. However, to date, interventions targeting physical activity have not addressed the&#xD;
      high comorbidity between COPD and depression and/or anxiety symptoms (&quot;emotional distress&quot;)&#xD;
      despite emotional distress predicting poorer response to physical activity interventions.&#xD;
      This CDA-2 proposal will develop and test the feasibility and limited-efficacy of an&#xD;
      integrative physical activity and mental health intervention for Veterans with COPD,&#xD;
      emotional distress, and low physical activity. The intervention will be delivered via VA&#xD;
      Video Connect enabling access to care among Veterans with substantial barriers to&#xD;
      hospital-based outpatient care.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will develop and test the feasibility and limited-efficacy of a combined physical&#xD;
      activity (PA) and cognitive-behavioral therapy intervention (bCBT) for Veterans with COPD,&#xD;
      emotional distress (clinically significant depression and anxiety), and low PA level. Prior&#xD;
      research has shown that combined PA+CBT interventions produce superior physical and emotional&#xD;
      outcomes in heart failure and diabetes patients. Drawing from this body of literature, the&#xD;
      research team will develop and test the feasibility and limited-efficacy of an integrated&#xD;
      PA+CBT intervention (Step-CBT) tailored and adapted to COPD patients and delivered via VA&#xD;
      Video Connect (VVC). Step-CBT will be an integrated intervention based on established&#xD;
      interventions: pedometer-based PA intervention and bCBT. In order to develop Step-CBT, the&#xD;
      research team will first conduct mixed-methods interviews with (n=20) Veterans with COPD.&#xD;
      Mixed-methods data will identify target behaviors, emotions, and cognitions related to&#xD;
      emotional distress and PA, and the research team will integrate this content with existing&#xD;
      content included in pedometer-based PA intervention and bCBT. The research team will provide&#xD;
      specific language based on patients' lived experience and mirror the language they use to&#xD;
      describe their experience. The research team will tailor examples, home exercises, and&#xD;
      psychoeducation based on the data collected. The investigators will adapt to delivery over&#xD;
      VVC. Step-CBT will then be tested for acceptability with (n=5) Veterans. Acceptability data&#xD;
      will be reviewed and submitted to the multidisciplinary expert panel for review and&#xD;
      modifications of the treatment protocol will be made based on this process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next, Step-CBT will be delivered to Veterans (n=32) compared to enhanced usual care (UC; n =&#xD;
      16) matched for social interaction enrolled through 2:1 randomization for feasibility and&#xD;
      limited-efficacy testing with a two week run-in period. Step-CBT will target primary outcomes&#xD;
      of step count and patient-reported disability (LLDFI Disability Component), and secondary&#xD;
      outcomes of emotional distress (PHQ-9 and BAI). The investigators will measure within-group&#xD;
      change in Step-CBT (n=32) and wait-list control (WLC) (n=16) groups from baseline to&#xD;
      post-assessment (Week 15). The research team will also compare between-group differences&#xD;
      across outcomes. When available, minimally important differences will be used to guide&#xD;
      analyses. This study will leverage advances in telehealth interventions. Step-CBT will be&#xD;
      deliverable to Veterans' home bypassing numerous barriers to hospital-based care and&#xD;
      increasing access to more Veterans with COPD.&#xD;

    <measure>Measuring change - Late Life Function and Disability Instrument (LLFDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 15 - measuring change</time_frame>
    <description>Change in scores on the Late Life Function and Disability Instrument (LLFDI) from baseline to Week 15. The LLFDI is a 32-item measure of self-reported functional impairment and disability. Respondents indicate the degree of difficulty they have performing physical activities without the help of someone or using assistive devices. Scores range from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating higher levels of functioning. We will only use the Disability component of the LLDFI. The LLDFI is sensitive to change and commonly used as an outcome in geriatric research.</description>

    <measure>Step Count-measuring change</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6, Week 15- measuring change</time_frame>
    <description>Change in Step Count. We reference prior MID for estimates of change: Minimally Important Difference = 600-1000 steps. Step count will be measured with the StepWatch Activity Monitor (SAM). The SAM is FDA-approved and highly accurate measure of activity, through the use of a special sensor detecting acceleration, position, and timing, to detect steps. The device is worn around the ankle and unobtrusive. The FitBit Inspire serves as a tool to track step count goals.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Health Questionniare-9- measuring change</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 15- measuring change</time_frame>
    <description>Change in scores on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) from baseline to Week 15. Meaningful change in the literature is PHQ-9 score (&lt; = 9 combined with improvement of 50%). The PHQ-9 is a 9-item measure of depression symptoms severity mapping on to DSM-IV criteria. Higher scores are indicative of more severe depression symptoms. Score range from 0 to 27, with higher scores indicative of greater depression symptom severity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Beck Anxiety Inventory- measuring change</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 15- measuring change</time_frame>
    <description>Change in scores on the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) from baseline to Week 15. Meaningful change in the literature is a 17.5% reduction in BAI scores over time. The BAI is a 21-item screening measure of cognitive and somatic symptoms of anxiety over the past week. Respondents indicate the degree to which they experienced each symptom from 0 (not at all) to 3 (severely), ranging from 0 to 63. Higher scores indicated greater anxiety severity.</description>
