    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled trial of auricular acupuncture for sleep disturbances.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective 1: Evaluate the effectiveness of a specific protocol of auricular acupuncture&#xD;
           in the treatment of sleep disturbance among active duty and otherDoD beneficiaries.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective 2: Test whether a brief course of auricular acupuncture treatments among&#xD;
           active duty and other DoD beneficiaries with sleep disturbance willalso decrease&#xD;
           severity of anxiety, depression, pain and improve sleep and social functioning in&#xD;
           subgroup analysis of subjects with known or newlydiagnosed mental health disorders&#xD;
           (e.g., anxiety disorders, depression).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Null Hypothesis: Auricular Acupuncture has no effect on sleep disturbance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alternative Hypothesis: Auricular Acupuncture reduces sleep disturbance.&#xD;

      Active duty members and DoD beneficiaries aged 18-80 years old and meeting the&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be offered an opportunity to participate.They will be&#xD;
      recruited from the clinics at 99MDG (Nellis AFB), 96MDG (Eglin AFB), and 375 MDG (Scott AFB).&#xD;
      All of the below items are research-relatedunless marked as 'standard of care'. All visits&#xD;
      will last approximately 30 minutes in length.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obtain and document signed Informed Consent document and HIPAA Authorization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review past medical history to verify the inclusion/exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We will record health care resource utilization to include Number of hospital or clinic&#xD;
           visits (previous encounters) for sleep problems in the past 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medication use (Sleep medications, stimulant medications, energy drinks at least&#xD;
           once/week), co-morbidities, phone number, e-mail address, dateof birth, gender, race,&#xD;
           ethnicity, highest education level, total number of children in household), Service&#xD;
           characteristics (officer, enlisted, retired)(service branch), History of deployment&#xD;
           (never deployed, previously deployed, number of deployments), Usual Work pattern (Day,&#xD;
           night),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record whether the subject has a history of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) and whether it&#xD;
           is treated or untreated. If treated, do they use aContinuous Positive Airway Pressure&#xD;
           (CPAP) or Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP) machine? If patient uses CPAP/BiPAP,&#xD;
           do they use it atleast 70% of the time as reported by patient or CPAP/BiPAP recent data&#xD;
           pull in medical record. These questions are asked due to a possiblerelationship between&#xD;
           OSA and sleep disturbance (3); those who have OSA and do not use a CPAP or use one&#xD;
           infrequently need to be accounted forso as to not to confound data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PROMIS-16 Sleep-Related Impairment Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who score a medium or severe on the PROMIS-16 (T-Score greater than or equal to 60).&#xD;
      Sleep-Related Impairment Scale will berandomized into one of two groups and the intervention&#xD;
      will be performed. The investigators acknowledge that any of these standard treatmentsmay be&#xD;
      shorter or longer in duration than the duration of the study. There is no additional risk to&#xD;
      subjects for continuing to track their sleeppatterns and mental health scores on various&#xD;
      instruments shorter or longer than standard of care treatments. Furthermore, this study is&#xD;
      meant tobe a pragmatic trial-there are many evidence based and not evidence based treatments&#xD;
      for sleep disturbance that are considered standard ofcare. We seek to allow any of these&#xD;
      treatments to proceed and evaluate the addition of auricular acupuncture as it can be applied&#xD;
      in a clinic setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1: Standard treatment from Primary Care Manager (PCM) or Mental Health or both&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2: Standard treatment from PCM or Mental Health or both + auricular Acupuncture&#xD;

    <description>MYMOP employs a 7-point scale (0=as good as it could be, 6=as bad as it could be) for individual items of Symptoms, Activity, and Wellbeing as well as the MYMOP profile score. Normative values are neither available nor meaningful for the MYMOP as it is individual to each patient; however, a clinically meaningful change is considered to be a change in the scores of more than 1.</description>

    <description>Auricular acupuncture treatments will be utilizing ASP needles. The needles will stay in and fall out on their own (usually 3-10 days). For some patients who are acupuncture naïve, Seirin 15mm needles will be placed and allowed to remain for 45 minutes. This option will be provided to all subjects for their first treatment. Auricular acupuncture treatment possible locations will be as defined as: Master Cerebral/Prefrontal cortex, Amygdala, Hippocampus, Hypothalamus, Point Zero, Shen Men, Insomnia 1,Insomnia 2 OR Prefrontal Cortex, Reticular formation, Pineal gland, Hypothalamus, Point zero. In acupuncture parlance, the patient will be treated with ATP plus sleep I on first visit, then the acupuncturist will continue to use that treatment for each subsequent visit with the potential to add ATP plus sleep II. Both ears will be treated unless the patient requests that one be left open. The acupuncturist may use sleep I in one ear and sleep II in the other.</description>
