  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Suicide is a leading cause of death for children and adolescents. Since warning signs of&#xD;
      suicide and links to precipitating events differ between age groups, suicide can be difficult&#xD;
      to predict. As a result, children often seek care for suicidal ideation (SI) in the emergency&#xD;
      department (ED) where a limited number of treatment options exist. Current psychotherapies&#xD;
      and pharmacotherapies, such as antidepressants, provide benefit over weeks or months and thus&#xD;
      limits their effective application in the ED. Consequently, when there is an imminent threat&#xD;
      to the child's safety, the typical management solution is to admit the patient to a safe&#xD;
      environment and hopefully de-escalate over time. To address a more rapid-onset treatment&#xD;
      option for SI, a number of studies in adults have suggested that a single, sub-anesthetic&#xD;
      dose of intravenous ketamine can rapidly reduce depression and SI severity. These results are&#xD;
      promising, but large-scale trials are needed to determine if ketamine is a safe and effective&#xD;
      treatment for acute suicidality in the pediatric population. This approach has the benefit of&#xD;
      working rapidly, avoiding involuntary hospitalizations, and protecting patients from&#xD;
      self-harm until they can be connected to longer term mental health resources. This study will&#xD;
      compare the use of intravenous ketamine to both active and placebo controls in children 10 to&#xD;
      17 years of age presenting to the pediatric ED for SI. The primary objective of this pilot&#xD;
      trial is to explore the adequacy and range of three instruments measuring suicidality and to&#xD;
      determine the sample size required for a large definitive randomized control trial. This&#xD;
      larger trial will be used to estimate the effectiveness of intravenous ketamine for reducing&#xD;
      SI in children in the pediatric ED. The secondary objectives are to assess study feasibility&#xD;
      and optimize study procedures. Given very few side effects reported in adult studies and the&#xD;
      relatively benign nature of those reported, the investigators do not expect any major safety&#xD;
      concerns in the study.&#xD;

    <measure>Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>90 minutes post infusion</time_frame>
    <description>The CSSR-S is 6-point scale that measures SI severity via clinical interviews, ranging from 1 (wish to be dead) to 5 (suicidal intent with plan). Adolescents who deny any SI receive a 0. The distribution of &quot;yes&quot; responses on questions 3, 4, or 5 will be assessed from baseline. Higher scores indicate greater SI severity.</description>

    <measure>Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>90 minutes post infusion</time_frame>
    <description>The MADRS is a 10-item, 6-point scale that screens for depressive symptoms in adults via clinical interviews. A self-reported version (MADRS-self assessment) which has been validated in adolescents will be used, but only the final item that is specific to SI (item 10) will be asked. The distribution of scores from 0 to 6 will be assessed from baseline. Higher scores indicate greater SI severity.</description>

    <measure>Pragmatic questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>90 minutes post infusion</time_frame>
    <description>The pragmatic questionnaire is a brief, one sentence question designed to assess change in SI. Participants will be asked &quot;How suicidal do you feel on a scale of 0 to 10?&quot;. The distribution of scores from 0 to 10 will be assessed from baseline. Higher scores indicate greater SI severity.</description>
