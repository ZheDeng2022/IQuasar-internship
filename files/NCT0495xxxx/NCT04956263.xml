  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an inpatient treatment, double-blind, randomized, 3-way crossover study in T1DM&#xD;
      subjects using insulin pump therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be randomized to one of 6 treatment sequences. The randomized study drug will&#xD;
      be administered once daily for 7 days throughout each of 3 treatment periods. Each subject&#xD;
      will attend an in-house baseline period, the NoTreatment period, and 3 in-house treatment&#xD;
      periods, The Active Periods, where the same assessments will be performed. At each of the&#xD;
      in-house periods, a MMTT will be carried out on the sixth day of dosing and an insulin&#xD;
      withdrawal test will be carried out on the seventh day of dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postprandial glycemic excursion after a MMTT will be evaluated one day prior to an insulin&#xD;
      withdrawal test. An insulin pumps with different modes (such as open loop/closed loop) the&#xD;
      mode used at screening will be the mode used throughout the study. Unblinded continuous&#xD;
      glucose monitoring (CGM) will be initiated at the start of the 7-day Baseline Period (Day -7)&#xD;
      and discontinued at End of Treatment (Day 34).&#xD;
