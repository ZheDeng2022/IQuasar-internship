      To analyze the surgical conditions of 64 patients with lateral patella excessive compression&#xD;
      syndrome who were surgically treated by Deputy Chief Physician Yang Yuping of the Department&#xD;
      of Sports Medicine, Peking University Third Hospital from September 2004 to January 2019.&#xD;
      Among them, 24 early cases used the traditional proximal release of the lateral retinaculum&#xD;
      (traditional surgical group), and recently 40 cases, after learning from the surgical&#xD;
      experience of the early cases, switched to the lateral release of the lateral retinaculum,&#xD;
      that is, &quot;L&quot; type Release (new surgery group). The visual analog scale (VAS), Lysholm score,&#xD;
      and IKDC knee function subjective evaluation scale (IKDC) score were performed before and&#xD;
      after the operation. By analyzing the knee movement scores of patients before and after&#xD;
      surgery, the efficacy of the above two operations was judged, and the two groups of&#xD;
      postoperative scores were evaluated.&#xD;
