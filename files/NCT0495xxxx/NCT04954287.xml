  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 1 trial is an open-label trial to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of two dosages (10^6 PFU and 10^7 PFU) of intranasal CVXGA1 administered as a&#xD;
      single dose in two age groups, 18-55 and 56-75.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CVXGA1 intranasal COVID-19 vaccine will be administered by dose escalation (low dose to high&#xD;
      dose) and age escalation in 80 healthy adults aged 18 to 75 years (younger adults to older&#xD;
      adults), with approximately 12 months' follow-up. Safety data from sentinel subjects assessed&#xD;
      by a safety monitoring committee (SMC) for 1) vaccine administration to the remaining&#xD;
      subjects within the group, 2) progression from low dose (1 x 10^6 PFU) to high dose (1 x 10^7&#xD;
      PFU) and 3) progression from the young adult cohort (18 to 55 years) to the older adult&#xD;
      cohort (56 to 75 years).&#xD;
