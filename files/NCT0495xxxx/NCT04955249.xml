  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Delirium is common in the elderly after hip fracture surgery, and is associated with worse&#xD;
      outcomes. The investigators hypothesize that, for elderly patients after hip fracture&#xD;
      surgery, dexmedetomidine supplemented analgesia can reduce the incidence of delirium and&#xD;
      improve the long-term outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Delirium is a common complication in patients after hip fracture surgery and is associated&#xD;
      with worse outcomes, including prolonged hospital stay, poor functional recovery, decreased&#xD;
      cognitive function, increased health care costs, and elevated mortality rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The etiology of delirium is multifactorial and include severe pain and sleep disturbances&#xD;
      after surgery, as well as surgery-related inflammation. Dexmedetomidine is a selective alpha&#xD;
      2 receptor agonist. It exerts sedative effects by activating the endogenous sleep-promoting&#xD;
      pathway and leads to a state like non-rapid eye movement sleep. It produces analgesic effects&#xD;
      by activating the alpha2a adrenergic receptor subtype in the spinal cord. Perioperative&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine also alleviates the degree of surgery-related inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies showed that, for elderly patients admitted to the intensive care unit after&#xD;
      non-cardiac surgery, low-dose dexmedetomidine infusion improved subjective sleep quality and&#xD;
      reduced delirium early after surgery; it also increased survival up to 2 years and improved&#xD;
      life quality in 3-year survivors. The investigators hypothesize that dexmedetomidine&#xD;
      supplemented patient-controlled analgesia can also reduce delirium and improve long-term&#xD;
      outcomes in elderly patients after hip fracture surgery.&#xD;
