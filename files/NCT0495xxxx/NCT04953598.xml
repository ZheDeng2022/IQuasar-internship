    <textblock>
      In this study, ultrasound diagnosis was performed for patients with hip joint anterior&#xD;
      superior labrum tear, and the final surgical observation was used as the gold standard to&#xD;
      evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of ultrasonic measurement of the hip joint anterior superior&#xD;
      labrum area in the diagnosis of labrum tear.&#xD;

      In this study, ultrasound diagnosis was performed for patients with a torn anterior superior&#xD;
      labrum of the hip joint, and the final surgical observation was the gold standard. The&#xD;
      control group selected patients with non-hip joint reasons to come to the ultrasound&#xD;
      department of our hospital for diagnosis at the same time. Both the case group and the&#xD;
      control group were included in the study at a rate of 1.1 times. This study plans to include&#xD;
      149 cases in the case group and 297 cases in the control group. This study was used to&#xD;
      evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of ultrasonic measurement of the area of the anterior&#xD;
      superior labrum of the hip in the diagnosis of labrum tears.&#xD;
