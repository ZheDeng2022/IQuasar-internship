      Establishing a definitive airway defined as a tube placed in the trachea with cuff inflated&#xD;
      below the vocal cords is the first priority in the airway management of the pre-hospital&#xD;
      trauma patient, according to the last edition of the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS)&#xD;
      textbook, of the American College of Surgeons. However, studies revealed that the success&#xD;
      rate of tracheal intubation in the prehospital setting using direct laryngoscopy (DL), the&#xD;
      standard intubation technique is suboptimal. The Advance Trauma Life Support suggested the&#xD;
      use of Supraglottic Airway Devise in managing the difficult airway. The air-Q SP 3G was&#xD;
      introduced as an alternative for managing the difficult airway The i-gel is proposed as&#xD;
      supraglottic device made of a medical grade thermoplastic elastomer. It unique design does&#xD;
      not need an inflate cuff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomize controlled trail will be conduce. Participants will insert the both supraglottic&#xD;
      to compare performance of ventilation and oxygenation of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The insertion will be performed on age 18-75 year patients, scheduled for elective surgery&#xD;
      with general anesthesia. The SAD use in the study will be a single use i-gel size 4 or 5 and&#xD;
      the air-Q SP 3G- size 4 or 5 For induction of anesthesia all patients will receive&#xD;
      premedication. After 3 min of preoxygenation anesthesia will induce with up to 2 mcg/Kg&#xD;
      fentanyl and 2-3 mg propofol Neuromuscular blockade will be obtained with rocuronion The&#xD;
      participant will performed one insertion of the i-gel or the air-Q SP 3G on the patient while&#xD;
      manual in-line stabilization of the neck Primary outcome: insertion success rate Secondary&#xD;
      outcome : duration in secons of insertion&#xD;

      In the combat setting, airway compromise is the second leading cause of preventable death&#xD;
      after hemorrhage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Establishing a definitive airway defined as a tube placed in the trachea with cuff inflated&#xD;
      below the vocal cords is the first priority in the airway management of the pre-hospital&#xD;
      trauma patient, according to the last edition of the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS)&#xD;
      textbook, of the American College of Surgeons. However, studies revealed that the success&#xD;
      rate of tracheal intubation in the prehospital setting using direct laryngoscopy (DL), the&#xD;
      standard intubation technique is suboptimal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible reasons for the failure in achieving definitive airway in trauma patients are the&#xD;
      requirement for in-line stabilization of the neck, and the inexperience of the providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC) Guidelines recommend using a supraglottic airway&#xD;
      device (SAD) as an option to assist in securing the airway in tactical evacuation phase of&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent published Randomized Control Trail in patients, the success of blind intubation&#xD;
      did not support the use of tracheal intubation (TI) via iLTS-D by novice intubators. However,&#xD;
      this study revealed a high success rate (84.6%) of iLTS-D placement in the oropharynx,&#xD;
      associated with effective ventilation as confirmed by capnography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time to obtain successful iLTS-D placement in the oropharynx was 42 sec, which is 2.5&#xD;
      times shorter than the time to achieve TI with DL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These results encourage the use of a second generation Supraglottic Airway Device (SAD) by&#xD;
      novice intubators as the first airway intervention in trauma patients, who require immediate&#xD;
      airway management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SADs play a key role as primary and rescue devices in predicted and unanticipated difficult&#xD;
      airway management, by providing both a patent airway for oxygenation and ventilation and a&#xD;
      conduit for TI, thereby avoiding the disastrous outcomes of 'cannot intubate, cannot&#xD;
      oxygenate' situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently study reported the effectiveness of initial insertion with Laryngeal Tube (LT) vs&#xD;
      initial Endotracheal Intubation (ETI) in adults out of Hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA).This&#xD;
      study concludes that a strategy of initial LT insertion was associated with significantly&#xD;
      greater 72-hour survival compare with the strategy of initial ETI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These findings suggest that SAD insertion may be considered as an initial airway management&#xD;
      strategy in patients with OHCA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The implication of the SAD effectivity in fasting rescue the airway pattern and reassure&#xD;
      oxygenation is greatest importance in combat setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The self-pressurized air-Q intubating laryngeal airway (air-Q SP 3G) (Mercury Medical,&#xD;
      Clearwater, FL, USA) is a single-use SAD that does not require cuff inflation. The original&#xD;
      air-Q intubating laryngeal airway (Cookgas LLC; Mercury Medical) was designed to facilitate&#xD;
      tracheal intubation through its lumen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The air-Q SP 3G differs from the original air-Q by the absence of an inflatable cuff and the&#xD;
      continuity between the airway tube and cuff through an inner aperture at the junction the&#xD;
      airway tube and periglottic cuff of the air-Q SP 3G makes the intracuff pressure equilibrate&#xD;
      dynamically with the airway pressure and is designed to adjust to the patient's pharyngeal&#xD;
      and periglottic anatomy .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The absence of a pilot balloon and continuity between the airway tube and the cuff through an&#xD;
      inner aperture has several clinical benefits when compared with other cuffed SAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, the provider does not loose time with the inflation cuff maneuver. Second, intra-cuff&#xD;
      pressures are determined by the airway pressures, because of the equalization of pressures&#xD;
      with the movement of gas between the cuff and airway tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Third, lower intra-cuff pressures are maintained overall as a result of being limited by the&#xD;
      peak airway pressures, with the highest pressures exerted during inspiration. Fourth, by not&#xD;
      exceeding peak airway pressures, the balance between intra-cuff pressures and the airway seal&#xD;
      of the device may be optimized at lower pressure. Therefore, the risk of sore throat,&#xD;
      neuropraxic injury, and gastric insufflation seen with overinflation of traditional cuffed&#xD;
      supraglottic devices may be reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the air-Q SP 3G has been upgraded with the addition of the gastric channel in order&#xD;
      diminish the risk of aspiration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The i-gel second generation SAD, disposable airway (Intersurgical Ltd, Workingham, UK) is a&#xD;
      SAD made of a medical grade thermoplastic elastomer. Its unique design does not need an&#xD;
      inflatable cuff because the thermoplastic elastomer provides the seal. The i-gel is gaining a&#xD;
      reputation for its ease of insertion and for its use in many clinical situations. Previous&#xD;
      studies have demonstrated that the i-gel can be placed more faster than conventional&#xD;
      laryngeal mask airways, which might play a role in prehospital settings. Other advantages of&#xD;
      the i-gel are ease of training, cost, safety, and simplicity of use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been no studies comparing these devices in patients with limited neck extension.&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim is to compare the clinical performance of these two devices in adult&#xD;
      patients with simulated cervical immobilization.&#xD;
