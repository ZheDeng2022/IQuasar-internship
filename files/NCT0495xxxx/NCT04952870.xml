  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some evidence exists that SARS-COV-2 may infect pituitary axis, and therefore may alter&#xD;
      hypothalamic function. Whether perinatal COVID-19 is associated with alterations in the&#xD;
      maturation of the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Gonadal (HPG) axis, and specifically with its&#xD;
      transient activation occurring during infancy, namely minipuberty, is a major concern. Among&#xD;
      the various pathogenic features related to COVID-19, altered minipuberty could be a key&#xD;
      factor underlying many multimorbidities later in life, suggesting that they could involve a&#xD;
      common causative mechanism that occurs within this short and critical period of time&#xD;
      following birth. Altered minipuberty together with NO deficiency seem to be key factors&#xD;
      underlying many of these multimorbidities, suggesting that they involve a common causative&#xD;
      mechanism that occurs within this short and critical period of time following birth&#xD;

    <description>The ASQ-3 is a questionnaire aimed to pinpoint developmental progress in children between 1 month to 5.5 years in age. It is parent-centric and is administered through paper and pencil. It takes 10 to 15 minutes to complete. Change in score will be calculated by comparing ASQ-3 scores of FNI and non-FNI participants by measuring across five developmental areas: communication, gross motor, fine motor, problem solving, and personal-social.</description>

    <measure>Bayley-III score</measure>
    <time_frame>at the corrected age of 9 months of age</time_frame>
    <description>The Bayley Scale of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition (Bayley III) measures physical, motor, sensory, and cognitive development in babies and young children. The scale encompasses five developmental domains - cognitive, language, motor, social-emotional and adaptive behaviour. The structure of the Bayley-III Scales allows clinicians to administer each of the five scales (cognitive, language-receptive and expressive, motor-fine and gross, social-emotional, and adaptive behaviour) independent of others. Higher scores in each scale indicates more advanced development. Performance is summarised via scaled scores for each subtest, and composite scores for each scale, together with percentile ranks, developmental age equivalents, and growth scores. Discrepancy information is used to determine whether there are significant differences between a child's abilities in the domains measured, and how prevalent these differences are in the norming sample. A total score is not provided.</description>
