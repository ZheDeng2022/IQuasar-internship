      I. Research Background In the &quot;Twelfth Five-Year Plan for Biotechnology Development&quot;, the&#xD;
      requirements for the construction of national biological science facilities are clearly put&#xD;
      forward, and the construction of a national biological center, which includes the biological&#xD;
      technology management information database and biological sample resource database.Biobank&#xD;
      mainly refers to the standardized collection, processing, storage and application of&#xD;
      biomacromolecules, cells, tissues and organs of healthy and disease organisms, including&#xD;
      human organ tissues, whole blood, plasma, serum, biological fluid or processed biological&#xD;
      samples (DNA, RNA, protein, etc.).Establish a standardized quality control, information&#xD;
      management and application system for samples 1.In 1987 the American Institute of Cancer&#xD;
      Research established a biobank of cancer samples.The UK Biobank was set up in 1999 to collect&#xD;
      and closely monitor samples from 500,000 volunteers.At the same time, domestic and foreign&#xD;
      research institutions are also jointly building and sharing biobanks.Europe, for example, has&#xD;
      carried out genetic studies involving 520,000 people in 23 sample centers in 10 European&#xD;
      countries.Human genetic resources are important strategic resources, China has a unique&#xD;
      advantage of human genetic resources, effective protection and rational use of human genetic&#xD;
      resources is very important.Proper collection of abundant and large sample resources is bound&#xD;
      to provide great value for biological and medical research 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sports medicine institute, Peking University third hospital is the largest sports medicine&#xD;
      center, about 120000 m years MenZhenLiang, nearly 10000 years since, before the operation&#xD;
      exsanguinate assay blood samples in laboratory tests, after the completion of the operation&#xD;
      clean up the damage of tissue samples at the end of the surgery, for medical waste, by&#xD;
      medical waste treatment, but the samples has high research value.From including&#xD;
      morphological, genetic and molecular mechanism study 4-6, for sample tissue pathological&#xD;
      slices, gene sequencing and other research methods to the field of sports medicine related&#xD;
      diseases have a deeper understanding, and provide samples for future researchers reserve&#xD;
      platform, to build samples of sports medicine institute library.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sports injuries and joint structural abnormalities are multi-factor causes. Through the&#xD;
      establishment of this project and the collection of intraoperative tissue, blood and saliva&#xD;
      samples from patients with sports injuries, including degenerative osteoarthritis, admitted&#xD;
      to the Institute of Sports Medicine of the Third Hospital of Beijing Medical University,To&#xD;
      sample from the micro level of susceptibility genes and molecular signaling pathways to&#xD;
      anatomical morphology and histopathologic study direction, and so on, can also for multiple&#xD;
      transverse comparison research between samples, in order to investigate sports injury,&#xD;
      including degenerative osteoarthritis pathogenesis, for sports trauma related disease&#xD;
      etiology, diagnosis, treatment to provide new ideas and methods,And the selection of&#xD;
      athletes, athletes special training plans, sports mode to provide more targeted suggestions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Research Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. After the completion of the laboratory examination, the blood samples and tissue samples&#xD;
           and body fluids discarded during the operation are retained for the purpose of building&#xD;

      inpatients, follow-up patients and third-class blood relatives or close relatives of patients&#xD;
      with degenerative osteoarthritis, cruciate ligament injury, patella dislocation, discoid&#xD;
      meniscus who were admitted to the Institute of Sports Medicine of the Third Hospital of&#xD;
      Peking University voluntarily enrolled in the biobase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 Sample collection and preservation&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. For patients undergoing sports injury surgery, intraoperative tissue stump (divided into&#xD;
           2 pieces) and remaining whole blood samples (1.5 mL/piece, a total of 3 pieces) were&#xD;
           mainly collected. Meanwhile, genetic information was extracted and preserved for some&#xD;
           samples.In strict accordance with the standardized operation process of project samples,&#xD;
           samples are processed and stored separately in the warehouse, and stored in the -80℃&#xD;
           ultra-low temperature refrigerator or -196℃ liquid nitrogen tank.Patient related imaging&#xD;
           and surgical data were recorded and saved by the hospital system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The remaining whole blood samples (1.5 mL/piece, 3 pieces in total) and saliva samples&#xD;
           (about 3 mL/piece) were mainly collected from the other subjects except the patients&#xD;
           undergoing surgery. At the same time, genetic information of some samples was extracted&#xD;
           and stored.In strict accordance with the standardized operation process of project&#xD;
           samples, samples are processed and stored separately in the warehouse, and stored in the&#xD;
           -80℃ ultra-low temperature refrigerator or -196℃ liquid nitrogen tank.Relevant imaging&#xD;
           and surgical data were recorded from previous medical records or provided by the&#xD;
           subjects themselves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Biobank preservation and management The biobank is in strict compliance with the&#xD;
      Regulations of the People's Republic of China on the Management of Human Genetic Resources&#xD;
      for sample storage, processing and management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1 Quality control of sample warehousing In strict accordance with the standardized&#xD;
      operation process of project samples, samples are processed and stored separately in the&#xD;
      warehouse, and stored in the -80℃ ultra-low temperature refrigerator or -196℃ liquid nitrogen&#xD;
      tank.For genetic extraction of tissue samples, blood and saliva samples, ensure that the&#xD;
      total number of samples is at least 1ug, and ensure that the sample OD 260/280 is close to&#xD;
      2.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Sample information management The sample information was managed electronically by the&#xD;

      records including sample processing, packing, warehousing, quality inspection, freeze-thaw,&#xD;
      loss reporting, etc., and relevant documents signed by the operator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3 Safety of sample environment The environmental safety of samples is managed according to&#xD;
      the standard of the biobank of Peking University Third Hospital. Automatic monitoring system&#xD;
      of temperature, humidity and environment is adopted to collect and record the samples in real&#xD;
      time.In case of any abnormality, the system will inform the management staff of the biobank&#xD;
      of the Institute of Sports Medicine of our hospital through SMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4 Regular quality inspection of samples Quality tests were carried out according to the&#xD;
      standards of the biobank of Peking University Third Hospital. Quality tests of DNA, RNA,&#xD;
      tissue samples and cell activity were carried out regularly to ensure the accuracy of the&#xD;
      results obtained from the samples for subsequent studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Basic research related to biological samples The collected biological samples were&#xD;
      sequenced and analyzed for genetic information, tissue morphology, and expression&#xD;
      determination and analysis of related biomolecules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four, data management:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Data entry:&#xD;
&#xD;
           According to the original observation records of the subjects, the researchers will&#xD;
           timely, complete, correct and clear data into the case report form.After being reviewed&#xD;
           and signed by the principal investigator, the questionnaire should be sent to the&#xD;
           clinical study data administrator in a timely manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Contents and methods of data verification and management:&#xD;
&#xD;
           When all case report forms are checked without error, the data manager will write the&#xD;
           database inspection report, which includes the study completion status (including the&#xD;
           list of exclusions), inclusion/exclusion criteria, integrity check, logical consistency&#xD;
           check, outlier data check, time window check, adverse event check, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
           At the audit meeting, the principal investigator, data administrator and statisticians&#xD;
           will make decisions on subjects' signing of informed consent and questions raised in the&#xD;
           database inspection report, and write the audit report. The database will be locked at&#xD;
           the same time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Data archiving:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After data entry and verification as required, the case report form shall be archived in&#xD;
      numbered order and filled in with the retrieval directory for future reference.Electronic&#xD;
      data files, including databases, inspection procedures, analysis procedures, analysis&#xD;
      results, codebooks and explanatory files, should be classified and stored in multiple backups&#xD;
      on different disks or recording media. They should be properly stored to prevent damage.All&#xD;
      original files shall be kept for the specified period of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Safety evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no special risk associated with participation in this study.The sampling process of&#xD;
      tissue samples will not affect the quantity and quality of blood tests and examinations of&#xD;
      patients before surgery, nor will it affect the surgical method of patients, nor will it&#xD;
      affect the choice of surgical method by the surgeon. Therefore, there will be no change in&#xD;
      preoperative preparation, intraoperative operation and surgical effect, and there will be no&#xD;
      related risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study will not increase any medical history and illness inquiries,&#xD;
      physical examination content, blood tests, auxiliary examinations such as X-ray, CT, MRI and&#xD;
      B-mode ultrasound, and will not increase any fees.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Subject Protection (Informed Consent, Subject's Benefits and Risks, Confidentiality,&#xD;
      Conflict of Interest and Other Ethical Consideration) According to relevant Chinese laws and&#xD;
      regulations, before the start of the study, the researcher shall give written and oral&#xD;
      explanations to the subjects regarding the background, nature, significance, steps, benefits,&#xD;
      risks and withdrawal of the study, etc., and an informed consent signed by each subject (or&#xD;
      legal representative of the subject) shall be obtained.The informed consent form is dated and&#xD;
      its copy is kept separately by the investigator and the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seven, research management&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Scheme modification (define the principle and process of scheme modification after the&#xD;
           project starts) It could be that the researchers found persistent non-compliance with&#xD;
           the inclusion criteria caused the change, or it could be that the inclusion criteria&#xD;
           were too strict and the number of recruits was too low.Revision of changes in this part&#xD;
           of the study protocol should take into account any statistical effects, such as&#xD;
           adjustment of sample size due to changes in event rates, or revision of the analysis&#xD;
           plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Quality management (project supervision plan) :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific monitoring contents include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The verification scheme shall be submitted to the ethics committee for approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The researchers participating in this validation conscientiously followed the standard&#xD;
           operating procedures for clinical validation before, during and after the validation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. During the verification process, the researcher monitored the correctness and integrity&#xD;
           of the data in CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. According to the requirements of the case report form, researchers should faithfully,&#xD;
           carefully and carefully record all contents in CRF to ensure that the contents of the&#xD;
           case report form are true and reliable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. All observations and findings in clinical validation should be verified to ensure the&#xD;
           reliability of data, ensure that all conclusions in clinical validation are derived from&#xD;
           original data, and appropriate data management measures should be taken in clinical&#xD;
           validation and data processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Early Termination:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Define the principles and treatment for early termination of study, such as:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If serious adverse reactions occur in the trial, the clinical trial should be terminated in&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serious deviations were found in the implementation of clinical trials and it was difficult&#xD;
      to evaluate the efficacy of surgical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The applicant requests termination or the administration requests termination of the&#xD;
      experiment.&#xD;
