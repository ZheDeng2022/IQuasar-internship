  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to the limitations of current approaches to assess emergency paramedics' fatigue, a&#xD;
      portable, quick, easy, and objective technique is required to be developed. The aim of the&#xD;
      study was to investigate the reliability of automated pupillometry to assess mental fatigue&#xD;
      based on a driver simulator.&#xD;

    <description>The dynamic changes of pupillary light reflex were measured using the PLR-3000 pupillometer (NeurOptics, CA, USA), a hand-held portable device. Determination of pupillary light reflex with automated pupillometry can be performed with a rubber cup covering the measured eye and the subject's hand covering the non-measured eye. A flash of visible white light with a duration of 0.8 sec and a pulse intensity of 50 µW is delivered to induce a pupillary reflex, and repeated video images at more than 30 frames/sec are stored for 6.65 sec.</description>

    <description>After enrollments, subjects were assigned to perform mental fatigue-inducing experiment-a 90 min of monotonous simulated driving task. They underwent repeated measurements of quantitative pupillary light reflex (PLR) using an automated quantitative pupillometer at baseline and at an interval of 30 min during the task. Subjective ratings, heart rate variability (HRV), and electroencephalography (EEG) were performed simultaneously.</description>
