      Comparison incident of urinary retention in patients with vaginal surgery of pelvic organ&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vaginal surgery of pelvic organ prolapse needs to insert urinary catheter for monitoring&#xD;
      post-operative complication, hemodynamic status, and prevention post-operative urinary&#xD;
      retention. Urinary retention occur 2.4 - 43% after pelvic organ prolapse surgery, whereas&#xD;
      retaining urinary catheter is common cause of urinary tract infection, often&#xD;
      hospital-acquired infection. At Rajavithi hospital always remove urinary catheter at 48 hour&#xD;
      after surgery. Accordingly, appropriated time for removing urinary catheter in patients with&#xD;
      vaginal surgery of pelvic organ prolapse is unclear. This study aims to reduce timing for&#xD;
      removing urinary catheter after vaginal surgery, not increase urinary retention and&#xD;
      re-catheterization and reduce urinary tract infection and day of hospital stay.&#xD;
