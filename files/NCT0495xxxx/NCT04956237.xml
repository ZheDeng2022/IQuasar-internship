  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retinal surgeries are now performed in some hospitals with sub-Tenon anesthesia to replace&#xD;
      conventional peribulbar anesthesia. The advantages of performing the surgery with Tenonian&#xD;
      anesthesia can be: the cost reduced due to the non-intervention of an anesthesiologist, no&#xD;
      pre-operative anesthetic consultation, no waiting period for the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      peribulbar anesthesia (15-20min to have the effect of anesthesia of the eye). In addition,&#xD;
      there are more numerous and dangerous complications of peribulbar anesthesia than&#xD;
      sub-Tenonian anesthesia, however it allows the eye to remain stationary and to perform&#xD;
      precise surgery safely, as long as the patient does not move his head.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Performing a sub-Tenonian anesthesia also makes it possible to carry out surgeries more&#xD;
      quickly, this method having an immediate effect and being performed by the surgeon, without&#xD;
      the intervention of an anesthesiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The edema effect under the post / conjunctiva swells the area around the eye and allows&#xD;
      partial oculomotor limitation. Finally, for the patient, recovery is faster: no sedation or&#xD;
      venous route.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, however, no study has proven that the surgeon can safely operate on the patient&#xD;
      without increased complications compared to peribulbar anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to show that simple sub-Tenonian anesthesia in a short outpatient circuit&#xD;
      does not induce more pain or discomfort for the patient than a longer outpatient circuit with&#xD;
      bed and anesthesiologist. No studies have been performed on purely local anesthesia without a&#xD;
      venous route.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this, patients operated on at the Foch hospital without an anesthesiologist under&#xD;
      subtenon's anesthesia will be compared to patients operated on under peribulbar anesthesia&#xD;
      with an anesthesiologist at the Pierre Cherest clinic.&#xD;
