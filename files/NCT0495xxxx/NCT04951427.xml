      Rationale: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic relapsing-remitting autoimmune&#xD;
      disease with a wide range of clinical manifestations affecting several organs. Although the&#xD;
      management of lupus patients has improved in the last years, accurate models for predicting&#xD;
      disease progression are lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To prospectively evaluate the predictive value of a combination of chemokines,&#xD;
      MMPs/TIMPs, and autoantibody levels for predicting flares in patients with SLE Study design:&#xD;
      prospective, observational single centre cohort study, conducted at the department of&#xD;
      Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology of the UMC Utrecht Study population: Adult patients with&#xD;
      SLE (according to EULAR/ACR criteria) under control in the UMC Utrecht.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention (if applicable): n/a&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Profile of autoantibodies and chemokines in visits previous to recorded flares, compared&#xD;
           to visits previous to no recorded flares. Risk calculations will be made using areas&#xD;
           under the curve (AUC) for both individual markers as multivariate analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Changes in the profile of autoantibodies and chemokines in patients with lower reported&#xD;
           quality of life measured by LupusQoL questionnaire, compared to previous visits of the&#xD;
           same patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Changes in titer levels of autoantibodies before and after start of biological&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: this is an observational study; the burden for patients is esteemed to be low.&#xD;
      For some patients who regularly attend the outpatient clinic yearly, the four-times a year&#xD;
      visits during two years will be more frequent, including more frequent blood sampling,&#xD;
      compared to standard care. Furthermore, more blood will be drawn per sampling, compared to&#xD;
      standard care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic relapsing-remitting autoimmune disease with a&#xD;
      wide range of clinical manifestations affecting several organs. Although the management of&#xD;
      lupus patients has improved in the last years, accurate models for predicting disease&#xD;
      progression are lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In clinical practice, SLE patients can be categorized into three groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A large group of patients has 'quiescent' disease; after diagnosis of SLE and possibly a&#xD;
           short induction treatment with corticosteroids, patients remain in a state of remission&#xD;
           for years with hydroxychloroquine treatment only.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A substantial group of patients has relapsing-and-remitting disease, with mostly&#xD;
           cutaneous inflammation but without further organ involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A smaller group of patients has severe inflammation with extensive organ involvement,&#xD;
           including lupus nephritis and neuropsychiatric SLE (npSLE) as the most threatening&#xD;
           complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This stratification of patients is reflected by the frequency of hospital visits. Patients&#xD;
      with more severe disease activity have a higher frequency of visits to the outpatient clinic&#xD;
      and more frequently receive biologicals.(1) In the UMC Utrecht, patients in group 1. normally&#xD;
      visit the outpatient clinic on a yearly basis, patients in group 2. visit 2-4 times a year&#xD;
      and patients in group 3. are seen more frequently. However, some patients with quiescent&#xD;
      disease for years can still present with an SLE exacerbation, and patients with frequent&#xD;
      bouts of inflammation can eventually reach a remission state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It would be of great value to be able to distinguish these patient categories early after&#xD;
      diagnosis. This would aid the clinician in identifying those patients who can safely visit&#xD;
      the outpatient clinic only once a year, and conversely, it would be possible to point out&#xD;
      which patients should be monitored more closely. Ideally, this early distinction would also&#xD;
      correspond with treatment decisions, that is, intensifying treatment when a flare is&#xD;
      suspected, or tapering medication when there is a low risk profile. The ultimate goal would&#xD;
      be to enable clinicians to identify high risk patients and to treat them with&#xD;
      immunomodulating therapy before any inflammatory damage has occurred, for instance with the&#xD;
      combination of rituximab and belimumab as is being studied right now.(2,3) The pathogenesis&#xD;
      of SLE is highly complex. Genetic predispositions, proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines, autoantibodies, lymphocyte subset abnormalities as well as defects in the&#xD;
      complement systems all have putative roles in the development of SLE. At present, tools that&#xD;
      enable early patient stratification are lacking. Furthermore - except for a possible&#xD;
      association of rise in anti-dsDNA-antibodies and the development of lupus nephritis - factors&#xD;
      that can predict SLE flares have not been identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active disease has a large impact on the life of SLE patients, since it is known to result in&#xD;
      a lower health-related quality of life.(4) Fatigue is an important factor in patient reported&#xD;
      quality of life, but interestingly, disease activity is not associated with fatigue.(5) This&#xD;
      can lead to a discrepancy, where the clinician assesses the patient's disease activity to be&#xD;
      under control, where the patient is still experiencing a large burden of disease. Due to lack&#xD;
      of objective parameters correlating with patient reported outcomes, this discrepancy is&#xD;
      difficult to interpret for physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When considering factors that can be relevant for patient risk stratification, the role of&#xD;
      (novel) autoantibodies in the pathogenesis of SLE should not be overlooked. Several&#xD;
      autoantibodies have been shown to be of diagnostic value for SLE (anti-dsDNA, anti-SmD,&#xD;
      anti-Rib-P, anti-PCNA, anti-Chromatin, anti-complement (C1q)) and changes in the level of&#xD;
      autoantibodies can reflect disease activity.(6) However, dynamics of antibody levels on their&#xD;
      own are insufficient to be used as predictors of lupus activity in individual patients.&#xD;
      Moreover, some types of treatment, such as B-cell targeted therapy, are known to influence&#xD;
      the dynamics of antibody levels, making them harder to interpret.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some chemokines and matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) and their inhibitors (TIMPs) have been&#xD;
      shown to provide an indication of subclinical injury or inflammation in other inflammatory&#xD;
      diseases and in renal inflammation.(7-9) For example, urinary CXCL9 levels were found to be&#xD;
      associated with risk of acute rejection of renal transplants and a decline in renal&#xD;
      function.(10) In addition, serum levels of CXCL10 have been shown to correlate with lupus&#xD;
      activity in patients with SLE.(11) Furthermore, urinary levels of CXCL10 have shown very&#xD;
      promising results in the early detection of allograft rejection in kidney transplants.&#xD;
      Currently, an international randomized controlled trial is investigation if early treatment&#xD;
      of rejection, detected by urinary CXCL10, will improve outcomes. (12) As of yet, these&#xD;
      urinary markers have not been studied in the context of SLE and lupus nephritis. Dynamic&#xD;
      levels of these urine markers and the relation to their corresponding serum levels could&#xD;
      serve as early indicators of nephritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study will be to prospectively evaluate the predictive value of&#xD;
      a combination of chemokines, MMPs/TIMPs, and autoantibody levels for predicting flares in&#xD;
      patients with SLE. This approach allows identification of the markers with the best&#xD;
      predictive value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a secondary objective, this study will investigate whether dynamic changes in&#xD;
      autoantibody- and chemokine levels differ between patients treated with or without&#xD;
      anti-B-cell therapy (for instance, with rituximab or belimumab). In patients treated with&#xD;
      anti-B-cell therapy lower autoantibody levels are observed, which could influence the&#xD;
      combination of markers being studied. Until now, it is unclear whether the degree of lowering&#xD;
      autoantibody levels after treatment is correlated with treatment efficacy and whether changes&#xD;
      in autoantibody levels in SLE patients treated with anti-B-cell therapy can be indicative of&#xD;
      lupus flares. This study will give insight into this relationship.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relationship of these biomarkers with patient reported quality of life and fatigue will&#xD;
      be assessed. These markers might provide the physicians extra tools on how to interpret the&#xD;
      discrepancy between objective measurements by the physician and patient reported outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in the department of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology in the&#xD;
      UMC Utrecht, a tertiary care center with approximately 400 patients with SLE in care. This&#xD;
      department is very experienced and successful in conducting large clinical and translational&#xD;
      trials in the field of autoimmunity.(13-18) Together with two other Dutch academic hospitals,&#xD;
      the Dutch SLE registry was founded, including not only all patients who are treated with&#xD;
      belimumab, but at present almost 1000 Dutch SLE patients who are being followed clinically at&#xD;
      least once a year. The department actively takes part in the current multi-center&#xD;
      international BLISS-BELIVE study.(2) The proposed number of patients to be included in this&#xD;
      study is 100, making it a large prospective cohort study in SLE related research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main hypothesis: A combination of levels of autoantibodies and chemokines can be used to&#xD;
      predict flares in SLE patients.&#xD;
