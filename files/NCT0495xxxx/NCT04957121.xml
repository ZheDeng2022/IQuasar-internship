  <detailed_description>

      The patients undergoing hip surgery between were divided into the on-hours group or the&#xD;
      off-hours group depending on the begin time of anesthesia in this retrospective cohort study.&#xD;
      In-hospital mortality and early prognosis were compared between the two groups.&#xD;
