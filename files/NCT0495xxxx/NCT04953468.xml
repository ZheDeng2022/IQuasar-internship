  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prognostic value of ANXA2 expression in tumor tissue and PTBE was analyzed, so as to seek&#xD;
      new therapies to inhibit glioma invasion and improve the prognosis of glioma patients&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main reason for the poor prognosis of glioma is the invasion of tumor cells along the&#xD;
      extracellular space (ECS) in the periatumoral edema zone (PTBE).Previous studies have shown&#xD;
      that ANXA2 is highly expressed in glioma and promotes tumor growth and invasion, while its&#xD;
      expression in the PTBE microenvironment of glioma and its mechanism of action on tumor&#xD;
      invasion have not been reported.Previous study found that ANXA2 was overexpressed in gliomas&#xD;
      and was associated with poor prognosis, and the low expression of ANXA2 significantly&#xD;
      inhibited tumor invasion in vitro.Relevant studies have also confirmed that as an exocrine&#xD;
      protein, it mainly plays a role in ECS, and it has previously been carried out on the tissue&#xD;
      structure of ECS in tumor microenvironment.Therefore, investigators planned to study the&#xD;
      mechanism of ANXA2 expression in PTBE microenvironment ECS on tumor invasion.This project&#xD;
      aims to take glioma related issues as the research object and analyze tumor tissue and tumor&#xD;
      tissue&#xD;

    <description>We plan to grade the dyeing intensity of ANXA2 as follows: level 0 for non-stained, level 1 for lighter colored, level 3 for dark brown, and level 2 for those between the latter two.We planned to divide the staining proportion into 5 grades: grade 0 for those without staining, grade 1 for those with staining proportion &lt; 10%, grade 2 for those with staining proportion ≥10% and &lt; 50%, grade 3 for those with staining proportion ≥50% and &lt; 80%, and grade 4 for those with staining proportion ≥ 80%.Finally, staining intensity grading × staining proportion grading = expression level was calculated In glioma tissues, samples with expression level ≥6 points were identified as the ANXA2 high expression group</description>
