  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has demonstrated diagnostic and therapeutic&#xD;
      potential for a number of conditions and is an approved treatment for depression.&#xD;
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) has a significant impact on mental health, and comorbid&#xD;
      maladaptive behaviors and pain are highly prevalent in patients with IBD and are often&#xD;
      under-treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators predict TMS will improve comorbid maladaptive behavior (heightened&#xD;
      interoceptive awareness, sleep, fatigue, catastrophizing, anxiety and depression), reduce&#xD;
      pain and improve quality of life in persons with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Further,&#xD;
      TMS benefits will be associated with changes in gut microbiome as measured by stool, blood&#xD;
      and urine samples and normalization of IBD-associated changes in brain structure and/or&#xD;
      function as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background and rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comorbid maladaptive behaviors and pain are highly prevalent in patients with IBD and are&#xD;
      often under-treated. These comorbidities lack effective therapies and thus complicate medical&#xD;
      management, adversely impact patient outcome and health, and increase the resource burden on&#xD;
      the healthcare system. Development of effective treatment delivery is therefore vital.&#xD;
      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive form of brain&#xD;
      stimulation in which an electric pulse generator placed at the scalp produces a rapidly&#xD;
      changing magnetic field at biologically relevant frequencies to induce a stimulating&#xD;
      electrical current at targeted sites in the brain. rTMS has demonstrated diagnostic and&#xD;
      therapeutic potential for a number of conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, autism,&#xD;
      bipolar disorder, epilepsy, chronic pain, major depressive disorder, Parkinson's disease,&#xD;
      post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), schizophrenia (negative symptoms),&#xD;
      obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and for the cessation of smoking. To date, however, rTMS&#xD;
      has not been used to treat the mental health issues and symptoms observed in persons with&#xD;
      IBD. The investigators will develop rTMS interventions for IBD to target comorbid maladaptive&#xD;
      behaviors and pain using evidence-based knowledge of TMS effectiveness for other chronic&#xD;
      medical conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared to sham, does twice daily intermittent theta-burst stimulation rTMS delivered to the&#xD;
      left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for two weeks (20 sessions) improve comorbid maladaptive&#xD;
      behavior (heightened interoceptive awareness, sleep, fatigue, catastrophizing, anxiety and&#xD;
      depression), reduce pain and improve quality of life in persons with inflammatory bowel&#xD;
      disease (IBD)? Further, will TMS benefits be associated with changes in gut microbiome and&#xD;
      normalization of IBD-associated changes in brain structure and/or function as measured by&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty male and female IBD (Chron's Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC)) patients with&#xD;
      co-morbid anxiety and depression will be recruited for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized 1:1 to TMS or sham TMS according to a computer-generated&#xD;
      randomization list from eligible patients identified from the cohort study. Randomization&#xD;
      will be stratified by type of IBD (UC versus CD). Patients will be randomized 1:1 to 2 weeks&#xD;
      of twice-daily active or sham TMS. The investigators will utilize intermittent theta-burst&#xD;
      stimulation (iTBS 600 pulses per session delivered as triplets at 50Hz repeated at 5Hz at 80%&#xD;
      resting motor threshold) delivered to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) using a&#xD;
      MagPro X100 stimulator and a COOL-B70 (active) or MCF-P-B70 (placebo) coil. Participants will&#xD;
      receive 20 treatments over two weeks. All participants allocated to the double-blind phase&#xD;
      will be offered 2 weeks of open-label twice-daily iTBS to the left DLPFC if they do not&#xD;
      achieve 50% reduction in QIDS-SR score during the double-blind phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline characterization will include demographic information, self-reported measures of&#xD;
      comorbid maladaptive behaviors and pain, neurocognitive tests, analysis of IBD symptoms,&#xD;
      microbiome analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo an MRI of the brain prior to receiving treatment for localization&#xD;
      of the DLPFC, as well as characterization of volumetric imaging, white matter imaging,&#xD;
      resting state activity and inflammation imaging. A second MRI will be repeated characterizing&#xD;
      these same parameters after the conclusion of the sham-controlled treatment (week 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stool, blood and urine samples will be collected at baseline, after the conclusion of the&#xD;
      sham-controlled treatment (week 2) and 4 weeks follow up (week 6). These will be used for&#xD;
      assessment of fecal calprotectin, fecal bacterial and fungal microbiome, inflammatory markers&#xD;
      and metabolomic analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brief, computerized neurocognitive tests will be administered at baseline, after TMS&#xD;
      treatment (week 2) and 4 week follow up (week 6)&#xD;

All samples will be amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in triplicate using 37-nucleotide barcoded primer pairs flanking the V4 region of the 16S gene and the ITS2 gene. Pooled PCR amplicons will be sequenced across the hyper-variable regions. Sequences will be pre-processed, denoised, and quality filtered by size using DADA229. Representative sequences will be clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and classified against the Greengenes Database30 according to 97% similarity.&#xD;

    <description>rTMS is a non-invasive procedure in which cerebral electrical activity is influenced by a rapidly changing magnetic field. The magnetic field is created by a plastic-encased coil which is placed over the patient's scalp. The magnetic field can be directed onto specific areas of the brain. rTMS can modulate cerebral activity by low or high frequencies. Over time, the magnetic field pulses can gradually change the activity level of the stimulated brain region and help symptoms of depression and anxiety.</description>
