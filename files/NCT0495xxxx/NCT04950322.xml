    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, Double-Blind, multi-center Phase III clinical study, aimed to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of SHR1701 combined with chemotherapy in the treatment of&#xD;
      Previously Untreated, Advanced or Metastatic Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer. For&#xD;
      Part 1 study，the tolerability of SHR-1701 will be evaluated and determine the recommended&#xD;
      dose for Part 2.For Part 2 study, all enrolled patients will be randomized to 2 groups and&#xD;
      continuously treated until the end criteria of treatment was met.&#xD;
