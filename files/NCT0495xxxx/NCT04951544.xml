  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Pilot Test (AKA Study B) will entail a pilot randomized, controlled trial (RCT) of an&#xD;
      mHealth behavioral intervention, LetSync, with 80 couples (N=160) to assess its&#xD;
      acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary impact on retention in care and ART adherence as&#xD;
      measured by antiretroviral concentrations in hair. Participants in the intervention arm will&#xD;
      use LetSync v1.0 for 6 months and provide acceptability and feasibility data. In the ensuing&#xD;
      2 months, the investigators will make refinements based on participants' data to produce&#xD;
      LetSync v2.0. Then, participants in the waitlist-control arm will receive LetSync v2.0, use&#xD;
      it for 6 months, and provide acceptability and feasibility data. The intervention arm will&#xD;
      continue using LetSync v1.0, for a total of 14 months. Based on acceptability and feasibility&#xD;
      data from waitlist control arm participants between T3 and T4, the investigators will develop&#xD;
      LetSync v3.0, which will be used for efficacy testing in a full RCT trial in the future.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Levels of Antiretroviral (ARV) concentration in small scalp hair samples</measure>
    <time_frame>14 months</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will use the UCSF Hair Analysis Laboratory to analyze ARV levels in small hair samples as an objective measure of drug adherence and exposure for HIV-infected participants. The investigators will mail participants a hair sample collection kit with necessary supplies, detailed instructions via online demonstration video, and a prepaid return envelope. Hair samples will be collected and analyzed between baseline (T1) and 14 months (T4).&#xD;
ARV levels will be measured as nanograms per milligram (ng/mg) of hair will be log-transformed for data analysis. Changes since Baseline of ARV levels will be measured.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-reported measure of care engagement</measure>
    <time_frame>14 months</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported care engagement will be measured with the 10-item Index of Engagement in HIV Care rated on a Likert-type scale ranging from 1 to 5, 'Strongly disagree' to 'Strongly agree'. This will be included in questionnaires administered to participants between baseline (T1) and 14 months (T4).&#xD;
A mean Index score will be calculated (the sum of all items without missing responses divided by that number of items), with a higher score representing better care engagement and lower score representing worse care engagement. Changes since Baseline of the mean Index score will be measured.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-reported measure I of antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>14 months</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence will be measured using an aggregated or composite score derived from the following items. Frequency of missed doses will be represented by summing the following two items: how many doses were missed over the last 30 days, and how many doses missed over the past three months for at least four days in a row.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-reported measure II of antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>14 months</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence will be measured using an aggregated or composite score derived from the following items on a Likert-type scale of 1 to 5, 'Strongly disagree' to 'Strongly agree': Self-rated ability of taking medications the way they should, how often they took medications the way they should.&#xD;
For self-rated ability of taking medications and frequency of taking them, a mean score will be calculated (the sum of all items without missing responses divided by that number of items). A higher score represents excellent ability of taking medications and a lower score represents poor ability of taking medications. Changes in Baseline for the mean Index score will be measured.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility or usability of LetSync app v1.0 (how easy or convenient is v1.0 to use)</measure>
    <time_frame>14 months</time_frame>
    <description>Between baseline (T1) and 14 months (T4), the investigators will collect feasibility-related data via the app using a validated 10-item Feasibility instrument. The items are on a five-point Likert scale ranging from 'Strongly disagree' to 'Strongly agree'. A mean Feasibility score will be calculated (the sum of all items without missing responses divided by that number of items). A higher score indicates high feasibility, whereas a lower score indicates low feasibility.&#xD;
Feasibility data collected only between baseline (T1) and 6 months (T2) will be used to develop LetSync app v2.0 for the Waitlist-control arm. Investigators will continue collecting acceptability data on LetSync app v1.0 from the Intervention arm.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptability of or Satisfaction in using LetSync app v1.0</measure>
    <time_frame>14 months</time_frame>
    <description>Between baseline (T1) and 14 months (T4), the investigators will collect acceptability data via the app using a validated 5-item Feasibility instrument. The items are on a five-point Likert scale (1 to 5) ranging from 'Strongly disagree' to 'Strongly agree'. A mean Acceptability score will be calculated (the sum of all items without missing responses divided by that number of items). A higher score indicates high acceptability, whereas a lower score indicates low feasibility.&#xD;
Acceptability data collected only between baseline (T1) and 6 months (T2) will be used to develop LetSync app v2.0 for the Waitlist-control arm. Investigators will continue collecting acceptability data on LetSync app v1.0 from the Intervention arm.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility of LetSync app v2.0 (how easy or convenient is v2.0 to use)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will collect feasibility data via the app using a validated 10-item Feasibility instrument. The items are on a five-point Likert scale ranging from 'Strongly disagree' to 'Strongly agree'. A mean Feasibility score will be calculated (the sum of all items without missing responses divided by that number of items). A higher score indicates high feasibility, whereas a lower score indicates low feasibility.&#xD;
Feasibility data will be collected from the Waitlist-control arm between 8 months (T3) and 14 months (T4) for a total of six months.</description>

    <description>The investigators will collect data on participants' self-reported care engagement; this will be comprised of scheduled, cancelled, rescheduled, and attended visits to their HIV and/or primary care provider within the last three to six months. Data will be collected via questionnaires administered to participants between baseline (T1) and 14 months (T4). The investigators will measure changes from Baseline for each item of interest.</description>
