    <textblock>
      Despite large-scale, nationwide efforts to better address suicidal behavior in Veterans at&#xD;
      high risk, the development of interventions that target some of the key risk factors&#xD;
      associated with suicide remains limited. This study aims to collect pilot data to test&#xD;
      feasibility/acceptability of a novel adjunctive evidence-based cognitive remediation (CR)&#xD;
      therapy with manualized &quot;Bridging&quot; sessions for transfer and practice of problem-solving&#xD;
      strategies for real-world stressors, including those that trigger suicidal thoughts. This&#xD;
      10-week (20 session) Neuropsychological Educational Approach to Cognitive Remediation&#xD;
      CR+Bridging telehealth intervention will be administered virtually via HIPPA-compliant&#xD;
      services to 36 Veterans with major depressive disorder and a history of suicide attempt(s).&#xD;
      Pre-, post-treatment, and follow-up assessments of neurocognitive, clinical, social, and&#xD;
      real-world functioning also will be conducted. This study has potential for high public&#xD;
      health impact and promise to help improve quality of life for Veterans at high risk for&#xD;
      suicide.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite large-scale, nationwide efforts to better address suicidal behavior (defined as&#xD;
      thoughts and behavior) in high-risk Veterans with major depressive disorder (MDD), the&#xD;
      development of interventions that target some of the key risk factors associated with suicide&#xD;
      in Veterans with MDD remains limited. That is, while much intervention research continues to&#xD;
      investigate treatments like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) that target behavioral&#xD;
      patterns, emotion processing problems, and cognitive styles associated with suicide risk in&#xD;
      MDD, deficits in the neurocognitive substrates that underlie these CBT targets remain&#xD;
      under-addressed. Cognitive remediation (CR) and rehabilitation have long been a primary&#xD;
      treatment for patients with other psychiatric illnesses, like schizophrenia, for improving&#xD;
      cognitive functioning and facilitating transfer of cognitive skills to every-day functioning.&#xD;
      However, scant work has examined CR that addresses the neurocognitive deficits underlying&#xD;
      suicidal behavior in individuals with MDD. Empirical work has identified key executive&#xD;
      functioning (EF) deficits that may be specific to MDD patients with suicidal behavior, and&#xD;
      meta-analytic work indicates that CR has moderate effect sizes on cognitive functioning,&#xD;
      depression, and daily functioning in MDD. Thus, the field is in dire need of work that&#xD;
      examines CR as a recovery-oriented treatment approach for MDD patients at risk for suicide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study aims to collect pilot data to test the feasibility and acceptability of&#xD;
      adjunctive neuroplasticity-based CR on key treatment targets delivered via telehealth during&#xD;
      this time of COVID-19 in a sample of 36 Veterans with MDD and a history of suicide&#xD;
      attempt(s). Specifically, it will test the effects of an adjunctive evidence-based cognitive&#xD;
      remediation (CR) therapy (adjunctive to treatment as usual) augmented with manualized&#xD;
      &quot;Bridging&quot; sessions on transfer and practice of cognitive control and&#xD;
      decision-making/problem-solving strategies for real-world situations and problems, including&#xD;
      those that trigger suicidal thoughts. The investigators propose to administer the&#xD;
      Neuropsychological Educational Approach to Cognitive Remediation (NEAR, termed CR plus&#xD;
      &quot;Bridging&quot; session, CR+Bridging) to a total of 36 Veterans with MDD and a history of suicide&#xD;
      attempt(s). The intervention will be delivered in 20 90-minute sessions (2x/week for 10&#xD;
      weeks). Pre-treatment assessments of neurocognitive, clinical, social, and real-world&#xD;
      functioning will be conducted, including measures that examine the impact of COVID-19 and its&#xD;
      accompanying &quot;social-distancing&quot; restrictions. Posttreatment assessments of the same targets&#xD;
      will be conducted to determine clinical response to and feasibility of this therapeutic&#xD;
      intervention immediately following conclusion of the intervention (Week 10) and at a&#xD;
      follow-up assessment (Week 20). This application is novel in that it constitutes the first&#xD;
      implementation of this intervention in Veterans with MDD and suicidal behavior. Consistent&#xD;
      with RR&amp;D's SPiRE mechanism, this study is high risk, but it has high potential impact and&#xD;
      promise to help improve quality of life for Veterans at high risk for suicide.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Score: pre- minus post-treatment intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in Pre-treatment Score minus Post-treatment Score (Week 10)</time_frame>
    <description>The research team will use the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) to examine depression symptoms. A higher MADRS score indicates more severe depression and the overall score ranges from 0 to 60. There are 10 items and each item yields a score of 0 to 6. These 10 sub-items are added together for the total score.&#xD;
Typical cutoff points for the total MADRS score are:&#xD;
0 to 6 - normal/symptom absent 7 to 19 - mild depression 20-34 - moderate depression &gt;34 - severe depression Note: We will examine the change in MADRS score from pre-treatment to post-treatment intervention. A positive change score means improvement in depression severity from pre- to post-treatment. We hypothesize that there will be positive change scores following this treatment intervention.</description>
