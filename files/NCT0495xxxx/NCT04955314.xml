  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the importance of manual therapy specificity in&#xD;
      relation to subacute low back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to do this, it will be selected a sample of at least 48 people who suffer low back&#xD;
      pain whose duration has not exceeded 12 weeks. Patients will be divided into two groups and a&#xD;
      different physiotherapist from the one who will subsequently perform the intervention, will&#xD;
      assess and determine which is the most painful segment in each of them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first group, the intervention to be carried out will be through posteroanterior (PA)&#xD;
      vertebral mobilizations in the most painful lumbar segment. The members of the second group&#xD;
      will undergo this same technique on a painful segment of the region adjacent to the one they&#xD;
      have referred as the main source of pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each of these sessions will continue until the patient's symptoms have decreased two points&#xD;
      on the numerical scale of pain. There will be one session per week, for six weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the differences between the two groups, there will be carried out 4 measurements&#xD;
      of pain, functional disability, quality of life and kinesiophobia, and 3 measurements of&#xD;
      pressure pain threshold were performed. Each one of them will be carried out in the first&#xD;
      session, in the third week of treatment, in the last session of the treatment and one month&#xD;
      after the end of the treatment. The last measeurement will be executed online and that is why&#xD;
      the pressure pain threshold will be measured three times while the rest will be do it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that it won´t be differences in the amount of pain between the tratment on&#xD;
      the main painful segment and the treatment on his adyacent segment.&#xD;

    <description>Using Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS). In this scale patients rate their pain on an eleven-point numerical scale. The scale is composed of 0 (no pain at all) to 10 (worst imaginable pain)</description>

    <measure>Change in Health related quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 weeks, 6 weeks and 10 weeks after intervention beginning.</time_frame>
    <description>Using SF-36.This scale is made up of 36 items divided into 8 sections. The result can range from 0 to 100, where 0 is the worst possible health condition and 100 is the best one.</description>

    <measure>Change in Kinesiophobia</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 weeks, 6 weeks and 10 weeks after intervention beginning.</time_frame>
    <description>Using the tampa scale for kinesiophobia-11 (TSK-11) to measure fear of movement, pain and injury relapse. The result can range from 11-44 points where higher scores indicate greater fear of pain, movement, and injury.</description>

    <measure>Change in Disability</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 weeks, 6 weeks and 10 weeks after intervention beginning.</time_frame>
    <description>Using Oswestry Disability Index (ODI).The final score of this scale ranges from 0-100. A score of 0-20 reflects minimal disability, 21-40 moderate disability, 41-60 severe disability, 61-80 crippled, and 81-100 bed-bound</description>
