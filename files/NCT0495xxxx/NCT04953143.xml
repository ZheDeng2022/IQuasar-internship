  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Frequently patients with advanced liver disease experience physical and emotional symptoms&#xD;
      during their hospitalization that can may cause a level of discomfort to both the patient and&#xD;
      the family members that surround them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study involves the early introduction of a team of clinicians that specialize in the&#xD;
      lessening (palliation) of many of these discomforting symptoms. This team of clinicians is&#xD;
      called the palliative care team and they focus on ways to improve pain and other symptom&#xD;
      management and to assist patients and their families in coping with the physical, emotional&#xD;
      and social issues associated with a diagnosis of advanced liver disease. The team consists of&#xD;
      physicians and advance practice nurses who have been specially trained in the care of&#xD;
      patients facing serious illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are studying the feasibility of delivering this program, the acceptability&#xD;
      and satisfaction with the program, and changes in the quality of life and symptoms of&#xD;
      hospitalized patients who receive the program. The study will use a series of questionnaires&#xD;
      and qualitative interviews to measure the study participants' quality of life, physical&#xD;
      symptoms, illness and prognostic understanding, and mood. Study questionnaires will be&#xD;
      completed in the hospital, home or clinic. Qualitative interviews will be conducted with&#xD;
      hepatology and palliative care clinicians.&#xD;

    <description>The investigators will conduct qualitative interviews with the patients enrolled in the open pilot phase as well as LiverPal clinicians to elicit stakeholder feedback on the intervention. The qualitative component of the exit interviews will explore 1) patients' and clinicians' perceptions of the acceptability and content of LiverPal; 2) any barriers or challenges to providing or receiving LiverPal; and 3) suggested modifications to LiverPal to improve its delivery in the inpatient setting</description>
