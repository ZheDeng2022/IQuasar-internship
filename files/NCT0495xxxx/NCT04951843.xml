      The present project is to identify the effect of black soy beans Koji product supplementation&#xD;
      on nutrients absorption and anti-aging effect in elderly.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies show that supplementation of soy protein can effectively increase muscle&#xD;
      mass and protein utilization. Besides, soy extracts and isoflavones can stimulate muscle&#xD;
      growth by activating the anabolic pathway of muscle tubules. Black soybean is known to be&#xD;
      rich in legume protein and isoflavones.We speculate that black soybean supplementation can&#xD;
      improve the nutritional status and muscle mass of elderly people, thereby delaying the&#xD;
      deterioration of muscular dystrophy in the elderly. Reduce the occurrence of debilitation in&#xD;
      the elderly.&#xD;

    <description>Total genome DNA from samples was extracted from stool samples using the CTAB/SDS method. One hundred ng of DNA was amplified with barcoded primers16S V3+V4: 314F-806R annealing to the V3-V4region of the 16S rRNA. All of the PCR reactions were carried out using a Phusion® High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix (New England Biolabs, Location). Samples with a bright main strip between 400 and 450bp were selected from 2% agarose gel for further experiments. Mixture PCR products were purified using a Qiagen Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Germany). Libraries were generated with the TruSeq® DNA PCR-Free Sample Preparation Kit and quantified with Qubit and Q-PCR. The purified DNA was then sequenced using the HiSeq2500 PE250 (Company, Location).</description>
