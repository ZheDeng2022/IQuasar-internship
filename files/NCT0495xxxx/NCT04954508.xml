      We developed a new test, the &quot;hug-up test,&quot; wherein elevation is resisted as the palm is held&#xD;
      on the opposite shoulder with the elbow held in maximal anterior translation. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study was to describe the hug-up test and compare it with other conventional tests used&#xD;
      for diagnosing supraspinatus tears.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The supraspinatus tendon is the most commonly affected tendon in rotator cuff tears. Early&#xD;
      detection of a supraspinatus tear using an accurate physical examination is, therefore,&#xD;
      important. However, the currently used physical tests for detecting supraspinatus tears are&#xD;
      poor diagnostic indicators and involve a wide range of sensitivity and specificity values.&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim of this study was to establish a new physical test for the diagnosis of&#xD;
      supraspinatus tears and evaluate its accuracy in comparison with conventional tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between November 2012 and January 2014, 200 consecutive patients undergoing shoulder&#xD;
      arthroscopy were prospectively evaluated preoperatively. The hug-up test, empty can (EC)&#xD;
      test, full can (FC) test, Neer impingement sign, and Hawkins-Kennedy impingement sign were&#xD;
      used and compared statistically for their accuracy in terms of supraspinatus tears, with&#xD;
      arthroscopic findings as the gold standard. Muscle strength was precisely quantified using an&#xD;
      electronic digital tensiometer.&#xD;
