  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain and unhealthy drinking are common co-occurring conditions among patients&#xD;
      presenting to primary care. Given their impact on functioning and medical outcomes, there&#xD;
      would be considerable benefit to developing an accessible, easily utilized, integrative&#xD;
      approach to reduce unhealthy alcohol use and pain that can be readily incorporated into the&#xD;
      primary care setting. The objective of this study is to test a smartphone-based intervention&#xD;
      for reducing unhealthy alcohol use and pain in primary care patients, determine the&#xD;
      feasibility of implementing this intervention in the primary care setting, provide effect&#xD;
      size estimates of the intervention on drinking and chronic pain outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heavy alcohol use represents a significant risk for morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately,&#xD;
      addressing unhealthy patterns of alcohol use in primary care is often a challenge as patients&#xD;
      typically present with co-morbid conditions that: (1) may make unhealthy drinking a lower&#xD;
      priority health issue and (2) may impact the capacity for sustained alcohol-related change.&#xD;
      Chronic pain is among the most common of these conditions among primary care patients. Pain&#xD;
      is a frequent source of distress and disability among primary care patients and is one of the&#xD;
      most frequent causes for visits. Pain is also an important trigger for alcohol use among&#xD;
      primary care patients who drink and is associated with the experience of negative&#xD;
      alcohol-related consequences and unhealthy drinking over time. The experience of pain has&#xD;
      also been shown to be associated with poorer responses to alcohol interventions. Primary care&#xD;
      physicians face a number of challenges when attempting to treat co-occurring unhealthy&#xD;
      drinking and pain among their patients. Pain management and reduction of alcohol use among&#xD;
      those who engage in heavy alcohol use is often not adequately achieved with pharmacological&#xD;
      treatments nor are pharmacological treatments indicated for common pain conditions. Moreover,&#xD;
      despite the availability of evidence-based psychosocial interventions for unhealthy drinking&#xD;
      and chronic pain, patients with each of these conditions typically show poor adherence to&#xD;
      treatment. Given the rates of pain and unhealthy alcohol use among primary care patients and&#xD;
      their impact on functioning and medical outcomes, there would be considerable benefit to an&#xD;
      accessible, easily utilized, integrative approach to treat heavy alcohol use and pain that&#xD;
      can be readily incorporated into the primary care setting. The objectives of this study are&#xD;
      to develop a smartphone-based intervention for reducing heavy alcohol use and pain in primary&#xD;
      care patients, determine the feasibility of implementing this intervention in the primary&#xD;
      care setting, provide effect size estimates of the intervention on outcomes, and develop&#xD;
      procedures to conduct a Stage II efficacy trial.&#xD;
