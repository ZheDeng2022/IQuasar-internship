      Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate whether ULDCT with ASiR-V can be used&#xD;
      for the detection and diameter measurement of pulmonary nodules at an extremely low dose&#xD;
      comparable to those associated with plain-film chest radiography. Furthermore, mixed-effects&#xD;
      logistic regression analysis was used to determine independent predictors for the sensitivity&#xD;
      of pulmonary nodule detection to explore the application range of ULDCT in Chinese patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the most common cancer in the world and characterized by the highest mortality&#xD;
      rate. In 2016, 224000 new cases of lung cancer were reported in the United States, 60% of&#xD;
      which were in the advanced stage. Compared to the overall 5-year survival rate of 18% for&#xD;
      lung cancer, the 5-year survival rate for non-small cell lung cancer can be obviously&#xD;
      improved to 80% with appropriate treatment in the early stage. Therefore, we believe lung&#xD;
      cancer screening in the early stage to be significant. The National Lung Screening Trial in&#xD;
      the United States has shown a relative risk reduction in death from lung cancer by 20% with&#xD;
      low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening compared to that associated with plain-film&#xD;
      chest radiography. The maximum radiation dose of LDCT recommended by guidelines is 3 mSv for&#xD;
      small people(BMI≤30 kg/m2), which is far higher than that recommended for plain-film chest&#xD;
      radiography, 0.03 to 0.1 mSv. In addition, a large number of indeterminate nodules need to be&#xD;
      examined by follow-up evaluations with repeated LDCT to monitor for changes in diameter,&#xD;
      which could result in an increase in the cumulative radiation dose that cannot be ignored.&#xD;
      Hence, lung cancer screening with ultralow-dose CT (ULDCT) has attracted great attention from&#xD;
      radiologists. In recent times, several strategies have been proposed to reduce the dose of&#xD;
      ionizing radiation, including modification of tube potential and tube current and use of&#xD;
      iterative reconstruction (IR). Reducing tube potential and tube current alone impairs image&#xD;
      quality and lowers accuracies for radiologists. However, IR can obviously improve the image&#xD;
      quality and reduce the noise at the same radiation exposure level, allowing for further&#xD;
      reduction of the radiation dose.Recently, a new IR technique adaptive statistical iterative&#xD;
      reconstruction-V (ASiR-V, GE Healthcare, USA) was developed. ASiR-V can increase noise&#xD;
      reduction performance over the original IR technique even at lower doses and it has been&#xD;
      widely applied in phantom and clinical studies. To the best of our knowledge, no data are&#xD;
      available on ULDCT with ASiR-V for research on pulmonary nodules. Therefore, the purpose of&#xD;
      this study was to investigate whether ULDCT with ASiR-V can be used for the detection and&#xD;
      diameter measurement of pulmonary nodules at an extremely low dose comparable to those&#xD;
      associated with plain-film chest radiography. Furthermore, mixed-effects logistic regression&#xD;
      analysis was used to determine independent predictors for the sensitivity of pulmonary nodule&#xD;
      detection to explore the application range of ULDCT in Chinese patients.&#xD;
