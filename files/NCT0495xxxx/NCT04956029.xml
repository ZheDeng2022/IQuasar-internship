      This study aims to compare correlation between outcome and performance observations and&#xD;
      effectiveness by using aerobic colony counts as a comparator in order to find out which&#xD;
      method would be better to be used to assess hospital cleanliness.&#xD;

      Design and Setting We perform a prospective study which is conducted in a 17-bed adult&#xD;
      medical intensive care unit with approximately 352 annually admissions at a tertiary hospital&#xD;
      in Taiwan from July 2021 to December 2022. Cleaning performance observation will be performed&#xD;
      according to the environmental checklist for monitoring terminal cleaning released by Centers&#xD;
      for Disease Control and Prevention in 2014, to select sampling areas of high-touch surfaces&#xD;
      in patient rooms, including bed controls, bed rails, cart pulls, light switches, machine&#xD;
      controls, tray tables and call buttons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection The housekeepers start to do terminal cleaning after patients are transferred&#xD;
      or discharged, the researcher also starts to observe directly the practices of cleaning at&#xD;
      the same time and recorded &quot;compliant&quot; or &quot;not compliant&quot; whenever surfaces are cleaned and&#xD;
      disinfected properly or on the contrary. The high-touch surfaces are disinfected with&#xD;
      solution which contained Sodium dichloroisocyanurate (NaDCC). Right after the surfaces are&#xD;
      cleaned, the researcher inspect the surfaces and record &quot;clean&quot; or &quot;not clean&quot; whenever&#xD;
      surfaces are free of dust, debris, and stains immediately after terminal cleaning or on the&#xD;
      contrary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten minutes after surfaces are cleaned and disinfected, Hygiena Ultrasnap Surface ATP test&#xD;
      will be applied to swab a standard 10*10 cm area on selected surfaces by samping templet.&#xD;
      After completing sampling, swabs are replaced back in swab tube and all liquid in bulbs was&#xD;
      expelled to activate the reaction. Once activated, samples were read right after shaking swab&#xD;
      tube for 5-10 seconds. The ATP readings less than 10 RLU (relative light unit, RLU) are&#xD;
      interpreted as &quot;pass&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The designated cleaner and the researcher will be assigned to clean high-touch room surfaces&#xD;
      and to be in charge of evaluating and sampling, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Descriptive statistics are calculated including numbers, percentage,&#xD;
      mean and standard deviation. Inferential statistics are analyzed with SPSS (version 22) to&#xD;
      determine correlation between results of performance observation, Visual inspection and ATP&#xD;
      interpretation by using Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. The phi coefficient are&#xD;
      calculated to measure strength between two sets of data. The phi coefficient refers to the&#xD;
      meaning of Pearson's Correlation coefficients, values 0.01-0.19 as no or negligible, 0.2-0.39&#xD;
      as weak positive, 0.4-0.69 as medium positive, 0.7-1.0 as strong positive.12 The ATP readings&#xD;
      were compared between &quot;not compliant&quot; and &quot;compliant&quot;, and between &quot;not clean&quot; and &quot;clean&quot;&#xD;
      respectively by using Mann-Whitney U test.&#xD;
