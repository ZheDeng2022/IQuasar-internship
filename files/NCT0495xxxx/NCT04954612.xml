  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During COVID-19 pandemic, in the lockdown period, reduced physical activity and obesity were&#xD;
      reported in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Turkey, face to face education was ceased after March 16, till the end of the previous&#xD;
      academic year and education was tried to be substituted remotely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A temporary lockdown was implemented for children and young people under the age of 20,&#xD;
      between April 3 and June 5 2020. At 45 days following the lockdown of children, 72% of the&#xD;
      parents with children aged 6-13 years stated that their screen time had increased to a mean&#xD;
      of 6.4 hours per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Engaging more time in physical activity, and less in sedentary and leisure screen time was&#xD;
      found to be associated with less anxiety during pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before 2020-2021 academic year, government and educators increased their preparedness for the&#xD;
      second and third waves and improved the technological infrastructure. Depending on grades,&#xD;
      preferences of the family, primary education continued remotely between November 2020 and&#xD;
      July 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate whether musculoskeletal complaints are increased in&#xD;
      school-age children during the pandemics and whether there is a relationship between the&#xD;
      decreased level of physical activity, increased screen time, poor posture and musculoskeletal&#xD;
      complaints.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A survey assessing musculoskeletal pain in children in the last 1 month, and associated&#xD;
      factors including presence of non-ergonomic postures during online education was structured&#xD;
      by two physiatrists and a public health specialist after the review of the relevant&#xD;
      literature. Several paediatric pain and musculoskeletal assessment tools were reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The survey consisted of a total of 66 questions including sociodemographic characteristics of&#xD;
      the children and family (17 items), education hours, used technological device (7 items),&#xD;
      screen time and physical activity (5 items), presence of musculoskeletal pain (27 items) and&#xD;
      ergonomics (10 items).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questions regarding the musculoskeletal pain were constructed based on The Nordic&#xD;
      musculoskeletal questionnaire extended version (NMQ-E) which was translated and validated&#xD;
      into Turkish. Pain or discomfort questions experienced in the nine body parts with binary&#xD;
      choices (yes or no) were used. The figure in NMQ-E was used to describe body regions (the&#xD;
      neck, shoulder, upper back, elbow, wrist/hand, low back, hip/ thigh, knee, ankle/foot) and&#xD;
      pain questions were structured accordingly on this body diagram.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaire was created using the Qualtrics program. The survey was piloted among ten&#xD;
      participants to ensure its readability and ease of completion. After obtaining permissions&#xD;
      from Ministry of National Education of Turkey, survey link was shared with the school&#xD;
      principles so that they distributed the survey to the guardians of children via smart phones&#xD;
      or email. The survey will be available during two months and a reminder will be sent once a&#xD;
      week.&#xD;

        A sample size of 1225 participants was calculated by assuming a musculoskeletal pain&#xD;
        prevalence of 15% among children between the ages 6-13, with a confidence limit of 95% with&#xD;
        a margin of error 2%.&#xD;
