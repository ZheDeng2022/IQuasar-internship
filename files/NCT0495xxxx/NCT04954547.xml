      This 24-week-long study compares the effectiveness of two types of incentives for weight&#xD;
      loss: 1) conditional subsidy 2) financial goal reward. Target participants are overweight&#xD;
      female Singaporeans or Permanent Residents who are otherwise healthy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study, which spans 24 weeks (12 treatment, 12 post-treatment), aims to compare the&#xD;
      effectiveness of 2 financial incentive structures - a conditional subsidy versus a goal&#xD;
      reward - on fat loss. 600 overweight but otherwise healthy female Singaporeans or Permanent&#xD;
      Residents will be recruited via 2 recruitment phases, 2 months apart from each other.&#xD;
      Participants will be given an individual-tailored percentage body fat (PBF) goal and assigned&#xD;
      to one of two interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Subsidy treatment group (STG) - Participants will be awarded $X for reaching the PBF&#xD;
           goal at the end of 12 weeks. Regardless of goal attainment, participants will also be&#xD;
           reimbursed 50% of approved health-improving expenses up to a cap of $Y in the 12 weeks.&#xD;
           The subsidy is voluntary and flexible, with no direct intervention from researchers -&#xD;
           participants will submit receipts to the program website and simply be reimbursed at the&#xD;
           end of the experiment. To prevent cheating, all receipts must bear the participants'&#xD;
           full name or be justifiably traceable to them. When submitting the receipt to the&#xD;
           program website, they must also specify the purpose of the expense - this serves as a&#xD;
           psychological reminder to utilize the expense more meaningfully, while allowing us to&#xD;
           discern better to approve or reject the reimbursement claim.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cash treatment group (CTG). Participants will be awarded $(X+Y) for reaching the PBF&#xD;
           goal at the end of 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be given an individual-tailored 12-week PBF goal. The formula for this&#xD;
      goal will be set following the approval of the IRB, in consultation with medical and fitness&#xD;
      professionals (including certified doctors and fitness trainers) to ensure that it is safe,&#xD;
      challenging, and achievable. The base formula, which assumes a 5% weight loss as is often&#xD;
      defined to be the medically significant level, is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (P*W-x*5%*W)/(95%*W)&#xD;
&#xD;
      where P is PBF at baseline (week 1), W is body mass in kg at baseline, PÃ—W is their body fat&#xD;
      mass at baseline, and x, ranging between 0% and 100%, is the parameter that is set in&#xD;
      consultation with professionals. At 100%, it implies that all 5% in weight loss is from fat,&#xD;
      vice versa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because P and W differ between most persons, our formula tailors a different goal to each&#xD;
      research subject. Our formula is meant to be flexible toward each participant's baseline&#xD;
      weight and body fat percent. Leveraging the 5% weight loss target, the investigators&#xD;
      determined the expected percentage of this weight that is lost as fat, knowing that weight&#xD;
      loss includes not only fat loss but also other components such as water loss. In previous&#xD;
      studies, for 1 kg loss in weight, on average, 78.8% came from body fat. Hence, the&#xD;
      investigators have targeted 80% of weight loss from our participants to come from body fat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine changes in health, objective measurements will be made during scheduled&#xD;
      participant visits on Weeks 1, 12, and 24. Measures include height, weight, waist&#xD;
      circumference, and PBF. Each participant will also be given a free digital scale for personal&#xD;
      use from home. Their weight and PBF data from the scale will be synchronized to a mobile&#xD;
      application, which we will retrieve with the participant's consent, to examine changes&#xD;
      throughout the study's duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are a total of 3 scheduled visits. The first in Week 1 allows us to determine the&#xD;
      baseline measures. The second visit in Week 12 marks the end of the treatment and allows us&#xD;
      to investigate treatment effects. The last visit in Week 24 checks for post-treatment&#xD;
      effects. During all 3 visits, the participants will also complete a Health Risk Assessment&#xD;
      Survey. This survey should take no longer than 10 minutes to complete, and the research team&#xD;
      will be physically present to assist them with it if so required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the uncertainty of the pandemic, the investigators may hold the second and/or the&#xD;
      third research visits virtually (or at least provide an online option) to avoid large&#xD;
      gatherings if necessary. For each virtual research visit, the research team will contact the&#xD;
      participants through a video call, during which they will step on the weighing scales and&#xD;
      show the readings to the team. If a research visit is held online, the participation&#xD;
      fee/rewards will be sent electronically. The research team will still hold physical meetings&#xD;
      for those who experience technical difficulties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To let participants track their PBF progress, every participant would be given a digital&#xD;
      scale for their keeping even after the research has concluded. The scale, named 'Lite Mould&#xD;
      Body Composition Smart Scale', priced at US$13 (before shipping) is commercially available&#xD;
      and will be supplied by the manufacturer 'Yolanda'. It comes with a free mobile application&#xD;
      to let them track their progress. The app is publicly available on the Apple and Google Play&#xD;
      stores for free under the name 'Feelfit' by Shenzhen QingNiu Software Co. Ltd. Referring to&#xD;
      the Health Products Act (HPA), this scale would not be defined as a &quot;medical device&quot;. The&#xD;
      digital scale serves simply, as would a conventional scale, to inform the user on some bodily&#xD;
      metric. It does not attempt to make any medical judgment or recommendation for the user. The&#xD;
      research team has done testing on the digital scale and is satisfied with the precision of&#xD;
      the device. The participants are expected to weigh-in on the scales weekly from home at their&#xD;
      convenience. In the middle of each of the 12 weeks (e.g. Wednesday or Thursday), an automated&#xD;
      email will be sent to the participants reminding them to do so by the end of the week&#xD;
      (Sunday). Non-compliance will not be penalized, but participants are strongly encouraged to&#xD;
      weigh-in. The following is the complete list of data that the participants will have access&#xD;
      to from the scale's mobile application. The researchers, with the participants' consent, will&#xD;
      also retrieve this data for analysis: 1. Basal metabolism rate; 2. BMI; 3. Bone mass; 4.&#xD;
      Metabolic age; 5. Muscle mass; 6. PBF; 7. Skeletal muscle weight ratio; 8. Subcutaneous fat;&#xD;
      9. Total body water; 10. Visceral fat; 11. Weight&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be split into two waves of 300 participants. The investigators will start the&#xD;
      first wave when they successfully recruit 300 eligible participants in the first recruitment&#xD;
      phase and the second wave with another 300 eligible participants in the second recruitment&#xD;
      phase.&#xD;
