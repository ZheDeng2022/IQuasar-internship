    <textblock>
      The next-generation sequencing (NGS) based on liquid biopsy has been an emerging technology&#xD;
      to identify tumor-specific genetic aberrations in malignant tumors. The tumor tissue (FFPE)&#xD;
      and plasma samples from the newly diagnosed pediatric mature B-NHL patients were collected&#xD;
      and sequenced by 475 genes panel before, during and post treatment, to evaluate the&#xD;
      significance of the ctDNA in efficacy prediction, predicting recurrence or mechanism of&#xD;
      resistance to chemotherapy for pediatric mature B-NHL.&#xD;

      This is a prospective, multi-center, observational cohort study. Clinical stage system, risk&#xD;
      stratification and treatment for pediatric mature B-NHL were according to the modified BFM-95&#xD;
      protocol. The tumor tissue (FFPE) and plasma samples (bone marrow or cerebrospinal fluid&#xD;
      samples if necessary) from the newly diagnosed patients were collected and sequenced by 475&#xD;
      genes panel before, during and post treatment. Collection and analysis the results of ctDNA&#xD;
      and chemotherapy response, to explore the mutation map of pediatric mature B-NHL and to&#xD;
      evaluate the significance of liquid biopsy for efficacy prediction, predicting recurrence,&#xD;
      mechanism of resistance to chemotherapy.&#xD;

&#xD;
               1. Incomplete baseline samples (preoperative plasma samples, tissue, bone marrow,&#xD;
                  cerebrospinal fluid) due to various reasons;&#xD;
