  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the effect of nivolumab in treating patients with solid tumors&#xD;
      that have spread to other places in the body (metastatic) or cannot be removed by surgery&#xD;
      (unresectable) with RID1A mutation and CXCL13 expression. Immunotherapy with monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may&#xD;
      interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving nivolumab may help to&#xD;
      control the disease.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate objective response rate (ORR) and overall survival (OS) in patients with&#xD;
      ARID1A mutations receiving nivolumab therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate objective response rate (ORR) and overall survival (OS) in patients with&#xD;
      ARID1A mutations plus CXCL13-high expression and ARID1A mutations plus CXCL13-low expression,&#xD;
      receiving nivolumab therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate progression free survival (PFS) in subjects with harboring ARID1A mutation&#xD;
      treated with nivolumab monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate progression free survival (PFS) in subjects with ARID1A mutations plus&#xD;
      CXCL13-high expression and ARID1A mutations plus CXCL13-low expression, treated with&#xD;
      nivolumab monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess peripheral and tumor infiltrating immune cell sub-populations in patients with&#xD;
      ARID1A mutations, ARID1A plus CXCL13-high and ARID1A plus CXCL13-low expression, to determine&#xD;
      predictors of response and resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine expression pattern of CXCL13 in ARID1A mutant tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every&#xD;
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months.&#xD;
