      For fresh femoral neck fracture internal fixation, both DHS and CCS can make strong fixation&#xD;
      of hip and have good recovery. There is no statistical difference in complications after&#xD;
      surgery between the two procedures. Patients with DHS internal fixation have earlier&#xD;
      postoperative weight bearing, which is conducive to functional exercise of the injured limb.&#xD;
      DHS internal fixation system is recommended for patients with unstable fractures and severe&#xD;
      osteoporosis.&#xD;

      Objective: To compare the clinical effect of dynamic hip screw (DHS) and cannulated&#xD;
      compression screw (CCS) in the treatment of fresh femoral neck fracture. Methods: A&#xD;
      retrospective study was conducted to analyze the data of 91 patients with fresh femoral neck&#xD;
      fracture treated with DHS or CCS in our hospital from January 2012 to June 2016.The cases&#xD;
      were divided into two groups according to internal fixation: 44 cases in the DHS group and 47&#xD;
      cases in the CCS group. By comparing operative time, intraoperative bleeding, postoperative&#xD;
      load, Harris scoring and the complications such as postoperative necrosis of femoral head and&#xD;
      shortening of femoral neck appearance, we evaluated the clinical curative effect of two kinds&#xD;
      of fixation.&#xD;
