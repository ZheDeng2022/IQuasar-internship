      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of low-dose IL-2 in the&#xD;
      treatment of immunorelated ALS syndrome.&#xD;

      This is a single-center, open-label, self-controlled clinical study with a sample size of 10&#xD;
      patients for 48 weeks, including 24 weeks of administration, and 24 weeks of follow-up.&#xD;
      During the administration period, medication was given for 2 weeks and rest for 2 weeks, as a&#xD;
      course of treatment, with a total of 6 courses for 24 weeks. During the administration&#xD;
      period, the drug was given on alternate days, and IL-2 1mIU was subcutaneously injected the&#xD;
      next day for 7 times, and then rested for 2 weeks, and the cycle was repeated for 6 times.&#xD;
      The primary outcome index was the change in the rate of ALSFRS-R score between administration&#xD;
      period and follow-up period. Secondary outcome measures included changes in the rate of&#xD;
      ALSAQ-40 score, ROADS score, MRC score, survival time, FVC%, Treg and CD4+ T cell subsets,&#xD;
      inflammatory factors, serum and cerebrospinal fluid NFL during follow-up versus&#xD;
      administration , changes in the inhibition function of Treg; Exploratory outcome indicators&#xD;
      included the change degree of compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude, quantitative&#xD;
      analysis of corneal nerve morphologic changes by corneal confocal microscopy (CCM), Treg&#xD;
      single-cell sequencing transcriptome analysis. The related safety indexes were also&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;
