  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the objective is to evaluate available technology designed to support&#xD;
      self-care at home of elderly patients with multimorbidity. Of people who are 85 years or&#xD;
      older, about 60% have two or more chronic diseases. The symptom burden is extensive, and&#xD;
      periods of deterioration often lead to hospitalizations and early readmissions to hospital. A&#xD;
      contributing factor for the high consumption of care is that many patients find it difficult&#xD;
      to identify signs of deterioration and in time take appropriate action. Technology placed in&#xD;
      patients' home are becoming common and have shown to increase quality of life and reduce the&#xD;
      need for in-hospital care but few tools are used in regular care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators want to see which effect technologies placed at home has on; healthcare&#xD;
      consumption, self-care, depression, well-being and activity level. Further, the&#xD;
      implementation process from both patients, relatives and healthcare personals perspective&#xD;
      will be studied using a hybrid design, which makes it possible to study both barriers and&#xD;
      facilitators of the implementation and efficacy of the technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In phase one participants will be recruited from a care team where an established&#xD;
      collaboration between region and municipality has been developed. In phase two, inclusion&#xD;
      takes place in an entire municipality without a previously established collaboration. The&#xD;
      goal is to increase patients and family members wellbeing, health and functional ability&#xD;
      while maintaining or reducing healthcare costs.&#xD;

      PURPOSE AND AIMS In this study, the objective is to evaluate available digital technology&#xD;
      with remote symptom monitoring designed to support self-care at home of elderly patients with&#xD;
      multimorbidity. There are a lot of technology with the possibility to remotely monitor signs&#xD;
      and symptoms placed in patients' home available. This technology have been shown to increase&#xD;
      quality of life, experiences of security and reduce the need for in-hospital care, but few&#xD;
      tools are implemented in routine care of elderly with multimorbidity and extensive needs of&#xD;
      coordinated health and community care. Limited collaboration and lack of joint care goals&#xD;
      between the different care providers are known barriers of implementation of digital&#xD;
      technology with remote symptom monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aims of the project are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To describe the implementation process of digital technology in two different care&#xD;
           settings from both patients, family members, and healthcare professional's perspective.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the feasibility of digital technology for remote symptom monitoring and&#xD;
           digital consultations with the caregiver in the home of elderly patients with&#xD;
           multimorbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To examine the effectiveness of the technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific research questions the study is set to answer:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What effects does the use of digital technology for remote symptom monitoring have on&#xD;
           elderly patients with multimorbidity's healthcare consumption, self-care management,&#xD;
           depression, experience of control over the disease, well-being and activity level?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. How do patients and informal caregivers perceive that the use of digital technology at&#xD;
           home affects the ability to manage the patient's health situation?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. How do physicians, nurses and assistant nurses experience the use of remote monitoring&#xD;
           in their daily work?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Which are the barriers to and facilitators for implementation of digital technology?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Does digital technology reduce the risk of hospitalisation and healthcare costs in&#xD;
           elderly patients with multimorbidity?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has a hybrid design, which means a double focus: both the implementation process&#xD;
      and the clinical outcomes are studied simultaneously through a mixed data collection with&#xD;
      both quantitative and qualitative parts. The implementation process will be based on The&#xD;
      Quality Implementation Framework.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1; During winter 2021-22 the implementation process of digital technology with remote&#xD;
      symptom monitoring with adaptation and preparation in the care team will begin. The team&#xD;
      needs to develop a structure for handling the incoming patient data and develop action plans&#xD;
      on how to act in case of symptoms and signs of deterioration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The technology, OPTILOGG PLUS, will be place in patients' home.It consists of a tablet with&#xD;
      personalized sensors, such as weighing scale, blood pressure, oxygenation and activity meters&#xD;
      based on the patient's individual needs. The technology also includes a platform for digital&#xD;
      consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient performs measurements at home every morning and sends data to the receiving&#xD;
      station installed in the care teams' premises where the staff access the patient's data via&#xD;
      secure login.The main purpose of the technology is to enhance the patients' self-care&#xD;
      behaviour, and coach them to contact the healthcare provider if and when self-care is not&#xD;
      enough to prevent deterioration. Also the caregiver can initiate a virtual home visit or a&#xD;
      physical home visit if they observe signs of deterioration not recognised by the patient.&#xD;
