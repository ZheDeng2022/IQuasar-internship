  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate lower limb impairments in children with bilateral&#xD;
      cerebral palsy during stepping tasks.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with bilateral cerebral palsy (BCP) sustain a neonatal brain injury that leads to&#xD;
      altered neuromuscular control to the lower limbs. One commonly observed motor impairment from&#xD;
      this altered control is loss of selective voluntary motor control (SVMC), defined as the&#xD;
      ability to independently move the joints intentionally. Loss of SVMC typically manifests as&#xD;
      knee and ankle joint impairment and abnormal coupling between the hip adductors and lower&#xD;
      limb extensors. This can make stepping up or down a curb or stair challenging, but&#xD;
      quantitative investigation in these closed-chain activities has been limited. This is&#xD;
      especially important as performance in stair-climbing is associated with limitations to&#xD;
      overall mobility and community participation in cerebral palsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of this proposal is to investigate the altered neuromuscular control that&#xD;
      challenges stair walking in individuals with BCP. Participants who consent to the study will&#xD;
      be instructed to perform multiple step-ups and step-downs on a single raised platform. The&#xD;
      parameters of the stepping task may change by adding weight to the body or subtracting weight&#xD;
      from the body. Using standard gait analysis techniques, biomechanical metrics such as joint&#xD;
      kinematics and kinetics will be analyzed.&#xD;
