  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Collection of SARS-COV-2 Secretions and Serum for Countermeasure Development (aka ClinSeqSer)&#xD;
      is an observational study to understand natural history of SARS-COV-2 infections among&#xD;
      special populations and characterise post-covid morbidity through immune response, virus&#xD;
      genome sequencing, cytokine response, and virus shedding. Given the descriptions of infection&#xD;
      course of patients over the outbreak of 2003 (SARS-Cov01) and since January 2019 in China and&#xD;
      Europe, and now worldwide:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Acutely infected patients shed virus that could be of major interest to characterize&#xD;
           (viral quantification, characterization of virus shedding -of infective and of&#xD;
           non-infective virus) the former reflecting/predictive of severity of disease and the&#xD;
           latter reflecting extent/source of contagiosity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Convalescent infected patients develop a specific anti-virus antibody response that is&#xD;
           (likely) protective and therefore suits the preliminary requirement for the potential&#xD;
           benefits of the convalescent patient plasma therapeutic infusion approach. In addition,&#xD;
           long term effects of COVID-19 commonly known as long-haulers remains clinically unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thousands of patients have now been diagnosed with COVID-19 in Louisiana (444,000 cases,&#xD;
      10,122 deaths, 2.2% mortality in Louisiana (LA), as of March 2021), and numerous patients are&#xD;
      now also complaining of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC). The investigators want to&#xD;
      further clarify questions surrounding rational confinement duration and therapeutic approach&#xD;
      by collecting plasma of convalescent patients to identify optimal antibody titer by ELISA,&#xD;
      specificity of naturally occurring inflammatory (protein/antibody and RNA) response, and&#xD;
      possibly test in vitro antibody neutralization activity.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are proposing two strategies to help mitigate COVID-19:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Establish active data registry for infected patients, which includes both sequence of&#xD;
           viral isolate and clinical course. The purpose of this would be to determine whether&#xD;
           sequences are evolving, which might affect planned countermeasures, and to evaluate&#xD;
           which comorbidities/concurrent medications/clinical findings are the highest predictors&#xD;
           for risk. This could allow us to better target screening and triage efforts, and&#xD;
           potentially discontinue/substitute out medications that are worsening infection. For&#xD;
           example, if diabetics confirm to be a particularly high risk they should potentially&#xD;
           receive more rigorous screening, earlier admission, earlier medication optimization. For&#xD;
           another example, there is some concern that patients with hypertension on angiotensin&#xD;
           receptor blocking agents may have enhanced expression of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme&#xD;
           (ACE-2), the entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2. If the investigators can confirm whether&#xD;
           patients on Angiotensin Receptor Blocker (ARBs) have severe outcomes, this would justify&#xD;
           the potential switch to alternate agents. Collect serum/plasma from convalescent&#xD;
           patients. Patients who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and have recovered (&gt;14 days&#xD;
           since diagnosis) or individuals with no defined past COVID-19 infection, but the&#xD;
           potential to have been exposed to (and mounted antibodies against) COVID-19 will provide&#xD;
           a sample of whole blood, as well as other samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine long-term sequelae and pulmonary-related health outcomes for infected patients&#xD;
           with COVID-19. Patients who survive infection with SARS Cov-2 are at risk of physical&#xD;
           and psychological complications of lung injury. The investigators aim to determine the&#xD;
           long-term sequelae of this infection. This would allow the investigators to better&#xD;
           understand the long-term health impacts (physiological, functional, and quality-of-life)&#xD;
           of this disease. Specifically, they aim to 1) conduct a systematic study of subjects&#xD;
           post-COVID in order to determine which part(s) of that morbidity (clinical and&#xD;
           laboratory) is caused by COVID, and 2) Identify predictors of post-COVID morbidity,&#xD;
           including any protective role of treatments used during acute infection, and identify&#xD;
           biomarkers (virus and host) that might be associated with severity/duration of the&#xD;
           post-COVID syndrome. Overall, the investigators aim to define the entity of post-COVID&#xD;
           morbidity, or post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC) so that they can then begin to&#xD;
           explore methods to treat, and, ideally, prevent this morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are expanding the criteria for inclusion in this study to other viruses in&#xD;
      order to&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Develop a comparator group to determine whether immunomodulation induced by SARS CoV-2&#xD;
           differs from other respiratory viruses,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Prepare for both routine seasonal and potential future influenza pandemic, which has&#xD;
           been an ongoing concern for years now, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Expand their ability to monitor for potential intermixing of seasonal coronaviruses and&#xD;
           SARS CoV-2, which could impact diagnostic tests for both.&#xD;
