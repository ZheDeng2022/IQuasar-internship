  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this pilot study, patients with non-curable esophageal cancer will be treated with&#xD;
      endoscopic assisted calcium electroporation (CaEP). CaEP is a novel cancer treatment where&#xD;
      intratumoral injection with calcium is combined with locally applied electrical pulses, in&#xD;
      order to increase calcium influx which leads to tumor necrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Endoscopic assisted CaEP is a safe and feasible procedure in patients with non-curable&#xD;
           esophageal cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CaEP debulks the tumor, facilitating the patient's ability to eat and drink&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this single-arm pilot study, eight patients will be treated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Electroporation facilitates the transport of molecules across the cell membrane and into the&#xD;
      cell by means of electrical pulses. An electric field applied to the cell destabilizes the&#xD;
      cell membrane forming cracks, which reseals after a few minutes. During this time slot,&#xD;
      molecules which normally are impermeable to the cell membrane are able to cross into the&#xD;
      cytosol of the cell. Within the last ten years, studies have shown that the combination of&#xD;
      intratumoral injection of calcium and electroporation (Calcium electroporation/CaEP) is an&#xD;
      effective method in killing cancer cells. CaEP has been evaluated in clinical studies in&#xD;
      colorectal cancer, carcinomas in the head and neck area, and in cutaneous metastases with&#xD;
      promising results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this single-arm pilot study, eight patients with non-curable esophageal cancer will be&#xD;
      included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Endoscopic assisted CaEP is a safe and feasible procedure in patients with non-curable&#xD;
           esophageal cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CaEP debulks the tumor, facilitating the patient's ability to eat and drink&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CaEP induces a systemic immunological response&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate the safety of CaEP for esophageal cancer. Adverse Events&#xD;
      (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE) will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  dysphagia (Mellow Pinkas dysphagia score)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  pain (Numeric Rating Scale, NRS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  quality of life (QoL) (EORTC QLQ-C30)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  tumor response evaluated from computed tomography (CT) and upper endoscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  immunologic response&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tertiary outcomes include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ✓ 90-days survival&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are initially treated once according to protocol. If well-tolerated, the&#xD;
      treatment can be repeated.&#xD;
