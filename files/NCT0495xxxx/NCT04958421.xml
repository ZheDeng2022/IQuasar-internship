      The objective of this study is to assess safety and feasibility of Pressure-controlled&#xD;
      intermittent Coronary Sinus Occlusion (PiCSO) therapy in patients with extensive ST elevation&#xD;
      inferior wall myocardial infarction presenting with TIMI 0 or 1 and symptom duration ≤ 12&#xD;
      hours undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) compared to standard PCI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized (2 PiCSO :1 Control), controlled, pilot study to evaluate&#xD;
      safety and feasibility of Pressure-controlled intermittent Coronary Sinus Occlusion (PiCSO)&#xD;
      therapy in patients with extensive ST elevation inferior wall myocardial infarction&#xD;
      presenting with TIMI 0 or 1 and symptom duration ≤ 12 hours treated adjunct to percutaneous&#xD;
      coronary intervention (PCI) compared to standard PCI. Patients with an ST-segment elevated&#xD;
      inferior infarct eligible for PCI will be invited to participate in the PiCSO-AMI-V Inferior&#xD;
      STEMI study. After consent as per approved ethics committee requirements, baseline&#xD;
      assessments will be performed. PCI of the culprit vessel should be performed per standard&#xD;
      practices. After TIMI flow restoration, the subjects meeting all eligibility criteria will be&#xD;
      enrolled into the study and randomized either to PiCSO Group or Control Group. If the subject&#xD;
      is randomized to PiCSO Group, the coronary sinus (CS) will be cannulated through the femoral&#xD;
      vein and the PiCSO Impulse Catheter will be placed in the CS. In the event the PiCSO Impulse&#xD;
      Catheter cannot be placed in the CS within 30 minutes, the physician should proceed with the&#xD;
      regular PCI and the PiCSO treatment will be considered a failure. Once PiCSO Impulse Catheter&#xD;
      is placed into CS, PiCSO treatment is started followed by stenting. The physician shall&#xD;
      target a PiCSO treatment of 45 minutes whereas the treatment should be continued during and&#xD;
      post stent insertion. At the end of the PiCSO treatment, the PiCSO Impulse Console is stopped&#xD;
      and the PiCSO Impulse Catheter is removed. The patient is seen for a FU visit at 12-36 hours,&#xD;
      30 days, 6 months and 1 year post index procedure. 12-36 hours and 6 months post index the&#xD;
      patient will get a echocardiogram. At every FU visit safety data and health status will be&#xD;
      documented.&#xD;
