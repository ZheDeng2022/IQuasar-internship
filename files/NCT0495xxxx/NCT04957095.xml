  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The brain networks controlling movement are complex, involving multiple areas of the brain.&#xD;
      Some neurological disorders, like Parkinson's disease (PD) and essential tremor (ET), cause&#xD;
      abnormalities in these brain networks. Deep brain stimulation is a treatment that is used to&#xD;
      treat these types of neurological diseases and is thought to help patients by modulating&#xD;
      brain networks responsible for movement. Levodopa medication is also used to modulate this&#xD;
      brain networks in patients with PD. The overall objective is to develop a unified theory of&#xD;
      basal ganglia thalamocortical (BGTC) circuit dynamics that accounts for disease&#xD;
      symptomatology, movement, and their inter-relationship. The underlying hypothesis, is that&#xD;
      the rigidity and bradykinesia of PD are fundamentally related to excessive functional&#xD;
      coupling across nodes in the BGTC motor circuit impeding effective information flow. In this&#xD;
      research, the investigator will take advantage of the unique opportunity provided by awake&#xD;
      deep brain stimulation surgery to learn more about how the brain functions in a diseased&#xD;
      state and how deep brain stimulation changes these networks to make movement more normal. The&#xD;
      investigator will simultaneously assess cortical and subcortical electrophysiology in&#xD;
      relation to clinical symptoms and behavioral measures and in response to deep brain&#xD;
      stimulation, cortical stimulation, and pharmacologic therapy in patients undergoing Deep&#xD;
      Brain Stimulation (DBS) implantation surgery.&#xD;
