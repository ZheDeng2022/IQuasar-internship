  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical, data collection study conducted at one site. This study will collect open&#xD;
      comments, user feedback and parameter raw data to support patient monitoring product&#xD;
      development. Subjects participating in this study will be monitored with the site's standard&#xD;
      of care primary monitor and the investigational device as the secondary monitor while&#xD;
      enrolled in this study. No subject care decisions or diagnoses will be made based on&#xD;
      information obtained from the investigational secondary monitor.&#xD;

      This is a pre-market, open label, prospective, non-randomized, data collection clinical&#xD;
      research study conducted at one investigational site. This study will collect open comments,&#xD;
      user feedback and parameter raw data to support product development. Raw parameter data will&#xD;
      be collected from electrocardiogram (ECG), Pulse Rate (PR), respiratory rate (RR), peripheral&#xD;
      capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2), non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP), and temperature.&#xD;
      Subjects participating in this study will be monitored with the site's standard of care&#xD;
      primary monitor and the investigational device as the secondary monitor while enrolled in&#xD;
      this study. No subject care decisions or diagnoses will be made based on information obtained&#xD;
      from the investigational secondary monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation is expected to last no more than 72 hours.&#xD;
