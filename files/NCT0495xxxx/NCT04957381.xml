  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the different cardiopulmonary and muscular fitness of community-dwelling older&#xD;
      adults on healthy aging, and to identify the optimal cutoff points of their cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      fitness and muscular fitness on targeting healthy aging.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      At the end of the 20th century, the WHO began to promote the issue of healthy aging. From&#xD;
      then on, the Taiwan government gradually attached importance to long-term care and devoted to&#xD;
      developing community-based health promotion programs for the elderly. Currently, the programs&#xD;
      commonly plan to proceed through the group exercise intervention, increasing physical&#xD;
      activity to improve their physical fitness and also to prevent their functional disability.&#xD;
      This study aims to compare the different cardiorespiratory fitness and muscular fitness of&#xD;
      community-dwelling older adults on healthy aging, and figure out to what extent of&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory fitness level and muscular fitness level may achieve healthy aging. The&#xD;
      present healthy status of participants will be investigated by interviewing if having any&#xD;
      disability or frail. Based on multidimensional model, the definition and measurement of&#xD;
      healthy aging status include physiological, psychological and social function aspect. In this&#xD;
      study, the health aging status is defined as non-frailty, independence in basic and&#xD;
      instrumental activities of daily living, normal cognitive function, absent of depression&#xD;
      status, good social relations and good environmental support.&#xD;
