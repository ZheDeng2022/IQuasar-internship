    <textblock>
      The habit of family meals makes the infection rate of Helicobacter pylori high in China,&#xD;
      which is also the main cause of reinfection of Helicobacter pylori. Eating together can&#xD;
      easily cause family members to be infected with Helicobacter pylori. We used a real-world&#xD;
      study to understand the risk factors, epidemiological characteristics, and safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness of eradication therapy for helicobacter pylori infection in family-based&#xD;
      screening and treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Helicobacter pylori infection is a worldwide problem, which is the main cause of gastric&#xD;
      cancer. The habit of sharing meals in the family is one of the factors contributing to the&#xD;
      high infection rate of HP in China, as well as the main cause of reinfection of HP. Sharing&#xD;
      meals can easily cause family members to be infected with HP.Family members live together,&#xD;
      eat together, share tableware and other behaviors through the &quot;mouth to mouth&quot; transmission&#xD;
      of Helicobacter pylori may be infected with each other, is also one of the reasons for the&#xD;
      eradication of many patients after re-infection.At the same time, repeated infection and&#xD;
      treatment of Helicobacter pylori will increase the difficulty of Helicobacter pylori&#xD;
      reeradication.As a family unit, to study the status of our country family helicobacter pylori&#xD;
      infection, epidemiological characteristics, infection risk factor, the different schemes,&#xD;
      such as the safety and efficacy of treatment to take measures to reduce the infection rate is&#xD;
      of great significance to prevention and treatment of gastric cancer.&#xD;
