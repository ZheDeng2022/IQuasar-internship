      This study will perform an early Phase I feasibility study with single-arm, double-baseline&#xD;
      repeated measured design. The investigators will test the feasibility of using focal&#xD;
      vibration to improve symptoms of persistent CIPN.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 80% of individuals treated with neurotoxic chemotherapy experience chemotherapy-induced&#xD;
      peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), and nearly 50% of those cancer survivors will have CIPN&#xD;
      symptoms an average of 6 years later. CIPN symptoms, characteristically numbness and tingling&#xD;
      that is often painful, double a cancer survivor's age-predicted risk of falls, and threaten&#xD;
      their quality of life. Further, CIPN symptoms can worsen with physical activity, leading to&#xD;
      sedentary behavior and subsequent negative health consequences. Although many approaches have&#xD;
      been trialed, there is still no approved, universally effective CIPN treatment, but focal&#xD;
      vibration (FV) therapy may hold promise. The investigators have used wearable FV (Myovolt)&#xD;
      and app, and found its use feasible in diabetic peripheral neuropathy. The investigators&#xD;
      believe Myovolt could also benefit cancer survivors with CIPN, potentially improving their&#xD;
      neuropathic symptoms to optimize their quality of life and wellness. As a first step, the&#xD;
      investigators propose an early Phase I feasibility study with single-arm, double-baseline&#xD;
      repeated measured design. The investigators will test the feasibility of using Myovolt to&#xD;
      improve symptoms of persistent CIPN. Secondarily, the investigators will explore the impact&#xD;
      of vibration dosage on CIPN symptoms, physical activity, functional performance, and quality&#xD;
      of life. If effective, Myovolt could address CIPN with minimal to no side-effects, and be&#xD;
      especially useful for those cancer survivors who are unable to access exercise options, or&#xD;
      tolerate exercise because of CIPN symptoms. This study will support larger Phase I and II&#xD;
      clinical studies designed to further optimize the dose of vibration, and later studies to&#xD;
      assess the efficacy and effectiveness of this device in CIPN.&#xD;

Myovolt intensity will be set to ~up to 2X the participant's initial Myovolt perception threshold (however, the maximum intensity will be limited to 19.1g which is the maximum intensity the device can deliver). If the stimulation does not feel strong, the participant will be asked to manually increase the intensity until it feels strong but comfortable.</description>

    <description>Myovolt is a wearable rehabilitative device that delivers vibration with a frequency between 60-300 Hz, and acceleration force between 1.8g to 19.1g peak to peak. Myovolt intensity will be set to ~up to 2X the participant's initial Myovolt perception threshold. If the stimulation does not feel strong, the participant will be asked to manually increase the intensity until it feels strong but comfortable. During the first 3 weeks of the study, participants will be asked to use the device for 2 individual 0.5-hour sessions daily, once in the morning and once in the evening. During the second 3 weeks of the study, participants will be permitted to continue using the device for 2 individual 0.5 hour sessions per day, or to wear the device so that it automatically alternates between 0.5-hour treatment and 0.5-hour rest periods for up to 2 hours of stimulation daily before locking out.</description>
