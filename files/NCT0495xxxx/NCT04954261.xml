  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to introduce delirium detection and try to determine the&#xD;
      prevalence of delirium in Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) using a validated tool : the&#xD;
      Cornell Assessment of Pediatric Delirium (CAPD) for every patient twice a day.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Delirium is a frequent affection in ICU. In adult population, its prevalence is 20-50% in non&#xD;
      intubated patients and 60-80% in patients under invasive ventilation. It is also frequent in&#xD;
      paediatric population, but less diagnosed, whereas it can lead to higher duration stay,&#xD;
      higher morbidity, traumatic injuries, acute stress, memory losses and post-traumatic stress&#xD;
      syndrome. Since 2016, international guidelines recommend to look for delirium in paediatric&#xD;
      population in PICU. There are 3 recommended tools to diagnose this affection: psCAM-ICU (6&#xD;
      months-5 years old), pCAM-ICU (5 years old-18 years old) and CAPD (birth-18 years old).&#xD;
&#xD;
      None of these validated tools have been translated in French.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal objective is to study the practicability of twice a day detection of delirium&#xD;
      in PICU using the CAPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will first used a validation process to translate the CAPD in French, based on&#xD;
      the validation method for psychological questionnaires suggested by Vallerand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then they will ask the paramedics to evaluate through the CAPD every consecutive patient/12&#xD;
      hours, every day during their stay in PICU, except for those completely unresponsive or under&#xD;
      curare. This systematic evaluation will take place for 2 consecutive months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For every patient, data will be collected about their age, sexe, term of birth, mental&#xD;
      affection status, diagnosis at entry, and daily risk of mortality score, length of stay,&#xD;
      ventilation, pain evaluation and treatment, withdrawal evaluation, surroundings, use of&#xD;
      hypnotic treatment, steroids, opioids and ketamine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aims are to determine the prevalence of delirium with the data collected, to&#xD;
      ask whether or not the French version of CAPD has been easily and correctly used, can help to&#xD;
      diagnose delirium, and whether investigators can find some associated parameters to delirium.&#xD;
