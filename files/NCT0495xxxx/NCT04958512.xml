      In this study, the effectiveness of vascular cognitive impairment was compared among the&#xD;
      three groups, namely, the xidezhen group, the Yangxue Qingnao pill group and the placebo&#xD;
      group&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The risk factors of various cerebrovascular diseases (atherosclerosis, stroke, hypertension,&#xD;
      coronary heart disease, atrial fibrillation, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus) are both risk&#xD;
      factors of Alzheimer's disease and one of the many causes of vascular dementia. There are&#xD;
      many manifestations of mental retardation caused by cerebrovascular diseases. The most&#xD;
      prominent aspect is cognitive and behavioral impairment, which is characterized by mental&#xD;
      retardation, forgetfulness, misunderstanding and poor calculation ability. Yangxue Qingnao&#xD;
      pill (z20063808:) is produced by Tianshili Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd, And then improve&#xD;
      the ability of learning and memory. Some clinical application results show that the drug can&#xD;
      significantly improve the cognitive and behavioral ability of patients with ischemic stroke,&#xD;
      improve the cognitive function of patients with mild Alzheimer's disease, and improve the&#xD;
      quality of life. Therefore, this study mainly compared the effectiveness of treatment of&#xD;
      vascular cognitive impairment in three groups, namely, the xidezhen group, the&#xD;
      yangxueqingnaowan group and the placebo group.&#xD;
