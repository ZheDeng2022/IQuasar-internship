    <textblock>
      &quot;Crohn's disease is an inflammatory disease with non-specific clinical manifestations. The&#xD;
      lesions are more common in the ileocecal area and the end of the ileum, and also can affect&#xD;
      the entire digestive tract. In recent years, the domestic incidence of Crohn's disease has&#xD;
      been increasing. At present, CT diagnosis still lacks the gold standard and&#xD;
      requirescombination of clinical manifestations, endoscopic examination, imaging examination&#xD;
      and laboratory examination results. CT has showed advantages of non-invasive inspection, fast&#xD;
      imaging speed, high tissue density resolution, and strong patient acceptability. In addition,&#xD;
      the examination can clearly show the internal and external tissue structure of the digestive&#xD;
      tract, which has been widely used in the diagnosis and activity evaluation of Crohn's&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to clarify the clinical value of CT in assessing the activity of Crohn's disease,&#xD;
      this study mainly used retrospective analysis of the CT manifestations and clinical data of&#xD;
      patients with Crohn's disease to explore the clinical value of CT in assessing the activity&#xD;
      of patients with Crohn's disease.&quot;&#xD;
