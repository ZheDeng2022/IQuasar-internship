    <textblock>
      This study is a phase 1, open-label, randomized, first-in-human clinical trial to evaluate&#xD;
      the safety, tolerability and reactogenicity of escalating doses of Baiya SARS-CoV-2 VAX1&#xD;
      vaccine in participants aged 18-60 for adult groups and 61-75 for elderly groups. Each group&#xD;
      will consist of three cohorts to evaluate different doses (low, medium, high) of Baiya&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 VAX vaccine. Participants will be injected with two doses of the investigational&#xD;
      product with a 21-day interval.&#xD;
