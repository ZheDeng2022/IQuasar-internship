  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyperuricemia is seen in about 20% of adults in the general population, Chronic&#xD;
      hyperuricemia, frequently manifesting as the gout, is a well-known risk factor of joint&#xD;
      damage but has been also linked to a variety of other pathologies mostly affecting the&#xD;
      cardiovascular system. The close relation between high uric acid concentration and increased&#xD;
      risk of cardiovascular disease has been reported for more than a century. Furthermore, many&#xD;
      studies reported a strong association between hyperuricemia, arterial hypertension, obesity&#xD;
      and cardiovascular diseases even in an absence of typical clinical manifestations of gout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies showed that the prevalence of hyperuricemia in patients with hypertension is&#xD;
      much higher than in the general population and may worsen after the onset of antihypertensive&#xD;
      treatment. That may indicate that hyperuricemia may be also caused by antihypertensive drugs.&#xD;
      In contrast to diuretics and nonselective beta blockers the agents that block the&#xD;
      renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system have had a neutral effect on serum uric acid. Several&#xD;
      clinical studies showed that losartan in contrast to other AT1-receptor agonists, may have&#xD;
      specific uricosuric properties and thereby can lower uric acid concentration. It has been&#xD;
      speculated that uricosuric effect could make losartan particularly useful for the treatment&#xD;
      of arterial hypertension associated with hyperuricemia and metabolic syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The uricosuric effect of losartan is most likely due to overlapping two different mechanisms&#xD;
      regulating the excretion of uric acid. Losartan may increase uric acid tubular secretion in&#xD;
      the same way as other inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, but in addition&#xD;
      it may specifically inhibit post-secretory resorption of uric acid in the proximal tubule.&#xD;
      The effect may be due to a specific structure of the losartan molecule. The urateanion&#xD;
      transporter is a monoammonium selective transporter, and the losartan molecule is mainly a&#xD;
      monoanion at normal pH range (as opposed to dianion e.g. eprosartan) and therefore is a good&#xD;
      substrate for the exchanger. However, this concept remains speculative since, e.g. irbesartan&#xD;
      which is also a monoanion has no consistent uricosuric effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fructose, in contrast to other carbohydrates causes an increase of serum uric acid&#xD;
      concentration, which may facilitate the development of the metabolic syndrome.&#xD;

      The study group included 16 patients (15F, 1M, mean age 64.5 ± 9.8 years). The patients&#xD;
      selected for the study fulfilled the AHA/NHLBI 2005 criteria of the meta-bolic syndrome [30]&#xD;
      and ESC/ESH criteria of arterial hypertension. The exclusion cri-teria included an&#xD;
      antihypertensive therapy with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis blocking agent used&#xD;
      anytime during last 3 months, current or past therapy with SGLT2 inhibitor, GLP-1 agonist or&#xD;
      DPP4-inhibitor, suspected or confirmed secondary form of hypertension, estimated glomerular&#xD;
      filtration rate &lt;60 ml/min/1.73 m2, chron-ic liver disease, acute infection, psychiatric&#xD;
      disorders, mean serum potassium con-centration at last three measurements &lt;4.0 mmol/l, or&#xD;
      aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase or creatinine kinase &gt; x1.5 upper&#xD;
      range limit were excluded. Seven patients had diabetes mellitus of which 4 were treated with&#xD;
      insulin. Twelve pa-tients were receiving metformin. Waist circumference was measured on the&#xD;
      initial visit. Plasma lipids and blood glucose were measured in a fasting state during the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was designed as a randomized, crossover, head-to-head comparative study.&#xD;
      Randomization was carried out using MS Excel random number generator. After qualification&#xD;
      each patient was randomly assigned to receive either losartan (Lorista, KRKA, Slovenia) or&#xD;
      eprosartan (Teveten, Solvay Pharmaceuticals, Austral-ia). The patients were taking all other&#xD;
      previously prescribed drugs in unmodified dos-es during the whole course of the study. Each&#xD;
      study drug was given in a random or-der as a single morning dose (50 mg of losartan or 600 mg&#xD;
      of eprosartan) for two periods each lasting 3 months separated by 2-week wash-out time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral fructose tolerance with the administration of 75 g of fructose was con-ducted 3 times&#xD;
      during the study in each patient, i.e. at baseline and after each of the treatment periods.&#xD;
      Before the commencement of OFTT, the patients collected the urine for 2 hours for assessment&#xD;
      of the urinary excretion of uric acid and creatinine. Other baseline measurements included&#xD;
      blood pressure, serum concentration of glu-cose, uric acid, creatinine and plasma lipids&#xD;
      (total, HDL- and, LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides). Subsequent blood samples were taken&#xD;
      three times during each OFTT, i.e. after 30, 60 and 120 minutes from its start to determine&#xD;
      serum uric acid concen-tration. In addition, peripheral blood pressure was measured before&#xD;
      the collection of each blood sample. After 120 minutes blood was also taken to assess plasma&#xD;
      lipids. The second timed 2-hour urine collection was obtained during OFTT. The same&#xD;
      pro-cedures were repeated after each treatment period. The patients took all their&#xD;
      pre-scribed medication including the study drug in the morning 120 minutes before the&#xD;
      beginning of OFTT Routine automated laboratory tests were used to assess blood and urine&#xD;
      pa-rameters. Blood pressure was taken in a sitting position with the aneroid&#xD;
      sphygmo-manometer. Blood pressure was measured both at baseline and after 3-month ther-apy&#xD;
      with each study drug. The mean from four measurements obtained between 0 and 120 minutes OFTT&#xD;
      was taken for the analysis. Blood pressure was measured by a designated single member of the&#xD;
      staff. Mean blood pressure (MAP) was calculated for all measurements as diastolic BP + 1/3 of&#xD;
      pulse pressure (systolic BP - diastolic BP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results are expressed as mean ± SD or median with interquartile range depending on each&#xD;
      variable distribution. 95% confidence intervals were calculated for the changes of the&#xD;
      parameters caused by the treatment. Statistical significance was defined at p&lt;0.05. The&#xD;
      within-group comparisons were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and t-test for normally&#xD;
      distributed variables or alternatively with non-parametric Wilcoxon test. The normality of&#xD;
      the variable distribution was checked with Shapiro-Wilk test. The Pearson or Spearman&#xD;
      correlation coefficient was used to as-sess the relations between variables depending on&#xD;
      their distribution. Area under the curve (AUC) of serum uric acid during oral fructose&#xD;
      tolerance test was calculated using the trapezoidal rule.&#xD;
