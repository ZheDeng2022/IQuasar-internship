  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in a convenience sample of 48 infants admitted to the NICU at the&#xD;
      Montreal Children's Hospital, divided into 2 cohorts (Table 1): (a) Cohort 1 - monitoring for&#xD;
      8h per day for 4 consecutive days and (b) Cohort 2- monitoring for 96h continuously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objectives include: 1- To demonstrate the feasibility of continuous wireless monitoring&#xD;
      in preterm infants with variable degrees of maturity and levels of acuity in a busy NICU. 2-&#xD;
      To develop automated reports of physiological health (or impending ill health) using&#xD;
      continuously acquired physiological signals from the wireless wearable devices. 3- To&#xD;
      evaluate the accuracy of accelerometry in monitoring respiration and help classifying apneas&#xD;
      via measurements of chest and abdominal wall movements.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infants admitted in the NICU are all subject to continuous monitoring of vital signs such as&#xD;
      heart rate, respirations and oxygen saturation (SpO2) by placing sensors, leads, or bands&#xD;
      directly on infant's skin and connecting them to monitors via wires. However, despite the&#xD;
      rapid technological advances in wireless monitoring and wearable devices across various&#xD;
      industries, the health care sector has traditionally lagged. Therefore, the investigators aim&#xD;
      to explore the safety and effectiveness of wireless monitoring (ANNE™ Monitoring System) and&#xD;
      compare it with the traditional wired monitoring system on infants with variable degrees of&#xD;
      maturity in the NICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More specifically, the investigators aim to examine (1) if it is feasible and safe to&#xD;
      implement a continuous wireless monitoring system in preterm infants in the NICU; (2) if it&#xD;
      is feasible to generate automated reports about the infant's physiological wellbeing in&#xD;
      real-time using wireless devices; and (3) if accelerometry is accurate to classify infant's&#xD;
      breathing patterns and apneas through detecting chest and abdominal wall movements.&#xD;

    <description>Once the setup of the study sensors is complete, clinical and physiological data will be continuously acquired for 8h during daytime, for 4 consecutive days. In addition, photographs of the skin at the site of placement of the sensors will be taken before sensors placement and after removal.&#xD;
Hourly axillary temperature measured by the bedside nurse (as part of routine care) will be manually recorded for each patient by the research team. A temperature and humidity recorder will also be placed around 15cm from the infants to continuously record air temperature and humidity.</description>

    <description>Once the setup of the study sensors is complete, clinical and physiological data will be continuously acquired for a longer monitoring period - i.e., 96 consecutive hours. In addition, photographs of the skin at the site of placement of the sensors will be taken at baseline, 24h and 96h. The research team will also measure respirations using uncalibrated RIP belts at the level of the chest and abdomen (2 to 3 continuous hours each day). Two respiratory bands will be placed circumferentially around the infant's chest and around the abdomen in order to measure chest and abdominal wall movements, respectively.&#xD;
