  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currents strategies for cancer diagnosis consist of the extraction of a solid tissue from the&#xD;
      affected area. This sample enables the study of specific biomarkers and the genetic nature of&#xD;
      the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the tissue extraction is risky and painful for the patient and in some cases is&#xD;
      unavailable in inaccessible tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, cancer is a dynamic disease and during the course of disease, cancers generally&#xD;
      become more heterogeneous. As a result of this heterogeneity, the bulk tumour might include a&#xD;
      diverse collection of cells harbouring distinct molecular signatures with differential levels&#xD;
      of sensitivity to treatment. This heterogeneity might result in a non-uniform distribution of&#xD;
      genetically distinct tumour-cell subpopulations across and within disease sites (spatial&#xD;
      heterogeneity) or temporal variations in the molecular makeup of cancer cells (temporal&#xD;
      heterogeneity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To overcome these drawbacks, new alternatives are rising up, such as liquid biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A liquid biopsy is the analysis of biomarkers in a non-solid biological tissue, mainly blood,&#xD;
      which has remarkable advantages over the traditional method; it has no risk, it is&#xD;
      non-invasive and painless, it does not require surgery and reduces cost and diagnosis time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of the various circulating biomarkers, circulating tumor cells (CTCs) have particularly&#xD;
      opened new windows. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are released into the bloodstream from&#xD;
      primary cancer, metastasis, and even from a disseminated tumor cell reservoir.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CTCs may ideally replace tissue biopsies in the prediction and monitoring of therapeutic&#xD;
      responses and tumor recurrence. CTCs can be used to guide therapeutic cancer management and&#xD;
      serve as drug targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are a wide range of instruments and methods for capturing, enriching, and enumerating&#xD;
      CTCs. However, none of them is considered optimal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To improve the purity of CTCs, the study consortium has developed a cutting-edge microfluidic&#xD;
      device (LUTON) to reduce leukocytes contamination while preserving CTCs viability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The added-value of the study innovation has been validated on clinical cell lines. The aim of&#xD;
      this study is now to determine the performance of the device using patients' blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this purpose, CTCs from non-small cell lung metastatic cancer patients will be isolated&#xD;
      using ClearCellFX1 before injection into the LUTON workflow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collected cells will then be either growth in vitro or in ovo and the added value of this&#xD;
      extra step of purification determined.&#xD;
