  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although the Covid-19 infection mainly manifests itself with respiratory symptoms, as early&#xD;
      as two months after the onset of the pandemic, the presence of other symptoms, including&#xD;
      muscle ones, became clear. With the disappearance of the emergency and the advancement of&#xD;
      knowledge, medium- and long-term effects have been reported at the level of different organs&#xD;
      and systems. Many patients, after several months from infection, report intolerance to&#xD;
      exercise and many suffer from pain and muscle weakness. No studies has been carried out on&#xD;
      the muscular consequences of the infection and on their possible contribution to intolerance&#xD;
      to exercise. Since skeletal muscle possesses the ACE2 receptor (Angiotensin converting enzyme&#xD;
      2) to which SARS-Cov-2 binds, it follows that the involvement of the skeletal muscle could be&#xD;
      due not only to the secondary effects of the infection (e.g. reduced oxygen supply from&#xD;
      persistent lung disease, perfusion defects from cardiovascular defects and vascular damage),&#xD;
      but also to the direct action of virus (SARS-Cov-2 myositis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general purpose of the research is to quantify the spread of symptoms and signs of muscle&#xD;
      weakness and pain among the patient population welcomed at the Cardiorespiratory&#xD;
      Rehabilitation Department of the Alexandria Hospital which have been suffering from&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2, being discharged and healed for more than two months, and define the possible&#xD;
      contribution of muscular modifications to exercise intolerance.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exercise intolerance and muscle weakness have important consequences on the quality of life&#xD;
      of healed patients and significant clinical implications: increased risk of falls and bone&#xD;
      fractures, physical deconditioning and increased risk of chronic lung impairment and other&#xD;
      diseases. Physical deconditioning and muscle weakness are, in fact, among the recognized&#xD;
      risks of chronic pathologies. The identification of any covid-19 myopathy and its&#xD;
      pathogenesis it would be of great importance to define adequate measures to counter it, for&#xD;
      example through the prescription of physical exercise, limit the clinical consequences,&#xD;
      improve the quality of life for many patients and decrease the cost for the National Health&#xD;
      System. The present study aims to assess the frequency of easy fatigue, weakness and muscle&#xD;
      pain in the population at the time of the onset of SARS-CoV-2 infection and after 2-3 months&#xD;
      after healing. Moreover, as secondary outcome, it will evaluate the presence of objective&#xD;
      signs of muscle involvement of theSARS-CoV-2 infections 2-3 months after recovery,&#xD;
      quantifying the presence of myopathic structural changes and the causes of any muscle damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a pilot single center clinical study, with non-pharmacological intervention,&#xD;
      aimed at improve of clinical practice as an integral part of non-purpose health care&#xD;
      industrial companies in accordance with the D.M. 17-12-2004 (No-Profit Trial).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The screening of eligible patients will be carried out by consulting the records paper-based&#xD;
      clinics of patients belonging to the SSD Cardiorespiratory Rehabilitation of the Hospital of&#xD;
      SS Antonio and Biagio and Cesare Arrigo in Alessandria. To eligible patients will be then&#xD;
      submitted the information and consent document to participate in the study during the routine&#xD;
      outpatient visits planned for these subjects. If following the explanations of the&#xD;
      Investigator regarding the experimentation and evaluation of the document informative the&#xD;
      patient decides to join the study and proceed with the following phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In-vivo physiological evaluation will be performed in suitable premises of the Center&#xD;
      Interdepartmental Research Department of Biology and Sports Medicine of the University of&#xD;
      Pavia equipped with the necessary equipment for first aid and in the presence of a doctor&#xD;
      specialist in cardiology or related disciplines, with constant monitoring of vital parameters&#xD;
      (arterial saturation, blood pressure and heart rate) and signal 12-lead electrocardiography.&#xD;
      It will consist of an incremental cycle ergometer test until exhaustion; exhaustion will be&#xD;
      defined by the patient's inability to maintain an adequate pedaling frequency, from reaching&#xD;
      an equal heart rate value at least 85% of the predicted maximum heart rate or from a&#xD;
      perception level fatigue (Borg scale) greater than 17. Patients will be asked before the&#xD;
      assessment to become familiar with the instrumentation and with the researchers involved, by&#xD;
      making briefs evidence. In the event that the patient / control subject complains of symptoms&#xD;
      of fatigue, headache, dizziness, precordialgia or increased blood pressure during the&#xD;
      exercise, this will be immediately suspended. In the presence of cardiovascular diseases or&#xD;
      internist or in any case of serious general conditions the patient / control subject will not&#xD;
      be enrolled in the study. Incremental testing and physiological assessments are used by&#xD;
      several years from the research group of Physiology both on healthy volunteers and on&#xD;
      patients with different pathologies (patients with neuromuscular pathologies, patients with&#xD;
      heart failure, heart transplant patients, bronchopneumopathic patients) with no evidence of&#xD;
      events adverse (Lanfranconi et al., 2006; Grassi et al., 2009; Marzorati et al., 2012a;&#xD;
      Marzorati et al., 2012b; Mezzani et al., 2012; Mezzani et al., 2013; Grassi et al., 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the physiological assessment tests the following measurements will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. determination of pulmonary ventilation (VE), oxygen consumption (VO2) e of the&#xD;
           production of carbon dioxide (VCO2) breath by breath by calorimetry indirect (Vyntus,&#xD;
           Carefusion);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. detection of heart rate (HR) by electrocardiographic signal at 12 derivations&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. determination of systolic (Gs) and cardiac (Q) output by impedance analysis&#xD;
           trans-thoracic (Physioflow, Manatec Biomedical);&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. measurements of the concentration of lactic acid ([La] b) in 20 microliters of capillary&#xD;
           blood obtained from the earlobe or fingertip of the hand (Biosen C-line, EKF) at rest&#xD;
           and after exercise;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. determination of oxygenation modifications of the vastus lateral muscle ([deoxy (Hb +&#xD;
           Mb)]) estimated by quasi-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS, Portamon, Artinis). Moreover,&#xD;
           immediately after a knee flexion-extension exercise a series of 10-18 short (5-10s)&#xD;
           occlusions using a pressure cuff applied to the root of the thigh. To minimize the&#xD;
           discomfort of the study participants two successive occlusions will be separated by a&#xD;
           time interval of 5s-20s (for example 5s for occlusions from 1 to 5, 10s for occlusions&#xD;
           from 6 to 10, 15-20s for occlusions from 11 to 15). A transient interruption of blood&#xD;
           flow will be performed in order to achieve complete deoxygenation at the level of the&#xD;
           investigated muscle (maximum time 3 minutes). The level-positioned NIRS probe of the&#xD;
           vastus lateral muscle will allow to estimate the maximum oxidative capacity of the&#xD;
           muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, to evaluate some muscular contractile properties, 3 maximum voluntary contractions&#xD;
      (MVC) lasting 5 seconds will be required. Each contraction will be separated from the&#xD;
      subsequent by an adequate recovery period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle biopsies will be performed at the Salvatore Maugeri IRCCS Foundation in Pavia&#xD;
      (performed by Dr. Danilo Miotti) or at the Cardiorespiratory Rehabilitation SSD of the&#xD;
      Alessandria Hospital (performed by Dr. Biagio Polla) through the concotome tool. Muscle&#xD;
      biopsy used routinely for the diagnosis of pathologies muscles in neurology and, for decades&#xD;
      now, for the study of physiological adaptations and pathological changes in human skeletal&#xD;
      muscle. The human research projects of Muscle Plasticity Laboratory of the Department of&#xD;
      Molecular Medicine used, with no evidence of adverse events, hundreds of biopsies obtained&#xD;
      from healthy young subjects, sedentary and trained subjects, elderly subjects, subjects&#xD;
      undergoing drug treatment (steroids), pneumopathic subjects in collaboration with ICS-Maugeri&#xD;
      Pavia since 1994.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analyzes on the biopsy material will be performed at the Department of Medicine Molecular&#xD;
      of the University of Pavia, Human Physiology unit, Plasticity laboratory muscle, with the aim&#xD;
      of evaluating the presence of a myopathic condition with modification quantitative and / or&#xD;
      qualitative of skeletal muscle tissue. The laboratory has a vast experience in obtaining and&#xD;
      analyzing human biopsy tissue having developed this approach among the first at an&#xD;
      international level since 1996.&#xD;

    <description>The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state.</description>
