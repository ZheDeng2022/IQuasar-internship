      Part I (Clinical trial setting): A single-arm phase II study to investigate the efficacy of&#xD;
      neoadjuvant atezolizumab (T) + bevacizumab (A) in patients with potentially resectable BCLC&#xD;
      stage B/C or high risk resectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (n = 45)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part II (Biomarker study setting): Exploratory translational research will be conducted using&#xD;
