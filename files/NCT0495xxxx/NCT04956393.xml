  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescents and young adults who hurt their knees playing sports or doing recreational&#xD;
      activities can develop joint damage, muscle weakness, inactivity, and weight gain which might&#xD;
      lead to an increased risk of osteoarthritis (OA), a disabling joint condition in their later&#xD;
      lives. Despite knowing that muscles and joints benefit from exercise, there is no proven&#xD;
      exercise-based treatments to delay or even halt the onset of OA after a knee joint injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study will assess if a physiotherapist-guided intervention called Stop&#xD;
      OsteoARthritis (SOAR) improves knee muscle strength, physical inactivity, knee-related&#xD;
      self-efficacy, and knee-related quality of life in people at risk for osteoarthritis due to a&#xD;
      past knee injury. A total of 70 former knee injury participants will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      two groups. One group will immediately start a 16-week SOAR program, while the second will&#xD;
      wait for 9-weeks before starting an 8-week SOAR program. Trained physiotherapists will&#xD;
      deliver the SOAR program with videoconferencing. The study hypothesis is that participating&#xD;
      in the 8-Week SOAR program will improve the knee muscle strength, physical activity levels,&#xD;
      knee-related self-efficacy and knee-related quality of life in people discharged from regular&#xD;
      healthcare after a sports knee injury. The findings will help researchers understand the&#xD;
      ideal length of the program for a future clinical trial in real-world settings.&#xD;

      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a novel, virtually delivered, PT-guided, knee health&#xD;
      program (Stop OsteoARthritis - SOAR) for people who have been discharged from regular&#xD;
      healthcare after a sports knee injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The primary objective of the study is to assess the efficacy of an 8-week SOAR program&#xD;
           to improve knee muscle strength measured by computerized dynamometry (primary outcome&#xD;
           and daily average moderate to vigorous physical activity measured by Tri-axial&#xD;
           Accelerometer (secondary outcome), self-reported knee-specific self-efficacy (secondary&#xD;
           outcome), and self-reported knee-related quality of life (secondary outcome) in people&#xD;
           discharged from regular care after sports knee trauma. Several exploratory outcomes will&#xD;
           also be assessed to inform the design of a future clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of a protocol for a&#xD;
           future full-scale clinical trial to assess the effectiveness and implementation of SOAR.&#xD;
           Both SOAR program and study protocol implementation and practicality outcomes will be&#xD;
           collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A third objective of this study is to inform the optimal length of the SOAR program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. A fourth, exploratory objective, of this study, is to explore the experiences of&#xD;
           stakeholders (i.e., knee injury participants and physiotherapists) to inform future&#xD;
           implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a proof-of-concept, two-armed, open-label, randomized delayed control trial with&#xD;
      embedded 1:1 interviews. In this design, randomization determines when the intervention is&#xD;
      provided (immediate or 9-week delay). Consenting eligible knee injury participants will be&#xD;
      randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to immediate intervention (experimental) or delayed&#xD;
      intervention (control) groups using a computer-generated sequence of random numbers.&#xD;
      Consenting eligible and physiotherapists will complete Brief Action Planning certification&#xD;
      and SOAR training before delivering the SOAR program virtually to the knee injury&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The immediate study group will be complete an 8-week (weeks 1-8) SOAR program (Knee Camp,&#xD;
      home-based exercise-therapy and physical activity with tracking, weekly 1:1 PT counseling&#xD;
      sessions, and optional weekly group-based exercise classes) followed by an additional 8 weeks&#xD;
      (weeks 10-17) of home-based exercise-therapy and physical activity with tracking, weekly 1:1&#xD;
      PT counseling sessions, and optional weekly group-based exercise classes. In contrast, after&#xD;
      a 9-week delay, the delayed study group will complete an 8-week (weeks 10-17) intervention&#xD;
      (Knee Camp, home-based exercise-therapy and physical activity with tracking, weekly 1:1 PT&#xD;
      counseling sessions, and optional weekly group-based exercise classes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knee injury participant outcomes will be evaluated at baseline (T0), 9-weeks (T1-primary&#xD;
      endpoint to assess efficacy), and 18-weeks (T2- endpoint to inform optimal intervention&#xD;
      length).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physiotherapist participants will be evaluated prior to training, immediately after training,&#xD;
      and after they have delivered the SOAR program to all knee injury participants that they have&#xD;
      been assigned in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be calculated for all demographic variables, and observed&#xD;
      differences (sex, prior injury, injury type, prior treatment, etc.) considered when&#xD;
      interpreting findings. Randomization integrity will be monitored. Outcomes will be&#xD;
      disaggregated by sex and gender, and mean differences between T0 and T1, and T1 and T2&#xD;
      described by the study group. Intention-to-treat analyses will be conducted. Generalized&#xD;
      linear mixed-effects regression models for longitudinal data (95%CI), controlling for the&#xD;
      blocking effect, will estimate the effect of an 8-week intervention (IG T1-T0 versus DG&#xD;
      T1-T0, and DG T2-T1 versus T1-T0) and the delay (IG T1-T0 versus DG T2-T1) for the primary&#xD;
      outcome (Figure 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, two exploratory analyses will be conducted. To inform the optimal intervention&#xD;
      length for the future clinical trial, a longitudinal mixed-effects model will be used to&#xD;
      examine the intervention effect at 16-week. This model will include the following fixed&#xD;
      effects: 1) the randomization group indicator for baseline difference; 2) indicator variables&#xD;
      for follow-up assessment time points (9-week and 18-week) to account for secular trend, and;&#xD;
      3) indicator variables for the lengths of time since intervention initiation (9-week or&#xD;
      18-week) to estimate effects after these time intervals. The model will also include&#xD;
      participant-specific random effects to account for repeated measures. To inform the most&#xD;
      meaningful muscle function outcome for the future clinical trial linear regression (95%CI)&#xD;
      models, adjusted for age and sex, will be used to identify differences in the association&#xD;
      between various aspects of knee extensor muscle function (torque, power, rate of force&#xD;
      development), and composite self-reported knee symptoms and function score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interview recordings with knee injury participants and physiotherapist participants will be&#xD;
      transcribed verbatim and de-identified. Using a constant comparative approach data will be&#xD;
      coded and categories developed by comparing and determining meaningful patterns across codes.&#xD;
      High-order themes will illuminate the relationship between categories. Uniqueness in&#xD;
      experience by gender will be explored and if identified, data will be reanalyzed in gender&#xD;
      sub-groups. A detailed audit of analytic decisions will be kept.&#xD;

    <description>At the end of the study, semi-structured 1:1 interviews will be conducted with a sub-sample of 15-20 knee injury participants. Using an inductive approach and interview guide, participants will be asked open-ended queries about their experiences with the intervention (SOAR program). Interviews will last approximately 45 minutes.</description>

    <description>A bespoke online survey will assess physiotherapists' overall confidence to deliver the intervention (SOAR program) including Brief Action Planning, SMART goal setting, and virtual physiotherapy delivery. Participants will be asked to rate their overall confidence on a 0-10 point numerical rating scale where 0 represents no confidence and 10 represents full confidence. The score will be transformed to a score between 0 and100, with higher scores indicating higher confidence. The survey will take 3 minutes to complete.</description>

    <description>Participants with a past sport-related knee injury randomized to the 'delayed intervention' group will have a 9-week unstandardized delay before completing an 8-week SOAR program (weeks 10-17). During the delay (weeks 1-9) the delay comparison intervention will be unstandardized to reflect usual care in Canada. After the 9-week delay, these participants will complete an 8-week (weeks 10-17) SOAR program (Knee Camp, home-based exercise-therapy and physical activity with tracking, weekly 1:1 PT counseling sessions, and an optional weekly group-based exercise classes). Consented trained physiotherapists will deliver the SOAR program from week 10 to week 17 to one or more delayed SOAR group knee injury participants.</description>
