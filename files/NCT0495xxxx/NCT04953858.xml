    <textblock>
      UNAIDS aims to end AIDS by 2030 using &quot;90-90-90&quot; diagnosis-treatment-viral suppression&#xD;
      targets. Thailand has achieved elimination of HIV mother-to-child transmission, but continues&#xD;
      to see new infections among adolescent men who have sex with men (YMSM) and transgender women&#xD;
      (YTGW). Reaching and engagement of key populations to HIV services remains a major challenge,&#xD;
      with differentiated care needed to address this. Investigators propose a study on outreach&#xD;
      for HIV at-risk adolescents using peer-led social network strategies (SNS), linkage to&#xD;
      facility-based HIV self-testing, and same day HIV prevention or treatment. The study will&#xD;
      focus on the 15-19 year age group who have the highest HIV incidence in Thailand (6.9-10 per&#xD;
      100 person years, PY), but will also include young adults aged 20- 24 years of age, due to&#xD;
      their frequently intertwining sex networks and very similar HIV incidence of 4.9-7.2 per 100&#xD;
      PY.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eight hundred adolescent and young adult (AYA) MSM and TGW aged between 15-24 years will be&#xD;
      recruited into a double HIV cascade care system. AYA aged between 15-24 years will be trained&#xD;
      as recruiters to approach and refer their peers, 'network members' (NMs) to our adolescent&#xD;
      clinic. NMs will be offered a choice of either blood-based or oral fluid-based HIV&#xD;
      self-testing. HIV positive cases will be offered same-day antiretroviral therapy (SDART) and&#xD;
      high-risk adolescents will be offered same day preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP). The project&#xD;
      will be conducted at adolescent differentiated care services previously established by CIPHER&#xD;
      grants in Thailand, located at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital (KCMH), Bangkok. It will&#xD;
      inform both Thailand and other Asia-Pacific region countries with similar epidemic patterns&#xD;
      through an implementation research lens on strategies to engage YMSM and YTGW into HIV&#xD;
      services, which investigators believe will make high-impact contributions to our collective&#xD;
      ultimate goal of ending AIDS.&#xD;

    <measure>The effectiveness of using social network strategies to increase HIV testing uptake in YMSM and YTGW.</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Effectiveness will be measured by proportion of first-time testers among participants enrolled, defined as number of first-time testers divided by total number enrolled. SNS strategies are considered effective when proportions exceed 50 percent. Descriptive statistics of first-time tester characteristics, HIV risk factors, and their recruiter's characteristics will be described.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) uptake among HIV negative at-risk adolescents</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>PrEP uptake is defined as the number of participants agreeing to initiate PrEP divided by the total number of HIV negative participants enrolled and association of PrEP uptake with factors include recruiter's characteristics will be evaluated utilizing logistic regression to calculate odd ratios and 95 percent confident intervals.</description>

    <description>Proportions of viral suppression seen at 6 months for those initiated on antiretroviral treatment among newly diagnosed HIV positive adolescents will be calculated. Descriptive statistics will used to describe this group of the sample. Comparison of characteristics between those viral suppressed and not virally suppressed will be performed.</description>
