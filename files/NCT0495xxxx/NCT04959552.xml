    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized, single-arm study intended to&#xD;
      characterize the safety of the FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash Glucose Monitoring System when used to&#xD;
      manage diabetes in a pediatric patient population.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 400 subjects aged 4-17 years and older with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, who&#xD;
      require daily blood glucose monitoring to manage their diabetes will be enrolled in the&#xD;
      study. Subjects and/or their caregivers will utilize he FreeStyle Libre 2 Flash Glucose&#xD;
      Monitoring System for managing diabetes for 6 months. Subjects and/or their caregivers will&#xD;
      maintain a diary/log book of Adverse Events experienced during the duration of the study.&#xD;
      Assessment of Adverse Events will occur via self reporting at each monthly visit and/or phone&#xD;
      call.&#xD;
