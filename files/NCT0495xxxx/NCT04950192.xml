  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this observational registry is to report real-world safety and performance of&#xD;
      VeriSight for ultrasound guided ICE imaging in percutaneous cardiac intervention procedures&#xD;
      when used in standard clinical practice.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, observational, single-arm registry intended to gather&#xD;
      real-world data to report VeriSight ICE catheter performance and safety. It will be conducted&#xD;
      in the United States under the approval of one or more recognized institutional review boards&#xD;
      and in compliance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines defined in International Standards&#xD;
      Organization:14155;2011, the Declaration of Helsinki, and all applicable federal and local&#xD;
      laws and regulations. Only on label uses of the VeriSight ICE catheter will be allowed. No&#xD;
      specific claims are being validated during this registry, though data analyzed from this&#xD;
      protocol are intended to inform of future claims regarding the performance and safety of the&#xD;
      VeriSight catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled patients will be imaged with VeriSight for various types of percutaneous cardiac&#xD;
      interventional procedures. Enrolled subjects will be followed until discharge or ≤48 hrs&#xD;
      post-procedure. The registry has a planned duration of approximately 24-36 months with&#xD;
      interim analysis planned at 100 patients before further enrollment will be considered.&#xD;
      Statistical hypotheses are not intended for this registry and descriptive analysis will be&#xD;
      conducted. Data from all clinical sites are intended to be pooled for analysis. It is&#xD;
      possible that sub-analyses may be conducted to demonstrate VeriSight guidance for target&#xD;
      intervention types in structural heart and electrophysiology procedures.&#xD;
