  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project seeks to understand if a new self-help mobile phone application (called&#xD;
      MyMoodCoach) is effective at reducing worry and overthinking, prominent risk factors that&#xD;
      predict reduced well-being and poor mental health. As a primary outcome, the investigators&#xD;
      are predicting that people who use the app will report more significant reductions on&#xD;
      measures of overthinking than those who do not. The investigators also predict that people&#xD;
      who use the app will report more significant reductions in measures of worry as well as&#xD;
      reported symptoms of depression and anxiety. Further, it is predicted that people who use the&#xD;
      app will report a significantly higher increase in their well-being compared to those who do&#xD;
      not.&#xD;

      The Emotional Competence for Well-Being in Young Adults study has developed an emotional&#xD;
      competence app to be examined via cohort multiple randomised controlled trial (cmRCT) in a&#xD;
      longitudinal prospective cohort. This off-shoot study adapts the app to focus on targeting&#xD;
      worry and overthinking (also known as rumination), which are prominent risk factors for poor&#xD;
      mental health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within this study, 16-24-year-olds in the UK, who report elevated worry and rumination on&#xD;
      standardised questionnaires are randomised to either receive the mobile phone app immediately&#xD;
      or to receive the app after a wait of 6 weeks. In total, the study will aim to recruit 204&#xD;
      participants across the UK. Assessments take place at baseline (pre-randomisation), 6 and 12&#xD;
      weeks post-randomisation. Primary endpoint for the study is the change in levels of&#xD;
      rumination assessed at 6 weeks after randomisation. Worry, depressive symptoms, anxiety&#xD;
      symptoms and well-being are secondary outcomes. Compliance, adverse events, and potentially&#xD;
      mediating variables will be carefully monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial aims to provide a better understanding of the benefits of tackling rumination and&#xD;
      worry via an intervention delivered via mobile phone app with respect to promoting well-being&#xD;
      and preventing poor mental health in young people. This prevention mechanism trial will&#xD;
      establish whether targeting worry and rumination directly via an app provides a feasible&#xD;
      approach to prevent depression and anxiety, with scope to become a widescale public health&#xD;
      strategy for preventing poor mental health and promoting well-being in young people.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The trial design is of a superiority two-arm parallel-group single-blind randomised controlled trial comparing usual practice plus up to 6 weeks of using the repetitive negative thinking-targeting digital self-help app versus usual practice and waiting list control. The primary hypothesis is that the rumination-targeting digital self-help app will reduce rumination and worry significantly more than waiting list control at 6 weeks follow-up.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The self-help app includes self-monitoring, psychoeducation and active self-help exercises. The self-monitoring includes daily mood ratings and an ecological momentary assessment option (MoodTracker) for more detailed analysis of mood, worry, activity and situational context. The digital self-help provides psychoeducation, tips, advice, exercises and training for each individual focused on reducing worry and rumination, using strategies from the proven rumination-focused CBT intervention. The app includes text, pictures, audio-recordings, animations, audio-exercises to practice (e.g., self-compassion, relaxation, concreteness exercises), and questionnaires with tailored feedback. The app is designed for iOS and Android use.</description>
