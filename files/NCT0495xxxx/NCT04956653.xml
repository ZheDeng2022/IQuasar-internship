      Objectives: To explore the correlation of the incidence and social characteristics in&#xD;
      patients withspinal degenerative diseases (SDD), and to provide certain evidence for&#xD;
      prevention, treatment and incidencecontrol of the disease. Methods: Data between January 1,&#xD;
      2003 to December 31, 2016 were collected from electronic medical documents of the orthopedic&#xD;
      department, including patients who suffered from SDD, treated by operation for the first time&#xD;
      and aged 18 years old or over. Descriptive statistics and Chi-square test were used to&#xD;
      analyze the correlation of social characteristics of patients（eg. age, gender, career, place&#xD;
      of birth, nationality and comorbidities）and the degenerative spinal diseases.&#xD;
