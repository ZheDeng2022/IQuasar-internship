      Although smoking has been proposed as well, as a risk factor/indicator for peri-implantitis,&#xD;
      there is currently no conclusive evidence. The current literature confronts the inconclusive&#xD;
      evidence of tobacco for a risk factor. Therefore, the aim of the present investigation is to&#xD;
      determine the association between tobacco and peri-implantitis in sample of patients who had&#xD;
      received therapy implant-supported restorative therapy in a university setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study was designed as a retrospective case control study in a sample of patients&#xD;
      with implant-supported restorative therapy 7-19 years after restorative phase. The study was&#xD;
      conducted at the Clinica Universitaria d'Odontologia (CUO) in the Universitat Internacional&#xD;
      de Catalunya (UIC) for 1 month and was performed following the principles outlined in the&#xD;
      Declaration of Helsinki (revised, amended, and clarified in 2013. Prior to enrol the study a&#xD;
      written informed consent was signed. Patients provided with implant-supported restorative&#xD;
      therapy between 2001-2013 was selected from the UIC database. The sample was divided in three&#xD;
      groups: healthy patients, patients with mucositis and patients with peri-implantitis. During&#xD;
      the examination, the clinician reviewed with the patient the Information and Medication&#xD;
      History Forms and record the anthropometric, socio-demographic and clinical information. An&#xD;
      initial questionnaire was conducted to obtain information regarding age, gender, medical&#xD;
      history, medication, and health behaviour. Candidates underwent an oral pathology examination&#xD;
      and a full-mouth probing using a standardize pressure (20N) probe SONDA PA_ON (Orange&#xD;
      Dental®, Aspachstr, Biberach, Germany) to determine their periodontal and peri-implant&#xD;
      status. All statistical analyses were performed with the package RStudio (V2.5). Descriptive&#xD;
      characteristics regarding all the covariates were summarized. Periimplant bone loss (95%&#xD;
      Confidence Interval - 95% CI) were calculated both at implant- and at patient-level. A&#xD;
      multilevel regression model will be applied to evaluate the influence of some risk/protective&#xD;
      indicators on the risk for peri-implant bone loss. Risk/protective indicators for&#xD;
      periimplantitis will be studied using multilevel (mixed-effects) multivariate regression&#xD;
      analyses (patient- and implant-level). Each potential indicator was tested individually by&#xD;
      adding it to an empty model having as dependent variable the peri-implant status and testing&#xD;
      the significance.&#xD;

      1. Introduction Nowadays, dental implants are a good restorative option for those patients&#xD;
           who have lost one or more teeth in order to re-establish function and aesthetics.&#xD;
           Nevertheless, dental implants are not free of suffering complications and disease.&#xD;
           Peri-implant diseases are inflammatory conditions affecting the tissues surrounding the&#xD;
           bone anchored implants, triggered by the presence of peri-implant biofilms in&#xD;
           susceptible individuals (Rinke et al., 2011; Roos-Jansåker, Lindahl, et al., 2006;&#xD;
           Roos-Jansåker, Renvert, et al., 2006; Schwarz et al., 2017)(Roos-Jansåker, Lindahl, et&#xD;
           al., 2006; Roos-Jansåker, Renvert, et al., 2006; Schwarz et al., 2017)(Merli et al.,&#xD;
           2014). At the New World Workshop in Periodontology (2017) these terms were revised and&#xD;
           it was concluded that peri-implant mucositis is the presence of reversible inflammatory&#xD;
           changes in the mucosa around an implant with no signs of loss of supporting bone, while&#xD;
           peri-implantitis is the condition of inflammation of the peri-implant tissues involving&#xD;
           loss of supporting bone (Renvert et al., 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Peri-implant diseases are prevalent, and its presence has increased over time. As it is&#xD;
           reported in the Swedish population, peri-implant mucositis appears in 32% of the&#xD;
           patients, whereas peri-implantitis was observed in 45% of the patients (Derks et al.,&#xD;
           2016). In addition, a cross-sectional study Spain revealed the presence of peri-implant&#xD;
           mucositis in the 24% of patients, while peri-implantitis was found in the 18% (Rodrigo&#xD;
           et al., 2018). For that high percentage of peri-implantitis, it seems reasonable to do a&#xD;
           patient-specific risk assessment for implant therapy, and there is a clear need to&#xD;
           identify an effective method to prevent peri-implant infections. According to the New&#xD;
           World Workshop on Periodontology there is strong evidence that history of periodontitis,&#xD;
           poor plaque control and lack of regular maintenance is a risk factor for&#xD;
           peri-implantitis (Renvert et al., 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Regarding tobacco, there is scientific evidence that affirms it is a risk factor for the&#xD;
           periodontal disease progression and its effect on biofilm (Winkelhoff et al., 2001),&#xD;
           host response (Palmer et al., 2005), wound healing and periodontal treatment success&#xD;
           (Bunæs et al., 2015; Fisher et al., 2008; Kotsakis et al., 2015). It has been reported&#xD;
           more presence of some periodontopathogens in smokers in comparison to non-smokers such&#xD;
           as B forsythia, P micros, F nucleatum and C rectus; an effect on neutrophil's function,&#xD;
           lymphocytes and on the vasculature of the periodontal tissues (Palmer et al., 2005)&#xD;
           being more predisposed to periodontal breakdown and recurrence (Bunæs et al., 2015;&#xD;
           Fisher et al., 2008; Kotsakis et al., 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Although smoking has been proposed as well, as a risk factor/indicator for&#xD;
           peri-implantitis, there is currently no conclusive evidence. The current literature&#xD;
           confronts the inconclusive evidence of tobacco for a risk factor. Studies by Schwarz,&#xD;
           Roos-Jansaker or Rinke concluded that smoking habit has 2.7 to 31 times more probability&#xD;
           to cause peri-implantitis with Odds Ratio (OR) ranging from 2.7 to 31.6 respectively&#xD;
           (Rinke et al., 2011; Roos-Jansåker, Lindahl, et al., 2006; Roos-Jansåker, Renvert, et&#xD;
           al., 2006; Schwarz et al., 2017)Furthermore, it has been reported by Karoussis and&#xD;
           coworkers an incidence of peri-implant diseases of 6% in non-smokers vs 17,9% in&#xD;
           smokers. The biologic processes involved in osseointegration and maintenance of&#xD;
           peri-implant bone levels could be likely affected by tobacco smoking(Karoussis et al.,&#xD;
           2003). However, most of the literature shows (Aguirre-Zorzano et al., 2015; ALHarthi et&#xD;
           al., 2018; Canullo et al., 2016; Casado et al., 2013; Dalago et al., 2017; Daubert et&#xD;
           al., 2015; de Araújo Nobre et al., 2015; Dvorak et al., 2011; Koldsland et al., 2010,&#xD;
           2011; Marrone et al., 2013; Máximo et al., 2008; Rokn et al., 2017) that there is no&#xD;
           association between tobacco smoking and peri-implant diseases . Stacchi and coworkers&#xD;
           concluded that there were no sufficient data to assess the role of smoking as a risk&#xD;
           factor for implant loss and peri-implantitis. Both implant and patient-based&#xD;
           meta-analyses revealed a significantly higher risk of developing peri-implantitis in&#xD;
           patients with a history of periodontitis compared with periodontally healthy subjects,&#xD;
           but not a statistically significant increased risk for implant loss (Stacchi et al.,&#xD;
           2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Tobacco contains thousands of different substances and most of them represent harmful&#xD;
           effects resulted from the systemic exposure following lung absorption. It also has&#xD;
           effects on the oral microbiota, the gingival tissues, the inflammatory and immune&#xD;
           response, and the healing capacity of the periodontium (Palmer et al., 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Tobacco smoking enhances peri-implant soft tissue inflammation and crestal bone loss&#xD;
           around immediate loading and delayed implants (Al Amri et al., 2017). ALHarthi et al,&#xD;
           studied the peri-implant plaque index, bleeding on probing and probing depth as a&#xD;
           peri-implant soft tissue parameter and the crestal bone loss in cigarettes smokers (CS),&#xD;
           waterpipe smokers (WS) and non-smokers (NS). Peri-implant soft tissue inflammatory&#xD;
           parameters and crestal bone loss are worse in CS and WS compared with NS. There was no&#xD;
           difference in these parameters among the different way of smoking (ALHarthi et al.,&#xD;
           2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
           It has also been demonstrated that tobacco smoke inhibits the proliferation and/or&#xD;
           function of B and T cells. Macrophages play important roles in the both cell-mediated&#xD;
           and humoral immunity as antigens cells. It has been shown that alveolar macrophages from&#xD;
           smokers exhibit reduced expression of Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC). This may&#xD;
           eventually lead to a reduction in the humoral immune response to invading organisms&#xD;
           (Palmer et al., 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Background and current status of the topic Recent studies demonstrated that smoking&#xD;
           contributes to the formation of dysbiotic biofilm. Smokers presented deeper probing&#xD;
           depths and bleeding on probing, and peri-implant microbiota was composed of a greater&#xD;
           number of periodontal pathogens than in non-smoking patients (Ata-Ali et al., 2016).&#xD;
           Tsigarida and coworkers studied the influence of smoking on the peri-implant microbiome&#xD;
           concluding microbial signatures of health in smokers exhibited lower density compared to&#xD;
           non-smokers, with significant enrichment for disease associated species (Tsigarida et&#xD;
           al., 2015). Furthermore, it was suggested by Duan and colleagues that tobacco smoking&#xD;
           has a role in creating an at-risk-for-harm microbiome, and further may interfere in bone&#xD;
           healing around the implant (Duan et al., 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The insertion of dental implants in smokers affects the implant failure rates (6.35% in&#xD;
           smokers and 3.18% in non-smokers), the incidence of postoperative infections, as well&#xD;
           as, the marginal bone loss (Chrcanovic et al., 2015). As it can be observed in the&#xD;
           metanalysis of Moraschini and coworkers, there is statistically significant difference&#xD;
           in marginal bone loss between smokers and non-smokers, favouring the non-smoking&#xD;
           patients standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.49. Moreover, there is a statistically&#xD;
           significant difference in implant failure in favour of non-smoking group with OR 1.96&#xD;
           (Moraschini &amp; Barboza, 2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Future studies are required to assess the effect of dose and duration of cigarette&#xD;
           smoking on implant outcomes. Therefore, the aim of the present investigation is to&#xD;
           determine the association between tobacco and peri-implantitis in sample of patients who&#xD;
           had received therapy implant-supported restorative therapy in a university setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Objectives Primary objective To determine the predictive value of tobacco and&#xD;
           periimplantitis in a group of patients treated with implant therapy from 2001 to 2013 in&#xD;
           Clinica Universitària d'Odotntologia de la Universitat Internacional de Catalunya.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
           - To determine the association between tobacco and peri-implant diseases in patients&#xD;
           with implant therapy (2001-2013)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
           There is association between tobacco and periimplant diseases in patients with implant&#xD;
           therapy (2001-2013)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Material and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study design The present study was designed as a retrospective case control study in a&#xD;
           sample of patients with implant-supported restorative therapy 7-19 years after&#xD;
           restorative phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study was conducted at the Clinica Universitaria d'Odontologia (CUO) in the&#xD;
           Universitat Internacional de Catalunya (UIC) for 1 month and was performed following the&#xD;
           principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki (revised, amended, and clarified in&#xD;
           2013. Prior to enrol the study a written informed consent was signed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients that received an implant in the University setting was randomly recruited&#xD;
           consecutively from data base of the Department of Periodontology and Oral Surgery. After&#xD;
           a randomized selection was performed, subjects were contacted by telephone and asked to&#xD;
           participate in the study by one examiner (J. M-A)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study population Patients provided with implant-supported restorative therapy between&#xD;
           2001-2013 was selected from the UIC database. The following inclusion criteria were&#xD;
           considered: (1) men and women over 18 years old, (2) partially or totally edentulous&#xD;
           patients with at least one implant placed at the university and loaded 7-19 years&#xD;
           before, (3) cemented, screwed or mechanically retained prosthesis, (4) single, partial&#xD;
           prostheses, and complete (fixed and removable), (5) patients diagnose of peri-implant&#xD;
           health and peri-implantitis and (6) ability to understand study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The sample was divided in three groups: healthy patients, patients with mucositis and&#xD;
           patients with peri-implantitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sample size calculation Accepting an alpha risk of 0.05 and a beta risk of 0.2 in a&#xD;
           bilateral contrast, 40 cases and 40 controls are required to detect a minimum odds ratio&#xD;
           of 4.6 of having periimplant diseases (Roos-Jansåker, Renvert, et al., 2006). In&#xD;
           addition to these 80 patients between cases and controls, 40 patients with mucositis&#xD;
           were added.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data collection During the examination, the clinician reviewed with the patient the&#xD;
           Information and Medication History Forms and record the anthropometric,&#xD;
           socio-demographic and clinical information. An initial questionnaire was conducted to&#xD;
           obtain information regarding age, gender, medical history, medication, and health&#xD;
           behaviour. Candidates underwent an oral pathology examination and a full-mouth probing&#xD;
           using a standardize pressure (20N) probe SONDA PA_ON (Orange Dental®, Aspachstr,&#xD;
           Biberach, Germany) to determine their periodontal and peri-implant status.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study variables were recorded in a case report form (CRF) specially designed for the&#xD;
           study. Each study patient was assigned a 3-digit patient code (assigned correlatively as&#xD;
           they are included in the study). The parameters regarding implant design and therapy,&#xD;
           restorative treatment and medication were revisited in the medical history and were&#xD;
           recorded by the examiner.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Periodontal disease Each patient was evaluated of periodontal status recording history&#xD;
           of periodontitis, health, active or stable periodontal status, plaque control and&#xD;
           frequency of supportive periodontal care (Papapanou et al., 2018)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Implant characteristics Implants were categorized regarding the brand, the length and&#xD;
           diameter, the implant surface or topography, connection, the installation protocols and&#xD;
           their position in the arch. Bone augmentation procedures and the use of antibiotics&#xD;
           during the therapy were also considered. Moreover, it was recorded the presence of&#xD;
           absence, the date and the cause of implant loss. In terms of restoration, it was&#xD;
           evaluated the type of prosthesis, loading, retention and as well as their cleansable.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Periodontal and radiographic parameters The clinical parameters were recorded by one&#xD;
           examiner (J. M-A) using a periodontal probe SONDA PA_ON (Orange Dental®, Aspachstr,&#xD;
           Biberach, Germany) with a standardized pressure (20N). Probing pocket depths (PDD),&#xD;
           recession (R), modified bleeding on probing (MBP) and modified plaque index (MPI)&#xD;
           (Mombelli et al., 1987) and suppuration.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Periapical radiographs were taken to detect any loss of supporting bone using a&#xD;
           paralleling cone technique and a film-holder (7mA- 60kV/20ms) at re-examination visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Probing depth&#xD;
&#xD;
           - In mm from the implant shoulder till the apical point of the periodontal pocket&#xD;
&#xD;
           Bleeding on probing:&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Presence or absence of bleeding after 30 seconds of probing&#xD;
&#xD;
           Modified bleeding on probing&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Score 0 - no bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Score 1 - isolated bleeding spots visible.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Score 2 - blood forms a confluent red line on margin.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Score 3 - heavy or profuse bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Suppuration on probing&#xD;
&#xD;
           - It evaluated after assessing dichotomously the presence of suppuration within 30&#xD;
           seconds after gentle probing&#xD;
&#xD;
           Modified plaque index&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Score 0 - no detection of plaque.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Score 1 - plaque only recognized by running a probe across the smooth marginal&#xD;
                surface of the implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Score 2 - plaque can be seen by the naked eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Score 3 - abundance of soft matter.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Recession of the mucosal margin&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Relative to the restoration margin (MR) at the implant will be recorded at six aspects&#xD;
           per implant: mb, b, db, ml, l and dl with a resin splint&#xD;
&#xD;
           Definition of peri-implant health The case definition of peri-implant health was based&#xD;
           on absence of clinical inflammation, lack of bleeding on probing and absence of bone&#xD;
           loss following initial healing (&lt; 2mm) (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Definition of peri-implantitis It is based on clinical and radiographic bone loss.&#xD;
           Implants should have clinical inflammation in combination with bleeding on probing&#xD;
           and/or suppuration, also progressive bone loss when compared with baseline radiograph&#xD;
           shall be demonstrable, as well as an increase in probing pocket depth (PPD) from the&#xD;
           baseline examination (Baseline record are referred to those obtained after definitive&#xD;
           prosthesis delivery). In those cases where no baseline records were available, marginal&#xD;
           bone loss &gt; 3mm and probing &gt; 6mm were stated as requirements (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Definition of peri-implant mucositis The case definition of peri-implant mucositis it is&#xD;
           based on clinical inflammation in combination with profuse bleeding on probing and/or&#xD;
           suppuration with increasing of probing pocket depths and absence of bone loss beyond&#xD;
           crestal bone level (initial remodelling) (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Smoking habit Smoking behavior was specified as 3 categories: never smoker, former&#xD;
           smoker, or current smoker. At the same time, current smokers were divided in light (&lt;10&#xD;
           c/d), moderate (11-19 c/d) and heavy (&gt;20 c/d). Patients were asked about their tobacco&#xD;
           smoke exposure in terms of consumption (i.e. the number of cigarettes consumed per day);&#xD;
           duration (i.e. the number of years of smoking); and lifetime exposure (i.e. the&#xD;
           accumulated exposure as formed by the product of consumption and duration:&#xD;
           cigarette/years). In case of former smokers, patients were asked about the smoke free&#xD;
           time following cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Moreover, patients were asked about tobacco type, inhalations and nicotine, as well as&#xD;
           some questions about dependence and motivation (modifications of Fagestrom and Richmond&#xD;
           test) such as: (1) How soon after waking do you smoke your first cigarette?, (2) Do you&#xD;
           find it difficult to refrain from smoking in places where it is forbidden? (3) Which&#xD;
           cigarette would you hate to give up? The first in the morning or any other? (4) Do you&#xD;
           smoke more frequently in the morning? (5) Do you smoke even if you are sick in bed most&#xD;
           of the day? (6) Did you try to quit smoking? And how many times? (7) For you, how is it&#xD;
           difficult to quit smoking?&#xD;
&#xD;
           Calibration The examiner was calibrated in clinical and radiographic parameters. Five&#xD;
           patients apart from the study, with at least one loaded implant were examined in two&#xD;
           separate occasions, 1 week apart. Pocket probing depth and bone level were evaluated,&#xD;
           and Intra-class correlation coefficient and the kappa index were calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study visits&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Screening files All patient files of those who received implant therapy between&#xD;
                2001 and 2007 will be collected from the internal database of the university and&#xD;
                subsequently, will be returned. The patients will be randomly selected using a&#xD;
                computer program of randomization and recruited by phone call until reaching 264&#xD;
                patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Baseline The baseline is settled on the day of the prosthesis delivery. A&#xD;
                periapical radiograph is collected. It was recorded the technique the operators did&#xD;
                and the final radiograoph of the implant pacement, as well as the type of the&#xD;
                implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Re-examination visit (&quot;today visit) A guidebook will be prepared to standardize&#xD;
                procedures throughout the protocol, step by step, for all questionnaires and&#xD;
                evidence collection. The data will be transferred to a computerized database.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The clinician will review with the patient the Information and Medication History Forms&#xD;
           and record the anthropometric, socio-demographic and clinical information. Candidates&#xD;
           will undergo an oral pathology examination and a full-mouth manual probing using a&#xD;
           periodontal probe SONDA PA_ON (Orange Dental®, Aspachstr, Biberach, Germany) to&#xD;
           determine their periodontal and peri-implant status. Clinical and radiographic&#xD;
           examination will be performed. Moreover, signs as presence of suppuration, bleeding,&#xD;
           redness, probing depth must be recorded at 6 sites per implant applying. As well, a&#xD;
           specific survey about tobacco habits including modification of Fagestrom &amp; Richmond test&#xD;
           will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Analysis results All statistical analyses were performed with the package RStudio&#xD;
           (V2.5). Descriptive characteristics regarding all the covariates were summarized.&#xD;
           Periimplant bone loss (95% Confidence Interval - 95% CI) were calculated both at&#xD;
           implant- and at patient-level. A multilevel regression model will be applied to evaluate&#xD;
           the influence of some risk/protective indicators on the risk for peri-implant bone loss.&#xD;
           Risk/protective indicators for periimplantitis will be studied using multilevel&#xD;
           (mixed-effects) multivariate regression analyses (patient- and implant-level). Each&#xD;
           potential indicator was tested individually by adding it to an empty model having as&#xD;
           dependent variable the peri-implant status and testing the significance.&#xD;
