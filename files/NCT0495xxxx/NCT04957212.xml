      This study was a phase III, multicenter, triple-blind, equivalency clinical trial to&#xD;
      determine the therapeutic efficacy and safety between Pertuzumab® (CinnaGen Co.) compared to&#xD;
      originator pertuzumab in HER2-positive early breast cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were stratified dynamically for random assignment to treatment with either&#xD;
      Pertuzumab® (CinnaGen Co.) or originator pertuzumab, and received neoadjuvant TCHP regimen&#xD;

      This study was a phase III, multicenter, triple-blind , equivalency clinical trial to&#xD;
      determine the therapeutic efficacy and safety between Pertuzumab® (CinnaGen Co.) compared to&#xD;
      originator pertuzumab in HER2-positive early breast cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients stratified dynamically according to two factors: type of breast cancer&#xD;
      (inflammatory, locally and operable) and estrogen/ progesterone receptor (ER/PR) (positive or&#xD;
      negative) with 1:1 allocation ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study drugs were administered intravenously on a 3-weekly schedule and were given&#xD;
      consecutively on the same day in the following sequence: trastuzumab, followed by pertuzumab,&#xD;
      carboplatin, and docetaxel (TCHP regimen).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint was breast pCR (bpCR). Secondary efficacy endpoints included total pCR&#xD;
      (tpCR); objective response rate (ORR) and rate of breast-conserving surgery (BCS) for&#xD;
      patients for whom mastectomy was planned before treatment (T2-3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this study, adverse events (AEs) were monitored continuously. As an adverse event of&#xD;
      special interest (AESI), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decreased was monitored&#xD;
      and assessed by echocardiography throughout the study. Immunogenicity was also assessed.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Patients were randomly assigned to treatment by a central randomization procedure via telephone call for each consecutive eligible patient. Randomization codes were allocated after all eligibility criteria were approved, stratification factors were identified and the informed consent form was signed.&#xD;
After randomization procedure, a code was allocated to each patient that was used as patient identifier throughout the study. The assigned code was denoted by 4 initials (corresponding to the 2 first letter of the first name, the 2 first letter of the first surname) and 3 numbers (center code).</masking_description>
