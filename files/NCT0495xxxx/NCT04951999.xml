    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether preserved pulsatility for&#xD;
      patients supported by CF-LVAD (continuous flow Left Ventricular Assist Device) is associated&#xD;
      with less acquired deficiency of the Von Willebrand factor, a blood glycoprotein involved in&#xD;
      hemostasis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Implantation of LVADs (Left Ventricular Assist Device) is a medium to long-term therapeutic&#xD;
      option for patients with end-stage heart failure and isolated left ventricular dysfunction.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, LVADs use remain limited by the frequency of their adverse effects, most of&#xD;
      which being unpredictable. In the literature, loss of pulsatility seems to be associated with&#xD;
      CF-LVADs complications, including bleeding. Accordingly, the primary objective of this study&#xD;
      is to determine whether patient's preserved pulsatility is associated with less acquired&#xD;
      deficiency of the Von Willebrand factor (VWF), a blood glycoprotein involved in hemostasis.&#xD;
      This deficiency, characterized by a decrease or absence of VWF High Molecular Weight&#xD;
      Multimers (HMWMs), is present to varying degrees in almost all patients with LVADs and is a&#xD;
      major risk factor for bleeding complications in these patients. Pulsatility is estimated by&#xD;
      the patient's blood pressure differential, measured 1) at discharge from the operating room&#xD;
      (=transfer to care), 2) at discharge from care (=transfer to his or her room), 3) at&#xD;
      discharge from the hospital (=transfer to rehabilitation), and then at each follow-up visit&#xD;
      up to 6 months post-implantation. The primary endpoint is to determine whether a preserved&#xD;
      pulsatility is associated with less acquired deficiency of the Von Willebrand factor ratio of&#xD;
      High Molecular Weight Multimers (HMWMs).&#xD;

             suitable heart transplant is prolonged while their clinical condition deteriorates&#xD;
             (&quot;Bridge To Transplantation&quot; or BTT situation). Commonly used indicators of disease&#xD;
             deterioration for LVAD implantation include a declining ejection fraction ≤ 25%,&#xD;
             frequent or prolonged hospitalizations due to heart failure, intolerance to heart&#xD;
             failure drug therapies manifested by hypotension or renal failure, and reduced maximal&#xD;
             or submaximal exercise performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
             or&#xD;
&#xD;
             B- Patients who would be candidates for heart transplantation but who have a relative&#xD;
             contraindication at the time of the heart transplant screening visit that may resolve&#xD;
             after a period of &quot;Bridge To Decision&quot; or BTD mechanical circulatory support. These&#xD;
             relative contraindications to heart transplantation include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Active infection (patients with chronic viral infections such as hepatitis B,&#xD;
                  hepatitis C, and HIV may be considered if viral titers are undetectable following&#xD;
                  treatment and without damage to other organs).&#xD;

                  &gt; 7.5%.&#xD;

                  parenchymal lung disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Renal dysfunction with estimated glomerular filtration &lt; 30 ml/min/1.73 m².&#xD;

                  transpulmonary gradient ≥ 15 mmHg and/or pulmonary vascular resistance &gt; 5 Wood&#xD;
                  units. If this pulmonary hypertension is irreversible despite pharmacological&#xD;
                  treatment or mechanical circulatory support, the contraindication to heart&#xD;
                  transplantation becomes absolute.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Psychosocial factors, including history of medication noncompliance, inadequate&#xD;

               -  Current or recent tumor: risk of recurrence should be discussed with the&#xD;
                  oncologist.&#xD;

             circulatory assistance (Bridge To Recovery BTR): patients in cardiogenic shock&#xD;
             following viral myocarditis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients affiliated to a social security system (beneficiaries or beneficiaries&#xD;
             entitled to benefits, excluding AME)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Signature of an informed consent by the patient or by the trusted person, or a close&#xD;
             relative, if the patient is not able to do so&#xD;
