  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lower Limb Amputations (LLAs) are a substantial burden on the Canadian health services with&#xD;
      nearly 50,000 cases reported between 2006 and 2011. To address the challenging nature of a&#xD;
      LLA (e.g., decreased mobility, pain, depression), patients need to go through extensive&#xD;
      rehabilitation programs. Effective self-management programs can help those with LLA to&#xD;
      monitor their own condition and improve their quality of life. However, a lack of&#xD;
      self-management programs, a limited healthcare budget, and a decrease in quality of services&#xD;
      (e.g. shorter lengths of stay for inpatients and rapid movement to outpatient services) pose&#xD;
      further challenges for patients with LLA. Self-management programs can be provided to clients&#xD;
      through online mobile technologies (e.g., tablet) and offer accessible, low-cost, and&#xD;
      potentially augmentative rehabilitation after discharge, in both urban and rural areas. To&#xD;
      address these needs, an online educational and training platform for individuals with LLA&#xD;
      called, Self-Management for Amputee Rehabilitation using Technology (SMART) was designed and&#xD;
      developed. SMART focuses on LLA education, prosthetic limb management, and weekly support of&#xD;
      peers. It is monitored by a trainer through a website. SMART will be evaluated in men and&#xD;
      women with LLA aged 50 years and over, admitted to prosthetic rehabilitation throughout BC&#xD;
      and ON. SMART has the potential to influence a client's post-LLA needs with direct (e.g.,&#xD;
      individual's health) and indirect (e.g., healthcare utilization) benefits. The purpose of&#xD;
      this randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the effect of SMART in community dwelling&#xD;
      older adults with unilateral, above or below, knee amputation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Importance: Amputation is a stressful experience which causes daily fluctuations in&#xD;
      psychological and physical functioning and social interactions. Yearly, more than 7300&#xD;
      patients are admitted to hospitals nationwide for lower limb amputation (LLA), with the&#xD;
      majority (86%) occurring in adults over 50. Consequences of LLA, such as a change in body&#xD;
      image, mobility restrictions, and pain, may lead to depression, social isolation and&#xD;
      decreased quality of life. Clients may lack coping strategies, educational resources, or&#xD;
      access to rehabilitation services, especially for rural living Canadians. Online eHealth&#xD;
      approaches, including the use of tablets, are considered effective approaches for delivering&#xD;
      self-management programs, while addressing logistical barriers. Using a participatory action&#xD;
      research approach, an eHealth platform for individuals with LLA called Self-Management for&#xD;
      Amputee Rehabilitation using Technology (SMART) was co-designed and co-developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' goal is to determine the effect of SMART in community dwelling older&#xD;
      adults (≥50yrs) with unilateral LLA, while documenting implementation factors. the hypothesis&#xD;
      driving this investigation is that older adults with LLA who receive SMART intervention,&#xD;
      compared with paper-based education as a control group, will have greater positive changes in&#xD;
      confidence in their ambulation and walking capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Using a Type 1 Effectiveness-Implementation Hybrid Design randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial (RCT), the 6-week effectiveness of SMART will be assessed on patient-relevant outcomes,&#xD;
      and implementation. A volunteer sample of men and women, aged ≥50 years, with unilateral&#xD;
      transtibial or transfemoral LLA, who started casting of their initial prosthetic limb, with&#xD;
      command of English will be recruited from BC and ON. The sample will be randomly allocated to&#xD;
      the experimental (SMART) (n=41) or control group (n=41), with a ratio of 1:1. Both groups&#xD;
      will receive usual care, provided by their healthcare providers. The experimental group will&#xD;
      receive a SMART enabled tablet for daily use (6 weeks). SMART includes mental and physical&#xD;
      wellness, residual/prosthetic limb managements, use of a prosthesis and weekly peer-support&#xD;
      calls or video call over Zoom, hosted by University of British Columbia, depends on&#xD;
      participant's preference, promoting motivation and establishing goal setting and action&#xD;
      planning. The tablet will also allow asynchronous contact with trainers through a secure&#xD;
      website. The control group will receive a care booklet and weekly contacts. All data&#xD;
      collection will be conducted using Zoom online platform, hosted by University of British&#xD;
      Columbia. Confidence in ambulation will be measured by Ambulatory Self-Confidence&#xD;
      Questionnaire (ASCQ) and Walking capacity will be assessed using the Timed Up and Go test&#xD;
      (TUG)--these measures will be conducted under remote supervision via Zoom. Five elements of&#xD;
      implementation will be assessed including, reach (target population), effectiveness (effects&#xD;
      of SMART), adoption (by setting/staff), implementation (dose delivered and fidelity), and&#xD;
      maintenance of the behavior (in target population and settings). Online one-on-one&#xD;
      semi-structured interviews with 20 participants (SMART group) will be used to assess the&#xD;
      participants' experience. The interviews will be conducted using Zoom video calls. Analyses:&#xD;
      Outcomes will be disaggregated for sex and gender differences. Between- and within- group&#xD;
      differences will be assessed by covariance analysis. Thematic analyses of qualitative data&#xD;
      will explore participants' experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Noah Tregobov's role will be that of the research assistant. Elham Esfandiari will be&#xD;
      coordinating most of the research as a graduate student.&#xD;
&#xD;
      William Miller is the PI and will oversee the overall execution of the project. All other&#xD;
      team members will serve as resources for information, recruitment, research design, etc. but&#xD;
      will not directly interact with participants.&#xD;
