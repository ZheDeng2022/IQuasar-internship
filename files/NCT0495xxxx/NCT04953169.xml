    <textblock>
      Previous research has shown that most parents would allow their child's leftover blood to be&#xD;
      included in a de-identified biorepository using opt-out consent in an outpatient setting. In&#xD;
      a pilot study to evaluate Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) parents' preferences and&#xD;
      comprehension of a written opt-in consent to include their child's sample in a biorepository,&#xD;
      the investigators showed 19% of parents did not agree to participate in the Biobank, more&#xD;
      than the 8.7% reported in other settings. Parent comprehension varied. and the investigators&#xD;
      also noted differential enrollment by sociodemographic factors. Critically ill children and&#xD;
      their parents are vulnerable; seeking consent for non-therapeutic research in critical care&#xD;
      requires special consideration. Therefore, the goal of this study is to evaluate whether the&#xD;
      addition of a stakeholder influenced (parent, clinical research professionals) video aided&#xD;
      consent will improve comprehension and rates of enrollment across diverse groups in this high&#xD;
      intensity setting.&#xD;

      Previous research showed that most parents would allow their child's leftover blood to be&#xD;
      included in a de-identified biorepository using opt-out consent in an outpatient setting.&#xD;
      Critically ill children and their parents are vulnerable; seeking consent for non-therapeutic&#xD;
      research in critical care requires special consideration. In a pilot study to evaluate&#xD;
      Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) parents' preferences and comprehension of a written&#xD;
      opt-in consent to include their child's sample in a biorepository, the investigators showed&#xD;
      19% of parents did not agree to participate in the Biobank, more than the 8.7% reported in&#xD;
      other settings. Parent comprehension varied; in general, parents understood the voluntary&#xD;
      nature of participation but had limited knowledge of the purposes, risks, and benefits of&#xD;
      biorepository research. The investigators showed in an initial single page opt-in consent low&#xD;
      rates of comprehension. The investigators also showed differential enrollment by&#xD;
      socioeconomic status factors. The goal of this study is to evaluate whether the addition of a&#xD;
      stakeholder influenced (parent, clinical research professionals) video aided consent will&#xD;
      improve comprehension and rates of enrollment across diverse groups in a pediatric&#xD;
      biorepository. To achieve this goal, the study will occur in two phases: first, the&#xD;
      investigators will pilot test a survey with up to 20 participants; based on the results of&#xD;
      the pilot the investigators will amend the survey, if and as needed, and then begin a larger&#xD;
      enrollment.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Intervention: Study participants will be randomized to one of two forms of consent for participation in a biorepository as part of another study in the PICU. One version of consent will be the standard consent used in the study for which they are eligible. The second version of consent will present the standard consent + a biobanking video. The primary outcome will be to assess enrollment in the biorepository based upon consent version. Because the participants will be randomly assigned to groups and this may impact their behavior regarding enrollment in the biorepository, it is an interventional design.&#xD;
Secondary outcomes and factors which may correlate with participation will be assessed using qualitative and quantitative measures through an electronic survey. A survey contains questions that will measure knowledge, comprehension, retention, and evaluation of two modes of information delivery, the video + written consent and written information only.</intervention_model_description>
