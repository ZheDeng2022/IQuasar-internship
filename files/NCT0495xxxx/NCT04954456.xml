  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open label, non-randomised, dose-escalation single agent study with&#xD;
      expansion cohorts for dose confirmation/safety and preliminary efficacy of QLS31901 in&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic malignancies&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study Design: This open label, multicenter, first in human study consists of 2 parts. Part 1&#xD;
      is a dose escalation to find the recommended dose for the expansion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 is a dose expansion to confirm the dose of QLS31901 through further evaluation of&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, Pk, preliminary antitumor activity, and functional target engagement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes three periods: Screening( up to 28 days prior to the first dose of study&#xD;
      drug); Treatment(first dose of study drug with treatment cycles of 28 days); and Follow-up (&#xD;
      30days 、60days and 90 days after the last dose) including survival follow-up checks every 3&#xD;
      months up to 12 months after the death of patient or the end of this clinical trial .&#xD;

    <description>Part 1 (Dose escalation): QLS31901will be administered in sequential cohorts each receiving 1 of 6 doses of QLS31901 on day 1 of every 21-day cycle (3 weeks) via IV infusion. Dose escalation will continue until an MTD is reached.&#xD;
Part 2 (Dose Expansion): The PK parameters of QLS31901 will be tested at 2-3 doses determined during the dose-escalation phase in subjects with advanced malignant tumor cohorts.</description>
