      This is a single center, prospective, open label clinical trial with before-after study&#xD;
      design. The study is designed to evaluate the feasibility of hair growth in female and male&#xD;
      pattern hair loss (androgenic alopecia, telogen effluvium, and alopecia areata) using a&#xD;
      fractional non-ablative 1565nm ResurFX module.&#xD;

      This is a single center, prospective, open label clinical trial with before-after study&#xD;
      design. The study is designed to evaluate the feasibility of hair growth in female and male&#xD;
      pattern hair loss (androgenic alopecia, alopecia areata) using a fractional non-ablative&#xD;
      1565nm ResurFX module.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will include up to 13 visits at the clinic: screening; at least 5 and up to 10&#xD;
      treatment (Tx) visits 14+/-3 days apart, and follow up (FU) visits at 1 and 3 months (each&#xD;
      can be +/-7 days out of window) after the last treatment session. See Figure 3: Study Design&#xD;
      for an illustration of the study design, for a summary of the study procedures and Table 1&#xD;
      for the schedule of times and events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will include up to 35 healthy subjects.&#xD;
