    <textblock>
      Magnetic resonance imaging is widely used in the imaging diagnosis of knee joint injury. At&#xD;
      present, there are two kinds of scanning coils used in our country. One is flexible surface&#xD;
      coil, and the patient is 0 ° Scan in the straight position. The other is the special coil for&#xD;
      the knee joint. At this time, because the coil itself is hard material and has a certain&#xD;
      height, the patient is actually in the knee joint micro bending position (about 17 ° 1) Scan.&#xD;
      However, it may not be accurate enough to evaluate ACL injury and patellofemoral instability&#xD;
      with knee scan in extension and micro flexion position.,1、 Previous literatures have shown&#xD;
      that flexion position is superior to extension position in the description and diagnosis of&#xD;
      anterior cruciate ligament injury. The main reasons include: ① in extension position, the&#xD;
      femoral attachment is wider and flat, with the increase of flexion angle, the anterior&#xD;
      cruciate ligament fiber bundle is twisted, and the femoral segment is narrower in sagittal&#xD;
      position, Thus, it can be clearly shown as a cylindrical bundle structure 2; ② The normal ACL&#xD;
      was tensioned in the extension position, so the femoral attachment area was not well&#xD;
      displayed. With the increase of flexion angle, the femoral segment separated from the&#xD;
      intercondylar crest area, and the volume of intercondylar fossa increased; ③ Due to the&#xD;
      influence of partial volume artifacts in the extension position, the normal anterior cruciate&#xD;
      ligament may also show uneven MRI signal, which is similar to injury, resulting in false&#xD;
      positive, while the flexion position can reduce partial volume artifacts. However, there are&#xD;
      few studies on the advantages and disadvantages of flexion and micro flexion scanning in the&#xD;
      description and diagnosis of anterior cruciate ligament injury at home and abroad.,2、 The&#xD;
      medical research of patellofemoral instability found that in the early stage of knee flexion,&#xD;
      the patella of normal people began to move to the medial side of the knee while sliding from&#xD;
      the starting position to the distal side ° The patella moved inward gradually to the maximum,&#xD;
      then turned to the lateral and moved to the knee flexion of 40 ° The patella returned to the&#xD;
      median line 4. The patients with patellofemoral instability were 15 °- forty-five ° The&#xD;
      center of patella moved from the initial position to the lateral position continuously for 5,&#xD;
      so 30 ° The difference between normal people and patients may be more significant.,The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to explore 30 cases ° Application value of flexion position in&#xD;
      diagnosis of anterior cruciate ligament injury and patellofemoral instability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.Image analysis：Comparison of the diagnosis of anterior cruciate ligament injury between&#xD;
      conventional scan position and 30°flexion scan&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1) Two radiologists respectively evaluated the injury of the anterior cruciate ligament.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation criteria for the full length display status are as follows: 3 points: The&#xD;
      anterior cruciate ligament is continuously displayed on multiple levels or the full length is&#xD;
      displayed in one level, without obvious artifacts; 2 points: The full length of the anterior&#xD;
      cruciate ligament cannot be displayed completely but the section can be displayed, there are&#xD;
      artifacts but it does not affect the observation; (1)point: The full length of the anterior&#xD;
      cruciate ligament cannot be identified or artifacts affect the observation. The evaluation&#xD;
      criteria for the display status of the tearing point and stump are as follows: (3) points:&#xD;
      The tear point and stump of the ACL are clearly displayed (2) points: One of the torn points&#xD;
      or stumps of the ACL can be clearly displayed, and the other cannot be clearly displayed (1)&#xD;
      point: The tear point and stump of the ACL cannot be clearly displayed&#xD;
