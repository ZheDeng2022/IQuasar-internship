&#xD;
        2. It was investigate the effect of Lidocaine phonophoresis on headache frequency, PPT,&#xD;

&#xD;
        3. It was investigate the effect of IASTM and Lidocaine phonophoresis on headache&#xD;

      Phonophoresis is the use of therapeutic ultrasound to increase percutaneous drug absorption&#xD;
      Percutaneous administration offers many benefits such as steady plasma levels, lack of&#xD;
      degradation by the gastrointestinal system, and lack of liver effects (first-pass drug&#xD;
      metabolism) on drug molecules. Transdermal drug delivery offers a unique opportunity for&#xD;
      non-invasive and controlled drug delivery, in contrast to needle-based and oral drug&#xD;
      administration. Phonophoresis is a therapeutic method that may be helpful for the treatment&#xD;
      of MTP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are potentially adverse treatment responses to ISTM that may occur. The patient may&#xD;
      experience discomfort during the administration of the treatment, and petechiae (i.e.,&#xD;
      bruising) may become apparent during or after the treatment Although discomfort may be&#xD;
      experienced, patients who have realized a decrease in symptoms have returned repeatedly for&#xD;
      additional ISTM sessions other therapeutic modalities should be administered for pain&#xD;
      management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical and scientiﬁc evidence supports that proper management of patients with headache&#xD;
      should be multimodal including appropriate use of pharmacological and&#xD;
      non-pharmacological.IASTM used to facilitate normal alignment of soft tissue and increase&#xD;
      fibroblast recruitment and regeneration of damaged tissue. Phonophoresis is frequently used&#xD;
      to treat pain associated with muscular disorders, enhancing skin absorption of the topical&#xD;
      medication's molecules. Study report that lidocaine decreases sensory input from&#xD;
      mrofascialTrps and release local Tenderness by lowering the degree of the reflex mechanism&#xD;
      responsible for referred pain.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline and 4 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>assessment via using visual analogue scale (VAS) most commonly consists of a 100mm horizontal line anchored with two opposite labels; patients mark a score on the scale using a vertical line. A VAS is easy to use and therefore applicable to a variety of practice and research settings. (0 means no pain &amp; 10 means highest pain intensity).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessing the change in neck disability</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 4 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>assessment via using Neck disability index: The NDI can be scored as a raw score or doubled and expressed as a percent. Each section is scored on a 0 to 5 rating scale, in which zero means 'No pain' and 5 means 'Worst imaginable pain'. All the points can be summed to a total score. The test can be interpreted as a raw score, with a maximum score of 50, or as a percentage.&#xD;
0 points or 0% means: no activity limitations, 50 points or 100% means complete activity limitation,Mean duration of the test: 3 to 7.8 minutes some benchmarks can be found in literature, Vernon and Moir presented the following interpretation: 0-4points (0-8%) no disability. 5-14points (10-28%) mild disability. 15-24points (30-48%) moderate disability. 25-34points (50-64%) severe disability. 35-50points (70-100%) complete disability.</description>

    <measure>Assessing the change in Pain Pressure Threshold</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 4 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>assessment via using Pressure algometer: Pain Pressure Threshold (PPT) was measured by an algometer using a 1 cm2 disk surface area pressed vertically on MTrP. To provoke pain, pressure was increased with a speed of 1kg/cm2/s-1</description>

    <measure>Assessing the change in frequency of headache</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 4 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Headache frequency assessed after and before 12 sessions. It was defined as the number of headache days per week. The frequency of days with headache in the past weeks was registered by the participant</description>

    <description>A lubricant (Vaseline) will be applied to the skin around the neck area prior to treatment and the M2t blade will be cleaned with an alcohol pad. First, the M2T blade will used to ﬁnd the exact areas of restriction in affected muscles. Then the M2T blade will use at an angle of 45 to apply slow strokes along the muscle. Changes in soft tissue consistency will detected by the clinician through vibrations of the instrument when it slides on areas of irregular fibrosis of the underneath connective tissue. Once an adhesion is discovered, strokes are repeated for 5 min.</description>
