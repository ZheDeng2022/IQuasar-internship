      The study was designed to evaluate the left ventricular longitudinal strain and strain rate&#xD;
      assessed by 2D-STI in patients with coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD) or obstructive&#xD;
      coronary artery disease (CAD) , to investigate the effect of different types of ischemic&#xD;
      heart disease on the LV systolic function, and to explore the value of LS on the diagnosis of&#xD;
      coronary microvascular dysfunction.&#xD;

      A total of 175 patients with chest pain, without wall motion abnormality and without&#xD;
      significant coronary artery stenosis (&lt;50%) assessed by coronary angiography or coronary&#xD;
      computed tomography were enrolled from July 2011 to December 2017. Coronary flow reserve&#xD;
      (CFR) of these patients were detected by transthoracic Doppler echocardiography. The patients&#xD;
      were divided into coronary microvascular dysfunction group ( CFR≤2.5, n=67) and control group&#xD;
      (CFR&gt;2.5, n=108). At the same time, 67 age-matched patients with any major coronary arteries&#xD;
      stenosis≥50% and without wall motion abnormality were involved into the obstructive coronary&#xD;
      artery disease group. Parameters of global longitudinal strain (LS) and strain rate,&#xD;
      subendocardial LS and subepicardial LS were quantified by 2D-STI, the differences of these&#xD;
      parameters among three groups were analyzed，correlation analysis、univariate and multivariate&#xD;
      analysis and receiver operating characteristic curve were used.&#xD;
