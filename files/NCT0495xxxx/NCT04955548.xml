    <textblock>
      66 articular cartilage injury diseases patients were divided into two groups as 1:1. The test&#xD;
      group will be treated with arthroscopic micro-fracture with autologous adipose gel, and the&#xD;
      control group will be treated with arthroscopic micro-fracture. Postoperative MRI evaluation,&#xD;
      Lysholm score, IKDC score, Tegner score, and VAS score will be used as the treatment validity&#xD;
      evaluation index, at the same time testing blood routine, blood biochemistry, urine routine,&#xD;
      CRP, electrocardiogram and other laboratory tests and recording the occurrence of adverse&#xD;
      events.&#xD;

      In this study, 66 patients who were clinically diagnosed as articular cartilage injury&#xD;
      diseases were divided into test group and control group according to the ratio of 1:1. The&#xD;
      test group will be treated with arthroscopic micro-fracture with autologous adipose gel, and&#xD;
      the control group will be treated with arthroscopic micro-fracture. Postoperative MRI&#xD;
      evaluation, Lysholm score, IKDC score, Tegner score, and VAS score will be used as the&#xD;
      treatment validity evaluation index, at the same time testing blood routine, blood&#xD;
      biochemistry, urine routine, CRP, electrocardiogram and other laboratory tests and recording&#xD;
      the occurrence of adverse events.&#xD;
