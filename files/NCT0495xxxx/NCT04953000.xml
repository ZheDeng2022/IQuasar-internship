  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of this study is to learn about changes in the lowest blood levels of Factor&#xD;
      VIII in men and boys when upgraded from standard prophylaxis with Advate to individualized&#xD;
      prophylaxis with Advate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No study medicines will be provided to participants in this study. The study sponsor will not&#xD;
      be involved in how participants are treated but will provide instructions on how the clinics&#xD;
      will record what happens during the study. Participants will need to visit the study doctor 3&#xD;
      times in total during the study. During these visits, study data will be collected by the&#xD;
      study doctor.&#xD;
