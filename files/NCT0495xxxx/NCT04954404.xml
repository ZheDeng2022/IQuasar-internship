    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of transcatheter mitral&#xD;
      valve intervention in Chinese population with mitral valve disease.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, single-arm, single-center clinical evaluation of transcatheter mitral valve&#xD;
      intervention in subjects with mitral valve disease who are treated per standard of care and&#xD;
      who have been determined by the local heart team as appropriate for interventional treatment.&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be treated by transcatheter mitral valve repair or transcatheter&#xD;
      mitral valve replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This single-arm registry will provide valuable new information regarding use of multiple&#xD;
      mitral valve interventional devices and evaluate the safety and effectiveness of&#xD;
      transcatheter mitral valve intervention in Chinese population with mitral valve disease.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with mitral valve disease, as determined by the site from a transthoracic&#xD;
             echocardiogram (TTE), and in the judgment of the investigator intervention is likely&#xD;
             to provide clinical benefit for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject has been informed of the nature of the study, agrees to its provisions and has&#xD;
             provided written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The subject agrees to comply with specified follow-up evaluations and to return to the&#xD;
             investigational site where the procedure was performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients are technical and anatomical eligible for interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. In the judgment of the investigator, subjects are not anatomical eligible for&#xD;
             interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Known hypersensitivity or contraindication to procedural medications which cannot be&#xD;
             adequately managed medically.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Active endocarditis or active rheumatic heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. History of severe bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy or subject will refuse blood&#xD;
             transfusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject has any kind of conditions that might prevent patients benefiting from&#xD;
             therapeutic benefit (i.e., Severe mental illness) or life expectancy is less than one&#xD;
             year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subject has any kind of disorder per investigator's judgement that compromises his/her&#xD;
             ability to give written informed consent and/or to comply with study procedures.&#xD;
