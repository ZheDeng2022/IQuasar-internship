  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe type and extent of psychological distress (adverse&#xD;
      effects) in patients undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer with peritoneal metastases and&#xD;
      after surgery for colorectal cancer with involvement of the urinary bladder.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>

      After being informed about the study all patients giving written informed consent will be&#xD;
      distributed a questionnaire asking questions on depression, anxiety, self-reported cognitive&#xD;
      issues, sleep issues, quality of life and 'fear of cancer recurrence'. All these aspects will&#xD;
      be investigated using validated questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the investigators have the preliminary results (type and extent of psychological&#xD;
      distress developed after CRS+HIPEC or PE) the investigators plan to conduct a workshop. In&#xD;
      this workshop experts in different areas regarding psychological distress, project leaders,&#xD;
      professor from the 'National Center of Late Adverse Effects after Cancer in Pelvic Organs'&#xD;
      (Denmark) and patients will participate. With the input of experts and patients, a treatment&#xD;
      strategy will be developed, and also an assessment will be made concerning which patients are&#xD;
      likely to benefit from treatment by these experts, and which patients could potentially&#xD;
      benefit from counselling by their general practitioner or via self-helping tools at home. The&#xD;
      investigators plan to conduct this workshop autumn 2021 and start counselling spring 2022.&#xD;

        We will prospectively include patients who have undergone surgery at Aarhus University&#xD;
        Hospital, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, and Skåne University Hospital, Malmö.&#xD;
        Inclusion in Denmark will start February 2021 and in Sweden Summer 2021. Inclusion period&#xD;
        is 15 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The HIPEC cohort will be established as a cross-sectional study. For newly operated&#xD;
        patients, inclusion will happen shortly after surgery with prospective questionnaire&#xD;
        follow-ups at 3, 6 and 12 months after inclusion. For patients who have undergone CRS+HIPEC&#xD;
        more than 3 months ago, initial inclusion can take place at 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48 and 60&#xD;
        months after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients in the PE cohort will be included shortly after surgery with follow-up at 3&#xD;
        months, 6 months and 12 months after surgery.&#xD;
