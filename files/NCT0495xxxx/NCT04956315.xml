  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We introduced an automatic knee arthrometer (AKA) and aimed to evaluate the repeatability and&#xD;
      effectiveness thereof in diagnosing ACL rupture compared with the KT-2000.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The AKA was compared to the KT-2000 at 134 N in this study, the anterior displacement and&#xD;
      difference of both knees of every subject were measured. The first protocol was designed to&#xD;
      evaluate examiner effect (level of experience) and contralateral-side effect (left or right&#xD;
      knee) in a single healthy subject, ten times, on ten consecutive days. The second was to&#xD;
      compare the stability in 20 healthy subjects, with a single experienced examiner. Third, we&#xD;
      recruited 200 ACL rupture and 200 healthy subjects as contrast to compare the accuracy of the&#xD;
      devices in diagnosing ACL rupture.&#xD;

    <description>Two examiners performed the test on one healthy subject with both devices for ten consecutive days. We measured the AD of both knees and calculated the ADD of every test. We evaluated the contralateral-side effect by comparing the AD standard deviations of each knee with both devices, and compared the average ADD tested by different examiners with the same device, to estimate examiner effect.</description>
