    <textblock>
      For prognosis evaluation, investigators enroll gastric cancer patients who underwent radical&#xD;
      gastrectomy and collect the laboratory examination and clinicopathological characteristics.&#xD;
      Then independent risk factors for overall survival will be analysed. For predicting efficacy&#xD;
      evaluation, investigators also collect information of patients first diagnosed with&#xD;
      metastases. Diagnostic efficacy is analysed by receiver operator characteristic curve method.&#xD;

      To investigate the novel predictive value of coagulation factors for postoperative outcomes&#xD;
      after radical gastrectomy in patients with gastric cancer, investigators enroll patients with&#xD;
      a pathologically confirmed diagnosis of gastric cancer who underwent radical gastrectomy&#xD;
      between January 2021 and february 2017. Patients follow up data were obtained by regular&#xD;
      follow-up. The most recent preoperative laboratory tests and clinicopathological&#xD;
      characteristics were evaluated. Patients are devided into two groups according to our target&#xD;
      indicator. The 5-year overall survival rate is analysed by Kaplan-Meier method. The&#xD;
      independent risk factors for overall survival are analysed by Cox proportional hazard&#xD;
      regression method. Investigators hypothesized that the target factor is closely related to&#xD;
      disease progression. Whether it can be used as a tumor marker to predict metastasis is to be&#xD;
      studied. Investigators collect laboratory examination including tumor markers of patients&#xD;
      first diagnosed with metastases. Diagnostic efficacy is analysed and compared by receiver&#xD;
      operator characteristic curve method.&#xD;
