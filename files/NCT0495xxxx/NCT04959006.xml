      The aim of this study is to investigate the short term use of olive extract polyphenols on&#xD;
      markers of oxidative stress in response to acute endurance exercise in recreationally active,&#xD;
      healthy volunteers.The study will be conducted under laboratory conditions following a 16 day&#xD;
      supplemental period. Participants will be required to attend the laboratory for a&#xD;
      pre-screening/familiarisation trial followed by assessments PRE (baseline, days 1,2) and POST&#xD;
      intervention (days 18,19). Across the intervention, participants will maintain habitual&#xD;
      dietary intake/ exercise training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally participants will be randomised in a double-blinded manner to either a placebo&#xD;
      or antioxidant-rich supplementation (olive extract water).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesised that the polyphenols (antioxidants) found within olive extract drink will&#xD;
      enhance markers of recovery to an endurance exercise bout compared with the placebo drink.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is current scientific interest in the use of fruit and plant-based polyphenol&#xD;
      supplementation for exercise recovery. Current inference highlights that acute&#xD;
      supplementation (~3d) with &gt;1000mg polyphenols per day may enhance recovery from intensive&#xD;
      exercise, with most focus on pomegranate, cocoa, green tea extracts, Montmorency cherry&#xD;
      concentrate and blackcurrant food products. However, further research is needed to access&#xD;
      impact of natural polyphenols at lower or similar doses for longer time periods (&gt;7d) on&#xD;
      endurance based activities and subsequent recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has also been significant clinical research interest in the properties of waste water&#xD;
      produced when cold pressing olives, which has been shown to contain high concentrations of&#xD;
      natural polyphenols. Fattoria La Vialla is an Italian-based organic farm producing various&#xD;
      products including cold-pressed olive oil. In doing so, they also produce olive extract which&#xD;
      is commercially available as 'Oliphenolia'. Whilst several clinical studies have been&#xD;
      undertaken using this product, to date there have been no studies investigating the&#xD;
      polyphenol potential of olive extract on exercise recovery and subsequent performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As such, this study proposes to investigate the short term use of olive extract polyphenols&#xD;
      on markers of oxidative stress in response to acute endurance exercise in recreationally&#xD;
      active, healthy volunteers. Following a study briefing and provision of written, informed&#xD;
      consent, participants will be required to attend the Human Physiology Laboratory at Anglia&#xD;
      Ruskin University on 5 occasions as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 1 - assessment of metabolic responses to incremental exercise intensity and&#xD;
      individual maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) using a standardised treadmill-based ramp protocol.&#xD;
      Measurement of VO2max will be required for assessment of exercise intensity for sessions 2&#xD;
      and 4 (see below). The treadmill protocol to be used is similar to that previously published,&#xD;
      involving two graded exercise tests (GXT1 and GXT2). Following a 10min resting period and&#xD;
      assessment of baseline measures (e.g. blood pressure, body composition) and a 5min warm up&#xD;
      period, GXT1 will involve participants completing ~6 x 4min stages (3mins running, 1 minute&#xD;
      passive recovery in which capillary blood sampling for glucose/lactate will be carried out).&#xD;
      Starting speeds will be between ~6-10km/h (1 % gradient) with each stage involving speed&#xD;
      increments of 1 km/h. Exercise will continue until blood lactate concentration exceeds 4&#xD;
      mMol/L. Following a 10 min rest, GXT 2 will begin at a speed 2 kmÂ·h-1 below the previous GXT&#xD;
      1 final speed, with gradient increasing by 1 % each min and continuing until volitional&#xD;
      exhaustion. Throughout the test, breath-to-breath analysis (using a Metalyser 3B respiratory&#xD;
      analyser) will be undertaken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 2 - Having overnight fasted, and following resting measures (blood pressure, body&#xD;
      composition via bioelectrical impedance analysis, 3x4ml blood sample), participants will&#xD;
      complete an endurance training session (~75% VO2max for 60mins) on a treadmill. Additional&#xD;
      wholeblood samples (3x4ml) will be collected immediately and 1hr post exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 3 - Participants will return the next morning (overnight fasted) for a resting blood&#xD;
      sample (3x4ml, 24 hours post exercise) and complete the same GXT1 and GXT2 tests carried out&#xD;
      in session 1. This will be used to quantify metabolic and recovery indices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 4 and 5 - following a 16 day nutrition product supplementation period, participants&#xD;
      will return and complete exercise testing as per sessions 2 and 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutritional supplementation - all products will be supplied/certified independently via&#xD;
      Fattoria La Vialla, Italy. Participants will be randomly assigned in a double-blinded manner&#xD;
      to either: i) Experimental condition: 2x25ml olive extract drinks&#xD;
      (https://www.oliphenolia.it/uk/) per day for 16 days, taken one mid-morning, one&#xD;
      mid-afternoon between meals or ii) matched placebo (2x25ml of prune juice water).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples - wholeblood samples will be immediately centrifuged with serum allocated into&#xD;
      separate cryovials for the analysis of: i) the main polyphenol compound- hydroxytyrosol; ii)&#xD;
      a marker of oxidative stress (malondialdehyde, MDA) and iii) key antioxidant enzymes&#xD;
      (catalase, superoxide dismutase) and redox status (reduced glutathione (GSH) to oxidized&#xD;
      glutathione (GSSG) ratio).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the 16 day study period, there will be no dietary restrictions in place (other than&#xD;
      following a low polyphenol diet 24 hours prior to each testing session), however participants&#xD;
      will need to follow the allocated supplementation and maintain their training program (~3-4&#xD;
      run training sessions per week).&#xD;
