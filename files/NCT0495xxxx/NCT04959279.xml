  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct a a pilot trial that tests the acceptability,&#xD;
      fidelity, and feasibility of ED-TREAT.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a pilot RCT that compares ED-TREAT to usual care. The scientific premise&#xD;
      of the proposed project is that an innovative EHR-embedded clinical decision support (CDS)&#xD;
      tool can overcome the challenges to risk assessment and suggest pre-emptive use of behavioral&#xD;
      techniques in the emergency setting. This would help clinicians appropriately invest&#xD;
      resources to improve the quality of care for at-risk patients regardless of ultimate medical&#xD;
      or psychiatric diagnoses and prevent agitation from occurring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot trial will (1) test the integrity of the study protocol in preparation for a&#xD;
      future full-scale RCT, (2) evaluate randomization protocols, (3) estimate rates of&#xD;
      recruitment and retention, (4) assess acceptability and fidelity of the intervention, and (5)&#xD;
      determine if the proposed effect size is reasonable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This registered study is actually the third aim of a larger study where the tool will be&#xD;
      developed and assessed using observational data and input from a steering committee in aims 1&#xD;
      and 2 prior to pilot testing.&#xD;

    <description>Acceptability will be measured using a scale the System Usability Scale. The System Usability Scale is a widely used and effective survey composed of ten statements assessed on a 5-point Likert scale, with inter-item correlations of 0.69-0.75 and a reliability coefficient α of 0.91. The scale provides continuous data from 0-100 with scores &gt;85 as indicative of excellent usability, and will be described using mean and standard deviation. The study will consider ED-TREAT to be acceptable if at least 90% of each clinician group give ratings &gt;85.</description>
