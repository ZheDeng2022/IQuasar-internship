  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vulval cancer, while rare, has increased in incidence by 17% since the 1990s. It is strongly&#xD;
      associated with age, thus this increasing trend is likely to continue with extended life&#xD;
      expectancy. Vulval cancer is highly treatable when detected early. Women with chronic vulval&#xD;
      conditions including lichen sclerosus, lichen planus and vulval intraepithelial neoplasia are&#xD;
      at increased risk of developing vulval cancer. Most patients are in hospital follow-up,&#xD;
      however regular vulval self-examination can pick up lesions earlier. There are no formalised&#xD;
      methods of teaching self-examination and no evidence that it is acceptable to women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to pilot an intervention to promote and support vulval&#xD;
      self-examination for women at increased risk of vulval cancer including those with lichen&#xD;
      sclerosus, lichen planus and vulval intraepithelial neoplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Findings from this feasibility study will inform the design of a randomised trial comparing&#xD;
      the interventions versus control with an embedded cost-effectiveness analysis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vulval cancer is a rare gynaecological cancer, with an increasing incidence rate. IThis trend&#xD;
      is expected to risk in years to come because of an aging populating and the increasing rate&#xD;
      of human-papillomavirus-related vulval squamous cell carcinoma (VSCC) in young women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vulval cancer has a profound effect on the quality of life of women diagnosed with the&#xD;
      disease. It carries both disease-related mortality risk and significant morbidity including&#xD;
      lower limb lymphoedema, sexual dysfunction and groin discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early detection of vulval cancer leads to improved survival and allows for conservative&#xD;
      surgical treatment, lower morbidity and improved cosmesis. It is widely agreed that there is&#xD;
      no role for screening the general population for vulval cancer; there are no systematic&#xD;
      screening programmes nor are there reliable screening methods for identifying malignant&#xD;
      precursors . The identification of vulval premalignant and malignant disease, therefore&#xD;
      relies on the recognition and reporting of vulval symptoms by the patient and the knowledge&#xD;
      and clinical acumen of the health care professional.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is however, a population of women with chronic vulval conditions who are more likely to&#xD;
      develop vulval cancer. Lichen sclerosus (LS), lichen planus (LP) and VIN are recognised&#xD;
      precursors of vulval cancer. Regular follow-up in a specialist vulval clinic allows for&#xD;
      evaluation of symptom control and treatment compliance and identification of early malignant&#xD;
      change; however, regular vulval self-examination may prompt early diagnosis. The interval&#xD;
      between noticing a symptom and seeking help could potentially be reduced by providing clear&#xD;
      information on signs and symptoms of vulval cancer and guidance on monitoring skin-changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary follow-up is not necessary for all women, and women with stable lichen sclerosis&#xD;
      are often managed in primary care. Recent guidance from the British Association of&#xD;
      Dermatology recommends that women with vulval LS who have responded to treatment be&#xD;
      discharged to the care of their general practitioner after a twelve month follow-up period&#xD;
      .However, as a majority of women discharged from UK vulval clinics are not subsequently&#xD;
      followed up in primary care appropriately, it is important that women are able to&#xD;
      self-examine and are confident in recognising and reporting suspicious symptoms. There is,&#xD;
      however, no formalised method of teaching vulval self-examination and many women continue&#xD;
      with secondary care input.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-management focusses on actions that people undertake for themselves to manage their&#xD;
      health and illness. In order to self-manage, self-management support is needed (e.g. actions&#xD;
      by healthcare professionals). Self-management has been shown to be effective in improving&#xD;
      health outcomes such as quality of life. Skin self-examination can reduce mortality in&#xD;
      melanoma. A meta-analysis of 18 trials of skin self-examination concluded that interventions&#xD;
      including personalised phone counselling, whole body photographs and reminders to perform&#xD;
      skin self-examination increased the number of events of patients examining themselves for&#xD;
      skin cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent mixed-method study by the investigators has demonstrated that only 9% of women have&#xD;
      been taught to self-examine, yet up to 86% self-examine regularly. Despite being motivated,&#xD;
      50% reported a lack of confidence in recognition of vulval pathology and a high level of&#xD;
      worry about their vulval condition. Both clinicians and patients agreed that face to face&#xD;
      teaching was the best intervention for teaching vulval self-examination (unpublished).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overarching aim of the intervention is to support vulval self-examination in women at&#xD;
      high risk of developing vulval cancer. The aims, processes and outcomes were agreed at the&#xD;
      focus groups of both women with vulval conditions and clinicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The structured intervention will include face-to-face training on vulval&#xD;
      self-examination(VSE), supplemented with the use of aids including a hand-mirror or a&#xD;
      selfie-stick. Women will be supported with reminders to self-examine, access to a telephone&#xD;
      helpline and a leaflet on self-examination.&#xD;
