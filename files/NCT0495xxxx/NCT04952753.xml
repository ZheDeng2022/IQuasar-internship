  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the preliminary efficacy and safety of NIS793 and&#xD;
      other novel investigational combinations with standard of care (SOC) anti-cancer therapy vs&#xD;
      SOC anti-cancer therapy for the second line treatment of mCRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to explore whether different mechanisms of action may reverse resistance and&#xD;
      improve responsiveness to the currently considered SOC anti-cancer therapy in the second line&#xD;
      metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) setting.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-center, phase II, 2-part platform study with Safety run-in and&#xD;
      Expansion parts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The platform design of this study is adaptive to allow flexibility in the introduction of&#xD;
      additional treatment arms with new investigational drugs in combination with SOC anti-cancer&#xD;
      therapy for the second line treatment of mCRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include a control arm that will enroll participants treated with SOC&#xD;
      anti-cancer therapy (bevacizumab with mFOLFOX6 or FOLFIRI) for the second line treatment of&#xD;
      mCRC. The choice of the chemotherapy medications (mFOLFOX6 or FOLFIRI) will be determined by&#xD;
      the Investigator based on prior exposure to oxaliplatin or irinotecan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each investigational arm will include a combination of an investigation drug and the SOC&#xD;
      anti-cancer therapy. The first investigational arm of the study will explore the combination&#xD;
      of anti-transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) monoclonal antibody, NIS793 with SOC anti-cancer&#xD;
      therapy. Combination of other investigational drugs with SOC anti-cancer therapy may be added&#xD;
      by protocol amendments an additional investigational arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each investigational arm, a Safety run-in part will be conducted before opening the&#xD;
      expansion part to confirm the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for a combination of any&#xD;
      investigational drug with SOC anti-cancer therapy unless the dose has been confirmed&#xD;
      externally to this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The decision to open the Expansion part of the study will be based on dose confirmation of&#xD;
      investigational drug with available safety, relevant PK and other relevant data from Safety&#xD;
      run-in part. Participants in the expansion part will be randomized in 1:1 ratio to the&#xD;
      control arm or investigational arm.&#xD;
