  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label Phase 1, first-in-human (FIH) study of TST005, a bi-specific antibody&#xD;
      consisting of a PD-L1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) and a transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β)&#xD;
      trap in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic cancers&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study has 2 parts. Part A is a dose escalation portion where the patients will be doses&#xD;
      every three weeks following an accelerated 3+3 design. This portion will enroll approximately&#xD;
      25 patients with locally advanced or metastatic cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B is an expansion portion where approximately 30 additional patients will be dosed at&#xD;
      the recommended dose level every 3 weeks. This part will include patients with locally&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic HPV related malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will last approximately 2 years, with assessments including safety labs, ECGs, PKs&#xD;
      and PDs and CT/MRI tumor assessments, based on the Q3W dosing schedule.&#xD;
