    <textblock>
      CT screening of lung cancer offers an opportunity to diagnose early stage lung cancers which&#xD;
      is associated with better prognosis - indeterminate results delay diagnosis whilst interval&#xD;
      imaging is awaited to assess risk of cancer. This study will allow us to examine the&#xD;
      potential of blood-based biomarkers to augment CT screening for lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Blood and sputum samples can be collected in patients attending lung health checks as&#xD;
           part of the Lung Health Check pilot in West London at fixed and mobile scanners and&#xD;
           safely transported for processing and storage in preparation for biomarker development.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The biomarkers will help to identify cohorts of&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. High-risk patients in whom CT surveillance should be conducted more&#xD;
                readily/frequently and diagnostic procedures performed earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Low-risk patients who might need reduced surveillance intensity.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Patients with interstitial lung abnormalities that share similar biomarker&#xD;
                characteristics to patients with clinically significant interstitial lung disease&#xD;

      1. Background 1.1 Lung cancer &amp; CT screening Over 46,000 cases of lung cancer are diagnosed&#xD;
           every year in the UK, making it the 3rd most common cancer type. Lung cancer is the&#xD;
           biggest cause of cancer mortality in the UK and worldwide due to late presentation in&#xD;
           the majority of cases. One year survival for lung cancer ranges from 83% at stage I to&#xD;
           17% in stage IV disease (CRUK data).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Reduced lung cancer mortality (20-26%) can be achieved by Lung Health Checks - which use&#xD;
           'low dose' CT (LDCT) scans of high-risk populations (e.g. heavy smokers), by increasing&#xD;
           the proportion of cases diagnosed at an earlier stage when the treatment options are&#xD;
           better (National Lung Cancer Screening Trial and NELSON studies). A number of pilot&#xD;
           trials within the UK have led to a commitment by NHS England to roll-out a £70m national&#xD;
           pilot. RM Partners commenced recruitment to one of the earlier pilots across two&#xD;
           clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) in West London in 2018, inviting approximately 1000&#xD;
           patients for an LDCT scan at a fixed and mobile scanner (based in a supermarket car&#xD;
           park). This pilot will be extended in 2019-2020 with a further 1000-2000 patients - this&#xD;
           will include both new patients and others who will have a 24 month 'incident scan' to&#xD;
           re-examine for any new cancer after a previously normal baseline scan). This study will&#xD;
           test the uptake and feasibility of biomarker testing and potential scientific&#xD;
           opportunities from specimens received.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2 Current Limitations of Lung Health Checks A) Patient Selection: Two lung cancer risk&#xD;
           calculators, the modified Liverpool Lung Project (LLPv2) and the Prostate, Lung,&#xD;
           Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO) are both multivariate risk&#xD;
           prediction models which have been used to select patients for screening. Both models&#xD;
           have been used to support the identification of high risk individuals during the Lung&#xD;
           Health Check pilot to determine the risk of lung cancer and stratifying for LDCT&#xD;
           screens. Improved patient selection has been identified as a priority to improve the&#xD;
           sensitivity and specificity of lung health checks.&#xD;
&#xD;
           B) Indeterminate Findings: In addition management of indeterminate 'nodules' which can&#xD;
           be either small, possibly early cancers, or benign scarring requires delayed e.g. 3 or&#xD;
           12 month surveillance scans to stratify more invasive procedures such as lung biopsy to&#xD;
           confirm the diagnosis. Blood biomarkers capable of identifying patients at increased&#xD;
           risk of developing or harbouring lung cancer would be valuable adjuncts to protocols for&#xD;
           surveillance and invasive monitoring. Nodules are seen in approximately 10% of scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Existing clinical scores (e.g. Brock score) could be improved upon (see British Thoracic&#xD;
           Society guidelines) and there remains significant clinical uncertainty about best&#xD;
           management in patients with indeterminate nodules.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.3 Circulating and sputum biomarkers in lung cancer early diagnosis Identification of&#xD;
           blood-based biomarkers is an important priority of lung health check research.&#xD;
           Integrating biomarker data along with nodule size and/or volume with other radiological&#xD;
           indices may enable improved risk stratification of surveillance, identifying those at&#xD;
           high risk of lung cancer and requiring more frequent following up, versus those at low&#xD;
           risk and requiring less follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Current technology recognises the potential to detect tumour specific proteins,&#xD;
           metabolites or cell free DNA are examples of biological material in the circulating&#xD;
           blood of patients with lung cancer. Existing approaches under investigation include&#xD;
           genomics, epigenomics, microbiomics, gene methylation and metabolomics. Some groups have&#xD;
           also looked at circulating tumour cells and immune responses to identify patients with&#xD;
           higher risk of cancer. There is also a growing interest in using other bodily fluids,&#xD;
           such as sputum, for this purpose. These have not reached readiness for clinical studies&#xD;
           thus far but in other tumour types, such as in bowel cancer equivalent tests such as the&#xD;
           nationally commissioned stool biomarker ('FIT test) improve diagnostic yield of bowel&#xD;
           cancer screening to stratify resources more cost-effectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Existing approaches in lung cancer screening research suggests that further work will be&#xD;
           needed to identify circulating DNA from the smallest lesions where sensitivity remains&#xD;
           highly variable between studies (10-100%) depending upon the technique selected and the&#xD;
           stage of disease. There is a continued need to explore the role of these approaches in&#xD;
           lung cancer early diagnosis populations, which will likely require a multi-modality&#xD;
           approach of several technologies, for example combining genomics imaging biomarkers with&#xD;
           radiomics. Sputum sensitivity has been shown previously to be in excess of 50% in a&#xD;
           number of settings&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Rationale CT screening of lung cancer offers the opportunity to diagnose early stage&#xD;
           lung cancers which is associated with better prognosis - indeterminate results delay&#xD;
           diagnosis whilst interval imaging is awaited to assess risk of cancer. This study will&#xD;
           allow the investigators to examine the potential of blood-based biomarkers to augment CT&#xD;
           screening for lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Poor patient uptake and logistical issues are perceived to be key challenges to CT screening&#xD;
      that may preclude clinical utility of a blood/sputum biomarker. Assessing whether such&#xD;
      biomarkers can contribute to clinical decision making could then be explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technologies for choosing laboratory biomarkers for risk stratification is evolving rapidly.&#xD;
      Currently there is interest in genomics and circulating tumour cells, but as the potential&#xD;
      for epigenomics, metabolomics, proteomics and exosome analysis evolve, the investigators hope&#xD;
      to have prepared a suitable biobank with which can be used to challenge the latest of these&#xD;
      approaches to the aim of stratification. This may be derived from germline or tumour-based&#xD;
      markers of risk or be derived from the interaction between the tumour cells, host and immune&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Blood and sputum samples can be collected in patients attending lung health checks as&#xD;
           part of the Lung Health Check pilot in West London at fixed and mobile scanners and&#xD;
           safely transported for processing and storage in preparation for biomarker development.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The biomarkers will help to identify cohorts of&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. High-risk patients in whom CT surveillance should be conducted more&#xD;
                readily/frequently and diagnostic procedures performed earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Low-risk patients who might need reduced surveillance intensity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. Methodology This study is designed to collect sputum and blood specimens for laboratory&#xD;
      development of a biomarker that will guide stratification and personalisation of CT screening&#xD;
      study interval. The investigators seek access to basic, link-anonymized clinical and imaging&#xD;
      data which can be integrated with data obtained from the sputum/blood biomarkers - this will&#xD;
      be linked by the study ID number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These data are not expected to influence clinical decision-making. There are no routine&#xD;
      clinical arrangements in place to account for research findings. If a result is identified&#xD;
      for which there is concern, which could be significant for the patient's care, the principle&#xD;
      investigator will seek advice from the patient's clinical team. This is discussed in the&#xD;
      patient information sheet and consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a collaborative research project across RM Partners, Royal Brompton &amp; Harefield&#xD;
      Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Royal Marsden Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, and Imperial&#xD;
      College London.&#xD;
