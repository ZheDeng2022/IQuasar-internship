      1. The subject continues the research of Professor JiaKuo Yu's research group on the&#xD;
           personalized design, processing and manufacturing of personalized total knee replacement&#xD;
           artificial joint prostheses and the verification of animal and human cadavers. It is&#xD;
           planned to carry out the femoral condyle prosthesis of personalized total knee&#xD;
           replacement prosthesis. Clinical trials are carried out on the body, tibial tray&#xD;
           prosthesis and meniscus prosthesis; at the same time, in order to achieve personalized&#xD;
           precision surgery, the clinical trial verification is carried out on the placement of&#xD;
           personalized surgical guides that match the personalized artificial joints.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In the clinical verification study, the research team will summarize the role of&#xD;
           personalized artificial joints for total knee replacement and personalized implant&#xD;
           surgical guides in the precise and minimally invasive treatment of knee joint diseases.&#xD;

      This study aims to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the femoral condyle prosthesis,&#xD;
      tibial tray prosthesis and meniscus prosthesis of the personalized total knee replacement&#xD;
      system; to verify the clinical feasibility and safety of the personalized surgical guide, as&#xD;
      a personalized total knee replacement The clinical application of the prosthesis and its&#xD;
      guide lays the foundation, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1 Evaluate the advantages of personalized total knee replacement surgery in osteotomy&#xD;
      methods, evaluate the impact of anatomical osteotomy methods on intraoperative and&#xD;
      postoperative effects and early and long-term clinical effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 By measuring the amount of osteotomy in personalized total knee replacement surgery,&#xD;
      evaluate the impact of a smaller and reasonable amount of osteotomy on the patient's early&#xD;
      and long-term clinical results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3 Verify the clinical effect of personalized total knee replacement prosthesis, and provide&#xD;
      the basis for its clinical promotion and application.&#xD;
