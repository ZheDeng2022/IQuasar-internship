  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The changes of left ventricular function in patients with sleep apnea were studied by&#xD;
      three-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography to evaluate the changes of left&#xD;
      ventricular function after CPAP treatment&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research purposes: (1) Use 3D speckle tracking echocardiography to measure the diastolic and&#xD;
      systolic strains of the left atrium and left ventricle of OSAS patients, in order to evaluate&#xD;
      the impact and degree of OSA on left ventricular function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (2) By comparing the changes in the three-dimensional ultrasound strain index of the left&#xD;
      ventricle of patients before and after CPAP treatment, and in patients receiving and not&#xD;
      receiving CPAP treatment, to evaluate whether CPAP treatment contributes to the improvement&#xD;
      of cardiac function in patients with OSAS, and to infer the best suitable intervention&#xD;
      population and using time, providing reference basis for clinical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (3) Discovery of serological indicators that predict the severity of the disease and predict&#xD;
      the impairment of heart function Study design: This study is a prospective, observational&#xD;
      controlled study. It is planned to include 30 cases of newly diagnosed OSAS patients in the&#xD;
      Peking University Third Hospital and a control group selected according to age and gender&#xD;
      matching. The three-dimensional strain of the left atrium and left ventricle of the crowd is&#xD;
      measured by the 3D speckle tracking technology, and the serological indicators are detected.&#xD;
      The OSAS group and the control group were followed up during the course of receiving or not&#xD;
      receiving CPAP.&#xD;

        Patients with OSA who underwent sleep monitoring at the Sleep Medicine Center of Peking&#xD;
        University Third Hospital were selected for the study.OSA met the diagnostic criteria of&#xD;
        obstructive sleep apnea in the United States Classification of Sleep Diseases in&#xD;
        2014.Exclusion criteria from this study included previously diagnosed patients with heart&#xD;
        failure,coronary artery disease,valvular disease,cardiomyopathy,arrhythmia,chronic&#xD;
        obstructive/ restrictive pulmonary disease, thyroid dysfunction (including hypothyroidism&#xD;
        or hyperthyroidism), already treated with CPAP, and poor image quality of echocardiography.&#xD;
        Healthy subjects who underwent sleep monitoring to exclude OSA were selected as the control&#xD;
        group during the same period.&#xD;
