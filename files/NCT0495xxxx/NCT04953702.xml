  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective cohort study is designed to investigate possible association(s) between&#xD;
      subchondral insufficiency fractures (SIFKs) of the knee and pre-existing health, lifestyle,&#xD;
      and/or musculoskeletal conditions. In doing so, this research may shed light on the&#xD;
      underlying cause(s) of SIFKs. It is hypothesized that SIFKs of the knee are related to&#xD;
      osteoarthritis, weak bone, and/or metabolic issues, rather than trauma.&#xD;

    <measure>Correlation between subchondral insufficiency fractures (SIFKs) and coexisting conditions</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of patients with subchondral insufficiency fractures and coexisting conditions (overall and per condition) as compared to those without coexisting conditions.&#xD;
Coexisting conditions are identified and defined through metabolic and musculoskeletal-related findings from available lab and radiological results in the patient medical record, such as those related to diabetes, obesity, osteoarthritis and other orthopedic related conditions and metabolic issues.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Correlation between type of treatment for subchondral insufficiency fractures (SIFKs) and treatment outcome (pain level)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The proportions of patients with improvement in pain, worsening of pain, or no change in pain per prescribed treatment.&#xD;
Changes in pain level identified by visual analog scale (VAS) and three-point scale (same/better/worse). The VAS includes subject identification of pain level from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain). Change in pain level identified via VAS in evaluating numerical assessment provided by subjects over course of treatment (increase in rank = worsening; decrease in rank = improving; same rank = same). Change in pain level identified directly using the three point scale (same/better/worse).</description>

    <description>The proportions of patients with improvement in pain, worsening of pain, or no change in pain based on activity level.&#xD;
Changes in pain level identified by visual analog scale (VAS) and three-point scale (same/better/worse). The VAS includes subject identification of pain level from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain). Change in pain level identified via VAS in evaluating numerical assessment provided by subjects over course of treatment (increase in rank = worsening; decrease in rank = improving; same rank = same). Change in pain level identified directly using the three point scale (same/better/worse).&#xD;
Activity level collected via interviews (exercise type/duration/frequency). Activity level categorized into none/mild/moderate/high exertion based on the following criteria:&#xD;
MILD=pool, chair yoga, golf w/ cart&#xD;
MODERATE=land-based exercise/standing/walking/cycling, golf w/out cart&#xD;
HIGH=can't talk while exercising, running/cycling&gt;10miles, jumping, boot camp</description>
