    <textblock>
      A UK multi-centre prospective observational study of clinically possible cases of NOE.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with clinically possible NOE for whom CT imaging is requested will be recruited to&#xD;
      the study by hospital staff at 5-15 UK sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOE remains a relatively uncommon condition with UK - ENT surgeons report seeing between 1&#xD;
      and 10 cases per year. Extrapolating from pilot data, it is anticipated that 820 eligible&#xD;
      patients will be identified in 10 hospital sites over a 12-month recruitment period of which&#xD;
      approximately 90 would be definite cases of NOE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be consented prior to or after CT imaging for a diagnosis of clinically&#xD;
      possible NOE. After providing consent, patients will be asked to complete an EQ-5D-3L&#xD;
      questionnaire. For patients consented remotely, this questionnaire will be completed via an&#xD;
      interview. Local study staff will complete an online case report form hosted on Redcap™ for&#xD;
      each patient including data on demographics, co-morbidities, clinical presentation,&#xD;
      investigations and surgical and antibiotic management. Local study staff will review&#xD;
      patients' hospital notes and contact patients' GPs by telephone 1-year post recruitment to&#xD;
      assess clinical outcomes and mortality rates. Patients will then be contacted 12 months (+/-&#xD;
      1 month) post-recruitment by telephone by local study staff in order to confirm clinical&#xD;
      outcomes (e.g. relapse) and gain information to complete the EQ-5D-3L questionnaire a second&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All CT scans performed at recruitment and any other CT and/or MRI scans performed in the&#xD;
      12-month follow-up period will be de-identified and uploaded by local sites to an online,&#xD;
      web-based secure repository for radiological images. Subspecialised radiologists blinded to&#xD;
      clinical details will assess the images according to pre-agreed, standardised criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selected sites will be asked to freeze any P. aeruginosa isolates routinely collected via ear&#xD;
      swabs as part of clinical care from enrolled participants within 14 days of CT imaging. These&#xD;
      de-identified samples may be sent from sites to undergo genotypic and phenotypic analysis at&#xD;
      the University of Oxford for virulence factors to assess the relationship between these and&#xD;
      disease severity. Of note, no samples beyond those routinely collected as part of the&#xD;
      patients' care will be collected and no patient tissue samples will be stored. These samples&#xD;
      will not contain any biological or genetic material from the patient.&#xD;
