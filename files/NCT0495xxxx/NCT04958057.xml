  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preeclampsia is a disease of pregnancy and first few weeks after birth. It is diagnosed as&#xD;
      new onset of high blood pressure and injury to organs such as kidneys, liver, and brain.&#xD;
      Preeclampsia is growing at a rapid rate - rate that exceeds diabetes and heart disease. Over&#xD;
      half a million lives lost each year to preeclampsia. Women with a history of preeclampsia&#xD;
      have 3-4 times the risk of high blood pressure. They also have double the risk for heart&#xD;
      disease and stroke. Racial and ethnic disparities are present in preeclampsia. Black women&#xD;
      are at higher risk of developing preeclampsia. They are also at much higher risk of dying&#xD;
      from preeclampsia than other women. The reasons behind such disparities are unclear. What may&#xD;
      explain these differences are social determinants of health. The contribution of social&#xD;
      determinants to differences in preeclampsia is well recognized. However, a major gap in&#xD;
      research remains strategies that address these factors. Our study will test a lifestyle&#xD;
      intervention incorporating social risk factors to reduce the risk of preeclampsia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preeclampsia is a significant global health problem affecting over 10 million pregnancies&#xD;
      each year. Preeclampsia disproportionately burdens ethnic minority women, especially African&#xD;
      American women when compared to non-Hispanic white women. Once diagnosed with preeclampsia,&#xD;
      African women are 3 times more likely to die of preeclampsia compared to their white&#xD;
      counterparts. Evidence supports contribution of social risk factors towards racial and ethnic&#xD;
      disparities seen with preeclampsia. However, currently, there are few trials that examine&#xD;
      efficacy of social risks-focused lifestyle interventions on reduction of preeclampsia and its&#xD;
      complications. This proposal is designed to address this crucial gap by testing feasibility&#xD;
      (Aim 1), acceptability (Aim 1) and efficacy (Aim 2) of a social risks-focused lifestyle&#xD;
      intervention to reduce preeclampsia in pregnant inner-city African American women. The&#xD;
      intervention will be delivered via a randomized control trial design (N=100), with 6 monthly&#xD;
      group sessions conducted in the second and third trimesters. The overall hypothesis is that&#xD;
      the intervention will be feasible and acceptable, and that women randomized to the&#xD;
      intervention group will have lower blood pressure and lower rates of preeclampsia compared&#xD;
      with women receiving routine prenatal care.&#xD;
