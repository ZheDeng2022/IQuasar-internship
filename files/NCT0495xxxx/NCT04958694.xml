  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using an adapted stress-reduction intervention called the CEDARS, we will pilot the&#xD;
      intervention in adolescents (N=50) to determine the feasibility and acceptability of CEDARS&#xD;
      implementation and to investigate adolescent stress reduction. As an exploratory aim, we will&#xD;
      explore the influence of the CEDARS on CMH-related behaviors and CMH. We expect that those&#xD;
      adolescents who undergo the intervention will have the greatest improvement in mental health&#xD;
      symptoms than their waitlisted counterparts. Our secondary hypothesis is that those who&#xD;
      report more adversity will also report greater improvement in mental health symptoms than&#xD;
      their peers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This intervention has been adapted based on feedback from previous focus groups with&#xD;
      adolescents, clinical staff, community stakeholders and a CEDARS workgroup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be divided into two groups - 25 in the intervention group and 25 the&#xD;
      waitlisted group. Each group will be divided into smaller cohorts to build rapport and ensure&#xD;
      appropriate attention is given to all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adolescents in the intervention group will participate in 7 weekly, 1-hour sessions. These&#xD;
      sessions will take place over Zoom and be led by a trained facilitator who will teach&#xD;
      adolescents empirically supported strategies for increasing positive affect.The skills are&#xD;
      taught through brief didactic presentations followed by interactive activities and games that&#xD;
      provide opportunities for practice. Participants will complete a baseline and&#xD;
      post-intervention survey to determine the impact of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be three follow-up sessions with participants. The first one will take place 3&#xD;
      months after the program has concluded, the second one at 6 months, and the last one at12&#xD;
      months&#xD;
