  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the anti-tumor activity of FMT administered in combination&#xD;
      with ICI therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) now represent the backbone therapy for patients with&#xD;
      advanced or unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and melanoma. With the use of&#xD;
      anti-PD-1 (Pembrolizumab), overall survival (OS) is now 45% at two years for patients with&#xD;
      metastatic NSCLC with a PD-L1 expression level above 50%. The OS for patients with metastatic&#xD;
      melanoma is now 52% at five years with combination therapy of anti-CLTA-4 (Ipilimumab) and&#xD;
      anti-PD-1 (Nivolumab).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, only a minority of patients obtain durable responses and current biomarkers are&#xD;
      unable to consistently and accurately predict response to ICI. Addressing these unmet needs,&#xD;
      the gut microbiome has emerged as a potential biomarker of response to ICI. Modulating the&#xD;
      gut microbiome to improve response to ICI is an active area of study. One way to modify the&#xD;
      gut microbiome composition is through fecal microbial transplantation (FMT) and pre-clinical&#xD;
      studies showed improved effectiveness of ICI when mice received FMT from lung cancer patients&#xD;
      responding to ICI. Recently, 2 phase I clinical studies published in Science consolidated&#xD;
      these findings, and demonstrated the safety of FMT in patients with melanoma treated with&#xD;
      ICI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Building on phase I studies showing that FMT is safe in patients with cancer receiving ICI,&#xD;
      and compelling data demonstrating the potential of FMT to reverse ICI resistance, there is a&#xD;
      strong rationale to further study the role of FMT in improving ICI efficacy in patients with&#xD;
      melanoma and NSCLC treated with ICI in the first-line setting in a phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our primary objective is to assess the impact of FMT on ICI response and survival. Other&#xD;
      goals of this trial are to study the changes in the patient's gut microbiome composition and&#xD;
      tumor microenvironment contexture following the combination treatment of ICI and FMT.&#xD;
      Efficacy of FMT in terms of response rate and overall survival in patients with metastatic&#xD;
      melanoma and uveal melanoma will be studies as part of an exploratory endpoint.&#xD;

    <description>Objective Response Rate (ORR) as defined by the proportion of patients with NSCLC whose Best Overall Response (BOR) is either a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as assessed by iRECIST, based on RECIST v1.1. BOR is defined as the best response designation over the study as a whole, recorded between the dates of first dose until the last tumor assessment prior to subsequent therapy. CR or PR determinations included in the BOR assessment must be confirmed by a second scan performed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response are first met.</description>

PFS is defined by the proportion of treated subjects remaining progression-free and surviving at 1 year, defined as the time from registration to disease progression or death from any cause. The proportion will be calculated by the Kaplan-Meier estimate, which takes into account censored data.</description>
