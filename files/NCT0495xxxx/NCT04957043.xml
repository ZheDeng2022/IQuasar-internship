      3 d scan sequence can realize continuous thin layer scanning, the thinnest layer thickness of&#xD;
      0.5 mm, to reduce the effects of partial volume effect and improve the spatial resolution&#xD;
      image, the other 3 d sequence can according to need to multiplanar reconstruction based on&#xD;
      the original image, the image of the watch is no longer limited to a fixed plane, and can&#xD;
      avoid repeated scanning, reducing overall inspection time. Initially, 3D MRI uses gradient&#xD;
      echo sequences (3D-GRE). Although the scan time of 3D-GRE is acceptable and has a high&#xD;
      spatial resolution, the contrast between tissues is poor. In recent years, is voxel 3D fast&#xD;
      spin-echo sequence (3D-FSE) has become an alternative 3D scanning sequence. Compared with the&#xD;
      3D-GRE sequence, 3D-FSE has better-intertissued contrast. However, there are still some&#xD;
      problems in the application of 3D sequence in clinical practice. On the one hand, although 3D&#xD;
      sequence reduces the overall scanning time, it increases the single scanning time, so it is&#xD;
      easy to produce motion artifacts. On the other hand, although many studies have demonstrated&#xD;
      the diagnostic efficacy of 3D sequences in the diagnosis of common intraarticular structural&#xD;
      injuries, especially in the diagnosis of knee cartilage injuries, the diagnostic value of 3D&#xD;
      sequences is comparable to that of conventional 2D-FSE sequences, but the evidence on whether&#xD;
      3D sequences can replace 2D sequences is still insufficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, a new fast signal acquisition technology -- Compressed Sensing (Compressed Sensing)&#xD;
      technology has been gradually applied to many kinds of MRI sequences, and its application in&#xD;
      3D sequences can greatly shorten the single scan time. In this study, Modulated Flip Angle&#xD;
      Technique in Refocused Imaging with Extended Echo was applied by United Imaging Co., Ltd.&#xD;
      (Compressed Sensing) Train, 3D-Matrix), which is a fast self-selected echo sequence based on&#xD;
      variable turn Angle technology, and its single scan time can be shortened to 5 minutes. 3 d&#xD;
      sequence to more systematic evaluation on sports injury of knee joint application value, the&#xD;
      investigators will study from within the bony structure of knee joint injury, joint structure&#xD;
      damage and injury of the surrounding support structure aspects to discuss the diagnosis&#xD;
      effect, and with arthroscopy for the gold standard to evaluate the accuracy of the 3 d&#xD;
      structure within the sequence in the diagnosis of knee joint injury.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most important non-invasive examination method for&#xD;
      the diagnosis of knee joint sports injury. 2D-FSE sequence is usually used for axial,&#xD;
      sagittal and coronal scanning in MR examination of the knee joint. The sequence has good&#xD;
      tissue contrast and spatial resolution. However, there are still some problems with 2D-FSE&#xD;
      sequences. For example, the scanning layer thickness is usually up to 3-5mm, and there is a&#xD;
      certain layer spacing, resulting in partial volume effect. In addition, in order to obtain&#xD;
      images with different azimuths, the same sequence needs to be scanned for many times, which&#xD;
      increases the overall inspection time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 d scan sequence can realize continuous thin layer scanning, the most thin layer thickness&#xD;
      of 0.5 mm , so as to reduce the effects of partial volume effect and improve the spatial&#xD;
      resolution image, the other 3 d sequence can be on the basis of the original image according&#xD;
      to need multiplanar reconstruction, make the observation of the image is no longer limited to&#xD;
      the fixed plane, and can avoid repeated scanning, reducing overall inspection time.&#xD;
      Initially, 3D MRI uses gradient echo sequences (3D-GRE). Although the scan time of 3D-GRE is&#xD;
      acceptable and has high spatial resolution, the contrast between tissues is poor. In recent&#xD;
      years, the isosvoxel 3D fast spin echo sequence (3D-FSE) has become an alternative 3D&#xD;
      scanning sequence. Compared with 3D-GRE sequence, 3D-FSE has better intertissue contrast .&#xD;
      However, there are still some problems in the application of 3D sequences in clinical&#xD;
      practice. On the one hand, although 3D sequences reduce the overall scanning time, the single&#xD;
      scanning time increases. At present, the scanning time in most studies is generally 6-10&#xD;
      minutes , so motion artifacts are easily generated. On the other hand, although many studies&#xD;
      have proved the diagnostic efficacy of 3D sequence in the diagnosis of common intraarticular&#xD;
      structural injuries , especially the diagnostic value of 3D sequence in the diagnosis of knee&#xD;
      cartilage injuries is equivalent to that of conventional 2D-FSE sequence, there is&#xD;
      insufficient evidence on whether 3D sequence can replace 2D sequence .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, a new fast signal acquisition technology -- Compressed Sensing (Compressed Sensing)&#xD;
      technology has been gradually applied to a variety of MRI sequences , and its application in&#xD;
      3D sequences can greatly shorten the single scan time. In this study, Modulated Flip Angle&#xD;
      Technique in Refocused Imaging with Extended Echo was applied by United Imaging Co., Ltd.&#xD;
      (Compressed Sensing) Train, 3D-Matrix), which is a fast self-selected echo sequence based on&#xD;
      variable turn Angle technology, and its single scan time can be shortened to 5 minutes. 3 d&#xD;
      sequence in order to more systematic evaluation on sports injury of knee joint application&#xD;
      value, the investigators will study from within the bony structure of knee joint injury,&#xD;
      joint structure damage and injury of the surrounding support structure aspects to discuss the&#xD;
      diagnosis effect, and with arthroscopy for gold standard to evaluate the accuracy of the 3 d&#xD;
      structure within the sequence in the diagnosis of knee joint injury.&#xD;
