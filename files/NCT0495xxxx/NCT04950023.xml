      To study the predictors contribute to the progression of COPD by follow-up of patients with&#xD;
      early COPD and analyze their changes in bioactive molecular, exhaled gas, CT image, lung&#xD;
      function, patient's symptoms and life quality.&#xD;

      A research found that nearly 40% of patients with chronic respiratory symptoms who showed&#xD;
      significant airway inflammation (airway wall thickening and/or lung structure destruction&#xD;
      (emphysema) on chest CT had advanced COPD within 5 years, although their current lung&#xD;
      function failed to meet diagnostic criteria for COPD. Current spirometry-based diagnostic&#xD;
      methods are not the best predictors of COPD progression and death. CT indicated emphysema and&#xD;
      airway inflammation were recognized as better predictors of disease progression and&#xD;
      mortality. Based on a large cohort study, some scholars proposed the concept of &quot;early COPD&quot;,&#xD;
      focusing on people under the age of 50, smoking for more than 10 pack years, having one of&#xD;
      the manifestations of early airflow limitation, abnormal chest CT, and rapid decline of FEV1,&#xD;
      to study the mechanism of disease progression and early intervention methods.[4] In this&#xD;
      study, we enroll participants with early COPD symptoms, to detect the progression of COPD&#xD;
      with 3 years of follow-up. The predictors of disease progression and variants of bioactive&#xD;
      molecular were analyzed, so as to clarify the progressive mechanism of COPD.&#xD;
