    <textblock>
      The 2020 NIMH Strategic Plan for Research calls for investigations targeting neurobiology of&#xD;
      mental illness across the lifespan. Growing evidence suggests that lifespan neurobiology of&#xD;
      schizophrenia (SZ) incorporates two distinct dimensions: aging and disease course. However,&#xD;
      their clinical correlates, associated biomarker trajectories, and implications for treatment&#xD;
      are unknown. This study will investigate differential aspects of SZ neurobiology captured by&#xD;
      aging and disease course, in order to develop specific biomarkers which may offer actionable&#xD;
      targets for SZ stage-dependent intervention. The study is predicated on a novel mechanistic&#xD;
      Model of SZ Trajectories across the Adult Lifespan, positing distinct biological fingerprints&#xD;
      within the anterior limbic system for aging and disease course in SZ: (1) alterations in the&#xD;
      circuit's function and structure that occur earlier in the lifespan and are larger in&#xD;
      magnitude than the alterations expected with normal aging (accelerated aging dimension); and&#xD;
      (2) regionally-specific anterior limbic &quot;hyperactivity&quot; in early SZ, with a subsequent&#xD;
      transformation into &quot;hypoactivity&quot; in advanced SZ (disease course dimension). In a sample of&#xD;
      SZ and matched healthy controls (n=168, 84/group) aged 18-75 years the investigators will&#xD;
      ascertain a broad panel of biomarkers [via multimodal brain imaging: optimized 1H-MRS,&#xD;
      high-resolution task-based fMRI, perfusion (Vascular Space Occupancy) and structural MRI],&#xD;
      along with comprehensive cognitive and clinical assessments. All measures will be acquired at&#xD;
      baseline and repeated at 2-year longitudinal follow-up. Using cutting-edge computational&#xD;
      approaches, the study will examine (i) effects of aging and SZ course on anterior limbic&#xD;
      system biomarkers; (ii) lifespan trajectories for different biomarkers; (iii) patterns of&#xD;
      limbic system biomarkers in age- and SZ course-based subgroups (e.g., Younger vs. Older,&#xD;
      Early-Course vs. Advanced SZ), as well as in data-driven subgroups (e.g., those with vs.&#xD;
      without accelerated aging profiles); and (iv) associations between biomarkers and cognitive&#xD;
      and clinical outcomes. This research will advance the field by providing novel biomarkers&#xD;
      that capture unique neurobiological contributions of aging and disease course in SZ, and will&#xD;
      motivate future studies on SZ mechanisms across the lifespan and development of precision&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;

      Specific Aims: In order to investigate aging and disease course dimensions in SZ, the study&#xD;
      will ascertain a broad panel of biomarkers using multimodal brain imaging, along with&#xD;
      comprehensive cognitive and clinical measures, which will allow integration of in vivo&#xD;
      molecular; circuit structure and function; and clinical levels of system pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. In vivo Molecular Biomarkers. Examine age- and disease course-dependent effects on&#xD;
      excitatory and inhibitory 1H-MRS-based biomarkers in the anterior limbic system in SZ. SZ and&#xD;
      CON (n=84/group) will undergo novel triple-refocusing 1H-MRS with Glutamate (Glu), GABA and&#xD;
      broader metabolite measures from bilateral Hipp and mPFC. Hypothesis 1.1: SZ will show&#xD;
      declines in Hipp-mPFC Glu and GABA along the lifespan, with significantly earlier and larger&#xD;
      reductions than those observed in CON. Hypothesis 1.2: SZ will show distinct Hipp-mPFC Glu&#xD;
      and GABA markers along the disease course, with significantly elevated or equivalent Glu, and&#xD;
      reduced GABA levels, in early SZ, and reduced Glu and GABA in advanced SZ, compared to CON.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Functional Circuit Biomarkers. Examine age- and disease course-dependent effects on&#xD;
      intrinsic and task-based activation biomarkers in the anterior limbic circuit in SZ, using&#xD;
      high resolution perfusion [Vascular Space Occupancy] and functional MRI with an episodic&#xD;
      memory [Pattern Separation] task, respectively. Hypothesis 2.1: SZ will show declines in&#xD;
      Hipp-mPFC intrinsic and task-based activity along the lifespan, with significantly earlier&#xD;
      and larger reductions than those in CON. Hypothesis 2.2: SZ will show distinct Hipp-mPFC&#xD;
      intrinsic and task-dependent activity signatures across the disease course, with&#xD;
      significantly elevated or equivalent regional activation in early SZ, and reduced activation&#xD;
      in advanced SZ, compared to CON.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. Structural Circuit Biomarkers. Examine age- and disease course-dependent effects on&#xD;
      structural biomarkers in the anterior limbic system in SZ, using high resolution structural&#xD;
      MRI. Hypothesis 3.1: SZ will show declines in cortical thickness and volume in Hipp, mPFC and&#xD;
      broader fronto-temporal regions across the lifespan, with significantly earlier and larger&#xD;
      reductions than those in CON. Hypothesis 3.2: SZ will show distinct fronto-temporal&#xD;
      alterations along the disease course, with modestly reduced cortical thickness and volume&#xD;
      measures in early SZ and larger reductions in advanced SZ, compared to CON.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators also predict that molecular, functional, and structural alterations in the&#xD;
      anterior limbic system will be associated with impaired episodic memory and broader cognitive&#xD;
      dysfunction in SZ, with declining cognition along both the lifespan and SZ course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will advance the field by providing novel biomarkers that capture unique&#xD;
      neurobiological contributions of aging and disease course in SZ, and will motivate future&#xD;
      studies on SZ mechanisms across the lifespan, and the development of relevant precision&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;

    <description>SZ and CON will undergo high-resolution brain fMRI with associational memory (Pattern Separation) task at baseline and 2-year longitudinal follow-up. Hypothesis 2.1: SZ will show declines in regional activation (BOLD signal) with Lure&gt;Repetition contrast along the lifespan, with significantly earlier and larger reductions than those in CON. Hypothesis 2.2: Within the disease course dimension, early SZ will show increased activation with a loss of activation modulation (e.g., increased BOLD signal with both Lures and Repetitions), with a subsequent decline in activation in mid-course and advanced SZ, compared to CON. We predict that these activation effects will be preset in the Hipp DG/CA3 and in a broader circuit supporting pattern separation operations (i.e., mPFC, parahippocampal, retrosplenial cortex).</description>
