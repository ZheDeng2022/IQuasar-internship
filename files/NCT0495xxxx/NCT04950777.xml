  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research will be the first study to investigate the feasibility of incorporating&#xD;
      physical literacy screening into primary care clinical settings, while determining the&#xD;
      efficacy of integration on physical literacy. To investigate aim 1, feasibility, the research&#xD;
      team will provide all children ages 6-11 presenting for well-child care by the participating&#xD;
      pediatricians with physical literacy screening (PAVSPED) at point of entry for care. The&#xD;
      child will complete the 5 yes/no screen and answers will be provided to the pediatrician for&#xD;
      acknowledgement. To investigate aim 2, efficacy, participants will be randomized into a&#xD;
      control group (standard of care) or an intervention group (patient education). The&#xD;
      intervention group will receive the patient education document with their questionnaire,&#xD;
      randomization will occur by the study team prior to subject visits. The patient education&#xD;
      will be designed to address and investigate the four domains of physical literacy including,&#xD;
      knowledge and understanding, motivation and confidence, daily behavior, and physical&#xD;
      competence, (i.e., referral based training/PT (passive), self-motivated/directed exercise&#xD;
      choice (speaks to child ownership/motivation), simple play outside 60 minutes/day (middle)).&#xD;
      All participants will receive a 6-month follow-up email with the same 6 questions to assess&#xD;
      if responses changed between the two groups.&#xD;
