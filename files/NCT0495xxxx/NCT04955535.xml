  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study retrospectively analyzed the history of present illness of PVNS patients in our&#xD;
      hospital. The enrolled patients were followed up by telephone to follow up their&#xD;
      postoperative recovery and living conditions. Take the patient's pathological specimens for&#xD;
      immunohistochemical testing, evaluate the relationship between the expression of different&#xD;
      molecular targets, clinical manifestations and patient prognosis, and explore new molecular&#xD;
      targets related to disease diagnosis and treatment.&#xD;

      This study retrospectively analyzed the symptoms, time of onset, injury history, laboratory&#xD;
      examinations, imaging examinations, and intraoperative conditions of PVNS patients in our&#xD;
      hospital. The enrolled patients were followed up by telephone to follow up their&#xD;
      postoperative recovery and living conditions (VAS score, SF-36 score). Take the patient's&#xD;
      pathological specimens for immunohistochemical testing, evaluate the relationship between the&#xD;
      expression of different molecular targets, clinical manifestations and patient prognosis, and&#xD;
      explore new molecular targets related to disease diagnosis and treatment.&#xD;
