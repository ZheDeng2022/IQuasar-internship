  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) results from the metastasis of a primary cancer of the&#xD;
      peritoneum (e.g., appendiceal, ovarian, uterine, colorectal, and gastric cancers) that then&#xD;
      disseminates throughout the abdominal cavity. Historically progression to PC was considered&#xD;
      terminal and resulted in survival times on the scale of a few months with palliative care&#xD;
      being the best option for patients. More recently, cytoreductive surgery (CS) has emerged as&#xD;
      a means to prolong and improve patient lives with a median increase in survival of up to ~5&#xD;
      years. It has been reported that for every 10% increase in cytoreduction there is a 5.5%&#xD;
      increase in median survival time. In addition to surgical tumor debulking within the&#xD;
      peritoneal space, it has also been shown that coupling surgical intervention with&#xD;
      hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) can have an even greater impact on patient&#xD;
      outcomes. Pegsitacianine, a micellar fluorescence agent, exploits the ubiquitous pH&#xD;
      differences observed between cancerous and normal tissues. This in turn, provides a highly&#xD;
      sensitive and specific fluorescence response after localizing within the tumor&#xD;
      microenvironment, thus allowing the detection of primary tumors, their margins, metastatic&#xD;
      disease, and tumor-containing lymph nodes.&#xD;
