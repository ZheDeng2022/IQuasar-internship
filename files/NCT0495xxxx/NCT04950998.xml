  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop and test a physical activity-tracking smartphone app&#xD;
      designed to facilitate physical activity in older adults with mild cognitive impairments or&#xD;
      mild dementia. The app targets provides tips, messages, and strategies to overcome common&#xD;
      barriers older adults face to being physically active. Participants will include older adults&#xD;
      with memory or thinking problems or those diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment or mild&#xD;
      forms of dementia who are smartphone users age 65 years or older and who are not meeting&#xD;
      nationally recommended levels of physical activity. In the clinical trial phase of this&#xD;
      study, 15 participant-study partner dyads will be oriented to the app and use it for a&#xD;
      two-month period. Dyads will keep a diary to document their experiences and participants'&#xD;
      activity patterns will also be tracked at the beginning and end of the study. After the&#xD;
      two-month app trial is complete, dyads will return for a follow-up interview to discuss their&#xD;
      experiences and provide suggestions for app improvements. Findings from this stage of the&#xD;
      overall study will be combined with previous study phases to derive specifications for an&#xD;
      optimized app for older people with mild cognitive impairments or mild dementia.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in objective physical activity, as measured using ActivPAL</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Objective physical activity will be measured in real time using the ActivPAL thigh-worn accelerometer. The device generates totals for the time spent lying, sitting, standing, and stepping, every second of the day. Total activity counts per minute (higher activity counts = more activity) and number of steps taken will be derived from data. Types of activity (e.g., sitting versus standing) are determined through ActivPAL's proprietary algorithms.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in objective sedentary activity, as measured using ActivPAL</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Objective sedentary activity will be measured in real time using the ActivPAL thigh-worn accelerometer. The device generates totals for the time spent lying, sitting, standing, and stepping, every second of the day. Time spent in sedentary activities will be derived using ActivPAL's proprietary algorithms that distinguish between types of activities (e.g., sitting versus standing) .</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>App usability measured using the User Version of the Mobile Application Rating Scale (uMARS)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The uMARS is a self-report measure to assess end users' perceptions of the quality of an mobile health tool.&#xD;
Includes an overall app quality score and four subscales: engagement, functionality, aesthetics, and information quality. The higher the scores in the subsections and overall score the higher the perceived quality related to that domain or the overall app.&#xD;
Overall score and subscale scores are calculated as a mean of 5-point Likert-scale ratings for the items within that section. Range 1 &quot;inadequate&quot; to 5 &quot;excellent.&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>User experience, as measured through interview and diary</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be queried about their experience with the app during an interview. A study-specific semi-structured interview guide will be used to guide discussions about topics such as potential efficacy to impact physical activity and suggestions for enhancements. Additionally, participants will keep a narrative journal during the 2-month period to document any notable experiences over the trial period.</description>

    <description>In this single-arm trial, participants will use a physical activity smartphone app for a two-month period. The app includes motivational messages, tips to increase the intensity level of everyday activities, and strategies to reduce sedentary behaviors. Users can also track their physical activity levels and sedentary activity.</description>
