      This is a Phase II, prospective, placebo-controlled, double-blinded (investigator/site staff&#xD;
      and participants), multi-center study; the Sponsor will be blinded until the interim&#xD;
      analysis. Participants aged ≥ 12 to &lt; 18 years will be enrolled. All eligible participants&#xD;
      will be randomized to receive either MVC-COV1901 or placebo in a 6:1 ratio.&#xD;
