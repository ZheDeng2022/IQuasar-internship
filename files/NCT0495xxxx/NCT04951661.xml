  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At the Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) Pain Management Center (PMC), knee OA is one of the&#xD;
      most common conditions causing older adults to experience chronic pain. At this site, the&#xD;
      core treatments of education, physical activity, and weight management are addressed, and&#xD;
      then both pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatment options are available for patients&#xD;
      living with chronic pain. Pharmacological treatments, such as topical and oral nonsteroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen, steroidal and non-steroidal injections, and&#xD;
      prescription medications are currently the most commonly used treatments for chronic pain,&#xD;
      but are also associated with limited benefits and dangerous side effects, such as addiction.&#xD;
      Clients can also opt for nonpharmacological pain treatments at the PMC, such as acupuncture,&#xD;
      reiki, physical therapy, and yoga, which are currently being researched at the clinic as&#xD;
      well. The critical gap addressed with this pilot study is the need for additional safe and&#xD;
      feasible treatment options for the growing population of older adults with chronic knee OA,&#xD;
      as there is limited existing research on the effects of nonpharmacological treatments on this&#xD;
      population. While past studies at the PMC have looked at the physiological mechanisms&#xD;
      involved with chronic knee OA and the older adult population, the site has had limited&#xD;
      funding to research nonpharmacological treatments such as virtual reality. In fact, there is&#xD;
      limited evidence in the literature on the effects of virtual reality in reducing pain&#xD;
      specifically for the older adult population.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Virtual reality has been shown to be feasible for a variety of populations, including young&#xD;
      people with autism experiencing specific phobia, pediatric burn patients, and young adults.&#xD;
      However, there is limited evidence on the feasibility of VR for treating pain for the older&#xD;
      adult population. Preliminary studies demonstrate the feasibility and safe qualities of&#xD;
      immersive VR as a treatment tool for older adults with cognitive and physical impairments.&#xD;
      One study demonstrated that older adults reported no negative side effects and 76% of the&#xD;
      group wanted to try VR again. Furthermore, preliminary evidence on the feasibility of use in&#xD;
      the clinic in terms of the construct of time was demonstrated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another study found that young adults and older adults who engaged in an immersive spatial&#xD;
      navigation VR environment reported similar experiences, demonstrating that older adults&#xD;
      experienced acceptable adverse effects and reported enjoyment through the VR immersion.&#xD;
      Further recent studies provide evidence on the attitudes and treatment acceptability of older&#xD;
      adults with chronic musculoskeletal pain towards VR as a distraction therapy for chronic pain&#xD;
      exacerbations. These researchers discovered that 73.4% of the participants found VR to be an&#xD;
      acceptable way to manage pain, and 73.3% reported they would be willing to use it for their&#xD;
      pain. Only 26% of the participants experienced side effects such as general discomfort or&#xD;
      eyestrain. Additionally, the qualitative data in this study suggests greater ease of use with&#xD;
      sufficient practice and a preference towards relaxation, meditation, or biofeedback&#xD;
      simulations with realistic images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty percent of older adults in the United States report experiencing chronic pain, with&#xD;
      41% of this subset of the population experiencing chronic joint pain. Knee osteoarthritis&#xD;
      (OA) affects 37% of individuals aged 60 years or older who participated in the National&#xD;
      Health and Nutrition Examination. This condition typically involves pain, stiffness, reduced&#xD;
      joint motion and muscle weakness, and chronic pain that can have profound effects on physical&#xD;
      function, psychological parameters, and overall quality of life. In knee OA, cartilage in the&#xD;
      knee is lost and there is failed repair of joint damage, as OA is a disease of the whole&#xD;
      joint. There is also often a discrepancy between severity of symptoms and severity of knee&#xD;
      OA, which may relate to pain sensitization, adaptation to chronic pain, or reduction in&#xD;
      activity to avoid pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Virtual Reality (VR) people experience a three-dimensional, computer-generated environment&#xD;
      via a computer headset. There are several mechanisms through which VR has been shown to&#xD;
      effectively reduce pain. For one, gate theory of attention proposes that VR reduces&#xD;
      perception of pain by absorbing and diverting attention away from pain. Dr. Brennan Spiegel,&#xD;
      director of Cedars-Sinai Health Services Research, reports that VR's ability to distract the&#xD;
      brain allows the brain to relax. He states that this modality &quot;triggers signals that release&#xD;
      natural pain-killing opioids from the spinal cord, essentially closing the gate, blocking the&#xD;
      pain&quot;. Therefore, VR distraction may be a useful tool for clinicians who work with clients&#xD;
      experiencing a variety of pain-related conditions, such as chronic knee osteoarthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study will build off of these preliminary studies by working from the basis that&#xD;
      older adults generally enjoy their immersive VR experience and including some of the relevant&#xD;
      key requirements for immersive environments such as individual briefing and user-friendly&#xD;
      handling. There are still many questions that need to be answered about the feasibility of VR&#xD;
      as a clinical tool and its effectiveness in decreasing chronic pain, specifically for older&#xD;
      adults. Therefore, this pilot study will look more into these topic areas through a subset of&#xD;
      the population of older adults with chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there has been very little research that has examined the effect of VR on chronic&#xD;
      pain, particularly for the older adult population. Knowledge on the effectiveness of VR for&#xD;
      chronic pain for older adults is necessary to determine best methods to feasibly integrate VR&#xD;
      into clinical practice.&#xD;
