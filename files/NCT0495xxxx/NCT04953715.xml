  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to study immunosuppression drugs, certain foods, and how they&#xD;
      can change the microbiome (the natural microorganisms inside the body) of the individual&#xD;
      taking the immunosuppressive medications. We want to study how the microbiome affects how&#xD;
      your body process the transplant medication.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Immunosuppression drugs, like antibiotics and certain foods, can change the microbiome (the&#xD;
      natural micro-organisms inside the body) of the individual taking the drug. We want to study&#xD;
      what impact these changes to the microbiome have on the individual. We are specifically&#xD;
      interested in how these changes to the microbiome may change the metabolism (breakdown) and&#xD;
      action of medications. We already know that individual genetics impact the metabolism,&#xD;
      absorption, and toxicities of some medications. We suspect the microbiome will have similar&#xD;
      impacts on medications.With a better understanding of how individual microbiome impacts&#xD;
      immunosuppressant medications used to help transplant recipients from rejecting their new&#xD;
      organs, we can more accurately prescribe and dose these medications to better treat and care&#xD;
      for our transplant patients and their organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect that you will be in this research study for up to 12 years. There will be periods&#xD;
      of time that require your active participation (visits) and periods of time that will be more&#xD;
      passive participation (allowing our study staff to follow-up your medical records for&#xD;
      outcomes).&#xD;
