      Acute chest syndrome is a severe respiratory complication of sickle cell disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard prevention of this dangerous complication is spirometry in wich patient is&#xD;
      required to take deep breaths trough a little device several times a day. This treatment is&#xD;
      compromised when pain in important or when the patient is asleep and cannot participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesised that non invasive ventilation in wich patient have no effort&#xD;
      to take might be a better prevention than spirometry and may improve pain and quality of&#xD;
      sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children with vaso-occlusive crisis necessitating morphinic treatment will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned with either spirometry or ventilation and the investigators will monitor for&#xD;
      occurrence of acute chest syndrome, pain and quality of sleep.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute chest syndrome is a severe complication of sickle cell disease. Several factors can&#xD;
      contribute to this complication including infections, vaso-occlusive crisis, important pain&#xD;
      that may give shortness of breath and morphinic treatments as they may cause hypoventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard prevention of this dangerous complication is incentive spirometry in wich&#xD;
      patient is required to take deep breaths trough a little device several times a day. This&#xD;
      treatment is compromised when pain in important or when the patient is asleep and cannot&#xD;
      participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients who have had surgery who have also pain and morphinic treatments, non invasive&#xD;
      ventilation have proven a good option for preventing pulmonary complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides, our experience in non invasive ventilation for treatment of acute chest syndrome&#xD;
      show a good tolerance and efficiency. It also seems to help with pain management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesised that non invasive ventilation in wich patient have no effort&#xD;
      to take might be a better prevention than incentive spirometry and may improve pain and&#xD;
      quality of sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After informed consent, patients aged from 6 to 20 years old with SS or S-Beta sickle cell&#xD;
      disease with vaso-occlusive crisis necessitating morphinic treatment hospitalised in&#xD;
      intensive care unit in Necker Hospital for Sick Children (Paris) will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      with either spirometry or ventilation. It is a monocentric study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with acute chest syndrome, oxygen needs, pneumonia or other condition requiring&#xD;
      ventilation at presentation will not be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spirometry will be realised through volumetric devices, every two hours during the day with&#xD;
      10 maximum inspirations and at night if the patient is awake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non invasive ventilation will be applied through a nasal mask with VS III machines from&#xD;
      Resmed®, at least one hour every four hour but may be maintained more if the patient chooses&#xD;
      to or is asleep with the machine on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will monitor for occurrence of acute chest syndrome, pain, morphinic&#xD;
      requirements, length of hospital stay, comfort, quality of sleep The treatment will be&#xD;
      continued until morphinic treatment is stopped. The investigators intend to include 60&#xD;
      patients in each arm to show a difference of 25% in the occurrence of acute chest syndrome&#xD;
      (primary judgement criteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute chest syndrome will be defined according to the criteria used by Vichinsky (Vichinsky,&#xD;
      E. P. et al. Acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease: clinical presentation and course.&#xD;
      Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease. Blood 89, 1787-1792 (1997) The investigators will&#xD;
      aslo compare morphinic requirements, length of hospital stay and quality of sleep as&#xD;
      secondary judgment criteria.&#xD;
