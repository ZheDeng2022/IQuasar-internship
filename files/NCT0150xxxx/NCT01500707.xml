          -  Diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) characterized by at least two of the&#xD;
             following: resting tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity (must have either resting tremor or&#xD;
             bradykinesia); participants must have either moderate severity PD or moderate to&#xD;
             severe PD with motor fluctuations&#xD;

             &quot;off&quot; state at Screening; for participants with moderate to severe PD with motor&#xD;
             fluctuations, Hoehn and Yahr stage must be ≥2 and ≤4 in the &quot;on&quot; state at Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  On stable anti-parkinson treatment regimen that includes L-DOPA/carbidopa for at least&#xD;
             3 weeks prior to screening and clinically stable at the time of randomization&#xD;
             (predose), and first morning dose of L-DOPA must be 100 mg or greater&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  L-DOPA therapy for ≥ 6 months prior to screening&#xD;
