      This study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the effect of an&#xD;
      internet-based, guided self-help treatment of reoccurring and distressing nightmares. Imagery&#xD;
      Rehearsal Therapy (IRT) will be compared to an active control treatment (CONT) and a&#xD;
      recording-only group (REG). It is hypothesized that both active treatments will be superior&#xD;
      to REG, and that IRT will be superior to CONT.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nightmares are distressing or frightening dreams, affecting 2.4 to 5% of the population.&#xD;
      Suffering consists of disturbed sleep, fear and distress during night and/or day, expectancy&#xD;
      anxiety and impaired functioning during the day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various forms of Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) has been previously shown to be effective&#xD;
      against nightmares and among them Imagery Rehearsal Therapy (IRT) has been the most&#xD;
      promising. IRT consists of approaching the unpleasant dreams and to imagine a positive ending&#xD;
      to them. So far IRT has been compared to untreated controls or treatments that have included&#xD;
      methods to some extent similar to those in IRT, and it is therefore difficult to determine&#xD;
      the specific effect of IRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since access to CBT therapists is low, different types of self-help treatments for nightmares&#xD;
      have been tested, but often these therapies have been provided without the assistance of a&#xD;
      therapist, a procedure known to usually lower the effect of self-help treatments. So far, no&#xD;
      nightmare treatment has been conducted over the Internet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IRT will in this study be given as Internet CBT (ICBT) and will be compared to an active and&#xD;
      credible control treatment (CONT) consisting of relaxation and exercise to focus on positive&#xD;
      images or dreams, but without approaching or reinterpreting the nightmares. Relaxation&#xD;
      Training has previously shown preliminary positive effects on nightmares. Both active&#xD;
      treatments will be compared to a waiting list which only records how they manage their&#xD;
      nightmares (REG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of this study is to examine whether the positive effects of IRT that has&#xD;
      been seen in previous studies persists even when IRT is compared with a credible, active&#xD;
      control treatment that does not contain the presumed active parts of the IRT. In addition, an&#xD;
      untreated control group is used to ensure that the effects are not only due to spontaneous&#xD;
      improvement. The control group will afterwards be treated with IRT without therapist support,&#xD;
      in order to make a preliminary evaluation of the importance of therapist support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some researchers argue that nightmares are not to be seen only as something that is often&#xD;
      caused or is a side effect of other conditions, but as a separate problem that should receive&#xD;
      special treatment. Our study will help to determine whether it is possible to treat&#xD;
      nightmares also in people with other problems such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).&#xD;
