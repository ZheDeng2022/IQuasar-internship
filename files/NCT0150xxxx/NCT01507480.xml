  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antiangiogenic drugs, such as bevacizumab, are a new treatment strategy in Hereditary&#xD;
      Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT). Its systemic administration in patients with HHT improves&#xD;
      liver damage-related symptoms and epistaxis (cases reported and on-going&#xD;
      study-ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier #NCT00843440-). To limit the systemic adverse effects of&#xD;
      bevacizumab and to ease administration, a local administration seems suitable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A clinical case recently showed the benefits of bevacizumab nasal spray in these patients.&#xD;
      Its results were confirmed in a characterization study on bevacizumab transport through&#xD;
      porcine nasal mucosa (in press).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It seems necessary to assess the tolerance and efficacy of bevacizumab nasal spray in humans&#xD;
      for the treatment of epistaxis in HHT with a prospective phase 1 study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the tolerance of increasing doses of&#xD;
      bevacizumab administered as a nasal spray in patients with HHT-related epistaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This phase-1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, monocentric study is to be&#xD;
      carried out sequentially (dose escalation) on 5 groups of 8 patients. Each group is made up&#xD;
      of 6 verum and 2 placebos.&#xD;
