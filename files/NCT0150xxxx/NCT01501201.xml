      The objectives are to compare the results of the Gastric By-Pass (GBP) to that of optimized&#xD;
      medical therapy in patients with obesity and poorly controlled type 2 diabetes in terms of&#xD;
      mortality, weight loss, glycemic control, quality of life, cost, cost-effectiveness and cost&#xD;
      utility of these two strategies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Optimizing the management of type 2 diabetes (T2D) will remain a major public health concern&#xD;
      for decades to come. T2DM has already affected 4% of the French population and generates each&#xD;
      year over 12 billion euros of expenditure. By combining therapies, oral and/or injectable&#xD;
      (insulin or analogues of GLP-1), the current management of T2DM provides two thirds of&#xD;
      patients with a satisfactory metabolic control (HbA1c &lt; 7%) and reduced incidence of&#xD;
      cardiovascular complications. Its effect on mortality, however, remains more limited,&#xD;
      presumably because of the persistence of other cardiovascular risk factors. A recent study&#xD;
      has confirmed that French patients with T2DM present an overall mortality risk significantly&#xD;
      higher than the general population. In France, this group registered a mortality of 32 deaths&#xD;
      per 1000 persons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bariatric surgery is now a recognized method for the treatment of severe obesity. It allows&#xD;
      for the permanent loss of at least 50% of initial excess weight. In obese patients, this&#xD;
      surgery is also associated with a significant reduction in cardiovascular risk factors and&#xD;
      particularly T2D. A recent meta-analysis of retrospective studies available suggests that&#xD;
      surgery results in remission of T2DM in over 75% of cases. The only prospective randomized&#xD;
      study showed that gastric restriction by placing a gastric band, provides better glycemic&#xD;
      control than just medical treatment in obese patients with recently discovered T2DM. The&#xD;
      gastric by-pass (GBP) which also includes an intestinal by-pass, seems to have an even higher&#xD;
      metabolic efficiency than gastric bypass alone. In patients with T2DM, the GBP restores&#xD;
      postprandial insulin secretion independently of weight loss. Despite the significant&#xD;
      morbidity of the intervention, long-term results seem broadly supportive of the GBP. In a&#xD;
      large case-control study, GBP was associated with a decrease of 90% of deaths related to&#xD;
      diabetes. In a controlled study conducted in surgical candidates obese diabetics, the GBP&#xD;
      decreased the overall world mortality by 75% after 6 years. Despite these very encouraging&#xD;
      data, the GBP is now proposed to only a small proportion (&lt; 1%) of patients likely to benefit&#xD;
      from the procedure.&#xD;
