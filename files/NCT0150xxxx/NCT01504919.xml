      Day 1 Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found eligible to take part in this study, the following tests and procedures will&#xD;
      be performed on Day 1 (the same day you complete the screening tests and sign this consent&#xD;
      form):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked to complete some computer-based questionnaires or paper/pencil&#xD;
           questionnaires that will include questions about your feelings, moods, and smoking&#xD;
           status. These will take 60-90 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have your height, weight, and waistline measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your blood pressure will be measured by a trained research staff member&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete a breath test to help researchers estimate (guess) the amount of&#xD;
           cigarette smoke you inhale. The breath test uses a disposable cardboard tube that is&#xD;
           attached to a machine, and you will be asked to blow a long, slow, steady breath into&#xD;
           it.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be given an accelerometer to wear for 7 days. An accelerometer is a small&#xD;
           device that is worn on the waistline of your pants that measures your level of physical&#xD;
           activity. After 7 days, you will be asked to &quot;turn off&quot; and mail back the accelerometer&#xD;
           using a prepaid envelope provided by the study staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will give a saliva sample at this visit. To collect the saliva sample, you will&#xD;
           place a piece of cotton in your mouth for 3 minutes. The saliva sample is used to check&#xD;
           the amount of cotinine in the body. Cotinine is a chemical that is produced in your&#xD;
           saliva when your body breaks down nicotine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups and Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Day 1 study visit, you will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) into 1 of&#xD;
      2 study groups. There is an equal chance of being assigned to either group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in both groups will receive health education on Day 1, and again 6 and 12 months&#xD;
      later. You can also ask to receive a 6-week supply of nicotine patches, whenever you are&#xD;
      ready to try to quit smoking and a home-based exercise kit when you are ready to begin an&#xD;
      exercise program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Day 1 health education session, the following will take place:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a brief counseling session with a study staff member to talk about&#xD;
           smoking, diet, and your physical activity level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be offered referrals to available resources for help with your smoking&#xD;
           cessation, diet, and physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be given a home-based exercise kit, along with self-help materials that are&#xD;
           designed to help you learn how to quit smoking and how to improve your diet and physical&#xD;
           activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Months 6 and 12 health education sessions, the Day 1 activities will be repeated, and&#xD;
      the following procedures will also take place:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete a computer-based or paper/pencil questionnaire about your mood, diet,&#xD;
           and physical activity. This will take 60-90 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your weight and waistline will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete a breath test. The breath test uses a disposable cardboard tube that&#xD;
           is attached to a machine, and you will be asked to blow a long, slow, steady breath into&#xD;
           it.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will give a saliva sample. To collect the saliva sample, you will place a piece of&#xD;
           cotton in your mouth for 3 minutes. The saliva sample is used to check the amount of&#xD;
           cotinine in the body. Cotinine is a chemical that is produced in your saliva when your&#xD;
           body breaks down nicotine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be given an accelerometer to wear for 7 days. After 7 days, you will mail back&#xD;
           the accelerometer using a prepaid envelope provided by the study staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will also have a follow-up study visit at Month 18. During this visit, the same&#xD;
      procedures from the Month 12 visit will be performed. However, you will not have a health&#xD;
      education session at Month 18.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wellness Program:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the health education visits and materials, participants in Group 2 will also&#xD;
      take part in the wellness program. For the wellness program, you will receive 18 counseling&#xD;
      phone calls over the 18 months you are on study. Each of these phone calls should last about&#xD;
      20-30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The telephone counseling sessions will be digitally recorded. Audio recordings will be erased&#xD;
      once the data have been published. The recordings will be used to help the researchers make&#xD;
      sure that the counselors are following the correct procedures and may be used in the future&#xD;
      to help the researchers better understand or improve the counseling treatment. No one but the&#xD;
      researchers and their staff will be allowed to view or listen to the recordings, and the&#xD;
      identity of the participants will be kept strictly confidential. Your study identification&#xD;
      number will be stated by the counselor at the beginning of the taped session. The recordings&#xD;
      are stored digitally, encrypted, and password protected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire Data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your questionnaire data will be used for research purposes only. Your responses will not be&#xD;
      shared with your doctor. If you feel you need a doctor's opinion about anything that is asked&#xD;
      about in the questionnaires (such as mental or emotional difficulties or symptoms), please&#xD;
      contact either your personal doctor or the study chair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will remain on the study for up to 18 months. Your participation on this part of the&#xD;
      study will be over once you complete the study visit at Month 18.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other Important Information:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You may be contacted by phone, mail, and/or email at any time while you are taking part&#xD;
           in this study to be reminded about the study visits. You will be asked to give the study&#xD;
           chair the names and contact information for family members and/or friends that the study&#xD;
           staff can contact if they cannot reach you.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the accelerometer is lost or stolen, you will not be responsible for the replacement&#xD;
           cost, but you should tell the study chair right away.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. The nicotine patch is FDA approved and commercially&#xD;
      available. Up to 500 participants overall will take part in this research study. Up to 400&#xD;
      participants will take part in this portion of the study. All will be enrolled at MD&#xD;
      Anderson.&#xD;
