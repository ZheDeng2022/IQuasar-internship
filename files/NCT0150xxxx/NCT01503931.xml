  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The mesolimbic dopaminergic reward system is a key structure underlying addictive behaviour&#xD;
      in alcohol addiction and is under control of prefrontal glutamatergic neurotransmission. The&#xD;
      aim of the present multicenter-study in Berlin, Bonn and Mannheim is to use functional&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in alcohol addiction for endophenotyping in order to study&#xD;
      the relevance of genetic variation, in particular in dopaminergic and glutamatergic genes,&#xD;
      for addiction. The investigators will use a temporal discounting and a cue reactivity&#xD;
      paradigm in alcoholics and healthy controls in order to 1) test the impact of genetic&#xD;
      variation on activation of the mesolimbic system in these populations and to 2) to test their&#xD;
      predictive effects for treatment outcome in alcoholics. The subproject will thus bridge&#xD;
      animal research on genetically determined cue reactivity and human studies in alcoholics.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the investigators will link these results to the measurement of glutamate and&#xD;
      glutamine with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in subproject SP14.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol addiction is one of the most common neuropsychiatric diseases in today's society.&#xD;
      Chronic misuse of alcohol not only causes significant physical and psychological damage in&#xD;
      afflicted individuals, it also represents a serious social and economic problem. Despite the&#xD;
      availability of a range of psychological and medical therapies, the risk of relapse for&#xD;
      dependent individuals remains high even after years of abstinence. New, more effective&#xD;
      therapies are urgently needed. Approximately 50% of the predisposition to develop an alcohol&#xD;
      addiction is genetically inherited. In order to create improved treatment approaches and&#xD;
      novel diagnostic tools, an enhanced knowledge of the genetic basis and biology of alcohol&#xD;
      addiction is a prerequisite.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this multi-centre study is to investigate how and which genetic variations&#xD;
      increase the risk for developing an alcohol-addiction. To achieve this, scientists in Berlin,&#xD;
      Bonn and Mannheim will examine specific brain mechanisms that play important roles in alcohol&#xD;
      dependence. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), a technique that makes it possible&#xD;
      to observe the brain 'at work', will be used to reveal brain mechanisms affected by alcohol&#xD;
      addiction such as the processing of reward and punishment, behaviour control and memory. It&#xD;
      will then be investigated which genes or gene-gene interactions underlie these neuronal&#xD;
      mechanisms. This powerful approach has the potential to uncover 'addiction-pathways' through&#xD;
      which genes affect personality, drinking behaviours and success in staying abstinent via&#xD;
      their influences on neuronal mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A special emphasis of this project lies upon the so-called 'reward system', which processes&#xD;
      naturally rewarding stimuli (e.g. food, sex) and which, in alcohol-dependent individuals,&#xD;
      changes perceptions and behaviours in such a way that they become progressively more focused&#xD;
      on alcohol. Two major neurotransmitters are involved in the workings of the reward system:&#xD;
      'dopamine' and more indirectly 'glutamate'. The project will investigate how dopaminergic and&#xD;
      glutamatergic genes influence the neural mechanisms of reward processing, other neural&#xD;
      mechanisms, personality, drinking behaviours and therapy success. In the long run, this&#xD;
      knowledge might lead to more effective therapies such as the development of new medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This large-scale study will be conducted with several hundreds of alcohol-dependent patients&#xD;
      and non-dependent individuals over a period of five years.&#xD;
