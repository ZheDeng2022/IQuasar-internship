      The purpose of this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To assess safety and tolerability of the HTNV and PUUV DNA vaccines, pWRG/HTN-M(x) and&#xD;
      pWRG/PUUV-M(s2), administered intramuscularly using a TDS-IM electroporation device&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To evaluate clinical immunogenicity of the HTNV and PUUV DNA vaccines, pWRG/HTN-M(x) and&#xD;
      pWRG/PUUV-M(s2), including an assessment of the acute procedure tolerability when&#xD;
      administered with the TDS-IM electroporation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will enroll 3 randomized groups of 9 subjects each, along with 3 alternates, for a&#xD;
      total of 30 subjects. The study will include one group of subjects injected with the HTNV DNA&#xD;
      vaccine, one group injected with the PUUV DNA vaccine, and one group injected with both HTNV&#xD;
      and PUUV DNA vaccines (mixed), administered with the Ichor TDS-IM device. Subjects will&#xD;
      receive one dose of vaccine on Days 0, 28, and 56 and will be followed until Day 240.&#xD;
      Subjects will complete post-injection memory aids for 14 days after each injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be evaluated for safety and immune response throughout the study.&#xD;

    <description>The endpoint used to measure immunogenicity of the HTNV and PUUV DNA vaccines is the production of neutralizing antibody titers to HTNV and PUUV (PRNT50 ≥ 1:20). Initial immunogenicity results will be analyzed on the basis of intention-to-treat, in which the outcomes of all subjects who had at least one dose of vaccine will be analyzed with the group to which they were originally assigned, regardless of whether they completed the study. Subsequently, all subjects who completed the 8-month study and have serologic data will be included in the analysis of immunogenicity.</description>
