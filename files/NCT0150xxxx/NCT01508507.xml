  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Various field studies has found that the modified , bivalent, whole cell - based oral cholera&#xD;
      vaccine (OCV) to be safe, immunogenic and effective with protective efficacy of 67 % in&#xD;
      earlier clinical trials. However, the effectiveness of the vaccine in &quot;real&quot; life situation&#xD;
      using the public health system is unknown. It is critical to follow up in the same&#xD;
      population, where pilot introduction of OCV was introduced and evaluate vaccine proactive&#xD;
      effectiveness at individual as well as at population level. The follow - up and determination&#xD;
      of effectiveness of mass OCV vaccination was requested by State Government.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to evaluate the protective effectiveness of one or two&#xD;
      doses of modified, bivalent, killed whole cell based OCV, given at least 14 days apart, when&#xD;
      delivered through community - based mass vaccination campaign using existing public health&#xD;
      infrastructure in a high - risk population in Satyabadi block of Puri district, Orissa,&#xD;
      India.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has following objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      * To evaluate the individual level protective effectiveness of one or two doses of OCV&#xD;
      against culture confirmed cholera episodes, severe enough to seek a formal health care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate population - level effectiveness (herd effects)of OCV delivered through a&#xD;
           community based mass vaccination when the vaccine is delivered to more than half of&#xD;
           population at risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine inverse correlation between vaccine coverage and cholera incidence among&#xD;
           diverse geographical clusters.&#xD;

      plated directly into TCBS agar as well as after enrichment in APW for 6 to 20 hours (pH 8.6,&#xD;
      37 degree centrigrade). After this overnight incubation, suspected colonies from TCBS will be&#xD;
      tested biochemically and agglutinated with polyvalent, Ogawa and Inaba antisera. Biotyping of&#xD;
      O1 isolates will be done with chicken erythrocyte agglunitation tests and determination of&#xD;
      polymyxin sensitivity. Non - agglunating strains will be tested with antiserum to V cholarae&#xD;
