  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to collect information on the side effects of proton&#xD;
      therapy and the details of proton treatment plans so that researchers can develop a method to&#xD;
      predict the risk of side effects and to improve the planning and delivery of proton treatment&#xD;
      for patients in the future.&#xD;

      If you agree to take part in this study, researchers will gather information about your&#xD;
      treatment and treatment outcomes and store it electronically in a database. By carefully&#xD;
      evaluating the data about your treatment, researchers may improve proton treatment for&#xD;
      patients in the future. There will be no change to your recommended standard of care and&#xD;
      follow-up studies. The treatment information and follow-up information will be stored in a&#xD;
      database. The information will then be available at a later date for researchers to study.&#xD;
      The database will be stored on a secure information network, and only those people who are&#xD;
      involved with this research and who have prior approval from the study doctor will have&#xD;
      access to it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will request information from the follow-up visits that you have as part of your&#xD;
      standard of care yearly or more often and test results for at least 10-15 years. The tests&#xD;
      may be performed at other clinics, but MD Anderson researchers will request that the results&#xD;
      be sent to them at MD Anderson.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Proton radiotherapy is FDA approved. Researchers hope to&#xD;
      enroll all children who will be treated with proton radiotherapy at MD Anderson on this study&#xD;
      so that as much information as possible will be gathered. Up to 1000 patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;

For each late normal-tissue endpoint considered, analyses will be performed using censored time-to-event data corresponding to specified levels of injury (e.g. time to a specific grade &gt;= 2 late toxicity).</description>
