    <textblock>
      This study will enroll patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-EGFR mutated&#xD;
      Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) lung cancer after failure of at least one but no more than&#xD;
      two prior approved treatment regimens. Patients will be randomized to receive one of two&#xD;
      doses of vaccine or placebo to be dosed twice weekly for 18 weeks (36 doses total) and&#xD;
      patients will also receive erlotinib 150mg taken orally once daily for the duration of the&#xD;
      trial. The study will examine the immune effects, safety and efficacy of two different doses&#xD;
      of HS110 vaccine in combination with erlotinib versus erlotinib alone.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will enroll patients&#xD;
      with advanced NSCLC (squamous cell or non-squamous cell) without EGFR mutations (either L858R&#xD;
      or 746-750 deletions) who have had progression or recurrence of their disease following at&#xD;
      least one but no more than two prior regimens (adjuvant therapy excluded) of approved therapy&#xD;
      that did not include immunomodulating or anti-EGFR targeted therapy for their disease. EFGR&#xD;
      status must be known at the time of enrollment either via prior determination or testing&#xD;
      performed from archival tissue during the screening process. Patients with resectable disease&#xD;
      will eligible if resection can be deferred for the first six weeks of vaccine. Patients will&#xD;
      receive twice weekly dosing of vaccine (spatially divided as 5 intradermal injections) for 18&#xD;
      weeks (36 total doses). Patients will be randomized in a 2:1 fashion; with 30 patients in&#xD;
      each of the HS110 treatments groups (high and low dose) and 15 patients will receive placebo&#xD;
      injections. Patients will also receive erlotinib 150mg once daily for the duration of the&#xD;
      trial. A total of 75 patients will be enrolled in the trial. The study includes a lead-in&#xD;
      phase of 9 patients (3 from each dosing group) who will be observed weekly for 4 weeks to&#xD;
      assess the safety of combining HS110 with erlotinib. Treatment of the first 4 patients will&#xD;
      be staggered by 2 week intervals to allow for safety evaluation before treating additional&#xD;
      patients. If the combination of proves to be safe and well-tolerated in the first 9 patients,&#xD;
      enrollment will be opened up to the predetermined sample size for each arm. A Data Monitoring&#xD;
      Committee (DMC) will be used in this study to independently monitor adverse events and&#xD;
      progression/survival data. The DMC will meet at the completion of the run-in period and after&#xD;
      half the patients have been dosed through week 6 and week 12.&#xD;
