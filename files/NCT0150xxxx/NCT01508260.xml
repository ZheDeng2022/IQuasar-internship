  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn about the safety and level of&#xD;
      effectiveness of aquapheresis compared to diuretic drugs. Diuretic drugs are designed to help&#xD;
      the kidneys to form more urine. They also remove fluids from patients with severe fluid&#xD;
      overload who have not responded to diuretics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aquapheresis is a procedure that removes excess fluid from the body. Blood containing too&#xD;
      much salt and water is withdrawn from the body using catheters (sterile flexible tubes) and&#xD;
      passed through a special filter. The filter separates the excess salt and water from the&#xD;
      blood. The blood is returned to the patient and the fluid is collected in a bag to be&#xD;
      disposed. Aquapherisis may benefit patients by removing excess fluid and salt from the body.&#xD;

      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study&#xD;
      group based on when you join this study. The first group of 10 participants to join the study&#xD;
      will be enrolled in the Pilot portion of the study. The next group of up to 40 participants&#xD;
      will be enrolled in the Randomized portion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Pilot portion of the study, researchers want to learn about the safety and level of&#xD;
      effectiveness of aquapheresis in leukemia patients with severe fluid overload who do not&#xD;
      respond to diuretics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in the Randomized portion of the study, you will be randomly assigned (as in the&#xD;
      flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 groups. You will have an equal chance of being assigned to each&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group A will receive aquapheresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group B will receive furosemide. The doctor will discuss this with you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in Group A, you will be connected to the aquapheresis pump through an intravenous&#xD;
      (IV) catheter placed in your forearm. The pump looks like the ones used to infuse IV drugs.&#xD;
      It will hang on a pole by your bed. About 6 teaspoons of your blood will flow through the&#xD;
      blood circuit, and the excess fluid will slowly be collected in the collection bag. The exact&#xD;
      length of time of aquapheresis treatment is determined by how much fluid needs to be removed&#xD;
      and how fast it can be removed. The average treatment is about 24 hours but can extend up to&#xD;
      7 days. About 6 liters or 13 pounds will be removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in Group B, you will receive one of the following for as the doctor thinks it is&#xD;
      needed (until most of the excess fluid is removed):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  furosemide by vein over about 15 minutes every 8 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  furosemide by vein as a continuous (non-stop) infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will be given other standard of care drugs such as&#xD;
      albumin and metolazone to help your kidneys to make more urine. The study staff will tell you&#xD;
      about these drugs, how they will be given, and the possible risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every day while you are receiving aquapheresis or diuretic treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any symptoms you may be having.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs (blood&#xD;
           pressure, heart rate, and breathing rate) and weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked how much you drank. The study staff will measure how much you urinate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your leg will be measured for swelling due to fluid retention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least every other day, blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a chest x-ray on Day 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in Group A, you will remain on study treatment for as long as the doctor thinks it&#xD;
      is needed (possibly about 1-7 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in Group B, you will receive standard treatment for as long as your doctor thinks&#xD;
      it is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will no longer be able to receive the study treatment (Group A) or you will be taken off&#xD;
      study (Group B) if intolerable side effects occur or if you are unable to follow study&#xD;
      directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on the study will be over once you have completed the end-of-study&#xD;
      follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Treatment Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After you stop taking the study treatment or standard treatment, the following tests and&#xD;
      procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any symptoms you may be having.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs and weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked how much you drank. The study staff will measure how much you urinate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your leg will be measured for swelling due to fluid retention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a chest x-ray.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Study Follow-up Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 30 days after the end of study therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs and weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any symptoms you may be having.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your leg will be measured for swelling due to fluid retention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. The Aquadex FlexFlow™ Fluid Removal Systems pump used for&#xD;
      aquapheresis is FDA approved and commercially available for patients with fluid overload.&#xD;
      Using the Aquadex FlexFlow™ Fluid Removal Systems pump in patients with leukemia to remove&#xD;
      excess fluid is investigational. Furosemide is FDA approved and commercially available for&#xD;
      other uses such as the treatment of swelling caused by heart failure or kidney or liver&#xD;
      problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 50 patients will be enrolled in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
