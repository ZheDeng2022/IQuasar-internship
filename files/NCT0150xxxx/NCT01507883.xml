      Current human IVF technology employs two strategies with respective culture media for embryo&#xD;
      development; 'let the embryo choose' (utilizes single step media) and 'back-to-nature'&#xD;
      (utilizes sequential media). To our knowledge, there is not any sibling oocyte study to&#xD;
      evaluate potential advantages/disadvantages of these strategies on one another.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Maintaining optimal embryo development during in vitro culture is a key element in assisted&#xD;
      reproduction treatments. Whether the concept of mimicking in vivo environment is a 'must' in&#xD;
      order not to compromise outcome is a matter of debate since 'let the embryo choose' strategy&#xD;
      has been shown to perform at least as good as the 'back to nature' in several studies.'Let&#xD;
      the embryo choose&quot; approach utilizes a milieu with relatively constant concentration of&#xD;
      ingredients (single culture system) as compared to the latter, in which demands of the&#xD;
      embryos are supported according to their passage from the Fallopian tubes to the uterus in a&#xD;
      sequential culture media. Basic differences between these ingredients are; presence of (1)&#xD;
      glucose instead of pyruvate, and (2) essential aminoacids in early embryo stages (until day&#xD;
      3) in single step media, and (3) presence of EDTA in sequential media.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vast majority of these results were obtained from studies where patients have been randomized&#xD;
      into groups instead of employing a sibling (oocyte/embryo) model which could have enabled&#xD;
      each patient to serve as her own control. In fact, it has been claimed that introducing a&#xD;
      sibling oocyte study design could give a methodological problem at the time of fertilization&#xD;
      since different type of culture media vary in osmolarity. Likewise the only study that&#xD;
      employed a sibling oocyte model utilized two different media (home-made versus G1.2/G1.2)&#xD;
      although the osmolarity of the former had been adjusted to 280-285 mOsm). This study reported&#xD;
      no significant differences in day3/5 embryo development as well as pregnancy/implantation&#xD;
      rates between groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequent studies, however, favoured single step media, as they found higher proportion of&#xD;
      compacted embryos to zygotes at day3, morula at 4, a higher blastocyst yield, an overall&#xD;
      higher utilization rate after day5 and an improved implantation rate when compared to&#xD;
      sequential media. Yet, besides potential variation of gamete qualities between patients&#xD;
      allocated to groups (as described above), differences in static observation times of embryos&#xD;
      between laboratories could have affected the results in these studies. Current introduction&#xD;
      of time-lapse equipment into human assisted reproduction technology enabled a more distinct&#xD;
      definition of embryo development and it is now possible to quantify pace of embryo cleavage&#xD;
      in various media. Such a definition is also useful to determine the predictive value of&#xD;
      embryo development in pre-defined time points will be applicable to all embryology&#xD;
      laboratories using various culture systems.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cycles which have gone through egg retrieval procedure between March to November 2011&#xD;
             were included into the study.There was no restriction on the number of previous trials&#xD;
             and/or sperm source.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The maximum number of retrieved oocytes was restricted to 12 and the minimum to 2, as&#xD;
             the former was the capacity of one dish (EmbryoSlideâ„¢) in which oocytes/embryos could&#xD;
             be placed and the latter was the minimum number to be able to make a comparison&#xD;
             between groups. Women who were older than 40 years of age were excluded in order to&#xD;
             minimize the impact of increased risk of aneuploidy on the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cycles in which oocytes/embryos have been subjected to biopsy were also excluded due&#xD;
             to the potential risk of delayed embryo development in such cases (Kirkegaard et al.,&#xD;
             2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Furthermore, cycles in which diagnosis of infertility was endometrial factor were not&#xD;
             included since such aetiology could negatively affect implantation despite good embryo&#xD;
             development.&#xD;
