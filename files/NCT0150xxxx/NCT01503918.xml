    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether reactivation of latent cytomegalovirus&#xD;
      infection in critically ill patients looked after in the intensive care unit can be&#xD;
      successfully and safely prevented using antiviral agents. Comparison is made between standard&#xD;
      care, and treatment with one of two different antiviral regimens: valaciclovir/aciclovir,&#xD;
      which has a favourable side effect profile but requires high dosage to be effective, and&#xD;
      valganciclovir/ganciclovir, which has more side effects, but has been demonstrated to be&#xD;
      effective in low dosage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis is that cytomegalovirus reactivation can be effectively suppressed&#xD;
      with antiviral prophylaxis.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      * Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common virus which infects around half the UK population.&#xD;
      Infection is usually mild, but after infection the virus is never completely eradicated, and&#xD;
      may reactivate in ill health. Reactivation is most commonly seen in those with compromised&#xD;
      immune systems, such as people with advanced HIV infection, or whilst on immunosuppression&#xD;
      following organ transplantation. CMV reactivation in these patients can be life threatening.&#xD;
      There is evidence to support the use of antiviral medication in these groups of&#xD;
      immunosuppressed patients to prevent CMV reactivation, and their use is part of standard&#xD;
      therapy. There is increasing evidence demonstrating that a third of critically ill patients&#xD;
      will reactivate CMV, and these patients have as much as a doubled mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      * This study is a proof of concept study designed to assess whether antiviral prophylaxis can&#xD;
      effectively and safely suppress CMV reactivation in CMV seropositive high risk critically ill&#xD;
      patients. Antiviral prophylaxis is currently not standard practice in critical care units,&#xD;
      and no previous trials of prophylaxis have been undertaken in this setting. All commonly used&#xD;
      antiviral agents have side effects, and it is important to demonstrate their efficacy and&#xD;
      safety in the critical care setting before undertaking a large multicentre trial powered to&#xD;
      identify mortality or morbidity differences with prophylaxis. Intravenous ganciclovir, and&#xD;
      its oral prodrug valganciclovir have been effectively used as prophylaxis at low doses in&#xD;
      immunosuppressed patients. Intravenous aciclovir and its oral prodrug valaciclovir in high&#xD;
      dosage have also been demonstrated to be effective as prophylaxis in immunosuppressed&#xD;
      patients. This study sets out to determine whether their use in critically ill patients are&#xD;
      both effective and safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan of Investigation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      * This is a prospective, randomised, open-label single centre study. Patients admitted to the&#xD;
      Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham critical care unit, and identified by study criteria to&#xD;
      be at high risk of CMV reactivation will be assessed for inclusion into the study. Blood will&#xD;
      be analysed for CMV antibodies to establish eligibility. Recruited patients will be&#xD;
      randomised to receive high dose aciclovir/valaciclovir, or low dose&#xD;
      ganciclovir/valganciclovir for the duration of their critical care stay, for a maximum of 28&#xD;
      days, or to enter the control group receiving standard care. CMV viral load by polymerase&#xD;
      chain reaction (PCR) will be measured in blood, throat swab, urine, and sputum via&#xD;
      non-directed bronchiolar lavage (NDBL) twice weekly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Impact:&#xD;
&#xD;
      * Latent CMV infection is common, affecting around half of all adults in the UK. Evidence&#xD;
      demonstrates that a third of these patients will reactivate leading to CMV viraemia when&#xD;
      critically ill. Epidemiological data from multiple independent groups have identified a&#xD;
      doubling in mortality in this group, although a causal link between CMV reactivation and&#xD;
      mortality without a trial of antiviral drugs can not be assumed. From these figures, it is&#xD;
      estimated that 16.5% of critically ill patients (current mortality rates of around 40%) may&#xD;
      benefit from antiviral prophylaxis. Almost no patients are receiving prophylaxis or screening&#xD;
      for reactivation worldwide in this group. Demonstration of mortality or morbidity&#xD;
      improvements could potentially change worldwide intensive care practice.&#xD;
