  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mainly due to the absence of gravitational forces in weightlessness, astronauts suffer from&#xD;
      an increased bone loss- negatively affecting health and vitality during a mission. The&#xD;
      development of effective countermeasures to this loss includes many different aspects like&#xD;
      sports but also nutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alkaline salts, abundant in fruits and vegetables, have shown to have positive effects on&#xD;
      markers of bone turnover of postmenopausal women but also men and younger adults. With the&#xD;
      current study the effects of a potassium bicarbonate supplementation added to a standardised,&#xD;
      strictly controlled, definite diet of healthy, young men, should be verified within 21 days&#xD;
      of 6°- HDT- Bedrest- the gold standard of simulating weightlessness within earthbound&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Astronauts in space suffer from an increased bone loss which is mainly related to the absence&#xD;
      of gravitational forces. This increased bone reduction is accompanied by an higher&#xD;
      concentration of calcium in urine and in this respect enhancing the risk of renal stones. Due&#xD;
      to the fact, that bones´ regeneration does not occur rapidly even after returning to earth,&#xD;
      astronauts face an increased risk of osteoporosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutritional factors such as a deficient intake of calcium, energy and fluid and the abundant&#xD;
      intake of table salt exhibit additional negative effects on bone. Results of several studies&#xD;
      consistently show the negative effects of acids on bone (increased bone loss). With respect&#xD;
      to space missions of longer duration one big challenge is the development of countermeasures&#xD;
      for the negative consequences of weightlessness on bone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As not all needed experiments for the development of countermeasures can be conducted in&#xD;
      space, simulation models of weightlessness such as 6° Head- Down- Tilt- Bedrest (HDT-&#xD;
      Bedrest) have been implemented on earth, miming some physiological conditions of&#xD;
      weightlessness such as unloading and immobilisation of the lower parts of the body and the&#xD;
      fluid shift.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alkaline salts, such as potassium bicarbonate (KHCO3), demonstrate positive effects on bone&#xD;
      when being supplemented to postmenopausal women. Apart from the positive effects on markers&#xD;
      of bone turnover, calcium concentration in urine could be reduced. Thus, the main aim of the&#xD;
      present study was to reduce the immobilization induced bone resorption through an alkalizing&#xD;
      effect of the alkaline salt KHCO3's supplementation during Head- Down- Tilt- Bedrest (HDT-&#xD;
      Bedrest)-a leading simulation model of weightlessness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The crossover designed study consisted of two parts of equal length (36 days)- 7 days of&#xD;
      adaptation, 21 days of HDT- Bedrest, 6 days recovery and 2 days of long- term follow- up.&#xD;
      Both study parts only differed in the HDT- period, where one group of the 8 healthy, young,&#xD;
      male participating subjects was supplemented with 90 mmol KHCO3 daily (3 times a day 30 mmol&#xD;
      KHCO3 diluted in 200 ml tab water, supplemented together with the main meals), while the&#xD;
      other group only received 200 ml of tab water without any supplementation (Control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The measurements of bone formation markers as well as bone resorption markers in blood and&#xD;
      urine supply insight into the influences of the supplementation on bone metabolism while&#xD;
      blood gas analysis together with the pH- values of the 24h- urine point out the alkalising&#xD;
      effects of KHCO3. Further physiological systems like protein and muscle metabolism, body&#xD;
      weight and body composition, circulation and the neuro- vestibular system are simultaneously&#xD;
      under investigation.&#xD;
