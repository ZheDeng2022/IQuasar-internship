      Limb apraxia is defined as the inability to correctly perform skilled and/or learned limb&#xD;
      movements, which cannot be explained by elementary motor and sensory deficits or cognitive&#xD;
      problems. Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous&#xD;
      system and the leading cause of disability in young adults. Apraxia and impaired manual&#xD;
      dexterity are common problems in patients with MS leading to impaired activities of daily&#xD;
      living. However, a specific training program to improve apraxia as well as manual dexterity&#xD;
      in MS is lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators want to evaluate the impact of a targeted occupational&#xD;
      therapy program on apraxia and manual dexterity in patients with MS that have dexterity&#xD;
      problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients routinely seen in the investigators MS consulting hour, fulfilling all inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria and willing to participate in the study will be evaluated for Apraxia and&#xD;
      manual dexterity. In case of Apraxia and/or impaired manual dexterity, patients will be&#xD;
      randomized 1:1 using sealed envelopes to receive occupational home therapy (experimental&#xD;
      group) or general physical exercises (control group) for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At study entry and study end after 4 weeks, apraxia and manual dexterity will be tested in&#xD;
      all patients.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Limb apraxia is defined as the inability to correctly perform skilled and/or learned limb&#xD;
      movements, which cannot be explained by elementary motor and sensory deficits or cognitive&#xD;
      problems. It impairs real object/tool use as well as pantomime and imitation of gestures&#xD;
      affecting both sides of the body and can be a major source of disability independent of other&#xD;
      neurological deficits. It significantly affects activities of daily living (ADL) and is&#xD;
      associated with poorer outcome for independent living or return to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apraxia is largely based on left parieto-frontal damage due to focal injury or more&#xD;
      widespread neurodegeneration of cortical areas and/or their connections. However, apraxia has&#xD;
      been described in damage of the right hemisphere, although less frequent and severe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apraxia is increasingly recognized as a clinical problem in restorative neurology and various&#xD;
      approaches were described how to treat the disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system and&#xD;
      the leading cause of disability in young adults. It is characterized by focal demyelination&#xD;
      as well as axonal damage. MS has been classically thought of as a typical white matter&#xD;
      disorder. However, early pathology studies and recent magnetic resonance tomography (MRI)&#xD;
      studies show demyelination in the cortex and deep gray matter nuclei. Grey matter damage&#xD;
      starts early in the disease and substantially affects cognitive functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apraxia and impaired manual dexterity are common problems in MS leading to impaired&#xD;
      activities of daily living. However, a specific training program to improve apraxia and&#xD;
      manual dexterity in MS is lacking. In this study, we want to evaluate the impact of a&#xD;
      targeted occupational therapy program on apraxia and manual dexterity in patients with MS&#xD;
      that have dexterity problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a rater-blind, randomized, controlled trial. Patients routinely seen in our MS&#xD;
      consulting hour, fulfilling all inclusion and exclusion criteria and willing to participate&#xD;
      in the study will be evaluated for Apraxia using the AST (Apraxia Screen of TULIA). In case&#xD;
      of Apraxia patients will be randomized 1:1 using sealed envelopes to receive occupational&#xD;
      home therapy (experimental group) or general physical exercises (control group) for 4 weeks&#xD;
      (4 times 5 days in a row).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At study entry and study end after 4 weeks, apraxia will be tested in all patients using the&#xD;
      extended version of the AST, the TULIA. Furthermore, a questionnaire on &quot;activities of daily&#xD;
      living&quot; and &quot;quality of life&quot; will be evaluated, and test regarding cognition, spasticity,&#xD;
      ataxia, fatigue as well as the EDSS will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the impact of a targeted occupational therapy program on apraxia and manual&#xD;
      dexterity in patients with MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      see above.&#xD;
