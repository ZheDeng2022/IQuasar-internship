      The primary objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the pharmacokinetic profiles of RhuDex administered as two novel oral&#xD;
           formulations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify the lead formulation and optimise the pharmacokinetic profile by modifying&#xD;
           the quantitative composition of that formulation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optional: To assess the intravenous pharmacokinetics of RhuDex following administration&#xD;
           of an IV microtracer of [14C]RhuDex&#xD;

    <description>All target PK evaluations will be made on the basis that the optimal plasma PK profile will be characterised by a plasma Cmax &lt; 5000 ng/mL, an elimination half-life of &gt; 8h and a C(last) (24h) of around 800-1000 ng/mL. Formulations will explicity not be selected based on determinations of Cmax or AUC(0-inf) alone</description>

    <description>Part 1:&#xD;
Regimen A: Rhudex Formulation in Labrafac/ Gelucire Regimen B: Rhudex Formulation in Labrafac/ Aerosil single dose&#xD;
The formulation platform (A or B) that shows the best potential to achieve the target PK profile and shows acceptable safety and tolerability will be progressed into part 2 of the study. The purpose of part 2 is to optimize the selected formulation platform. This will be achieved by administrating up to four different formulation compositions.</description>
