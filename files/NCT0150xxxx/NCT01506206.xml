    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a test of causality by examining a cohort of patients undergoing&#xD;
      deep brain stimulation (DBS) within the ventral striatum. The investigators will examine&#xD;
      behavior on and off stimulation across a range of tasks that index different forms of&#xD;
      impulsivity. Patients will be studied in both the ON and OFF state - that is, they will be&#xD;
      tested during active deep brain stimulation and 30 min to 1 hour after stimulation has been&#xD;
      stopped (order of state will be counterbalanced across subjects). The investigators specific&#xD;
      aim is to test the hypothesis that enhancing ventral striatal signaling (i.e. ON-state DBS)&#xD;
      will cause more impulsive patterns of behavior across several impulsivity tasks. The&#xD;
      investigators predict that ventral striatal DBS will increase stop-signal reaction time on&#xD;
      the stop-signal task and commission errors on the Go/NoGo task, and increase delay aversion&#xD;
      in a delay discounting paradigm.&#xD;

      The study will take place at a clinical office in the Charlestown Navy Yard (CNY), and will&#xD;
      consist of 1 4 or 4.5-hour visit. Study staff will schedule a convenient time for patients to&#xD;
      arrive, or the research visit may be paired with a regularly scheduled DBS programming visit.&#xD;
      A member of the Division of Neurotherapeutics authorized to manipulate DBS programming will&#xD;
      turn the device ON and OFF during the study. The subject's therapeutic parameters of the DBS&#xD;
      system will not be changed. The subject will be asked to complete two impulsivity&#xD;
      questionnaires: UPPS+P Impulsive Behavior Scale and the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11).&#xD;
      Following these questionnaires, DBS stimulation will be turned off and a member of the study&#xD;
      staff will teach the subjects to perform the following tasks on the computer:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stop-Signal Task To measure &quot;impulsive action,&quot; we will use the stop-signal task (SST), a&#xD;
      well-validated measure of response inhibition known to be impaired in substance abusers. In&#xD;
      each of the 192 trials (3 blocks of 64; 10s interval between blocks, 2s ISI), subjects see a&#xD;
      fixation cue (250ms) that is replaced by a shape (square or circle). Participants are told to&#xD;
      make a shape judgment by pressing the appropriate computer key. On no-signal trials (75%),&#xD;
      subjects are instructed to respond to the stimulus as fast and accurately as possible. On&#xD;
      stop-signal trials (25%), the stimulus is followed by an auditory stop signal, and subjects&#xD;
      are instructed to withhold responding. On stop-signal trials, a stop signal is presented&#xD;
      after a variable delay (SSD), initially set at 250 msec and adjusted continuously with a&#xD;
      staircase procedure by 50ms depending on whether inhibition is successful (increases) or&#xD;
      unsuccessful (decreases). The paradigm will be administered using precompiled software&#xD;
      provided by Gordon Logan, which automatically analyzes all relevant dependent variables (e.g&#xD;
      stop-signal reaction time [SSRT] and GoRT). This task takes approximately 20 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rewarded Variant This task is a variant of the above, with an inclusion of a &quot;points possible&#xD;
      cue&quot; (2 or 50 points) for 500 ms, and followed by a brief delay (500-1500 ms) prior to the&#xD;
      target. The task will be presented in 13 blocks. The first contains only go trials, from&#xD;
      which the initial SSD will be calculated. The 12 subsequent blocks each consist of 40 trials;&#xD;
      18 standard go trials, 12 high reward (HR) go trials, 6 standard stop trials, and 4 HR stop&#xD;
      trials, presented in random order. The SSD will be determined by a simple staircase-tracking&#xD;
      algorithm as described by Logan, in which the SSD is adjusted up or down by 25 ms in order to&#xD;
      establish an SSD that produces 50% accuracy of successful performance, with separate&#xD;
      staircases calculated for the HR and standard trials. Outcome measures are the standard and&#xD;
      high reward GoRTs, the standard and HR SSRTs, and the proportion of responses that would have&#xD;
      been unsuccessfully stopped on HR trials if the standard SSD were utilized instead of the HR&#xD;
      SSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rewarded Go/NoGo Task In this task, participants are asked to make, or withhold, a button&#xD;
      press to one of six stimuli (shapes), that correspond to six trial types: Go (no reward), Go&#xD;
      (low reward), Go (high reward), NoGo (no reward), NoGo (low reward), NoGo (high reward).&#xD;
      Participants are asked to press a button for Go stimuli and withhold a button press for NoGo&#xD;
      stimuli. The ratio of Go stimuli to NoGo stimuli is approximately 15:1. Participants win&#xD;
      money for correctly pressing a button for Go stimuli and for withholding a response for NoGo&#xD;
      stimuli; conversely, they lose money for failing to respond to a Go stimuli or for failing to&#xD;
      withhold a response to NoGo stimuli. There are 1260 trials, and each lasts 1 second. The task&#xD;
      takes about 20 minutes to complete. Task may be administered without reward contingencies. In&#xD;
      this case, there will only be two trial types: Go and NoGo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delay Discounting Task To measure &quot;impulsive choice&quot; we will use a delay-discounting (DD)&#xD;
      paradigm101. On each trial, participants make a binary choice between a smaller/sooner and a&#xD;
      larger/later reward. The delay of the sooner reward is set as today, 2 weeks, &amp; 1 month; the&#xD;
      delay of the later reward ranges from 2 to 6 weeks after the early reward. The sooner reward&#xD;
      is from 1% to 50% less than the late reward (max = $40). Participants will complete&#xD;
      approximately 80 trials. Participants are told that two of their choices will be randomly&#xD;
      selected for payout at the appropriate time. Outcome variables include the proportion of&#xD;
      choices for immediate/sooner rewards, as well as discounting parameter k, obtained by fitting&#xD;
      choice data for each subject to a hyperbolic discount function. The task takes approximately&#xD;
      15 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 minutes after turning OFF DBS stimulation, participants will either remain in the OFF&#xD;
      condition or will have the DBS turned ON, depending on their counter-balanced condition&#xD;
      assignment. Subjects will complete the tasks above in the first condition. Following task&#xD;
      completion, subjects will have DBS stimulation turned OFF or ON (again, depending on&#xD;
      condition assignment). After 30 minutes, participants will complete the same tasks in the&#xD;
      second condition. Following retesting, participants that were in the OFF condition will&#xD;
      return to ON DBS stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will be using the implanted pulse generator to deliver a safe current. Because we are not&#xD;
      changing the therapeutic parameters of stimulation, subjects should not experience any&#xD;
      changes during the ON condition. Should any discomfort arise in the OFF condition, the&#xD;
      subject will be able to terminate the study and return to the ON condition immediately. The&#xD;
      computer will register the subject's performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electroencephalography recordings (EEG) will be acquired during performance of the&#xD;
      aforementioned tasks. Continuous EEG data will be sampled at a maximum of 1024Hz using a&#xD;
      64-electrode cap. Eye movement artifacts will be assessed using bipolar electrodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with just major depressive disorder or obsessive compulsive disorder will also be&#xD;
      recruited as a control group for the patients with deep brain stimulation.&#xD;
