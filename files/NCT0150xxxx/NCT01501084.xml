    <textblock>
      Obesity is a major health problem in the US and many Western countries, with more than half&#xD;
      of the population being overweight or obese. Yet, despite intense research efforts into the&#xD;
      mechanisms underlying obesity and into the development of novel pharmacologic interventions,&#xD;
      bariatric surgery, including gastric bypass surgery is the only successful treatment for&#xD;
      severe obesity. Mimicking one of the effects of bariatric surgery, e.g. the increased&#xD;
      secretion of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) could be an effective strategy against obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obese individuals may be more sensitive to the rewarding aspects of food and less responsive&#xD;
      to signals from the gut about actual energy needs. Using functional MRI scanning the&#xD;
      investigators plan to examine the effect of Exenatide (a GLP-1 analog known to reduce caloric&#xD;
      intake and produce weight loss in both obese and lean individuals) on activity within brain&#xD;
      regions/networks involved in reward/motivation and in regulation of energy requirements. The&#xD;
      investigators expect the peptide to change the balance between desire to eat for pleasure and&#xD;
      the need to eat to maintain homeostasis.&#xD;

      PRIMARY STUDY OBJECTIVE The proposed study aims to address two important questions regarding&#xD;
      the mechanisms underlying the weight loss associated with exenatide. The investigators&#xD;
      primary study objective is to determine whether Exenatide changes the resting state activity&#xD;
      of the brain, and alters the connectivity between brain regions involved in homeostatic and&#xD;
      hedonic brain circuits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY STUDY OBJECTIVE The secondary study objective is to determine if/how these changes&#xD;
      differ between lean and obese subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      SIGNIFICANCE Obesity is a major health problem in the US and many Western countries, with&#xD;
      more than half of the population being overweight or obese. Yet, despite intense research&#xD;
      efforts into the mechanisms underlying obesity and into the development of novel&#xD;
      pharmacologic interventions, bariatric surgery, including gastric bypass surgery is the only&#xD;
      successful treatment for severe obesity (le Roux, 2006; le Roux, 2007). Mimicking one of the&#xD;
      effects of bariatric surgery, e.g. the increased secretion of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1)&#xD;
      could be an effective strategy against obesity (Torekov, 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact of gut peptides on the brain in the regulation of ingestive behavior is an area of&#xD;
      great interest, since the involved signaling mechanisms may be potential targets for the&#xD;
      treatment of obesity. Both endocrine, paracrine and neurocrine (vagal) signaling pathways are&#xD;
      involved in gut to brain signaling of nutrient related information (Holst, 2007). Human&#xD;
      studies have demonstrated that long acting hormones like leptin and insulin act on brain&#xD;
      regions such as the hypothalamus and brainstem, influencing both food intake and response&#xD;
      (Ahima, 2010). More short -term gut signals relayed by hormones such as CCK and PYY have also&#xD;
      been shown in humans to have an effect on subcortical regions (including the hypothalamus,&#xD;
      nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), pons, thalamus) as well as on cortical regions (middle&#xD;
      temporal gyrus, insula and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) (Ahima, 2010). Whereas CCK&#xD;
      infusion in healthy human subjects was found to result in increased activity primarily in&#xD;
      homeostatic brain regions (hypothalamus, brainstem), PYY infusions were associated with&#xD;
      increased activity in regions of reward-circuits (orbitalfrontal cortex, insula, anterior&#xD;
      cingulate cortex). To our knowledge, the central effects of GLP-1 in humans have not been&#xD;
      studied. (Ahima, 2010)&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Exenatide changes intrinsic activity in the NTS and hypothalamus, and connectivity&#xD;
           between NTS and homeostatic and hedonic brain circuits&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. These changes are seen both in lean and in obese subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Changes in the engagement of brain circuits induced by Exenatide are correlated with&#xD;
           increased ratings of satiety following a test meal&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is a double-blind, placebo controlled, crossover study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty healthy female subjects between the ages of 18-40 years are needed The subjects will&#xD;
      be divided into two age-matched groups of obese and lean women. The ten obese females will&#xD;
      have a BMI between 30-35kg/ m2 and the 10 lean females will have a BMI between 19-25kg/m2.&#xD;
      All subjects will be asked to participate in the entire protocol of 3 visits. There will be a&#xD;
      screening visit to determine eligibility followed by two functional MRI visits where the&#xD;
      subject is given a subcutaneous injection (sc) of 10ug of Exenatide (a GLP-1 analog) at one&#xD;
      visit and a an injection of saline at the other MRI visit. The choice of female participants&#xD;
      is based on the greater prevalence of obesity in women and the longstanding interest of the&#xD;
      center's interest in women's health. In order to control for menstrual cycle hormonal&#xD;
      fluctuation all participants will be scanned during the follicular phase of the menstrual&#xD;
      cycle, for this study defined as the 4th-12th day after starting menstruation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening (Visit 1):&#xD;
&#xD;
      All potential subjects will be asked to complete an initial screening visit approximately 1.5&#xD;
      hours of time. This visit will take place at the Gail and Gerald Oppenheimer Family Center&#xD;
      for Neurobiology of Stress at 10833 Le Conte Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90095 Room 47-126. At the&#xD;
      beginning of this visit, the subject will be given ample time to read and sign the informed&#xD;
      consent. The protocol will be discussed and reviewed with a study MD or RN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The screening will include a medical history and physical examination. A urine test for&#xD;
      pregnancy will also be done. If the pregnancy test is positive the subject will be&#xD;
      immediately dropped from participation. Female subjects of child bearing potential will be&#xD;
      asked to practice a medically approved birth control method during the study, including the&#xD;
      oral contraceptive pill, abstinence, double barrier method (spermicide and condoms), or IUD.&#xD;
      A menstrual cycle history will be obtained as part of the medical history and the first day&#xD;
      of their last menses will be documented. fMRI visits will be planned during the follicular&#xD;
      stage- specifically day 4-12 of their cycle. A 5 cc (1 tsp) blood draw for glucose will be&#xD;
      collected. If the non- fasting blood glucose result is more than 200mg/dl the subject will be&#xD;
      considered a screen fail. This value was chosen in order to exclude subjects with undiagnosed&#xD;
      underlying diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to fill out several behavioral questionnaires: the UCLA bowel symptom&#xD;
      questionnaire (BSQ 5.0), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HAD), the Spielberger&#xD;
      State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-Y1 and Y2) and the MRI safety screening&#xD;
      questionnaire; requiring about 20 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RN, NP or MD will review the inclusion and exclusion criteria with the subject to&#xD;
      determine eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A brief structured psychological interview (MINI+) will be done to identify any major Axis I&#xD;
      psychiatric disorders in DSM-IV and ICD-10, such as anxiety, depression, substance abuse or&#xD;
      phobias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the subject is eligible and wishes to participate, they will be provided with instructions&#xD;
      for the following study visit. As noted this visit will be scheduled during the follicular&#xD;
      phase of the individual's menstrual cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 MRI scanning visit 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This visit will take approximately 2 hours of time. Subject will be asked to fast (except&#xD;
      water) for eight hours prior to admission. Eligibility criteria for continuance in the study,&#xD;
      including adverse events and any change in medication usage will be reviewed and recorded.&#xD;
      The 1st day of last menstrual period will be noted and a urine pregnancy test will be&#xD;
      performed. If positive the subject will be removed from study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be escorted to the CTSI (General clinical research area) and an IV will be&#xD;
      placed for the four blood draws. A baseline fasting blood glucose will be done. It needs to&#xD;
      be between 65mg/dl and 126mg/dl or the visit will be cancelled. The subject will then be&#xD;
      escorted to the UCLA Ahmanson-Lovelace Brain Mapping Center, 660 Charles Young Dr. South, Los&#xD;
      Angeles, CA 90095-7085 and prepared for scanning. Subjects will be asked to complete a PROMIS&#xD;
      questionnaire prior to scanning to evaluate the previous nights sleep quality (for RSN&#xD;
      analysis) and a Fullness Questionnaire (FQ); a visual analog scale used to measure hunger and&#xD;
      satiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After wanding for metal safety they will be escorted into the MRI chamber. They will be given&#xD;
      a synopsis of the study tests and prepared for placement in the scanner. They will be&#xD;
      monitored for pulse oximetry and respiratory rate as a measure of autonomic nervous system&#xD;
      and as a safety measure (after Exenatide injection) while scanning. These measures will be&#xD;
      collected during all functional resting state network (RSN) scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following placement structural scans will be done After the structural scans the subject will&#xD;
      undergo a 10-minute resting state (RSN) scan during which then they will be asked to lie&#xD;
      still with their eyes closed but not fall asleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After that RSN scan, subjects will be partially moved out of the scanner to receive either a&#xD;
      subcutaneous injection of 10ug of Exenatide or a 0.5cc injection of saline (placebo) in the&#xD;
      upper arm, thigh or abdomen. Randomization will be done by the UCLA research pharmacy where&#xD;
      the drug is stored and dispensed. Subject and investigator will blinded to the randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately following the injection the subject will be moved back into the scanner and have&#xD;
      a 8.5 minute structural scanner (MP Rage: a three-dimensional, T1-weighted, gradient-echo&#xD;
      sequence used for study analysis). Immediately following the MP Rage, the subject will have&#xD;
      the second 10-minute RSN scan (10-minutes post drug) with the same RSN instructions. After&#xD;
      the second RSN scan is completed the subjects will complete the second Fullness Questionnaire&#xD;
      (FQ). This will be presented on the screen via goggles and the answers will be given to the&#xD;
      scanner operator via intercom. The subject will then be partially moved out of the scanner&#xD;
      for a 1 teaspoon (5cc) blood draw. This serum sample will be for glucose, insulin and&#xD;
      exenatide pharmacokinetic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will then be moved back into the scanner for the third and final 10-minute RSN&#xD;
      with the same previous instructions. Immediately following this scan the subject will&#xD;
      complete the third FQ and have 1 teaspoon (5cc) of blood drawn for glucose, insulin and&#xD;
      Exenatide pharmacokinetic levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After scanning, subjects will be taken to the CTSI and provided a full balanced standard meal&#xD;
      of 1200 calories. All subjects will have 2 lunch meal choices to choose from (chicken or ham)&#xD;
      and will be instructed to &quot;eat until you are full&quot;. After the meal, the subject will complete&#xD;
      the fourth FQ and a final 5cc blood draw for glucose, insulin and Exenatide PK level.&#xD;
      Approximate blood sampling for the whole day will be 1-2 ounces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All scanning will be done in the morning, between ~9am-12pm, to account for hormonal&#xD;
      fluctuation and for fasting comfort of the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3 MRI scanning Visit 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3 is identical to Visit 2 except the subject will receive the opposite injection. If&#xD;
      the subject was randomized to receive 10ug of Exenatide during Visit 2 then she will receive&#xD;
      .5cc of saline (placebo) during Visit 3. Otherwise study procedures will be identical.&#xD;
