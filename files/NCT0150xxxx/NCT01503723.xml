      Metabolomics, or metabonomics, is a large-scale approach to monitoring as many as possible of&#xD;
      the compounds involved in cellular processes in a single assay to derive metabolic profiles.&#xD;
      Metabolomics allows for a global assessment of a cellular state within the context of the&#xD;
      immediate environment, taking into account genetic regulation, altered kinetic activity of&#xD;
      enzymes, and changes in metabolic reactions. Metabolomics may be useful for understanding&#xD;
      metabolic imbalances and for diagnosis of human disease. The investigators plan to collect&#xD;
      exhaled breath condensate from patients with acute lung injury. Metabolomic analysis in the&#xD;
      patients may help us to explore some novel biomarkers for the disease diagnosis and outcome&#xD;
      prediction.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are the leading causes&#xD;
      of mortality and morbidity in the intensive care unit (ICU). The causes of ALI/ARDS differ&#xD;
      from patient to patient, including sepsis, aspiration, systemic inflammation, trauma, blood&#xD;
      transfusion, etc. With early detection and treatment, the survival rate may be improved&#xD;
      significantly. However, it is often difficult to differentiate ALI/ARDS from cardiogenic&#xD;
      pulmonary edema or other causes, even with advanced technology and invasive tools. A&#xD;
      potential tool is the breath chemical test, ranging from exhaled gas measurement, such as&#xD;
      exhaled nitric oxide or carbonic monoxide, to volatile organic compound determination and&#xD;
      nonvolatile biomarker profiling. Being completely noninvasive, sampling of the exhaled breath&#xD;
      condensates (EBC) allows clinicians and researchers to assess body functions in an easier and&#xD;
      flexible manner. Exhaled breath contains thousands of volatile and nonvolatile compounds in&#xD;
      trace amounts. Therefore, it is not until recently, after the development of highly sensitive&#xD;
      cutting-edge technologies in sample analysis, that the evaluation of this type of human&#xD;
      specimens becomes possible. Advanced technologies in proteomics, metabolomics, GC/LC-Mass&#xD;
      Spectrometry and pattern recognition computation generate a field of exhaled biomarker&#xD;
      profiling, called &quot;breathomics.&quot; After the establishment of the metabolomic profiling of EBC&#xD;
      in patients with ALI, ARDS or cardiogenic pulmonary edema, a useful and powerful noninvasive&#xD;
      tool for ALI/ARDS diagnosis and outcome prediction could be set up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolomics, or metabonomics, is a large-scale approach to monitoring as many as possible of&#xD;
      the compounds involved in cellular processes in a single assay to derive metabolic profiles.&#xD;
      Although metabolomics first referred to the monitoring of individual cells and metabonomics&#xD;
      referred to multicellular organisms, these terms are now often used interchangeably.&#xD;
      Metabolic changes occur through a number of mechanisms, including direct genetic regulation&#xD;
      and alterations in enzymatic and metabolic reactions. Metabolomics allows for a global&#xD;
      assessment of a cellular state within the context of the immediate environment, taking into&#xD;
      account genetic regulation, altered kinetic activity of enzymes, and changes in metabolic&#xD;
      reactions. Thus, compared with genomics or proteomics, metabolomics reflects changes in&#xD;
      phenotype and therefore function. Techniques applied to metabolic profiling include nuclear&#xD;
      magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectrometry (MS). Metabolomics have the advantage of being&#xD;
      capable of searching for proteins or metabolites in the blood or urine. Metabolomics may be&#xD;
      useful for understanding metabolic imbalances and for diagnosis of human disease. Over 30&#xD;
      endogenous metabolites have been studied in breast tissue, and breast cancer show elevated&#xD;
      total choline-containing compounds (tCho), low glycerophosphocholine, and low glucose&#xD;
      compared with benign tumors or healthy tissue. Similar to breast cancer, prostate cancer&#xD;
      exhibits a distinct metabolic profile characterized by high tCho and phosphocholine levels,&#xD;
      along with an increase in the glycolytic products lactate and alanine. In prostate cancer,&#xD;
      citrate may also be a marker of responsiveness to treatment. These results show the potential&#xD;
      utility of metabolomics in cancer diagnosis and clinical evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breath chemical tests have a broad spectrum of applications ranging from exhaled nitric oxide&#xD;
      fraction (FeNO) measurement to monitor the effect of anti-inflammatory treatment in asthma,&#xD;
      to volatile organic compound (VOC) determination and nonvolatile biomarker profiling in the&#xD;
      cooled breath sample called exhaled breath condensate (EBC). Being completely noninvasive,&#xD;
      sampling of the breath allows clinicians and researchers to assess different body functions&#xD;
      in a flexible manner. Therefore, breath testing is considered to be a potentially ideal&#xD;
      candidate for screening purposes. Besides widely known constituents such as nitrogen, oxygen,&#xD;
      carbon dioxide, inert gases and water vapour, exhaled breath also consists of thousands of&#xD;
      volatile and nonvolatile components, mainly in trace amounts, making detection a challenging&#xD;
      task. The use of innovative &quot;-omics&quot; technologies, including proteomics, metabolomics, mass&#xD;
      spectromics, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and ion mobility spectrometries,&#xD;
      offers great potential for the field of exhaled biomarker profiling. Unlike bronchoalveolar&#xD;
      lavage (BAL) and sputum induction which involves inhalation of hypertonic saline to induce&#xD;
      cough and possibly bronchoconstriction, EBC does not influence airway function or cause&#xD;
      inflammation. It can be easily and safely performed on patients with severe illness and even&#xD;
      allows for repeated measurements to be taken. As such, this is a relatively new field with&#xD;
      potential for more studies to be performed to investigate acute lung injury by metabolomics.&#xD;
