      The purpose of the study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate whether chitin can effect healthy adults, the nasal mucosa in a direction&#xD;
           that will enhance the immune response to infection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate whether chitin influence of the nasal mucosa is well tolerated, and that&#xD;
           there is no inflammation, as it seen with exposure to endotoxin.&#xD;

      STUDY SYNOPSIS Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
      •To assess the effects of intranasal dosing of chitin micro-particles on nasal mucosa&#xD;
      responses with respect to the concentration of cytokines (TNF-alfa, IFN-gamma, IL-1b, IL-4&#xD;
      IL5, IL, 6, IL-8, IL-10 and IL-13) in nasal lavage fluid compared to dosing with placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the effects of intranasal dosing of chitin micro-particles on nasal mucosa&#xD;
           responses with respect to the concentration of cytokines (TNF-alfa, IFN-gamma, IL-1b,&#xD;
           IL-4 IL5, IL, 6, IL-8, IL-10 and IL-13) in nasal lavage fluid compared to dosing with&#xD;
           active control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the total eosinophil counts and cysteinyl leukotriene concentration in nasal&#xD;
           lavage fluid at 4 and 8 hours post-dosing compared to pre-dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the total nasal symptom scores at 4 and 8 hours post-dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of chitin micro-particles dosed intranasally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a single-dose, doubled-blind placebo and single-blind active controlled&#xD;
      3-period cross-over study with a 2-week washout in between each treatment. The subjects will&#xD;
      be divided into 2-groups for the study and randomised to receive a single-dose of either&#xD;
      intranasal chitin micro-particles or placebo for the first two periods and a single dose of&#xD;
      an active control article, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), for the third period. The treatment for&#xD;
      the first two periods will be double-blinded and the treatment for the third period with LPS&#xD;
      will be single-blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each single dose application for chitin micro-particles (cmp), placebo and the active control&#xD;
      article, LPS, is to comprise two 0.1 ml metered sprays into each nostril. The total spray&#xD;
      volume for each application is 0.4 ml equivalent to a total single-dose for chitin of 2 mg&#xD;
      (0.5 mg per 0.1 ml spray), and a total single-dose for LPS, of 2 mg of endotoxin from&#xD;
      Enterobacter agglomerans (0.5 mg per 0.1 ml spray).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The climate chamber where the dosing is to be performed will run at 22°C with 3.5-4 air&#xD;
      changes per hour with clean HEPA-filtered air at a relative humidity (RH) of 35-40%&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will involve 12-healthy subjects conforming to the inclusion criteria randomised to&#xD;
      the treatments. The duration of each subject's participation will be c.42-days with eight&#xD;
      visits including screening and safety follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment plan and methods The study is to comprise three cross-over treatment periods, where&#xD;
      each subject (12 in total) will receive single-doses of cmp, placebo or LPS (active control)&#xD;
      in each of the three treatment periods. The study has been designed such that LPS is to be&#xD;
      dosed in the last period so as to mitigate any potential issues with carry-over.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening is to take place in a period of c.2-6-weeks prior to dosing. After obtaining&#xD;
      informed consent, each subject will undergo a screening visit in order to review the&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria and confirm eligibility. Each subject will then be assigned to&#xD;
      one of two dosing groups (6 subjects per group) for each of the three study periods in order&#xD;
      to co-ordinate dosing at the Clinic. The initial screening will identify 4-8 additional&#xD;
      subjects (total up to 20 screened) who will be included only if one of the originally&#xD;
      randomized subjects drop out of the study. Subjects that are replaced will be randomized for&#xD;
      treatment and will be required to undergo all three treatment periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For period 1, on day 0, the first dosing group will be randomized to receive either cmp or&#xD;
      placebo. Subjects will be admitted to the Clinic at 8:30h to acclimatize, receive pre-dosing&#xD;
      clinical assessment and confirm eligibility. Dosing is to start at 10:00h with assessment&#xD;
      conducted in accordance with the procedures defined below. Subjects will remain in the Clinic&#xD;
      until c. 20:00h. On the following day (day 1), the same subjects will receive a telephone&#xD;
      interview safety follow-up. On day 2, the second dosing group will be randomized to receive&#xD;
      either cmp or placebo, again receiving a telephone interview safety follow-up on following&#xD;
      day (day 3). For period 2, on day 14, the first dosing group will receive the dose not&#xD;
      previously assigned, either cmp or placebo and will receive a telephone interview safety&#xD;
      follow-up the following day (day 15). On day 16, the second dosing group will also receive&#xD;
      the dose not previously assigned, either cmp or placebo and again will receive a telephone&#xD;
      interview safety follow-up the following day (day 17). For period 3, LPS will be dosed to the&#xD;
      first dosing group on day 28 and to the second dosing group on day 30; with a telephone&#xD;
      interview safety follow-up on days 29 and 31 respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the last dosing visit, subjects will receive an end-of-study safety assessment by&#xD;
      telephone interview on day 42 (+/- 2 days), which will include adverse events checks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will be required to provide 10 ml of blood for haematological assessment at&#xD;
      screening and at treatment periods 1, 2 and 3. A total of 40 ml of blood will be drawn for&#xD;
      each subject for the entire duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-dosing&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Safety assessment in terms of physical examination, including mouth, nose and lungs&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Symptom questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Blood drawn for haematological tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Nasal lavage by the nasal olive test with the persons sitting with their head bent&#xD;
           forward for 60 seconds performed&#xD;
&#xD;
           Post-dosing&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Measurement of nasal symptom scores at 4 and 8-hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Acoustic rhinometry test performed at 4 and 8-hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Nasal lavage by the nasal olive test with the persons sitting with their head bent&#xD;
           forward for 60 seconds performed at 4 and 8-hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Symptom questionnaire performed at 4 and 8-hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Safety monitoring: vital signs, heart rate, blood pressure performed at 2, 6-hours&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Follow-up safety interview performed 24-hours after dosing (following day) which&#xD;
           includes adverse events recording and concomitant medication check.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary End-point Changes in levels (maximum concentration) of TNF-alfa, IFN-gamma, IL-1b,&#xD;
      IL-4, IL5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and IL-13 in nasal lavage samples following intranasal dosing&#xD;
      with cmp compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary End-point Changes in levels (maximum concentration) of TNF-alfa, IFN-gamma, IL-1b,&#xD;
      IL-4, IL5, IL-6, IL-8 IL-10 and IL-13 in nasal lavage samples following intranasal dosing&#xD;
      with cmp compared to lipopolysaccharide active control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Change from baseline:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the total eosinophil counts and cysteinyl leukotriene concentration in nasal lavage&#xD;
           fluid following intranasal dosing with cmp&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. total nasal symptom scores at 4 and 8-hours following intranasal dosing with cmp&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be assessed using the adverse events, vital signs and nasal acoustic rhinometry&#xD;
      following dosing with cmp versus placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Assessment For the cytokines and cell counts the concentrations are measured, and&#xD;
      the log-transformed data analyzed with an ANOVA model including study day and exposure as&#xD;
      fixed factor and participants as a random factor. These variables are described by the&#xD;
      geometric mean, coefficient of variance (CV), relative difference between exposures including&#xD;
      95% confidence interval (CI), and p-value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of ceiling and flooring problems in the data, heterogeneity in the (within&#xD;
      participant) variation, or violations of the assumption of normally distributed data, it is&#xD;
      not appropriate to analyze all the data of the outcomes like the symptom scores (change from&#xD;
      baseline) with ANOVAs. Here non-parametric tests will be applied. A Wilcoxon Rank sum test&#xD;
      will be used to compare the groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjective symptoms at baseline are described by the median and the inter quartile range. The&#xD;
      data for 'change in nasal scores' are described by box-plots. The upper adjacent value in the&#xD;
      plots is the largest data-point smaller than 75th percentile plus 3/2 times the inter&#xD;
      quartile range. The lower adjacent value is defined in the similar way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare placebo and the cmp exposure and taking into account a possible 'learning effect'&#xD;
      the data will be analysed by a standard technique taking into account the design&#xD;
      (cross-over). The participants will be divided into two groups due to the two possible&#xD;
      exposure orders; one group consisting of participants having been exposed to placebo exposure&#xD;
      before the cmp exposure; and another group of participants having been exposed to cmp before&#xD;
      the placebo exposure. The hypothesis of no difference between cmp and placebo exposure will&#xD;
      be tested by comparing the two groups with respect to the differences between the first and&#xD;
      the second measurement. A Wilcoxon Rank sum test is used to compare the two groups. In a&#xD;
      similar way we will test the hypothesis of 'no effect of learning'.&#xD;
