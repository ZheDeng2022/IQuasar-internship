      The purpose of this study is to explore the relationship between attempted and/or completed&#xD;
      suicide and reported experience of chronic pain among an adult veteran population. Specific&#xD;
      aims include a) examining the experience of chronic pain between patients who have either&#xD;
      attempted and/or completed suicide, non-suicide attempt mental health patients, and&#xD;
      non-mental health chronic pain patients and b) determining possible differences in reported&#xD;
      experiences of chronic pain based on mental and physical diagnoses, age, gender, ethnicity,&#xD;
      occupation, and patient's recorded perceptions of depression and/or quality of life. As&#xD;
      articulated in the Amendment approved on June 13, 2008, additional areas of interest include&#xD;
      histories of neurological disease (e.g. traumatic brain injury) and/or mental health&#xD;
      diagnoses. History of both neurologic disease and mental health diagnoses will also be&#xD;
      identified by chart review (per approval obtained June 13, 2008). As such this study will&#xD;
      also compare differences (e.g., mental health, neurological disease) between veterans who&#xD;
      have history of a suicide attempt, completion, or a lifetime history of suicidality and&#xD;
      matched control veterans without a history of suicide attempts, completions, or lifetime&#xD;
      history of suicide. The relationship between suicidal behavior, attempted/completed suicide,&#xD;
      and reported Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms among an adult veteran population&#xD;
      is also of interest. Additionally, this data set will be used to complete a validation study&#xD;
      regarding the Self-Directed Violence Classification System (SDVCS). Specifically, relevant&#xD;
      information in subject chart notes regarding self-directed violence (SDV) will be used to&#xD;
      categorize thoughts and behaviors according to the SDVCS.&#xD;
