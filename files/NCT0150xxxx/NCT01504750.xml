      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many study reports described benefits of natural sunlight. It is believed that artificial&#xD;
      light can achieve similar benefits as sunlight and can be used to compensate for the lack of&#xD;
      sunlight, for instance in north-facing hospital rooms or during wintertime.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most plausible paths mediating the effects of light are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the biological effect of light, relating to circadian biology and the sleep/wake-rhythm;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the emotional/psychological effects of light, relating to mood/stress and the&#xD;
           antidepressant action of light .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project aims to measure, evaluate and quantify the beneficial effects of a dynamic&#xD;
      daylight &amp; atmosphere experience in patient rooms for cardiovascular patients during the dark&#xD;
      months of the year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study involves an experiment in which psychological, emotional and clinical parameters of&#xD;
      patients in hospital rooms with standard light situation are compared with those of patients&#xD;
      in rooms with a dynamic daylight &amp; atmosphere experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population includes cardiovascular patients who reside in the general cardiology&#xD;
      department of the Maastricht University Hospital (18 patient beds) with an intended minimum&#xD;
      length of stay of 3 days, who have given written consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Half of the patient rooms on the ward are equipped with special luminaires. In the ceiling,&#xD;
      luminaires are installed that offer the basic lighting in the patient room that will&#xD;
      automatically and gradually change in light level (100-300 lux) and color temperature&#xD;
      (3000-4000 K). This so called daily rhythm light meets the EN12464-1 standard for patient&#xD;
      rooms in hospitals. The same luminaires in the ceiling will also offer the light boost by&#xD;
      bringing the illuminance to a level of maximal 2000 lux and 7000 K, during a period of two&#xD;
      hours in the morning. Besides the ceiling luminaires, a low intensity color cove as well as&#xD;
      some white LED spots are added to create a pleasant ambience in the patient room&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study measures are length of stay and quality of recovery expressed by&#xD;
      physiological, emotional and clinical parameters. Also the effect on patient satisfaction is&#xD;
      determined using pre and post assessments.&#xD;

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regular measurements for patient care will be mainly used as outcome measures. Some of the&#xD;
      psychological parameters are measured in regular care (e.g. pain score). Other psychological&#xD;
      parameters will be measured with an additional questionnaire (depression, appetite, delirium,&#xD;
      sleep quality and sleepiness). A trained research nurse will visit all participating patients&#xD;
      in their rooms to assist with completing the questionnaires. This way of data collection will&#xD;
      pose a minimal burden on the patients (maximum 30 minutes on daily basis). The risks of the&#xD;
      intervention are negligible, because the light level will not exceed outside luminance on a&#xD;
      cloudy day and meets all CIE safety standards (ref. CIE S009).&#xD;

This so called daily rhythm light meets the EN12464-1 standard for patient rooms in hospitals. The system offers a light boost by bringing the illuminance to a level of maximal 2000 lux and 7000 K, during a period of two hours in the morning. Besides, a low intensity color cove as well as some white LED spots are added to create a pleasant ambience in the patient room. The illuminance is between 50 and 60 lux and, depending on the color choice, the color temperature is 2300 K (relax) or 3800 K (active). The lighting solution used is HealWell of Philips Lighting.</description>
