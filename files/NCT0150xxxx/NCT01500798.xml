      This is a 24-week multi-center, double-blind, randomized, exploratory study of bardoxolone&#xD;
      methyl treatment in 18 patients with Stage 3 CKD (eGFR greater than or equal to 30.0 to less&#xD;
      than 60.0 ml/min/1.73m2) and diabetes to ensure at least 15 patients complete the study for&#xD;
      evaluation of the primary endpoints.&#xD;

             Screening Visit A and during screening (i.e., no change in dosage or medication).&#xD;
             Patients not taking an ACE inhibitor and/or ARB, or taking an ACE inhibitor and/or ARB&#xD;
             at levels below the goal dose set by K/DOQI guidelines (See Appendix 3) should have a&#xD;
             documented medical contraindication (e.g., hyperkalemia, dry cough, angioedema), which&#xD;
             the investigator must discuss with the appropriate medical monitor;&#xD;

             diastolic blood pressure (DBP) must be &lt; 90 mmHg during screening; both mean SBP and&#xD;
             mean DBP (determined as the average of three readings) must be within the described&#xD;
             range;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to practice methods of birth control (both males who have partners of&#xD;
             childbearing potential and females of childbearing potential, [see Section 9.7])&#xD;
             during screening, while taking study drug and for at least 30 days after the last dose&#xD;
             of study drug is ingested;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and able to cooperate with all aspects of the protocol;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and able to give written informed consent for study participation and provide&#xD;

             diabetic kidney disease is acceptable];&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ongoing clinical investigation with evidence (e.g., unexplained hematuria or red blood&#xD;
             cell or white blood cell casts) suggesting non-diabetic renal disease other than&#xD;
             nephrosclerosis;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of a renal donation, transplant or a planned transplant from a living donor&#xD;
