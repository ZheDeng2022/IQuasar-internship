  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study involves conducting formative research to develop a culturally appropriate&#xD;
      secondary prevention intervention for HIV-positive Black young men who have sex with men&#xD;
      (B-YMSM). The intervention draws upon the principles of Critical Consciousness Theory (CCT).&#xD;
      The formative research includes reviewing data and findings from relevant ATN protocols&#xD;
      (i.e., 070, 068, and 073) and existing health promotion interventions targeting young men of&#xD;
      color (i.e., the Young Warriors program, Hermanos de Luna y Sol [HLS]) and conducting focus&#xD;
      groups with up to 32 HIV- positive B-YMSM.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Focus groups will be conducted at two Adolescent Medicine Trials Unit (AMTU) sites and will&#xD;
      guide the selection of the intervention content areas and the development of the intervention&#xD;
      manual. The intervention aims to increase participation in health promoting behaviors and&#xD;
      improve self-worth and self-concept among HIV-positive B-YMSM. Specifically, the intervention&#xD;
      aims to address the following health promoting behaviors: 1) increasing engagement in HIV&#xD;
      treatment; 2) improving medication adherence; 3) reducing sexual risk behaviors; 4) reducing&#xD;
      substance use behaviors; and 5) increasing HIV status disclosure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on reviews of ATN 070 data and existing related interventions (ATN 068, ATN 073, Young&#xD;
      Warriors, HLS), draft components of the intervention curriculum for B-YMSM will be developed.&#xD;
      Four focus groups will then be convened (two per AMTU) with HIV-positive B-YMSM to a) obtain&#xD;
      input on the draft intervention curriculum, b) refine intervention components, and c) examine&#xD;
      psychosocial factors that may mediate or moderate the intervention effect. The focus groups&#xD;
      will be implemented using a &quot;Rapid Approach&quot; which allows for a focus on key areas of inquiry&#xD;
      by asking fewer questions and focusing on targeted responses of focus group participants. All&#xD;
      focus groups will be digitally recorded and transcribed. The transcripts will be reviewed and&#xD;
      data analyzed using a phenomenological approach; protocol team members and members of two&#xD;
      Youth Advisory Boards (YABs), which will include youth who are existing members of ATN site&#xD;
      CABs as well as youth recruited from other local agencies and organizations), will work on&#xD;
      the analysis of the data.&#xD;
