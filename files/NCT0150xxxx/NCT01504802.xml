  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is now widespread practice to treat children with short stature with growth hormone.&#xD;
      However, how an individual child will respond to growth hormone treatment is unpredictable&#xD;
      and highly variable. Some children will not respond to growth hormone treatment at all.&#xD;
      Currently, the only way to determine how well growth hormone therapy is working is to wait&#xD;
      until they have been treated for six months and to compare the pre-treatment growth velocity&#xD;
      with the growth velocity on treatment. It would be helpful to have a blood test that could be&#xD;
      done shortly after starting growth hormone that could predict whether how well a child is&#xD;
      responding to treatment. Such a blood test would allow endocrinologists to adjust the growth&#xD;
      hormone dose (or possibly stop it altogether, if it is not working) long before the six&#xD;
      months it currently takes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) and its partner amino-terminal propeptide of CNP (NTproCNP)&#xD;
      are proteins that play a critical role in regulating growth. The investigators have&#xD;
      previously shown that blood levels of these proteins increase in children being treated with&#xD;
      growth hormone. The investigators believe that a blood test for these proteins will be useful&#xD;
      in predicting a child's response to growth hormone treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine when after starting growth hormone, the blood&#xD;
      levels of CNP and NTproCNP start to increase.&#xD;

      Treatment of children with short stature with recombinant human growth hormone is widespread&#xD;
      practice. However, the growth response to growth hormone treatment is highly variable,&#xD;
      particularly for those children who do not have classic growth hormone deficiency. The&#xD;
      availability of a biomarker of efficacy that can be measured early in treatment would be&#xD;
      beneficial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) plays a critical role in linear growth. CNP is produced in&#xD;
      the growth plate and signals through a paracrine mechanism. Its bioinactive amino-terminal&#xD;
      propeptide (NTproCNP) is easily measurable in plasma and levels reflect rate of CNP&#xD;
      biosynthesis. Previous studies in lambs and children have shown that the plasma concentration&#xD;
      of NTproCNP correlates with linear growth velocity and the investigators have also shown that&#xD;
      levels are increased during growth hormone therapy. The investigators have proposed that&#xD;
      NTproCNP is a biomarker for linear growth and consider it the first &quot;growth plate function&#xD;
      test.&quot; Such a growth biomarker is likely to reflect efficacy of growth hormone therapy soon&#xD;
      after starting growth hormone, possibly as soon as a few days. Before the clinical utility of&#xD;
      this can be determined, the investigators need to ascertain the pharmacodynamics of CNP and&#xD;
      NTproCNP in response to growth hormone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to describe the pharmacodynamics of the CNP response to the&#xD;
      initiation of growth hormone in two sets of children with short stature, those with growth&#xD;
      hormone deficiency and those in whom normal growth hormone secretion (idiopathic short&#xD;
      stature) and to compare these data to the pharmacodynamics of other peptides previously&#xD;
      identified as potential biomarkers. The investigators hypothesize that plasma NTproCNP levels&#xD;
      will increase within four days of starting growth hormone therapy and that the response in&#xD;
      children with growth hormone deficiency will be more prompt and greater than those with&#xD;
      idiopathic short stature. The investigators second hypothesis is that the increase in&#xD;
      NTproCNP in response to growth hormone will correlate with the increase in growth velocity&#xD;
      after six and twelve months of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a prospective observational study of children with growth hormone deficiency&#xD;
      (n=10) and with idiopathic short stature (n=10) being started on rhGH therapy. The study&#xD;
      consists of frequent monitoring of analyte levels over one year of treatment.&#xD;
