  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many patients with celiac disease complain of neurocognitive symptoms such as mental&#xD;
      confusion, grogginess, difficulty with concentration and forgetfulness after exposure to&#xD;
      gluten. However, there is little data on any possible association between impaired cognitive&#xD;
      function and gluten intake in celiac disease. The investigators predict that patients with&#xD;
      celiac disease, when exposed to gluten, will experience neurocognitive symptoms such as&#xD;
      confusion, forgetfulness and difficulty concentrating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goals of this study are to determine the prevalence of neurocognitive symptoms after&#xD;
      exposure to gluten in patients with celiac disease and to characterize the nature of these&#xD;
      symptoms both in terms of their duration and severity.&#xD;

          2. 18-50 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Celiac Disease Group: Positive small intestinal biopsies meeting Marsh II or III&#xD;
             histologic criteria for celiac disease at least six months since the time of study&#xD;
             entrance as well as positive IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody or positive&#xD;
             IgA/IgG anti-Deamidated Gliadin Peptide (DGP) with normal serum IgA&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitive Group: Negative small intestinal biopsies and negative IgA&#xD;
             anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG) or negative IgA/IgG anti-Deamidated Gliadin Peptide&#xD;
             (DGP) with normal serum IgA, but with symptomatic response to gluten withdrawal&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject should have well controlled celiac disease and have been on a gluten-free diet&#xD;
             for at least six months prior to study enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subject must provide informed consent, as approved by the Institutional Review Board,&#xD;
             and agree to complete required study visits, blood work neuropsychological testing and&#xD;
             a urine pregnancy test (if applicable).&#xD;

             enteritis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject should not have daily symptoms concerning for brain fog such as mental&#xD;
             confusion or difficulty concentrating, at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject has symptomatic neurological or psychiatric disease(s) that would interfere&#xD;
             with the conduct of the study.&#xD;
