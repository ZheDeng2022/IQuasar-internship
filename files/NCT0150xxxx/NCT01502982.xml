    <textblock>
      The purpose is to test whether dose densified chemoimmunotherapy followed by central nervous&#xD;
      system (CNS) prophylaxis for young high risk diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients&#xD;
      is feasible and could improve time to treatment failure and reduce the risk of CNS relapses.&#xD;
      Six courses of rituximab-cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-etoposide-vincristine-prednison&#xD;
      (R-CHOEP) given in two weeks intervals with the support of G-CSF is followed by one course of&#xD;
      high dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) and high dose cytarabine (HD-Ara-C). The results will be&#xD;
      compared to a historical Nordic study.&#xD;

      Pathology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may be included on the bases of the histological diagnosis of the local pathologist.&#xD;
      The specimen will be reviewed by a central pathologist in each country&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients receive CHOEP-14 with rituximab x 6 with the support of G-CSF followed by high&#xD;
      dose cytarabine i.v. and high dose methotrexate i.v.Intrathecal (i.t.) CNS prophylaxis in&#xD;
      combination with chemotherapy is not to be given, but i.t. methotrexate may be given once&#xD;
      after initial liquid sampling. Radiotherapy will be given at the discretion of the individual&#xD;
      centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigations before, during and after treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The disease status will be assessed prior to treatment start, after 3 cycles of CHOEP +&#xD;
      rituximab and after completion of the treatment schedule. Positron Emission Tomography (PET)&#xD;
      using F18 deoxyglucose may be performed after fulfillment of treatment. Persistent, suspected&#xD;
      lymphoma tissue should whenever possible be confirmed with a biopsy, otherwise the patient&#xD;
      will be regarded as PR and second line therapy will be considered (see schematic outline).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical and radiological (CT) assessment are performed at pretreatment and subsequently on&#xD;
      sites initially involved, and bone marrow biopsy if initially involved&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the 3rd course&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the last course (within one month) of chemotherapy (biopsy if indicated)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After radiotherapy (for patient given radiotherapy as part of the primary treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  4x per year during the first and second year of follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2x per year during the third, fourth and fifth year of follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiological investigations at follow up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -CT after 6, 12 and 24 months of sites initially involved. CT abdomen in all cases after 12&#xD;
      and 24 months. X-ray of the thorax (if CT thorax is performed) after 6, 12 and 24 months&#xD;
