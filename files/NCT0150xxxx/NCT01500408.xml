  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Biogen Idec has developed a novel process to manufacture Interferon beta-1a (INFB), the&#xD;
      active ingredient of Avonex®, that does not include fetal bovine serum (FBS). This&#xD;
      bioequivalence study is being conducted to confirm the pharmacokinetic (PK) and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic (PD) comparability of Interferon beta-1a produced by the currently approved&#xD;
      serum-containing process and Interferon beta-1a produced by the new serum-free manufacturing&#xD;
      process.&#xD;
