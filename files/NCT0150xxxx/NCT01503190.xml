      This study plans to learn more about the immune system's response to breast cancer in young&#xD;
      women.&#xD;

      The investigators will be looking at the level of immune suppression in different types of&#xD;
      breast cancer. The investigators will use blood, urine, and tissue samples from patients with&#xD;
      Pregnancy Associated Breast Cancer (PABC) versus non-PABC, as well as comparing different&#xD;
      types of breast cancer. If tissue sampling permits, the investigators may use some of the&#xD;
      breast cancer tissue to develop models for human cancer for drug targeting. Understanding the&#xD;
      immune response and suppression in different types of cancer will help us understand&#xD;
      mechanisms involved in breast cancer better and help the investigators in developing new&#xD;
      treatment in the future.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Females &gt;18.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Histological or cytological confirmation of breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. For patients diagnosed with needle core or excisional biopsy, formalin-fixed paraffin&#xD;
             embedded tumor blocks or unstained slides should be available or planned to be&#xD;
             available after upcoming procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient should be willing to have fresh and/or fresh frozen tissue collected at time&#xD;
             of core biopsy, definitive breast cancer surgery or clinically planned breast cancer&#xD;
             metastasis biopsy/resection for research purposes as part of study procedures, if a&#xD;
             procedure is in the future planning of the patient's treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Any clinical stage allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Written informed consent obtained prior to any initiation of study procedures in the&#xD;
             case of subjects consented in clinic. Subjects consented outside of UCH, VVMC or SCC&#xD;
             will be consented by phone and verbal informed consent will be obtained prior to any&#xD;
             initiation of study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Women treated at UCH, VVMC or SCC may be pregnant. Other participants are excluded for&#xD;
             safety reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Women who have commenced or completed their breast cancer treatment may join this&#xD;
             study by consenting to a retrospective tissue donation only consent of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Women who receive their care at a facility other than UCH, VVMC or SCC may join this&#xD;
             study. These women will be consented utilizing the phone consent and will receive a&#xD;
             copy of the consent in the mail, or they will consent online and print a copy of their&#xD;
             online consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Known significant autoimmune condition [ie Lupus, Crohne's disease or Rhuematoid&#xD;
             Arthritis], chronic oral steroid use, use of systemic immunomodulatory prescription&#xD;
             drugs for any medical condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The presence of other comorbid conditions known to significantly impact immune&#xD;
             function, (such as: type I diabetes, uncontrolled adult onset diabetes, severe COPD,&#xD;
             uncontrolled infection or known HIV infection.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Underlying psychiatric condition which would, in the opinion of the investigator,&#xD;
             preclude compliance with study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects with a history of other malignancy besides current diagnosis of breast cancer&#xD;
             who were diagnosed and treated within the last 5 years are excluded, with exception of&#xD;
             cervical cancer definitively treated more than 2 years ago or non-melanomatous skin&#xD;
             cancer.&#xD;
