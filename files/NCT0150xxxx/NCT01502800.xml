      administered intravenously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of ARQ 761 To assess the preliminary anti-tumor&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, dose escalation study of (-)-trans-3-(5,6-dihydro-4H-pyrrolo&#xD;
      [3,2,1-ij] quinolin-1-yl)-4(1Hindol-3-yl) pyrrolidine-2,5-dione (ARQ) 761. Drug&#xD;
      administration regimen was designed in two parts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part I is a single-arm, non-randomized dose-escalation study. Part II is a multi-arm,&#xD;
      randomized dose-escalation study. It is designed to establish the clinical tolerability and&#xD;
      MTD of ARQ 761 and a recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D). This is the first-in-human study with&#xD;
      ARQ 761.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part I ARQ 761 will be administered intravenously at a starting dose of 195 mg/m2 IV once&#xD;
      weekly. A cycle for any patient already enrolled will consist of weekly administration of ARQ&#xD;
      761 with cycles repeated every 4 weeks (28 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part II Alternate dosing regimen of ARQ 761 will be evaluated at a starting dose of 390&#xD;
      mg/m2. ARQ 761 will be administered intravenously at the assigned duration (2 h or 3 h)&#xD;
      weekly, biweekly or for two consecutive weeks followed by one week of rest. Patient will be&#xD;
      randomized to Arm A, B or C after enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on toxicities observed, up to seven treatment cohorts will be enrolled with dose&#xD;
      escalation occurring by doubling (first escalation) and 40% increments thereafter. If dosing&#xD;
      is tolerated at all levels and pharmacokinetic data suggest continued escalation is&#xD;
      warranted, additional dose levels will be considered. Patients enrolled and assessed for dose&#xD;
      limiting toxicities (DLTs) will be eligible for intra-patient dose escalation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic assessments will be performed on the first and the forth infusion days&#xD;
      following the different regimen to maintain continuity among all treatment groups. Safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of ARQ 761 will be assessed for the duration of study treatment. Evaluation of&#xD;
      potential anti-tumor activity of ARQ 761 will be performed at regular intervals while&#xD;
      patients remain on study. Dose escalation of ARQ 761 will proceed until the maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose or recommended Phase 2 dose is reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-patient escalation from lower dose levels to successfully administered dose levels will&#xD;
      be allowed. In order for patients at lower dose levels to be eligible for dose escalation,&#xD;
      they must tolerate therapy without experiencing any DLT. In addition, prior to escalation, a&#xD;
      complete cohort of three patients must have completed two cycles of therapy at the higher&#xD;
      dose level without experiencing any DLTs. Patients receiving doses of ARQ 761 may be&#xD;
      escalated a maximum of two times to the next consecutive cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be enrolled according to a 3+3 dose escalation scheme. Treatment will be&#xD;
      staggered such that the first patient treated at each dose level will receive his or her&#xD;
      initial infusion at least 1 week prior to subsequent patients in the same cohort. At least 3&#xD;
      patients within a dose cohort must complete the first cycle of therapy prior to enrolling&#xD;
      subjects at the next dose level.&#xD;
