    <textblock>
      The WISH-trial is an open-label, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial. The effects of&#xD;
      self-measuring of the blood pressure at home and the use of a pro-active web-based feedback&#xD;
      system on the blood pressure, number of antihypertensive drugs used, and surrogate&#xD;
      cardiovascular markers during a 12 month period will be investigated.&#xD;

      Patients are assigned to the intervention or control group (1:1 ratio) by the research nurse&#xD;
      based on a computer-generated allocation sequence. Stratified randomization will be performed&#xD;
      to allocate equal numbers of patients with and without diabetes in both groups. This is an&#xD;
      open trial without masking of the participants or investigators. Outcome measures are not&#xD;
      blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients meeting the inclusion criteria will be asked to participate in the study. After&#xD;
      informed consent is given, all patients will be seen by the nurse practitioner and the doctor&#xD;
      (coordinator of the study) for an intake. During this intake patients will be informed about&#xD;
      the study, medical history will be taken, questionnaires are completed a physical examination&#xD;
      is performed and BP measurements and laboratory tests are performed. The patients will also&#xD;
      receive information about hypertension and personal lifestyle advises during the intake.&#xD;
      After inclusion, patients are randomized into two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Control group: After the intake the patients will receive usual care at the outpatient&#xD;
           clinic. After one year the coordinator of the study and the nurse practitioner will see&#xD;
           the control group patients for a final evaluation. During this evaluation, the&#xD;
           questionnaires, measurements and laboratory tests are repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Intervention group: After the intake, patients receive a HBP-monitor and a login account&#xD;
           to a personal website. Furthermore, instructions about the use of the home blood&#xD;
           pressure monitor and the website will be given. The web-based program can be used by the&#xD;
           patient to upload the blood pressure readings and to communicate with the nurse&#xD;
           practitioner or to the doctor and vice versa. Patients can ask questions daily and will&#xD;
           receive personal lifestyle advices on monthly basis. If needed, medication adjustments&#xD;
           will be made based on the blood pressure measurements. Online information will be&#xD;
           provided to the patients as a reference work with information about hypertension,&#xD;
           treatment strategies and technical facts of the blood pressure monitor and the website.&#xD;
           Patients in the intervention group will visit their own physician in the OPD after 6&#xD;
           months, instead of every 3 months. If necessary patients can visit their physician&#xD;
           earlier. If patients have multiple diseases, regular visits to the internal medicine&#xD;
           department are not restricted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 12 months, patients in the intervention and control groups are seen for the final&#xD;
      evaluation.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Measurement procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure measurement will be performed at the start&#xD;
      of the study and after 12 months. After the start of the study, the intervention group will&#xD;
      measure their own blood pressure with the use of the &quot;Microlife WatchBP&quot; Home blood pressure&#xD;
      monitor with an inflatable cuff for the upper arm. This meter is approved by the Dutch Heart&#xD;
      Foundation [18]. The measurements are automatically transferred to a secured website&#xD;
      (https://www.bpathome.com/main/ageneral.html) when the meter is connected with a computer&#xD;
      using an USB-portal. This website can be approached by the caregivers and the patients.&#xD;
      Patients are instructed to measure according to the European Society of Hypertension (ESH)&#xD;
      guidelines for blood pressure monitoring at home. During HBP measurement the following&#xD;
      recommendations are made:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The arm must be supported (on a table)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The arm is positioned at heart level&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All measurements are performed on the same arm (arm with highest blood pressure during&#xD;
           intake)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During intake the size of the inflatable bladder is determined (length of inflatable&#xD;
           bladder should cover 80-100% of the arm circumference, the width is half that length)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The centre of the bladder is placed over the brachial artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group will measure their BP according to the guideline for blood pressure&#xD;
      monitoring at home:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - HBP is monitored for 7 days at a stretch every month with two morning and two evening&#xD;
      measurements. The average of all values will be used for clinical decision making, with the&#xD;
      exception of the first day, which will be discarded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic and therapeutic thresholds:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cut-off limits for conventional blood pressure measures are not applicable for HBPM,&#xD;
      therefore different cut-off limits are used. Hypertension will be diagnosed by HBPM starting&#xD;
      at BP levels of 135/85 mmHg for patients without diabetes and 130/75 mmHg for patients with&#xD;
      Diabetes. The target HBP for therapy is below these thresholds. For OBP, hypertension will be&#xD;
      diagnosed at BP levels of 140/90 mmHg for patients without diabetes and 130/80 mmHg for&#xD;
      patients with diabetes, the target OBP is below this threshold.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety limits are set on readings greater than 200/100 mmHg or systolic BP less than 80 mmHg,&#xD;
      which will trigger an alert in the system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacological therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients enrolled in the study will continue their current blood pressure medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The medication and dose adjustments in patients randomized to the intervention group will be&#xD;
      done monthly by the nurse practitioner or the coordinating physician based on their HBP&#xD;
      measurements. Patients in the study group can communicate with the coordinating doctor by the&#xD;
      secured website. Medication adjustments are made by a physician and communicated by the&#xD;
      web-based system or telephone. Medication adjustments are made based on the European&#xD;
      guidelines. When necessary the doctor who coordinates the study can consult a senior&#xD;
      physician to discuss about the medication changes. These patients will see there own&#xD;
      physicians 6 months after the inclusion, provided these patients only have hypertension. If&#xD;
      patients have multiple diseases, regular visits are not restricted. The head of the&#xD;
      outpatients clinic will supervise the coordinating doctor during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to the non-intervention group will receive usual care and their own&#xD;
      specialist will make the necessary medication adjustments, during their visits to the&#xD;
      outpatient clinic or during hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lifestyle interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the intervention group will receive both general and personal lifestyle-advices&#xD;
      every month and when patients have questions about lifestyle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple aspects will be taken into account:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Smoking cessation: For counseling and help with smoking cessation, the guidelines of a&#xD;
           Dutch expert centre for tobacco control 'STIVORO' will be followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Moderation of alcohol consumption: Advice on alcohol consumption is based on the&#xD;
           national guidelines of acceptable alcohol consumption and binge drinking. Women are&#xD;
           advised not to drink more than one consumption a day and men are advised not to drink&#xD;
           more than 2 consumptions a day. Furthermore the risks associated with binge-drinking are&#xD;
           explained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regular physical activity: Patients are advised to put together at least 30 minutes of&#xD;
           moderate-intensity physical activity on at least five days a week, according to the&#xD;
           guideline of healthy physical activity in the primary care. Moderate to intense exercise&#xD;
           includes for example: walking, cycling, gardening, swimming and dancing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduction of high salt and fat intake: Patients are advised not to consume more than 6&#xD;
           grams of salt during the day. Furthermore the total daily intake of fat is aimed to be&#xD;
           less than 30% of total daily energy intake and the saturated fatty acids less than 10%&#xD;
           of total daily energy intake. Dietary interventions are based on the national guidelines&#xD;
           of healthy diet.&#xD;
