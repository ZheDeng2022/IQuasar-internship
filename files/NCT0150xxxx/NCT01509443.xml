      Overall goal: To apply the investigators' well defined simple, few-minute breathing/ mild&#xD;
      physical exercise program and evaluate its efficacy/benefits for the improvement of&#xD;
      clinico-immunological outcome in obese patients with asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale &amp; Hypothesis: Different breathing exercise regimens currently recommended are not&#xD;
      well defined and in certain cases may worsen dyspnea or even trigger an asthma attack.&#xD;
      Therefore, it is important to evaluate the overall usefulness of a breathing exercise as a&#xD;
      therapeutic intervention of asthma. In this regard, the investigators have designed an easy,&#xD;
      few-minute breathing exercise program as a treatment modality for asthma and to evaluate its&#xD;
      efficacy in improving associated clinico-immunological symptoms. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that the investigators' well-designed breathing/mild physical exercise&#xD;
      intervention for obese patients will help alleviate the stress and symptoms of asthma by&#xD;
      reducing the chronic low-grade systemic inflammation and thus potentiate the beneficial&#xD;
      outcome of medication to render a better control over the disease and to improve the quality&#xD;
      of life in obese patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical relevance/Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect that their exercise module will help reduce inflammation caused by&#xD;
      asthma, and thereby relieving symptoms of asthma. If successful, this would allow regular&#xD;
      individualized exercise module to be recommended as a part of therapy for people with asthma,&#xD;
      which could possibly reduce the dosage as well as frequency of taking medicine that they&#xD;
      need.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Asthmatics particularly obese have major constraints impeding regular physical activity and&#xD;
      exercise. Indeed, the few studies that have resorted to the option of exercise in asthmatic&#xD;
      patients also recognized the exacerbation of associated symptoms as a major limitation of&#xD;
      this approach. Considering the other obstacles that are often involved, such as lack of time&#xD;
      and motivation, inadequate social support and lack of access to facilities etc, it is&#xD;
      therefore all the more necessary to design a simple, feasible and carefully tailored&#xD;
      breathing exercise modality in obese patients with asthma, and to study its impact on the&#xD;
      improvement of clinico-immunological parameters, lung function and overall quality of life.&#xD;
      To this end, investigators have developed a safe and feasible light breathing exercise&#xD;
      program for individuals with asthma based on our previous observations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Aims &amp; Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' main goal is to apply a well defined simple exercise program that includes&#xD;
      physical and breathing exercise lessons and evaluate its effects on the improvement of&#xD;
      clinico-immunological outcome in obese patients with asthma. There are three main objectives&#xD;
      based on clinic-immunological outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the improvement of asthma control, lung function and airways hyper-reactivity&#xD;
           after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To test if the proposed intervention will result in the improvement of pro-inflammatory&#xD;
           profiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine if physical and psychological performances as well as health related&#xD;
           quality of life are positively impacted by the proposed exercise modality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 200 individuals with asthma will be enrolled in this study and divided into two groups:&#xD;
      The intervention group and controls. The intervention group will receive standard asthma care&#xD;
      along with breathing/mild physical exercise. The control group will be the asthmatic patients&#xD;
      who are not willing to receive the exercise intervention. At study entry, participants will&#xD;
      undergo a clinical assessment which includes physical exam, asthma control/ quality of life&#xD;
      questionnaires, pulmonary function tests, and lung inflammation test (Exhaled Nitric Oxide).&#xD;
      To monitor participants throughout the study, follow up visits will be done at 6, 12, 18 and&#xD;
      24 weeks after starting the exercise. About 40 ml blood will be collected at baseline&#xD;
      (pre-exercise) and two different time points (3 and 6 months of post-exercise). The blood&#xD;
      samples will be used for pro-inflammatory profiles. Duration of the study will be three&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
