      The Purpose of the study is to to evaluate the performance of the SOLO (version 2.0)&#xD;
      micropump insulin delivery system, in Type 1 diabetic patients who use insulin pumps for&#xD;
      their treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi center, one arm, open label and prospective study to assess the safety and&#xD;
      quality of the SOLO 2.0 MicroPump Insulin Delivery System, following changes that were done&#xD;
      to the SOLO previous version which was validated in 54 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SOLO 2.0 has the same intended use and core technology as previous SOLO with addition of&#xD;
      safety measures, GUI changes and design changes for manufacturability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include a 30 days treatment period with the Solo MicroPump with no special&#xD;
      care required for maintaining glycemic control and with an optional extension period of up to&#xD;
      three month in Israel and up to six month in Austria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes 3 scheduled treatment and one follow up phone call one week after&#xD;
      termination of the study. In case of participating the extension period, additional visits&#xD;
      will consist once a month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes 3 scheduled treatment visits and one scheduled telephone call&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 includes eligibility, baseline evaluation and training in handling of the SOLO&#xD;
      System. If no additional practice is required patients will be enrolled. Visit 2 will&#xD;
      commence and Solo pump will be filled with insulin. If additional practice is required&#xD;
      subject will be sent home for an additional training period of a few days practice using&#xD;
      saline and then return for visit 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment visits will take place at 3, 10 and 30 days after the enrolment. Additional visits&#xD;
      will take place at 60, 90, 120 and 150 days depending on the extension period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical assessment includes DTSQ information, Subject Diary, urine &amp; blood sampling, physical&#xD;
      examination, the SOLO Performance Questionnaire, R&amp;D Questionnaire and Complaint Report&#xD;
      Forms.Subjects will be asked to record blood glucose measurements, daily activities and&#xD;
      carbohydrate consumptions between visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seven days after termination of study treatment a telephone contact with the study subject&#xD;
      will take place for the purpose of adverse event reporting and the completion of DTSQ&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;
