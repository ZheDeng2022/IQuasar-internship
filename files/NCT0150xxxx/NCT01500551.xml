      previously participated in tofacitinib JIA studies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2/3, long term, open-label, follow-up study. Subjects will have previously&#xD;
      participated in qualifying/index JIA studies of tofacitinib. Those who have already completed&#xD;
      such participation and enroll outside the 14 day window following completion of the End of&#xD;
      Study (EOS) Visit of the qualifying/index study will participate in a screening Visit to&#xD;
      determine eligibility. A Baseline Visit will then occur within 28 days after the Screening&#xD;
      Visit. For subjects who are completing participation in a qualifying study of tofacitinib and&#xD;
      enrolling on the same day of the EOS Visit of the qualifying/index study, the EOS Visit of&#xD;
      the qualifying/index study can be combined with the Screening and Baseline Visits for this&#xD;
      study. The subjects who enroll within the 14 day window following completion of the EOS Visit&#xD;
      of the qualifying/index study will participate in a combined Screening and Baseline Visit for&#xD;
      this study. After the Baseline Visit, visits will occur at 1 month (1 month=30 days) and 3&#xD;
      months, then every 3 months thereafter as long as the subject remains in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 340 participants are projected to enroll into this open label extension study&#xD;
      after completing a qualifying/index study in the JIA program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For subjects who entered this study from the A3921103 and A3921104 qualifying/index studies,&#xD;
      their participation in this study ends after the first marketing approval of tofacitinib for&#xD;
      the treatment of polyarticular course Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (pJIA) in any country.&#xD;
      This study will end once the last subject, and all other subjects, who entered from index&#xD;
      study A3921165 have completed approximately 1 year in this study, or after the first&#xD;
      marketing approval of tofacitinib for the treatment of systemic JIA, whichever comes first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of an individual subject's participation may vary depending upon when they&#xD;
      enter the trial.&#xD;
