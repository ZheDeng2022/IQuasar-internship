    <textblock>
      Senior hip fracture patients are the most vulnerable to malnutrition and protein deficiency.&#xD;
      Low protein intake, like vitamin D deficiency, contribute to an increased risk for hip&#xD;
      fracture. Notably, several clinical trials with protein supplementation in senior hip&#xD;
      fracture patients resulted in fewer deaths, shorter hospital stay, and a higher likelihood of&#xD;
      return to independent living. The proposal is to test the effect of an oral nutritional&#xD;
      supplement (ONS) which has been designed to meet the specific nutrient needs of senior bone&#xD;
      and muscle health. The hypothesis is that this ONS will improve functional recovery after hip&#xD;
      fracture (as measured by Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB)), improve quality of life,&#xD;
      improve muscle mass, and- decrease falls and hospital re-admission after hip fracture.&#xD;
