      The primary purpose of the current study is to rigorously test the psychometric properties of&#xD;
      the INQ-12 and ACSS (Van Orden et al., 2008) in Veterans, something which has not been done&#xD;
      to date. Factor structure, internal consistency, convergent and discriminant validity will&#xD;
      all be assessed. Secondary goals are to determine if burdensomeness, failed belongingness,&#xD;
      and acquired capability are distinct versus overlapping constructs and whether or not values&#xD;
      mediate the relationship between reasons for living and suicide risk. Lastly, the inclusion&#xD;
      of the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation (BSS) allows us to analyze participants' responses to&#xD;
      explore whether or not participants can be grouped into those who want to die by suicide&#xD;
      because they want to escape their problems and those who want to die to influence other&#xD;
      people.&#xD;

      Suicide is a significant problem among Veterans of the U.S. Military. Katz (2007) reported&#xD;
      that there were 144 suicides among Veterans who served in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF)&#xD;
      and/or Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) from 2002-2005. There is no nationwide surveillance&#xD;
      system that tracks Veteran suicides. However, the National Violent Death Reporting System&#xD;
      (NVDRS) created in 2003 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) with the&#xD;
      purpose of gathering thorough information about suicides and other violent deaths allows&#xD;
      researchers to reasonably extrapolate national suicide rates for Veterans. A CDC report&#xD;
      (2006) based on NVDRS data estimated that approximately 6,500 veterans from all wars die by&#xD;
      suicide each year, accounting for approximately 20% of suicides per year nationwide. While&#xD;
      much is known about risk factors for suicide (e.g., Beck, Steer, Kovacs, &amp; Garrison, 1985;&#xD;
      Jobes &amp; Mann, 1999) such information has little clinical utility for predicting whether or&#xD;
      not an individual is likely to die by suicide in the near-term. One of the few attempts to&#xD;
      address this issue is the interpersonal-psychological theory of suicide (Joiner, 2005). The&#xD;
      interpersonal psychological theory proposes that people die by suicide for three reasons: (1)&#xD;
      they perceive themselves as a burden to others; (2) they experience a profound feeling of&#xD;
      disconnectedness from others, what Joiner (2005) calls ''thwarted belongingness'' (p. 118);&#xD;
      and (3) they have become habituated to the fear and physical pain inherent in a suicidal act&#xD;
      by repeatedly enduring painful and provocative situations, whether through such experiences&#xD;
      as repeated suicide attempts, other physically painful experiences, or frequent exposure to&#xD;
      danger. Importantly, all three factors must be present for a suicide to occur, according to&#xD;
      the interpersonal-psychological theory; together, these three characteristics are ''proximal,&#xD;
      causal, interactive risk factors'' (Van Orden, Witte, Gordon et al., 2008a, p. 72).&#xD;
      Components of the theory have been tested in adults (Joiner, Pettit, Walker, Voelz, Cruz, &amp;&#xD;
      Rudd, 2002; Joiner &amp; Rudd, 2000), college students, and adolescents (Joiner, Rudd, Rouleau, &amp;&#xD;
      Wagner, 2000). However, research has only begun to explore whether the theory applies to&#xD;
      Veterans (Cornette, Deboard, Clark, Holloway, Brenner, Gutierrez, et al., 2007; Cornette,&#xD;
      deRoon-Cassini, Joiner, &amp; Proescher, 2006). Brenner et al. (2008) conducted a qualitative&#xD;
      study of OEF/OIF Veterans which found relevance of the theory to their experiences. In&#xD;
      particular, themes emerged around combat as a context for exposure to painful stimuli,&#xD;
      perceptions of burdensomeness, and failed belongingness. This theory shows promise for&#xD;
      designing prevention and clinical intervention strategies for Veterans, but more data are&#xD;
      needed on which to base such work. To facilitate testing the interpersonal-psychological&#xD;
      theory of suicide, Joiner and colleagues have developed several instruments (Bender, Gordon,&#xD;
      &amp; Joiner, 2007; Bryan, Morrow, Anestis, &amp; Joiner, 2010; Van Orden,Witte, Gordon et al.,&#xD;
      2008a). The Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire (INQ) taps into the constructs of thwarted&#xD;
      belongingness and perceived burdensomeness. The Acquired Capability for Suicide Scale (ACSS;&#xD;
      Van Orden et al., 2008) measures fearlessness about suicide. The current study will focus on&#xD;
      the 12-item version of the INQ (INQ-12; Van Orden, Witte, Gordon, Bender, &amp; Joiner, 2008a)&#xD;
      recently validated by Freedenthal, Lamis, Osman, Kahlo, and Gutierrez (2011). This measure&#xD;
      contains seven items that assess perceived burdensomeness and five items that assess&#xD;
      belongingness. An example of a burdensomeness item in the INQ-12 is, ''These days, I think I&#xD;
      have failed the people in my life''. An example of a belongingness item is, ''These days,&#xD;
      other people care about me''. The ACSS is a 20-item measure rated on a scale of 1 (not at all&#xD;
      like me) to 5 (very much like me). Sample items include, &quot;I am not at all afraid to die&quot; and&#xD;
      &quot;I can tolerate a lot more pain than most people&quot;. Van Orden et al. report acceptable&#xD;
      convergent and discriminant validity. The authors also reported a strong negative correlation&#xD;
      with the fear of suicide subscale on the Reasons for Living Inventory (RFL; Linehan, Nielsen,&#xD;
      &amp; Chiles, 1983) and a positive correlation with the courage to kill oneself item on the Beck&#xD;
      Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSS; Beck &amp; Steer, 1991). Bender, Gordon, Bresin, and Joiner&#xD;
      (2011) reported acceptable internal consistency as well. However, formal psychometric studies&#xD;
      of the ACSS have yet to be conducted. Joiner (2005) describes burdensomeness, failed&#xD;
      belongingness and acquired capability as separate constructs, with the INQ-12 and ACSS&#xD;
      designed to assess each independently. However, for purposes of explaining whether a given&#xD;
      individual is likely to die by suicide, Joiner et al. (2009) explain that the first two&#xD;
      constructs together create the desire for death and that the third is necessary for a person&#xD;
      to engage in potentially lethal self-harm behavior. Therefore, a complex interaction between&#xD;
      the three is proposed. Support for this interaction was found by Joiner et al. in two&#xD;
      independent samples, one community sample of young adults and a second drawing on archival&#xD;
      data from active duty military personnel being treated for a recent significant&#xD;
      suicide-related event (e.g., serious ideation or attempt). A major limitation of this study&#xD;
      was that measures of the constructs differed, making it somewhat difficult to determine what&#xD;
      was being assessed in the two samples. Additionally, in their psychometric examination of the&#xD;
      INQ-12 Freedenthal and colleagues (2011) found evidence of an overarching factor uniting the&#xD;
      two subscales of burdensomeness and failed belongingness. Assessing for suicide risk is a key&#xD;
      element of the clinical management of high-risk individuals (Gutierrez et al., 2009), but is&#xD;
      only the first step. To adequately select appropriate interventions clinicians must know what&#xD;
      is driving an individual's suicidality (Jobes, 2006) and also what factors are keeping the&#xD;
      person from acting on their thoughts and urges. This information better helps the clinician&#xD;
      and client to develop strategies aimed at creating (or rediscovering) what makes life worth&#xD;
      living; focusing on plans, goals, and hope for the future (Jobes, Comtois, Brenner, &amp;&#xD;
      Gutierrez, 2011). Historically, the RFL (Linehan et al., 1983) has been one of the primary&#xD;
      measures of protective factors against suicide, and indeed has shown great utility. A&#xD;
      potentially related area of study is the role of one's values. The consciously chosen way in&#xD;
      which an individual lives her life, the driving force behind her actions, and the desired&#xD;
      outcomes of her behaviors define what an individual values (Luoma, Hayes, &amp; Walser, 2007).&#xD;
      Helping clients live lives consistent with their values provides purpose and meaning, gives&#xD;
      direction to their choices, and allows them to set reasonable, flexible goals likely to&#xD;
      motivate meaningful action (Luoma et al.). Accomplishing these things should greatly&#xD;
      facilitate reducing an individual's risk of suicide, since it answers the fundamental&#xD;
      existential question &quot;why is life worth living?&quot; Ciarrochi and Bailey (2008) created the&#xD;
      Survey of Life Principles to assess values, and provide preliminary support for its use in&#xD;
      their manual.&#xD;
