  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is evaluating a public health intervention strategy trial which aims to reduce the&#xD;
      incidence of HIV at a population-level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed strategy is a two steps process:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Extensive HIV counselling and testing, and comprehensive prevention programme among a&#xD;
           target population&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immediate ART initiation after HIV diagnosis, irrespective of CD4 count criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The underlaying trial hypothesis is that HIV testing followed by immediate ART initiation of&#xD;
      all HIV-infected individuals will prevent onward transmission and reduce HIV incidence in the&#xD;
      population. This is a cluster randomised controlled trial with a total of 22 communities used&#xD;
      as the units for randomisation. Enrolment of a population of 22 000 individuals among which 4&#xD;
      400 are expected to be HIV-Infected.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial objective is to estimate the effect of ART initiated immediately after HIV&#xD;
      diagnosis on the reduction in incidence of new HIV infections in the general population. It&#xD;
      will be conducted in two phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  First phase: aiming to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of extensive HIV&#xD;
           testing and early ARV treatment initiation on a subset of the target population (Hlabisa&#xD;
           sub-district in KwaZulu Natal, South Africa); completion on February 2014.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Second phase: full implementation of the trial in the target population from May 2014.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed intervention has two components :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Component 1 &quot;Test&quot;: HIV counselling and testing, and comprehensive prevention programme&#xD;
           among the entire target population&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Component 2 &quot;Treat&quot;: ART treatment initiation for HIV infected individuals following two&#xD;
           strategies&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  control group: ART initiation when eligible for treatment as per WHO guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  intervention group: immediate ART initiation regardless of immunological and&#xD;
                clinical staging&#xD;
