  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to clinically demonstrate a phenomenon of measurement error that&#xD;
      can occur during placement of a specific type of total knee replacement prosthesis (single&#xD;
      radius femoral component) using a certain type of surgical technique (flexion/extension gap&#xD;
      balancing).&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in varus/vagus laxity of the knee joint measured with the knee positioned at a 90 degree angle with posteriorly stabilized vs. cruciate retaining trails in place.</measure>
    <time_frame>At the time of the surgical procedure</time_frame>
    <description>During the surgical procedure each participant will undergo measurement of varus/valgus laxity (in degrees) at 90 degrees knee flexion using both types of trial implants in sequence. We will evaluate whether the difference of varus/valgus laxity between the two surgical conditions is correlated to change in anterior/posterior relative position of the tibia (relative to femur) measured between the two conditions. A positive correlation between these two variables (change of position to change of laxity) would demonstrate a potential for measurement error that could occur during surgical procedures if position change of the tibia is not accounted for. All outcomes for this study are measured during the surgical procedure.</description>

             investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of a single radius posterior-stabilized TKA prosthesis is planned&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Spinal anesthetic is planned&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of osteoarthritis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has normal knee ligaments with no history of previous injury or surgery to ligaments,&#xD;
             or other pathologic condition&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has at least 100 degrees knee flexion preoperatively (measured by long goniometer)&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient receives general anesthetic&#xD;
&#xD;

             post-traumatic arthritis)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of any prior knee ligament injury, or any surgery to ligaments&#xD;
&#xD;
