  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of AIM-102 for the treatment of allergen-induced asthma. Individuals with stable,&#xD;
      mild to moderate allergic asthma by American Thoracic Society (ATS) criteria (1), with a&#xD;
      history of episodic wheeze and shortness of breath, will be eligible for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will receive 4 consecutive days of dosing of AIM-102 or placebo (inactive&#xD;
      product) with an allergen challenge on day 3 of dosing to see how the patient's lung function&#xD;
      is changed by using AIM-102 or placebo.&#xD;

      This is a Phase II, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of AIM-102 for the treatment of allergen-induced asthma. Individuals with stable,&#xD;
      mild to moderate allergic asthma by American Thoracic Society (ATS) criteria (1), with a&#xD;
      history of episodic wheeze and shortness of breath, will be eligible for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is divided into 2 parts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who meet all entry criteria will be screened with a history, physical examination,&#xD;
      spirometry, and routine laboratory tests. If they continue to meet entry criteria, their&#xD;
      atopic status will be documented by skin testing against common airborne allergens (including&#xD;
      cat, dust mite, grass, pollen). Twenty-four (24) hr later, an allergen challenge will be&#xD;
      performed to confirm the presence of an Early Asthmatic Response (EAR) and Late Asthmatic&#xD;
      Response (LAR). Methacholine PC20 and sputum differentials will be performed before and after&#xD;
      allergen challenges. Only patients with a documented early and late asthmatic response to&#xD;
      inhaled incremental allergen challenge will be eligible for entry into Part 2 of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: Dosing and Follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assigned to receive drug and placebo in a random order, with at least a two&#xD;
      week washout between treatment periods. Spirometry, vital signs, and asthma symptomatology,&#xD;
      methacholine challenge, sputum differentials will be evaluated before the first dose and&#xD;
      again 24 hr before allergen challenge. Allergen challenge will be performed in the morning of&#xD;
      Day 3 of dosing, post-dose, with spirometry measured until seven hr post-challenge. Sputum&#xD;
      will also be induced at seven hr following the allergen challenge. Methacholine challenge and&#xD;
      sputum induction will be performed 24 hr after allergen challenges. Any adverse events (AEs)&#xD;
      and asthma symptoms will be evaluated at each clinic visit. A physical examination, vital&#xD;
      signs, ECG, spirometry and laboratory tests will be repeated at the termination visit.&#xD;
