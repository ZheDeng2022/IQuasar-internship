  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Herpes Zoster (shingles) is caused by reactivation of latent varicella zoster virus (VZV)&#xD;
      that usually occurs decades following initial exposure. The risk of developing shingles&#xD;
      increases with age. Shingles presents as a painful, itchy blistering rash that usually&#xD;
      involves a single portion of the skin and lasts about 7-10 days. The risk of developing&#xD;
      shingles increases with age in healthy people, and has been shown in some studies to be&#xD;
      increased in people with rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Zostavax, a live-attenuated vaccine against the varicella zoster virus, was first approved by&#xD;
      the FDA for the prevention of Shingles among people 60 years and older, and is now approved&#xD;
      for use in people aged 50 years and older. Because rheumatoid arthritis and some of the&#xD;
      medications used to treat rheumatoid arthritis can impair the body's immune system, it is not&#xD;
      known how much of an immune response can be generated in people with rheumatoid arthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goals of this study are to measure the immune response after standard vaccination with&#xD;
      Zostavax in people with rheumatoid arthritis in comparison to people with healthy immune&#xD;
      systems. All participants will be 50 years old or older, and subjects with rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis will not be eligible if they are taking certain biologic medications, including TNF&#xD;
      inhibitors (Etanercept or Adalimumab). Ten healthy subjects and 10 subjects with rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis will all receive a single vaccination with Zostavax, then will be followed for 12&#xD;
      weeks to assess the immune response and for the development of local rash or other potential&#xD;
      side effects.&#xD;
