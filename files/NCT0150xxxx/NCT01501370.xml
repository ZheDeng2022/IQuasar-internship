  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors represent a potential new class of antitumor agents.&#xD;
      Vorinostat (suberoylanilide Hydroxamic acid, SAHA) inhibits the activity of all 11 known&#xD;
      human class I and II HDACs. HDACs have many protein targets whose structure and function are&#xD;
      altered by acetylation, including histones and non-histones proteins component of&#xD;
      transcription factors controlling gene expression and proteins that regulate cell&#xD;
      proliferation, migration and death (1). Vorinostat has undergone initial evaluation in&#xD;
      several phase I and II clinical trials in both solid and hematologic malignancies. It has&#xD;
      shown activity in hematologic malignancies including Hodgkin's disease and non Hodgkin's&#xD;
      lymphomas (2-5); it has been approved for treatment of cutaneous manifestation in patients&#xD;
      with primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma who have progressive, persistent or recurrent disease&#xD;
      on or following two systemic therapies (6). HDAC function is critical for Multiple Myeloma&#xD;
      (MM) cells by actively maintaining a transcriptional program indispensable for their&#xD;
      uncontrolled proliferation and/or inappropriate resistance to pro-apoptotic stimuli. The&#xD;
      pleiotropic anti-MM effects of Vorinostat and its ability to sensitize MM cellsto multiple&#xD;
      conventional or novel agents (7) provide the framework for clinical trials of Vorinostat in&#xD;
      MM. A phase I trial of oral Vorinostat alone in advanced MM shows modest activity, but&#xD;
      treatment was generally well tolerated (common drug related adverse events (AEs) included&#xD;
      fatigue, anorexia, dehydration, diarrhea and nausea and were mostly grade &lt; 2) (8). A phase I&#xD;
      clinical trial of Vorinostat in association with Bortezomib in relapsed MM patients report a&#xD;
      partial response (PR) rate of 42%, with responses occurring also in patients refractory to a&#xD;
      previous Bortezomib based regimen. Treatment was generally well tolerated (main adverse&#xD;
      events were myelosuppression, fatigue and diarrhea) (9). Lenalidomide is an active agent&#xD;
      against MM, that as shown activity in both the relapse and newly diagnosed settings, in&#xD;
      combination with chemotherapy or steroids only. The dose of Lenalidomide commonly used in the&#xD;
      relapse setting, in association with steroids, is 25 mg/day on days 1-21 every 28 days (10,&#xD;
      11). A recent phase I study evaluated the safety and tolerability of Vorinostat in&#xD;
      combination with Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone in relapsed patients:no dose limiting&#xD;
      toxicities prohibited dose escalation, the maximum tolerated dose has not been reached and&#xD;
      the maximum administered dose was Lenalidomide 25 mg/day on days 1-21, Dexamethasone 40&#xD;
      mg/day on days 1,8,15,22, Vorinostat 400 mg/day on days 1-7 and 15-21; each cycle was&#xD;
      repeated every 28 days. Rate of at least PR was 51%, and activity was seen also in patients&#xD;
      who received prior Lenalidomide therapy (clinical benefit reported in 69% of patients,&#xD;
      including minimal response or better in 33% of Lenalidomide refractory patients). The most&#xD;
      common drug related grade &gt; 3 AEs were neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, anemia and&#xD;
      fatigue (12). Since Vorinostat has shown efficacy also in patients previously treated with&#xD;
      Lenalidomide, and in patients refractory to Lenalidomide, the investigators hypothesis is&#xD;
      that the addition of Vorinostat and low-dose dexamethasone to Lenalidomide (ZLd), in patients&#xD;
      experiencing a biochemical relapse during a Lenalidomide maintenance ongoing therapy, can&#xD;
      overcome Lenalidomide-drug resistance and result in a significant response rate, that can&#xD;
      translate into a significant improvement in survival of MM patients. The second hypothesis is&#xD;
      that, since the dose of Lenalidomide commonly administered in maintenance therapy, is 10 mg&#xD;
      days 1-21 every 28 days, the increase in Lenalidomide dose to the standard dose used for&#xD;
      relapsing patients, plus low-dose Dexamethasone (Ld), in patients experiencing a biochemical&#xD;
      relapse during a Lenalidomide ongoing maintenance, can as well overcome Lenalidomide-drug&#xD;
      resistance and determine a significant response rate, that can translate into a significant&#xD;
      improvement in survival of MM patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multicenter non comparative, randomized, open label, phase II study. Patients, who&#xD;
      are receiving Lenalidomide maintenance treatment with or without prednisone, will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1: ZLd association:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lenalidomide orally at the dose of 25 mg/day for 21 days every 28 days Vorinostat orally at&#xD;
      the dose of 400 mg/day on days 1-7 and 15- 21 on a 28-day cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexamethasone orally at the dose of 40 mg day 1,8, 15, 22 every 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2: Ld association:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lenalidomide orally at the dose of 25 mg/day for 21 days every 28 days Dexamethasone orally&#xD;
      at the dose of 40 mg day 1,8, 15, 22 every 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients must have a -confirmed diagnosis of relapsed multiple myeloma. In this Phase II&#xD;
      study, a total of up to 35 patients in the ZLd cohort and 48 in the Ld cohort will be&#xD;
      enrolled. It is anticipated that full accrual to this study will take approximately 36&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
