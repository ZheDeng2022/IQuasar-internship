      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To observe BDR distribution curve for Chinese non-asthmatic and controller-naïve&#xD;
           asthmatic children from 4-12 years respectively&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare BDR values between non-asthmatic group and controller-naïve asthmatic group,&#xD;
           and analyze appropriate cut-off point value&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background and rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the guidelines spirometry, including baseline forced expiratory volume in 1&#xD;
      second (FEV1) and the bronchodilator response (BDR) to short acting beta agonists (SABA),&#xD;
      should be used in children as objective measures to establish the diagnosis and severity of&#xD;
      bronchial asthma. Baseline FEV1 is usually in the normal range (greater than 80% predicted)&#xD;
      in children, regardless of asthma severity, so several other objective measures have been&#xD;
      suggested for diagnosis in children, including the response to a bronchodilator, which&#xD;
      reflects airway reversibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current definition for a positive BDR is &gt;12% reversibility. In the study carried out by&#xD;
      Galant et al among 51 non-asthmatic children and 346 controller naïve asthmatic children&#xD;
      between 4-17 years, the BDR value could achieve 12% in only 30.6% asthmatic children, across&#xD;
      all severity. Also, in a study among 142 children between 5-10 years in UK, 9% increase in&#xD;
      FEV1 after bronchodilator use was suggested as the cutoff point with good sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Difference between the proposed study to be carried out in our hospital and the one in Anhui&#xD;
      Province is that we will tentatively calculate a BDR cutoff point by using receiver operating&#xD;
      characteristic (ROC curve). And the cutoff point can be used as a reference indicator in&#xD;
      asthma diagnosis and long-term management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current BDR cutoff point of 12% that is not ideal for children can also be reflected in&#xD;
      the clinical management. It has been shown that a persistent BDR value, even less than 12%,&#xD;
      in asthmatic children suggests poor clinical outcome. In a 4 years study among 1041 asthmatic&#xD;
      children in America carried out by Sharma et al, it showed that compared with individuals who&#xD;
      had a BDR of 12% and 200ml, individuals who had a BDR of 10% had similar poor clinical&#xD;
      outcomes (e.g. more hospital visits, more prednisone bursts, increased nocturnal awakenings,&#xD;
      and missing more days of school). Same results were also obtained in Galant et al study among&#xD;
      679 asthmatic children among 5-18 years.&#xD;

             3. Chest physical test, record on the form of test.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Standing height and weight will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Calculation of age: The date of test subtracts the date of birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3. Pulmonary function tests&#xD;
&#xD;
           Standardized pulmonary function tests will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Contents of tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Pre and post flow volume: forced volume vital capacity (FVC), FEV0.5, FEV1, FEV1/FVC&#xD;
           ratio, PEF, forced expiratory flow 25 (FEF25), FEF50, FEF75, FEF25-75, forced expiratory&#xD;
           time (FET), back-extrapolated volume (VBE), VBE/FVC.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The BDR is based on pulmonary function measurements before and after administration of&#xD;
           2.5 mg albuterol by nebulizer. BDR is calculated as [(postbronchodilator FEV1- baseline&#xD;
           FEV1)/baseline FEV1] x 100%.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
           1. Spirometry preparation The spirometry was purchased from VIASYS Healthcare, Hochberg&#xD;
           Germany (MasterScope).&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Check: Before switch on, check the conjunction between flow sensor and the hand&#xD;
                knob, ensure that the black compact is tightness.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Calibration: Before calibration, the room temperature, pressure, humidity should be&#xD;
                tested and recorded and all of the parameter should be reconciled to BTPS&#xD;
                condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Using 2 liters scalar to calibrate flow. Every day do the even flow calibration.&#xD;
                Every week do the flow linear calibration, include high, media and low flow these&#xD;
                three different flow calibration. The variety should be less than 3%.&#xD;
&#xD;
                The record of calibration should be printed, and the technician should be signed on&#xD;
                it and save it.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2. Test method The training process is the same as Eigen H. et al (ref 8). The entire&#xD;
           instruction and testing session for each child is strictly limited to 15 min, during&#xD;
           which time children are instructed in the techniques of spirometry and performed at&#xD;
           least three forced vital capacity maneuvers. A highly experienced children's pulmonary&#xD;
           function technologist does the instruction for each child. At the time of testing, each&#xD;
           child is given an explanation of the testing procedure individually and then tested&#xD;
           using coaching techniques used in our pulmonary function laboratory in evaluating&#xD;
           younger children.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3. Criteria for accepting Data (ATS/ERS 2005) The principles of spirometry quality&#xD;
           control in preschool children are the same as for adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. It is necessary to visually inspect the flow-volume and volume-time traces, and&#xD;
                exclude maneuvers that are visibly inadequate. Maneuvers should be excluded if the&#xD;
                flow-volume curve does not demonstrate a rapid rise to peak flow, or a smooth&#xD;
                descending limb, with no evidence of cough or glottis closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. The start of test should be quantified by calculating the VBE. Some investigators&#xD;
                reported that more than 80% of the studied preschool population achieved a VBE of&#xD;
                less than or equal to 80 ml or less than 12.5% of the FVC. Alternative criteria are&#xD;
                presented, but these should be viewed as a guide to assist visual inspection,&#xD;
                rather than as exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. The end of test should be quantified by reporting the point of cessation of flow.&#xD;
                It is known that many preschool children cannot sustain forced expiration for 1&#xD;
                second, let alone the 6 seconds previously stipulated for adults (ref 9) , and the&#xD;
                forced expired time should be reported but should not be used to exclude maneuvers.&#xD;
                This pattern should not be misinterpreted as early termination (ref 10).&#xD;
