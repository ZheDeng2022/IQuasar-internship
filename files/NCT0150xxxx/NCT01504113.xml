      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psoriasis is a chronic, immunologically-mediated, inflammatory skin disease and targeted&#xD;
      therapies e.g. tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and TH-17 antagonists have become increasing&#xD;
      important agents in the management of psoriasis. TNF, interleukin-17 (IL-17) and TH-17 play&#xD;
      major roles in defense against infection. Large-scaled clinical trials and post-marking&#xD;
      surveillance had shown these agents may increase susceptibility to infections. Most studies&#xD;
      evaluate the reactivation of tuberculosis but the influence of targeted therapies on the&#xD;
      viral infection has not been extensively investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TNF-α has been shown to contribute to the killing of cytomegalovirus (CMV)- and human&#xD;
      papillomaviruses (HPV)-infected cells. Additionally, recent studies have shown a high&#xD;
      prevalence of HPV DNA in psoriatic skin and increased HPV5 antibodies in patients with&#xD;
      psoriasis. The prevalence of HPV in the skin was also affected by therapeutic modalities,&#xD;
      such as psoralen-ultraviolet A (PUVA). Several case reports in which CMV, Epstein-Barr virus&#xD;
      (EBV) and HPV infection complicated therapy with TNF-α antagonists have been reported.&#xD;
      However, the study investigated the effect of TNF-α antagonists and other biologics on&#xD;
      reactivation of latent viruses is limited. Only two studies investigated the short-term&#xD;
      effect of infliximab on reaction of herpesviruses in patients of rheumatoid arthritis and&#xD;
      Crohn's disease. The high prevalence of combination use of immunosuppressants, such as&#xD;
      methotrexate alongside with TNF-α antagonists in these patients is different from patients&#xD;
      with psoriasis. Additionally, various bacterium and fungi, such as Staphylococcus aureus,&#xD;
      Malassezia are associated with provocation and/or exacerbation of psoriasis and recent&#xD;
      studies had shown IL-17 is essential for the immune response to common fungus Candida&#xD;
      albicans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to prospectively investigate the effect of target therapies (TNF-α,&#xD;
      TH-17 antagonist, IL-17 antagonists, tofacitinib and apremilast) on the activation of&#xD;
      viruses, including CMV, EBV and HPV and the impact of biologics on the prevalence of surface&#xD;
      colonization of microorganism, including HPV, bacteria and fungi, in patients with psoriasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our project consists of two related study. The first (Study 1), a prospective observational&#xD;
      study, included patients with psoriasis who are going to undergo biologics therapy, the viral&#xD;
      loads of CMV and EBV, HPV DNA detection in eyebrow hairs and skin scales, and bacterial,&#xD;
      fungal cultures from skin scales were performed before the initiation, 12 and 24 weeks after&#xD;
      initiation of the target therapies, 12 weeks after discontinuation of target therapies. This&#xD;
      part of our project is to investigate the dynamic effect of biologics on the microorganisms&#xD;
      in patients with psoriasis. The second part (Study 2), a case control study, recruits&#xD;
      psoriasis patients who have started target therapies, they receive the sampling of blood,&#xD;
      eyebrow hairs and skin scales for CMV, EBV and HPV investigations when they are enrolled.&#xD;
      Control group compromised of age-and disease severity-matched psoriasis patients who are not&#xD;
      treating with target therapies or other systemic antipsoriatic agents. Comparison of the&#xD;
      prevalence of latent virus, virus reactivation, bacteria and fungi skin colonization between&#xD;
      psoriasis patients who are treating with and without target therapies is performed. The aim&#xD;
      of study 2 was to assess any difference of the status of latent virus or microorganism&#xD;
      colonization in skins between psoriasis patients treated with and without target therapies.&#xD;

      Introduction As numerous studies have identified TNF-α, TH-17 and IL-17 as particularly major&#xD;
      roles governing the inflammatory cascade in psoriasis, target therapies, including TNF-α and&#xD;
      TH-17 antagonists, have represented major breakthrough in the treatment of psoriasis. It is&#xD;
      well known that TNF-α plays an important role in the immune response to viral infections,&#xD;
      which is attributed to direct inhibition of viral replication, killing of virally infected&#xD;
      cells, induction of FasL-dependent CD8+ T-lymphocyte effector pathways through TNF/TNF&#xD;
      receptor 2 interaction and promote inflammatory response indirectly.Additionally, it has been&#xD;
      shown that treatment with TNF-α antagonists is associated increased viral replication in&#xD;
      virus-inoculated rats, progressive loss of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and decreased level of TNF-α&#xD;
      and interferon. A transient decreased T cell responsiveness was also observed in some&#xD;
      patients treated with TNF-α antagonists.10 TNF-α can inhibit CMV production in certain cell&#xD;
      types and the CMV major immediate early promoter is inhibited by TNF-α. Increased TNF&#xD;
      production has been reported during CMV infection, which also displays anti-CMV activity in&#xD;
      vitro.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TNF-α is also involved in direct control of HPV infection by induction of apoptosis of&#xD;
      HPV-infected cells, arresting growth of HPV-infected keratinocytes and down-regulation of&#xD;
      HPV-gene transcription, stimulation of inflammatory response and up-regulation of HLA class I&#xD;
      components in antigen-presenting cells. E6 protein of HPV-16 is known to directly bind to TNF&#xD;
      receptor 1 and abrogate TNF-induced apoptosis of the host cells. Recent studies have shown a&#xD;
      high prevalence of HPV DNA in psoriatic skin and increased HPV5 antibodies in patients with&#xD;
      psoriasis. It seems that psoriatic skin may be specifically permissive for HPV. Increased pap&#xD;
      smear abnormalities has been observed in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases receiving&#xD;
      TNF-α antagonists. However, the specific effects of anti-TNF therapy on HPV carriage and&#xD;
      HPV-associated disease remain unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is associated with several B-cell and epithelial-cell malignancies,&#xD;
      especially in patients under the immunosuppressive treatment. Increased risk of&#xD;
      lymphoproliferative disorders in patients treated with TNF-α antagonists has been addressed.&#xD;
      Case reports of EBV-associated lymphoproliferative diseases that regressed after withdrawal&#xD;
      of anti-TNF-α drugs had been also described. Thus, the concern of the increased risk at least&#xD;
      in part caused by immunosuppression of anti-TNF therapy, which may cause a consecutive EBV&#xD;
      reactivation, emerged but was not proven yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anti-TNF-α drugs, including monoclonal antibody against TNF-α (infliximab and adalimumab) and&#xD;
      soluble TNF receptor (etanercept), are recognized as a risk factor for opportunistic&#xD;
      infections. A recent study demonstrated a higher risk of opportunistic infections for&#xD;
      patients receiving adalimumab than etanercept, with a 10- to 17-fold differences in risk.&#xD;
      However, most knowledge of latent viral reactivation during anti-TNF treatment has come from&#xD;
      studies of patients with inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis. Moreover, these&#xD;
      studies mainly focus on herpesviruses and viral hepatitis. Several case reports in which EBV,&#xD;
      CMV,and HPV infection complicated therapy with TNF-α antagonists in patients with psoriasis&#xD;
      have also been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IL-17 is a proinflammatory cytokine that is produced by a variety of cells, including a newly&#xD;
      identified subset of activated CD4+ T cells (Th17 cells), γδT cells, CD8+ cells and NKT&#xD;
      cells. There is evidence to support a protective role for IL-17 in the host defense against&#xD;
      extracellular bacterial infections, including Klebsiella pneumonia,38 Bacteroides fragilis&#xD;
      and Escherichia coli. A recent study also showed IL-17 is essential for human immunity&#xD;
      against common fungus Candida albicans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various bacteria and fungi are reported to be associated with provocation and/or exacerbation&#xD;
      of psoriasis. The strongest evidence exists for the induction of guttate psoriasis by a&#xD;
      preceding tonsilar Streptococcus pyogenes infection. Balci et al also found significant&#xD;
      higher rates of Staphylococcus aureus colonization in lesional skin and nares of the patients&#xD;
      with psoriasis than healthy controls. They also suggested a significant relationship between&#xD;
      PASI scores and both S. aureus cultivation and toxin production in lesional skin of the&#xD;
      patients with psoriasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the studies investigating the impact of TNF-α, TH-17, IL-17 antagonists and other&#xD;
      targeted agents in patients with psoriasis are limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim： In Taiwan, the seropositive rate of CMV is approximately 50% for school age children and&#xD;
      more than 90% for adults. EBV causes a persistent infection of B lymphocytes in more than 90%&#xD;
      of the adult population worldwide.46 Thus, the importance of investigating the influence of&#xD;
      target therapies on the latent viruses and other microorganisms can't be overemphasized. The&#xD;
      aim of this study is to prospectively investigate the effect of TNF-α, TH-17 and IL-17&#xD;
      antagonists administration on the activation of viruses, including CMV, EBV and HPV and the&#xD;
      impact of biologics on the prevalence of surface colonization of microorganism, including&#xD;
      HPV, bacteria and fungi, in patients with psoriasis. The microbial effect of novel targeted&#xD;
      agents, like tofacitinib, secukinumab and apremilast, will also be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Patients Characteristics and Study Schedule We include patients with psoriasis who&#xD;
      will receive and who are currently on TNF-α (etanercept and adalimumab) for psoriasis, in a&#xD;
      tertiary referral centre in northern Taiwan (National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH))&#xD;
      between 2011 and 2015. We also include patients who have signed informed consent to use or&#xD;
      participate in the clinical trials and are currently using the target therapies of&#xD;
      ustekinumab, secukinumab, tofacitinib (CP690,550), and apremilast. These clinical trials are&#xD;
      approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the NTUH (NTUH-REC: ustekinumab, 200806022M;&#xD;
      secukinumab, 201104022MA; tofacitinib, 201012013MA; apremilast, 201010022M). Patients&#xD;
      themselves or their guardians have signed informed consent for the study protocols of these&#xD;
      new drugs before entrance to this study. All the participants of our study or their guardians&#xD;
      also need to sign another informed consent of this study, which is approved by the Research&#xD;
      Ethics Committee of the NTUH (NTUH-REC No: 201106079RC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project consists of two related studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients who are planned to receive targeted agents:&#xD;
&#xD;
           This prospective, observational study includes psoriasis patients who are going to&#xD;
           receive targeted agents. After enrollment, CMV and EBV IgG are checked. Patients undergo&#xD;
           the sampling of blood, eyebrow hairs and skin scales before the initiation of biologics&#xD;
           therapy, 12 and 24 weeks after initiation of the target therapies, 12 weeks after&#xD;
           discontinuation of target therapies. Blood samples are sent to check viral load, and CMV&#xD;
           and EBV viral load are determined by real-time PCR. Bacterial, fungal cultures and HPV&#xD;
           DNA detection of skin scales are also performed. HPV typing is determined by genechip&#xD;
           and semi-quantitative measurement of HPV viral load is done. Demographic data and the&#xD;
           activity parameters of the psoriasis, such as psoriasis area and severity index (PASI),&#xD;
           are collected at baseline and each study visit. The aim of this study is to investigate&#xD;
           the dynamic effect of target therapies administration on the microorganisms, including&#xD;
           CMV, EBV, HPV, bacteria and fungi in patients with psoriasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients who have received targeted therapy The second part of our project, a&#xD;
           case-control study, includes psoriasis patients who have received targeted agents for&#xD;
           more than 3 months. We also recruit age-and disease severity-matched psoriasis patients&#xD;
           who are not treating with targeted agents or other systemic antipsoriatic agents as a&#xD;
           control group. Likewise, after enrollment, CMV and EBV IgG are checked. HPV detection,&#xD;
           bacterial, fungal cultures of the skin scales were done. Comparison of the prevalence of&#xD;
           latent virus, virus reactivation, bacteria and fungi skin colonization between psoriasis&#xD;
           patients who are treating with and without target therapies is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the microorganism examinations are repeated again 12 weeks after the&#xD;
      discontinuation of target therapies. The dynamic changes of viral serology, bacterial and&#xD;
      fungal cultivation data after stopping target therapies are analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this part of our study was to assess any difference of the status of latent virus&#xD;
      or microorganism colonization in skins between psoriasis patients treated with and without&#xD;
      target therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scale sampling on the nonlesional skins for HPV The sampling areas will be first cleaned with&#xD;
      Hibitane and gentlely taped with adhesive tapes to remove surface contamination. Then a&#xD;
      superficial skin scraping is taken from the head and neck areas, as far as possible from any&#xD;
      psoriatic plaques, using a fine sandpaper to abrade the stratum corneum and collecting the&#xD;
      debris for HPV detection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cultivation of bacteria and fungi on the skin folds After clearing sampling areas with&#xD;
      Hibitane, skin swab samples are taken from skin folds, including retroauricular areas,&#xD;
      inguinal or axillary areas, by using a sterile cotton swab dipped in double-distilled water&#xD;
      and then a gentle swabbing of the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hair sampling for HPV Eyebrows are plucked with new tweezers used for each subject. Only&#xD;
      hairs containing intact hair follicles are collected for HPV studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of viral loads&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative PCR for CMV and EBV viral load Whole blood specimens were stored at - 80 ◦C&#xD;
      before testing. DNA was extracted from 400μL of sample with the MagNA Pure Compact Nucleic&#xD;
      Acid Isolation kit I using the MagNA Pure Compact Instrument (Roche Diagnostics). The volume&#xD;
      of solution was 100μL. Viral DNAs were then amplified using the &quot;in-house&quot; real-time PCR&#xD;
      assays implemented in the laboratory for virological diagnosis. For CMV, real-time PCR assays&#xD;
      based on hydrolysis probe technology were used, as described previously.48 For EBV, the&#xD;
      &quot;in-house&quot;real-time PCR assay using hybridization probes was carried out, as reported&#xD;
      previously.49 CMV amplification was performed on the ABI PRISM® 7500 (Applied Biosystems,&#xD;
      Courtaboeuf, France) using the following cycle parameters: 2 min at 50 ◦C and 10 min at 95&#xD;
      ◦C, followed by 45 cycles each consisting of 15 s at 95 ◦C and 1 min at 60 ◦C (ramprates of&#xD;
      0.8 ◦C/s up and 1.6 ◦C/s down; 9600 emulation mode). EBV assay was carried out on the&#xD;
      LightCycler® 1.5 (LC1.5; Roche Diagnostics). EBV assay was performed with the following cycle&#xD;
      parameters: 1 min at 50 ◦C and 8 min at 95 ◦C, followed by 45 cycles each consisting of 10 s&#xD;
      at 95 ◦C, 15 s at 58 ◦C and 15 s at 72 ◦C, and a cooling step of 1 min at 40 ◦C (ramp rate of&#xD;
      20 ◦C/s). Real-time PCR assays were performed in parallel on the LC480, after slight&#xD;
      adaptations from the initial protocols. Ten microliters of extracted DNA were amplified in&#xD;
      25μL of mixture containing 1 × LightCycler® 480 Probes Master, 200 nM forward primer, 200 nM&#xD;
      reverse primer, 100 nM hydrolysis probe, 0.38 units uracil-N-glycosylase (Invitrogen,&#xD;
      Cergy-Pontoise, France). For EBV, the hybridization probe labeled with LC-Red 640 was used as&#xD;
      a FAM-labeled hydrolysis probe.49 The sequences of all primers and probes used in LC480&#xD;
      protocols are indicated in Table 1. Cycling conditions on LC480 were as follows: 2 min at 50&#xD;
      ◦C and 10 min at 95 ◦C, followed by 45 cycles each consisting of 15 s at 95 ◦C and 40 s at 60&#xD;
      ◦C, and a cooling step of 30 s at 40 ◦C (ramp rate of 4.4 ◦C/s). For CMV and EBV assays,&#xD;
      quantitation was achieved with a standard curve generated from 10-fold serial dilutions of&#xD;
      viral DNA extracted from infected cell cultures and quantified using a plasmid. In order to&#xD;
      detect potential PCR inhibitors, all DNA extracts were tested undiluted and at a dilution of&#xD;
      1:10. Results were expressed logarithmically (viral copy number/mL). Given the extraction&#xD;
      dilution, the sensitivity threshold was 1.4 logs for all assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HPV genotyping and semiquantitative HPV viral load The HPV genechip (Easychip HPV Genotyping&#xD;
      Array, King Car, Taipei, Taiwan) will offer an revert-blot hybridization to detect 39&#xD;
      subtypes of HPV DNA (6, 11, 16, 18, 26, 31, 32, 33, 35, 37, 39, 42, 43, 44, 45, 51, 52, 53,&#xD;

      and MM8) in a single reaction, as reported by Huang et al. The nested multiplex PCR products&#xD;
      of L1 region of HPV of each specimen will be hybridized with a genechip. The other set of&#xD;
      nested PCR will be also performed for skin typed HPV which consisted of FAP59/64 and&#xD;
      Fap6319R/6085F and DNA sequencing analysis.will be performed for the product to rule out the&#xD;
      presence of coinfection. The genechip is able to detect multiple infection and the&#xD;
      skin-directed PCR sequencing can only detect one serotype of HPV at one time. Internal&#xD;
