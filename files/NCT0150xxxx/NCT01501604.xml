  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In people whos cancers have a PIK3CA mutation, this trial will be evaluating the drug BKM120&#xD;
      as a possible treatment. BKM120 works by blocking the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase&#xD;
      (PI3K)pathway, thereby inhibiting tumor growth and survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to learn if the study drug BKM120 can shrink or slow the growth&#xD;
      of your tumor. The safety of BKM120 will also be studied. Your physical state, symptoms,&#xD;
      change in the size of your tumor, and laboratory findings obtained while you are on study&#xD;
      will help the research team decide if BKM120 is safe and effective in patients with advanced&#xD;
      cancers.&#xD;

      Subjects enrolled in this study will receive BKM120 once daily, orally, in cycles of 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Cycles 1 and 2, the following tests and procedures will be done on days 1 and 15:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  performance status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  pregnancy test (if applicable)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  neuropsychiatric assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting at Cycle 2 and then every other cycle thereafter (approximately every 8 weeks) tumor&#xD;
      assessment will be performed by CT/MRI or PET scan. A chest x-ray will also be performed&#xD;
      every 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beginning with Cycle 3, the following tests/procedures will be performed on Day 1 of each&#xD;
      cycle:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  performance status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  neuropsychiatric assessments&#xD;
