      The purpose of this study is to prospectively evaluate the combined use of the MSKCC nomogram&#xD;
      (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center) and Tenon score to select, in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic sentinel lymph node (SN), those at low risk of metastatic non-SN in whom&#xD;
      additional axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) could be avoided.&#xD;

      EXPERIMENTAL PLAN AND COURSE OF STUDY This is a prospective non-randomized non-interventional&#xD;
      multicenter study including the respect of a quality charter and involving a prospective&#xD;
      registration of clinical and histological data to test the hypothesis of a proportion of&#xD;
      false negative rate (=rate of metastatic SN) of 5% +/- 5% within the population at low risk&#xD;
      by the combined use of the MSKCC nomogram and Tenon score. No modification therapy will be&#xD;
      conducted because the scores will not be provided to operators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.1 Conduct of the study 6.1.1 Before and during surgery Every surgeon agreeing to&#xD;
      participate in the study - and thus to respect the quality charter - will make the inclusion&#xD;
      of his eligible patients with an e-CRF which will generate automatically a number of&#xD;
      anonymity. A form of inclusion specifying the number of anonymity of the patient, the&#xD;
      initials of the name and the first name as well as the date of birth of the patient will be&#xD;
      send back by e-mail by the study coordinator and clinical study technician (CST) of the&#xD;
      URC-Est. The surgeon will have at his disposal 60 boards of labels of anonymity elaborated by&#xD;
      the CST of the URC-Est corresponding to 30 patients (2 boards of labels by patient). The&#xD;
      resupplying of labels will be managed by the CST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A label will contain i) the number of anonymity, ii) the address and phone number of the&#xD;
      surgeon, iii) the address and phone number of the pathology laboratory, iv) the address and&#xD;
      phone number of the study coordinator including fax number where pathological results should&#xD;
      be send.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first intervention, the surgeon will send the histological specimen (i.e.&#xD;
      lumpectomy or mastectomy, SN, and possibly non-SN in case the ALND is completed during the&#xD;
      first surgical procedure with a board of labels of anonymity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of additional surgical procedure to complete ALND, the histological specimen (i.e.&#xD;
      non-SN) will be sent to the pathology laboratory with the second board of label of anonymity&#xD;
      corresponding to this patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The laboratory of pathology will have to label with anonymity labels all histological reports&#xD;
      that should be sent to the study coordinator. To eventually calculate combined prediction&#xD;
      (MSKCC nomogram and Tenon score) and ensure respect of the quality charter, specific data&#xD;
      must appear in the pathology report:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical information: age of the patient, the location of the primitive tumor (upper&#xD;
           outer quadrant, SUPERO-medial, INFERO-lateral, INFERO-internal retroareolar or other),&#xD;
           palpable tumor or not, the results of histological or cytological diagnosis performed&#xD;
           preoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regarding the number of lumpectomy: size of invasive cancer (largest diameter),&#xD;
           histologic type, associated intra ductal carcinoma (type and percentage), existence of&#xD;
           vascular or lymphatic emboli, estrogen receptor status, progesterone receptor status,&#xD;
           HER-2-neu status, SCAFF and Bloom-Richardson grade or equivalent, if realized, the level&#xD;
           of expression of antigen Ki 67; regarding sentinel lymph nodes: number of SN harvested ;&#xD;
           for each metastatic SN: type of metastasis: macrometastasis, micrometastasis, isolated&#xD;
           cells, method of intraoperative diagnosis of metastasis (if performed): frozen section,&#xD;
           cytology, RT-PCR. Final pathologic exam: routine H&amp;E, serial sectioning H&amp;E, IHC.&#xD;
           Regarding non-sentinel lymph nodes: number of non-SN&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  number of metastatic non-SN, postoperative TNM. 6.1.2 Collection of histological results&#xD;
           from the pathology laboratories The study data will be informed through pathology&#xD;
           reports. Ten weeks after receiving the e-CRF, the CST of the URC-EST under the&#xD;
           responsibility of the study coordinator will contact the pathology laboratory. The&#xD;
           latter will label with anonymity labels all histology reports corresponding to the first&#xD;
           and possibly, if an additional ALND has further been done, and will fax reports to the&#xD;
           study coordinator(fax number on the label).&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.2 Procedure to calculate the risk of non-SN involvement A calculation of the probability of&#xD;
      metastatic non-SN using the MSKCC nomogram and the the Tenon score will be performed for all&#xD;
      patients. Calculations will be implemented under the responsibility of coordinating doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The result of these calculations will not be communicated to surgeons. 6.2.1 Calculating the&#xD;
      score of Tenon&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Variable 1: Existence of macrometastasis in a non-SN: if macrometastases, 2 points are&#xD;
           assigned, 0 otherwise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Variable 2: histological size of invasive tumor: 3 points if the tumor is greater than&#xD;
           20 mm, 1.5 points if the size is in 10 and 20 mm and 0 points if less than 10 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Variable 3: Ratio between the number of metastatic SN (whatever the type of metastasis&#xD;
           (macrometastasis, micrometastasis or isolated tumor cells)) and the number of SN&#xD;
           harvested: 2 points if the ratio is 1; 1 point if between 0.5 and 1, and 0 points if&#xD;
           less than 0.5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scores for the 3 variables are then added together to calculate the score of Tenon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.2.2 Calculation of risk by the MSKCC nomogram This calculation involves 8 variables: 1)&#xD;
      histological type associated with SBR grade (infiltrating ductal carcinoma grade 1, grade 2,&#xD;
      grade 3 and invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC)), 2) the existence of a LYMPHO-vascular invasion&#xD;
      (LVI) (yes, no), 3) the multifocal nature of the tumor (yes, no), 4) status of estrogen&#xD;
      receptor (present, absent), 4) the number of non-metastatic SN (0 to 14), 5) the number of&#xD;
      metastatic SN (from 1 to 7), 6) the size of the tumor (from 0 to 9 cm), 7) method of&#xD;
      detecting metastases in the SN. For the latter, there are 2 different situations: when using&#xD;
      the technique CRYOCONGELATION, 4 items were proposed (CRYOCONGELATION analysis, analysis by&#xD;
      H&amp;E : routine H&amp;E and serial sectioning H&amp;E, and IHC), and in the absence of use of&#xD;
      technology by cryocongelation only 3 items were proposed (analysis by H&amp;E : routine H&amp;E and&#xD;
      serial sectioning H&amp;E, and IHC).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The calculation must be done using the calculator developed by the authors and easily&#xD;
           accessible on the website http://www.mskcc.org/MSKCC/htlm/5794.cfm.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  First Row &quot;Performed Frozen Section. The item must be checked if the pathologist&#xD;
                has performed frozen section intra-operatively. Otherwise, the item must not be&#xD;
                checked.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Second line &quot;Pathological size (cm)&quot; must refer the histological size of the&#xD;
                largest tumor diameter in centimeters.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Third line &quot;Tumor type and grade&quot;: you must select the corresponding item from the&#xD;
                4 items offered: ductal I (for infiltrating ductal carcinoma (TCC) grade 1), ductal&#xD;
                II (for TCC grade 2), ductal III (for TCC grade 3) and lobular (for infiltrating&#xD;
                lobular carcinoma).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Fourth line &quot;Number of Positive Sentinel Lymph Nodes&quot; must report the number of&#xD;
                metastatic SN, whatever the type of flooding (by macrometastasis a micrometastasis&#xD;
                or isolated cells).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Fifth line &quot;SN Method of Detection&quot;: you must select the item. Two scenarios:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. In the first line item &quot;Frozen Section Performed&quot; was checked: 4 item are then&#xD;
                     offered: Frozen (if the metastasis was diagnosed at the frozen section).&#xD;
                     However, this scenario can not produce it because in this case, the patient&#xD;
                     has received ALND in the same operation as the procedure of SN; Routine (if&#xD;
                     the metastasis was diagnosed by analyzing routine H&amp;E), Serial (if the&#xD;
                     metastasis was diagnosed after serial sectioning in H&amp;E), IHC (if the&#xD;
                     metastasis was diagnosed by IHC)&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. the first line item &quot;Frozen Section Performed&quot; was not checked: 3 item are&#xD;
                     then proposed: Routine (if the metastasis was diagnosed by analyzing routine&#xD;
                     H&amp;E), Serial (if the metastasis was diagnosed after serial sectioning in H&amp;E),&#xD;
                     IHC (if the metastasis was diagnosed by IHC).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Sixth row &quot;Number of Negative Sentinel Lymph Nodes': the number of non-metastatic&#xD;
                SN.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Seventh row &quot;Lymphovascular Invasion.&quot; The item must be checked in case of&#xD;
                lymphatic or vascular emboli.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Eighth row &quot;Multifocality. The item must be checked in case of multifocality.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Ninth Line &quot;Estrogen Receptor Positive&quot;. The item must be checked if the tumor&#xD;
                estrogen receptors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The use of the nomogram (defined as the graphical representation of the model) is not&#xD;
           recommended because the calculation is less precise than the web interface.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.2.3 Risk calculation combining the MSKCC nomogram and the Tenon score&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group at low risk of metastatic non-SN: probability with the MSKCC nomogram of ≤ 10% and&#xD;
           a score of Tenon ≤ 3.5.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group at risk of metastatic non-SN: probability with the MSKCC nomogram of &gt; 10% and/or&#xD;
           Tenon score &gt; 3.5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.3 Monitoring of patients included in the study The study evaluates the combined use of two&#xD;
      predictors at baseline. It does not require monitoring. However, all patients will be&#xD;
      monitored regularly for any breast cancer and adjuvant treatment of breast cancer will remain&#xD;
      unchanged by this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.4 Total time of research The recruitment and the opening of study centers is planned over a&#xD;
      period of 6 months. Inclusion of patients is planned over a period of 18 months. The total&#xD;
      duration of the study is 24 months.&#xD;
