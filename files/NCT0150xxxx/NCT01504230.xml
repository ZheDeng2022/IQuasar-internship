  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoporosis is a prevalent health concern among older adults and is associated with an&#xD;
      increased risk of falls that can cause fracture, injury and even mortality. Identifying the&#xD;
      factors related to falls occur within this population is essential for the development of&#xD;
      effective regimes for fall prevention. The long-term objectives of this work are to ascertain&#xD;
      the mechanisms for effectively controlling balance in seniors with osteoporosis and to&#xD;
      provide a basis for developing fall prevention programs. The entire body's center of mass&#xD;
      (CoM) is a critical indicator for balance control and the coordination among joints and&#xD;
      muscles to control the CoM is still unclear. The aim1 of this study is to develop&#xD;
      biomechanical models that control the entire body's center of mass (CoM) during upright quiet&#xD;
      stance in seniors with osteoporosis. The aim2 of this study is to identify the mechanism to&#xD;
      control the entire body's CoM after receiving a balance perturbation in seniors with&#xD;
      osteoporosis. The findings of this research can provide needed information regarding the&#xD;
      processes of balance control in this vulnerable osteoporosis population, and has the&#xD;
      potential to be applied to individuals with other neuromuscular and orthopedic deficits.&#xD;
