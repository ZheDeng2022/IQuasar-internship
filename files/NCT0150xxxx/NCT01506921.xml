  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Racemic ketamine and S-ketamine are used in clinical practice today. Little is known of their&#xD;
      difference in effect on cerebral blood flow, volume and metabolism. cerebral blood flow (CBF)&#xD;
      measuring techniques are limited in time so constant measurement to mirror a dynamic process&#xD;
      is impossible or very difficult. A novel MRI application, arterial spin labeling, offers the&#xD;
      possibility that without radiation or contrast, to measure semi-continuous CBF with&#xD;
      measurements every 60-120 seconds. The investigators will give 14 healthy volunteers both&#xD;
      study drugs in a randomised sequence with one week apart and measure regional CBF during the&#xD;
      study period of 45 minutes after a sub-anaesthetic bolus dose of 0,6 mg/kg racemic ketamine&#xD;
      and 0,3 mg/kg S-ketamine The investigators hypothesize that there is no difference between&#xD;
      racemic ketamine and S(+)-ketamine with regards to Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) measured&#xD;
      cerebral blood flow.&#xD;

      In this investigator-initiated randomised, double-blinded, crossover study, adult healthy&#xD;
      volunteers will be randomised to receive, as 60-second iv bolus injections on two different&#xD;
      occasions with at least seven days interval, 0.3 mg kg of S-ketamine (Ketanest® 5.0 mg/ ml,&#xD;
      Pfizer, USA) or 0.6 mg/kg of racemic ketamine (Ketalar® 10 mg/ml, Pfizer, USA) supplied by&#xD;
      the hospital pharmacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The volunteers will consecutively be given specific inclusion numbers and randomized&#xD;
      according to a schedule with corresponding randomization codes prepared in advance by the&#xD;
      Research &amp; Development Centre of the Skåne Region, Skåne University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.&#xD;
      Before each investigation, a sealed envelope marked with the corresponding inclusion number,&#xD;
      will be opened in a separate room by a nurse not taking further part in the study. The nurse&#xD;
      prepared the study drug according to the randomization code in a 20 ml syringe based on a&#xD;
      bodyweight-based dosing schedule, and diluted the study drug with saline to a total volume of&#xD;
      20 ml. The prepared syringe, marked with the inclusion number, date and signature, will be&#xD;
      handed over to the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After an initial 10-minute period of dynamic baseline measurements, the study drug will be&#xD;
      injected manually by the investigator. ASL measurements will be made over a 45-minute study&#xD;
      period starting from the injection of study drug, and the volunteer will be brought to the&#xD;
      preparation room for at least 60 minutes of further supervision until clinical routine&#xD;
      criteria for postoperative discharge will be met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fourteen healthy (American Society of Anaesthesiologists physical status 1) adult volunteers&#xD;
      will be included after physical examinations and individual written informed consents. Female&#xD;
      subjects will be required to use effective anti-conception methods during the study period.&#xD;
      The volunteers will have to refrain from caffeine, nicotine, alcohol and medications for 72&#xD;
      hours, and fast for six hours, but will be allowed to drink water until two hours before each&#xD;
      ASL-MRI investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each volunteer will be offered ear plugs, asked to rest with eyes closed during the scanning&#xD;
      procedure, and left undisturbed throughout the study period. Oxygen 2 l/min will be delivered&#xD;
      by nasal cannula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A hand vein will be cannulated with a 20 G (1.1 mm) 45 mm teflon catheter for injection of&#xD;
      study drug, and a balanced glucose solution will be infused at a rate of 1.0 ml/kg/h iv. The&#xD;
      radial artery will be cannulated at wrist level with a 20 G 45 mm teflon catheter after local&#xD;
      infiltration with 2-3 ml of lidocaine. Each volunteer will be connected to an N-MRI2-01&#xD;
      monitoring device recording the ECG, invasive blood pressure, SpO2, ETCO2 and respiratory&#xD;
      rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitored data will be sampled minutely throughout the study period, saved onto a PC card and&#xD;
      analyzed with the Datex-Ohmeda S/5Collect version 4.0™ software package.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arterial blood for blood gas analysis was obtained at baseline and at 1, 5, 10 and 15 min&#xD;
      after injection of the study drug. Analyses were made on a Radiometer ABL800 FLEX device The&#xD;
      ASL data will be acquired using a 3 Tesla MRI unit. A three-dimensional (3D) GRASE pulse&#xD;
      sequence will be employed (2), using a labeling and saturation schedule based on FAIR (3) and&#xD;
      Q2TIPS (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug-induced changes in regional perfusion will be monitored over time using a single&#xD;
      inversion time (TI) of 2000 ms and repeated 115 times, and a repetition time (TR) of 3000 ms.&#xD;
      For multiple TI, ten time points were acquired with a starting point at TI = 300 ms and an&#xD;
      increment of 300 ms between time points, the total inflow time was 1400 ms and the TR was set&#xD;
      to 3700 ms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data sets will be preprocessed using realign tools of the Statistical Parameters Mapping&#xD;
      version 8.0 (SPM8) software package (Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London, UK;&#xD;
      http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm) and executed in the Matlab 7.11 software package. The&#xD;
      labeled and control images will be pair-wise subtracted to produce CBF-weighted ASL images&#xD;
      from re-aligned control/tag images, and these difference maps were denoised using an&#xD;
      established wavelet-domain filtering method (5), and an in-house software program written in&#xD;
      IDL 7.1 (ITT Visual Information Solutions, Boulder, CO, USA). Values of CBF (in ml/100g/min)&#xD;
      will be calculated using a general kinetic model (6) according to the Buxton equation CBF&#xD;
      values will be determined by drawing different numbers of symmetrical cerebral regions of&#xD;
      interest (ROI) bilaterally to outline the grey matter of the frontal lobes, parietal lobes,&#xD;
      temporal lobes, occipital lobes, insular cortex, anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate,&#xD;
      thalamus, caudate nucleus and putamen. Global CBF values will determined by drawing a large&#xD;
      ROI to outline the whole brain tissue within the skull.&#xD;
