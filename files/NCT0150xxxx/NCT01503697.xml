      Technetium-99m NC100692 Injection is under development as a diagnostic radiopharmaceutical&#xD;
      for targeting angiogenesis associated with diseases such as primary and metastatic cancer,&#xD;
      and for targeting active fibrosis in cardiac diseases such as developing heart failure and&#xD;
      developing hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A principle goal of imaging is identification of disease processes early in their&#xD;
      development, at times prior to symptoms. In cancer, angiogenesis is essential for a tumour to&#xD;
      exceed approximately 1-2 mm3 in size.As markers of angiogenesis are often expressed early in&#xD;
      the growth of a tumour it is postulated that imaging of angiogenesis can assist in early&#xD;
      diagnosis of cancer, relapse or spread, and monitoring response to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technetium-99m NC100692 Injection will be tested on 3 populations of pts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.30 patients at high risk For breast cancer 2.30 patients with breast cancer 3.15 patients&#xD;
      with locally advanced breast cancer undergoing treatment.&#xD;

      Angiogenesis is the formation of new blood vessels from the existing vascular bed. Certain&#xD;
      integrins are upregulated while angiogenesis and myocardial fibrogenesis. Therefore,&#xD;
      targeting an integrin with an imaging agent can be potentially useful for the early diagnosis&#xD;
      of angiogenesis and/or fibrogenesis of malignant processes and myocardial remodelling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trail design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study cohort will include 30 patients. After the IV injection of 630-700 MBq 99mTc-NC100692&#xD;
      each breast will be imaged in CC and oblique views using the MBI system. Scintigarphic&#xD;
      findings will be correlated with tissue diagnosis and or/ imaging and clinical follow- up of&#xD;
      at least 6 months as well as with MRI, if performed, in order to determine the PPV and the&#xD;
      NPV of the technology of MBI with labeled NC100692 for detection of tumors and&#xD;
      differentiating benign and malignant breast lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 2 :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study cohort will include 30 patients with breast cancer referred for 18-FDG PET-CT for&#xD;
      staging or re-staging. In addition to the PET-CT study, scintimammography using the MBI&#xD;
      system and whole-body scintigraphy using the Infinia gamma-camera will be performed after the&#xD;
      IV injection of 630-700 MBq 99mTc-NC100692. Imaging with 99mTc-NC100692 will be take place&#xD;
      first followed by 18-FDG PET-CT, on the same day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detection of the primary tumor, lymph nodes and remote metastasis by the various modalities&#xD;
      and tracers will be correlated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study cohort will include 15 patients with locally advanced breast cancer. Patients will&#xD;
      undergo scintimammography with the MBI system (for the breast) and SPECT of the axilla and&#xD;
      thorax (for regional lymph nodes) with the Infinia gamma camera, after the IV injection of&#xD;
      630-700 MBq 99mTc-NC100692 prior to treatment and at its end. The results of the follow-up&#xD;
      studies will be correlated with histological findings in patients referred for surgery and&#xD;
      with MRI in others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the exam, patients will answer a detailed questionnaire about medical and family&#xD;
      history,findings on other imaging modalities and,therpy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be guided by the study coordinator before answering the questionnaire&#xD;
      Reading of the 99mTc-NC100692 studies will be in a blinded mode to other imaging data,&#xD;
      separately by two nuclear medicine experts and then in consensus. Mammography, US and MRI&#xD;
      will be reviewed by a breast imaging.&#xD;
