      Low levels of dehydration (the loss of body water corresponding to 2% of the body weight),&#xD;
      deteriorate physical and cognitive performance and may also be linked to a number of chronic&#xD;
      diseases. The standard test used for the assessment of hydration status is plasma osmolality.&#xD;
      This blood test is invasive, requires time and laboratory equipment and is not accurate for&#xD;
      isotonic dehydration. The goal of this project is to determine whether a new molecular&#xD;
      technology, saliva-based Stress Response Profiling (SRP) biomarkers, could be used for&#xD;
      non-invasive diagnostics of dehydration.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Dehydration, or the loss of body water, is a common health problem during military&#xD;
      operations, athletic events and illness, particularly in children and the elderly.&#xD;
      Warfighters frequently become dehydrated when training or fighting in hot and mountainous&#xD;
      environments because heat and high altitude increase body water losses. The negative&#xD;
      consequences of dehydration worsen as body water losses increase. Severe dehydration (&gt;10%)&#xD;
      is a life-threatening emergency that may result in heat illness, seizures, permanent brain&#xD;
      damage or death. The most common type of dehydration is caused by sweat loss during heavy&#xD;
      physical labor or exercise (hypertonic dehydration). A different type of dehydration can be&#xD;
      caused by blood loss, burns, diarrhea, vomiting or diuretic drugs used for example by&#xD;
      diabetics (isotonic dehydration). Despite the critical importance of proper fluid balance to&#xD;
      human performance and health, no field-expedient, non-invasive dehydration test is available&#xD;
      for either form of dehydration. The ultimate goal of this project is to develop a&#xD;
      field-expedient, non-invasive test for both types of dehydration. The test will be sensitive&#xD;
      to 2% dehydration, a critical threshold for performance impairment and a statistically valid&#xD;
      decision point for hydration assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Fifteen volunteers will be first euhydrated (well-hydrated) and then moderately&#xD;
      dehydrated (2-4%) using two procedures. First, sweat loss during exercise in the heat without&#xD;
      fluids (hypertonic dehydration). Second, excessive urination stimulated by a diuretic pill&#xD;
      called Lasix (isotonic dehydration). SRP biomarkers in saliva samples will be compared to&#xD;
      changes in body weight, and to known hydration indicators in blood and urine. Results will&#xD;
      identify the best SRP biomarkers for diagnosing both types of dehydration and compare&#xD;
      accuracy of the new saliva test to the existing hydration indicators.&#xD;
