      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - During puberty, children begin to develop into adults. Problems with the hormones released&#xD;
      during puberty can affect the reproductive system. Some people have low hormone levels that&#xD;
      severely delay or prevent puberty. Others start puberty abnormally early. Other people may&#xD;
      have a normal puberty but develop reproductive disorders later in life. Researchers want to&#xD;
      study people with reproductive disorders to learn more about how these disorders may be&#xD;
      inherited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To learn how reproductive system disorders may be inherited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  People with one of the following problems:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Abnormally early puberty&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Abnormally late or no puberty&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Normal puberty with hormonal problems that develop later in life&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  People who have not yet had puberty but have symptoms that indicate low hormone levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will provide a blood sample for testing. They will complete a questionnaire&#xD;
           about their symptoms. They will also have a scratch-and-sniff test to study any problems&#xD;
           with their ability to smell.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant medical records will be reviewed. Participants will also provide a family&#xD;
           medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Family members of those in the study may be invited to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment will not be provided as part of this study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The key initiating factors for reproductive development remain among the great mysteries of&#xD;
      pediatric and reproductive endocrinology. The onset of puberty is initiated by pulsatile&#xD;
      secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus. The neuroendocrine&#xD;
      events leading to increased GnRH secretion and the resultant onset of puberty remain largely&#xD;
      unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Isolated deficiency of GnRH results in the rare clinical syndrome of idiopathic&#xD;
      hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH), where decreased secretion of GnRH results in impaired&#xD;
      gonadotropin secretion. The resultant hypogonadism presents with delayed, incomplete, or&#xD;
      absent sexual maturation. Human and animal models have identified a number of genes&#xD;
      responsible for IHH, but more than half of patients with clinical evidence of the disorder do&#xD;
      not have a detectable mutation. In addition, there is significant clinical heterogeneity&#xD;
      among affected individuals, including members of the same family harboring the same&#xD;
      mutations. Careful human phenotyping of such patients and families has expanded our&#xD;
      understanding of this spectrum of disorders to include oligo-digenic inheritence, as well as&#xD;
      reversibility of the condition, and has provided insight into developmental pathways involved&#xD;
      in the ontogeny of GnRH neurons. In particular, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) exists&#xD;
      along a genetic and phenotypic spectrum that includes milder forms of GnRH dysregulation,&#xD;
      precocious and delayed puberty, and onset of reproductive dysfunction after puberty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genetic analysis of subjects with unknown mutations is likely to yield important insights&#xD;
      into additional pathways involved in the regulation of GnRH secretion. Here, we propose a&#xD;
      genetic investigation of subjects with IHH to characterize further the phenotypic effect of&#xD;
      previously described genetic variants, as well as to identify novel genes involved in&#xD;
      congenital GnRH deficiency. We will use both candidate gene and whole exome approaches, as&#xD;
      well as linkage analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol will utilize the disease model of IHH to increase our understanding of the&#xD;
      physiology of GnRH secretion, including the neuroendocrine regulation of GnRH pulsatility.&#xD;
      Examining the genetic characteristics of subjects with isolated GnRH deficiency will reveal&#xD;
      insights into the mechanisms underlying the reawakening of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal&#xD;
      axis at puberty, providing opportunities for new diagnostic capabilities and therapeutic&#xD;
      interventions for disorders of puberty and fertility.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The essential inclusion criteria include:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. failure to go through a normal, age-appropriate, spontaneous puberty and low sex&#xD;
             steroid levels in the setting of low/normal gonadotropins (due to substantial&#xD;
             variability among patient presentations, this will be based on the clinical judgement&#xD;
             of the Investigator), or&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. abnormally early development of puberty, or&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. normal puberty with subsequent development of low gonadotropin levels, or&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. pre-pubertal individuals with features suggestive of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Family members: both affected and unaffected family members are strongly encouraged to&#xD;
             participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Since hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is a rare condition, this protocol remains open to&#xD;
        enrollment so that we may study all subjects that are both qualified and interested in&#xD;
        participating.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Because HH represents a spectrum, where associated clinical findings may provide phenotypic&#xD;
        clues to the assessment of inheritability and underlying physiology, exclusion criteria are&#xD;
        very limited:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have additional pituitary deficiencies, effectively ruling out isolated&#xD;
             GnRH deficiency, whether these deficiencies are congenital or acquired (e.g. secondary&#xD;
             to malignancy, infection, or irradiation).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are taking medications known to affect GnRH secretion, such as&#xD;
             corticosteroids or continuous opiate administration (or were taking them at the time&#xD;
             of diagnosis).&#xD;
