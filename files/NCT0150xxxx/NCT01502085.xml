      Phase IIb clinical trial to determine if resistance to a lenalidomide containing regimen can&#xD;
      be overcome by the addition of vorinostat, in patients with relapsed and refractory multiple&#xD;
      myeloma.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      lenalidomide has been investigated in combination with both lenalidomide and bortezomib&#xD;
      regimens. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is still being studied and that the study&#xD;
      doctors are trying to find out more about it; such as the safest dose to use, the side&#xD;
      effects it may cause, and if the drug is effective for treating relapsed and/or refractory&#xD;
      multiple myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lenalidomide is a drug that alters the immune system and it may also interfere with the&#xD;
      development of tiny blood vessels that help support tumor growth. Therefore, in theory, it&#xD;
      may reduce or prevent the growth of cancer cells. Lenalidomide is approved by the Food and&#xD;
      Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of specific types of myelodysplastic syndrome&#xD;
      (MDS) and in combination with dexamethasone for patients with multiple myeloma (MM) who have&#xD;
      received at least 1 prior therapy. MDS and MM are cancers of the blood. It is currently being&#xD;
      tested in a variety of cancer conditions. In this case it is considered experimental because&#xD;
      the FDA has not approved this combination. Your will receive 25mg of lenalidomide on days&#xD;
      1-21 every 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vorinostat is a drug that interferes with the life sustaining functions of the tumor cells.&#xD;
      It has already received regulatory approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)&#xD;
      for the treatment of T-cell non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma in the United States. The usage of&#xD;
      vorinostat in Multiple Myeloma is experimental (investigational) and has not been approved by&#xD;
      the FDA, but studies in combination with proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib) and&#xD;
      immunomodulatory (lenalidomide) agents are ongoing. You will receive either 400mg of&#xD;
      vorinostat on days 1-7 and 15-21 every 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexamethasone is a steroid that is known to cause cell death in multiple myeloma.&#xD;
      Dexamethasone is FDA approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma and many other disease&#xD;
      states. You will receive either Dexamethasone 40mg for those less than 75 years of age or&#xD;
      20mg for those aged 75 years and above on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 every 28 days In this research&#xD;
      study the investigators are looking to evaluate the safety and efficacy of vorinostat when&#xD;
      combined with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in treating relapsed and/or refractory multiple&#xD;
      myeloma, refractory to lenalidomide.&#xD;
