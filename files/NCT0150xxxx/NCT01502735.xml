      This is a phase 1 study to evaluate the safety of a vaccine (DENV-1 PIV) for the prevention&#xD;
      of dengue fever.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      DENV infections can cause self-limited but incapacitating acute illness lasting four to seven&#xD;
      days. The illness is characterized by fever, headache, severe pain in muscles, joints, pain&#xD;
      behind the eyes, and a rash. DENV infection can be complicated by the development of&#xD;
      hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or shock syndrome (DSS), which is manifested by plasma leakage and a&#xD;
      bleeding diathesis or frank hemorrhage. DHF is fatal in at least 0.5% of pediatric cases but&#xD;
      rarely in adults. People, particularly children, living in hyper-endemic areas who have&#xD;
      antibodies from an earlier dengue infection with one serotype are at increased risk for DHF&#xD;
      if subsequently infected by another dengue virus serotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, no specific anti-viral therapy exists. Therapy is largely supportive. Mosquito&#xD;
      control has failed to prevent dengue transmission; therefore, prevention of dengue through&#xD;
      vaccination is an important objective of the World Health Organization (WHO) and many&#xD;
      national governments, including the United States.&#xD;
