    <textblock>
      Background and rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In clinical practice, antihypertensives are generally prescribed for use in the morning,&#xD;
      whereas some statins are recommended for use in the evening. There is evidence that the&#xD;
      reduction in LDL cholesterol achieved with some statins is superior when taken in the night,&#xD;
      but it is unclear whether the additional reduction in LDL cholesterol(and the reported&#xD;
      improvement in BP control when aspirin is taken in the evening) is offset by a reduction in&#xD;
      adherence when taking medication in the evening. Current product labelling recommends night&#xD;
      use for simvastatin and does not state a timing preference for aspirin or blood pressure&#xD;
      lowering medicines. There is therefore uncertainty concerning the best timing of&#xD;
      administration of the polypill. This uncertainty will be addressed by this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomised, open label cross over trial (n=75) of the polypill in the morning compared with&#xD;
      the evening administration compared with individual agent administration (acetylsalicylic&#xD;
      acid and blood pressure lowering agents in the morning, and statin in the evening) in&#xD;
      individuals at high risk of cardiovascular disease. Patients will be recruited to the RHP 2c&#xD;
      (acetylsalicylic acid 75mg, simvastatin 40mg, lisinopril 10mg, hydrochlorthiazide 12.5mg),&#xD;
      and will be randomly allocated to the sequence of time of administration.&#xD;

      Randomised, open label cross over trial (n=75) of the polypill in the morning compared with&#xD;
      the evening administration compared with individual agent administration (acetylsalicylic&#xD;

      (acetylsalicylic acid 75mg, simvastatin 40mg, lisinopril 10mg, hydrochlorthiazide 12.5mg),&#xD;
      and will be randomly allocated to the sequence of time of administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To measure whether there is a difference in LDL cholesterol levels or the 24 hour ambulatory&#xD;
      blood pressure in individuals at high risk of cardiovascular disease when the polypill is&#xD;
      taken in the morning compared to the evening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation and trial treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible individuals willing to participate in the trial will receive the polypill for a&#xD;
      total of 18 weeks and be randomised to the sequence of 6 weeks morning, 6 weeks evening&#xD;
      administration and 6 weeks administration of the individual agents. The polypill will be&#xD;
      provided by the investigator at the Trial Centre. Participants will also receive information&#xD;
      about smoking cessation (if applicable) and how to follow a healthy heart diet. They will be&#xD;
      advised to increase physical activity and lose weight if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be followed-up for 20 weeks. Ambulatory blood pressure will be measured at&#xD;
      baseline and week 6, week 12 and week 18. Fasting lipids will be measured at baseline, weeks&#xD;
      6, 12 and 18. Tolerability will be assessed at weeks 6, 12, 18 and 20 as will adverse events.&#xD;
      Participant acceptability will be measured at the end of the treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Difference in LDL cholesterol and mean 24 hour ambulatory systolic BP.&#xD;

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant is able to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The trial Investigator considers that each of the polypill components are indicated at&#xD;
             the doses in the Red Heart Pill&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Established atherothrombotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) or intermediate to high&#xD;
             cardiovascular risk, defined as;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History of coronary heart disease (myocardial infarction, stable or unstable&#xD;
                  angina pectoris, or coronary revascularisation procedure), or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History of ischaemic cerebrovascular disease (ischaemic stroke or transient&#xD;
                  ischaemic attack), or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History of peripheral vascular disease (peripheral revascularisation procedure or&#xD;
                  amputation due to vascular disease or aortic reconstruction), or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For individuals without established cardiovascular disease, a calculated 5 year&#xD;
                  CVD risk of 5% or greater (calculated using the 1991 Anderson Framingham risk&#xD;
                  equation with adjustments as defined by the New Zealand Guidelines Group&#xD;
                  recommendations - (Appendix 1))&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Contraindication to any of the components of the polypill (e.g. known intolerance to&#xD;
             aspirin, statins, or ACE inhibitors; pregnancy or likely to become pregnant or&#xD;
             breastfeeding women during the treatment period). Such contraindications are fully&#xD;
             listed in the Investigator Brochures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The treating doctor considers that changing a participant's cardiovascular medications&#xD;
             would put the participant at risk (e.g. symptomatic heart failure, high dose β-blocker&#xD;
             required to manage angina or for rate control in atrial fibrillation, accelerated&#xD;
             hypertension, severe renal insufficiency, a history of severe resistant hypertension).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other potential reasons for exclusion include:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known situation where medication regimen might be altered for a significant length of&#xD;
             time, e.g. current acute cardiovascular event, planned coronary bypass graft&#xD;
             operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unlikely to complete the trial (e.g. life-threatening condition other than&#xD;
             cardiovascular disease) or adhere to the trial procedures or attend study visits (e.g.&#xD;
             major psychiatric condition, dementia).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any reason, medical condition, ongoing medication or significant disability that would&#xD;
             prevent the participant complying with trial consent, treatment and follow-up&#xD;
             procedures or potentially jeopardise her / his medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Night shift workers.&#xD;
