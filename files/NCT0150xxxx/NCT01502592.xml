  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to evaluate the safety of two strategies called &quot;cryoablation&quot; and&#xD;
      &quot;immune therapy&quot; in women with curable early stage breast cancer. &quot;Cryoablation&quot; is a&#xD;
      procedure performed by an expert doctor called a radiologist. The radiologist uses (magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI) to insert a needle directly into a cancer. Very cold temperatures are&#xD;
      then applied through the needle to kill the cancer cells. Some of the killed cancer cells&#xD;
      will be broken into pieces that can be recognized by a person's immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;immune therapy&quot; in this study is a drug called ipilimumab. Normally the immune system&#xD;
      makes &quot;T cells&quot; that can kill cancer cells when turned on. The cancer-killing T cell activity&#xD;
      is controlled by a molecule called CTLA4. Ipilimumab works by turning off CTLA4. Turning off&#xD;
      CTLA4 allows the cancer-fighting T cells to remain active Ipilimumab is an antibody drug has&#xD;
      been made in a laboratory for patient use and was recently approved by the United States Food&#xD;
      and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with a type of skin cancer called&#xD;
      melanoma. An antibody is a normal protein that the immune system uses to find and kill germs&#xD;
      like bacteria and viruses. This study is being done because the researchers believe that when&#xD;
      cryoablation is combined with immune therapy, a person's immune system can be trained to&#xD;
      recognize that person's cancer. This may prevent that cancer from coming back in the future.&#xD;
      In other words, it is hoped that by adding cryoablation with ipilimumab before the&#xD;
      mastectomy, the body will remain cancer free long after the mastectomy is performed. The&#xD;
      first step in determining whether cryoablation and immune therapy can be used to cure breast&#xD;
      cancer is to evaluate the safety of each strategy alone and then in combination in a small&#xD;
      group of patients.&#xD;
