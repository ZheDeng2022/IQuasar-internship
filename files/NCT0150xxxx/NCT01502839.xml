      The purpose of this study is to examine differences in post-concussive (PC) symptom&#xD;
      endorsement among four groups of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF)/Operation Iraqi Freedom&#xD;
      (OIF) Veterans: those with a history of target, service-related, mild traumatic brain injury&#xD;
      (mTBI) and co-occurring posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (Group 1); those with a history&#xD;
      of target, service-related, mTBI only (Group 2); those with PTSD only (Group 3); and those&#xD;
      with no history of target, service-related, mTBI or PTSD (Group 4) by examining scores on the&#xD;
      Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory (NSI). Support for this study is provided by previous&#xD;
      research highlighting the complex relationship between mTBI, PTSD and subsequent PC symptom&#xD;
      endorsement (Brenner et al. 2010; Terrio et al, 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESES ARE AS FOLLOWS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Individuals with a history of target, service-related, mTBI only (Group 2) and&#xD;
           individuals with PTSD only (Group 3) each will report significantly more PC symptoms, as&#xD;
           measured by NSI total scores, when compared to those with no history of service-related&#xD;
           mTBI or PTSD (Group 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Individuals with co-occurring target, service-related, mTBI history and PTSD (Group 1)&#xD;
           will report significantly more PC symptoms, as measured by total NSI scores, than either&#xD;
           those with target, service-related, mTBI only (Group 2) or those with PTSD only (Group&#xD;
           3).&#xD;

      Archival data will be collected from all OEF/OIF Veterans who were seen in the VA ECHCS TBI&#xD;
      Clinic by Nancy Cutter, M.D. and her team between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2010.&#xD;
      Electronic Medical Record (EMR) progress note titles &quot;OEF/OIF TBI 2nd Level Evaluation&#xD;
      Consult Report&quot; and &quot;TBI Consult Report&quot; will be used to identify potential subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power is based on the primary hypothesis that those with PTSD only (Group 3) and those with&#xD;
      target, service-related mTBI only (Group 2) will have significantly more PC symptom reporting&#xD;
      than those with no history of target, service-related mTBI or PTSD (Group 4). Belanger et al.&#xD;
      (2010) reported a standard deviation of 15.3 on the NSI total score in a sample of 134 mTBI&#xD;
      subjects. Assuming variability similar to the Belanger study, a significance level of 0.025&#xD;
      to correct for the two comparisons and 80% power, 180 subjects per group will detect a&#xD;
      clinically significant difference of 5 points. For simplicity, this was calculated using a&#xD;
      two-sided, two-sample t-test. Given that we are modeling all four groups together, pooled&#xD;
      standard error estimates will be used, which will result in slightly higher power.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All analyses will assume a two-sided test of hypothesis with an overall significance level of&#xD;
      0.05, unless otherwise noted, and will be performed in either Statistical Analysis Software&#xD;
      (SAS) v9.2 or above (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic characteristics will be reported as means and standard deviations; medians and&#xD;
      ranges; and proportions, as appropriate. Likewise, characteristics will be compared between&#xD;
      the four aforementioned subject groups using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), chi-square tests&#xD;
      and/or nonparametric tests as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: An ANOVA with reference cell coding will be utilized to model NSI total score&#xD;
      as a function of the four groups (Group 1: Individuals with co-occurring target,&#xD;
      service-related, mTBI and PTSD; Group 2: those with target, service-related, mTBI only; Group&#xD;
      3: those with PTSD only; and Group 4: those with no history of target, service-related, mTBI&#xD;
      or PTSD). Potential confounders will then be assessed individually by adding them to the&#xD;
      model with the groups. If any of the group parameter estimates changes by more than 10% with&#xD;
      the inclusion of the potential confounder, the variable will be utilized in the final model.&#xD;
      Once the final model is determined, a contrast will be set up within the model to test (1)&#xD;
      PTSD only vs. Neither and (2) target, service-related, mTBI only vs. Neither, a Bonferroni&#xD;
      correction will be employed such that the significance level will be adjusted to 0.025 for&#xD;
      these two primary tests. Estimated mean differences will be reported with 95% CIs. Potential&#xD;
      confounding variables to be considered are: age; gender; total number of deployments; time&#xD;
      since last deployment; time since earliest documented mTBI; time since target,&#xD;
      service-related, mTBI; and total number of mTBIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Within the same final model above, a contrast will be used to test (1) those&#xD;
      with co-occurring target, service-related, mTBI and PTSD vs. PTSD only and (2) those with&#xD;
      co-occurring target, service-related, mTBI and PTSD vs. target, service-related, mTBI only.&#xD;
