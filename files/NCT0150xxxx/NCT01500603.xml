      Background: Periurethral Pro-ACT balloons and retrourethral AdvanceXP(TM) male sling have&#xD;
      been presented as efficient treatments for management of stress urinary incontinence (SUI)&#xD;
      following radical prostatectomy (RP), but no comparative study of these two techniques has&#xD;
      been published. The investigators aims were to compare the efficacy of the two devices and&#xD;
      provide data about their cost effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The study is based on the superiority hypothesis that AdvanceXP male slings is&#xD;
      more efficacious than Pro-ACT balloons at one year follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of the&#xD;
      AdvanceXP retrourethral male sling and periurethral Pro-ACT balloons management of SUI after&#xD;
      RP at one year follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comprehensive comparative medical evaluation of the two devices in terms of efficacy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete evaluation of the side effects of the two techniques&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of the quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of patient satisfaction&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cost-effectiveness study of the device (total cost over one year of each of the two&#xD;
           techniques, differential cost-effectiveness ratio (cost adjusted by QALY), differential&#xD;
           cost-effectiveness ratio in terms adjusted to success rate, recommendations that can be&#xD;
           made for assessing the potential coverage by the French healthcare system) Population:&#xD;
           Patients with history of RP without cancer recurrence, presenting pure SUI on&#xD;
           urodynamics (without detrusor overactivity), of mild to moderate degree (24hour pad-test&#xD;
           &lt; 300g).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This is a prospective, randomized, multicentric (9 tertiary reference centers),&#xD;
      comparative trial of the two devices (with a superiority hypothesis). The total number of&#xD;
      subjects required is 240 and inclusion period is 12 months. Follow-up consists in 4 visits at&#xD;
      1, 3, 6 and 12 months, with data collection (pad use, uroflowmetry, quality of life validated&#xD;
      questionnaires ICIQ-SF and EQ-5D, 24-hr pad test, patient satisfaction with PGI-I and report&#xD;
      of any secondary effect). Statistical evaluation is carried out at the end of the follow-up,&#xD;
      in intent to treat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main criterion:failure of the treatment, defined by reduction of less than 50% of&#xD;
      incontinence on 24-hr pad test, explantation of the device or implantation of a new surgical&#xD;
      device for SUI.&#xD;
&#xD;

      Background: Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is a common adverse event of radical&#xD;
      prostatectomy (RP) for localized prostate cancer and can dramatically impact quality of life.&#xD;
      Management of SUI after RP is based on conservative measures and pelvic floor muscle&#xD;
      training. In case of failure of this first line therapy, surgical treatment is required. In&#xD;
      recent years, periurethral Pro-ACT balloons and retrourethral AdvanceXP male sling have been&#xD;
      proven to be efficient to manage SUI after RP in case of mild to moderate symptoms. Pro-ACT&#xD;
      balloons are placed under general anesthesia via a perineal approach, laterally to the&#xD;
      membranous urethra under the bladder neck. This device results in an external compression of&#xD;
      the urethra. Further adjustment of the compression is possible under local anesthesia since&#xD;
      the balloons are linked to a subcutaneous titanium port. AdvanceXP male sling is placed under&#xD;
      general anesthesia via a perineal approach, by transobturator route, and results in a&#xD;
      suspension of the membranous urethra relocating the bladder neck. If multiple reports have&#xD;
      claimed for the efficacy of these two devices, they have never been compared in a prospective&#xD;
      comparative trial. Our aims were to compare the efficacy of the two devices and provide data&#xD;
      about their cost effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The study is based on the superiority hypothesis that Advance male slings is more&#xD;
      efficacious than Pro-ACT balloons at one year follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of the Advance retrourethral&#xD;
      male sling and periurethral Pro-ACT balloons for post-prostatectomy stress urinary&#xD;
      incontinence (SUI) management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this work are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comprehensive medical evaluation of these two emerging devices in terms of efficiency&#xD;
           using the usual criteria in the field of urinary incontinence&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete evaluation of the side effects of the two techniques&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of the quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cost-effectiveness study of the device (Total cost over one year of each of the two&#xD;
           techniques, differential cost-effectiveness ratio (cost adjusted by QALY), differential&#xD;
           cost-effectiveness ratio in terms adjusted to success rate, recommendations that can be&#xD;
           made for assessing the potential coverage by the French healthcare system&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: The study concerns patients presenting SUI following radical prostatectomy for&#xD;
      prostate cancer. Patients must be older than 18, without cancer recurrence, and must present&#xD;
      pure SUI on urodynamics (without detrusor overactivity), and mild to moderate incontinence&#xD;
      (24hour pad-test &lt; 300g). Every patient showing urethral stricture at preoperative cystoscopy&#xD;
      is excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This is a prospective, randomized, multicentric (9 tertiary reference centers),&#xD;
      comparative trial of the two devices (with a superiority hypothesis). The study begins with a&#xD;
      12 months inclusion period. The total number of subjects required is 240. At the end of the&#xD;
      inclusion process, a randomization in two arms is carried out. Follow-up consists in 4 visits&#xD;
      at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months, with data collection (pad use, uroflowmetry, quality of life&#xD;
      validated questionnaires ICIQ-SF and EQ-5D, 24-hr pad test, patient satisfaction with PGI-I&#xD;
      and report of any secondary effect). Statistical evaluation is carried out at the end of the&#xD;
      follow-up, in intent to treat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main criterion of the study is failure of the treatment, defined by reduction of less&#xD;
      than 50% of incontinence on 24-hr pad test, explantation of the device or implantation of a&#xD;
      new surgical device for SUI management in the year after operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary criteria are focused on efficacy and tolerance and evaluated during follow-up at 1,&#xD;
      3, 6 and 12 months on the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  pad usage per day&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  quantitative reduction of the 24hr-pad test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  complications (infection, erosion, hematoma, acute urinary retention)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  number of re-interventions or re-admissions during follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  quality of life measured by the ICIQ-SF questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patient satisfaction by the PGI-I questionnaire The statistical evaluation on the main&#xD;
           criterion will be carried out by the chi-square test. Variables with a known predictive&#xD;
           value on efficiency (radiation therapy, severity of incontinence) will be studied by&#xD;
           logistic regression then multivariate analysis. The results will be adjusted on the&#xD;
           centers (multicentric study). The quantitative variables will be compared by&#xD;
           Mann-Whitney test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Economic evaluation: The economic evaluation will be carried out according to the following&#xD;
      manner:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A study of the total cost over one year of each device, based on the data collected&#xD;
           during the clinical trial and including all the events that required medical care&#xD;
           (visits, complications, reinterventions, readmissions), but also the cost of pads (not&#xD;
           supported by healthcare system, and only supported by the patient).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  From this study led on cost and of the collection of quality of life data, the cost of&#xD;
           each device will be adjusted to quality of life (QALY evaluation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A cost effectiveness study will also be lead, by adjusting cost to success rate of each&#xD;
           technique&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proposals will be made to state at which level the two devices should be covered by the&#xD;
           healthcare system.&#xD;
