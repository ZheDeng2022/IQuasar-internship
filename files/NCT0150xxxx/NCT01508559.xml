    <textblock>
      The treatment of HIV and the tests performed for HIV care have changed over the last 20 years&#xD;
      but improvement of management of HIV-infected subjects is still warranted. The investigators&#xD;
      would like to collect and analyse clinical information obtained from subjects who are between&#xD;
      18 and 50 years of age. The investigators will look at routine clinic information such as&#xD;
      blood pressure, recent blood test results and clinical history. The investigators will then&#xD;
      assess cognitive (brain) function by talking and/or written tests. These tests will include&#xD;
      tests for memory, depression and anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of those who are identified as having problems with their brain function in this way will&#xD;
      be offered onward referral for further assessment as appropriate. Those taking part will be&#xD;
      offered a follow up visit at 24-48 weeks after the first assessment to see if there are any&#xD;
      changes. This will allow us to understand how brain problems develop, get worse, or get&#xD;
      better over time. No genetic research will be done. Depression is a mental health condition&#xD;
      that can be characterized by negative feelings, a generally low mood, or problems with eating&#xD;
      and sleeping normally. Anxiety is also a mental health condition where a person can feel&#xD;
      general anxiousness or fear of specific situations, or, in more serious cases, can have panic&#xD;
      attacks. Impaired brain function is a condition of the nervous system or brain where the&#xD;
      brain does not function as well as it normally should, and can include symptoms such as&#xD;
      forgetfulness, doing everyday tasks more slowly or becoming disorientated to the time of day&#xD;
      or the place one is in.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, the investigators will also collect data from medical records, including (and&#xD;
      if known)social and educational-related data, HIV infection-related data (e.g. date of&#xD;
      diagnosis, blood test results), relevant medical history (e.g. previous psychiatric&#xD;
      conditions) and medication used (e.g. date started, the drugs used).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information the investigators will get from this study will be used to inform healthcare&#xD;
      providers (doctor, nurse, health advisor, psychologist) on whether it is necessary to&#xD;
      routinely assess HIV infected patients for the presence of anxiety/depression and impaired&#xD;
      brain function. The investigators will also get information on whether the treatments used&#xD;
      for HIV infection make a difference to how commonly these conditions occur in patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to examine neurocognitive functioning in HIV infected men who have&#xD;
      sex with men (MSMs). We have limited our study to this group in order to better study other&#xD;
      shared risk factors (hepatitis coinfection, recreational drug use). Given ongoing work in an&#xD;
      older cohort our aim is to study neurocognitive impairment in younger subjects (18-49 years).&#xD;
      There are two parts to this study. The first is a cross sectional pilot (MSM Neurocog-1)&#xD;
      looking at neurocognitive function in HIV infected and HIV uninfected MSMs. The second plan&#xD;
      is for a prospective 48 week cohort study 24-48 week study (MSM Neurocog-2) following&#xD;
      neurocognitive function in HIV infected subjects and a group of HIV uninfected controls over&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The shift in HIV care to that of a chronic, manageable condition has transferred focus to&#xD;
      long-term morbidities and drug toxicities. One such area in which there is renewed interest&#xD;
      is the prevalence and relevance of neurocognitive impairment, as well as the significance of&#xD;
      compartmentalised virus in the CSF as compared to blood. Controlled, comparative data are&#xD;
      lacking - many of the cross-sectional studies to date have not controlled for important&#xD;
      confounders such as recreational and injecting drug use, current or prior co-infections or&#xD;
      co-morbidities. Where this has happened, researchers generally use general population&#xD;
      controls that may differ markedly from HIV-infected individuals in terms of lifestyle and&#xD;
      demographic factors. In addition the paucity of longitudinal data means it is unclear whether&#xD;
      an individual with normal neurocognitive function pre-ART will develop impairment later or if&#xD;
      subjects with evidence of impairment can expect improvement or normalisation over time; these&#xD;
      issues are highly important for clinical management and patient counselling. There is no&#xD;
      consensus on which surrogate markers, if any, are important in terms of diagnosing,&#xD;
      monitoring and/or predicting neurocognitive impairment. Studies measuring correlation between&#xD;
      neurocognitive performance and neuronal markers of inflammation have been conflicting.&#xD;
