      The investigators would like to conduct a double blind placebo-controlled prospective study&#xD;
      to show the impact of a treatment combining a specific cognitive rehabilitation program and&#xD;
      acetylcholinesterase inhibitors on executive function of young patients 3 months after a&#xD;
      first symptomatic stroke. The secondary objectives will be to assess cognitive changes&#xD;
      performance (executive but also non trained functions such as memory) before and after&#xD;
      treatments and treatment effect on activity of daily living and on quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to show the impact of this combined treatment on brain&#xD;
      activation maps in VCI-ND patients in the post-acute phase (3 months) after a stroke.&#xD;
      Treatment effect will be assessed by functional MRI (fMRI) while patients will be performing&#xD;
      a specific executive task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the specific rehabilitation associated with&#xD;
      acetylcholinestrase inhibitors treatment will focalize cerebral activation observed in fMRI,&#xD;
      improve executive functions specifically, improve non trained cognitive functions&#xD;
      (generalization effect).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies, including the investigators', have shown that neuropsychological alteration&#xD;
      is frequent and underestimated after stroke (Vascular Cognitive Impairment (VCI). VCI-No&#xD;
      Dementia (VCI-ND) is characterized by a mild cognitive alteration in relation to a&#xD;
      cerebrovascular lesion, diagnosed by a neuropsychological assessment, and without major&#xD;
      alteration in the activities of daily living, but that can represent an issue in return to&#xD;
      work for young patients. Some studies demonstrated that cognitive rehabilitation or&#xD;
      pharmacological intervention may to improve patients' cognition and social functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that a combination of pharmacological and cognitive&#xD;
      rehabilitation treatments is beneficial on executive but also other cognitive function in&#xD;
      VCI-ND patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore the investigators would like to conduct a double blind placebo-controlled&#xD;
      prospective study to show the impact of a treatment combining a specific cognitive&#xD;
      rehabilitation program and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors on executive function of young&#xD;
      patients 3 months after a first symptomatic stroke. The secondary objectives will be to&#xD;
      assess cognitive changes performance (executive but also non trained functions such as&#xD;
      memory) before and after treatments and treatment effect on activity of daily living and on&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to show the impact of this combined treatment on brain&#xD;
      activation maps in VCI-ND patients in the post-acute phase (3 months) after a stroke.&#xD;
      Treatment effect will be assessed by functional MRI (fMRI) while patients will be performing&#xD;
      a specific executive task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the specific rehabilitation associated with&#xD;
      acetylcholinestrase inhibitors treatment will focalize cerebral activation observed in fMRI,&#xD;
      improve executive functions specifically, improve non trained cognitive functions&#xD;
