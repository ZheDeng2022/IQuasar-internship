      The purpose of this research study is to learn about parents' experiences following diagnosis&#xD;
      of a fetal/neonatal Congenital Heart Defect (CHD). Nurses, physicians, and other health-care&#xD;
      clinicians will benefit from an improved understanding of what the diagnosis means to parents&#xD;
      and what they expect concerning the infant, being a parent, and caregiving tasks and&#xD;
      responsibilities. The investigators expect that the knowledge gained will increase&#xD;
      clinicians' ability to respond to parents' needs.&#xD;

      Parental mental health status is linked to the development and quality of caregiving, as well&#xD;
      as physiological and psychosocial outcomes for the infant/child with a heart defect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an evolving population of parents with most challenged prenatally with a fetal&#xD;
      diagnosis and later as caregivers for medically complex infants. Parents with pre- and&#xD;
      postnatally diagnosed infants are at risk for sub-optimal mental health. Parents' experiences&#xD;
      and needs differ by timing of diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several gaps in the literature exist. First, advances in technology raise questions about how&#xD;
      becoming a caregiver is experienced considering the timing of the diagnosis. Second, little&#xD;
      is known about how the timing of the diagnosis could influence parents' mental health status&#xD;
      and caregiving after diagnosis. Finally, more study is needed to identify the type, timing&#xD;
      and duration of intervention to support these parents as caregivers and optimize their&#xD;
      infants' health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected for this study included demographic and health information (from parents and&#xD;
      infant health records), measures of distress (symptoms of depression, anxiety and trauma),&#xD;
      and interviews. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with parents in person in the&#xD;
      hospital and home settings. Interviews with each couple in the prenatally diagnosed group&#xD;
      were conducted once during the third trimester of pregnancy and once within 12 weeks after&#xD;
      birth. Interviews with each couple or mother in the postnatally diagnosed group were&#xD;
      conducted once within 12 weeks after birth. Interviews lasted 1-3 hours, were audio-recorded&#xD;
      and transcribed verbatim for analysis. Field notes were also written and audio recorded for&#xD;
      use in analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Directed content analysis has been used to describe parents' experiences and caregiving&#xD;
      motivations in relation to parental distress and severity of infant illness. Analysis of data&#xD;
      is ongoing. Additional analyses are expected to further improve knowledge on the differing&#xD;
      needs of parents of pre- and postnatally diagnosed infants, as well as parents' experiences&#xD;
      and caregiving motivations in the context of discharge from tertiary care.&#xD;

        In this year-long study, 12 to 16 families (mothers and fathers) will be recruited-6 to 8&#xD;
        of the families from the fetal diagnosis clinic at either Meriter Hospital or Children's&#xD;
        Hospital of Wisconsin and 6 to 8 families whose infant is diagnosed soon after birth with a&#xD;
        complex CHD at either Meriter Hospital or Children's Hospital of Wisconsin.&#xD;
