      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart failure is the final consequence of various heart disease and is also the leading cause&#xD;
      of mortality worldwide. Diastolic dysfunction refers to an abnormality of diastolic&#xD;
      distensibility, filling, or relaxation of the left ventricle. Patients with hypertensive left&#xD;
      ventricular hypertrophy and an echocardiogram showing a normal ejection fraction and abnormal&#xD;
      left ventricular filling can be said to have diastolic dysfunction. If pulmonary edema or&#xD;
      effort dyspnea developed in such a patient. The term diastolic heart failure would be&#xD;
      appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pathology leading to diastolic heart failure include: impaired relaxation, increased passive&#xD;
      stiffness, endocardial and pericardial disorders, microvascular flow and neurohormonal&#xD;
      regulation. Among them, the association of pro-inflammatory system and diastolic dysfunction&#xD;
      are already established. The investigators therefore hypothesized that the change of serum&#xD;
      inflammatory markers might be associated with the change of left ventricular diastolic&#xD;
      function and the investigators thus conducted a randomized case-control trial with this&#xD;
      regard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method and materials&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a case-control randomized study. The definition of left ventricular diastolic&#xD;
      function is according to Guideline from the ACC and AHA. The investigators will evaluate left&#xD;
      ventricular diastolic function noninvasively by echocardiography before and after the&#xD;
      intervention. Exclusion criteria include coronary artery disease, significant valvular heart&#xD;
      disease, cardiomyopathy, pericardial disease and renal insufficiency. The investigators would&#xD;
      like to enroll 50 cases and the same numbers of the controls. The inclusion criteria are&#xD;
      subjects who underwent peritoneal dialysis at the investigators hospital for more than 6&#xD;
      months with higher pro-inflammation serum cytokine levels (C-reactive protein &gt; 0.2mg/dL).&#xD;
      Atorvastatin (40mg/day) would be given to those who were allocated to the intervention group.&#xD;
      The investigators will than follow up cardiac diastolic function by echocardiography and also&#xD;
      the change of serum markers. The investigators would also genotype the&#xD;
      inflammation-associated genes and their promoter region and find the association between&#xD;
      genetic polymorphisms and the treatment effects of statins.&#xD;

      We will evaluate left ventricular diastolic function noninvasively by echocardiography before&#xD;
      and after the intervention. Exclusion criteria include coronary artery disease, significant&#xD;
      valvular heart disease, cardiomyopathy, pericardial disease and renal insufficiency. We would&#xD;
      like to enroll 50 cases and the same numbers of the controls. The inclusion criteria are&#xD;
      subjects who underwent peritoneal dialysis at our hospital for more than 6 months with higher&#xD;
      pro-inflammation serum cytokine levels (C-reactive protein &gt; 0.2mg/dL). Atorvastatin&#xD;
      (40mg/day) would be given to those who were allocated to the intervention group. We will than&#xD;
      follow up cardiac diastolic function by echocardiography and also the change of serum&#xD;
      markers. We would also genotype the inflammation-associated genes and their promoter region&#xD;
      and find the association between genetic polymorphisms and the treatment effects of statins.&#xD;
