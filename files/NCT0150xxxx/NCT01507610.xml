      The purpose of this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the single-dose pharmacokinetics (PK) of intranasal administration of 20 mg&#xD;
           OPTINOSE SUMATRIPTAN with 20 mg IMITREX® (sumatriptan) Nasal Spray, 100 mg IMITREX®&#xD;
           (sumatriptan) Oral Tablet, and 6 mg IMITREX® (sumatriptan) Subcutaneous Injection, in&#xD;
           healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the relative bioavailability of single-dose intranasal administration of 20&#xD;
           mg OPTINOSE SUMATRIPTAN, 20 mg IMITREX® (sumatriptan) Nasal Spray, and 100 mg IMITREX®&#xD;
           (sumatriptan) Oral Tablet compared to a single-dose of 6 mg IMITREX® (sumatriptan)&#xD;
