      The incidence of type 2 Diabetes Mellitus is increasing at an alarming rate worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in patients with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, increasing amount of evidence suggests that vitamin D may influence various&#xD;
      nonskeletal medical conditions, including cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes,&#xD;
      cancer, autoimmune disorders and more. The purpose of this trial is to investigate the effect&#xD;
      of vitamin D supplementation on 24 hours blood pressure monitoring, arterial stiffness,&#xD;
      oxidative stress and inflammation in vitamin D deficient diabetic patients.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of type 2 Diabetes Mellitus is increasing at an alarming rate worldwide, with&#xD;
      more than 1 million new cases per year diagnosed in the United States alone. [1] Diabetes is&#xD;
      the fifth leading cause of death in the United States, and it is also a major cause of&#xD;
      significant morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in patients with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk of Cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in type 2 diabetic patients is more than&#xD;
      double compared with that in age-matched subjects. [2] Therefore, reducing cardiovascular&#xD;
      risk in diabetic patients is of great importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol), the most powerful form of vitamin D, is synthesized in the skin&#xD;
      from 7-dehydrocholesterol by action of sunlight (ultraviolet B radiation). Vitamin D3 is&#xD;
      biologically inert. In the hepatic parenchyma, vitamin D3 is converted to 25-hydroxyvitamin&#xD;
      D3 (25OHD3) and must be converted to the active hormone 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D&#xD;
      (calcitriol). 25OHD is the most plentiful and stable metabolite of vitamin D. As such, the&#xD;
      25OHD level in the serum is the best indicator of vitamin D level. [3]&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major and most well known function of Vitamin D is to maintain calcium and phosphorus&#xD;
      homeostasis and promote bone mineralization. It is well understood that vitamin D deficiency&#xD;
      leads to osteomalacia and osteoporosis in adults. [4]&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, recently, increasing amount of evidence suggests that vitamin D may also influence&#xD;
      various nonskeletal medical conditions, including cardiovascular disease, hypertension,&#xD;
      diabetes, cancer, autoimmune disorders and more [4, 5] An evolving data indicates that&#xD;
      vitamin D deficiency is much more prevalent than previously recognized. In the United States,&#xD;
      as well as in other parts of the world, the mean population serum 25OHD levels have decreased&#xD;
      in the last decade. The best example of this drop comes from the National Health and&#xD;
      Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) population showing near doubling in the number of&#xD;
      subjects in the American population from 1994 to 2004 with 25OHD levels less than 30&#xD;
      ng/ml.[6]&#xD;
&#xD;
      The possible explanations for this dramatic decrease in vitamin D level are: downward in milk&#xD;
      consumption, upward in sun protection and upward in obesity. [7]&#xD;
&#xD;
      All cause and cardiovascular mortality:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NHANES III database clearly shows an increase in adjusted all cause mortality as the&#xD;
      serum 25OHD level falls to less than 30 ng/ml, especially in woman, and peak protection from&#xD;
      death with a 25OHD level in the 35-40 ng/ml range. The prevalence of coronary artery disease,&#xD;
      heart failure, and peripheral artery disease is significantly increased in a stepwise fashion&#xD;
      as the serum 25OHD level drops to less than 30 and then 20 ng/ml (insufficiency and&#xD;
      deficiency, respectively). [8]&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent meta-analysis of 18 trials comprising 57,311 randomly assigned participants, found&#xD;
      that vitamin D supplementation &gt;500 IU/day reduced all cause mortality by 7%, in part by&#xD;
      decreasing CV deaths.[9] Deficient or insufficient serum 25(OH) D levels have been documented&#xD;
      in patients with myocardial infarction .[10] A correlation between vitamin D deficiency and&#xD;
      subsequent major adverse CV events was found among the 1739 Framingham Offspring Study&#xD;
      participants who were free of CV disease at baseline. In this prospective observational&#xD;
      study, 25(OH) D levels were measured at baseline and subjects were followed up for a mean of&#xD;
      5.4 years. The rate of a composite CV end point (fatal or nonfatal MI, ischemia, stroke, or&#xD;
      heart failure) was 53% to 80% higher in people with low vitamin D levels.[11]&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reason for this association between all cause mortality, CVD and vitamin D&#xD;
      insufficiency/deficiency is unclear. It is also unclear whether vitamin D supplementation&#xD;
      will normalize the CVD risk in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent systemic review Wang et al found no completed trials that have tested the effect&#xD;
      of vitamin D and calcium supplementation on CVD as the primary end point. [12]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin D and diabetes Inspection of the recent vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency&#xD;
      epidemiological literature has brought to light the striking inverse correlation of&#xD;
      the25OHDlevel not only to cardiovascular disease but also to essentially all of the elements&#xD;
      of the human metabolic syndrome: hypertension; obesity; insulin resistance and glucose&#xD;
      Intolerance [3] Likewise, in cross sectional studies, inverse associations between serum&#xD;
      25(OH) D and presence of type 2 diabetes have been reported in a variety of cohorts. [13-15]&#xD;
&#xD;
      One example is the analysis of data from participants who attended the morning examination of&#xD;
      the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988-1994) that showed an inverse&#xD;
      association between vitamin D status and diabetes.[13]&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observations regarding the high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among type 2 DM&#xD;
      patients do not establish causative relationship between the two.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the women's Health Study, an intake of 511 IU/d of vitamin D or more was associated with&#xD;
      lower risk of incidence type 2 DM compared with low intake [16]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin D and Arterial stiffness Augmentation pressure, reflecting the pulsatile component of&#xD;
      blood pressure and thus arterial stiffness, is a well-known risk factor for cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease and outcome.[17-21] Augmentation index (AIx), a non invasive measure of arterial&#xD;
      stiffness, has been shown to predict coronary artery disease (CAD) in the general population&#xD;
      and in patients with type 2 diabetes [20, 22, 23] The differential effects on arterial&#xD;
      stiffness may be responsible for the different impact of diverse antihypertensive&#xD;
      drug/treatments on CAD.[21] Different drugs have been proved to improve arterial stiffness.&#xD;
      One example is the beneficial effect of statins on AIx, a result that is independent of their&#xD;
      cholesterol lowering effect. [24] Andrade et al found that Lower 1,25-OH2D3 levels were&#xD;
      associated with higher Aix in 131 outpatients identified from individual cardiac or kidney&#xD;
      disease clinics. [25] Vitamin D regulates the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in experimental&#xD;
      animals. Recently data in humans suggest that low plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels may&#xD;
      result in upregulation of the RAS in otherwise healthy humans. [26] No studies to date&#xD;
      examined the effect of vitamin D supplementation on blood pressure and arterial stiffness as&#xD;
      primary end point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this trial is to investigate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on 24&#xD;
      hours blood pressure monitoring, arterial stiffness, oxidative stress and inflammation in&#xD;
      vitamin D deficient diabetic patients.&#xD;
