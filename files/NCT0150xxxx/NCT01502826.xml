    <textblock>
      Childhood obesity is increasing at a fast pace, together with its complications. The aim of&#xD;
      the present study is to assess several candidate triggering agents, mechanisms and&#xD;
      intermediate phenotypes of atherosclerosis during the post-prandial phase in the obese&#xD;
      insulin-resistant child/adolescent.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Some of earlier outlines of the relationships between enlarged fat mass and insulin&#xD;
      resistance have not been proven experimentally in man. For instance, most of the&#xD;
      relationships shown in humans between cytokines and insulin sensitivity are correlational&#xD;
      observations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the obese child, fatty liver is quite prevalent and is more closely associated than other&#xD;
      fat depots to insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, high blood pressure and to high levels of&#xD;
      inflammation markers. The entire picture, therefore, is consistent with an accelerated drive&#xD;
      to atherosclerosis in the obese child/adolescent. Indeed, several reports have demonstrated&#xD;
      that intermediate phenotypes of atherosclerosis can be detected in the obese child.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the post-prandial phase is thought to play a role of its own in atherogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that in the obese insulin-resistant child mechanisms of&#xD;
      atherogenesis, such as hyperlipemia, oxidant stress and sub-inflammation, are activated in&#xD;
      the post-prandial phase resulting in impairments of vascular function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parameters under study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Candidate triggering agents&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Post-prandial glucose&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Post-prandial hyperlipemia&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Post-prandial small dense LDL&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Post-prandial insulin&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Candidate mechanisms&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Complement activation&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  C3&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Inflammation&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  TNF-alpha&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Interleukin-6 (IL-6)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Interleukin-10 (IL-10)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  C-reactive protein (CRP)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Oxidant Stress&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Urinary iso-PGF2-alpha&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Intermediate Phenotypes&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT) (only at baseline)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Endothelial Function (flow-mediated vasodilation) (FMD)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Arterial Stiffness (pulse-wave velocity) (PWV)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental protocol Subjects will arrive at the Division of Endocrinology and Metabolic&#xD;
      Diseases of the Verona City Hospital at 0800 h after an overnight fast. Weight, height, waist&#xD;
      circumference and blood pressure will be measured. During the entire study subjects will be&#xD;
      lying in bed in a quiet, temperature controlled (22 °C) room. A Teflon venous catheter will&#xD;
      be inserted into an antecubital vein for blood sampling and will be kept patent with a normal&#xD;
      saline slow-drip infusion. Baseline state will be considered attained after at least 20&#xD;
      minutes of rest in bed following vein puncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects must have been on no drugs known to interfere with vascular function for at least 2&#xD;
      weeks and will be asked to refrain from caffeine containing beverages for at least 24 hours&#xD;
      before study. Systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure and&#xD;
      heart rate will be monitored at time intervals with Cardiocap II (Datex, Finland) throughout&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carotid-femoral PWV will be assessed using Complior (Colson, Garges les Genosse, France) .&#xD;
      Carotid artery IMT will be assessed by high resolution US color-doppler scan. Then,&#xD;
      flow-mediated endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the nondominant common femoral artery&#xD;
      will be assessed by high resolution echo-doppler (Esaote Biomedica AU6, Genova, Italy), with&#xD;
      a 10 MHz linear vascular probe with axial resolution of 0.01 mm. Baseline diameter and blood&#xD;
      flow velocity, a proxy of shear stress, will be assessed at least in triplicate. After this,&#xD;
      a sphygmomanometric cuff will be put under the knee and inflated 50 mm Hg higher than&#xD;
      systolic blood pressure and maintained for 5'. Vessel diameter and flow velocity will be&#xD;
      measured at time 0.5', 2', 4', 6', and 8' after deflating the cuff, according to&#xD;
      investigators' well established protocol . Under these conditions, when the cuff is deflated&#xD;
      postischemic hyperemia will take place in the tissues which are distal to the&#xD;
      sphygmomanometric cuff. This hyperemia will induced an increase in blood flow velocity of the&#xD;
      common femoral artery, which is located proximally to the cuff. The increase in flow&#xD;
      velocity, and the ensuing increase in shear stress, elicit an endothelium-dependent&#xD;
      vasodilation. It has been shown that this dilation is NO-dependent. A global quantitative&#xD;
      index of flow-dependent vasodilation will be obtained by calculating the area under the curve&#xD;
      of change in vessel diameter as a function of time (8 min of observation), expressed both as&#xD;
      absolute values and as percent changes over the baseline vessel diameter. In investigators'&#xD;
      hands, the between-day coefficient of variation of this technique (n=15, covering a wide&#xD;
      range of vascular response) is 23.0±3.8%. Endothelium-independent vasodilation will not be&#xD;
      evaluated because glyceryl-trinitrate administration for research purpose is deemed ethically&#xD;
      unjustifiable in children by the local Institutional Ethical Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In investigators' current experience (n=42 severely obese children), average FMD after an&#xD;
      overnight fast is 1.40±0.91% per 8 minutes (mean±SD), thereby leaving substantial room to&#xD;
      show dynamic changes. In these severely obese children these investigators found no&#xD;
      correlation between FMD and BMI. An ad hoc mechanical US probe holder will be employed in the&#xD;
      present paired studies, with the goal to help increasing reproducibility of the technique.&#xD;
      Furthermore, a specific automatic contour tracking technique for the automatic calculation of&#xD;
      the changes in arterial diameter will be used to minimize the operator dependency of this&#xD;
      method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline (-10 min and 0') blood samples will be collected to measure glucose, insulin,&#xD;
      C-peptide, standard lipid profile (total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides),&#xD;
      oxidized-LDL, adiponectin, leptin, C3, TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-10, and CRP by micro-methods to&#xD;
      limit blood loss. A separate sample will be collected to measure LDL and HDL subfractions.&#xD;
      Baseline urines will be collected to measure iso-PGF2-alpha, a product derived from&#xD;
      nonenzymatic lipid peroxidation, catalyzed by oxygen free radicals on cell membranes and LDL&#xD;
      particles (43).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At time 0', subjects will ingest a mixed liquid meal (Ensure Plus, 1.5 kcal/cc) of known&#xD;
      caloric content (300 kcal per m2 of body surface area) and composition (53.8% carbohydrates,&#xD;
      29.5% lipids, 16.7% proteins) over 10 minutes. Glucose, insulin and C-peptide will be&#xD;
      measured at +15', +30', +45', +60', +90', +120', +150', +180', +210', +240' and +300'.&#xD;
      Standard lipids and PWV will be measured at +60', +120', +180', +240' and +300'. Adiponectin,&#xD;
      leptin, C3, TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-10, CRP and LDL and HDL subfractions will be measured at&#xD;
      +180' and +300'. At time +180' assessment of FMD will be repeated. At the end of the meal&#xD;
      test urines will be collected to assess 8-iso-PGF2-alpha.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be quickly spun at 1500 g at +4 °C, plasma/serum will be collected and&#xD;
      stored at -80° C. Urine samples will be stored at -80° C. Total blood loss will be kept below&#xD;
      100 cc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analytical Methods Except for LDL/HDL subfraction assessment and urine PGF2alpha, methods&#xD;
      specifically optimized to use tiny amounts of plasma/serum will be used to minimize blood&#xD;
      loss. Glucose will be measured at bedside with a Yellow Spring Glucose Analyzer by the&#xD;
      glucose oxidase method. C-peptide and insulin will be measured by in-house ELISA&#xD;
      micro-methods. Total and HDL cholesterol and total triglycerides will be assessed by standard&#xD;
      in-house enzymatic micro-methods. Adiponectin, leptin, C3, TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-10, CRP will&#xD;
      be assessed by in-house immunometric micro methods. 8-Iso-PGF2alpha will be assessed by an&#xD;
      immunometric assay after extraction from urines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LDL/HDL subfractions will be measured in the laboratory of prof. Alberto Zambon, at&#xD;
      University of Padua School of Medicine. Briefly, after creating a discontinuous salt density&#xD;
      gradient in an ultracentrifuge tube, the samples will be centrifuged at 65,000 rpm for 90 min&#xD;
      at 10°C in a Sorvall TV-865B vertical rotor. Thirty-eight 0.45-ml fractions are then&#xD;
      collected from the bottom of the centrifuge tube. Cholesterol is measured in each fraction.&#xD;
      The relative flotation rate (Rf), which characterizes LDL peak buoyancy and is a measure of&#xD;
      LDL size/density, is obtained by dividing the fraction number containing the LDL cholesterol&#xD;
      peak by the total number of fractions collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of beta-cell function&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beta-cell function will be evaluated by analyzing the glucose and C-peptide curves during the&#xD;
      mixed meal test, according to the general strategy proposed by several laboratories with some&#xD;
      slight modifications. Briefly, insulin secretion is the sum of three components:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. basal (postabsorptive) insulin secretion rates;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. insulin secretion in response to the rate of increase in plasma glucose (&quot;dynamic&quot; or&#xD;
           &quot;derivative&quot; secretion component);&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. insulin secretion in response to the actual glucose levels above the postabsorptive&#xD;
           glucose concentration (&quot;static&quot; or &quot;proportional&quot; secretion component).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A complete description of the modeling strategy can be found in investigators' earlier&#xD;
      publications. Parameters will be estimated by implementing this minimal model of C-peptide&#xD;
      secretion in the SAAM 1.1.2 software (SAAM Institute, Seattle, WA). Numerical values of the&#xD;
      unknown parameters will be estimated by using nonlinear least squares.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weights are chosen optimally, i.e., equal to the inverse of the variance of the measurement&#xD;
      errors, which are assumed to be additive, uncorrelated, with zero mean, and a constant&#xD;
      coefficient of variation (CV) of 8%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This analysis will provide the hormonal scenario in which the postprandial atherogenetic&#xD;
      processes take place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Data will be summarized as means±SEM. The size of the sample (n=20 in&#xD;
      each group) has been selected with the aim of having 80% chance of attaining statistical&#xD;
      significance for differences of 20-40% (the minimum detectable difference varies from&#xD;
      variable to variable under study). The general estimating equation procedure (GEE) will be&#xD;
      used to run 2-way ANOVA for repeated measures and to adjust for covariates, if needed.&#xD;
      Gaussian distribution will be tested in all variables, and, if statistically significant&#xD;
      deviations from normality are found, logarithmic (or other) transformation will be applied.&#xD;
      Correlations will be sought by the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Statistical&#xD;
      significance will be declared at p&lt;0.05. Statistical analyses will be performed using SPSS&#xD;
      12.0 (or higher) for MacOS X.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reaching the goals of the present research project will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. enlarge the knowledge on the relationship between childhood obesity, inflammation,&#xD;
           insulin resistance and vascular dysfunction;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. elucidate whether postprandial hyperlipemia, postprandial inflammation and/or&#xD;
           postprandial oxidant stress are associated to intermediate phenotypes of atherosclerosis&#xD;
           in the obese child/adolescent;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. establish potential novel targets of prevention of obesity complications in the&#xD;
           child/adolescent and potentially indicate novel tools for the treatment of obesity&#xD;
           associated disturbances.&#xD;
