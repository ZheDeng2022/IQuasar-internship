    <textblock>
      Outpatient polyp treatment can be performed in a few different ways but generally involves&#xD;
      passing a special type of hysteroscope (3-6 millimetre in diameter) into the womb through&#xD;
      which specifically designed miniature operating instruments are passed to remove the&#xD;
      polyp(s). At present the most commonly used instruments use an electrical cutting edge.&#xD;
      However, a new instrument using a mechanical cutting edge has come to market. In patients&#xD;
      having a general anaesthesia the mechanical cutting instrument has been shown to be easier to&#xD;
      learn, more effective at completely removing polyps and quicker. However, the instrument is&#xD;
      slightly larger, which could potentially cause more discomfort and prolong the procedure in&#xD;
      the outpatient setting. Therefore, the investigators want to compare the electrical and&#xD;
      mechanical instruments for speed, completeness of polyp removal and patient acceptability.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The miniaturisation of hysteroscopes and ancillary instrumentation coupled with enhanced&#xD;
      visualisation has enabled hysteroscopic surgery to be performed in an outpatient setting&#xD;
      without the need for general anaesthesia or inpatient hospital admission. The most common&#xD;
      operative hysteroscopic procedure is endometrial polypectomy and the feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of such approaches has been demonstrated. The procedure involves removing&#xD;
      polyps from the uterine cavity. Over 90% of UK gynaecologists routinely recommend removal of&#xD;
      endometrial polyps following diagnosis with the aim of treating associated symptoms of&#xD;
      abnormal bleeding and retrieving the specimen to exclude malignant or pre-malignant disease.&#xD;
      The investigators have recently completed recruitment to a large, multicentre, randomised&#xD;
      control trial called the Outpatient Polypectomy Trial ('OPT' http://www.opt.bham.ac.uk,&#xD;
      ISRCTN65868569), which has compared treatment settings for the removal of endometrial polyps.&#xD;
      Over 500 women were randomised between outpatient procedures and day-case procedures which&#xD;
      require a general anaesthetic. The analysis regarding relative treatment effectiveness will&#xD;
      be available in late 2012. Interestingly, this trial also recruited women who expressed a&#xD;
      preference for treatment setting. This resulted in an additional 400 women entering the study&#xD;
      of which over 90% had a preference for an outpatient setting (Personal communication Clark&#xD;
      TJ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus outpatient removal of polyps is, feasible, safe and preferred by women. The majority of&#xD;
      gynaecologists performing outpatient procedures, cut polyps away from their attachment to the&#xD;
      uterine wall using a miniature bipolar electrosurgical instrument; VersapointÂ® (Gynecare;&#xD;
      Ethicon Inc., New Jersey, USA). This procedure is carried out under direct hysteroscopic&#xD;
      vision, without the need for routine, potentially painful, dilatation of the cervix. Whilst&#xD;
      the technology is feasible and effective it requires skill and experience in outpatient&#xD;
      hysteroscopic surgery, which many UK gynaecologists lack and this is reflected in the limited&#xD;
      adoption of outpatient procedures in spite of evidence supporting their use. Moreover, even&#xD;
      for the experienced operator, retrieving the removed polyp specimen from the uterine cavity,&#xD;
      to send off for histopathological assessment, can be a challenge due to the small operating&#xD;
      field and the need to negotiate the narrower endocervical canal. Various methods are used to&#xD;
      retrieve specimens and include the use of mechanical instruments (e.g. grasping forceps or&#xD;
      snares) which do not require the cervix to be dilated. However, this approach often fails&#xD;
      because of the fragility of these minute hysteroscopic instruments (diameter 1.2-1.8mm) so&#xD;
      recourse to insertion of larger 'polyp' forceps blindly into the uterine cavity is necessary.&#xD;
      The latter approach requires the use of local injection of anaesthetic into the cervix which&#xD;
      is uncomfortable and dilatation of the cervix with the potential for uterine trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since, completion of recruitment of OPT trial a new technology has become available called&#xD;
      the TRUCLEAR hysteroscopic morcellator (Smith&amp;Nephew, Andover MASS, USA). This technology&#xD;
      incorporates a 4mm disposable mechanical cutting device which simultaneously cuts and&#xD;
      aspirates polyp tissue. The ability to both cut and retrieve polyps avoids the need for&#xD;
      additional instrumentation of the uterine cavity in order to retrieve the detached polyp&#xD;
      specimen i.e. a single insertion of the hysteroscope is required only. The use of mechanical&#xD;
      morcellation may also improve visualisation during surgery by avoidance of bubble formation&#xD;
      or the production of tissue fragments ('chips') associated with the electrosurgical approach.&#xD;
      Thus, this new technology has potential advantages for the patient (acceptability, pain,&#xD;
      infection, safety), the surgeon (speed, feasibility, completeness of the procedure) and&#xD;
      health service (avoidance of second stage procedures under general anaesthetic). However, the&#xD;
      established single use bipolar electrode is smaller than the disposable morcellator cutting&#xD;
      device (1.6mm vs. 2.9mm). Moreover, the bipolar electrode can be used down the operating&#xD;
      channel of a variety of continuous flow hysteroscopes which are longer and smaller in&#xD;
      diameter and in day-to-day use in gynaecological practice in outpatient settings (outer&#xD;
      diameter 4.1mm (Gynecare; Ethicon Inc., New Jersey, USA), 5mm Storz Bettocci hysteroscope&#xD;
      (Karl Storz Endoscopy-America inc., California, USA) or Olympus 5.5mm (Olympus Corporation,&#xD;
      Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, Japan). In contrast, the hysteroscopic morcellator system is larger&#xD;
      (5.6mm outer diameter) and requires acquisition of specific hysteroscopes with an offset&#xD;
      proximal eyepiece to allow the rigid mechanical cutting device to be inserted in direct&#xD;
      alignment with the barrel of the hysteroscope. Thus in an outpatient setting, the bipolar&#xD;
      electrode may have advantages over the larger hysteroscopic morcellator in terms of ease of&#xD;
      uterine instrumentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In view of the development of hysteroscopic morcellation and potential advantages associated&#xD;
      with this innovation in hysteroscopic instrumentation, the investigators believe that there&#xD;
      is an urgent need to undertake a robust health technology assessment. It is timely to perform&#xD;
      an RCT now before the findings of the OPT trial are available (which will recommend&#xD;
      outpatient as opposed to day-case treatment if increased cost-effectiveness is demonstrated).&#xD;
      If the morcellator is considered an easier technology to use by gynaecologists (i.e. less&#xD;
      operator skill required), then there is a danger that it will become widely adopted for&#xD;
      outpatient use without supporting evidence of benefit.&#xD;
