    <textblock>
      Identification and validation of early chronic disease biomarkers in children is of paramount&#xD;
      importance especially in the burgeoning arena of pediatric obesity research. Despite the&#xD;
      presence of risk factors, few obese children develop overt cardiovascular disease (CVD) early&#xD;
      in life. However, because CVD is a cumulative process occurring over time, identifying the&#xD;
      earliest signs in order to intervene sooner may have a large impact on slowing its&#xD;
      progression. Endothelial activation is one of the earliest detectable signs of the beginnings&#xD;
      of CVD. However, accurately quantifying endothelial health in children has proven to be a&#xD;
      major challenge. Direct measures of endothelial cell biology, such as circulating endothelial&#xD;
      cells (CEC) and endothelial microparticles (EMP), have been extensively studied in adults and&#xD;
      are associated with vascular diseases, CVD risk factors, and CVD events. Despite being&#xD;
      well-validated in adults, CEC and EMP have not been formally evaluated as disease biomarkers&#xD;
      in children and adolescents. Pediatric obesity is an ideal condition in which to validate CEC&#xD;
      and EMP as disease biomarkers since adiposity in childhood is associated with CVD, type 2&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus, and premature death, later in life. The investigators primary focus in&#xD;
      this study will be the evaluation of CEC and EMP as biomarkers of CVD risk and whether&#xD;
      substantial changes in weight affect these biomarkers. The investigators propose to evaluate&#xD;
      the change in levels of CEC and EMP in response to substantial weight loss in 32 adolescents&#xD;
      with extreme obesity undergoing elective, clinically-indicated bariatric surgery.&#xD;

      Identification and validation of early chronic disease biomarkers in children is of paramount&#xD;
      importance especially in the burgeoning arena of pediatric obesity research. Despite the&#xD;
      presence of risk factors, few obese children develop overt CVD early in life. However, the&#xD;
      pathologic process of CVD begins in the first two decades of life, particularly in the&#xD;
      presence of obesity. Because CVD is a cumulative process occurring over time, identifying the&#xD;
      earliest signs in order to intervene sooner may have a large impact on slowing its&#xD;
      progression. The challenge is identifying which obese youth have early vascular problems.&#xD;
      Looking to the vascular endothelium for biomarkers of damage is a reasonable approach because&#xD;
      of its prominent role in the origins of atherosclerosis. Endothelial activation is one of the&#xD;
      earliest detectable signs of the beginnings of CVD and predicts subsequent atherosclerosis&#xD;
      and future cardiovascular events. However, accurately quantifying endothelial health in&#xD;
      children has proven to be a major challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brachial artery FMD is the most commonly-used method to quantify endothelial health in&#xD;
      children. However, this technique is not widely applicable, even in the research setting,&#xD;
      because it requires specialized equipment and a highly-trained technician. Moreover, results&#xD;
      can be highly variable (especially across sites) due to operator dependence and&#xD;
      intra-individual fluctuations in endothelial function. More direct measures of endothelial&#xD;
      cell biology, such as CEC and EMP, may offer greater precision in characterizing the state of&#xD;
      the endothelium and may be especially useful as risk-prediction biomarkers in youth since&#xD;
      they are hallmarks of advanced endothelial cell distress, thereby identifying the&#xD;
      highest-risk individuals. CEC and EMP have been extensively studied in adults and are&#xD;
      associated with vascular diseases, CVD risk factors, and CVD events. Despite being&#xD;
      well-validated in adults, CEC and EMP have not been formally evaluated as disease biomarkers&#xD;
      in children and adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pediatric obesity is an ideal condition in which to validate CEC and EMP as disease&#xD;
      biomarkers since adiposity in childhood is associated with CVD, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and&#xD;
      premature death later in life. In particular, extreme obesity is an especially high-risk&#xD;
      condition associated with significant co-morbidities. Our primary focus in this study will be&#xD;
      the evaluation of CEC and EMP as biomarkers of CVD risk, with a goal of validating CEC and&#xD;
      EMP for use as vascular endpoints in pediatric research studies. We propose to evaluate the&#xD;
      change in levels of CEC and EMP in response to substantial weight loss in adolescents with&#xD;
      extreme obesity undergoing elective, clinically-indicated bariatric surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Evaluate the effect of substantial weight loss on levels of CEC and EMP in adolescents&#xD;
      with extreme obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that levels of CEC and EMP will be significantly reduced following elective,&#xD;
      clinically-indicated bariatric surgery in adolescents with extreme obesity. The magnitude of&#xD;
      change in CEC and EMP levels will be correlated with the magnitude of weight loss and&#xD;
      improvements in CVD risk factors and endothelial function following bariatric surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will enroll 32 children and adolescents (ages 8-17) who are scheduled for elective&#xD;
      bariatric surgery. They will be evaluated prior to their surgery, six months after surgery&#xD;
      and twelve months after surgery.&#xD;
