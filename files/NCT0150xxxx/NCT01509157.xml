  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have developed a unique Remote &amp; Safety diabetes management system (MDRS)&#xD;
      that offers real-time remote monitoring and control of glucose levels. The system allows the&#xD;
      supervising personal to alarm the patient and intervene in cases such as pending&#xD;
      hypoglycemia, long standing hyperglycemia or technical faults.The aim of this feasibility&#xD;
      study is to evaluate the efficacy of the MDRS system in preventing nocturnal hypoglycemia in&#xD;
      children and young adults with type 1 diabetes.&#xD;
