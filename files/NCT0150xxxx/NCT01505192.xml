      Aim of this study is to determine the physiological reference individual values (RI) of&#xD;
      maternal continuous SpHb immediately after delivery in the post-partum period (continuous&#xD;
      monitoring up to 2 hours after delivery) in order to establish the physiological Hb&#xD;
      variations in response to the physiological blood loss due to delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During labor all parturients will be tested for standard Laboratory Hb and monitored for at&#xD;
      least 30 minutes with SpHb monitoring equipment (Radical-7™ Pulse CO-Oximeter and Rainbow&#xD;
      DiSposable™ Adult Adhesive Sensor), and these values will be considered to be the baseline&#xD;
      values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately after spontaneous vaginal delivery, venous blood sample will be taken for Hb&#xD;
      determination and Radical 7 equipment for SpHb will be connected to the patient's finger and&#xD;
      will be recorded for at least two hours after delivery. At the end of this period of&#xD;
      observation a venous blood sample will be taken for Hb determination. Additional measurements&#xD;
      of both SpHb and Lab Hb will be performed 24 hours after delivery.&#xD;

      Background and Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnancy and childbirth involve health risks, even for women without any pre-existing health&#xD;
      problems. Postpartum hemorrhage is one of most common complications for delivering mothers&#xD;
      and causes 19% of in-hospital maternal deaths (Bateman BT et al. &quot;The Epidemiology of&#xD;
      Postpartum Hemorrhage in a Large, Nationwide Sample of Deliveries&quot; Anesthesia and Analgesia&#xD;
      2010 110:1368-1373) . Due to pregnancy physiological changes, maternal bleeding is typically&#xD;
      discovered after a significant change in vital signs, and/or symptoms, and usually confirmed&#xD;
      with an invasive laboratory hemoglobin test. This can result in late detection of bleeding&#xD;
      that can affect patient outcome. Early detection of signs and symptoms of obstetric&#xD;
      hemorrhage is therefore crucial. Non-invasive and continuous hemoglobin (SpHb) monitoring&#xD;
      system quickly measures current hemoglobin levels and continuously tracks them in real-time&#xD;
      to detect falling hemoglobin levels that may, in turn, represent an early sign of a potential&#xD;
      hemorrhage. Unfortunately there is no validation of the clinical accuracy of the Rainbow&#xD;
      device for the noninvasive and continuous hemoglobin (SpHb) monitoring in the obstetric&#xD;
      setting nor any information concerning its use as a tool for the early detection of&#xD;
      postpartum hemorrhage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators therefore propose to undertake an open, preliminary, sequential pilot study&#xD;
      to determine the physiological values (RI) of maternal continuous SpHb in the post-partum&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the physiological reference individual values (RI) of maternal continuous SpHb&#xD;
      immediately after delivery in the post-partum period (continuous monitoring up to 2 hours&#xD;
      after delivery) in order to establish the physiological Hb variations in response to the&#xD;
      physiological blood loss due to delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion and exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy parturients in labor will be asked to be enrolled in the study and informed consent&#xD;
      will be obtained.Parturients will be consecutively included in this study. Bleeding risk&#xD;
      subjects will be excluded (parturients who had:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operative or instrumental vaginal delivery,Estimated blood loss greater than 500 mL, who had&#xD;
      II and III degree perineal lacerations, any coagulation disorder or anticoagulant therapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Since we have no available information on the expected distribution of the&#xD;
      outcome, we will use a sequential design. The main endpoint of our analysis will be a&#xD;
      reliable estimate for the outcome expected in healthy women after labor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will state their target estimate as being reliable when the ratio between&#xD;
      the estimate and its standard error is smaller than 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) and Clinical Laboratory and&#xD;
      Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines in 2008 recommended to establish RIs with at least 120&#xD;
      reference individuals using the nonparametric ranking method (Clinical and Laboratory&#xD;
      Standards Institute. Defining, Establishing, and Verifying Reference Intervals in the&#xD;
      Clinical Laboratory; Approved Guideline. 3rd ed. Wayne, PA: CLSI; 2008) and thus we will&#xD;
      include in the study a sample of at least 120.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods During labor all parturients will be tested for standard Laboratory Hb and monitored&#xD;
      for at least 30 minutes with SpHb monitoring equipment (Radical-7™ Pulse CO-Oximeter and&#xD;
      Rainbow DiSposable™ Adult Adhesive Sensor), and these values will be considered to be the&#xD;
      baseline values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately after spontaneous vaginal delivery, venous blood sample will be taken for Hb&#xD;
      determination and Radical 7 equipment for SpHb will be connected to the patient's finger and&#xD;
      will be recorded for at least two hours after delivery. At the end of this period of&#xD;
      observation a venous blood sample will be taken for Hb determination. Additional measurements&#xD;
      of both SpHb and Lab Hb will be performed 24 hours after delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the SpHB data collection-research protocol, sensor site will be connected to the&#xD;
      patient's ring finger of the non-dominant hand. Sensor handling and placement will also&#xD;
      follow the instructions of the SpHB data collection-research protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensor will be attached to the same arm as the blood draw. Sensor placement on the hand of&#xD;
      the side with the blood pressure cuff will be avoided unless they are drawing blood from that&#xD;
      extremity. Placing the sensor and drawing blood from the same arm that is being used for IV&#xD;
      infusions will be also avoided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SpHb results will be not included when the Perfusion Index (PI, noninvasive index of&#xD;
      peripheral perfusion and vasomotor tone) values will be less than 0.5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concerning blood sampling, blood will be drawn directly into the vacutainer by using a needle&#xD;
      no smaller than 20G and analyzed within 15 min of the blood draw.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Vivo adjustment and Trend Accuracy&#xD;
&#xD;
      SpHb accuracy with an in vivo adjustment will be calculated by using the new Radical 7&#xD;
      equipment with in vivo adjustment feature software which will take the bias between the first&#xD;
      SpHb and first laboratory tHb measurement and will adjust all subsequent measurements for&#xD;
      that case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trend accuracy will be calculated by using the following time points: pre-delivery, 2 hrs&#xD;
      after delivery and 24 hr after delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calibrated SpHb measurements will be compared to subsequent laboratory values to create a&#xD;
      Bland Altman plot and calculate bias, and confidence interval.&#xD;
