      It is inevitable that nearly both anesthesiologist and nurse anesthetist take a zero&#xD;
      tolerance approach to avoidable safety problems in the provision of anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We would like to study the stress upon anesthesia personnel by using Suanprung Stress Test&#xD;
      (SST) - a well-documented, psychological stress test, and Siriraj Anesthesia-related Stress&#xD;
      Test (SAST) - a new developed open-ended opinion poll, to scrutinize the daily rounds stress&#xD;
      and yield the solution to eradicate or alleviate those worries as well as improve both&#xD;
      physical and mental health to handle the situation of difficulties.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study to survey the stress upon anesthesia personnel and verify causes&#xD;
      and risk factors to their stress. A message of persuading is conducted among the anesthesia&#xD;
      personnel in university, municipal and private hospitals. We ask participants to voluntarily&#xD;
      response all items in questionnaires of the SST and SAST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We launch a communication channel with the anesthesia personnel at www.nmac.in.th and require&#xD;
      that qualified participants register and express their intention to join this research&#xD;
      project. Each registered participant receives an identification number and a log-in password&#xD;
      to the website containing the SST and SAST courseware database. The program is interactive,&#xD;
      with personal files for each participant on each test along with other details like code,&#xD;
      password, date-month-year, test scores, and log-in periods and time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We introduced the 20 questionnaires of the SST courseware, to the developed system via&#xD;
      http://www.dmh.go.th/test/stress/ before performing it under the research approach via&#xD;
      www.nmac.in.th website. The findings revealed that the system operating units were flexible&#xD;
      to participants' interactive behavior, instruction and responsiveness. Access to the system&#xD;
      through the website provided ready access to the information, was user-friendly, and was&#xD;
      stable. In addition, the tools were objective, covered complete details, and were clear, with&#xD;
      elements of the subject content in proper order.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. SST courseware comprises of 60 questionnaires with scoring through five choices: most&#xD;
           stressful (5), highly stressful (4), moderately stressful (3), mildly stressful (2), and&#xD;
           no stressful (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
           In addition, the tests underwent verification for content validity and had index of item&#xD;
           objective congruence (IOC) determined by experts; with &gt; 0.8 in Cronbach's alpha&#xD;
           reliability coefficient; r &gt; 0.27 in concurrent validity through calculation of Pearson&#xD;
           Product moment correlation against an electromyogram biofeedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. SAST courseware comprises of 6 sections with scoring through visual analog scale and&#xD;
           allowing open-ended opinions. The questionnaires had undergone quality analysis and&#xD;
           verification for conciseness, accuracy, and clarity, as well as content and structural&#xD;
           validity by three doctorate educational experts with at least a decade of teaching&#xD;
           experience. The questionnaires' IOC was 0.79. The open-ended questionnaire is composed&#xD;
           of the following sections: (1) background data: age, gender, experience in anesthesia;&#xD;
           (2) working data: working time, overnight job, numbers of call; (3) personal data:&#xD;
           sleeping time; (4) patient safety issues: frequency of various situations involving&#xD;
           unsafe actions, occurrence of operating room events; (5) attitudes toward production&#xD;
           pressure: depression, fatigue, confusion, tension/anxiety, and anger; and (6) ratings of&#xD;
           sources of production pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We ask participants to voluntarily response all items in the SST and SAST. However, they have&#xD;
      rights not to answer any questions that put them in an awkward position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target group: Providing the data approximates to 1,000 anesthesiologists and 3,000 nurse&#xD;
      anesthetists who have formally performed patient care. Participation is voluntary, without&#xD;
      any honorarium, their only benefit is self-awareness of stress. Whether or not they&#xD;
      participated does not affect their careers in any way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target group size: Two hundred and eighty six out of 1,000 anesthesiologists and three&#xD;
      hundred and fifty three out of 3,000 nurse anesthetists are qualified as the final study&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure: After participants log in with their codes and passwords given to them, they then&#xD;
      study the www.nmac.in.th website at their leisure for the content of the SST and SAST&#xD;
      designed through questionnaires. Their scores are immediately provided with the completion of&#xD;
      a testing courseware and their individual profiles updated as well. Those feeling overwhelmed&#xD;
      by the conditions are allowed to withdraw from the project anytime.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this research, we are willing to answer queries about the project procedure and&#xD;
      monitor individual participants' progress through the website while keeping confidential the&#xD;
      data about individual participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A psychologist assesses the individual stress, which expressed as mean and standard&#xD;
           deviation. All associated factors are compared by the chi-square test. Statistical&#xD;
           significance is defined as p &lt; 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Information from an open-ended questionnaire: This information yields mean and standard&#xD;
           deviation values along with content analysis for use in our subsequent discussion.&#xD;
