  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  determine the effects of 12 weeks of HMB free acid gel, ATP, and HMB free acid gel plus&#xD;
           ATP supplementation in trained individuals during a periodized training program on&#xD;
           skeletal muscle hypertrophy, body composition, strength, force, velocity, and peak power&#xD;
           during loaded and unloaded vertical jumps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the study will determine if either supplementation protocol prevents the&#xD;
      typical decay seen in performance following an overreaching cycle performed in the 9th and&#xD;
      10th weeks of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the study will elucidate the mechanisms of action of supplementation on protein&#xD;
      breakdown by analyzing serum indices of muscle damage (CK, LDH) and anabolic status&#xD;
      (Testosterone:Cortisol ratio) as well as a urinary indicator of protein breakdown&#xD;
      (3-methylhistidine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that under these conditions that the supplementation protocols will augment&#xD;
      skeletal muscle hypertrophy, strength, and power and that HMB will blunt increases in serum&#xD;
      indices of muscle damage, and urinary indices of protein breakdown.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a randomized and double blind study the subjects will consume either placebo supplements,&#xD;
      HMB supplement, ATP supplement, or HMB plus ATP supplements for 12 weeks. While consuming the&#xD;
      supplements the subjects will undergo an extensive resistance training program designed to&#xD;
      train all major muscle groups. An additional overreaching training cycle during weeks 9 and&#xD;
      10 which will involve a high-volume, hypertrophy style training program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject testing will consist of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Strength and power at weeks 0, 1, 4, 8, 9, 10, and 12&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Range of motion and muscle soreness at weeks 0, 1, 8, 9, and 10&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body composition and muscle assessments at weeks 0, 1, 4, 8, 9, 10, and 12&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body fat assessments at weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood biochemical measurements at weeks 0, 1, 4, 8, 9, 10, and 12&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urinary analysis for protein breakdown (3-methylhistidine) at 0, 1, 8, 9, and 10 weeks&#xD;
