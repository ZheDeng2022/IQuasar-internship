  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tumour angiogenesis has been identified to play a critical role in tumour growth and this&#xD;
      knowledge has led to the identification of new targets for cancer therapy. Multiple&#xD;
      angiogenic factors are involved in the regulation of angiogenesis, among them VEGF (vascular&#xD;
      endothelial growth factor) and its receptor are of crucial relevance. The inhibition of VEGF&#xD;
      signaling by monoclonal antibodies or small molecules (kinase inhibitors) has already been&#xD;
      successfully established for the treatment of different cancer entities and multiple new&#xD;
      drugs are being tested in clinical trials. The ever-expanding list of antiangiogenic agents&#xD;
      being available in the near future will raise the questions when to use which agent and in&#xD;
      which sequence. As a consequence biomarkers are going to be indispensible tools for choosing&#xD;
      the most effective drugs and to predict dosing and resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present project is based on an academic clinical trial in which patients suffering from&#xD;
      different cancer types (colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell cancer and&#xD;
      hepatocellular cancer) treated routinely with antiangiogenic agents will be included.&#xD;
      Consecutive serum and blood probes will be taken and will be examined and correlated with&#xD;
      functional imaging and the clinical course. The following parameters have been selected:&#xD;
      soluble markers in the plasma (VEGF, bFGF, ICAM, sVGFR-2 IL-8, SDF1 and Dickkopf 3) and&#xD;
      cellular parameters like circulating endothelial cells (CEC) and circulating endothelial&#xD;
      progenitor cells (CEPs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, the present project is screening for potential biomarkers and biomarker&#xD;
      combinations relevant for antiangiogenic drugs in different tumour types. The predictive&#xD;
      value of such profiles should then be evaluated in larger cohorts. In the future such&#xD;
      profiles could possibly help clinicians to use these agents more effectively and therefore&#xD;
      also more economically.&#xD;
