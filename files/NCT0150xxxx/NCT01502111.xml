    <textblock>
      An international airway management expert group has recently developed an Utstein-style&#xD;
      template for uniform reporting of data from prehospital advanced airway management.&#xD;
      Implementing and validating the template will result in a high quality dataset and allow for&#xD;
      research cooperation and comparison of airway management practice between EMS systems, and&#xD;
      across different patient populations. Such a dataset will hopefully contribute to new&#xD;
      knowledge in the field of prehospital advanced airway management.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Advanced airway management and ventilatory control is generally regarded as vital in the&#xD;
      management of seriously ill or injured patients, and can be critical interventions in&#xD;
      patients with out-of-hospital emergencies. However, interventions like endotracheal&#xD;
      intubation suffer from lack of clear evidence of a beneficial effect. Despite the publication&#xD;
      of numerous airway management studies, inconsistent and imprecise reporting of data across&#xD;
      heterogenous patient populations and EMS systems persists. The questions of how, and by whom,&#xD;
      pre-hospital advanced airway management should be performed remains disputed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several authors have proposed appropriate guidelines and algorithms for management of&#xD;
      prehospital airway and difficult intubation. The guidelines emphasize the importance of&#xD;
      promoting patient safety and avoiding errors, and also recognise the importance of rescuers&#xD;
      level of airway skills competence. Drug-assisted rapid sequence intubation (RSI) is an&#xD;
      important, but potentially harmful, component of prehospital advanced airway management in&#xD;
      EMS services. Even physicians working in the prehospital scene may find it challenging to&#xD;
      maintain an adequate level of advanced airway competence in order to stay proficient. Better&#xD;
      training methods and systems are warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recognition of endotracheal intubation as a &quot;complex intervention&quot; marks the need for an&#xD;
      international standard for documenting and reporting data from prehospital intubations in&#xD;
      severely injured or ill patients, alongside a standardization of research data collection to&#xD;
      eliminate confounding factors. An international airway management expert group has recently&#xD;
      developed an Utstein-style template for uniform reporting of data from prehospital advanced&#xD;
      airway management. Implementing and validating the template will result in a high quality&#xD;
      dataset and allow for research cooperation and comparison of airway management practice&#xD;
      between EMS systems, and across different patient populations. Such a dataset will hopefully&#xD;
      contribute to new knowledge in the field of prehospital advanced airway management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims for the first two studies in this project are defined as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Describe the characteristics and outcome of advanced prehospital airway management in&#xD;
           Helicopter Emergency Medical Services (HEMS) that provide the full range of advanced&#xD;
           emergency airway management.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Identify which groups of critically injured or ill patients will benefit most from&#xD;
           competent advanced prehospital airway management, and identify specific areas for future&#xD;
           research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this multicentre study, we have enlisted 21 key international HEMS services from 6&#xD;
      countries (UK, Australia, Hungary, Finland, Switzerland and Norway), and will collect data&#xD;
      according to the Utstein style template over a 12 month study period starting January 1,&#xD;
      2012.&#xD;

We will calculate airway intervention success rates, frequency and complications for the entire cohort and for key subsets (like cardiac arrest, medical, trauma, pediatric patients and RSI/alternative airways), population demographics and prevalence of adverse effects (like missed intubations, bradycardia, hypotension, hypoxia). Outcome and patient characteristics will be analysed and described.</description>

             adjunct (including endotracheal intubation, alternative airways, and surgical airway&#xD;

             (including bag-mask ventilation-BMV, BIPAP/CPAP or other ventilatory support).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Advanced prehospital advanced airway management is further defined as any airway&#xD;
