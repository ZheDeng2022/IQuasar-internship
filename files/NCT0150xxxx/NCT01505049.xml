  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vaccines for human papillomavirus (HPV) have been available in the United States since 2006.&#xD;
      Early studies have shown a high rate of effectiveness of these vaccines, however it is not&#xD;
      known how long this protection will last. The IMAP study will look at various parts of the&#xD;
      immune system and potential markers for long lived immune responses to this vaccine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Three groups of patients will be recruited for this study. One group will be women who have&#xD;
      completed all three vaccinations. The second group will be women who are overdue for their&#xD;
      final vaccination. We also recruit women who have not been vaccinated previously.&#xD;

             devices and a history of sterilization will also be considered reliable forms of birth&#xD;

          2. Underlying immunological disease, such as previously diagnosed HIV infection or&#xD;
             history of transplantation, history of splenectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Use of medications with potential immunological effects such as systemic&#xD;
             corticosteroids or chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Prior therapy for cervical dysplasia or cervical cancer such as loop excision, laser&#xD;
             ablation, cryotherapy or hysterectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Unable to comply with protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) after a previous vaccine dose or to a&#xD;
             vaccine component&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. An acute illness, including an oral temperature of 100.4 degrees F within three days&#xD;
             of visit&#xD;
