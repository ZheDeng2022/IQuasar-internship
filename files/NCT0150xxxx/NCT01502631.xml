    <measure>Total Spinal Cord Independence Measure, Version III (SCIM III) Score Following Treatment With SUN13837 Injection or Placebo in Adult With Acute Spinal Cord Injury</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 2, week 4, week 8 and week 16 post dose.</time_frame>
    <description>The SCIM III is a comprehensive rating scale that measures the ability of participants with spinal cord injury to perform everyday tasks. The SCIM III has 19 items that assess 3 domains: Self-Care (6 items, scores range from 0 to 20), Respiration and Sphincter Management (4 items, scores range from 0 to 40), and Mobility (9 items, scores range from 0 to 40). The total SCIM score ranges from 0 to a maximum of 100 points in an individual with a fully functional spinal cord. A score of 0 indicates a worse outcome and a score of 100 indicates a better outcome. An improvement of at least 4 points of the total SCIM showed a small significant improvement, and 10 points showed a substantial improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline of Total Motor Score (TMS) of International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI) Following Treatment With SUN13837 Injection or Placebo in Adult With Acute Spinal Cord Injury</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Day 3, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8, and Week 16 post dose.</time_frame>
    <description>TMS was the sum of the overall Upper Extremity Motor Score (UEMS) and the overall Lower Extremity Motor Score (LEMS) of ISNCSCI. The score on the scale runs from a minimum value of 0 to a maximum of 100 points in an individual with a fully functional spinal cord. A score of 0 indicates a worse outcome and a score of 100 indicates a better outcome. The UEMS was defined as the sum of the motor function scores in the cervical spinal segments C5, C6, C7, C8, and T1. A separate sum was obtained for the right and left sides (a maximum of 25 points each) and for an overall score (with a maximum score of 50). The LEMS was defined as the sum of the motor function scores in the spinal segments lumbar level 2, lumbar level 3, lumbar level 4, lumbar level 5, and sacral level 1. A separate sum was obtained for the right and left sides (a maximum of 25 points each) and for an overall score (with a maximum score of 50).</description>

    <description>The SCIM III is a comprehensive rating scale that measures the ability of participants with spinal cord injury to perform everyday tasks. The SCIM III has 19 items that assess 3 domains, two of which are Self-care and Mobility. The self-care domain is a subscale of 6 items and scores range from 0 to 20 (higher scores indicate a better outcome). The mobility domain consists of 9 items with subscale scores range from 0 to 40 (higher scores indicate a better outcome). The score for the combined Self-Care and Mobility subscale ranges from 0 - 60 points; higher scores indicate a better outcome</description>

        <title>Total Spinal Cord Independence Measure, Version III (SCIM III) Score Following Treatment With SUN13837 Injection or Placebo in Adult With Acute Spinal Cord Injury</title>
        <description>The SCIM III is a comprehensive rating scale that measures the ability of participants with spinal cord injury to perform everyday tasks. The SCIM III has 19 items that assess 3 domains: Self-Care (6 items, scores range from 0 to 20), Respiration and Sphincter Management (4 items, scores range from 0 to 40), and Mobility (9 items, scores range from 0 to 40). The total SCIM score ranges from 0 to a maximum of 100 points in an individual with a fully functional spinal cord. A score of 0 indicates a worse outcome and a score of 100 indicates a better outcome. An improvement of at least 4 points of the total SCIM showed a small significant improvement, and 10 points showed a substantial improvement.</description>

        <title>Sensitivity Analyses of Total Spinal Cord Independence Measure, Version III (SCIM III) Score at Week 16 by Treatment Group</title>
        <description>The SCIM III is a comprehensive rating scale that measures the ability of participants with spinal cord injury to perform everyday tasks. The SCIM III has 19 items that assess 3 domains: Self-Care (6 items, scores range from 0 to 20), Respiration and Sphincter Management (4 items, scores range from 0 to 40), and Mobility (9 items, scores range from 0 to 40). The total SCIM score ranges from 0 to a maximum of 100 points in an individual with a fully functional spinal cord. A score of 0 indicates a worse outcome and a score of 100 indicates a better outcome. An improvement of at least 4 points of the total SCIM showed a small significant improvement, and 10 points showed a substantial improvement.</description>
        <time_frame>Week 16 post dose</time_frame>
        <population>Sensitivity analyses were assessed in the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) and Efficacy Evaluable (EE) populations. The EE Population consisted of all subjects in the ITT Population who did not have any major protocol violations that impacted efficacy and were observed for efficacy for at least 2 SCIM III evaluations.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline of Total Motor Score (TMS) of International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI) Following Treatment With SUN13837 Injection or Placebo in Adult With Acute Spinal Cord Injury</title>
        <description>TMS was the sum of the overall Upper Extremity Motor Score (UEMS) and the overall Lower Extremity Motor Score (LEMS) of ISNCSCI. The score on the scale runs from a minimum value of 0 to a maximum of 100 points in an individual with a fully functional spinal cord. A score of 0 indicates a worse outcome and a score of 100 indicates a better outcome. The UEMS was defined as the sum of the motor function scores in the cervical spinal segments C5, C6, C7, C8, and T1. A separate sum was obtained for the right and left sides (a maximum of 25 points each) and for an overall score (with a maximum score of 50). The LEMS was defined as the sum of the motor function scores in the spinal segments lumbar level 2, lumbar level 3, lumbar level 4, lumbar level 5, and sacral level 1. A separate sum was obtained for the right and left sides (a maximum of 25 points each) and for an overall score (with a maximum score of 50).</description>

        <description>The SCIM III is a comprehensive rating scale that measures the ability of participants with spinal cord injury to perform everyday tasks. The SCIM III has 19 items that assess 3 domains, two of which are Self-care and Mobility. The self-care domain is a subscale of 6 items and scores range from 0 to 20 (higher scores indicate a better outcome). The mobility domain consists of 9 items with subscale scores range from 0 to 40 (higher scores indicate a better outcome). The score for the combined Self-Care and Mobility subscale ranges from 0 - 60 points; higher scores indicate a better outcome</description>
