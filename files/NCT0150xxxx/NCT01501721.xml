      Objective: This study aimed to characterize the food intake and energy expenditure of school&#xD;
      cooks and to evaluate the anthropometric and metabolic changes that occurred after a&#xD;
      low-volume home-based exercise program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A randomized clinical trial in the city of Niteroi, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, was&#xD;
      conducted during the school year of 2007. The trial had a factorial design based on two&#xD;
      different interventions: 1) nutritional counseling and 2) home-based exercise. The&#xD;
      nutritional intervention was focused on decreasing the amount of sugar used in school meals&#xD;
      by the cooks as well as decreasing their own sugar intake. The exercise program consisted of&#xD;
      stretching and aerobic exercises that could be practiced at home, at least three times per&#xD;
      week (40 minutes per session), with a low-to-moderate intensity.&#xD;

      A randomized clinical trial in the city of Niteroi, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, was conducted&#xD;
      during the school year of 2007 (March to December 2007). The trial had a factorial design&#xD;
      based on two different interventions: 1) nutritional counseling and 2) home-based exercise.&#xD;
      The present study focused on the effects of exercise intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of the 36 public schools spread over five different areas, we selected 20 schools from three&#xD;
      areas with similar demographic and socio-economic profiles. Because of the small number of&#xD;
      male cooks (n=5), we included only women who were neither pregnant nor breastfeeding. Cooks&#xD;
      on sick leave or those working in other capacities were excluded. A total of 101 cooks were&#xD;
      eligible, and six refused to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants received information about the goals of the study and signed a document&#xD;
      indicating informed consent. The study was approved by the institutional review board of the&#xD;
      State University of Rio de Janeiro.&#xD;
&#xD;
      School cooks enrolled in the present study were public servants and work in periods of eight&#xD;
      hours, five days per week, in three different shifts (morning, afternoon and night). They are&#xD;
      responsible to prepare all meals served at school and cleaning up, and schools do not have&#xD;
      any machine to help them to perform their tasks. They eat at least one meal at school.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size As previously reported13), the sample size was calculated assuming an individual&#xD;
      reduction of 10% in sugar consumption (3.4 grams) with a power of 80% and a 5% significance&#xD;
      level. Anticipating a rate of participation agreement around 80%, the total sample size was&#xD;
      estimated to be 80 school cooks. For this purpose, 20 schools employing a total of 130 school&#xD;
      cooks were randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Nutritional and exercise counseling were given during the school year of 2007&#xD;
      (eight months). The nutritional counseling group received information focused on decreasing&#xD;
      the amount of sugar used in school meals, as well as their own sugar intake. They&#xD;
      participated in three nutritional education meetings regarding sugar intake and food label.&#xD;
      All activities were realized at school and required about 20 minutes. In addition, they&#xD;
      participated in a contest to create reduced-sugar recipes and banners, and magnets promoting&#xD;
      the reduction of sugar intake were also provided. All school cooks, from both the control and&#xD;
      nutritional counseling groups, participated in three discussion sessions about healthy&#xD;
      eating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exercise intervention group received received a booklet on physical exercises, consisted&#xD;
      of stretching and aerobic exercises that could be practiced at home at least three times per&#xD;
      week for 40 minutes (per session) at low-to-moderate intensity (available at www.nebin.org).&#xD;
      The exercise sessions were divided into three parts: 1) A warm-up routine consisting of&#xD;
      gentle body movement and stretching exercises (5 minutes); 2) An aerobic cycle performed in a&#xD;
      circuit with continuous movements involving large arm and leg muscles, as well as exercises&#xD;
      using a ball, ropes, stair climbing, and standing up from a chair (balls and ropes were given&#xD;
      to the participants) (30 minutes); and 3) a cool-down period, in which the same initial&#xD;
      stretching exercises were performed (5 minutes). The participants were encouraged to engage&#xD;
      in exercise of low-to-moderate intensity with low impact at least three times a week during&#xD;
      the eight months. In the first week, women were advised to perform only a 20-minute session,&#xD;
      increasing gradually (10 minutes/session/week) up to 40 minutes per session. Each session&#xD;
      comprised activities with balls, ropes, stairs and chair. Additionally, they were advised to&#xD;
      reduce the exercise intensity if they felt any discomfort (e.g., if they were experiencing&#xD;
      breathlessness or muscle aches). School cooks allocated to control group received only&#xD;
      general information for physical activity and did not received the booklet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements The anthropometric variables were collected at three different times (baseline,&#xD;
      4 and 8 months), while individual food intake, based on a previously validated food frequency&#xD;
      questionnaire14), and fasting blood samples were collected at baseline and after 8 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Height was measured to the nearest 0.5 cm with a wall-mounted stadiometer, and body weight&#xD;
      was measured using the same calibrated digital scale (Tanita, BC 533 Inner Scan) for all&#xD;
      participants. Circumference measurements were taken at the largest girth of the hip and&#xD;
      smallest girth of the waist. All anthropometric measurements were performed according to&#xD;
      standard techniques15).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples were collected in the morning after 10 hours of fasting. Plasma lipids and&#xD;
      glucose were measured using GoldAnalisa kits. The LDL and VLDL cholesterol concentrations&#xD;
      were calculated according to the Friedewald equation16) based on the triacylglycerol&#xD;
      measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical activity energy expenditure at baseline was evaluated in a sub-sample of 30&#xD;
      participants using an accelerometer (ActicalÂ® physical activity monitor, Mini Mitter, Bend,&#xD;
      OR, USA). The accelerometer was programmed according to the manufacturer's instructions by&#xD;
      entering the height, weight, age and sex of each subject. The subjects were instructed to&#xD;
      place the accelerometers at their waists and wear them continuously for two consecutive days,&#xD;
      except during activities in which contact with water could occur (e.g., during a bath).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis The characteristics of school cooks were expressed as means with standard&#xD;
      deviations, and we compared the two intervention groups at baseline by using Student's&#xD;
      t-test. The effects of nutritional counselling and home-based exercise on weight and&#xD;
      circumference were evaluated through repeated random regression (RRR) analysis using PROC&#xD;
      MIXED in SAS (version 9.1; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). The analysis for the effects of&#xD;
      exercise intervention was adjusted for dietary intervention while the analysis for the&#xD;
      effects of nutritional counselling was adjusted for exercise intervention. The RRR is an&#xD;
      intention-to-treat analysis because it includes all observations of each one of the subjects&#xD;
      regardless of loss to follow-up or complies with instructions. The term of interest was&#xD;
      treatment X time interaction, which estimates the rate of change in the outcomes over time.&#xD;
      Residual plots of all models were examined, and their distribution did not show major&#xD;
      deviations from regression assumptions. Changes in plasma lipids and glucose (samples of&#xD;
      which were taken twice) between the groups were determined by Student's t-test.&#xD;
