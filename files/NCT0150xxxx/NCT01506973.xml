  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this Phase I/II clinical trial, the investigators seek to pilot the addition of&#xD;
      Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) to a commonly-used front-line therapy of pancreatic cancer,&#xD;
      gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel. The investigators plan a run-in to define tolerable doses, and&#xD;
      will explore doses of 800 and 1200 mg/day in successive cohorts of 6 patients. The&#xD;
      investigators will assess toxicity continuously, and determine the dose for the Phase II&#xD;
      trial based on standard toxicity criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The correlative endpoints of this trial are directed to the pharmacokinetics of HCQ, and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic model of HCQ based on data from several ongoing trials, and the data from&#xD;
      these patients will contribute to refining the model. The investigators will analyze both&#xD;
      measured and model-predicted indices for their relationship to autophagy induction. Autophagy&#xD;
      will be assessed as the accumulation of autophagocytic vesicles in the PMNs of treated&#xD;
      patients, together with the induction of the expression of autophagy-related proteins on&#xD;
      western analysis, quantitated by densitometry. The investigators will document the rates of&#xD;
      metabolic response as a consequence of treatment, as a therapeutic marker that may be related&#xD;
      to the degree of autophagy inhibition. Since the investigators have previously demonstrated a&#xD;
      key role of JNK1 in the induction of autophagy by chemotherapy, the investigators will&#xD;
      analyze archival tumor materials to determine variability in this marker, as a baseline for&#xD;
      potential future trials. Finally, this study will incorporate metabolic profiling by mass&#xD;
      spectrometry, which will be related to mutations (including Kras) in pretreatment tumor&#xD;
      specimens. Mutational analysis will be accomplished by targeted sequencing or by&#xD;
      next-generation sequencing, and the need for fresh tissue for all these endpoints will&#xD;
      require patients to have a biopsy performed before treatment at at 6-8 weeks after beginning&#xD;
      treatment. In the previous study of the Hh inhibitor GDC-0973 with the same chemotherapy, the&#xD;
      investigators were able to obtain repeat biopsies successfully on all patients. The&#xD;
      importance of these biopsies, to move the science forward in an era in which the tools now&#xD;
      exist to provide meaningful correlative science, cannot be overstated.&#xD;

      Recent strategies have focused on improving the efficacy of gemcitabine either by improving&#xD;
      the method of delivery, or by combining gemcitabine with other non-cross resistant agents. A&#xD;
      sequence of Phase III combination studies of gemcitabine in combination (with oxaliplatin,&#xD;
      and with the targeted therapies bevacizumab and cetuximab) have been negative, though based&#xD;
      on strikingly positive Phase II data generated in cancer centers. Several studies suggest&#xD;
      that taxanes are active in pancreatic cancer, but a randomized trial of gemcitabine with&#xD;
      taxanes has not been preformed, probably on the basis that the differences in Phase II were&#xD;
      insufficiently persuasive. The development of a novel taxane conjugate with albumin,&#xD;
      abraxane, with established activity in breast cancer, prompted a Phase II trial of&#xD;
      gemcitabine/abraxane by Von Hoff (6). Phase I/II data were highly promising, with response&#xD;
      rates of the order of 40%, with tolerable toxicity, and a one-year survival of about 48%. A&#xD;
      phase III trial of gemcitabine versus gemcitabine/abraxane is in progress, and based on these&#xD;
      promising data has served as the control chemotherapy for previous SU2C trials. The&#xD;
      development of a more intensive, but toxic regimen (FOLFIRINOX) in no way diminishes the&#xD;
      enthusiasm for this chemotherapy backbone, given the activity in Phase II trials that appears&#xD;
      comparable (7). Given the promise of this regimen, and the possibility of making a&#xD;
      substantial improvement in outcome with additional targeted interventions, we propose to&#xD;
      continue to use this regimen in the current study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of particular interest in extending these studies to pancreatic cancer is the finding that&#xD;
      autophagy inhibition is particularly deleterious to cell lines bearing a mutant Kras protein.&#xD;
      Additional studies as part of the SU2C pancreatic cancer project reveal that an autophagy&#xD;
      program is activated in the presence of mutant Kras, and thus prompts the testing of this&#xD;
      strategy in a setting in which Kras is commonly (about 85%) mutated (SU2C, unpublished data).&#xD;
