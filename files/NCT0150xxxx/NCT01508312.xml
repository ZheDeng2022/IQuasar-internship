  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is determine if 2 cycles of SGN-35 can be used instead of ICE prior&#xD;
      to autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) for relapsed and refractory HL. There are 2 steps&#xD;
      to treating patients with relapsed or refractory HL. The first step is to shrink the lymphoma&#xD;
      with chemotherapy. The chemotherapy regimen commonly used is called ICE. ICE is a combination&#xD;
      of chemotherapy drugs: ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide. The second step of treatment&#xD;
      is to give high doses of chemotherapy and radiation therapy followed by infusion of stem&#xD;
      cells. This is called an ASCT. This study will focus on the first step of treatment for&#xD;
      relapsed and refractory HL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ICE chemotherapy can cause many side effects. We believe that there are patients who can&#xD;
      receive less toxic treatments and still do well. We have learned from past studies that&#xD;
      [18F]FDG-PET scans (which we will call &quot;PET scans&quot;) can be used to predict who will do well&#xD;
      after ASCT. PET scans are tests used to measure the metabolic activity of the disease.&#xD;
      Patients without abnormal activity on their PET scan (negative PET scan) before ASCT are much&#xD;
      more likely to be cured than those with activity on their PET scan (positive PET scan).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, instead of beginning with ICE chemotherapy, the patient will receive a new&#xD;
      drug called Brentuximab vedotin (SGN-35). SGN-35 is a type of drug called an antibody drug&#xD;
      conjugate. SGN-35 has 2 parts; a part that targets cancer cells (the antibody) and a cell&#xD;
      killing part (the chemotherapy). The antibody part of SGN-35 sticks to a target called CD30.&#xD;
      CD30 is an important molecule on some cancer cells (including Hodgkin lymphoma) and some&#xD;
      normal cells of the immune system. The cell killing part of SGN-35 is a chemotherapy called&#xD;
      monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It can kill cells that the antibody part of SGN-35 sticks to.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared to ICE chemotherapy, SGN-has fewer side effects and does not require inpatient&#xD;
      admission for treatment. We aim to determine whether patients can avoid treatment with ICE&#xD;
      prior to ASCT. We will use the results of the PET scan to determine whether the patient needs&#xD;
      additional chemotherapy before ASCT. If the PET scan is negative, the patient will be&#xD;
      referred to ASCT and not receive ICE chemotherapy. If the PET scan is positive, the physician&#xD;
      will discuss further treatment options with the patient.&#xD;

Patients with pre-treatment positive bone marrow biopsies will have repeat bone marrow biopsies if the PET scan is negative. FDG-PET/CT will be repeated after 2 cycles of treatment within 1 week of the last dose of cycle 2. Patients with persistent abnormalities on FDG-PET/CT following 2 cycles of brentuximab vedotin will receive 2 cycles of augmented ICE. The first cycle of augmented ICE will be initiated 7-14 days after the last dose of SGN-35. FDG-PET/CT will be repeated within 7-14 days following the second cycle of augmented ICE. Stem cell mobilization can be performed following the first or second cycle of augmented ICE.</description>
