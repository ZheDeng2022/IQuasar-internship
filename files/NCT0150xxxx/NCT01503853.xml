      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The costs of medical care have a major effect on patients during illness and treatment.&#xD;
      Surveys with patients and doctors show that both are interested in discussing the costs of&#xD;
      treatment. But they rarely talk about these issues. Both worry about whether it is&#xD;
      appropriate to discuss financial matters in the clinical setting. They are also concerned&#xD;
      about whether this topic will be an awkward one. Researchers are interested in studying how&#xD;
      people want their doctors to talk to them about the costs of illness and medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To explore and better understand patients views on whether and how doctors should talk&#xD;
      about the costs of illness and medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - English- or Spanish-speaking adults (at least 18 years of age) who are covered by health&#xD;
      insurance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be asked to take part in a 2 1/2-hour focus group. Ten to 12 people&#xD;
           will come together to discuss their thoughts and opinions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A member of the research team will lead the group discussion. The leader will ask a list&#xD;
           of questions about health care payment issues. Those in the focus group will discuss&#xD;
           these issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive a small cash payment and a light snack.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cost of illness and medical care has profound implications for society as a whole and for&#xD;
      individual patients as they experience being sick and seeking treatment. It is both&#xD;
      appropriate and imperative that these costs be discussed in the doctor-patient encounter.&#xD;
      Surveys with patients and doctors show that both parties have the desire to discuss costs,&#xD;
      yet they rarely have these conversations because of worries about the appropriateness and&#xD;
      potential awkwardness of discussing financial matters in the clinical encounter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the existing literature we find that patients express a preference for more care, newer&#xD;
      care, and expensive care (as they believe cost indicates better care), and they react&#xD;
      negatively to conversations they perceive as encouraging rationing. Yet rationing - the use&#xD;
      of allocation criteria to distribute resources - is inevitable when resources are limited,&#xD;
      and acceptable when done fairly. Recognizing the need for bedside rationing and endeavoring&#xD;
      to promote bedside rationing are not antithetical to patient-centered care, however. Open and&#xD;
      honest conversations about rationing, when carried out appropriately, can be consistent with&#xD;
      patient-centered care and the view of patients as moral agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients resistance to discussions of rationing, coupled with the financial burden of illness&#xD;
      and the reality of rising health care costs, all point to the pressing need to explore&#xD;
      strategies for how physicians can address costs in ways that are understanding, empathic, and&#xD;
      palatable to patients. In the literature we find scant empirical evidence about how patients&#xD;
      would react to doctors talking about (and considering) costs. This study seeks the patient&#xD;
      perspective on how these honest conversations about costs can be carried out in a sensitive&#xD;
      and appropriate manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project aims to explore and better understand patients perspectives about whether and&#xD;
      how doctors should talk about and address the costs of illness and medical care. Ultimately&#xD;
      we hope to promote the ability of doctors to discuss and address financial issues in their&#xD;
      encounters with patients in a way that maintains trust, advocacy and integrity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be more receptive to discussing personal costs than societal (pooled)&#xD;
           costs with their physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Willingness to discuss personal cost in the clinical encounter will vary with&#xD;
           participant socio-demographic characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Following group discussions about addressing cost of care in the clinical encounter,&#xD;
           participants will be more receptive to discussion of costs in the clinical encounter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Following group discussion, participants will be more inclined to choose less expensive&#xD;
           care.&#xD;

        -  ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  RAND Corp Survey Research Group will be in charge of recruiting participants. They&#xD;
             will work with an experienced focus group recruitment vendor to identify, screen and&#xD;
             schedule eligible participants from the LA/Santa Monica area and the Washington DC&#xD;
             area. Candidates for the focus groups must be individuals who are 18 years old or&#xD;
             older, able to provide informed consent, and who speak English or Spanish well enough&#xD;
             to participate in one of the focus groups. In addition, participants must have health&#xD;
             insurance coverage at the time of recruitment. The focus groups will include a mix of&#xD;
             participants in terms of gender, age, race/ethnicity, educational level, SES, and&#xD;
             health insurance coverage type. While we will not be excluding HHS or other federal&#xD;
             employees from participating (as we see no compelling reason to do so), we will not be&#xD;
             recruiting predominantly HHS or other federal employees because we seek a&#xD;
             generalizable sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants will be either English or Spanish speaking adults. Focus groups will&#xD;
             include participants with the following varied characteristics:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  age (working adults with and without dependents and retirees); ethnic/racial groups&#xD;
             (African American, Latino, Non-Hispanic whites);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  varied economic status (incomes below 300% of the Federal poverty threshold, and&#xD;
             above).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Specifically, participants will be recruited to ensure sufficient socio-demographic&#xD;
             representation and adequate numbers to test our study hypotheses. Because we will&#xD;
             recruit subjects with the intention of producing generalizable results, we will not&#xD;
             recruit disproportionate numbers of HHS or other federal employees (although these&#xD;
             individuals will not be excluded from participation).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  After the two pilot groups, twenty focus groups each including 8-12 participants will&#xD;
             be conducted for a maximum total of 264 participants. Of the twenty focus groups,&#xD;
             sixteen will be conducted in English and 4 will be conducted in Spanish.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Half of participants will have incomes under 300% of the federal poverty threshold in&#xD;
             order to guarantee ascertainment of perspectives of participants of varied&#xD;
             socio-economic status.&#xD;
