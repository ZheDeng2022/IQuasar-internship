    <textblock>
      Dengue viruses can cause dengue fever and other serious health conditions, primarily&#xD;
      affecting people living in tropical regions of the world. This study will evaluate the safety&#xD;
      and immune responses to two formulations of a tetravalent dengue virus vaccine in healthy&#xD;
      adults who have previously been infected with a dengue virus or other flavivirus or have&#xD;
      previously received a flavivirus vaccine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dengue viruses cause dengue fever and the more severe condition, dengue hemorrhagic&#xD;
      fever/shock syndrome. Dengue viruses are common in most tropical and subtropical regions of&#xD;
      the world and infection with dengue viruses is the leading cause of hospitalization and death&#xD;
      in children in many tropical Asian countries. For these reasons, the World Health&#xD;
      Organization (WHO) has made the development of a dengue virus vaccine a top priority. This&#xD;
      study will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of two doses of a live attenuated,&#xD;
      tetravalent dengue virus vaccine called TetraVax-DV in healthy adults (18-50 years old) who&#xD;
      have previously been infected with a dengue virus or other flavivirus or have previously&#xD;
      received a flavivirus vaccine. Two different formulations of the TetraVax-DV vaccine will be&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive one of two admixtures of the TetraVax-DV&#xD;
      vaccine or a placebo. At a baseline study visit (Day 0), participants will undergo a medical&#xD;
      history review, physical examination, blood collection, vital sign measurements, and a&#xD;
      pregnancy test for females. Participants will then receive one subcutaneous (SC) injection of&#xD;
      their assigned vaccine or placebo in the upper arm. After receiving the vaccine, participants&#xD;
      will remain in the clinic for 30 minutes for observation and monitoring. At home,&#xD;
      participants will monitor and record their temperature three times a day for 16 days after&#xD;
      the first vaccination (from Day 0 through Day 16) and for 16 days after the second&#xD;
      vaccination (from Day 180 through Day 196). Additional study visits will occur at Days 3, 8,&#xD;
      10, 12, 14, 16, 21, 28, 56, 90, and 150 and will include a physical examination, vital sign&#xD;
      measurements, and blood collection. On Day 180, participants will receive a second SC&#xD;
      injection of their assigned vaccine or placebo. Additional study visits will then occur at&#xD;
      Days 183, 188, 190, 192, 194, 196, 201, 208, 236, 270, and 360, and will include the same&#xD;
      study procedures and monitoring that occurred after the first vaccination.&#xD;
