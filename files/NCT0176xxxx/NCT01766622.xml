      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - 18F-CP18 is a chemical designed for use in imaging studies. It is attracted to tumor cells&#xD;
      that are being killed by cancer treatment. Researchers want to test it in imaging studies for&#xD;
      people who are being treated with Birinapant. Birinapant is a drug used to treat advanced&#xD;
      ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancers. It works kills tumor cells that have not&#xD;
      responded to earlier treatment. 18F-CP18 may help to monitor cancer treatments with this&#xD;
      drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To test the effectiveness of 18F-CP18 imaging studies during cancer treatment with&#xD;
      Birinapant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who are taking Birinapant for ovarian, fallopian tube,&#xD;
      or peritoneal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a brief physical exam. They will also answer questions about&#xD;
           their medical history and any current medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive a dose of 18F-CP18, followed by an imaging study. The study&#xD;
           will involve a positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan. The scan&#xD;
           will last 40 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There will be two more PET/CT scans 1 hour and 2 hours after taking 18F-CP18. These&#xD;
           scans will look at how the tumor cells absorb and process 18F-CP18.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a scanning study only. No treatment will be provided as part of this study.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dysregulation of apoptosis is instrumental in forming the malignant phenotype and is&#xD;
      associated with resistance to chemotherapeutics and biological therapies. Cleaved Caspase 3&#xD;
      (its activated form) plays a key role in the common apoptotic pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CP18 is an enzyme substrate of caspase 3. The formulation [18F]-CP18 includes PEG vector&#xD;
      which facilitates internalization and can be non-invasively imaged using PET. Once cleaved&#xD;
      into polar fragments by caspase 3, it become trapped within the cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a phase 2 NCI clinical trial (NCI Protocol (#12C0191) CTEP 9235), Birinapant (TL32711), a&#xD;
      SMAC (second mitochondrial derived activator of caspase) mimetic, is being evaluated in&#xD;
      patients with relapsed platinum resistant or refractory epithelial ovarian cancer, primary&#xD;
      peritoneal cancer or fallopian tube cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PET/CT imaging with [18F]-CP18 may enable the non-invasive, in vivo monitoring of this drugs&#xD;
      pro-apoptotic effects. If a measureable effect is shown in this pilot study, further&#xD;
      evaluation of [18F]-CP18 PET/CT s potential to monitor apoptosis may be warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine tumor uptake and retention of [18F]-CP18 before and after treatment with a SMAC&#xD;
      mimetic (Birinapant, TL32711), in patients with relapsed platinum resistant or refractory&#xD;
      epithelial ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal cancer or fallopian tube cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects must meet the eligibility criteria for the phase 2 study of Birinapant (NCI&#xD;
      Protocol (#12C0191) CTEP 9235) and be enrolled in or planning to enroll in parent therapy&#xD;
      protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects must sign a document of informed consent indicating their understanding of the&#xD;
      investigational nature and risks of the study before any protocol related studies are&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot study to assess the change in [18F]-CP18 PET tumor uptake following treatment&#xD;
      with Birinapant, a SMAC mimetic drug, in patients with relapsed platinum resistant or&#xD;
      refractory epithelial ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal cancer or fallopian tube cancer.&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo at least 3 [18F]-CP18 PET/CT imaging studies,one pre-therapy, one&#xD;
      within 48 hours after receiving the initial dose of Birinapant, and a third scan within 48&#xD;
      hours after receiving cycle 2, day 15 dose of Birinapant and prior to the tumor biopsy on the&#xD;
      same day. An exploration of the relationship between PET imaging parameters and clinical&#xD;
      response and various biomarkers (as determined under the referring protocol) will also be&#xD;
      performed. Ten patients will be enrolled on this protocol.&#xD;
