      Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation dermatitis is a common problem in a significant proportion of breast cancer&#xD;
      patients. In addition, radiation dermatitis is a quantifiable complication which is&#xD;
      relatively easily observed and graded according to modified Radiation Therapy Oncology Group&#xD;
      (RTOG) criteria for toxicity. Radiation dermatitis is thought to be related to abrasion that&#xD;
      degrades the keratinized skin surface. This results in decreased ability of skin stem cells&#xD;
      to regenerate which leads to moist desquamation. A barrier film could potentially form a&#xD;
      protective scaffold for new skin growth and repair. Cavilon No Sting Barrier Film (BF) has&#xD;
      been shown in randomized trials involving post-mastectomy radiation patients to reduce the&#xD;
      duration and frequency of radiation-induced moist desquamation. However, this treatment has&#xD;
      not been studied in the statistically more prevalent situation of an intact breast.&#xD;
      Therefore, we propose to investigate Cavilon to reduce side-effects of radiation treatment in&#xD;
      intact breast cancer patients treated with conservative surgery and adjuvant radiation&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.0 STUDY OBJECTIVES 2.1 Primary Objectives To evaluate effectiveness of preventing Grade II&#xD;
      or greater radiation dermatitis induced by adjuvant radiation therapy in women with breast&#xD;
      cancer. The grading of dermatitis will be obtained according to modified RTOG scale for&#xD;
      visual assessment of radiation-induced skin erythema. This is attached as Appendix A. In&#xD;
      addition, Skin Toxicity Assessment Tool (STAT) will also be used by the patient and physician&#xD;
      validated against the quality of life tools and toxicity tools. This is attached as Appendix&#xD;
      B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Secondary Objectives Quality of Life The European Organization for Research and Treatment&#xD;
      of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) will be used to measure overall&#xD;
      quality of life. Quality of life has been considered an important contributor to overall&#xD;
      performance status and outcome. Quality of life consists of multiple components (e.g.&#xD;
      physical, social, and psychological aspects, etc.). Improved quality of life translates into&#xD;
      better outcomes, especially in the context of palliation. Global quality of life was found to&#xD;
      be significantly associated with survival in a general population of cancer patients in&#xD;
      Canada . In fact, many clinical trials in palliative care include improved quality of life&#xD;
      for cancer patients as a primary outcome. The EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30)&#xD;
      was developed in Europe and is frequently used to measure quality of life and its related&#xD;
      components . The EORTC QLQ C-30 is attached in appendix C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time to develop radiation dermatitis On each follow up visit, all patients will be assessed&#xD;
      for development of any grade of radiation dermatitis. The time to develop grade I, II and or&#xD;
      grade III radiation dermatitis will be calculated from the date of first dose of radiation&#xD;
      therapy delivered to the date of visit at which the grade of dermatitis is observed. Time to&#xD;
      additional treatment, i.e. over-the-counter or prescription interventions, will also be&#xD;
      measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Image An observer, blind to the regions treated by Cavilon, will also grade each paired&#xD;
      photographic image.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative Questions Qualitative questions are meant to ask personal opinion and&#xD;
      perspectives. The answers provide further insight into the related issue or question. We have&#xD;
      designed a very simple approach with 2-3 open-ended questions for both patient and&#xD;
      practitioner. See Appendix D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.0 OVERALL STUDY DESIGN AND PLAN 3.1 Study Design Randomized paired comparison design,&#xD;
      conducted at a single centre, the London Regional Cancer Program (LRCP), Ontario, Canada. A&#xD;
      total of 47 patients will be accrued for this study. Eligible patients will be contacted and&#xD;
      study details will be reviewed with them. The schedule for BF will be two times per week&#xD;
      throughout the duration of radiation therapy. Each BF treatment will be applied immediately&#xD;
      before radiation treatment by the radiation therapist using a film template. The template is&#xD;
      a cellophane sheet with two quadrants physically removed. The quadrants removed will be&#xD;
      randomly selected to receive the film spray treatment. The template is used only at the time&#xD;
      of BF application. Other quadrants may receive standard treatment. No placebos will be used.&#xD;
      To ensure the template is placed at the correct location for each treatment, localization&#xD;
      will use the permanent tattoos used for radiation treatment localization. This is an&#xD;
      intention-to-treat trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1.1 Baseline/Accrual (Visit 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a histopathologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of breast cancer&#xD;
      scheduled to receive adjuvant radiation therapy may be screened. The following&#xD;
      procedures/assessments will take place during this visit for the patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obtaining written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reviewing inclusion/exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obtaining disease history, including date of first diagnosis, and the history of the&#xD;
           course of the patient's histopathologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of&#xD;
           breast cancer, and information about prior radiation or chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obtaining medical history (past or concurrent clinically significant disease(s))&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obtaining demographic data including history of radiation sensitivity or radiation&#xD;
           sensitizers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obtaining information about any planned treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perform a general physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A patient who meets all eligibility criteria will be enrolled in the study and the&#xD;
           following additional procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Completion of questionnaire for STAT, modified RTOG visual assessment of erythema,&#xD;
           qualitative questionnaire and QLQ-C30&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assign two of four regions by random number list&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1.2 Treatment Phase (Weekly assessment)&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the Baseline visit, patients will return to the study site for scheduled follow-up&#xD;
      visits, also called Patient Review (PR). The following procedures/assessments will be&#xD;
      performed during these visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation and documentation of any grade radiation dermatitis using STAT and the&#xD;
           modified RTOG erythema scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Documentation of any new medication use including use of skin creams&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1.3 Follow-up Visit (One week post treatment completion)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following procedures/assessments will be performed during the follow-up visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation and documentation of any grade radiation dermatitis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Completion of questionnaire for QLQ-C30&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Completion of qualitative questions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Completion of global questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.0 SELECTION OF STUDY POPULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in patients with histopathologically or cytologically confirmed&#xD;
      diagnosis of breast cancer, scheduled to receive adjuvant radiation therapy as outpatients at&#xD;
      the London Health Sciences Centre, London, Ontario.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.0 STATISTICAL EVALUATION 5.1 Determination of Sample Size The primary endpoint will be a&#xD;
      comparison of region 1 (region treated with standard care) and region 2 (region treated with&#xD;
      BF). Based on the same endpoint measure, we estimate the baseline/standard care risk of grade&#xD;
      2 toxicity and higher to be approximately 60% at any point during the assessment period.&#xD;
      Studies with the same and similar products demonstrate an expected reduction of grade 2 or&#xD;
      higher toxicity to approximately 30%. This is also a clinically important significant&#xD;
      difference . The sample size required is 42 (paired analysis). This assumes a Type I error of&#xD;
      0.05 and a power of 80% to reject the null hypothesis. With an expected 5% excess added due&#xD;
      to loss to follow up or non-evaluable data, we would require a sample size of 47 patients.&#xD;
      This is consistent with landmark Uppsala randomized study demonstrating the value of&#xD;
      corticosteroid cream with 42 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.2 Statistical Analysis SAS (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was used to generate a random&#xD;
      allocation list with two stratification blocks (i. chemo no chemo; ii. breast separation).The&#xD;
      physician will be unaware of the treatment allocation, but the patient and radiation&#xD;
      therapist administering the film will not be blinded. For qualitative measures, McNemar's&#xD;
      (McNemar) chi-square test for paired proportions will be used. For quantitative measures, a&#xD;
      paired t-test or a signed rank test will be used. For the 'time to event' variables that will&#xD;
      be paired, Kaplan Meier estimates to graphically demonstrate the 'time to event' will be&#xD;
      used. The statistical comparisons will be performed using proportional hazards models with a&#xD;
      sandwich estimator to account for the pairing with a sandwich estimator. A repeated measures&#xD;
      ANOVA will be used to assess the four quadrants. If the data is poorly distributed then we&#xD;
      will take a median of the two treated areas and two control areas and apply a singed rank&#xD;
      test. Note that this is not the principle endpoint of the trial. The principle endpoint of&#xD;
      the trial is a 1-to-1 comparison of the BF treated area and the area treated using standard&#xD;
      options. A multivariable analysis will be performed to determine factors impacting on skin&#xD;
      toxicity. The multivariable analysis will not be used for between patient comparisons as&#xD;
      differences will be accounted for by the pairing. All significant tests will be two-sided and&#xD;
      performed at the 5% level.&#xD;
