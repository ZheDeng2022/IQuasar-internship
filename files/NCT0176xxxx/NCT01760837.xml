  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on the current knowledge, the investigators hypothesized that most children with milk&#xD;
      allergy in Israel would be able to ingest baked milk products daily, thus benefiting from&#xD;
      improved nutrition and dietary variety and protect them from accidental exposure to&#xD;
      milk-containing products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The aim of our study is to examine the outcome of cow's milk allergic patients who&#xD;
      incorporated baked milk products into their diets. In order to recruit a large population, a&#xD;
      multicenter study across many hospital related allergy clinics in Israel will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants The study protocol is essentially as described previously (12). Subjects will be&#xD;
      recruited from the relevant allergy clinics involved in this project. The study will be&#xD;
      approved by the local Institutional Review Board, and informed consent will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be aged 1 to 18 years, had positive skin prick test (SPT) responses or&#xD;
      detectable serum milk-specific IgE, and had a history of an allergic reaction to milk within&#xD;
      6 months before study entry or milk-specific IgE levels or SPT responses greater than 95% of&#xD;
      predicted value for clinical reactivity (if &lt;2 years old, a level &gt;5 kUA/L; if &gt;2 years old,&#xD;
      a level &gt;15 kUA/L; SPT mean wheal diameter, &gt;8 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria include a negative SPT response and an undetectable milk-specific IgE&#xD;
      level; a history of anaphylaxis requiring intensive care unit hospitalization; unstable&#xD;
      asthma or a history of intubation related to asthma; previously diagnosed milk-induced&#xD;
      eosinophilic gastroenteropathy; a recent reaction (within 6 months) to a baked milk product;&#xD;
      or pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active group - Based on the results of the initial baked milk oral challenge, subjects will&#xD;
      be categorized as baked milk reactive or baked milk tolerant (group I and II, respectively).&#xD;
      Group I subjects will be instructed to completely avoid all forms of milk but will be offered&#xD;
      a repeat challenge 6 or more months from the initial challenge. Group II subjects will be&#xD;
      instructed to incorporate baked milk products daily into their diets and after 6 or more&#xD;
      months will be offered challenges to baked cheese products (pizza). Similarly, after 6 or&#xD;
      more months, baked cheese-tolerant children will be offered challenges to unheated milk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two groups will be followed at least 2 years and the outcome as well as other parameters&#xD;
      (accidental exposure, use of medication, quality of life, appearance of related symptoms,&#xD;
      ect) will be compared between the 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baked milk - Each muffin (or the equivalent piece of cake) contains ~ 1.3 g of milk protein.&#xD;
      The muffins/cake will be prepared according to instructed recipe and will be baked at 180&#xD;
      degree C for 30 minutes. Baked milk-tolerant subjects will be instructed to ingest 1 to 3&#xD;
      servings per day of store-bought baked milk products with milk listed as a minor ingredient&#xD;
      (third or less) or home-baked products with an equivalent amount of milk protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baked cheese - Cheese pizza (Maadanot), will be baked at 2200 C for 13 minutes or longer.&#xD;
      Baked cheese-tolerant subjects will be instructed to eat any brand of well-cooked cheese&#xD;
      pizza 4 to 7 times weekly and limited to 1 daily serving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unheated milk - Challenges will be performed with skim milk totaling 240 mL (or other product&#xD;
      containing 8-10 g of unheated milk protein, such as yogurt).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up allergy evaluations - Blood and serum samples will be collected for the measurement&#xD;
      of IgE and IgG4 antibodies to milk, casein, and b-lactoglobulin by using UniCAP (Phadia,&#xD;
      Uppsala, Sweden) as well as for T cell analyses. (This part is optional upon agreement of the&#xD;
      parents).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Un-blinded food challenges will be performed under a physician's supervision in the clinical&#xD;
      research unit. Muffin and pizza will be administered in 4 equal portions over 1 hour.&#xD;
      Unheated milk will be administered in gradually increasing doses. Subjects will be monitored&#xD;
      throughout and for 2 to 4 hours after completion of the challenge. Challenges will be&#xD;
      discontinued at the first objective sign of a reaction or due to convincing persistent&#xD;
      subjective symptoms, and appropriate treatment will be initiated immediately.&#xD;
