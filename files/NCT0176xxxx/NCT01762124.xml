  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this early feasibility study is to determine how a new transcatheter pulmonary&#xD;
      valve will move and perform once implanted in the right ventricular outflow tract.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Medtronic, Inc. is in the process of developing a novel transcatheter device option for&#xD;
      patients with congenital heart disease, without right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery conduits,&#xD;
      called the Native Outflow Tract Transcatheter Pulmonary Valve. Given limitations in the&#xD;
      animal model to confirm device boundary conditions, this feasibility study is proposed to&#xD;
      characterize that information as well as evaluate safety, procedural feasibility and&#xD;
      performance data to be used for future development of the device.&#xD;
