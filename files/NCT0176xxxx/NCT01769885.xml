    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies tivozanib before surgery in treating patients with localized&#xD;
      kidney cancer. Tivozanib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the growth&#xD;
      factors needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the feasibility of conducting a trial of tivozanib in the neoadjuvant setting of&#xD;
      localized (completely resectable) renal cell cancer (RCC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety of tivozanib in the neoadjuvant setting. II. To compare the tissue&#xD;
      before and after tivozanib for pharmacodynamic purposes (tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,&#xD;
      myeloid derived suppressor cells, necrosis in the primary tumor after exposure to tivozanib).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess the overall response rate of tivozanib in primary tumors and correlate the&#xD;
      radiographic changes, if any, to histo-pathological changes in the pathology specimen&#xD;
      post-nephrectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To compare the various growth factors (vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF],&#xD;
      interleukin-8 [IL-8], placenta growth factor [P1GF]) at baseline and post treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To assess the nephrectomy rate after applying neoadjuvant tivozanib in this primarily&#xD;
      resectable RCC population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive tivozanib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every&#xD;
      28 days for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 25 days&#xD;
      after completion of tivozanib, patients undergo curative nephrectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.&#xD;
