  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study we are looking at primary focal dystonias, including dystonias of the limbs,&#xD;
      eyes, jaw or face, neck, and vocal chords. This study will use magnet resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
      to see how the brain reacts while resting and doing a finger-tapping task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will test the hypothesis that disturbances in functional connectivity&#xD;
      within the motor, affective and cognitive basal ganglia networks in primary focal dystonia&#xD;
      (PFD) underlie the motor and non-motor symptoms in this disorder.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      After written consent is obtained, all subjects undergo a neurological examination by a board&#xD;
      certified neurologist and complete a Montreal Cognitive Assessment and Edinburgh Handedness&#xD;
      Inventory. Primary focal dystonia (PFD) patients will have their dystonia assessed with&#xD;
      commonly used clinical rating scales for dystonia using Unified Dystonia Rating&#xD;
      Scale,Fahn-Marsden Scale, Global Dystonia Rating Scale, Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis&#xD;
      Rating Scale-TWSTRS,and the Jankovic Rating Scale for blepharospasm. Patients and controls&#xD;
      will have affective symptoms assessed using the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale, Hospital&#xD;
      Anxiety and Depression Scale,Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale,and Beck Depression&#xD;
      Inventory. Clinical evaluations will be performed at the University of Colorado Denver and&#xD;
      Denver Veterans Affairs (VA) Hospital Brain Imaging Center on the Anschutz Medical Campus,&#xD;
      prior to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanning. Consenting, exam, and clinical scale&#xD;
      assessments are estimated to take 30-40 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI scanning protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI scanning will be performed using an 8-channel head coil and a 3 Tesla General Electric&#xD;
      (GE) Signa MR scanner system that is FDA-approved for clinical MR scanning. The principal&#xD;
      investigator and/or a co-investigator will be present for every scanning session. Head motion&#xD;
      will be minimized using cushions and passive restraints. The total MRI scanning session will&#xD;
      take approximately 50-60 minutes, including set-up time and scan time, and includes the&#xD;
      following MRI runs:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Anatomic scans: A high-resolution 3D spoiled gradient echo T1-weighted image (~8&#xD;
           minutes) will be collected for image registration and normalization. The subject simply&#xD;
           rests while the sequence is run. A diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scan (~10 minutes)&#xD;
           will be acquired using a double spin-echo diffusion echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence&#xD;
           and 32 diffusion directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Resting-state task (~6 min): Subject remains motionless with eyes closed and tries not&#xD;
           to sleep or think of anything in particular.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Motor tapping task (~6 min): Subject performs a sequential five-finger finger-tapping&#xD;
           sequence in 30 sec blocks that alternate with 30 sec of rest. The tapping task was&#xD;
           designed to minimize variance in performance between and within individuals and so is&#xD;
           paced with an audible cue. During the rest condition the subject is to remain motionless&#xD;
           and not think of anything in particular. A similar motor task has been shown to be&#xD;
           feasible in primary dystonia (PD) patients and lead to striatal dopamine release.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Repeat of motor task functional Magnetic Resonance Imagine (fMRI) scan (~6 minutes) -&#xD;
           subject uses opposite hand to perform sequential finger tapping task, but otherwise scan&#xD;
           is identical to above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Behavioral assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Button presses during finger-tapping task scanning will be recorded using an&#xD;
           MRI-compatible five-button response unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Surface electromyographic (EMG) recordings will be obtained during resting-state and&#xD;
           motor task fMRI scans to assess spontaneous dystonic motor activity, movement during&#xD;
           rest, and muscle activity during tapping. Simultaneous EMG monitoring will be performed&#xD;
           using a EMG Amplifier designed for fMRI acquisition and small adhesive pad EMG&#xD;
           electrodes taped to the skin.&#xD;
