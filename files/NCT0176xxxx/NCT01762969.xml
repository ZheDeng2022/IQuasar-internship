  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will check the feasibility of using early molecular response for making&#xD;
      treatment decisions. Patients diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia will commence imatinib&#xD;
      treatment. After 3 months of treatment their response will be assessed. If molecular response&#xD;
      would be less the 10% (BCR-ABL1/ABL ISI &gt;10%)imatinib therapy will be stopped and patients&#xD;
      will start a different TKI (as nilotinib, dasatinib). The investigators will follow on lab&#xD;
      and clinical outcomes.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To establish a national protocol for the treatment of patients with CML. Patients will be&#xD;
      stratified by molecular response, and treatment will be adjusted accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes To compare clinical outcomes of patients at high risk (transcript level&#xD;
      above 10%) to those at low risk (&lt;10%) while using the early switch approach To evaluate the&#xD;
      prognostic value of EUTOS, HASFORD, and SOKAL scores using the early switch strategy Patients&#xD;
      Patients may be enrolled to the protocol prior to any TKI treatment or at any time point from&#xD;
      commencement of imatinib (started at 400 mg daily) and prior to 3 months assessment, if all&#xD;
      the necessary baseline data is available, and all other inclusion criteria are met (patients&#xD;
      will be excluded if they received treatment with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor other than&#xD;
      imatinib)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Adult patients within 6 months after the diagnosis of Philadelphia chromosome-positive&#xD;
           CML in the chronic phase&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. who were not previously treated (with the exception of hydroyurea) for CML or&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. who were treated with imatinib for CML for up to 3 months, and prior to 3 months&#xD;
                assessment (patients will be excluded if they received treatment with a tyrosine&#xD;
                kinase inhibitor other than imatinib).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Age &gt; 18 years Diagnosis of CML will be made by conventional cytogenetic (chromosome&#xD;
           banding analysis) and/or interphase fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of&#xD;
           bone marrow containing at least one Philadelphia chromosome-positive metaphase cell. If&#xD;
           BCR-ABL1 fusion gene (Philadelphia chromosome) is not detected by conventional&#xD;
           cytogenetic analysis, the diagnosis of CML can be confirmed based on FISH analysis or&#xD;
           molecular analysis (demonstration of bcr-abl by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion of patients with any organ dysfunction (cardiac, renal, respiratory, liver) can be&#xD;
      done based on the decision of the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be excluded if they received treatment with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor other&#xD;
      than imatinib (i.e., nilotinib, dasatinib) before study entry. Patients may take hydroxyurea&#xD;
      or anagrelide for up to 4 weeks prior to imatinib treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions Imatinib 400 mg once daily Response will be assessed after 3 months of therapy.&#xD;
      A complete blood count to assess hematologic response and a bone marrow biopsy and/or&#xD;
      aspirate, including cytogenetic analysis and molecular analysis for quantitative RT-PCR for&#xD;
      BCR-ABL1/ABL will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Response assessment Assessment of response by molecular analysis of bcr-abl1 will be&#xD;
      performed in certified and standardized laboratories (a list of certified laboratories will&#xD;
      be distributed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patients has achieved CHR and BCR-ABL1/ABL ISI &lt;10% at 3 months then imatinib will be&#xD;
      continued at the dose of 400 mg daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient has achieved CHR and BCR-ABL1/ABL ISI &gt;10% at 3 months then imatinib will be&#xD;
      stopped and nilotinib 300 mg twice daily or dasatinib 100 mg once daily will be instituted.&#xD;
      ECG will be done prior to any change of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mutation analysis is recommended prior to the commencement of nilotinib or dasatinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will continue to receive the study treatment until the disease will progress or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxic effects will developed. In the event of disease progression or the&#xD;
      occurrence of adverse event treatment can be stopped or changed under the discretion of the&#xD;
      treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes Rate of CCyR at 12 months CCyR is defined as absence of Ph-positive metaphases,&#xD;
      determined on the basis of G-banding in at least 20 cells in metaphase per bone marrow sample&#xD;
      Overall survival Rate of major molecular response at 6, 12, 18, 24 months Cumulative rate of&#xD;
      optimal response at 12, 18 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      PFS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time from commencement of imatinib till meeting ELN criteria for failure, progression to&#xD;
      AP/BC, or death from any cause&#xD;
&#xD;
      EFS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time from commencement of imatinib till meeting ELN criteria for failure, progression to&#xD;
      AP/BC, grade 3 to 4 adverse event, drug discontinuation (except of the change of imatinib at&#xD;
      3 months according to molecular response), or death from any cause&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events will be classified according to the CTCAE NCI US v.3.0 Severe AE&#xD;
