  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the efficacy, carbidopa dose response and&#xD;
      safety of ODM-101, a new combination of levodopa, carbidopa and entacapone in the treatment&#xD;
      of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with end-of-dose motor fluctuations.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, crossover, multicentre,&#xD;
      phase II proof of concept study in patients with PD and end-of-dose motor fluctuations. The&#xD;
      patient's individually optimised daily levodopa regimen must be kept stable for at least 2&#xD;
      weeks before randomisation. The patients will be randomised to receive ODM-101 with 65 mg of&#xD;
      carbidopa, ODM-101 with 105 mg of carbidopa and Stalevo® according to a 3-period crossover&#xD;
      design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of a screening period, 3 treatment periods and a post-treatment period.&#xD;
      For each patient,there will be 9 visits: a screening visit performed 7-28 days before&#xD;
      randomisation, a randomisation visit (visit 1), 6 visits during the 3 treatment periods (i.e.&#xD;
      2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 weeks after randomisation and the start of the study treatment; visits&#xD;
      2-7), and an end-of-study visit 7-21 days after the last visit of the last treatment period.&#xD;
      The duration of study will be 14-23 weeks for each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients switch to study drugs after all assessments have been done at visit 1. The&#xD;
      strength of the levodopa in the study drug is determined by the patient's individually&#xD;
      optimised levodopa regimen before randomisation. During the first 2 weeks of each treatment&#xD;
      period, the patient's levodopa strength (but not frequency) in the study drug will be&#xD;
      adjusted as necessary by the investigator. For the remaining 2 weeks of each treatment&#xD;
      period, the levodopa strengths should be kept stable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unscheduled visits maybe performed during the first 2 weeks of each treatment period, if&#xD;
      there is a need to adjust the levodopa strength. In case the patient has not contacted the&#xD;
      study centre within a week after the start of the treatment period, the study personnel will&#xD;
      phone the patient to ensure that the symptoms and possible adverse events (AEs) are&#xD;
      sufficiently controlled and captured, and to assess the need to adjust the levodopa&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
