  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laboratory studies suggest that the study drug may stop cancer cells from growing by&#xD;
      affecting an interaction between proteins in the cells referred to as cAMP-response&#xD;
      element-binding protein and ß-catenin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research study is to determine the highest safe dose of study drug that&#xD;
      may be used when it is given together with a chemotherapy drug to patients with cancer of the&#xD;
      pancreas.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      PRI-724 is a small molecule antagonist that binds to the co-activator CBP thereby&#xD;
      specifically inhibiting the subset of Wnt/β-catenin-driven genes that are up-regulated in&#xD;
      cancer cells. PRI-724 is being developed as a potential antineoplastic agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the safety, tolerability, dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), and maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose (MTD) of sequential escalating doses per cohort of PRI-724 administered in combination&#xD;
      with gemcitabine to patients with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas that is locally advanced,&#xD;
      metastatic, or otherwise inoperable, who are candidates for second-line therapy after failing&#xD;
      first-line therapy with FOLFIRINOX (i.e., folinic acid [leucovorin], fluorouracil,&#xD;
      irinotecan, oxaliplatin)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PRI-724: 320, 640, 905 mg/m2/day, continuous intravenous (CIV) infusion over 24 h, daily&#xD;
           × 7 days, 1 week on with 1 week recovery × 2 (4 weeks equals 1 cycle)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gemcitabine: 1000 mg/m2 IV over 30 minutes; 3 weeks on with 1 week recovery (4 weeks&#xD;
           equals 1 cycle)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with documented, measurable or evaluable adenocarcinoma of the pancreas that is&#xD;
      locally advanced, metastatic, or otherwise inoperable, who are candidates for second-line&#xD;
      therapy after failing first-line therapy with FOLFIRINOX, will be entered into this phase 1b,&#xD;
      multicenter, open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation per cohort study. The trial is&#xD;
      designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, DLT(s), and MTD of escalating doses of&#xD;
      PRI-724, a CBP/ β- catenin inhibitor, when administered in combination with a standard dose&#xD;
      of gemcitabine. Correlative studies include characterization of the PK profiles of PRI-724&#xD;
      and gemcitabine, evaluation of the utility of potential PD markers of PRI-724 activity, as&#xD;
      well as preliminary assessment of the antineoplastic activity of PRI-724 plus gemcitabine in&#xD;
      this patient population.&#xD;
