      Main objective: to observationally assess the efficacy of different antimicrobials in&#xD;
      Bloodstream Infection (BSI) due to Enterobacteriaceae producing ESBLs or carbapenemases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bacteraemic infections due to ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To demonstrate that β-lactam/β-lactam inhibitors are not associated with worse cure rate&#xD;
           and mortality than carbapenems after controlling for confounders, both as empirical and&#xD;
           definitive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To demonstrate that fluoroquinolones as definitive therapy are not associated with worse&#xD;
           cure rate and mortality than carbapenems after controlling for confounders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To demonstrate that empirical cephalosporins in monotherapy are associated with worse&#xD;
           cure rate and mortality than carbapenems after controlling for confounders in infections&#xD;
           others than urinary tract infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To demonstrate that the association of active aminoglycosides with cephalosporins or&#xD;
           fluoroquinolines is not associated with worse cure rate and mortality than carbapenems&#xD;
           after controlling for confounders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To demonstrate that combination empirical and definitive therapy is not associated with&#xD;
           better cure rate than monotherapy after controlling for confounders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For tigecycline, colistin, and fosfomycin, no hypothesis. The objective is to provide&#xD;
           adjusted estimations of their association with outcome variables in comparison with&#xD;
           carbapenem monotherapy according to clinical situation and infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bacteraemic infections due to carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To demonstrate that combination therapy is associated with worse cure rate and mortality&#xD;
           than monotherapy after controlling for confounders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To show that carbapenems are associated with worse cure rate and mortality when used in&#xD;
           infections other than urinary tract caused by isolates showing MIC &lt;2 µg/mL for imipenem&#xD;
           or meropenem in comparison to those caused by isolates with higher MIC, after&#xD;
           controlling for confounders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To show that colistin used at a dose &gt;6 million IU per day is associated with improved&#xD;
           outcomes in comparison with lower dose, after controlling for confounders.&#xD;

      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: multicentre, international retrospective cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sites: multiple expert investigators from different countries are invited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conditions to fulfil to participate include availability of a database with the required data&#xD;
      or ability to retrospectively collect the data in a timely manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant centres are asked to include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Previously published cases: all these cases should be included if possible. The fact&#xD;
           that the case had been previously published should be specified in the database.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Additionally, participants are asked to include consecutive episodes detected by&#xD;
           reviewing their databases (clinical, infection control or microbiological records) from&#xD;
           January 2004 to June 2012, according to the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  For ESBL producers:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimum of 20 and a maximum of 50 cases should be included from each centre (the more&#xD;
      recent ones should be selected).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cases for which the enzyme is characterised at least to group level by polymerase chain&#xD;
           reaction, PCR, (it is, CTX-M, SHV, TEM) should be prioritised despite the date of&#xD;
           diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If not enough number of cases with PCR-characterized enzymes are available, or&#xD;
           PCR-characterisation has not been performed, the total number of cases should be&#xD;
           completed by including cases in which ESBL-production was identified using a standard&#xD;
           phenotypic method.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  For carbapenemase-producers: only cases in which the carbapenemase was&#xD;
                characterised by PCR should be included. All episodes up to a limit of 50 cases per&#xD;
                centre may be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, to avoid selection biases, consecutive cases according to previous criteria should&#xD;
      be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables&#xD;
&#xD;
      A common online database has been designed. Individual access to the database will be&#xD;
      provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcome variable: Cure rate at day 14&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome variables: Mortality at 72 hours, 7, 14 and 30 days, clinical improvement&#xD;
      at 72 hours, clinical cure at day 28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Explanatory variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severity of chronic underlying conditions: McCabe and Charlson index&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acute severity of underlying disease: Pitt score during the the day before BSI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type of acquisition&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Source of BSI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severity of SIRS at presentation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Microorganism, betalactamase, MICs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Empirical therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Definitive therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of data. Data will be approved and signed by the responsible investigator in each&#xD;
      center. All data will be centrally reviewed; queries will be sent for lacking data and those&#xD;
      showing inconsistencies or discrepancies. Data will be analysed per center; those with data&#xD;
      showing significant differences with the average will be requested for review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Plan&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subcohorts with patients treated with the treatment to be compared will be selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A propensity score to receive the 2 treatment types to compare will be calculated by&#xD;
           obtaining a non-parsimonious multivariate model by logistic regression in which the&#xD;
           outcome variable will be the treatment type. The explanatory variables will include age,&#xD;
           gender, center, type of ward, acquisition, Charlson index, Pitt score, severity of SIRS&#xD;
           and source.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After univariate analysis, multivariate analysis to investigate the adjusted association&#xD;
           of treatment type with the main and secondary outcome variables will be performed by&#xD;
           using logistic regression (for clinical response at day 14) and by Cox regression for&#xD;
           mortality. If time until death is unavailable, logistic regression will be used for&#xD;
           30-day mortality. Logistic regression will also be used for 72-hour and 30-day clinical&#xD;
           response. The propensity score will be added in all cases; also, Charlson score, Pitt&#xD;
           score, severity of SIRS and source will be added. Finally, interaction between treatment&#xD;
           type and source classified as urinary tract and others will be included.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Episode of clinically-significant monomicrobial BSI due to ESBL or&#xD;
             carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, including community and nosocomial ones.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For ESBL-producers, detection by standard phenotypic method as recommended by&#xD;
                  CLSI is enough (although PCR-based characterisation is preferred, see below).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For carbapenemase-producers, characterisation by at least PCR is necessary&#xD;
                  (isolates in which carbapenemase production is suspected based on antimicrobial&#xD;
                  susceptibility profile plus phenotypic tests alone is not acceptable, see below).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subsequent episodes in a patient caused by the same microorganism may be included if&#xD;
             the interval between them is &gt;3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No age limits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Polymicrobial or non-clinically significant episodes. Episodes in which a potential&#xD;
             contaminant (e.g., coagulase-negative staphylococci) is isolated only in one set of&#xD;
             blood cultures and there is not a typical source of infection for that kind of&#xD;
             organism (e.g. catheter-related) may be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unavailability of key data (such cases should be counted to analyse a potential&#xD;
             selection bias)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Episode occurring before January 2004.&#xD;
