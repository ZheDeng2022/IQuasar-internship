    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients typically experience a significant loss of muscle. In&#xD;
      healthy individuals, food supplementation with creatine (Cr) increases muscle size and&#xD;
      improves physical function and quality of life. The aim of this study is to investigate&#xD;
      whether RA patients may benefit similarly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      50 participants will be given a food supplement to take for 12 weeks; this supplement will&#xD;
      either be creatine or a placebo (a regular fruit flavoured powder that has no benefits).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over 12 weeks, body fat and muscle size (body composition), physical function, and fitness&#xD;
      (aerobic capacity of the heart and lungs to transport oxygen to the exercising muscles) will&#xD;
      be tested. In addition, quality of life questionnaires will be completed, disease activity&#xD;
      will be assessed and blood samples will be taken. Muscle samples (muscle biopsy) will be&#xD;
      obtained, from those who volunteer to provide them, at baseline and post-treatment.&#xD;

      Background and aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients typically experience a significant loss of muscle. This&#xD;
      reduces their ability to complete daily tasks and increases disability, as well as increasing&#xD;
      the risk to infection and other illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise is most effective for increasing muscle size and strength, but it is time consuming,&#xD;
      expensive and hard work, meaning uptake is poor. So, widely acceptable alternatives are&#xD;
      required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to test a food supplement called creatine. Creatine, often found in meat and&#xD;
      fish, make up an essential part of the systems that provide energy to the muscles for&#xD;
      movement and exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The creatine will be provided as a fruit flavoured powder that participants will mix with&#xD;
      water and drink, much like a fruit squash. In healthy individuals, food supplementation with&#xD;
      creatine (Cr) increases muscle size and improves physical function and quality of life. The&#xD;
      aim of this study is to investigate whether RA patients may benefit similarly&#xD;
&#xD;
      Who are the participants?&#xD;
&#xD;
      50 patients with who have stable and controlled RA, are over age 18, with no known kidney&#xD;
      problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What does the study involve?&#xD;
&#xD;
      50 participants will be given a food supplement to take for 12 weeks; this supplement will&#xD;
      either be creatine or a placebo (a regular fruit flavoured powder that has no benefits).&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly allocated to a group and will not be told which supplement they&#xD;
      are taking until the end of the trial. The supplement will be taken as a drink 4 times a day&#xD;
      for the first 5 days, and then once a day for the remainder of the 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to attend Bangor University 4 times to have a series of tests&#xD;
      done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The four testing points are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. before they start supplementation&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. after the 5 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. at completion of the 12-weeks of supplementation&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. 12 weeks after completion of the 12 week supplementation period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At all four testing points (1-4) body fat and muscle size (body composition), physical&#xD;
      function, and fitness (aerobic capacity of the heart and lungs to transport oxygen to the&#xD;
      exercising muscles) will be tested. In addition, quality of life questionnaires will be&#xD;
      completed, disease activity will be assessed and blood samples will be taken. Muscle samples&#xD;
      (muscle biopsy) will be obtained, from those who volunteer to provide them, at baseline and&#xD;
      post-treatment (test points 1 and 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body fat and muscle size (body composition) will be assessed using type of X-ray called&#xD;
      'dual-entry X-ray absorptiometry' (DXA) scans and by looking at body water levels. DXA allows&#xD;
      the research team to estimate the amount of lean tissue (muscle) and fat that is in the body.&#xD;
      The scan is completely painless.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical function will be assessed using the following tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. strength tests of the knee muscles and hand-grip&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the Up-and-Go Test (UG) - For the UG, participants are required rise from a seated&#xD;
           position on a fixed chair, walk forward to a cone placed 8ft (2.44 m) away, and return&#xD;
           to the chair and a seated position.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. the sit-to-stand in 30 sec test (SST-30) - For the SST-30 participants will rise from&#xD;
           the same seated position as during the UG as many times as possible in 30 s whilst&#xD;
           keeping their arms folded across the chest.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. 50-ft walk test - During the 50-ft walk test, time taken to complete the walk along a&#xD;
           straight line marked by cones is recorded&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To assess fitness participants will complete a step test. During the test participants&#xD;
           are required to step up and down a 10-inch step at a tempo controlled by a metronome for&#xD;
           three x three-minute stages or until the target heart rate (65% of predicted maximum&#xD;
           heart rate) is achieved. This test will normally last 3 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
      What are the potential risks and benefits?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks - A disadvantage of taking part is the time commitment required to participate in the&#xD;
      study. Whilst taking the supplement drink will be quick and simple, there are 4 testing&#xD;
      sessions which may 2 hours in which participants must attend at Bangor University. Any travel&#xD;
      expenses participants incur for participating in this study will be paid for.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Creatine supplementation will cause some weight gain; in the short-term this is due to water&#xD;
      retention by the muscle and in the long-term this is due to an increase in muscle size.&#xD;
      Previous research, including research with RA patients, has found no adverse side effects&#xD;
      that can be linked to the creatine supplementation. There are anecdotal reports of creatine&#xD;
      supplementation causing muscle cramps, stomach and heart problems; however no evidence has&#xD;
      ever linked these directly to the creatine itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is also a slight possibility that the muscle biopsy site (where the muscle is taken)&#xD;
      could bruise and be sore but this is quite rare and in fact most people report only a short&#xD;
      term slight ache after the biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is also an exposure to radiation (emission of energy) from the DXA scan, though this is&#xD;
      only a small amount. However, because of this radiation pregnant women are not allowed to&#xD;
      part in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits - Taking creatine supplements will increase muscle strength and improve physical&#xD;
      function and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive creatine supplementation regardless of which group they are&#xD;
      initially put into. Participants will also be informed about their fitness levels and will&#xD;
      receive advice on how to improve these.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard DXA can inform the investigaters of a disease in the bone that can increase the&#xD;
      risk of fractures (osteoporosis) that patients might not know they had.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Who is running the study and how long will it last? The study will commence in January 2012&#xD;
      and is being undertaken by the School of Sport, Health and Exericse Sciences (SSHES) at&#xD;
      Bangor University, Wales, in association with the Rheumatology department at Ysbyty Gwynedd&#xD;
      Hospital, Bangor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Who is funding the study? The study is being funded by Betsi Cadwalader University Health&#xD;
      Board. The study is expected to finish within an 18 month time frame, with recruiting open&#xD;
      for a year or until 50 patients have been found.&#xD;
