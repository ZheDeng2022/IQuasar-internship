  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of the addition of sitagliptin&#xD;
      (administered as MK-0431A or MK-0431A XR) relative to the addition of placebo on glycated&#xD;
      hemoglobin (A1C), and the safety and tolerability of the addition of sitagliptin, in&#xD;
      pediatric participants (ages 10-17 years) with type 2 diabetes mellitus with inadequate&#xD;
      glycemic control on metformin therapy (alone or in combination with insulin). The primary&#xD;
      hypothesis is that the addition of sitagliptin reduces glycated hemoglobin (A1C) more than&#xD;
      the addition of placebo after 20 weeks of treatment.&#xD;

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The study recruited participants in clinics/clinical offices in 28 countries.&#xD;
One participant who was randomized to the arm &quot;Sitagliptin/Metformin&quot; withdrew prior to treatment, then was re-randomized into the study. Only the second randomization is counted for Participant Flow and All-Cause Mortality, so this participant is not counted twice.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The Pre-Assignment Period included a one-week single-blind placebo run-in prior to randomization during which participants received metformin with sitagliptin/metformin placebo or metformin XR with sitagliptin/metformin XR placebo each day.</pre_assignment_details>

          <population>The analysis population includes all randomized participants who received ≥1 dose of study medication and continued in the study beyond Week 20 without initiating glycemic rescue therapy before Week 20. As defined in the protocols, these analyses were on participants pooled from protocols MK-0431A-170 and -289, pooled by receipt of drug or placebo.</population>
