  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HF represents a major burden in the developed world. Mortality and rehospitalization rates&#xD;
      post-discharge in patients admitted with HF may be as high as 15%-30% within 60-90 days,&#xD;
      respectively. Given that rehospitalization drives much of the cost associated with HF, there&#xD;
      has been increased interest in predicting risk of rehospitalization as a means to control&#xD;
      health care costs. These risk stratification models can serve as important clinical tools by&#xD;
      helping to identify those patients who are at very high risk may be observed more closely or&#xD;
      treated more intensively. The most important predictors for the combined endpoint of death or&#xD;
      rehospitalization were admission serum creatinine concentration, systolic blood&#xD;
      pressure,admission hemoglobin level, discharge use of ACE-Ior ARBS, and Pulmonary disease.&#xD;
      Other independent predictors during hospitalization of readmission and mortality included low&#xD;
      admission Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire score, high BNP, hyponatremia,&#xD;
      tachycardia, hypotension, absence of b-blocker therapy, and history of diabetes and&#xD;
      arrhythmias. Nevertheless, both models fail to provide the treating physician a simple&#xD;
      decision making tool for predicting which patient is stable enough to be discharged from the&#xD;
      hospital without a high risk of readmission. The Non Invasive Cardiac System (NICaS, Israel),&#xD;
      calculates the cardiac output by measuring impedance cardiography in a tetra-polar mode,&#xD;
      derived from electrodes placed on both wrists or one wrist and the contra-lateral ankle. This&#xD;
      simple to operate, non-invasive technique was validated in a few studies to be reliable in&#xD;
      estimation of CO compared to traditional, invasive techniques in different settings including&#xD;
      HF patients. A previous study demonstrated that parameters derived from this system showed a&#xD;
      highly significant correlation to echo estimated EF and serum BNP in chronic HF patients and&#xD;
      were equally able to predict complications in this population. Aim:To assess whether the&#xD;
      NICaS system can identify high risk HF patient for readmission prior to their discharge&#xD;
      compared to serum BNP measurement.&#xD;

      readmission prior to their discharge compared to serum BNP measurement.Methods and&#xD;
      population:Known HF patients, admitted due to HF exacerbation, will be tested with NICaS&#xD;
      system in concordance with serum BNP measurement prior to their discharge from the hospital.&#xD;
      The decision for discharge will be made on clinical ground by the treating physician alone.&#xD;
      The patients will be tested by NICaS system in the following manner-patches will be attached&#xD;
      to both patient's wrists, or one wrist and contra-lateral ankle for a period of approximately&#xD;
      30 seconds. During that time the patient will be seated or supine.3cc of blood will be drawn&#xD;
      from peripheral vein for BNP level measurement.NICaS parameters and serum BNP levels will be&#xD;
      processed in an excel sheet. The patients will be followed by a telephone questionnaire after&#xD;
      3 months from discharge in order to document events of readmission or death.&#xD;
