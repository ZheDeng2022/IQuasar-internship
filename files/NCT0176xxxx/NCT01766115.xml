      To assess the safety and tolerability of the use of telaprevir in the setting of&#xD;
      post-exposure prophylaxis among HCW exposed to HCV genotype 1 or genotype 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the election rate of postexposure prophylaxis for HCV-related occupational&#xD;
      exposures in HCW.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At MGH and BWH, HCW exposed to blood or visibly bloody fluids are referred immediately to&#xD;
      Occupational Health Services. The person whose blood or body fluid is the source of an&#xD;
      occupational exposure should be evaluated for HBV, HCV, and HIV infection. Information&#xD;
      available in the medical record at the time of exposure, or from the source person, might&#xD;
      confirm or exclude bloodborne virus infection. If the HBV, HCV, and/or HIV infection status&#xD;
      of the source is unknown, the source patient should be informed of the incident and tested&#xD;
      for serologic evidence of bloodborne virus infection, including HBsAg, HCV antibody, and HIV&#xD;
      antibody. Reactive results by EIA for anti-HCV are confirmed by HCV RNA PCR, which is tested&#xD;
      using Roche COBAS TaqMan quantitative assay (Roche Molecular Systems) with a lower limit of&#xD;
      quantitation of &lt; 43 IU/ml. HCV RNA testing is performed twice weekly at MGH and BWH. In the&#xD;
      event that the source patient's HCV antibody is positive and the HCV RNA is below the lower&#xD;
      limit of detection, an HCV Recombinant Immunoblot Assay (RIBA) will be ordered: if the RIBA&#xD;
      is negative, then the positive HCV antibody is interpreted as a false positive result, and&#xD;
      the source patient is not infected with HCV. If the RIBA is positive, the source patient will&#xD;
      then receive serial HCV RNA testing&#xD;
&#xD;
      For HCW exposed to an HCV-positive source, HCV antibody testing is performed at the time of&#xD;
      exposure. Per standard practices recommended by Partners Occupational Health Services, HCV&#xD;
      RNA testing of HCW is not performed at the time of exposure, unless the HCV antibody test is&#xD;
      positive. For the current study, if a HCW meets inclusion criteria (specifically, has an&#xD;
      exposure through needlestick injury with a hollow-bore needle to a source patient who is&#xD;
      anti-HCV(+) and HCV RNA (+); and the HCW is anti-HCV Ab negative) and is interested in&#xD;
      enrolling in the study, HCV RNA testing of eligible HCW will be performed at the initial&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For potential study enrollment, patients will be directly referred from Partners Occupational&#xD;
      Health Services (BWH or MGH). They will be responsible for contacting study personnel by&#xD;
      pager. In the event that the exposure occurs after the Occupational Health Services office is&#xD;
      closed, the HCW will be evaluated in the Emergency Room as per standard protocol, and will be&#xD;
      referred to study personnel the following business day. The HCW will then be screened with an&#xD;
      interview in person, and patients with an appropriate exposure will be eligible for&#xD;
      inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study drug will be offered to subjects who were exposed to potentially HCV-infected blood&#xD;
      after needlestick injury with hollow-bore needles. Blood on intact skin is considered&#xD;
      low-risk and, therefore, treatment will not be recommended. Other unusual injuries/exposures&#xD;
      will be included on an individual basis by study physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the HCW signs informed consent to participate in the study, he/she will be offered a&#xD;
      prescription for PEP with telaprevir 750 mg three times per day for 4 weeks within a five (5)&#xD;
      day period from his/her exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telaprevir has been shown to interact with both HIV protease inhibitors and reverse&#xD;
      transcriptase inhibitors through their activity upon the CYP3A enzyme. With respect to the&#xD;
      interactions between telaprevir and HIV protease inhibitors, it is not recommended to&#xD;
      co-administer darunavir/ritonavir, fosamprenavir/ritonavir, or lopinavir/ritonavir with&#xD;
      telaprevir[19]. In addition, regarding the use of reverse transcriptase inhibitors,&#xD;
      concomitant administration of telaprevir and efavirenz resulted in reduced steady-state&#xD;
      exposures to telaprevir and efavirenz. Van Heeswijk et al conducted three open-label,&#xD;
      randomized cross-over trials among HIV and HCV negative healthy volunteers, and found that&#xD;
      therapeutic levels of telaprevir, efavirenz, and tenofovir were maintained when the&#xD;
      telaprevir dose was increased to 1250 mg three-times daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result of these interactions, in cases where a HCW is exposed to HCV and HIV and elects&#xD;
      to take HIV PEP, telaprevir will be offered for HCV PEP if one of the following HIV PEP&#xD;
      regimens is prescribed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Tenofovir/Emtricitabine (Truvada) + Atazanavir/Ritonavir&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Tenofovir/Emtricitabine (Truvada) + Raltegravir&#xD;
&#xD;
      All decisions regarding post-exposure prophylaxis for HCW exposed to HCV and HIV will be&#xD;
      discussed with the HIV/ID fellow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, for HCW who are HIV-infected and receiving HAART at the time of study&#xD;
      enrollment, discussions will be held between the study team and the Infectious Disease&#xD;
      specialist who is managing the HAART regimen of the HCW, in order to determine whether the&#xD;
      patient could safely take telaprevir for HCV PEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HCW will have anti-HCV testing performed, along with stored serum for lookbacks if&#xD;
      necessary, as is the current protocol in Occupational Health. In addition to the usual&#xD;
      laboratories drawn by occupational health (HCV antibody at week 0, HCV RNA at weeks 4 and&#xD;
      12), a blood count including differential will be required prior to consideration of study&#xD;
      drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At week 4, all enrolled patients will have quantitative HCV viral load testing (regardless of&#xD;
      treatment election). If HCV RNA is detectable, HCW will be referred to GI/Hepatology for&#xD;
      consideration of intensified antiviral therapy. If negative for patients in the treatment&#xD;
      arm, then telaprevir will be discontinued at this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At week 12 and 24, HCV RNA testing will be repeated. If positive, the patient will be&#xD;
      referred for intensified antiviral therapy. Week 24 HCV RNA testing is necessary to look for&#xD;
      the possibility that early prophylaxis with telaprevir delays the onset of hepatitis C&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
