  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim of the investigators' study is to evaluate one of the symptoms described by patients&#xD;
      affected with the so-called &quot;not-celiac wheat sensitivity&quot; (NCWS). NCWS patients may be&#xD;
      defined as ones, neither celiac or allergic to wheat, who develop symptoms following wheat&#xD;
      consumption and improve on Gluten Free Diet (GFD). Among these, patients often report the&#xD;
      appearance of bloating and abdominal pain, and, sometimes, swelling of fingers and face,&#xD;
      shortly after ingestion of wheat. They also refer that swelling tends to last for some hours&#xD;
      and then to disappear on GFD. To our knowledge, this disorder has never been investigated&#xD;
      neither proved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the investigators' research, the investigators selected adult patients, both genders,&#xD;
      affected with NCWS. Diagnostic criteria include: 1) symptoms disappearance on GFD, 2) testing&#xD;
      negative for celiac disease [anti-tTG and EMA, and with biopsy Marsh 0-1] and wheat allergy&#xD;
      [serum specific IgE for wheat], 3) positive response to a double-blind placebo-controlled&#xD;
      challenge (DBPC) with wheat or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited among subjects referring, as outpatients, to the Department of&#xD;
      Internal Medicine, 'Giovanni Paolo II' Hospital of Sciacca (Agrigento), and of Internal&#xD;
      Medicine of the University of Palermo, from January 2012 to October 2013. The investigators&#xD;
      will include patients referring for functional dyspepsia and/or irritable bowel syndrome&#xD;
      (IBS)-like symptoms. All recruited patients must report body's swelling immediately after&#xD;
      wheat ingestion. In all recruited patients, NCWS diagnosis was posed during the previous&#xD;
      years, according to the above mentioned criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients, all on GFD for at least 30 days, will undergo to another DBPC with wheat or placebo&#xD;
      (xylose), performed by administering capsules coded as A or B containing wheat or xylose,&#xD;
      respectively. Capsules A or B will be administered once, and then, after 1 week of washout,&#xD;
      patients received the other capsules, given once too. Before and 2 hours after every&#xD;
      challenge, patients will undergo a complete medical examination (measurement of body weight,&#xD;
      height, body mass index [BMI], waist circumference, diameter of thighs, legs, arms, and&#xD;
      fingers), and we will perform bioelectrical impedance analysis and collect blood sampling,&#xD;
      for identification of possible markers (bioelectrical, immunologic, hormonal, etc) that may&#xD;
      help to demonstrate and explain mechanisms of examined symptom.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gluten is the most important protein component of some grains, notably wheat, rye, and&#xD;
      barley, which are the basis for a variety of wheat-derived alimentary products consumed&#xD;
      throughout the world (bread, pasta, pizza etc). However the &quot;engineering&quot; of&#xD;
      gluten-containing grains created the conditions for human diseases related to gluten&#xD;
      exposure. These forms of gluten intolerance represent a heterogeneous set of conditions,&#xD;
      including celiac disease, wheat allergy and gluten sensitivity, that, combined, seems to&#xD;
      affect about 10% of the general population. The frequency of not-celiac gluten sensitivity is&#xD;
      however still unknown, even though it is possible that this condition have been undiagnosed&#xD;
      and under-diagnosed by the physicians for a long time. The immune responsiveness to wheat&#xD;
      antigens represents a complex process, and its establishment and maintenance are not&#xD;
      completely elucidated. The most frequent diseases caused by wheat ingestion are T&#xD;
      cell-mediated disorders, i.e. celiac disease and immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated allergic&#xD;
      reactions. However, besides celiac disease and wheat allergy, there are cases of gluten&#xD;
      reactions in which neither autoimmune nor IgE-mediated allergic mechanisms are involved.&#xD;
      These are generally defined as gluten sensitivity. Some subjects, who experience symptoms&#xD;
      when eating gluten-containing products and show improvement when following a gluten-free&#xD;
      diet, may have gluten sensitivity instead of celiac disease or wheat allergy. Gluten&#xD;
      sensitivity patients are unable to tolerate gluten and develop an adverse reaction when&#xD;
      eating gluten, that, usually, and differently from celiac disease, does not lead to small&#xD;
      intestinal damage. Gastrointestinal symptoms in gluten sensitivity patients may resemble&#xD;
      those associated with celiac disease, but the overall clinical picture is generally less&#xD;
      severe and is not accompanied by the occurrence of autoantibodies (i.e. anti-tissue&#xD;
      transglutaminase, tTG, or anti-endomysium, EMA) or autoimmune disease (i.e. Hashimoto's&#xD;
      thyroiditis). Typically, the diagnosis is made by exclusion, and an elimination diet and an&#xD;
      &quot;open challenge&quot; (i.e., the monitored reintroduction of gluten-containing foods) are most&#xD;
      often used to evaluate whether health improves or worsen with the elimination or&#xD;
      reintroduction of gluten in the diet, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As it is not known what cereals components determine the symptoms in the so called gluten&#xD;
      sensitivity patients, we prefer to define this condition as &quot;wheat sensitivity&quot; instead of&#xD;
      &quot;gluten sensitivity&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wheat sensitivity can cause both gastrointestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms; among the&#xD;
      latter, the patients often reported body's swelling (hands', fingers', arms' , face's&#xD;
      swelling).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has two major aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluation of the effective dependence from the wheat ingestion of the clinical&#xD;
           alterations presented by patients with diagnosed gluten sensitivity, with particular&#xD;
           attention to abdominal bloating and body's swelling. The study will be done after a&#xD;
           period of gluten-free diet (at least 30 days), using a double-blind placebo-controlled&#xD;
           challenge with wheat or placebo (xylose), performed by administering capsules coded as A&#xD;
           or B containing wheat or xylose, respectively. Capsules A or B will be administered&#xD;
           once, and then, after 1 week of washout, the patients received the other capsules, given&#xD;
           once too.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Before and 2 hours after every challenge, patients will undergo a complete medical&#xD;
           examination, and The investigators will perform bioelectrical impedance analysis and&#xD;
           collect blood sampling, for identification of possible markers that may be of help to&#xD;
           demonstrate and explain the mechanisms of the examined symptom.&#xD;
