      The purpose of this study is to determine whether sildenafil (Viagra®) is effective in&#xD;
      improving cerebral blood flow and cerebrovascular reactivity inpatients who have persistent&#xD;
      symptoms at least 6 months after a traumatic brain injury (TBI).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The goal of this Phase II study is to generate pilot data that will allow for the design of a&#xD;
      clinical trial of sildenafil (Viagra®) to treat patients with traumatic vascular injury in&#xD;
      the chronic state after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Injury to small and medium-sized blood&#xD;
      cerebral blood vessels is a well-recognized consequence of traumatic brain injury (TBI).&#xD;
      Non-invasive imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission&#xD;
      computerized tomography (SPECT) have long demonstrated deficits in cerebral blood flow in&#xD;
      TBI, including in symptomatic patients years after mild TBI (mTBI). Recently, magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI) methods have been developed which allow reliable and non-invasive&#xD;
      measurement of cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) to vasodilatory stimuli such as hypercapnia&#xD;
      in humans. These techniques have never been applied to symptomatic patients in the chronic&#xD;
      stage after mTBI. These methods are particularly promising due to the recent discovery that&#xD;
      phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitors improve cerebral blood flow, induce angiogenesis and&#xD;
      neurogenesis, and improve functional recovery in animals after experimental stroke and&#xD;
      cryoinjury. This pilot study will use novel MRI methods (Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD)&#xD;
      response to hypercapnia) to noninvasively measure cerebrovascular reactivity in the chronic&#xD;
      stage after TBI, and the first to use sildenafil in patients with chronic TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has one primary objective and 10 secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Single dose treatment with sildenafil (50 mg orally) is effective in increasing the&#xD;
           global BOLD response to hypercapnia in symptomatic patients in the chronic stage after&#xD;
           TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary objective (Safety and Tolerability):&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Sildenafil therapy (25 mg orally twice daily) is well tolerated in symptomatic patients&#xD;
           in the chronic stage after TBI, with few adverse effects and treatment discontinuations&#xD;
           in less than 10% of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Tertiary (Exploratory) objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Single dose treatment with sildenafil (50 mg orally) is effective in increasing the&#xD;
           regional BOLD response to hypercapnia in symptomatic patients in the chronic stage after&#xD;
           TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patients with persistent symptoms in the chronic stage after TBI have deficits in&#xD;
           cerebrovascular reactivity compared to uninjured healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patients with persistent symptoms in the chronic stage after TBI have deficits in&#xD;
           cerebrovascular reactivity compared to asymptomatic patients after TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Patients with persistent symptoms in the chronic stage after TBI have reduced numbers of&#xD;
           circulating EPCs compared to uninjured healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Patients with persistent symptoms in the chronic stage after TBI have reduced numbers of&#xD;
           circulating EPCs compared to asymptomatic patients after TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. The effect on cerebrovascular reactivity of single dose treatment with sildenafil&#xD;
           persists after 8 weeks of chronic therapy (25 mg orally, twice daily).&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Treatment with sildenafil for 8 weeks (25 mg orally twice daily) increases the number of&#xD;
           circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in symptomatic chronic TBI patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Treatment with sildenafil for 8 weeks (25 mg orally twice daily) reduces the prevalence&#xD;
           of post-concussive symptoms, compared to placebo treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Treatment with sildenafil for 8 weeks (25 mg orally twice daily) improves performance in&#xD;
           neuropsychometric tests, compared to placebo treatment.&#xD;
