      The primary objective of this study is to obtain safety data on the use of the ULTRABRAID&#xD;
      PLUS SUTURE, and to assess the preliminary effectiveness of the use of the ULTRABRAID PLUS&#xD;
      SUTURE in comparison to the ULTRABRAID SUTURE in patients undergoing rotator cuff repair.&#xD;

      The primary objective of this two-arm, randomized, single-blind pilot study is to obtain&#xD;
      safety data on the use of the ULTRABRAID Plus Suture and to assess the preliminary&#xD;
      effectiveness of the use of the ULTRABRAID Plus Suture in comparison to the ULTRABRAID Suture&#xD;
      in subjects undergoing rotator cuff repair. The primary endpoint of the 6-month postoperative&#xD;
      analysis is to assess rotator cuff integrity at 6 months, defined as the proportion of&#xD;
      subjects with a re-tear of the rotator cuff as measured by high-resolution ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      rotator cuff integrity at the other time points, as well as between arms (1, 3, 6 weeks and&#xD;
      3, 12 months); difference in tissue thickness and muscle atrophy using high-resolution&#xD;
      ultrasound between baseline (preoperative) and all postoperative time points (1, 3, 6 weeks&#xD;
      and 3, 6, 12 months); difference in tendon echogenicity and vascularity using Doppler&#xD;
      ultrasound between baseline (preoperative) and all postoperative time points (1, 3, 6 weeks&#xD;
      and 3, 6, 12 months); difference in Constant Shoulder Assessment score and Western Ontario&#xD;
      Rotator Cuff (WORC) Index between baseline (preoperative) and all postoperative time points&#xD;
      (1, 3, 6 weeks and 3, 6, 12 months); rehabilitation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  time to active-assisted rehab exercises&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  time to isometric rehab exercises&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  time to discontinuation of an arm sling lab results (C-Reactive Protein [CRP],&#xD;
           Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate [ESR] and Butyric Acid Levels) at 1, 3, and 6 weeks&#xD;
           postoperatively; adverse event (AE) rates (all categories).&#xD;
