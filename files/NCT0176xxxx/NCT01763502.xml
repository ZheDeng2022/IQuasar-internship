  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent evidence shows that early childhood is a critical period for investments in human&#xD;
      capital and that micronutrient deficiency and inadequate stimulation are major causes of&#xD;
      impaired child development in poor countries. These findings have increased interest in&#xD;
      promoting nutrition interventions and preschool participation during early childhood.&#xD;
      Transfers to households linked to preschool participation have the potential to improve&#xD;
      nutrition and cognitive outcomes in young children. Receipt of transfers may induce&#xD;
      improvements in diet quality and greater preschool participation, enhancing both nutrition&#xD;
      and stimulation. However, there is limited evidence on the impacts of such programs, all of&#xD;
      it from Latin America. There is also no evidence on the relative impact of different transfer&#xD;
      modalities linked to preschool participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a cluster-randomized controlled evaluation of a transfer program linked to&#xD;
      preschool participation. The transfer program, administered by the World Food Programme,&#xD;
      provides food or cash transfers to children aged 3-5 years enrolled in preschools at&#xD;
      baseline. The preschools, operating in the Karamoja sub-region of Uganda, are supported by&#xD;
      UNICEF and managed by District representatives of the Government of Uganda. The food&#xD;
      transfers consist of multiple-micronutrient-fortified corn soy blend (CSB), oil, and sugar,&#xD;
      totaling approximately 1200 calories per day per child and including 99% of iron&#xD;
      requirements. Cash transfers equal the estimated value of the food basket if purchased in the&#xD;
      market. Randomization into the food treatment, cash treatment or control was done across 98&#xD;
      preschools, referred to as Early Childhood Development (ECD) centers. The intervention period&#xD;
      was from February 2011 to May 2012 and included distribution of transfers on a&#xD;
      six-to-eight-week cycle. A longitudinal (panel) survey of households with children aged 3-5&#xD;
      years at baseline was conducted before exposure to the transfers and 18 months later. The&#xD;
      randomized design of this effectiveness study and the panel nature of the data allow for a&#xD;
      rigorous field trial in which impacts on nutrition and cognitive outcomes can be assessed and&#xD;
      compared across modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We examine the impacts of the two transfer modalities, cash transfers or&#xD;
      multiple-micronutrient-fortified food transfers, linked to preschool enrollment, on child&#xD;
      nutrition and cognitive development. In addition, we explore potential mechanisms through&#xD;
      intermediate impacts on food intake and participation in preschools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The key research objectives are to assess the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Impacts on targeted groups: Assess the effects of cash or food transfers on nutrition&#xD;
           and cognitive outcomes in children aged 3-5 years at baseline and explore pathways for&#xD;
           these effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Optimal program design: Assess the differential impacts of a program in which children&#xD;
           are provided multiple-micronutrient-fortified food transfers linked to preschool&#xD;
           enrollment compared with one in which they are given the equivalent value of cash&#xD;
           transfers linked to preschool enrollment.&#xD;

      Allocation: Randomized&#xD;
&#xD;
      This evaluation is conducted in communities surrounding Early Childhood Development (ECD)&#xD;
      centers in the Karamoja sub-region of Uganda, in Napak, Kotido, and Kaabong districts. The&#xD;
      catchment area of ECD centers serve as the clusters for randomization and analysis. After&#xD;
      stratifying ECD centers (by district for Napak and Kotido, and by sub-district for the more&#xD;
      spatially-diverse Kaabong), clusters were assigned to the treatment groups (FOOD, CASH and&#xD;
      CTRL) using block randomization, to ensure as equal a distribution of ECD centers across&#xD;
      treatment arms within each stratum as possible. Block randomization yielded 33 ECD centers in&#xD;
      the FOOD group, 32 centers in the CASH group, and 33 centers in the CTRL group. Subsequently&#xD;
      but prior to the start of the interventions, WFP re-assigned one CTRL center to FOOD, due to&#xD;
      its proximity to a nearby FOOD center, in order to avoid migration of children which posed&#xD;
      contamination concerns. WFP also re-assigned one CASH center to FOOD, because the cash&#xD;
      distribution systems required use of mobile phones, and mobile phone signals were not readily&#xD;
      available in the center's catchment area. The final assignment included 35 ECD centers in the&#xD;
      FOOD group, 31 centers in the CASH group, and 32 centers in the CTRL group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sample Selection and Sample Size: Prior to the baseline survey, power calculations were&#xD;
           conducted using existing data from Uganda on cognitive measures (Mullens scores) and&#xD;
           food security measures (share of food expenditures out of total expenditures) to&#xD;
           estimate the necessary sample size for detecting a minimum effect size of 10 percentage&#xD;
           points with 80 percent power. These calculations indicated a target minimum sample of 30&#xD;
           ECD centers per treatment arm and 20 households per ECD center. 98 ECD center clusters&#xD;
           were determined eligible for transfer receipt by WFP. ECD enrollment data collected in&#xD;
           August-September, 2010, were used to identify households with children ages 3-5 years&#xD;
           enrolled in these ECD centers. In each of the 98 ECD centers, out of all households with&#xD;
           children ages 3-5 years enrolled, roughly 25 households were selected at random for&#xD;
           inclusion in the baseline sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data Collection: The evaluation uses a longitudinal design, with the same households&#xD;
           interviewed at baseline (September-November, 2010, prior to start of the food or cash&#xD;
           program) and at endline (March-May, 2012). In the intervening months, treatment&#xD;
           households receive 15 months of exposure to the intervention. Direct assessments of&#xD;
           children's cognitive development, anthropometry, and hemoglobin levels are conducted in&#xD;
           a randomly-selected roughly 80% of sampled households in each cluster, due to field time&#xD;
           constraints. Cognitive development is assessed using a battery of test items drawn&#xD;
           primarily from the Mullen Scales of Early Learning, adapted by psychologists for the&#xD;
           Karamoja context. Anthropometry is measured following standard protocol using height&#xD;
           boards and weighing scales. Hemoglobin concentration is assessed using capillary blood&#xD;
           obtained by finger prick and read using a HemoCue® analyzer. Hemoglobin readings are&#xD;
           adjusted as necessary for the effects of varying altitude in the sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analysis: Differences in baseline characteristics are assessed using pairwise t-tests&#xD;
           and binomial probability tests. Analyses of impacts focus on outcomes for children age&#xD;
           3-5 years (36-71 months) at baseline, as well as for children aged 36-53 months at&#xD;
           baseline who remain in the targeted age range throughout the course of the intervention.&#xD;
           Intent to treat (ITT) effects are estimated using single-difference and ANCOVA&#xD;
           specifications on children at baseline and endline. Estimates are calculated using Stata&#xD;
           12; standard errors account for stratification and clustering in sampling and&#xD;
           assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics Review:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Side Effects: Potential risks from participation in this study are low. Many of the&#xD;
           questions used in the survey have been used before in the Uganda National Household&#xD;
           Survey. Cognitive tests consist of simple games played between a trained enumerator and&#xD;
           the child and are unlikely to pose any risk to the children. Anthropometry measurements&#xD;
           are non-invasive and also pose no risk. Risks associated with hemoglobin data collection&#xD;
           are minimized through use of well-trained staff, a well-designed data collection&#xD;
           protocol, and safety lancets. The study poses no social, emotional, or psychological&#xD;
           risks to subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health provisions: If any child is found to be severely anemic (Hb&lt;7 g/dL) or wasted&#xD;
           (weight-for-height less than two standard deviations below the mean), that child and the&#xD;
           child's parents are notified and the child is referred to the nearest clinic for medical&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Informed consent: Details about the study are provided verbally to local leaders at the&#xD;
           LC1 (roughly the equivalent of a village) level. The same information, including the&#xD;
           right to opt out at any time, is provided verbally to survey respondents in sampled&#xD;
           households. Additional informed consent is sought before each direct interaction with&#xD;
           children, including for cognitive tests, anthropometry, and hemoglobin measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IRB: This study underwent internal review with the International Food Policy Research&#xD;
           Institute; permission to conduct the data collection was granted by Uganda National&#xD;
           Council for Science and Technology (SS 2470).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Funding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This evaluation was funded by the World Food Programme, with support from the Spanish&#xD;
      government and other sources through the Strategic Impact Evaluation Trust Fund at WFP, and&#xD;
      by the United Nations Children's Fund.&#xD;
