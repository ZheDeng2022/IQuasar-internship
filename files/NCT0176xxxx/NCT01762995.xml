  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human immune virus (HIV) infected subjects may take mineral supplements in combination with&#xD;
      their antiretroviral medications. Calcium and Iron supplementations are commonly used and&#xD;
      both of these have the potential to interact with Dolutegravir (DTG), this study will&#xD;
      evaluate the potential of calcium and iron supplements to decrease DTG exposure. It will also&#xD;
      evaluate two possible strategies for combined use; if an interaction is observed. The first&#xD;
      strategy is a two hour separation. The second strategy involves the administration of DTG and&#xD;
      the supplement with a meal since the presence of food modestly increases DTG exposure, and&#xD;
      because mineral supplements can be administered with food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open label, randomized, two cohort, four-period cross-over study in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers. One cohort will examine the effects of calcium carbonate and the other cohort&#xD;
      will examine the effects of ferrous fumarate on the pharmacokinetic (PK) of DTG.&#xD;
      Approximately 12 subjects will be enrolled into each of the two cohorts and receive each of&#xD;
      four treatments in a randomized fashion: 1) A single dose of DTG 50 milligram (mg)&#xD;
      administered under fasted conditions ; 2) A single dose of DTG 50 mg co-administered with a&#xD;
      single dose of calcium carbonate or ferrous fumarate under fasted conditions ; 3) A single&#xD;
      dose of DTG 50 mg co-administered with a single dose of calcium carbonate or ferrous fumarate&#xD;
      with a moderate-fat meal; 4) A single dose of DTG 50 mg administered under fasted conditions&#xD;
      2 hours prior to administration of a single dose of calcium carbonate or ferrous fumarate.&#xD;
      There will be a washout period of at least 7 days between treatments. Safety evaluations and&#xD;
      serial PK samples will be collected during each treatment period. A follow-up visit will&#xD;
      occur 7-14 days after the last dose of study drug. This study will be conducted at one center&#xD;
      in the United States, with healthy adult male and female subjects.&#xD;
