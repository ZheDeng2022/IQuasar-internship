      The pelvic floor disorders are a major problem in our current society with manifestations of&#xD;
      micturition disorders, defecatory problems and sexual dysfunction. The pelvic floor muscles&#xD;
      training arouses interest due the few studies on this subject. Studies are being conducted&#xD;
      with emphasis on the post-prostatectomy urinary disorders, however, not associated with&#xD;
      radiotherapy. The study of the effect of radiotherapy in these muscles is still uncertain. At&#xD;
      right, we do not know if the effect of radiation can trigger important anatomical changes&#xD;
      that could lead to pelvic floor disorders manifesting clinically as defecatory and urinary&#xD;
      disorders. These issues motivate us to research, focusing on the evaluation of these muscles&#xD;
      through magnetic nuclear resonance considering that radiation therapy has been increasingly&#xD;
      used as a therapeutic option in the treatment of prostate cancer. The primary objective of&#xD;
      this is to verify the effect of pelvic floor muscles training (PFMT) tract symptoms (LUTS),&#xD;
      anorectal and sexual complaints in men with prostate cancer (PCa) treated with radiotherapy&#xD;
      (RT). Secondly, the objective is to evaluate the effect of PFMT in its function and in the&#xD;
      severity of urinary incontinence (UI) and evaluate the quality of life. The assessment of the&#xD;
      changes occurred by the effect of radiation separately and jointly to the training of the&#xD;
      pelvic floor muscles can help us to better understand some of the dysfunctions presented in&#xD;
      this sample of patients as well as understanding the effect and the possible contribution of&#xD;
      training of these muscles for treatment and/or prevention of these disorders.&#xD;

      This present research is a randomized controlled clinical trial to be held in Clinics&#xD;
      Hospital of Medical School of Ribeirão Preto - University of São Paulo (HCFMRP-USP) including&#xD;
      men with confirmed diagnosis of prostate cancer by biopsy and having clinical indication for&#xD;
      radiotherapy treatment (RT) who follow-up in the HCFMRP-USP and voluntarily consent to&#xD;
      participate in this research. After consent, each patient must sign the consent term and then&#xD;
      will be allocated by randomization in one of the following study groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Training group (TG): the group of patients undergoing radiotherapy and submitted to&#xD;
           pelvic floor muscles training;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control group (CG): the group of patients undergoing radiotherapy only. This research&#xD;
           consists in four assessment: (1) Assessment 01: before started of radiotherapy; (2)&#xD;
           Assessment 02: after two weeks started of RT; (3) Assessment 03: 03 months after started&#xD;
           of RT (4) Assessment 04: 06 months after started of RT. All these assessments will be&#xD;
           common for the participants of the research independently from the group they belong.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each assessment, images of the pelvic floor muscles will be acquired by nuclear magnetic&#xD;
      resonance. Parallel to the MRI, there will be a clinical assessment of the patient which&#xD;
      consist of anamnesis and physical examination, where the assessment of pelvic floor muscle&#xD;
      function will be tested objectively using a perineometer to evaluate the peak and the mean&#xD;
      contraction as well as the duration of the performed sustained contraction. Data will be&#xD;
      collected from three contractions, whose mean value will be used for this study. The&#xD;
      myoelectric activity will be evaluated using electromyography biofeedback with&#xD;
      electromyography anal probes. The patient will also answer a quality of life questionnaire&#xD;
      (EORTC QLQ-C30 e PR25) and the others questionnaire: ICIQ-SF, QS-M and Jorge-Wexner Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient of TG will be included in a supervised training protocol of the pelvic floor&#xD;
      muscles. This protocol will be conducted in conjunction with the radiotherapy sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The supervised muscle training will be conducted once a week with 45 minutes each session&#xD;
      during the RT (12 weeks - 3 months). In addition to the supervised sessions, patients in this&#xD;
      group will be instructed about the practice of home exercises and receive a guidance booklet&#xD;
      of exercises with explanations of each exercise to be performed. These exercises must be&#xD;
      performed daily and should be written down in the worksheet when they are performed. After&#xD;
      this 3 month period, the patients will be encouraged to continue the exercise protocol at&#xD;
      home without supervision. They must attend monthly to monitor adherence to home exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group (CG) patients will not be instructed to perform pelvic floor exercises,&#xD;
      instead they will only be assessed within the stipulated time.&#xD;
