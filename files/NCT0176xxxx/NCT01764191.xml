  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has been designed to provide patients suspected of having cardiac sarcoidosis (CS)&#xD;
      with a potentially diagnostic 18F FDG PET/CT. CS is difficult to diagnose with currently&#xD;
      available methods, therefore this project will allow access to 18F FDG PET/CT scanning, which&#xD;
      may more accurately diagnose the presence of CS. This study will also provide additional data&#xD;
      to further examine the effectiveness and safety profile of 18F FDG for this condition.&#xD;
      Accurate and early detection is important to allow for better management of CS and improve&#xD;
      patient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to provide access to 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging in patients with&#xD;
      clinical suspicion of cardiac sarcoidosis, and to collect additional data about the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of 18F-FDG PET/CT in this patient population&#xD;

      1. Purpose:The purpose of this study is to provide access to 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging in&#xD;
           patients with clinical suspicion of cardiac sarcoidosis, and to collect additional data&#xD;
           about the safety and effectiveness of 18F-FDG PET/CT in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hypothesis:18F-FDG PET/CT has greater sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy compared to&#xD;
           the current clinical gold standard of diagnosis for CS, the Japanese Ministry of Health,&#xD;
           Labour, and Welfare (MHLW) guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Justification:Currently a clinical diagnosis CS is diagnosed using a combination of&#xD;
           diagnostic techniques including imaging and biopsy. Biopsies are challenging as it can&#xD;
           be difficult to locate the disease or access the desired biopsy location. MRI has been&#xD;
           proven effective but it is limited as patients with pacemakers and&#xD;
           cardioverter-defibrillators or patients with renal impairments are unable to have an&#xD;
           MRI. Finally radionuclide scintigraphy with Gallium-67 or Thallium-201 (201Tl) has been&#xD;
           useful, but can be non-specific for sarcoidosis. 18F-FDG PET/CT has significant&#xD;
           advantages over other radionuclide imaging modalities due to superior resolution of PET&#xD;
           coupled with the affinity of inflammatory cardiac tissue to metabolize FDG. 18F-FDG&#xD;
           PET/CT has been found to have higher sensitivity and specificity over other&#xD;
           conventionally used imaging modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Research Method:This will be an expanded access study in which adult subjects with a&#xD;
           clinical suspicion of CS will be invited to participate, in order to identify potential&#xD;
           sites for biopsy or provide confirmation of the presence of CS. Based on population&#xD;
           extrapolation from all diagnosed or suspected cases of CS in British Columbia (BC), as&#xD;
           well as expert clinical opinion, it is estimated that 10 to 15 patients per year will be&#xD;
           enrolled in the study. Over a three year period, the expected sample size will be 30 -&#xD;
           45 patients. All subjects will receive an 18F-FDG PET/CT at the BC Cancer Agency (BCCA)&#xD;
           - Vancouver Centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Statistical Analysis:The planned sample size is 150 patients. The primary endpoint is to&#xD;
           provide PET/CT imaging to patients diagnosed with or suspected of CS. The secondary&#xD;
           end-point will be to assess the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 18F-FDG PET in&#xD;
           BC population. Confidence intervals of 95% will be used to assess this using exact&#xD;
           binomial distribution. All analyses will be performed in direct consultation with a&#xD;
           qualified statistician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensitivity (ratio of true positive lesions to total positive lesions), specificity (ratio of&#xD;
      true negative lesions to total negative lesions) and accuracy (ratio of total correct studies&#xD;
      to the total number of biopsied lesions) of 18F-FDG PET studies performed by the BCCA will be&#xD;
      obtained by comparing results of the PET scan with a composite of the outcome of clinical&#xD;
      examinations, histopathological diagnosis, if those results are available, and results of all&#xD;
      other available imaging (cardiac MRI, 201Tl, 67Ga). Confidence intervals (95% CI) for&#xD;
      sensitivity, specificity and accuracy will be calculated using exact binomial distribution.&#xD;

    <description>All subjects suspected of cardiac sarcoidosis will receive an intravenous dose of 18F-FDG (determined by weight, but not to exceed 521 MBq). Following an uptake phase of about 60 minutes, each subject will receive a PET/CT scan to evaluate the presence of cardiac sarcoidosis.</description>
