      The Zeltiq CoolSculpting System technology for cold-assisted lipolysis will be used with a&#xD;
      modified belt applicator for the reduction of fat on the outer thigh. This is an open label,&#xD;
      interventional, non-randomized feasibility study.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in the Fat Layer of the Treated Area as Measured by Ultrasound The Change in Fat Layer Thickness in the Treated Outer Thigh</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 16 weeks post-final treatment</time_frame>
    <description>For each subject, ultrasound measurements will be obtained from the treated area and the contralateral untreated control area. The change in fat layer thickness in the untreated control thigh between baseline and 16 weeks will be used to account for variation in subject body weight during the study. The fat layer thickness change in the treated area will be normalized by subtracting the change in the untreated control thigh to remove the influence of subject weight variations. The normalized value will be used to evaluate success. The result is considered the treatment effect, an absolute change, and is reported as a mean change for the study population in centimeters of fat layer reduction.</description>

    <measure>Safety of the Zeltiq System and Procedure</measure>
    <time_frame>Study enrollment through 16 weeks post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The number of device- and/or procedure related adverse events will be tabulated. Adverse event reports are collected throughout the study from the time of enrollment through the final 16 week follow-up visit. Investigators will determine whether an adverse event has a relationship to the study device or procedure.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent of Correct Identification of Pre-treatment Photos</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 16 weeks post-final treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Change in the treated vs. untreated areas will be assessed by observation of changes in surface contour and/or fat volume by an independent photo review of pre-treatment and post-treatment images of the treated areas. Reviewers will be practicing dermatologists or plastic surgeons. All reviewers will be blinded to post-treatment vs. baseline untreated area. The order in which images will be presented will be randomized; for each subject placement of the baseline, pre-treatment image will be randomized for each pair of subject images. Reviewers will be asked to select the baseline (pre-treatment) photos for each subject photo series and record selections on a data collection form. Criteria for evaluable photos for the purposes of the independent review: subject completed treatment regimen; subject has complete set of baseline photos; subject has a complete set of post-treatment photos; photos were taken using Zeltiq standard procedure.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Satisfaction on Questionnaire Questions</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Subject satisfaction as assessed by questionnaires administered at 16 weeks post-treatment. The questionnaire was composed of 5-point Likert scale questions, as well as free text responses. Each question offered five choices, ranging from very favorable, somewhat favorable, neutral/not sure, unfavorable and very unfavorable responses.</description>

        <title>Change in the Fat Layer of the Treated Area as Measured by Ultrasound The Change in Fat Layer Thickness in the Treated Outer Thigh</title>
        <description>For each subject, ultrasound measurements will be obtained from the treated area and the contralateral untreated control area. The change in fat layer thickness in the untreated control thigh between baseline and 16 weeks will be used to account for variation in subject body weight during the study. The fat layer thickness change in the treated area will be normalized by subtracting the change in the untreated control thigh to remove the influence of subject weight variations. The normalized value will be used to evaluate success. The result is considered the treatment effect, an absolute change, and is reported as a mean change for the study population in centimeters of fat layer reduction.</description>

Six (6) subjects out of the 37 who completed the study, were excluded from the ultrasound measurement analysis because they had weight change greater than 5 pounds.</population>

Reviewers will be practicing dermatologists or plastic surgeons. All reviewers will be blinded to post-treatment vs. baseline untreated area. The order in which images will be presented will be randomized; for each subject placement of the baseline, pre-treatment image will be randomized for each pair of subject images. Reviewers will be asked to select the baseline (pre-treatment) photos for each subject photo series and record selections on a data collection form. Criteria for evaluable photos for the purposes of the independent review: subject completed treatment regimen; subject has complete set of baseline photos; subject has a complete set of post-treatment photos; photos were taken using Zeltiq standard procedure.</description>
