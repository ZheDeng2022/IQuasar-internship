      The investigators propose a study to investigate the role of tetracycline injection into&#xD;
      chalazia versus observation alone. The investigators hypothesize tetracycline injection will&#xD;
      result in a significant decrease in lesion size when compared to observation alone.&#xD;

      Intralesional Tetracycline Injection in the Treatment of Chalazia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Authors: Bryan R. Costin, M.D. and Julian D. Perry, M.D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: To investigate the therapeutic role of intralesional tetracycline injection when&#xD;
      compared to observation alone in the treatment of chalazia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tetracycline family includes tetracycline, doxycycline, and minocycline and this group of&#xD;
      compounds has a surprising number of properties including but not limited to antibiotic,&#xD;
      anti-malarial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant. Recent applications include uses both in&#xD;
      sclerotherapy in a wide variety of conditions from ganglions cysts to lymphangiomas to&#xD;
      ovarian cysts as well as in the reduction of hypertrophic scarring in rabbit models.1,2,3,4&#xD;
      In 2009, there were approximately 130 ongoing clinical trials studying this class of drugs in&#xD;
      an astounding variety of conditions from gingivitis to Alzheimer disease to brain cancer.5&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chalazia are lipogranulomatous inflammatory lesions of the eyelid and are one of the most&#xD;
      common eyelid lesions and an extremely frequent presenting complaint to the ophthalmologist.&#xD;
      Chalazia often represent significant morbidity for the patients suffering from these lesions&#xD;
      because they are often recurrent, can be refractory to treatment, and are disfiguring.&#xD;
      Consequently, chalazia can also be a challenge to the ophthalmologist. Oral tetracyclines&#xD;
      have been shown to be effective in the treatment of ocular rosacea and meibomian gland&#xD;
      dysfunction (MGD), which are conditions commonly seen in association with chalazia. The&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory effect of the tetracyclines is thought to be beneficial in rosacea and&#xD;
      these drugs have been shown to alter the fatty acid composition of the lipid layer of the&#xD;
      tear film perhaps explaining their efficacy in MGD.6&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chalazia eventually resolve without intervention, but the process can take many months and&#xD;
      patients are frequently dissatisfied with observation as a treatment modality. Often patients&#xD;
      choose incision and drainage (I&amp;D) of the lesion and this method is often successful. Another&#xD;
      treatment shown to be effective in chalazion treatment is the injection of corticosteroid&#xD;
      directly into the lesion, hence providing a depot anti-inflammatory effect.7 However, unlike&#xD;
      corticosteroids, the tetracyclines would offer antibiotic, sclerosant, and lipid tear film&#xD;
      augmentation, in addition to their anti-inflammatory effect. Further, tetracyclines are FDA&#xD;
      approved for the treatment of acne8, which is defined as inflammation of pilosebaceous&#xD;
      units9, and chalazia are defined as inflammation of sebaceous glands10. With these multiple&#xD;
      roles in mind, we propose injection of tetracycline into chalazia to investigate its use as a&#xD;
      multipurpose depot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After IRB approval, chalazia patients who wish to participate will be enrolled after the&#xD;
      risks, benefits, alternatives, and personnel have been explained to them and informed consent&#xD;
      has been obtained. A total of 80 subjects will be randomized to one of two groups: 40&#xD;
      subjects to observation alone and 40 subjects to treatment with an intralesional injection of&#xD;
      0.05 mL 2% tetracycline solution. Subjects will be excluded from the study if they are less&#xD;
      than 18 years of age, are pregnant, have chalazia of less than 1 week duration, have known&#xD;
      allergies to tetracycline or its derivatives, or are currently taking oral tetracyclines or&#xD;
      have taken them in the past 3 months. Men, post-menopausal women, and women who have&#xD;
      undergone hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral salpingectomy will not be tested&#xD;
      for pregnancy. Pregnancy testing (urine or serum) will be performed on women of childbearing&#xD;
      age before enrollment and the results checked prior to the administration of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients with multiple lesions, either on the same or opposite eyelids, only the most&#xD;
      symptomatic lesion will be enrolled in the study. Eyelid margin disease and ocular rosacea&#xD;
      will be documented at the time of enrollment. Subjects will then be examined at 4 weeks (+/-&#xD;
      2 weeks) post-procedure follow-up visits where data regarding lesion size, including color&#xD;
      photography, lesion regression or recurrence, and a complete ophthalmic examination will be&#xD;
      recorded. If subjects fail to follow up at any of these visits, telephone interviews will be&#xD;
      conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of enrollment, the subject's date of birth, sex, race/ethnicity, and last&#xD;
      menstrual period will be determined as well as a gynecological history to determine need for&#xD;
      pregnancy testing. Data collection sheets will be used to record information. Also, previous&#xD;
      therapies including topical medications and previous surgeries will be reviewed. A millimeter&#xD;
      ruler will be used at the time of enrollment to determine the size of the lesion. Lesion&#xD;
      photographs will also be taken so that the independent chalazion photograph reviewer will be&#xD;
      able to grade degrees of improvement after treatment in a masked fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the procedure is performed, a variable pain scale will be used by the patient to&#xD;
      document their level of discomfort during the injection. At the return post procedure visit,&#xD;
      the lesion will be re-measured, the patient will be asked to grade the level of improvement&#xD;
      and a follow up photograph will be taken for use by the masked grader. All data collection&#xD;
      sheets and consents will be stored at the Cleveland Clinic in a secure location. All other&#xD;
      study data will be electronic and stored only on the secure Cleveland Clinic server or&#xD;
      Cleveland Clinic issued encrypted devices such as thumb drives and laptops. The occurrence of&#xD;
      any minor adverse or unexpected events will be reported to the principal investigator. Any&#xD;
      sentinel events will be reported to the IRB immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A decrease in lesion size by two-thirds of greater as determined by either the clinician or&#xD;
      the masked photograph reviewer in either group will be considered improvement and if seen in&#xD;
      lesions injected with tetracycline it will constitute treatment success.&#xD;
