    <textblock>
      The most important cause of mortality amongst DM2 patients is cardiovascular disease. An&#xD;
      early finding of cardiovascular disease in DM2 and obesity is diastolic dysfunction.&#xD;
      Diastolic dysfunction is an independent predictor of mortality and has been shown to improve&#xD;
      in patients on a low calorie diet. The improvement of diastolic function was associated with&#xD;
      a reduction in triglyceride accumulation in the heart and liver. A relatively new widely&#xD;
      prescribed therapeutic agent for DM2 patients is Liraglutide (Victoza®). Liraglutide is a&#xD;
      Glucagon Like Peptide - 1 homologue that improves glucose homeostasis and reduces blood&#xD;
      pressure and body weight. Next to the induction of weight loss, which is potentially&#xD;
      beneficial for cardiac function, GLP-1 therapy might have a direct advantageous effect on the&#xD;
      cardiovascular system. However, the effect of Liraglutide on cardiovascular function has not&#xD;
      been investigated yet. The investigators hypothesize that treatment of DM2 patients with&#xD;
      Liraglutide is associated with improvement of cardiovascular function and a reduction of&#xD;
      triglyceride accumulation in end-organs.&#xD;

      1. INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE&#xD;
&#xD;
           Type 2 diabetes mellitus is an endemic disease associated with obesity and a sedentary&#xD;
           lifestyle. In the year 2025 the prevalence of DM2 patients worldwide is expected to be&#xD;
           334 million. In the year 2000 there were an estimated 2,9 million diabetes-related&#xD;
           deaths worldwide. Especially cardiovascular disease contributes for a great deal to the&#xD;
           high mortality rates. Diabetes patients have a two-fold excess risk for a wide range of&#xD;
           vascular diseases, independently of other risk factors, making cardiovascular disease&#xD;
           the leading cause of death of diabetes patients. Therefore, treatment of DM2 is focused&#xD;
           on the prevention of cardiovascular disease and other diabetes related complications&#xD;
           such as retinopathy, neuropathy and nephropathy. Unfortunately, despite lifestyle&#xD;
           advises, glucose lowering therapy and co-treatment of other risk factors such as&#xD;
           hypertension and dyslipidemia, complication rates remain high. Classical glucose&#xD;
           lowering treatment strategies such as sulfonylurea derivatives and insulin ultimately&#xD;
           can not control the disease, partly because they participate in the vicious cycle of&#xD;
           increasing body weight and insulin resistance. A hopeful new therapeutic agent is the&#xD;
           Glucagon Like Peptide -1 analogue Liraglutide. Next to its glucose lowering effect, it&#xD;
           reduces body weight resulting in increased insulin sensitivity. The group of GLP-1&#xD;
           analogues are therefore widely prescribed nowadays. However, the effect on the&#xD;
           cardiovascular system has not been investigated yet. Since cardiovascular disease is the&#xD;
           major threat for the DM2 patient, the effect of this new drug on the cardiovascular&#xD;
           system is a very important issue. Interestingly, a cardio-protective effect from&#xD;
           Liraglutide can be expected on the basis of both the associated weight loss and because&#xD;
           of a direct protective effect on the heart. The investigators hypothesize that treatment&#xD;
           with Liraglutide improves cardiac function in DM2 patients. The pathogenesis of&#xD;
           cardiovascular disease in DM2 is rather complex and multifactorial. Ultimately most&#xD;
           patients develop myocardial infarction and / or heart failure. Often DM2 patients&#xD;
           already have subclinical signs of cardiac dysfunction before DM2 is recognized, the main&#xD;
           early sign being diastolic dysfunction. Diastolic dysfunction is a strong predictor of&#xD;
           mortality. The subclinical characteristics of cardiac dysfunction are highly associated&#xD;
           with a condition called the metabolic syndrome. The metabolic syndrome consists of the&#xD;
           existence of three out of five of the following risk factors: 1. elevated waist&#xD;
           circumference; 2. elevated triglycerides; 3. reduced HDL-C; 4. elevated blood pressure;&#xD;
           5. elevated fasting blood glucose including diabetic-range elevated blood glucose level.&#xD;
           With these criteria most patients with diabetes meet the criteria for the metabolic&#xD;
           syndrome. A key element in the pathogenesis of the metabolic syndrome might be ectopic&#xD;
           fat deposition; the earliest sign of the syndrome being visceral adiposity. Next to&#xD;
           visceral adiposity, there is significant deposition of ectopic fat stores in the liver,&#xD;
           heart, skeletal muscle and kidney. Triglyceride accumulation in the cardiomyocyte is&#xD;
           called myocardial steatosis. Studies performed by our group have proven that caloric&#xD;
           restriction results in a reduction in myocardial steatosis and improvement of diastolic&#xD;
           function. Hence, myocardial steatosis and associated cardiac dysfunction seem to be&#xD;
           reversible as is the case for hepatic steatosis. The putative mechanism of steatosis&#xD;
           resulting in cardiac dysfunction is thought to be explained by a phenomenon called&#xD;
           lipotoxicity. Altered substrate metabolism and insulin resistance of cardiomyocytes may&#xD;
           also play an important role in the pathogenesis of cardiac dysfunction in obesity and&#xD;
           DM2. Systemic and cardiac insulin resistance was proven to be associated with increased&#xD;
           production of toxic lipids such as diacylglycerol and ceramide. The ultimate treatment&#xD;
           for obesity and diabetes related cardiac disease seems to be weight loss. However,&#xD;
           lifestyle intervention programs have repeatedly been unsuccessful to have a sustained&#xD;
           long term effect. Liraglutide is characterized as a long-acting, human GLP-1 analogue as&#xD;
           it shows 97% homology with the amino acid sequence of human GLP-1. The phase 3a program&#xD;
           for Liraglutide encompasses five clinical trials in which Liraglutide treatment was&#xD;
           studied in each stage of the treatment cascade for type 2 diabetes mellitus. In five&#xD;
           studies, Liraglutide was compared directly to standard treatment. The phase 3a clinical&#xD;
           development program, included 3,978 exposed patients with DM2, investigated the efficacy&#xD;
           and tolerability of Liraglutide 1.2 or 1.8 mg daily (n = 2735) as monotherapy and in&#xD;
           combination with various oral antidiabetic drugs. The phase 3a studies showed HBA1C&#xD;
           reductions of 1-1.5% and fasting plasma glucose reductions of 0,83 - 2,39 mmol/L. In&#xD;
           addition, weight reduction was consistent: Liraglutide 1.8 mg as monotherapy was&#xD;
           accompanied by a mean weight loss of 2.5 kg over a 52-week period. A substudy of two&#xD;
           phase 3a trials showed that the weight loss caused by Liraglutide, is predominantly&#xD;
           caused by a reduction in fat mass; the visceral fat compartment was reduced by 16% from&#xD;
           baseline during 26 weeks of Liraglutide 1,2 mg daily. Recent experimental data suggest&#xD;
           GLP-1 and its analogues to have direct effects on the heart. In studies on rat heart,&#xD;
           the size of an infarct was diminished by more than 50% by an infusion of GLP-1. Post&#xD;
           conditioning efficacy of GLP-1 was also demonstrated in an ex vivo rat heart. Exendin-4&#xD;
           was shown to diminish infarct size by approximately 56% and 39%, respectively, in rat&#xD;
           global and pig focal models of heart ischemia. The GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) is present in&#xD;
           the cardiomyocytes as well as in the endothelium and smooth muscle cells of myocardial&#xD;
           vasculature. The cell death effector mechanisms targeted by the GLP-1R appear to be&#xD;
           mitochondrial permeability transition and apoptosis. Animal studies have suggested&#xD;
           myocardial contractility improvement after GLP-1 administration. For instance, dogs with&#xD;
           dilated cardiomyopathy treated with GLP-1 for 48 h showed strong improvements in&#xD;
           myocardial contractility and cardiac output. GLP-1 infusion was associated with&#xD;
           increased myocardial glucose uptake, suggesting ameliorated insulin sensitivity of the&#xD;
           cardiomyocytes. In a few small clinical studies, GLP-1 was infused to patients after PCI&#xD;
           for approximately 72 h and to patients selected for elective coronary artery bypass&#xD;
           grafting from 12 h before to 48 h after the surgery. The latter group showed an improved&#xD;
           metabolic profile but no hemodynamic change. In contrast, a left ventricular ejection&#xD;
           fraction (LVEF) increase from 29% to 39% was found in the former study, as well as in a&#xD;
           study of 12 diabetic, overweight heart failure patients (New York Heart Association&#xD;
           class III/IV, LVEF ≤ 40%), given GLP-1 infusion for 5 weeks: at the end of the&#xD;
           treatment, these patients showed an increased LVEF, cardiac output, and improved scores&#xD;
           in a life quality questionnaire. A number of laboratory studies have suggested a&#xD;
           vasorelaxant effect of GLP-1. No pressor effect has been found associated with GLP-1&#xD;
           treatment in studies on diabetic patients. In fact, a decrease of both systolic and&#xD;
           diastolic blood pressure values was noted in DM2 patients after an 82-week exenatide&#xD;
           trial [33], in a manner correlated to weight loss. Recent experiments (unpublished data)&#xD;
           have shown that the GLP-1 analogue exendin - 4 can protect against atherosclerosis and&#xD;
           non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in APOE 3 - Leiden.CETP mice on a western diet&#xD;
           probably due to decreased hepatic CETP expression as well as reduced monocyte&#xD;
           recruitment from the circulation to the vessel wall. In addition, hepatic steatosis was&#xD;
           improved by a GLP-1 receptor agonist in mice. So far, no dedicated clinical studies have&#xD;
           been performed to systematically study the effects of GLP-1 analogues on cardiovascular&#xD;
           function. Given the consistency of the results from animal experiments and clinical&#xD;
           observations, this area appears ripe for clinical studies. Beneficial effects on&#xD;
           cardiovascular endpoints will be crucial to consolidate the therapeutic profile of&#xD;
           Liraglutide. Although large scale studies on cardiovascular endpoints are underway, an&#xD;
           attractive option is to perform small scale, short-term studies with advanced&#xD;
           cardiovascular imaging techniques. Thereby gaining insight in what way GLP-1 therapy&#xD;
           affects the cardiovascular system. Advanced cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
           and spectroscopy (MRI/S) enables to assess effects of interventions, in relatively small&#xD;
           groups of patients in a limited period of time. As these cardiovascular parameters are&#xD;
           strong and clinically relevant predictors of cardiovascular events, measurements of&#xD;
           these parameters with MRI/S are worthwhile. Our research group has developed advanced&#xD;
           cardiovascular MRI and MRS techniques and algorithms and gained extended experience in&#xD;
           the field of DM2 related cardiac function and lipid metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. RECRUITMENT AND SCREENING PROCEDURE OF STUDY POPULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will be recruited from the outpatient clinics of the Leiden University Medical&#xD;
           Center, general practitioners, local hospitals and by advertisement. Patients own&#xD;
           physicists will be asked to point eligible patients to the opportunity of study&#xD;
           participation. If interested, patients will be informed by the principal investigator.&#xD;
           Patients will be given oral and written explanation about the study. After a&#xD;
           consideration time of two weeks, patients are asked to give written acknowledgement of&#xD;
           informed consent to participate. Then a medical screening will take place. Screening&#xD;
           will be performed after an overnight fast of at least 12 hours. The screening will&#xD;
           consist of a medical history, physical examination consisting of measurement of height,&#xD;
           body weight, heart rate, blood pressure and examination of thorax and abdomen.&#xD;
           Furthermore laboratory tests and rest-ECG will be performed. If the patient is eligible-&#xD;
           and willing to participate in the study, and has signed the informed consent, the&#xD;
           patient will be included. Informed consent must be obtained before any trial related&#xD;
           activities take place. After inclusion in the study protocol, the patient's treating&#xD;
           physician and general practitioner will be notified. Although the patients are free to&#xD;
           leave the study at any time, it will be attempted to recruit patients who are likely to&#xD;
           continue the study to completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
           Because of the absence of data on the effects of GLP-1 in DM2 patients without heart&#xD;
           failure, it is hard to calculate the sample size needed to detect differences between&#xD;
           myocardial function at 26 weeks between active treatment and controls. Clinically&#xD;
           relevant differences and standard deviations of two studies were chosen to generate data&#xD;
           for the sample size calculation. The data we used to incorporate the precision of MRI&#xD;
           assessment of cardiac function was generated by a study performed by our group with&#xD;
           pioglitazone vs metformin on cardiac function parameters. To estimate the effect of&#xD;
           GLP-1 therapy on cardiac function, we only have data of a pilot study with eight DM2&#xD;
           patients with heart failure. Calculations for diastolic function parameters were based&#xD;
           on the &quot;early deceleration peak&quot; and for systolic function on the basis of &quot;ejection&#xD;
           fraction&quot;. With a power of 90% and alfa = 0.05, groups varying from 9 to 17 patients&#xD;
           will be needed. In a comparable trial the drop-out rate was 10%. Taken into&#xD;
           consideration that the population studied will have a significant better systolic&#xD;
           function than the heart failure patients studied by Sokos et al, differences may be&#xD;
           smaller. In conclusion, investigators estimate to be able to detect a clinically&#xD;
           relevant, significant result with 90% power and alfa = 0.05 with 25 patients in each&#xD;
           group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. USE OF CO-INTERVENTION&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients should continue to use the oral glucose lowering medicament metformin during&#xD;
           the study. For glycaemic control after initiation of the study drug, the current&#xD;
           clinical guideline will be followed. Excluded concomitant therapy: thiazolidinediones,&#xD;
           other GLP-1 analogues or DPP-IV inhibitors, fibrates, prednisone, cytostatic and&#xD;
           antiretroviral therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Permitted concomitant medication: any other medication required, including SU&#xD;
           derivatives, insulin, antihypertensive agents and incidental analgesic and antibiotic&#xD;
           therapy. Glycaemic management during study the will be performed as described in&#xD;
           appendix 1. To avoid the potential risk of hypoglycaemia, a rigorous monitoring and&#xD;
           therapy adjustment schedule will be applied, which will prevent risk of hypoglycemia to&#xD;
           a great extent. In addition, patients will be instructed how to recognize and manage a&#xD;
           hypo or hyperglycaemic episode. Appropriate individualized adjustments will be made in&#xD;
           the unlikely case of a hypo or hyperglycaemic episode. Routine self-measurement of blood&#xD;
           glucose by the study participants will be performed once a week. In addition, patients&#xD;
           with insulin will be instructed to perform routine self-measurement of blood glucose&#xD;
           more frequently when study medication and / or insulin dosage is titrated (see appendix&#xD;
           1).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Furthermore patients are asked not to change their diet or level of physical activity&#xD;
           during the study period and adequate contraception is obligatory for study&#xD;
           participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. RANDOMIZATION, BLINDING AND TREATMENT ALLOCATION&#xD;
&#xD;
           After the medical screening and mutual agreement of participation in the study, patients&#xD;
           will be randomized by block randomization, stratified 1:1 for gender and insulin use. A&#xD;
           randomization schedule will be prepared by the research pharmacist who is employee at&#xD;
           the Department of Clinical Pharmacy. Coded and sealed envelopes for each participant&#xD;
           will be kept at the department of Radiology. In case of safety issues, the sealed&#xD;
           envelopes are readily available to the principal investigator and project leader. In&#xD;
           case of a serious adverse event - or a medical emergency requiring knowledge of the&#xD;
           study medication - the randomization code will be broken. In order to ensure that in&#xD;
           medical emergencies, the study participation of the patient is apparent, each patient&#xD;
           will receive a patient file in the electronic patient registry. In this personal file,&#xD;
           the study number of the patient including the procedure for deblinding and notification&#xD;
           of the investigators will be mentioned. When the whole study is completed the&#xD;
           randomization list will be provided to the principle investigator by the pharmacist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. STUDY PROCEDURES&#xD;
&#xD;
           Withdrawal of individual subjects: Patients can leave the study at any time for any&#xD;
           reason if they wish to do so without any consequences. The responsible investigator can&#xD;
           also withdraw a subject if continuing participation is in his opinion deleterious for&#xD;
           the subject's well being. Patients can also be withdrawn in case of protocol violations&#xD;
           and non-compliance. When a subject withdraws from the study, a medical examination will&#xD;
           be performed. In case of withdrawal because of a severe or serious adverse event,&#xD;
           appropriate laboratory tests or other special examinations will be performed. Finally&#xD;
           patients can be withdrawn from study participation if an incidental finding at the MRI&#xD;
           examination - for example a malignancy - influences the ratio of justification versus&#xD;
           risks / benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Specific criteria for withdrawal: not applicable&#xD;
&#xD;
           Replacement of individual subjects after withdrawal: Patients will not be replaced after&#xD;
           withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Follow-up of subjects withdrawn from treatment: Follow-up of patients after withdrawal&#xD;
           will be done by the treating physicist (general practitioner in most cases). Immediately&#xD;
           after study withdrawal, the treating physicist will be updated on the patient's&#xD;
           condition and laboratory results and whether the patient was in the control group or&#xD;
           intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Premature termination of the study: In case of the incidence of three serious adverse&#xD;
           events, the study will be terminated prematurely and an independent committee will be&#xD;
           asked to investigate the safety of the trial. Furthermore, the investigators will&#xD;
           prematurely terminate the study when the number of subjects withdrawn from the study&#xD;
           exceeds the number used for sample size calculation, i.e. 16 individuals in total.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. ADVERSE EVENTS, SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS and SUSPECTED UNEXPECTED SERIOUS ADVERSE&#xD;
           REACTIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events (AEs):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events are defined as any undesirable experience occurring to a subject during a&#xD;
      clinical trial, whether or not considered related to the used medication or the infused&#xD;
      drugs. All adverse events reported spontaneously by the subject or observed by the&#xD;
      investigator or his/her staff will be recorded on the adverse event data collection form. The&#xD;
      intensity of these adverse events will be graded by the investigator as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mild: Discomfort noted but no disruption of normal daily activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Moderate: Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severe: Inability to work or perform daily activity All adverse events will be actively&#xD;
           queried by asking the question: &quot;Have you had any complaints since the last time we&#xD;
           talked/met?&quot; at all visits. All adverse events will be followed until they have abated,&#xD;
           or until a stable situation has been reached. Depending on the event, follow up may&#xD;
           require additional tests or medical procedures as indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The chronicity of the event will be classified by the investigator on a three-item scale as&#xD;
      defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Single occasion: Single event with limited duration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intermittent: Several episodes of an event, each of limited duration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Persistent: Event that remains indefinitely For each adverse event, the relationship to&#xD;
           the used medication or infused drug (definite, probable, possible, unknown, definitively&#xD;
           not) as judged by the investigator, will be recorded, as well as any actions undertaken&#xD;
           in relation to the adverse event, will be recorded. The occurrence of an adverse event&#xD;
           that is fatal, life-threatening, disabling or requires in-patient hospitalization, or&#xD;
           causes congenital anomaly, will be described according to CHMP guidelines as (suspected)&#xD;
           &quot;serious&quot; adverse events and will be notified in writing to the Medical Ethics&#xD;
           Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the investigators will copy Novo Nordisk when expediting SARs and SUSARs to&#xD;
      competent authorities and will report all SARs related to Novo Nordisk product to Novo&#xD;
      Nordisk. The submission to Novo Nordisk must however be within day 15 from the investigator&#xD;
      getting knowledge about a valid case no matter local timelines for reporting to the&#xD;
      authorities. All pregnancies in trial patients occurring during use of a Novo Nordisk product&#xD;
      must be reported to Novo Nordisk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serious Adverse Events (SAEs):&#xD;
&#xD;
      A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence or effect that at any dose:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  results in death;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  is life threatening (at the time of the event);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing inpatients' hospitalization;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  is a congenital anomaly or birth defect;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any other important medical event that may not result in death, be life threatening, or&#xD;
           require hospitalization, may be considered a serious adverse experience when, based upon&#xD;
           appropriate medical judgement, the event may jeopardize the subject or may require an&#xD;
           intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sponsor will report the SAEs to the accredited METC that approved the protocol, within 15&#xD;
      days after the sponsor has first knowledge of the serious adverse reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAEs that result in death or are life threatening should be reported expedited. The expedited&#xD;
      reporting will occur not later than 7 days after the responsible investigator has first&#xD;
      knowledge of the adverse reaction. This is for a preliminary report with another 8 days for&#xD;
      completion of the report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unexpected adverse reactions are SUSARs if the following three conditions are met:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the event must be serious&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. there must be a certain degree of probability that the event is a harmful and an&#xD;
           undesirable reaction to the medicinal product under investigation, regardless of the&#xD;
           administered dose;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. the adverse reaction must be unexpected, that is to say, the nature and severity of the&#xD;
           adverse reaction are not in agreement with the product information as recorded in:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) for an authorized medicinal product;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Investigator's Brochure for an unauthorized medicinal product. The sponsor will&#xD;
                report expedited all SUSARs to the competent authorities in other Member States,&#xD;
                according to the requirements of the Member States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expedited reporting will occur not later than 15 days after the sponsor has first&#xD;
      knowledge of the adverse reactions. For fatal or life threatening cases the term will be&#xD;
      maximal 7 days for a preliminary report with another 8 days for completion of the report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAEs need to be reported till end of study within the Netherlands, as defined in the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      8. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary and secondary study parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study endpoints will be analyzed according to intention-to-treat principles. All endpoint&#xD;
      parameters are continuous variables. Data will be calculated as mean SD, median (percentile&#xD;
      range) according to nature and distribution of the variable. Within group changes from&#xD;
      baseline will be tested with independent paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Between&#xD;
      group differences will be compared after 26 weeks between Liraglutide and control. The&#xD;
      endpoints will be analyzed using a linear regression model, with gender, age, BMI and HBA1C&#xD;
      as covariates. For the covariates age, BMI and HbA1c in the primary analysis the baseline&#xD;
      value will be used. The data set for the primary analysis will include data from all subjects&#xD;
      with at least one post-baseline measurement. Analysis will be performed with SPSS. A 2-sided&#xD;
      significance level of p &lt; 0.05 will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9 REGULATION STATEMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted according to the principles of the &quot;Declaration of Helsinki&quot; (as&#xD;
      amended in Tokyo, Venice and Hong Kong, Somerset West and Edinburgh) and in accordance with&#xD;
      the Guideline for Good Clinical Practice (CPMP/ICH/135/95 - 17th July 1996).&#xD;
&#xD;
      10. ADMINISTRATIVE ASPECTS, MONITORING AND PUBLICATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Handling and storage of data and documents:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants are provided a study name of the letter &quot;MV&quot; followed by the number of&#xD;
      enrollment (1-50). The study name is coupled to a randomly chosen seven - digit study number.&#xD;
      The study number will be used to register the participant in the Electronic Patient Registry&#xD;
      of the LUMC. This file will be used as the general patient record, as well as collection of&#xD;
      routine laboratory measurements needed for clinical and study treatment. The MRI images will&#xD;
      be filed under this registry so that anonymity will be safeguarded. The subject&#xD;
      identification code list will be stored by the principal investigator and will only be&#xD;
      accessible by the principal investigator and project leader. The data extracted from the&#xD;
      study file in the Electronic Patient Registry and from the MRI images will be saved in an&#xD;
      SPSS file. From this file the true identity of the study participants can not be discovered.&#xD;
      The data will be stored for fifteen years. The blood samples will be frozen and stored&#xD;
      anonymously using the above mentioned study name and study number. For ad hoc laboratory&#xD;
      tests of inflammatory, endocrine and other biomarkers, blood samples will be kept for a&#xD;
      maximum period of three years. The blood samples are solely accessible by the investigator&#xD;
      team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to ensure that in medical emergencies, the study participation of the patient is&#xD;
      apparent, each patient will receive a patient file in the electronic patient registry. In&#xD;
      this personal file, the investigator will mention the study number of the patient including&#xD;
      the procedure for de-blinding and notification of the investigators. In this file, the signed&#xD;
      Informed Consent form of the patient will be stored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Public disclosure and publication policy: The data analysis will be performed by the&#xD;
      investigators. Novo Nordisk has no role in data analysis and / or publication of the results&#xD;
      of the trial in peer reviewed papers. The results of the study will be submitted to peer&#xD;
      reviewed papers, also in case the hypothesis has not been proven.&#xD;
