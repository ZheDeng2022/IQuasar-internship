    <textblock>
      Pneumonia remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults with&#xD;
      obstructive lung disease. Risk factors for pneumonia, including episodes associated with a&#xD;
      hospital admission, have been extensively characterized in clinical trials and observational&#xD;
      studies of patients with COPD, and include older age, lower predicted FEV1 (&lt;50%), prior COPD&#xD;
      exacerbations, dyspnea , normal to low body mass index (&lt;25), current smoking and certain&#xD;
      co-morbid conditions (e.g. dementia). The use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) has also been&#xD;
      identified, as associated with an increased risk of pneumonia in patients with COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to estimate the magnitude of known risk factors and&#xD;
      the outcomes of pneumonia requiring hospitalization and the potential effect modification of&#xD;
      these risk factors by ICS use. The primary endpoints will be severe pneumonia, defined as&#xD;
      community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) resulting in hospitalization and/or death and&#xD;
      hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) diagnosed after two days in the hospital. As a secondary&#xD;
      endpoint, CAP that did not result in hospitalization or death will be examined. As a&#xD;
      secondary objective, we will describe characteristics for those patients who develop&#xD;
      pneumonia requiring hospitalization compared to those with pneumonia not requiring admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will use the General Practice Online Database (GOLD), formerly referred to as the&#xD;
      General Practice research Database (GPRD), a primary care electronic medical record database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new user cohort will be defined among patients with COPD who are 45 years and older in the&#xD;
      United Kingdom. Patients will be considered a new user of ICS-containing medications if they&#xD;
      had not received a prescription for an ICS-containing medication in the prior year. The&#xD;
      comparator treatment group will be new users of long-acting bronchodilators (LABD), including&#xD;
      long-acting beta-agonists (LABA) or long-acting antimuscarinics (LAMA). In the one year&#xD;
      washout period, all new users could not have either ICS-containing medications or LABD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to conducting the analysis, feasibility analyses will be conducted to evaluate of the&#xD;
      number of pneumonia events and the number of new users separately to examine the available&#xD;
      precision based on the study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed from the date of their first eligible prescription (Cohort Entry&#xD;
      Date) until the earliest of the following: date of study end point (first pneumonia event of&#xD;
      interest), date of treatment end (up to 60-day gap allowed for each inhaler), date of&#xD;
      transfer to a new practice, date of ICS initiation (among LABD new users), death or study end&#xD;
      (end of available data). As part of the primary analysis, patients will be examined for their&#xD;
      first severe pneumonia (severe CAP, HAP). As a secondary analysis, time to non-severe CAP&#xD;
      will be examined. Incidence rates of the pneumonia outcomes will be calculated as the number&#xD;
      of patients experiencing an event divided by the person-years at risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multivariable analysis will be performed using Cox proportional hazard model with adjustment&#xD;
      for confounders and medication exposure. To adjust for differences confounding by severity&#xD;
      due to differences in prescribing between ICS-containing medications and LABD, propensity&#xD;
      scores (PS) will be utilized using inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW). The&#xD;
      propensity score will be estimated to model the probability of a patient receiving&#xD;
      ICS-containing medication prescription versus receiving a LABD prescription given a patient's&#xD;
      observed set of baseline covariates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effect modification (statistical interaction) will be evaluated based on available theory and&#xD;
      include ICS medication use by known risk factors for pneumonia (BMI&lt;21, BMI 21-24.9, BMI ≥25,&#xD;
      age, GOLD stage III/IV, MRC dyspnea score ≥4, history of pneumonia diagnosis, current smoking&#xD;
      status, social deprivation quartiles). Additional interactions may be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test proportionality of the hazard functions, model diagnostics will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare severe pneumonia with non-severe pneumonia in patients with COPD, characteristics&#xD;
      of patients experiencing non-severe CAP vs. severe CAP or HAP will be tabulated. To assess&#xD;
      differences between treatments, clinical and patient characteristics will be compared using&#xD;
      the chi-square tests or Wilcoxon tests for categorical or continuous data, respectively.&#xD;
      Severe CAP and HAP may be combined. Modeling of clinical and patient characteristics may be&#xD;
      considered using logistic regression using CAP vs. severe CAP and then with severe CAP vs.&#xD;
      HAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional analysis or adjustments to the analytic or modeling strategy will be performed if&#xD;
      the data warrants. A more detailed modeling strategy, including generation of the propensity&#xD;
      scores and Cox modeling, will be created in a separate analysis plan. Adjustments to the a&#xD;
      priori plan will be described in the final study report.&#xD;

      Advantages of the primary care database include the ability to link to secondary care,&#xD;
      Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), and to examine risk factors for pneumonia included in the&#xD;
      UK Quality Outcomes Framework for COPD that are not collected routinely in most other&#xD;
      observational healthcare data sources (e.g., BMI, lung function, smoking history, MRC dyspnea&#xD;
      score). Another advantage of this study is the new-user design, as it minimizes biases that&#xD;
      can be caused by alternative designs which compare events between prevalent user groups&#xD;
      (e.g., survivor bias, covariates altered by prior exposure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are also known limitations of observational database analyses where treatments are not&#xD;
      randomized, including the potential for confounding by severity that may not be fully&#xD;
      accounted for in the analysis. ICS-containing medications may be dispensed to patients who&#xD;
      have more severe COPD than patients who are receiving long-acting bronchodilators alone. In&#xD;
      this study, we will adjust for disease severity and patient characteristics in the period&#xD;
      prior to initiation using propensity scores. Medication use in CPRD-GOLD is based on&#xD;
      prescribed medications recorded by the primary care physician, which might not have been&#xD;
      dispensed at the pharmacy or ultimately utilized by the patient. Finally, diagnostic&#xD;
      practices for pneumonia may be different in the UK compared with other countries limiting the&#xD;
      generalizability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As with any outcome of interest, identifying pneumonia in databases is imperfect and there&#xD;
      may be confusion between diagnoses of pneumonia and influenza or serious exacerbation. To our&#xD;
      knowledge, the relationship between pneumonia recorded in these primary and secondary care&#xD;
      databases have not been investigated. In addition, there is lack of agreement between&#xD;
      pneumonia classification in the absence of chest x-rays, sputum, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the limitations, this study will provide insights into risk factors for serious&#xD;
      pneumonia, including whether ICS modify the effect of established risk factors for serious&#xD;
      pneumonia. The results may identify specific patient groups that are at greatest risk of&#xD;
      serious pneumonia and may identify where risk minimization and/or medical recommendations may&#xD;
      be appropriate.&#xD;

        Patients with COPD who are new users of ICS-containing medications or new user of LABD will&#xD;
        be included in the study if they are at least 45 years of age and have met the&#xD;
        inclusion/exclusion. Patients will have at least one prescription for ICS-containing&#xD;
        medications or LABD from January 2005 (the earliest use) until December, 2010 preceded by a&#xD;
        year of no use of these medicines . The one-year period of no use is referred to a washout&#xD;
        period rather than requiring no use of these medications ever in the patient's history.&#xD;
        Patients would be required to have at least one year in their history prior to new user&#xD;
        cohort entry to establish baseline disease severity and co-morbidities that would be&#xD;
