  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The SUGAR-MGH investigators are studying the influence of inherited gene variants on the&#xD;
      response to two commonly prescribed type 2 diabetes medications, metformin and glipizide.&#xD;
      They hypothesize that variants in genes that are associated with type 2 diabetes or related&#xD;
      traits may impact the effect of anti-diabetic medications. In addition, physiological&#xD;
      responses to an insulin secretagogue or an insulin sensitizer may shed light on the mechanism&#xD;
      of action of reported genetic associations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several common genetic variants have been reliably associated with type 2 diabetes and&#xD;
      related glycemic traits. Study investigators hypothesize that variants in genes that are&#xD;
      reproducibly associated with type 2 diabetes or related glycemic traits may impact the effect&#xD;
      of anti-diabetic medications. In particular, sulfonylureas may have differential effects on&#xD;
      individuals depending on the allelic variant they carry at KCNJ11 E23K; conversely, because&#xD;
      TCF7L2 is postulated to influence insulin secretion by regulating the action of glucagon-like&#xD;
      peptide 1 (GLP-1), and sulfonylureas act at a different step in the insulin secretion&#xD;
      pathway, the effect of sulfonylureas on insulin secretion could be independent of genetic&#xD;
      variation at TCF7L2. In addition, physiological responses to an insulin secretagogue or an&#xD;
      insulin sensitizer may shed light on the mechanism of action of reported genetic&#xD;
      associations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the convincing associations of several genetic variants with type 2 diabetes and&#xD;
      their involvement in physiological pathways involved in drug response, their impact on&#xD;
      pharmacological interventions has not been systematically examined. The completion of the&#xD;
      Human Genome Project and the high-density characterization of common human variation in four&#xD;
      different ethnic groups highlight the promise of genomic medicine. The elucidation of the&#xD;
      genetic architecture of complex phenotypes may help clinicians understand disease&#xD;
      heterogeneity, uncover new pathophysiological mechanisms, open the opportunity for novel&#xD;
      therapeutic interventions, provide predictive diagnostic and prognostic information, and&#xD;
      allow for individually tailored therapy that takes into account both the probability of&#xD;
      response and the incidence of drug-induced complications.&#xD;

    <description>On day 1, subjects will receive a single oral dose of glipizide 5 mg, and will have blood drawn at various time points for up to 240 minutes. During study days 2-7, the participants will fill out a dietary intake food record, including 3 weekdays and one weekend day. During days 6-8, the subject will receive a short-course metformin treatment of four 500-mg doses. On the morning of study day 8, 60 minutes after taking the fourth metformin dose, the subject will do a 75g Oral Glucose Tolerance Test. Blood draws will again be taken at time points for 120 minutes.</description>
