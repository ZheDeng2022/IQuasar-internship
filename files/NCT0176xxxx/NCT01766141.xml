    <textblock>
      It is expected that mechanical low back pain (LBP) is associated with inflammatory changes&#xD;
      localized to the affected tissues. Could such changes be detected in cells involved in the&#xD;
      inflammatory process in an in vitro model? The investigators wish to test such a model to&#xD;
      compare inflammatory markers in acute and chronic LBP patients and also examine the effect of&#xD;
      spinal manipulative treatment (SMT) on changing the level of selected key inflammatory&#xD;
      markers. The investigators hypothesize that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Proinflammatory markers will be elevated while antinflammatory markers will be reduced&#xD;
           in acute LBP patients relative to chronic back pain patients as well as in healthy study&#xD;
           participants who have no LBP or any inflammatory conditions (controls).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. SMT will cause a reduction in the production of proinflammatory markers while&#xD;
           anti-inflammatory markers will increase relative to baseline levels as well as relative&#xD;
           to controls&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background: Spinal manipulative treatment(SMT) may work by reducing mechanical irritation to&#xD;
      joint tissues (1) and thereby diminishing local inflammation. Evidence for an&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory effect of instrument-assisted SMT has been observed in an animal model (2).&#xD;
      These findings are consistent with the recently proposed hypothesis that the origin of all&#xD;
      pain may be associated with inflammation and augmented production of inflammatory mediators&#xD;
      (cytokines), principally TNFα (3). TNFα plays a major role in the pathophysiology of&#xD;
      neuropathic pain-associated inflammation (4) and has been implicated in spinal pain&#xD;
      syndromes, including intervertebral disc-related low back pain (5, 6) and sciatica (7,8). Our&#xD;
      recent studies demonstrated that production of inflammatory mediators is elevated in patients&#xD;
      with chronic cervical spine pain, both in vitro and in vivo, and accompanied by up-regulation&#xD;
      of chemokine (CC) synthesis (9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent reports on clinical (10), animal (2) and human in vitro models (11) suggest that SMT&#xD;
      may exert an anti-inflammatory effect. Thus, Song et al. (2) found that SMT reduced&#xD;
      inflammatory neuropathic pain. Teodorczyk-Injeyan et al. (11) demonstrated a significant&#xD;
      attenuation of pro-inflammatory cytokine production in vitro, and no changes in serum&#xD;
      substance P (SP) levels following SMT. Other studies from our laboratory showed that SMT may&#xD;
      enhance both the production of and the response to the immunomodulatory cytokine, IL-2, and&#xD;
      IL-2-dependent antibody synthesis (12, 13). Reduction in serum TNFα levels has been reported&#xD;
      for cervicogenic headache patients (n=2, case studies) (14, 15). These observations suggest&#xD;
      that SMT effects may be transduced into cellular components of the immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus far, the clinical relevance of the effect of SMT as a modulator of inflammatory mediator&#xD;
      production is unknown. Despite evidence of inflammatory pathophysiology of spinal pain (16),&#xD;
      including a subtype of non-specific spinal pain (17), only one clinical study (18) evaluated&#xD;
      the correlation between serum TNFα levels, pain intensity and back function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this proposed study we intend to use a clinical model to investigate the baseline levels&#xD;
      of proinflammatory cytokines in acute and chronic low back pain patients and explore the&#xD;
      potential anti-inflammatory effect of SMT following a course of manipulative treatments.&#xD;
      Thus, Aim 1 is to determine baseline pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in individuals&#xD;
      experiencing acute or chronic lower spinal pain of mechanical etiology, and compare them with&#xD;
      asymptomatic controls'. Aim 2 is to explore the relationships between SMT, pain level and&#xD;
      functional impairment, and the production of inflammatory mediators relative to baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10 and IL-1ra) have been found to be produced alongside, and&#xD;
      in parallel, with their respective pro-inflammatory counterparts (TNFα and IL-1β), and act in&#xD;
      concert to sustain/restore homeostasis (19). The proposed study will include determinations,&#xD;
      in addition to pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL-1, TNFα, IL-6) levels, of the levels of IL-1&#xD;
      receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) and IL-10. Assessment of IL-10 synthesis is particularly&#xD;
      relevant as this cytokine up-regulates the production of IL-1ra, which competes with active&#xD;
      IL-1 for binding to IL-1 receptors, and which acts as a potent natural anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      protein (19, 20).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design; Subject Recruitment: Subjects (volunteers) of both sexes, between the ages 20&#xD;
      and 60 years, experiencing acute (less than 4 weeks in duration) or chronic (12 weeks or&#xD;
      longer in duration) mechanical low back pain (experienced between spinal levels L1- L5, with&#xD;
      or without sacroiliac [SI] joint involvement) will be recruited by Canadian Memorial&#xD;
      Chiropractic College (CMCC) personnel and posters from CMCC's outpatient clinics, and from&#xD;
      the general public through newspaper advertisements . CMCC is in the Greater Toronto Area&#xD;
      (GTA), where the population is a diverse ethnic mix (21). Potential participants who have&#xD;
      presented to one of the CMCC clinics for the purpose of treatment will be&#xD;
      encouraged/recruited by interns/clinicians prior to commencement of treatments. Others who&#xD;
      present to participate in the research study will first be assigned to one of the clinic pods&#xD;
      for initial assessment prior to entering the study. In no case, however, will participants&#xD;
      have received SMT 4 weeks prior to commencement of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Candidates will be interviewed in order to determine eligibility (see exclusion criteria,&#xD;
      Appendix 1). They will complete the research intake form (Appendix 2) and be given detailed&#xD;
      explanations about the research protocol (Appendix 3). A cohort of matching healthy&#xD;
      asymptomatic subjects, recruited from the general population, will serve as controls for the&#xD;
      determination of baseline cytokine levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size determination: Data published for TNFα levels in chronic neck pain patients&#xD;
      versus asymptomatic controls (9) were used to calculate a sample size estimate for this&#xD;
      study. The study is powered for the primary outcome measure related to Question 1, looking at&#xD;
      the difference between symptomatic and asymptomatic low back pain subjects at baseline (see&#xD;
      Statistical Analyses). From Cohen's table (22), based on a power of 0.8, a two-tailed test&#xD;
      with a p value &lt; 0.05, the sample size was estimated to be 17 per group. In order to account&#xD;
      for drop-outs and errors that may arise in the blood cultures, the sample size will be&#xD;
      increased to 20 per group. As a result, there will be 40 symptomatic subjects and 20&#xD;
      asymptomatic controls, which should provide a more than adequate sample to test the primary&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject assessment and group assignment: Qualified subjects will be scheduled. They will be&#xD;
      greeted by one of two investigators (depending on recruitment site) , who will brief them and&#xD;
      review the intake/eligibility form (Appendix 3) to confirm their eligibility before asking&#xD;
      them to sign the informed consent form (Appendix 4). All subjects will then be asked to&#xD;
      indicate their pain intensity level on the 10-point visual analogue scale (VAS) and complete&#xD;
      the Oswestry functional disability questionnaire. They will then be assessed with standard&#xD;
      chiropractic, orthopaedic and neurological tests by their respective chiropractic interns and&#xD;
      supervising clinicians, who will assign them to the acute or chronic LBP groups, and who will&#xD;
      formulate and explain a treatment plan.. For the duration of the study, treatments will&#xD;
      consist of manual SMT and, where needed, manual (not instrument-assisted) soft tissue work&#xD;
      provided by the clinician. Other treatment modalities will not be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive 6 treatments over the course of 2 weeks. (comprised of manipulation of&#xD;
      one lumbar or sacroiliac articulation, with or without soft tissue therapy). SMT will consist&#xD;
      of a single high velocity, low amplitude (HVLA) thrust intended to cavitate and restore&#xD;
      mobility to the joint. If at initial presentation a manipulative segment could not be&#xD;
      identified, the patient will be excluded from the study. If on the other hand a manipulable&#xD;
      segment is not found at subsequent visits, the clinician will limit the treatment to&#xD;
      palpation and some soft tissue work as indicated . In all cases a blood sample will be drawn&#xD;
      (see below) after initial assessment and prior to commencement of treatments of patients, in&#xD;
      order to establish a baseline level of cytokines for each participant (primary outcome). At&#xD;
      their 7th visit (at least 2 days after last treatment), a blood sample will be taken prior to&#xD;
      commencement of any further treatment, and they will be asked to complete the exit&#xD;
      questionnaire including a VAS (Appendix 5). Should a patient recover following a few&#xD;
      treatments, as assessed by subjective feedback from the patient and a VAS result of less than&#xD;
      3/10, then a blood sample will be taken earlier and such will be duly noted. Should a patient&#xD;
      require continued treatments beyond the 6 stipulated by the study, s/he will be free to do so&#xD;
      under the direction of the clinician in charge of their case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: Manipulation: As noted above, each spinal manipulation will consist of a HVLA&#xD;
      thrust to an affected segment (23). A clinician will deliver treatments according to his/her&#xD;
      assessment findings on a given day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Venipuncture: On the day of admission into the study and at the completion of SMT therapy, an&#xD;
      experienced phlebotomist will perform venipuncture using standard procedures (antecubital&#xD;
      fossa, 21gauge needle) in the seated position. Heparinized blood samples (10 ml each) will be&#xD;
      collected and transferred (at room temperature) to the laboratory within an hour of&#xD;
      collection for the preparation of whole blood cultures as described below .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory studies&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Induction of inflammatory cytokines To assess cytokine production in vitro, a whole&#xD;
           blood (WB) culture system will be utilized (19). Briefly, multiple sets of WB cultures&#xD;
           representing different treatment/culture conditions for each subject will be prepared.&#xD;
           Cultures will be stimulated at initiation with 10 μg/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for the&#xD;
           induction of TNFα and IL-1β production. Phytohemagglutinin (PHA, 10 µg/ml) alone and in&#xD;
           combination with LPS will be used to induce production of the anti-inflammatory&#xD;
           cytokine, IL-10 and 2 chemokines, CCL2 and CCL3 . Cultures will be maintained at 37C&#xD;
           (Celsius) in a humidified 5% C02 incubator. As clinical conditions involving&#xD;
           inflammatory responses may cause a time shift in the capacity for cytokine production&#xD;
           (19, 27), the levels of the studied mediators (TNFα, IL-1β, IL-1ra, IL-10, CCL2 and&#xD;
           CCL3) will be examined at 24 h intervals in culture supernatants harvested between&#xD;
           24-72h post-initiation. Aliquots of the supernatants will be stored at -76C (Celsius)&#xD;
           until tested. This model will allow investigation of the relation between the releases&#xD;
           of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determinations of cytokine levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay The levels of&#xD;
           TNFα, IL-1β , and IL-10 and IL-1ra in supernatants from whole blood cultures will be&#xD;
           determined by specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) using DuoSet ELISA&#xD;
           development system for natural and recombinant human cytokines (R&amp;D Systems,&#xD;
           Minneapolis, MN) as described previously (9, 11), and Quantikine Immunoassay Kits will&#xD;
           be used for CCL2 and CCL3 determinations. All immunoassay procedures, including reagent&#xD;
           and sample diluent preparations, will be carried out as per manufacturer's&#xD;
           recommendations. Each of the studied samples will be tested at least twice at 2-4&#xD;
           different dilutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses All of the studied mediators will be measured for the LBP patients and&#xD;
      asymptomatic subjects at baseline and at the completion of the treatment period. For Question&#xD;
      1 (the primary outcome), baseline comparison for each TNFα and IL-1β will be compared between&#xD;
      symptomatic subjects (acute and chronic) versus asymptomatic control subjects. Two unpaired&#xD;
      t-tests will be used to test the associated hypothesis. For Question 2, the mean pre-post&#xD;
      difference scores will be compared for each of TNFα and IL-1β between the three groups&#xD;
      (acute, chronic and asymptomatic) using an ANOVA. If baseline values are significantly&#xD;
      different between groups (as hypothesized from Question 1), then ANCOVA will be used to&#xD;
      account for this difference. It is anticipated that the sample size is sufficiently large to&#xD;
      accommodate this analysis. However, after determining the results for Question 2, a power&#xD;
      analysis will be completed. If the study is insufficiently powered for this question, then&#xD;
      another sample size estimate will be calculated to inform future work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For other pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines measured in this study, regression&#xD;
      modeling will be used in an attempt to predict cytokine responses. It is understood that any&#xD;
      model created during this process will need to be confirmed in a future investigation. Both&#xD;
      models created and descriptive data derived from the investigation will be used to inform&#xD;
      future work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time frame Based on experience, up to 5 subjects per week can be tested. However, based on&#xD;
      condition prevalence, we project that patient recruitment and sample collection will take&#xD;
      8-12 months. Cytokine level determinations in cell cultures derived from the three groups of&#xD;
      participants will lag behind by 3-4 months, and data analysis will be completed within&#xD;
      another 2 months. Preparation of manuscripts will require an additional 4-6 months. Thus we&#xD;
      anticipate completing this project within 18 -24 months of initiation of the study.&#xD;
