  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) literature focuses on clinical outcomes in the&#xD;
      adult population. However, SBRT has a particularly strong rationale for application in&#xD;
      pediatrics given that high biologically effective doses have been shown to increase control&#xD;
      in histologies, such as sarcoma, which are common in the pediatrics population. With&#xD;
      stereotactic radiation therapy techniques, a reduction in normal tissue dose surrounding the&#xD;
      target lesion of interest may also be accomplished resulting in lower toxicity. Given that&#xD;
      pediatric patients with sarcomas, presenting with limited metastases in lung and bone, are&#xD;
      still considered to be a curable population with aggressive local therapy, SBRT could have a&#xD;
      significant impact on outcomes in oligometastatic patients who may be otherwise unresectable.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric patients with sarcoma who have limited metastases are still potentially curable&#xD;
      with aggressive local therapy. However, conventional moderate dose radiation is unlikely to&#xD;
      provide durable local control. Given the recent technologic advances in radiation delivery,&#xD;
      it is now possible to deliver tumoricidal doses, using stereotactic radiation over a short&#xD;
      time course with highly focal techniques. Stereotactic radiation has proven efficacious in&#xD;
      the intracranial setting and in multiple extracranial sites in adults. It has not yet been&#xD;
      well studied in the pediatrics population where there is a particularly strong rationale due&#xD;
      to the ablative doses that can be delivered to tumor while simultaneously reducing high dose&#xD;
      to normal tissues. The proposed trial is a single arm phase II study to determine the&#xD;
      efficacy of SBRT in pediatric sarcomas with surgically unresectable metastatic disease.&#xD;
      Oligometastatic sites eligible for treatment in this study include bony sites of disease.&#xD;
      SBRT will be delivered to each eligible site to a total dose of 4000 delivered in 5 fractions&#xD;
      of 800 per fractions each day. Following completion of SBRT, patients will undergo treatment&#xD;
      response assessment with the use of diagnostic imaging, clinical examination, and completion&#xD;
      of the Brief Pain Inventory to assess quality of life. The primary objective of this study is&#xD;
      to determine the efficacy of SBRT delivered to a dose of 4000 centigray (cGy) in 5 fractions&#xD;
      of 800 cGy each for patients greater than 3 years of age and &lt; 40 years of age with&#xD;
      metastatic disease of bone secondary to pediatric sarcoma. The secondary objectives of this&#xD;
      study include describing the toxicity of SBRT with this regimen; assessing clinical response&#xD;
      rate of each target lesion; assessing long-term clinical outcomes; and assessing quality of&#xD;
      life following completion of treatment. For patients with potentially curable oligometastatic&#xD;
      disease, surgical resection in conjunction with systemic therapy remains the standard of&#xD;
      care. Patients on this study will continue to receive chemotherapy outside of the 2 week&#xD;
      window for SBRT. Issues that may limit participation include our inability to assess late&#xD;
      effects that may not develop till at least 10 years after therapy. For this reason, we will&#xD;
      limit the population in this study to patients who are surgically unresectable and would be&#xD;
      otherwise incurable with current standard systemic therapies.&#xD;

    <time_frame>6 months post-SBRT</time_frame>
    <description>Local control was defined as the absence of local progression. Local progression was defined as:&#xD;
(1) the development of a new soft tissue mass ≥1 cm at a site without a soft tissue component or with a soft tissue component &lt;1 cm in at baseline&#xD;
(2) an increase in the largest axial dimension of the soft tissue component by &gt;20% in lesions with a ≥ 1 cm in soft tissue component at baseline&#xD;
(3) a previous bone metastasis that was avid on fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET), became non-avid after SBRT, and then became avid again.&#xD;
The Kaplan-Meier method was used.</description>

          <description>This is a single-arm, prospective trial to examine the efficacy and safety of SBRT (SBRT) for the treatment of bone metastases in pediatric and young adult patients. Patients with metastatic nonrhabdomyosarcoma with bone metastases were treated with SBRT to a total dose of 40 Gy in 5 fractions (8 Gy/fraction). Physicians were permitted to treat up to five distinct lesions per patient.</description>

        <description>Local control was defined as the absence of local progression. Local progression was defined as:&#xD;
(1) the development of a new soft tissue mass ≥1 cm at a site without a soft tissue component or with a soft tissue component &lt;1 cm in at baseline&#xD;
(2) an increase in the largest axial dimension of the soft tissue component by &gt;20% in lesions with a ≥ 1 cm in soft tissue component at baseline&#xD;
(3) a previous bone metastasis that was avid on fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET), became non-avid after SBRT, and then became avid again.&#xD;
The Kaplan-Meier method was used.</description>

          <title>Change in Quality of Life (QoL) as Assessed by the Brief Pain Inventory</title>
          <description>Quality of life was assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) form which assesses the severity of pain and impact on functioning on an 11-point scale at each follow up visit. Paired sample Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were performed to assess changes in pain scores on the Brief Pain Inventory; 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst pain.</description>
          <population>BPI forms were completed for 10 patients at baseline and one-month post-SBRT.</population>
