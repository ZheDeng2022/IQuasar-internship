  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if the investigators can improve the treatment of this&#xD;
      type of cancer. They want to find out what effects, good and/or bad, giving heated&#xD;
      chemotherapy into the belly, known as hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC), has&#xD;
      on the patient and this type of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of HIPEC is to expose any cancer left in the abdomen after surgery to high doses of&#xD;
      chemotherapy. The chemotherapy is heated in the hope that this will make it easier for it to&#xD;
      get into and kill the cancer cells. The drug used for HIPEC will be carboplatin, a Food and&#xD;
      Drug Administration (FDA) approved drug for use in ovarian, fallopian tube or primary&#xD;
      peritoneal cancer.&#xD;
