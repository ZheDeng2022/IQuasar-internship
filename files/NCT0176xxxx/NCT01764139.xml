    <textblock>
      Vitamin D deficiency has long been linked to musculoskeletal pain, and many other chronic&#xD;
      disease conditions. Vitamin D is a nutrient that functions as a hormone precursor, and&#xD;
      wide-ranging health effects are supported by the presence of vitamin D receptors in several&#xD;
      cell types and tissues of the body (eg, lymphocytes and monocytes, brain, heart, pancreas,&#xD;
      intestine, and placenta).In addition to its essential role of maintaining bone health,&#xD;
      hypovitaminosis D has been implicated in the development of serious conditions, including&#xD;
      diabetes, various types of cancer, and cardiovascular diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin D is a unique prohormone that humans obtain in small amount from food, dietary&#xD;
      supplements and largely by endogenous skin synthesis from 7-dehydrocholesterol with sunlight&#xD;
      exposure. This endogenous synthesis produces the form vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol).Vitamin D&#xD;
      deficiency and insufficiency are very common in the UK. Local audit at Chelmsford has shown&#xD;
      severe deficiency of vitamin D among chronic pain patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major source of vitamin D synthesis relies on sunlight exposure which is likely to be&#xD;
      affected by modern lifestyles, which increasingly involve working indoors during daylight&#xD;
      hours. This may be particularly important when combined with residence in northern latitudes&#xD;
      and a cloudy climate.The proposed pilot study aims to identify percentage of vitamin D&#xD;
      deficiency among knee pain patients by investigating eligible patients' blood for '25 hydroxy&#xD;
      vitamin D'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      English speaking patients whose knee pain has not been resolved following knee arthroscopy&#xD;
      are eligible for the study. Study will be carried out at the Broomfield hospital chronic pain&#xD;
      department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration will be around 6 months.&#xD;

      Introduction Vitamin D deficiency has recently been linked with a range of diseases including&#xD;
      chronic pain. Range of vitamin D levels are classified as deficiency less than 50nmols,&#xD;
      insufficient 50 to 75 nmols, and adequate 75 to 150 nmoles, excessive more than 150nmol.&#xD;
      Vitamin D deficiency was also identified in some of the chronic pain patients who presented&#xD;
      to our pain clinic at Broomfield hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency are very common in the UK. Local audit at Chelmsford&#xD;
      has shown severe deficiency of vitamin D among chronic pain patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major source of vitamin D synthesis relies on sunlight exposure which is likely to be&#xD;
      affected by modern lifestyles, or increasingly working indoors during daylight hours. This&#xD;
      may be particularly important when combined with residence in northern latitudes and a cloudy&#xD;
      climate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observational and circumstantial evidence suggests that there may be a role for vitamin D&#xD;
      treatment for some chronic pain conditions. Al-Jarallah &amp;colleagues had showed that (25(OH) D&#xD;
      level was 11.4 Â± 6.07 ng/ml.) 92.9% were vitamin D deficient among their Kuwaiti patients&#xD;
      with primary knee osteoarthritis (21).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our aim is to identify how many percentages of our patients, who are having knee pain,&#xD;
      without any major abnormal findings are deficient of vitamin D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If this number is significant, can we supplement them to improve their pain? If we correctly&#xD;
      supplement patients early enough, can we prevent further deterioration of their knee joint?&#xD;
      These are some of the questions we may be able to investigate and treat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently the investigations of vitamin D levels were done on patients with primary knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis and to assess its relation with radiological grading and functional status,&#xD;
      but not to assess the relationship with pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Aims, hypotheses We aim to identify incidence of vitamin D deficiency among knee&#xD;
      pain patients. If this proves significant, next step is to organise a trial to treat these&#xD;
      patients to identify the effectiveness of adequate supplementation for relieving pain. Our&#xD;
      aim is to investigate around 50 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment English speaking patients whose knee pain has not been resolved following knee&#xD;
      arthroscopy will be invited to the study. Sample size will be only 50 patients. Patients will&#xD;
      explain the purpose of the study in plain English before the invitation. After giving&#xD;
      informed consent, sample of blood will be taken for '25hydroxy vitamin D' levels. Study will&#xD;
      be carried out at the Broomfield hospital chronic pain department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria Male &amp; no pregnant female age between 18-40 yrs, who continue to&#xD;
      experience knee pain following normal to Grade 2 knee arthroscopy findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria Any types of anatomical or neurological causes for the pain, history of&#xD;
      seizures, regional pain syndrome, alcohol or drug abuse, and malignancy, patients with&#xD;
      clinically significant diseases and patients who do not understand English will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention or procedure One blood sample per patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management and analysis The proportion of patients with vitamin D deficiency will be&#xD;
      estimated from the data and the corresponding 95% confidence limits calculated using the&#xD;
      Wilson method. The mean and standard deviation of the vitamin D level will be estimated from&#xD;
      the data along with the corresponding 95% confidence limits obtained using a bootstrap with&#xD;
      999 samples. The statistical distribution of the vitamin D level will also be examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measure for the study To identify the percentages of Vitamin D deficiency&#xD;
      among the knee pain patients&#xD;
