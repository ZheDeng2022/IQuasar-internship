  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To search for suitable pharmacodynamic biomarkers, i.e., with high specificity for&#xD;
      calcineurin inhibition and most affected by inter-individual variability, our works aimed at&#xD;
      exploring the pharmacodynamics of CNI, the strength and variability of signal translation&#xD;
      along the calcineurin pathway, as well as the steps where sources of internal (genetic) or&#xD;
      external variability are the most influential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to achieve this, we assessed simultaneously NFAT1 translocation into the nucleus of&#xD;
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) (NFTA1 being the main NAFT isoform in resting and&#xD;
      activated lymphocytes), the intracellular expression of IL-2 in CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell&#xD;
      subsets and the membrane expression of CD25 (IL-2Rα), a surface marker of T cells activation,&#xD;
      in T cells at large. A non-interventional clinical trial was set up in healthy volunteers,&#xD;
      patients registered on a liver transplantation waiting list (WLP) and liver transplant&#xD;
      recipients (LTR). A different question was addressed in each group: The healthy volunteer&#xD;
      study (n=35): explored TAC PD along the calcineurin pathway by exposing PBMC ex-vivo;&#xD;
      modelled signal translation along this cascade; examined the interindividual variability of&#xD;
      TAC PD parameters; and investigated the sources of the variability observed and their&#xD;
      contribution at each step of the calcineurin pathway. Furthermore, it allowed us to evaluate&#xD;
      the analytical variability of our techniques as well as the intra-individual variability of&#xD;
      TAC PD parameters. WLP (n=19) were enrolled to confirm in patients with liver diseases the&#xD;
      results obtained in healthy volunteers, as well as to test the potential influence of their&#xD;
      initial disease on the ex-vivo pharmacodynamics of TAC. The aims of the transversal study of&#xD;
      LTR on CNI (n=80) were to further explore the interindividual variability in the PD of CNI in&#xD;
      realistic clinical conditions, i.e. in situations of residual PD activities under tacrolimus&#xD;
      or cyclosporine exposure, and the potential pharmacogenetic (PG) sources of such variability.&#xD;
      The (still small) group of liver transplant patients (n=9) enrolled immediately before&#xD;
      transplantation and followed-up with serial monitoring along the first year&#xD;
      post-transplantation was intended to explore the relationships between CNI PD and clinical&#xD;
      responses.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research will be conducted under the rules of Good Clinical Practice, Good Laboratory&#xD;
      Practice of the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH)and the Principles of&#xD;
      Declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Groups of study are included once inclusion/exclusion criteria were verified and after&#xD;
      written informed consent was given: healthy volunteers, patients of the waiting list for&#xD;
      liver transplantation, liver transplant recipients on tacrolimus and cyclosporine and a&#xD;
      longitudinal cohort of patients enrolled since the waiting list for transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From this instance proceed the sampling plan. Considering potential dropouts or withdrawals&#xD;
      during the study, the intention is to recruit an additional 10% to compensate for the&#xD;
      cohorts, as they allow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design does not suppose applying masking methods, since it is an open study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data required in the registration forms will be recorded, however in case of persistent&#xD;
      failure, will be properly documented the reasons for the absence. Each instance will merit a&#xD;
      particular analysis, dated and signed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Models could be used to estimate the impact of bias due to potential missing data, and if&#xD;
      applicable will be complemented with a sensibility analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Loading data will be conducted electronically. Data will be validated according to the data&#xD;
      management plan, jointly defined by the principal investigator and the biostatistician,&#xD;
      including freezing and thawing processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic, pharmacogenetic and pharmacodynamic modeling will be done using R software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data back ups will be run everyday, and will be archived on tape and a USB storage drive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides self monitoring procedures, the study may be audited by the health authority (during&#xD;
      the course of the study or even when it is completed), to assess compliance with the&#xD;
      standards of Good Clinical Practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atypical results if any, will be handled according to the criteria of results outside of&#xD;
      specification. If re-analysis of samples will occur, they will be properly documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation includes the percentage of occurrence of acute cellular rejection and&#xD;
      adverse events, as reported by the National Liver Transplant Program and the possible rates&#xD;
      of abandonment or premature retirement of the in study subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under national rates, will be studied at least 30 healthy volunteers, 50 patients and 12&#xD;
      patients with end stage liver disease enlisted for liver transplantation, with serial&#xD;
      follow-up during the first year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be performed according to the principle of &quot;intention to treat&quot;,&#xD;
      and will be the responsible for at least one specialist in biostatistics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be developed a descriptive analysis of all variables collected. Categorical variables&#xD;
      will be expressed in percentages and number of observations. Continuous variables will be&#xD;
      expressed as mean and coefficient of variation or median and 25th and 75th percentiles,&#xD;
      minimum and maximum. Lof transformations will be held whenever needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The variables will be compared between groups according to the patient's original listing&#xD;
      (intention to treat). They will be calculated and presented the estimated relative risks and&#xD;
      their effect with 95% confidence intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For comparison of categorical variables, it will be used the Chi-square test or Fisher's&#xD;
      exact test as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For comparison of continuous variables, it will be used the test &quot;t&quot; of Student.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For variables that develop with time, they will be represented by Kaplan-Meier curves and&#xD;
      compared using the &quot;log-rank&quot; test. Their relative risk with 95% confidence interval will be&#xD;
      calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify variables associated with different responses multivariate linear analysis,&#xD;
      logistic or Cox proportional will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All analyzes will be performed with hypothesis testing and a 2-tailed significance level of&#xD;
      5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The program used will be R. Multivariate analysis will be held corrected according&#xD;
      Bonferroni's criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have established standard operating procedures to describe blood collection instances,&#xD;
      biological fluids sampling circuit, evaluation of the candidates to include in the study,&#xD;
      verification of the inclusion criteria, monitoring of patients during the study, record of&#xD;
      undesirable events and report of adverse drug reactions, terminating tracking.&#xD;
