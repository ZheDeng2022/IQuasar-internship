      Objective: Demonstrate the safety of early use of dabigatran following TIA/minor stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Although aggressive antithrombotic therapy has been shown to reduce the number of&#xD;
      new ischemic events following stroke/TIA, this has always been offset by an increase in the&#xD;
      risk of hemorrhagic transformation. Dabigatran is much safer than previously tested&#xD;
      antithrombotic agents, with respect to intracranial bleeding and therefore offers a unique&#xD;
      treatment opportunity in these high-risk patients. TIA/minor stroke represent the largest&#xD;
      group of cerebrovascular disease patients. A short-term intervention such as 30 days of&#xD;
      dabigatran treatment has the potential for a very large impact from the population health&#xD;
      perspective, given the number of patients who may be treated if a benefit can be&#xD;
      demonstrated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open label, single arm study. Patients with TIA/minor stroke (National Institutes&#xD;
      of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score &lt;/=3) who can be treated within 24 hours of symptom&#xD;
      onset will be eligible. All patients will be treated with dabigatran for 30 days. The dose of&#xD;
      dabigatran will be determined by age and renal function (patients &gt;80 years old and/or with&#xD;
      GFR 30-50 ml/min will received 110 mg bid, and all other patients will receive 150 mg&#xD;
      BID).The primary endpoint is symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation. Patients (n=50) with&#xD;
      TIA/minor stroke, defined as having a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale Score of&#xD;
      &lt;/=3, will undergo an MRI, including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), as well as gradient&#xD;
      recall echo (GRE) sequences, which will be used to assess for hemorrhagic transformation.&#xD;
      Patients will have a repeat MRI examination at 7 and 30 days to assess for hemorrhagic&#xD;
      transformation and new lesion development. The primary endpoint of of phase I is symptomatic&#xD;
      hemorrhagic transformation, defined as a parenchymal hematoma on the day 7 MRI scan (GRE&#xD;
      sequence), associated with clinical worsening (&gt;/=4 point increase in National Institutes of&#xD;
      Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If dabigatran can be used safely in this population, a second phase aimed at demonstrating&#xD;
      the rate of new ischemic lesion development following TIA can be reduced with aggressive&#xD;
      antithrombotic therapy. A randomized open-label, blinded endpoint evaluation design will be&#xD;
      employed. The investigators hypothesize that dabigatran therapy administered within 24 hours&#xD;
      of symptom onset will reduce the rate of new ischemic lesions, relative to standard care, one&#xD;
      week and 30 days after onset.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background: A transient ischemic attack (TIA) has traditionally been defined as a focal&#xD;
      neurologic deficit lasting less than 24 hours, but alternative definitions based on tissue&#xD;
      injury have been more recently proposed.1 This clinical definition has been based on the&#xD;
      assumption that TIAs are associated with complete resolution of brain ischemia occurring&#xD;
      rapidly enough to cause only transient symptoms and no permanent brain injury, i.e. stroke. A&#xD;
      recently completed MRI research study at the University of Alberta indicates that TIA and&#xD;
      minor stroke actually represent a continuum of symptoms secondary to brain ischemia.2 There&#xD;
      is also substantial evidence that the period shortly after a TIA or minor stroke is one of&#xD;
      elevated recurrent stroke risk; as high as 17% at 3 months.3, 4 We have previously reported&#xD;
      that MRI markers of new infarction are actually present within 7 days of the index event in&#xD;
      18% of patients.2 TIA and minor stroke can therefore be seen as a sentinel warning for&#xD;
      impending major stroke, which offers a potential window for therapeutic intervention. Given&#xD;
      the large number of patients who suffer a TIA/minor stroke, it is important to identify and&#xD;
      target those patients at highest risk for early recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of Minor Stroke/TIA: A logical approach to prevent early recurrence is aggressive&#xD;
      hyperacute antithrombotic therapy following TIA/minor stroke, as is now the standard of care&#xD;
      in acute coronary syndrome management. This treatment strategy is aimed at preventing both&#xD;
      recurrent thromboembolism and propagation of existing thrombi. In acute coronary syndrome&#xD;
      patients, antithrombotic therapy consists of both anticoagulants (low molecular weight&#xD;
      heparin) and combination antiplatelet agents (ASA+high dose clopidogrel, or more recently&#xD;
      prasugrel/ticagrelor). In ischemic stroke patients the benefits of traditional&#xD;
      anticoagulants, particularly heparin, have been consistently offset by an increased incidence&#xD;
      of intracranial hemorrhagic complications.5 Combination antiplatelet therapy is sometimes&#xD;
      used empirically following TIA/minor stroke, although this may not be an ideal approach&#xD;
      either. A previous trial in 392 patients demonstrated a trend towards reduction of recurrent&#xD;
      events by day 90 when patients were treated with a combination of ASA and clopidogrel for 90&#xD;
      days (Absolute Risk Reduction = 3.3% [95% CI -1.9, 9.4]), but this was also complicated by&#xD;
      excess hemorrhagic events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran is a very effective antithrombotic agent that has&#xD;
      been shown to be superior to warfarin in the prevention of cardioembolic ischemic stroke.&#xD;
      Dabigatran is unique in that unlike other antithrombotic drugs studied in cerebrovascular&#xD;
      disease, it appears to be associated with a much lower risk of intracranial hemorrhagic&#xD;
      complications, including intracerebral and subdural hemorrhages.7 This therefore appears to&#xD;
      be an ideal drug for treatment of acute cerebrovascular syndrome patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI as a Surrogate Outcome Marker in TIA/Minor Stroke: Our previous serial MRI study&#xD;
      indicates that the rate of new DWI lesion development in a TIA and minor stroke population is&#xD;
      22% at 30 days and more importantly 92% of these lesions developed within the first 7 days&#xD;
      after the initial symptoms.2 The majority (90%) of patients who developed new lesions had&#xD;
      baseline DWI lesions and all had areas of hypoperfusion evident on perfusion images. Thus&#xD;
      stroke 'recurrence' in fact appears to represent completion of the natural history of an&#xD;
      acute cerebrovascular syndrome. Having identified this high-risk group of patients, we now&#xD;
      aim to reduce the rate of development of new lesions. DWI lesion load has been shown to be&#xD;
      highly predictive of neurological and functional recovery following ischemic stroke, making&#xD;
      this an ideal surrogate outcome marker in smaller phase IIa studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have designed a two-phase study aimed at demonstrating the safety (phase I)&#xD;
      and efficacy (phase II) of acute dabigatran treatment following TIA/minor ischemic stroke.&#xD;
      Phase I is described below. The final design of phase II will be dependent on the results of&#xD;
      Phase I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Aim and Design Phase I: The primary aim of phase I is to demonstrate the safety of&#xD;
      early use of dabigatran following TIA/minor stroke. Phase I is an open label, single arm&#xD;
      study. Patients with TIA/minor stroke (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS)&#xD;
      score &gt;/=3) who can be treated within 24 hours of symptom onset will be eligible. All&#xD;
      patients will be treated with dabigatran for 30 days. The dose of dabigatran will be&#xD;
      determined by age and renal function (patients &gt;80 years old and/or with GFR 30-50 ml/min&#xD;
      will received 110 mg bid, and all other patients will receive 150 mg BID).The primary&#xD;
      endpoint is symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation. Patients (n=50) with TIA/minor stroke,&#xD;
      defined as having a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale Score of &lt;/=3, will undergo an&#xD;
      MRI, including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), as well as gradient recall echo (GRE)&#xD;
      sequences, which will be used to assess for hemorrhagic transformation. Patients will have a&#xD;
      repeat MRI examination at 7 and 30 days to assess for hemorrhagic transformation and new&#xD;
      lesion development. The primary endpoint of of phase I is symptomatic hemorrhagic&#xD;
      transformation, defined as a parenchymal hematoma on the day 7 MRI scan (GRE sequence),&#xD;
      associated with clinical worsening (&gt;/=4 point increase in National Institutes of Health&#xD;
      Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: Phase I is an open label, single arm study. The primary endpoint is symptomatic&#xD;
      hemorrhagic transformation. A total of 50 patients will be treated with dabigatran. A priori&#xD;
      stopping rules, based on the expected number of patients experiencing hemorrhagic&#xD;
      transformation in a group this size, will be employed.&#xD;
