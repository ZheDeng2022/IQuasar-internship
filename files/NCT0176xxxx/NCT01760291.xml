        Subjects will be excluded from the study if they meet any of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The subject requires long-term warfarin therapy (i.e., even if the device is&#xD;
             implanted, the subjects would not be eligible to discontinue warfarin due to other&#xD;
             medical conditions requiring chronic warfarin therapy). Additionally, a subject with&#xD;
             any of the following is excluded:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Thrombosis occurring at a young age (&lt;40 years old)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Idiopathic or recurrent venous thromboembolism&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Family history of venous thromboembolism or of inherited prothrombotic disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Recurrence or extension of thrombosis while adequately anticoagulated&#xD;
&#xD;

             warfarin therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The subject is contraindicated or allergic to aspirin&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The subject is indicated for antiplatelet therapy other than aspirin (for example, a&#xD;
             subject indicated for clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticlopidine or ticagrelor due to DES is&#xD;
             excluded from enrollment during the dosing regimen). A subject completing a course of&#xD;
             antiplatelet therapy may be enrolled after a 7 day washout period&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The subject had any interventional or surgical procedure within 30 days prior to&#xD;
             enrollment or is planning to have an interventional or surgical procedure in the time&#xD;
             between the WATCHMAN device implant and 45-day TEE (e.g., cardioversion, ablation,&#xD;
             cataract surgery, dental surgery)&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The subject had a prior stroke or TIA within the 90 days prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. The subject has had an MI within 90 days prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. The subject has a history of atrial septal repair or has an ASD/PFO device&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. The subject has an implanted mechanical valve prosthesis&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. The subject suffers from New York Heart Association Class IV Congestive Heart Failure&#xD;
             at the time of enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. The subject has symptomatic carotid disease (defined as &gt;50% stenosis with symptoms of&#xD;
             ipsilateral transient or visual TIA evidenced by amaurosis fugax, ipsilateral&#xD;
             hemispheric TIAs or ipsilateral stroke); if subject has a history of carotid stent or&#xD;
             endarterectomy the subject is eligible if there is &lt; 50% stenosis&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. The subject's AF is defined by a single occurrence of AF&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. The subject had a transient case of AF (i.e., secondary to CABG, interventional&#xD;
             procedure, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;

             hemoglobin concentration of &lt; 10 g/dl (i.e., anemia as determined by the investigator&#xD;
             which would require transfusion)&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. The subject is actively enrolled in a concurrent clinical study of an investigational&#xD;
             drug or investigational device (study specifics may be reviewed with the sponsor prior&#xD;
             to enrollment to confirm a concurrent study will not interfere with the outcomes of&#xD;
             this study)&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. The subject participated in any of the following studies: PROTECT AF, CAP Registry, or&#xD;
             PREVAIL. If the subject received a subject ID number for a prior WATCHMAN study, the&#xD;
             subject may not be enrolled. PROTECT AF control subjects may be considered for&#xD;
             participation if they have completed 5 year follow up&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. The subject is pregnant or pregnancy is planned during the course of the investigation&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. The subject has intracardiac thrombus or dense spontaneous echo contrast as visualized&#xD;
             by TEE and determined by the echocardiographer within 2 days prior to implant&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The subject has an existing pericardial effusion &gt; 2mm&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The subject has a high risk patent foramen ovale (PFO) with an atrial septal aneurysm&#xD;
             excursion &gt; 15mm or length &gt; 15mm&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The subject has a high risk PFO with a large shunt defined as early, within 3 beats or&#xD;
             substantial passage of bubbles&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The subject has significant mitral valve stenosis (i.e., MV &lt;1.5 cm2)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. The subject has complex atheroma with mobile plaque of the descending aorta or aortic&#xD;
             arch&#xD;
