  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the combination of oral cyclosporine, an immune&#xD;
      therapy and oral omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, are effective in rendering insulin&#xD;
      independence among recent onset type 1 diabetes patients. This two-arm study is designed to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and efficacy for insulin independence of two FDA and EMA-approved&#xD;
      therapies among recent onset type 1 diabetes patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the greatest new insights of today in the field of type 1 diabetes, is the&#xD;
      understanding that in man, unlike the success seen in type 1 diabetes mouse models, there is&#xD;
      no beta cell regeneration with immune therapy alone. In man, type 1 diabetes is now&#xD;
      considered to be a disease of both autoimmunity and lack of beta cell regeneration (Levetan&#xD;
      2103).&#xD;
&#xD;
      More than 500 patients with new onset type 1 diabetes have been given cyclosporine and some&#xD;
      studies have demonstrated as high as a 57% insulin-free remission rate that was not sustained&#xD;
      due to the lack of beta cell regeneration (Feutren 1986, Bougneres 1988, Eisenbarth 1989,&#xD;
      Sobel 2010). Studies among diabetes patients with proton pump inhibitors have shown the&#xD;
      potential to increase beta cell mass by 40%, but among type 1 patients without immune&#xD;
      protection, such outcomes cannot be not achieved (Singh 2012, Griffin 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The usage of a beta cell regeneration agent such as omeprazole, in combination with an immune&#xD;
      tolerance, like cyclosporine, provides both the potential ability to maintain and regenerate&#xD;
      beta cells. This is a new paradigm for the treatment of new onset type 1 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More than 60 human trials have been conducted among type 1 diabetes with a variety of&#xD;
      different therapies aimed at preventing autoimmune attack on insulin-producing beta cells.&#xD;
      None have been as effective as cyclosporine in both slowing the decline in beta cell mass and&#xD;
      resulting in the potential for insulin-free remissions. (Canadian-European Randomized Control&#xD;
      Trial 1988, Eisenbarth 1989, Skyler 1992, Sobel 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because cyclosporine is known for its potential side-effects, most notably in the kidney, all&#xD;
      previous studies among type 1 patients have carefully monitored kidney function. Follow-up&#xD;
      studies for up to 13 years among 285 type 1 patients utilizing cyclosporine for 20 months did&#xD;
      not demonstrate renal or other side effects at the dosages that will be used in this trial&#xD;
      (Assan 2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most effective initiating dosage for insulin independence in the cyclosporine trials was&#xD;
      7.5 mg/kg/day, but for safety, this study will begin at a lower dosage of 5 mg/kg/day and&#xD;
      will monitor kidney function and cyclosporine levels initially on a weekly basis. This study&#xD;
      will use only those dosages of cyclosporine that have not demonstrated toxicity to the kidney&#xD;
      or resulted in non-reversible side effects among more than 500 patients with recent onset&#xD;
      type 1 diabetes treated with cyclosporine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Omeprazole has been shown to significantly increase gastrin levels which is associated with&#xD;
      increased beta cells. Lansoprazole has also been shown to be safe among patients with new&#xD;
      onset type 1 diabetes for one year with a trend toward increased beta cell mass among&#xD;
      patients with higher gastrin levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a randomized trial for 12 weeks among 56 patients undergoing pancreatectomy, those&#xD;
      randomized to receive a proton pump inhibitor had significantly increased gastrin levels,&#xD;
      higher insulin levels and improved endocrine function by glucose tolerance testing and less&#xD;
      pancreatic atrophy as measured by CT scans (Jang 2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recently completed REPAIR T1D trial among newly diagnosed type 1 patients used a proton&#xD;
      pump inhibitor and GLP-1 therapies for 1 year for beta regeneration failed to meet its&#xD;
      endpoint of increased stimulated C-peptide. Lack of maintenance or regeneration of beta cells&#xD;
      was specifically noted to have likely been due to lack of usage of immune therapy to protect&#xD;
      beta cells (Griffin 2014, Rigby 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those patients in REPAIR T1D, who did achieve gastrin and GLP-1 levels above those in the&#xD;
      control group had a trend towards improved preservation of C-peptide with a suggestion of a&#xD;
      decreased rate of fall of C-peptide through 12 months (Griffin 2014 Appendix Supplemental&#xD;
      data). Glucose levels also trended lower than controls in the intervention arm with gastrin&#xD;
      levels above the control arm (Griffin 2014 Appendix Supplemental data). In humans, the newly&#xD;
      forming beta cells are under the greatest immune attack among type 1 patients (Meier 2006).&#xD;
      REPAIR T1D underscores the importance for both immune therapy with a regeneration therapy&#xD;
      among type 1 patients (Griffin 2014, Rigby 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of cyclosporine with a proton pump inhibitor has the potential to demonstrate&#xD;
      maintenance and expansion of residual beta cells. This combination therapy provides the&#xD;
      unique ability for patients to become insulin independent.&#xD;
