  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the two surgical options in their short-term and long term outcomes in the&#xD;
      management of early left-sided colorectal cancers. The hypothesis is that the incisionless&#xD;
      approach will result in less postoperative pain and wound related complications.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For the left-sided colorectal cancer, the investigators performed colectomy with primary&#xD;
      anatomosis. Currently the investigators have two methods of minimal access approach to the&#xD;
      abdominal cavity in order to complete this operation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Conventional Laparoscopic colectomy The operation is completed by laparoscopic&#xD;
           instruments using video laparoscopy. At the end of the procedure, pneumoperitoneum is&#xD;
           abolished and a small wound was created for the delivery of bowel and insertion of anvil&#xD;
           of the circular stapler. Finally, pneumoperitoneum is re-created for intra-corporeal&#xD;
           anastomosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Incisionless Laparoscopic Colectomy Laparoscopic colectomy is being performed in the&#xD;
           same manner as conventional laparoscopic colectomy, except that at the end of procedure,&#xD;
           the Transanal Endoscopic Operation (TEO) device with the outer diameter of 4cm is&#xD;
           inserted into the anus for the delivery of specimen and insertion of anvil instead of&#xD;
           creating a small wound as in the conventional laparoscopic colectomy. Finally,&#xD;
           intra-corporeal anastomosis is performed in the same manner with the TEO device removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These two operations are essentially identical except for the surgical access for the&#xD;
      delivery of specimen and insertion of anvil. Laparoscopic colectomy and the use of Transanal&#xD;
      Endoscopic Operation(TEO)device have been practiced in the United States and Europe for over&#xD;
      10 years. Large scale studies in the literature have demonstrated the safety and benefits of&#xD;
      laparoscopic colectomy for colonic tumors and the oncological outcomes have not shown to be&#xD;
      inferior to open approach. With the use of TEO device, the investigators can perform&#xD;
      laparoscopic colectomy without abdominal incision for those early left-sided colonic tumors&#xD;
      and thus it can eliminate the wound-related complications theoretically. In order to find out&#xD;
      which one is a better procedure, the investigators are carrying out a clinical trial to&#xD;
      compare the two surgical options in their short-term and long term outcomes.The results of&#xD;
      this study may have an impact on the care of similar patients in the future.&#xD;
