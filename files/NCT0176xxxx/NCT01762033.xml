    <textblock>
      This Phase 2a study will investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of ASONEP™&#xD;
      (sonepcizumab/LT1009) when administered intravenously once a week, every 4 weeks (or cycle),&#xD;
      to subjects with refractory renal cell carcinoma (RCC) until the disease progresses. Subjects&#xD;
      who have failed 3 prior treatments for RCC including vascular endothelial growth factor&#xD;
      (VEGF) and/or mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors or who have tumors that cannot&#xD;
      be surgically removed will be eligible for screening.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      LT1009-Onc-002 is a Phase 2a open-label, multi-center study designed to evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of ASONEP (sonepcizumab/LT1009) monotherapy in subjects with advanced,&#xD;
      unresectable, refractory RCC who have previously failed up to 3 therapies, including VEGF&#xD;
      and/or mTOR inhibitors. Two cohorts will be enrolled for a total of up to 39 subjects.&#xD;
      Subjects will receive an intravenous (IV) infusion of ASONEP™ over 90 minutes at 24 mg/kg&#xD;
      once a week and progression-free survival (PFS) will be assessed after 8 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
      Cohort 1 will enroll approximately 22 subjects. A second cohort of up to 17 subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled if at least 12 out of 22 subjects from Cohort 1 demonstrated PFS at 8 weeks. Weekly&#xD;
      dosing will take place from the date of randomization until the date of first documented&#xD;
      progression or date of death from any cause, whichever comes first.&#xD;

    <description>The study will use a two-cohort design based on an 8-week PFS rate. Treatment will be considered promising if at least 12 out of the first 22 eligible subjects entered in the Cohort 1 of the study are progression free at Week 8. Enrollment of Cohort 2 will then proceed and be considered worthy of further evaluation if at least 25 out of 39 eligible subjects are progression free at Week 8. If no efficacy signal is observed after enrollment of 22 subjects in Cohort 1, the second cohort will not be enrolled and the clinical study may be stopped.</description>
