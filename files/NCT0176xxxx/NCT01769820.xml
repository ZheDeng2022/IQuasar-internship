    <textblock>
      This study builds on previous research which has provided compelling evidence that deficient&#xD;
      activity of glucocorticoids in the endometrium is a cause of increased menstrual bleeding.&#xD;
      This study aims to demonstrate that a glucocorticoid (dexamethasone), already in common use&#xD;
      for other conditions, (eg to treat medical conditions such as asthma and rheumatoid arthritis&#xD;
      in early pregnancy), will reverse the endometrial glucocorticoid deficiency and as a result&#xD;
      reduce menstrual blood loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is in two stages, a 12 month workup stage and a 3 year, response adaptive,&#xD;
      dose-finding randomised controlled trial. The first stage involves two workup clinical&#xD;
      studies to gather preliminary safety and efficacy data from first-in-Heavy Menstrual Bleeding&#xD;
      use of oral dexamethasone. They will also provide methodological data for a series of&#xD;
      simulation studies to determine a robust adaptive trial design specification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Workup study 1: is unblinded, six patients will be given Dexamethasone (0.75mg twice daily)&#xD;
      for 5 days during two consecutive menstrual cycles and will have an endometrial biopsy and&#xD;
      MRI on two occasions (in a nontreated cycle, and the second of the cycles treated with&#xD;
      Dexamethasone). Workup study 2; is a doubleblind crossover trial of 14 women -2 treatment&#xD;
      blocks of two cycles each, with either placebo or Dexamethasone (0.75mg twice daily),&#xD;
      randomised to order of treatments blocks - placebo then Dexamethasone, or vice-versa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adaptive trial: 54 month double-blind, placebo controlled trial of 108 women to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of Dexamethasone across a range of doses with the aim of identifying the optimal dose&#xD;
      to be studied in a subsequent Phase III trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomised to receive one of 6 active doses or placebo over 3 menstrual&#xD;
      cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All studies will involve asking participants to complete menstrual diaries and to carry out&#xD;
      menstrual blood loss collections to objectively measure blood loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' proposed approach is novel use of synthetic glucocorticoid to &quot;rescue&quot;&#xD;
      luteal phase deficiency of cortisol, and thus improve endometrial vasculature and hence&#xD;
      vasoconstriction when menses commences, and thus reduce menstrual bleeding.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background Menstrual bleeding complaints affect quality of life and comprise a substantial&#xD;
      societal burden, including major impact on health care use and costs. Current medical therapy&#xD;
      for heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is often ineffective and/or associated with unacceptable&#xD;
      side effects. There is unmet clinical need for targeted, effective, medical treatment&#xD;
      strategies for HMB. The investigators' findings from research into mechanisms in HMB has led&#xD;
      to the conclusion that women with HMB have enhanced endometrial inactivation of cortisol by&#xD;
      11βHSD2 resulting in local endometrial glucocorticoid deficiency, changes in prostaglandin&#xD;
      (PG) production, and altered structure and deficient vasoconstriction of the endometrial&#xD;
      vasculature. The investigators therefore anticipate that luteal phase &quot;rescue&quot; of endometrial&#xD;
      glucocorticoid deficiency will provide a novel approach to therapy for women with HMB. The&#xD;
      synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone (Dex) is a potent cortisol surrogate and&#xD;
      glucocorticoid receptor (GR) agonist that resists 11βHSD2 inactivation. In a non-human&#xD;
      primate study the investigators have observed a striking reduction in menstrual blood loss&#xD;
      after Dexamethasone administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives The investigators aim to show proof-of-concept that Dexamethasone administration&#xD;
      in women with HMB will improve the capacity of endometrial vasculature for efficient&#xD;
      vasoconstriction when menses commences, and hence reduce menstrual bleeding. The&#xD;
      investigators' proposal is a novel use of an existing, well-characterised medical treatment&#xD;
      (Dex).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods The Investigators propose a parallel group randomised controlled trial in women with&#xD;
      HMB comparing Dexamethasone (over a range of potential doses) to placebo treatment. The trial&#xD;
      design will be response-adaptive, whereby randomisation probabilities change across time to&#xD;
      ensure that maximum information is obtained in the critical region of the underlying&#xD;
      dose-response curve (that containing the 'optimum' dose). This has the added advantage that&#xD;
      relatively more and more women are randomised to the doses emerging as most effective. Such a&#xD;
      design is the most parsimonious way to enable both robust demonstration of the therapeutic&#xD;
      effect of Dexamethasone on HMB, and reliable identification of the optimal dose to take&#xD;
      forward for future further study in a Phase III trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work Up Stage Adaptive designs such as this require a work up stage to enable the simulation&#xD;
      modelling necessary to determine a robust final design specification with adequate power&#xD;
      (here, the expected number of patients required lies in the range 100-108). In addition this&#xD;
      work up stage will allow two clinical studies to be executed. Data collected in these will&#xD;
      inform the modelling and simulation, but will also enhance mechanistic and pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      understanding of observed Dexamethasone effect, and will be an invaluable preliminary check&#xD;
      of safety of this 'first-in-HMB' use of oral Dexamethasone. These studies will involve&#xD;
      treating in total 20 women with HMB with two cycles of Dexamethasone (1.5mg daily).&#xD;
