  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK2269557 is potent and highly selective inhaled phosphoinositides 3-kinases -delta&#xD;
      (PI3K-delta) inhibitor being developed as an anti-inflammatory agent for the treatment of&#xD;
      inflammatory airway diseases. GSK2269557 has already been administered as a nebulized&#xD;
      solution in single and repeat doses to humans and has been well tolerated across the range of&#xD;
      doses used. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of single and repeat inhaled doses of GSK2269557 as a dry powder. This study&#xD;
      is the first administration of dry powder GSK2269557 in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A will consist of four treatment periods separated by at least 14 days wash out periods.&#xD;
      In each treatment period there will be 12 subjects receiving GSK2269557 and 4 subjects&#xD;
      receiving placebo. The doses of GSK2269557 planned for Part A are 100 micrograms (mcg), 500&#xD;
      mcg and 3000 mcg. Blinded safety and available pharmacokinetic (PK) data will be reviewed&#xD;
      before each dose escalation. Part B will be a parallel group design conducted in a separate&#xD;
      group of subjects from Part A. Nine subjects will receive repeat doses of GSK2269557 and 3&#xD;
      subjects will receive repeat doses of placebo for 14 days. The total daily dose will be the&#xD;
      same as the dose that was well tolerated in Part A. The study duration, including screening&#xD;
      and follow-up, is not expected to exceed 82 days for subjects in part A and 55 days for&#xD;
      subjects in part B of the study.&#xD;
