  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical wound infections remain a serious problem despite aseptic techniques and the use of&#xD;
      prophylactic systemic antibiotics. Such infections can occur at rates up to ~20% in high-risk&#xD;
      patients receiving long segment instrumented spinal fusions for deformity correction and&#xD;
      present potentially catastrophic consequences. Given this, the high cost of treatment, and a&#xD;
      payer system unable to support such expenses, investigators must make every effort to find&#xD;
      new cost-effective ways to prevent these complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increasingly surgeons have sought to address this problem by placing lyophilized Vancomycin&#xD;
      into spinal surgery wounds immediately prior to wound closure. This method, known as&#xD;
      &quot;intrasite&quot; application, is adapted from techniques used to prevent infection in joint&#xD;
      replacement surgeries. The motivation for this practice is to maximize antibiotic&#xD;
      concentration within the wound while minimizing systemic concentration and toxicity, (the&#xD;
      inverse of the situation when using IV antibiotics). While the popularity of intrasite&#xD;
      delivery has grown rapidly, this has occurred without prospective scientific evidence.&#xD;
      Recently, three retrospective papers including nearly 2,500 treated patients, indicated that&#xD;
      intrasite Vancomycin reduces wound infections without increasing adverse events[1-3].&#xD;
      However, there are no published data on the dosing or pharmacokinetics of intrasite&#xD;
      Vancomycin, let alone prospective trials of its efficacy and safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to perform the first prospective trial of intrasite Vancomycin&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and safety. Study objectives will include standardizing application and&#xD;
      dosing, defining peak/trough concentrations and clearance parameters, verifying bactericidal&#xD;
      potency, and dose selection for use in future studies. This will be accomplished by enrolling&#xD;
      groups of patients (n=10) to receive one of three doses of intrasite lyophilized Vancomycin&#xD;
      (3, 6 or 12 mg/cm2), prior to wound closure. Vancomycin concentrations in venous blood and&#xD;
      wound seroma fluid will be measured at regular intervals after surgery to establish&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic parameters. Preliminary data regarding local and systemic adverse events&#xD;
      including wound healing, fusion rate, and toxicity will be prospectively collected. The&#xD;
      ultimate goal of this learning-phase study is to gather sufficient information regarding&#xD;
      application, dosing, pharmacokinetics, measurement strategies, and adverse events to prepare&#xD;
      for a Phase III efficacy trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite extremely close attention to aseptic technique and the use of prophylactic IV&#xD;
      antibiotics, wound infection rates for posterior instrumented spinal surgery have been as&#xD;
      high as ~20% in published studies[4-13]. Such infections can be devastating for patients,&#xD;
      frequently requiring multiple re-operations to remove and then replace spinal implants,&#xD;
      lengthy hospital stays, prolonged courses of intravenous antibiotics, pain, immobility, and&#xD;
      increased risk of other complications. While the cost of the initial surgical episode can be&#xD;
      upwards of $250,000, the total cost of care can increase to more than quadruple this number&#xD;
      when complications like wound infection occur[14, 15]. Given the impetus to decrease&#xD;
      healthcare costs and a federal reimbursement policy denying payment for any care surrounding&#xD;
      a wound infection, it is critical to search for cost-effective ways of preventing surgical&#xD;
      wound infections[14, 16].&#xD;
&#xD;
      For several decades the standard of care in North America for surgical wound infection&#xD;
      prophylaxis has been IV cephalosporin administration within one hour of incision, followed by&#xD;
      interval IV dosing for 24 to 48hrs post-procedure[5, 13]. In some settings these antibiotics&#xD;
      now effectively treat less than half of identified infection-causing organisms[17, 18]. In&#xD;
      response, some groups of surgeons, including at the investigators' own institution, have&#xD;
      begun placing lyophilized Vancomycin into the surgical wound bed at the conclusion of the&#xD;
      procedure in an effort to further reduce wound infection rates[1-3]. The rationale behind&#xD;
      this intrasite antibiotic application is to increase local concentrations of antibiotic to&#xD;
      many times the minimally inhibitory concentration (MIC) for even moderately-resistant&#xD;
      gram-positive organisms, thereby increasing the bacterial kill rate[3]. It is also thought&#xD;
      that local antibiotic application should minimize blood concentrations of the drug, thereby&#xD;
      minimizing systemic complications like renal toxicity. Additionally, it is hypothesized that&#xD;
      intrasite antibiotic therapy could be less inclined to generate resistant organisms due to a&#xD;
      steep concentration gradient from the wound to the systemic circulation. The site of&#xD;
      potential infection (the wound) receives a dose of antibiotic vastly exceeding the saturation&#xD;
      concentration for bactericidal effect while the systemic concentration remains extremely low.&#xD;
      Bacteria should therefore be completely exterminated in the area of the wound or elsewhere&#xD;
      exposed to such a minimal concentration of Vancomycin that selection for resistant organisms&#xD;
      is avoided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While none of these hypotheses have been rigorously or prospectively tested, three&#xD;
      retrospective studies have recently published a total of 2,479 spinal fusion patients treated&#xD;
      with intrasite Vancomycin for wound infection prophylaxis[1-3]. The largest of these studies&#xD;
      demonstrated a 0.99% infection rate in the treatment group, among the lowest rates ever&#xD;
      published[1]. Two of the studies showed large and statistically significant decreases in the&#xD;
      wound infection rate, compared to historical controls, when using intrasite Vancomycin in&#xD;
      addition to standard of care IV cephalosporins. Preliminary evidence in one study also&#xD;
      indicated high levels of Vancomycin within the wound and low or undetectable levels within&#xD;
      the blood following surgery[3]. All of these studies specifically cited that no adverse&#xD;
      events had been observed related to the treatment[1-3].&#xD;
&#xD;
      If intrasite Vancomycin proves to be safe and effective for preventing spinal fusion surgical&#xD;
      site infections, the treatment will offer great clinical value both for reducing morbidity&#xD;
      and also for decreasing large unsupported costs. A future large prospective efficacy trial&#xD;
      would be required to provide high-level evidence for this new mode of antibiotic therapy in&#xD;
      order to justify wide-spread adoption of the practice in spine surgery. Such data in any&#xD;
      population might also be generalizable to surgical wounds at large and prompt a paradigm&#xD;
      shift in infection prophylaxis for all types of surgical wounds. The proposed study addresses&#xD;
      necessary prerequisites for such a large-scale efficacy trial, including basic&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic and preliminary prospective safety data.&#xD;
