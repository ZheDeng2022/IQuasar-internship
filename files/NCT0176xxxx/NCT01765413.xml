  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is thought that vaccines trigger innate inflammatory responses to induce antigenspecific&#xD;
      adaptive immunity (the desired effect), but excessive inflammation may lead to serious&#xD;
      inflammatory complications or unwanted side effects. Currently there is a lack of reliable&#xD;
      biomarkers (a measurable biological response that predicts something) able to predict severe&#xD;
      inflammation and this has resulted in the development of several vaccines being terminated&#xD;
      and the withdrawal of some licensed vaccines which were associated with inflammatory&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is part of the BIOVACSAFE project which is a 5year €30M project funded by the&#xD;
      Innovative Medicine Initiative. The project involves a series of clinical studies using&#xD;
      licensed vaccines as benchmarks to generate clinical data on inflammation and identify&#xD;
      biomarkers that can be used to predict acceptable reactogenicity. The target is to identify&#xD;
      biomarkers that can predict the occurrence of beneficial and detrimental effects in response&#xD;
      to a vaccine. Such biomarkers could be used in future vaccine development programs to&#xD;
      optimize selection of vaccine candidates with a profile that will be unlikely to generate&#xD;
      worrisome safety signals once they are in generalized use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is one in a series of &quot;training&quot; studies which will each use different licensed&#xD;
      vaccines that are prototypical representatives of a class of vaccine used in a particular&#xD;
      target population. Forty eight subjects will be randomised into three groups to receive: A)&#xD;
      Varicella zoster vaccine (n = 20), B) Yellow Fever vaccine (n = 20), C) Saline placebo (n =&#xD;
      8). Following a screening visit, participants will undergo a seven day residential visit&#xD;
      which will include immunization and intensive monitoring of physiological (e.g. heart rate,&#xD;
      oral temperature, blood pressure) metabolic and immune (innate and adaptive) parameters. This&#xD;
      visit will be followed up by four outpatient visits with further monitoring and blood&#xD;
      samples.&#xD;
