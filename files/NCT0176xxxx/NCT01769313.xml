    <textblock>
      This clinical study (non AMG/non MPG) is a contralateral, comparative, randomized,&#xD;
      prospective, single-center, multi-surgeon, investigator masked study to investigate whether&#xD;
      the femtolaser cataract surgery causes any significant differences in the resulting Intra&#xD;
      Ocular Lens overlap (ΔROverlap) as compared to the conventional, manual continuous&#xD;
      curvilinear capsulorhexis (CCC). The Intra Ocular Lens overlap (ΔROverlap) is defined as the&#xD;
      difference between the Intra Ocular Lens center of mass to the capsulotomy aperture center of&#xD;
      mass.&#xD;

      A detailed pre-operative examination will ensure that every interested and willing patient&#xD;
      fulfills the inclusion criteria of this study. For the proposed contralateral eye study&#xD;
      between 30 and 35 patients will be enrolled whereas one eye will randomized undergo a manual&#xD;
      cataract surgery and the other one a laser assisted cataract surgery. In total between 60 and&#xD;
      70 eyes will be included in the study. Pre-operative examinations are included to confirm to&#xD;
      the clinical practice. Examinations on the day of surgery and any occurrence during the&#xD;
      procedure are also listed. Post-operative examinations, which should document any occurrence,&#xD;
      the outcome of and possible differences between the treatment techniques, are to be carried&#xD;
      out after 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months. After 6 month a final report&#xD;
      including the study results will be produced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is carried out in compliance with MEDDEV 2.7.1 Evaluation of Clinical Data: A Guide&#xD;
      for Manufacturers and Notified Bodies, ICH E6 (R1) Good Clinical Practice (GCP), Declaration&#xD;
      of Helsinki as well as the applicable local regulations such as notification requirements and&#xD;
      current order of profession of the primary investigators.&#xD;
