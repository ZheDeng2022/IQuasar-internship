      The purpose of this research is to compare the effects of two commonly used, safe, thoracic&#xD;
      spine grade 1-4 and grade 5 mobilization to the thoracic spine on cervical spine pain in&#xD;
      individuals with nontraumatic cervical pain. The immediate effects of thoracic spine&#xD;
      mobilization have been shown to facilitate greater range of motion increases in the cervical&#xD;
      spine and greater pain decreases within a treatment session and on follow-up visits. There is&#xD;
      no research utilizing pain threshold perception as an objective outcome of these treatments.&#xD;
      Only one study compared the two treatment techniques and concluded that future research&#xD;
      should be completed which includes manual therapy for the thoracic spine. (Cleland 2007)&#xD;

      The purpose of this research is to compare the effects of two commonly used, safe, thoracic&#xD;
      spine grade 1-4 and grade 5 mobilization to the thoracic spine on cervical spine pain in&#xD;
      individuals with nontraumatic cervical pain. The immediate effects of thoracic spine&#xD;
      mobilization have been shown to facilitate greater range of motion increases in the cervical&#xD;
      spine and greater pain decreases within a treatment session and on follow-up visits. There is&#xD;
      no research utilizing pain threshold perception as an objective outcome of these treatments.&#xD;
      Only one study compared the two treatment techniques and concluded that future research&#xD;
      should be completed which includes manual therapy for the thoracic spine. (Cleland 2007)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be patients at clinics owned by Physiotherapy Associates, Fit Physical&#xD;
      Therapy, and Allegheny and Chesapeake PT who seek physical therapy services for nontraumatic&#xD;
      neck pain. Participation will be entirely voluntary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be offered a chance to participate in the research project on their initial&#xD;
      visit for Physical Therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the PT identifies an appropriate patient they will ask if they are interested in being a&#xD;
      research subject. The Physical Therapist recruiting subjects all have completed their Doctor&#xD;
      of Physical Therapy Degree and have advanced training in manual Physical Therapy. The&#xD;
      techniques employed are considered standard practice and are defined as entry level skills by&#xD;
      the Commission of Accredidation of Physical Therapy Programs. These techniques are typically&#xD;
      taught in DPT degree programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient is interested, a description of the study will be provided. A consent form&#xD;
      will be given to all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients who present to one of three Physical Therapy clinics, under the direction of&#xD;
           three advanced clinicians, will be assessed for their potential participation in this&#xD;
           research. The treating clinician will recruit appropriate subjects based on includion&#xD;
           and exclusion criteria and their PT diagnosis. Those that meet the inclusion and&#xD;
           exclusion criteria will be given the consent form to determine if they wish to&#xD;
           participate. Each researcher will have formal training in these techniques. Two of the&#xD;
           clinicians have received their Orthopedic Clinical Specialists certification under the&#xD;
           examination prcess outlined by the American Physical Therapy association. A third&#xD;
           researcher has obtained his fellowship designation from the American Academy of&#xD;
           Orthopedic Manual Physical Therapy. This skill is deemed entry level by the the&#xD;
           Accredidation Board of the American Physical Therapy Educators. All Therapists will&#xD;
           undergo a prestudy hands on education program to ensure the use of similar techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. If after reading the consent form they agree to participate, they will be given one&#xD;
           additional form, the Pain Catastrophizing scale, and asked to complete it. The scale,&#xD;
           NDI, cervical ROM, age, and birthdate will be recorded on a sheet contained in the&#xD;
           patient's clinical chart.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The PT evaluation will then be completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. They will then be randomized into one of two groups based on a roll of a die:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Group One: Mobilization Group: this group will receive grade 1,2,3,or 4 mobilization in&#xD;
           prone based on the PT's clinical judgement.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The treatment parameters will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Group Two: Grade 5 mobilization group: this group wil receive a grade 5 mobilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Additional treatment including patient eduation, modalities, and exercise will be&#xD;
           completed as the PT deems appropriate,&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The second visit will be scheduled within 24 to 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. The patient will complete the same forms as were completed during the initial evaluation&#xD;
           (NDI, PCS) and return them so that the results may berecorded on the record sheet&#xD;
           identified only with date of birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. The treatment will be repeated including the manual technique and other treatment deemed&#xD;
           appropriate by the PT. Additional treatment between the second and last visits will be&#xD;
           under the sole discretion on the treating PT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. On the discharge visit, the patient will receive the same forms, and be asked how much,&#xD;
           in terms of %, they feel they have improved. This information will be recorded on the&#xD;
           deidentified sheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Home exercise programs and patient educaiton will be issued as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A bubble goniometer will be used for range of motion assessment. This is a standard plastic&#xD;
      device used in PT practice. A Wagner FDX digital force gauge algometer will measure pain&#xD;
      pressure thresholds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Where survey instruments are involved, a copy of the instrument and, for surveys not created&#xD;
      for this project, assurance that the principal investigator has proper approval to use them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Neck Disability Index or NDI will be used. It is the professional standard for outcomes&#xD;
      measures for people with neck pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been shown to be valid and reliable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Pain Castrophizing Scale will be used. It is a valid and reliable measure of a patient's&#xD;
      perception of pain and is commonly used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be collected by the treating Physical Therapist who has access to the patient&#xD;
      record for treatment purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will not be used for purposes other that patient care and research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient's data measures will be collected on a de-identified sheet marked with the patients&#xD;
      birthday. The will be kept in a locked area in the clinic. The lead investigator will have&#xD;
      access to the data when the study is completed and transfer it to a locked file cabinet in&#xD;
      his office for data assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following treatment the patient may have mild soreness over the area which was treated. This&#xD;
      typically diminishes in 24 hours. the patient will be informed of this potential soreness.&#xD;
      The use of heat and /or ice, exercise, and patient education provided by the Therapist&#xD;
      concerning activities and posture will also lessen the soreness.&#xD;
