      The purpose of this research study is to compare the effects (good and bad) on women and&#xD;
      their cancer using proton radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is being done to see if proton radiation therapy will prove to be beneficial for&#xD;
      women with early stage breast cancer. A clinical study is necessary to compare the results&#xD;
      (good or bad) of proton radiation therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current standard of care for early stage breast cancer is mastectomy or breast conserving&#xD;
      therapy with whole breast irradiation following lumpectomy. However, studies of breast cancer&#xD;
      recurrence have demonstrated the majority of tumors to recur in or adjacent to the original&#xD;
      tumor site. The question has thus been raised as to whether radiation to the whole breast is&#xD;
      necessary or justified. Limiting radiation to the area of the original tumor may reduce acute&#xD;
      and long-term skin and organ toxicities while making radiation therapy more convenient and&#xD;
      less expensive. Several clinical trials are underway comparing partial breast irradiation&#xD;
      (PBI) to whole breast irradiation. Numerous centers are offering partial breast irradiation&#xD;
      outside of clinical trials as well, despite the lack of long-term safety and efficacy data on&#xD;
      PBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Available PBI methods include brachytherapy, in which catheters or balloons are surgically&#xD;
      inserted to deliver radiation therapy to the lumpectomy cavity, and conventional external&#xD;
      beam radiation therapy, or EBRT. External beam photon therapy is attractive for its&#xD;
      non-invasive nature and ability to deliver a more homogenous dose distribution compared to&#xD;
      brachytherapy, however it also delivers a greater radiation dose to surrounding normal breast&#xD;
      tissue.Proton therapy has the capacity to provide the same advantages as photon EBRT while&#xD;
      minimizing dose to normal surrounding tissue. Clinical data on PBI with protons is minimal,&#xD;
      however, leaving many questions unanswered. The impetus behind this protocol is to address&#xD;
      these gaps by further investigating the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of proton therapy&#xD;
      for partial breast irradiation.&#xD;

    <description>Freedom from failure (FFF): The events for FFF will be the first ipsilateral breast cancer recurrence. It is expected that less than 3% of patients will experience an ipsilateral breast cancer recurrence (FFF ≥ 97%). A recurrence rate of ≥ 10% (FFF ≤ 90%) is considered unacceptable. Therefore, the null hypothesis is the FFF of ipsilateral breast cancer recurrence is 90% or lower and the alternative hypothesis is that FFF of ipsilateral breast cancer is 97% or higher.</description>
