  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of pressure controlled ventilation (TV) during one lung ventilation (OLV) for&#xD;
      thoracic surgery is associated with comparable oxygenation with volume controlled ventilation&#xD;
      (VCV) with added benefits of decreasing airway pressures and shunt fraction. The later may&#xD;
      improve the right ventricular (RV) function during OLV. We postulate that the use of PCV&#xD;
      during OLV for thoracic surgery would preserve RV function than during VCV. After local&#xD;
      ethics committee approval and informed consent, we will randomly allocate 28 patients&#xD;
      scheduled for elective thoracic surgery OLV to randomly crossed from PCV to VCV mode (n= 14&#xD;
      for each) during with VT of 6 mL/kg, I: E ratio 1: 2.5, PEEP of 5 cm H2O, recruitment&#xD;
      maneuvers and respiratory rate will be adjusted to maintain normocapnia. Intraoperative&#xD;
      changes in the right ventricular function (peak systolic and diastolic tricuspid annular&#xD;
      velocity (TAV), end-diastolic volume (EDV), end-systolic volume (ESV), and RV fractional area&#xD;
      changes (RV-FAC)), hemodynamic and oxygenation parameters, peak and plateau airway pressures,&#xD;
      compliance will be recorded.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One-lung ventilation (OLV) provides excellent operative field for thoracic procedures, but is&#xD;
      opposed by the harmful impairment of cardiac index and right ventricular (RV) function which&#xD;
      may influence postoperative morbidity and mortality. In our previous study, we demonstrated&#xD;
      significant reductions in RV ejection fraction (REF) and CI values after the initiation of&#xD;
      OLV attributable to the increased right ventricular afterload, stroke work and end-diastolic&#xD;
      volume augmented by increased airway pressures. This may be harmful with the patients with&#xD;
      advanced obstructive lung diseases and those with pulmonary hypertension. Thus there is no&#xD;
      doubt that decreases in airway pressures will be associated with better RV function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volume controlled ventilation (VCV) is the commonly used traditional ventilation mode for OLV&#xD;
      during thoracic procedures but its use is associated with deleterious increases in airway&#xD;
      pressure which may impede RV function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pressure controlled ventilation (PCV) is an alternative mode of ventilation which is widely&#xD;
      used in the patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute lung injury&#xD;
      (ALI), whereby high initial flow rates are delivered to quickly achieve and maintain the set&#xD;
      inspiratory pressure followed by rapidly decelerating flow.These high initial flow rates lead&#xD;
      to a more rapid alveolar inflation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PCV has been suggested as a useful tool to improve oxygenation as well as decreases in&#xD;
      intra-pulmonary shunt (Qs/Qt) and airway pressures compared with VCV during OLV for patients&#xD;
      undergoing thoracic surgery. Whereas, others demonstrated comparable arterial oxygenation&#xD;
      with the use of PCV and VCV during OLV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the use of PCV offers advantages over VCV during OLV in the term of reducing mean&#xD;
      and bronchial peak airway pressures and intrapulmonary shunt, hence limiting the risk for&#xD;
      barotrauma and impaired RV function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to the investigators knowledge, there is no available study of the effects of PCV and VCV&#xD;
      on RV function during OLV after thoracic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the use of PCV during OLV will be associated with&#xD;
      preserved RV function than during the use of VCV. They will compare the effects of the use of&#xD;
      PCV and VCV with 5 cm H2O level of PEEP and recruitment maneuvers during OLV on the right&#xD;
      ventricular function (peak systolic and diastolic tricuspid annular velocity (TAV),&#xD;
      end-diastolic volume (EDV), end-systolic volume (ESV), and RV fractional area changes&#xD;
      (RV-FAC)), hemodynamic parameters (heart rate (HR), mean arterial blood pressure, (MAP)),&#xD;
      oxygenation parameters (arterial oxygen and carbon dioxide tension (PaO2 and PaCO2,&#xD;
      respectively), and arterial tension to inspired fraction of oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) ratio),&#xD;
      ventilation parameters (peak and plateau airway pressures (Ppk and Ppl, respectively) and&#xD;
      compliance) and the ICU and hospital length-of-stays, morbidity and 30-day mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A priori power analysis of the previous published data11 showed that the investigators will&#xD;
      need to study 13 pairs to detect a 20% difference in the mean maximal systolic TAV values&#xD;
      (7.0 cm/s) with a SD of 1.4 cm/s, after start of OLV, a type-I error of 0.05 and a power of&#xD;
      90%. We will add 10% more patients for a final sample size of 28 patients to account for&#xD;
      patients dropping out during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all patients, standard monitors will be applied. A thoracic epidural or paravertebral&#xD;
      catheter will be inserted with no more use of local anesthetics during the study to avoid&#xD;
      their effects on hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction.12 An arterial line (20 G) and a right&#xD;
      internal jugular vein catheter will be inserted. Anesthetic technique will be standardized in&#xD;
      all studied patients. Anesthesiologists who will give the anaesthetic will be not involved in&#xD;
      the patient's assessment. General anesthesia will be induced with propofol (2-3 mg/kg),&#xD;
      fentanyl (2-3 µg/kg), and cisatracurium (0.2 mg/kg) will be given to facilitate tracheal&#xD;
      intubation with a left-sided double-lumen tube (DLT). The correct position of its tip will be&#xD;
      confirmed with a fiberoptic bronchoscope. Anesthesia will be maintained with 1-1.5 minimum&#xD;
      alveolar concentration (MAC) of sevoflurane and increments of fentanyl (0.5µg/kg) and&#xD;
      cisatracurium (0.04 mg/kg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients' lungs will be mechanically ventilated using VCV mode, fraction of inspired&#xD;
      oxygen (FiO2) of 0.5 in air, tidal volume (VT) of 8 mL/kg (predicted body weight),&#xD;
      inspiratory to expiratory [I: E] ratio of 1:2.5, a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of&#xD;
      5 cm H2O, respiratory rate (R.R) will be adjusted to achieve an PaCO2 of 35-45 mm Hg, peak&#xD;
      inspiratory pressures (Ppk) will be limited to 35 cm H2O and a low fresh gas flow (FGF) (&lt;2&#xD;
      L/min) in a semi closed circuit system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) will be inserted and the right ventricular function&#xD;
      will be assessed with the measurements of EDV, ESV, RVEF, both maximal systolic and diastolic&#xD;
      TAV at the tricuspid annulus at the RV free wall recorded from the apical 4-chamber views&#xD;
      using pulsed wave Doppler tissue imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All operations will be performed by the same surgeons. Intraoperative hypoxemia will be&#xD;
      defined as decrease in arterial oxygen saturation less than 90% will be treated with&#xD;
      increasing of FiO2 to 1.0. Addition of low level of 2 cm H2O of CPAP will be considered if&#xD;
      the later fails to correct hypoxemia. 1 Intraoperative fluid therapy will include intravenous&#xD;
      infusion of 2 ml/kg/hour of Lactated Ringer's solution and blood losses will be compensated&#xD;
      with colloids and with red blood cell concentrates if the hemoglobin levels decreases below 8&#xD;
      to 9 g/dL. Mean arterial blood pressure will be maintained greater than 60 mm Hg using bolus&#xD;
      doses of ephedrine 5 mg or phenylephrine 100 ug. Urine output will be maintained to be&#xD;
      greater than 0.5 ml/kg/hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of surgery, the nondependent will be re-expanded and TLV will be resumed as before&#xD;
      surgery, sevoflurane will be discontinued, the residual neuromuscular block will be&#xD;
      antagonized, and the patient will be extubated. Postoperative analgesia will be accomplished&#xD;
      with the use of continuous epidural/paravertebral infusion of bupivacaine 0.125% and fentanyl&#xD;
      2 µg/mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be tested for normality using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Fisher exact test will&#xD;
      be used for categorical data. Repeated two-way ANOVA and paired t-test will be used to study&#xD;
      the changes in the primary and secondary endpoints during each intervention. The Wilcoxon 2&#xD;
      rank sum test will be used for the non-parametric values. We will avoid the carryover effect&#xD;
      (persistence of the effect of the first intervention on the operative conditions into the&#xD;
      second period) through the comparison of the effects of period (time effect) and the order of&#xD;
      treatment using independent t-tests. Data will be expressed as mean ± SD, number (%), or&#xD;
      median [range]. A value of P &lt; 0.05 will be considered to be statistically significant.&#xD;
