    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this proposal is to better understand the basis of structural airway&#xD;
      changes in severe asthma and how asthma exacerbations may contribute to their progression&#xD;
      over time. The investigators propose to study a well-characterized cohort of adult and&#xD;
      pediatric subjects with asthma using a multidisciplinary state-of-the-art approach. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that severe asthma exacerbations, in some patients, are associated with&#xD;
      incomplete recovery and activation of airway inflammatory cells in a regional distribution.&#xD;
      The end result is a more permanent and less reversible airway obstruction that is a prominent&#xD;
      feature of severe asthma.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We have shown that patients with severe asthma have heterogeneous regional ventilation&#xD;
      defects and air trapping. Some of these defects are persistent, while others can be provoked&#xD;
      with virus-induced exacerbations or bronchial challenge and recur in the same general areas&#xD;
      on repeated challenge, suggesting localized airway dysfunction. In preliminary studies,&#xD;
      inflammatory parameters tended to be more prominent in segments that showed ventilation&#xD;
      defects on imaging. Therefore, we hypothesize that asthma exacerbations, in some patients,&#xD;
      are associated with incomplete recovery and activation of airway inflammatory cells in a&#xD;
      regional distribution. This leads to enhanced airway injury with airway dysfunction as&#xD;
      reflected by ventilation defects and air trapping, and a more generalized increase in disease&#xD;
      severity. To evaluate this hypothesis we propose the following specific aims: 1. To refine&#xD;
      phenotyping of severe asthma using new variables from multiple domains in a large&#xD;
      longitudinal patient cohort; and to determine the contribution of asthma exacerbations to&#xD;
      disease progression. 2. To characterize regional obstructive patterns at baseline and their&#xD;
      relationship to changes in pulmonary function; and to determine how incremental changes in&#xD;
      regional airway dysfunction after asthma exacerbations may contribute to severe asthma. 3. To&#xD;
      determine the contribution of established and novel biomarkers (YKL-40, vWF, &amp; P-selectin),&#xD;
      in refining the severe asthma phenotypes and the role of inflammatory cells in causing airway&#xD;
      injury following virus-induced asthma exacerbations with subsequent development of&#xD;
      ventilation defects.&#xD;
