      Epiphora, or uncontrolled tearing of the eyes, represents a common presenting complaint of&#xD;
      patients seen by ophthalmologists. Epiphora may be due to non-obstructive causes, such as&#xD;
      tear hypersecretion or functional tear pump failure, or obstructive causes. Functional tear&#xD;
      pump failure may result from malposition of the eyelids, such as an abnormal out-turning&#xD;
      (ectropion) or in-turning (entropion) of the eyelid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently methods to diagnose partial nasolacrimal duct obstruction are purely qualitative in&#xD;
      nature. Our research goal is to quantitatively measure the pressure generated during&#xD;
      conventional probing and irrigation (P&amp;I), and to measure the resistance to irrigation of the&#xD;
      nasolacrimal drainage system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will measure the pressure generated during conventional P&amp;I using a&#xD;
      disposable in-line pressure transducer. In addition, the investigators will use a syringe&#xD;
      pump to deliver a constant flow rate of saline through a nasolacrimal cannula and measure the&#xD;
      steady state irrigation pressure using the in-line transducer and digital pressure monitor.&#xD;
      Resistance can be directly calculated from the known flow rate and pressure measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will compare both the pressure generated during P&amp;I and the lacrimal&#xD;
      drainage resistance between patients with lacrimal drainage obstruction and controls patients&#xD;
      with no obstruction (functional tear pump failure) as determined by clinical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical applications for measuring lacrimal drainage resistance include quantifying partial&#xD;
      nasolacrimal duct obstruction, guiding the choice of surgical procedure, and determining the&#xD;
      success of lacrimal drainage procedures.&#xD;

      Lacrimal Drainage Resistance&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposal describes our plan to study the resistance of the lacrimal drainage system&#xD;
      during irrigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Research Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To quantitatively measure the resistance of the lacrimal drainage system during&#xD;
           irrigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine differences in lacrimal drainage resistance between patients with&#xD;
           obstructed tear drainage systems and patients with functional tear pump failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To measure the pressure generated during traditional probing and irrigation of the&#xD;
           lacrimal drainage system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Background and Significance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epiphora, or uncontrolled tearing of the eyes, represents a common presenting complaint of&#xD;
      patients seen by ophthalmologists. Epiphora may be due to non-obstructive causes, such as&#xD;
      tear hypersecretion or functional tear pump failure, or obstructive causes. Functional tear&#xD;
      pump failure may result from malposition of the eyelids, such as an abnormal out-turning&#xD;
      (ectropion) or in-turning (entropion) of the eyelid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tears normally drain from the eye through two small holes, called puncta, one located in the&#xD;
      upper eyelid and one in the lower eyelid, and then through two channels, called canaliculi,&#xD;
      that empty into the lacrimal sac. Tears drain from the lacrimal sac through the bony&#xD;
      nasolacrimal duct into the nasal cavity. Obstruction may occur at any level of the system,&#xD;
      and may be partial or complete.[1] The focus of this study is acquired (as opposed to&#xD;
      congenital), nasolacrimal duct obstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The normal work-up for evaluation of nasolacrimal duct obstruction includes multiple clinical&#xD;
      tests to evaluate the patency of the drainage system, including the fluorescein dye&#xD;
      disappearance test, primary and secondary Jones dye tests, and canalicular probing and&#xD;
      irrigation (P&amp;I). While complete obstruction is relatively easily determined, partial&#xD;
      obstruction is more difficult. Each of the available tests is qualitative in nature and is&#xD;
      unable to determine the degree of partial obstruction. [1, 2] Current management options for&#xD;
      the treatment of partial nasolacrimal duct obstruction include repeated canalicular probing&#xD;
      and irrigation, balloon catheter dilation with placement of silicone stents, and&#xD;
      dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) surgery. Repeated probing and irrigation may be performed in the&#xD;
      clinic without anesthesia, but has a low rate of improved symptoms. Balloon catheter dilation&#xD;
      with stent placement is typically performed under general anesthesia, requires no incisions,&#xD;
      and has a success rate between 60-73%.[3, 4]. DCR surgery, also typically performed under&#xD;
      general anesthesia, surgically bypasses the nasolacrimal duct by removing a window of bone&#xD;
      and anastomosing the lacrimal sac to the nasal cavity. The success rate of DCR is over&#xD;
      95%.[1, 5] There are two previously published methods to measure lacrimal drainage&#xD;
      resistance. In 1991, Stanley and Masri described a device to measure resistance with a&#xD;
      hand-held instrument connected to a personal computer.[6] They reported values from 13 normal&#xD;
      controls, but did not test the device in patients with tearing. In 1995, Tucker et al.&#xD;
      reported a laboratory-based device that measured the resistance to fluid flow in the lacrimal&#xD;
      drainage system.[2] They measured resistance in healthy controls, in patients after&#xD;
      successful DCR, and in one tearing patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will measure the pressure generated during conventional P&amp;I using a&#xD;
      disposable in-line pressure transducer. In addition, the investigators will use a syringe&#xD;
      pump to deliver a constant flow rate of saline through a nasolacrimal cannula and measure the&#xD;
      steady state irrigation pressure using the in-line transducer and digital pressure monitor.&#xD;
      Resistance can be directly calculated from the known flow rate and pressure measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical applications for measuring lacrimal drainage resistance include quantifying partial&#xD;
      nasolacrimal duct obstruction, guiding the choice of surgical procedure, and determining the&#xD;
      success of lacrimal drainage procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Study Design and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to measure lacrimal drainage resistance in consented patients&#xD;
      undergoing evaluation and management of epiphora who require traditional probing and&#xD;
      irrigation. In addition to the traditional probing and irrigation of the nasolacrimal system,&#xD;
      the investigators will measure the lacrimal drainage resistance using our study equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accrual Goals and Recruitment Period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The accrual goal for this study is 40 eligible patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final clinical diagnosis of lacrimal drainage obstruction versus functional tear pump&#xD;
      failure will be based upon the investigators clinical findings and standard probing and&#xD;
      irrigation results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Entry:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient eligibility will be determined by the study's principal investigator or&#xD;
      co-investigators and as described in this protocol. The investigator will interview eligible&#xD;
      patients and explain in detail the purpose of the study. Those patients who agree to&#xD;
      participate will have the pressure measured during conventional P&amp;I and lacrimal drainage&#xD;
      resistance measured in addition to the normal clinical work-up. For those patients who agree&#xD;
      to participate in the study, signing the informed consent constitutes study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time Requirement:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators estimate that it will take 2 months for patient accrual and measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no required follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two measurements will be obtained from each patient. First, the investigators will record the&#xD;
      pressure generated during traditional probing and irrigation using a disposable in-line&#xD;
      pressure transducer. Second, the investigators will measure the pressure generated using a&#xD;
      syringe pump to deliver a constant flow rate. The investigators will then directly calculate&#xD;
      the resistance to irrigation from the pressure and flow rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Study Procedure: The Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Probing and irrigation (P&amp;I) of the lacrimal drainage system is a standard component of the&#xD;
      evaluation of tearing patients. During this procedure, a nasolacrimal cannula is inserted&#xD;
      into the canaliculus and saline solution is irrigated through the system. The investigators&#xD;
      will measure the pressure generated during P&amp;I using a disposable in-line pressure&#xD;
      transducer. In addition to conventional P&amp;I, consented patients would undergo a second&#xD;
      irrigation procedure using our measuring equipment. In order to eliminate any bias due to the&#xD;
      order of testing, half of the patients will undergo conventional P&amp;I first, and half will&#xD;
      undergo the experimental P&amp;I first. During the experimental P&amp;I, a syringe pump will deliver&#xD;
      a constant flow rate of saline through a nasolacrimal cannula. The investigators will measure&#xD;
      the steady state irrigation pressure using an in-line transducer and digital pressure&#xD;
      monitor. Resistance will be calculated from the known flow rate and pressure measurements.&#xD;
      The investigators will obtain three measurements from each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The syringe pump is designed to prevent backflow of saline, and in addition the disposable&#xD;
      portion of the pressure transducer exposed to the saline will be changed between each&#xD;
      patient. The syringe pump has an automatic safety cut-off if the line is occluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Interpretation of Data&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will record the pressure generated during conventional P&amp;I and the average&#xD;
      pressure generated during steady-state irrigation. Resistance will be directly calculated&#xD;
      from the average pressure measurement. The investigators will compare both the pressure&#xD;
      generated during P&amp;I and the lacrimal drainage resistance between patients with lacrimal&#xD;
      drainage obstruction and controls patients with no obstruction (functional tear pump failure)&#xD;
      as determined by clinical exam. The investigators will summarize data in terms of means and&#xD;
      standard deviations. The null hypothesis, that there are no differences between groups, will&#xD;
      be tested by a two-sample Students t-test with p &lt; .05 for rejection of the null. For&#xD;
      lacrimal drainage resistance, a sample size of 17 patients per group gives a power of 0.91 to&#xD;
      detect a difference as small as 20 mmHg*sec/ml. The power measurements are based upon the&#xD;
      work of Tucker et al., who measured an average resistance of 49.5 +/- 17.0 mmHg*sec/ml in&#xD;
      normal controls, and a single measurement of 212 mmHg*sec/ml in a patient with symptomatic&#xD;
      tearing.[2] Technical complications will be noted and described. All patient information will&#xD;
      be a part of the permanent medical record and will be no different from the information&#xD;
      documented in standard nasolacrimal irrigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Consent Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to a verbal discussion describing the study, including the risks and benefits,&#xD;
      the investigators will provide patients undergoing evaluation for epiphora including&#xD;
      conventional probing and irrigation with a formal consent form, and the investigators will&#xD;
      provide a copy of this consent for personal reference. The proposed consent form is attached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. Adverse Events&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anticipated adverse events of conventional probing and irrigation are anxiety and&#xD;
      discomfort during the procedure, foreign body sensation for 12-24 hours following the&#xD;
      procedure, and irrigant or dye on clothing. Anticipated serious adverse events of&#xD;
      conventional probing and irrigation include dacryocystitis and damage to the lacrimal&#xD;
      drainage system including punctal rupture. The incremental risks of the experimental probing&#xD;
      and irrigation relate to the pump device. Because the pump device has an automatic safety&#xD;
      cut-off and pushes fluid at a very low flow rate (0.09 mL/s) the investigators believe that&#xD;
      the incremental risks are very low. Stanley and Masri reported one case of punctal rupture&#xD;
      using their experimental setup.[6] The investigators believe this is unlikely to occur in our&#xD;
      experiment because the investigators are using a standard nasolacrimal cannula to irrigate,&#xD;
      and the investigators are using a much lower flow rate (0.09 mL/s versus 0.25 mL/s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All adverse events will be documented in the data collection forms and brought to the&#xD;
      attention of the patient and his or her family as soon as possible after their occurrence.&#xD;
      Patients are provided with contact information for the principle investigator as well as the&#xD;
      Institutional Review Board in the consent form, and an on-call ophthalmologist is always&#xD;
      available for emergent care after hours. On-call ophthalmologists will have direct pager&#xD;
      access to the investigators and will notify them immediately of any adverse events&#xD;
      encountered in study patients. Serious and unanticipated adverse events will be promptly&#xD;
      reported to the Institutional Review Board by the principle investigator.&#xD;
