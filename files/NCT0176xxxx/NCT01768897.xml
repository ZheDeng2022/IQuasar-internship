      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of CPI-613 when given together with&#xD;
      cytarabine and mitoxantrone hydrochloride in treating patients with relapsed or refractory&#xD;
      acute myeloid leukemia. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as CPI-613, cytarabine and&#xD;
      mitoxantrone hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either&#xD;
      by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. CPI-613 may help cytarabine and&#xD;
      mitoxantrone hydrochloride work better by making cancer cells more sensitive to the drugs&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CPI-613 when administered with&#xD;
      high dose cytarabine, and mitoxantrone (mitoxantrone hydrochloride).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the pharmacokinetics (PKs) of CPI-613 following intravenous (IV)&#xD;
      administration in combination with high dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To observe the response rate (complete response [CR], complete response with incomplete&#xD;
      platelet recovery [CRi] and partial response [PR]) of CPI-613 in combination with high dose&#xD;
      cytarabine and mitoxantrone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To observe the overall survival of patients treated with CPI-613 in combination with&#xD;
      high dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of CPI-613.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive CPI-613 intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days 1-5, cytarabine IV over 3&#xD;
      hours every 12 hours for 5 doses beginning on day 3, and mitoxantrone hydrochloride IV over&#xD;
      15 minutes after the 1st, 3rd, and 5th doses of cytarabine. . Treatment repeats every 14 days&#xD;
      for up to 2 courses* in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: *Patients undergoing a second course of therapy receive CPI-613 IV over 2 hours on days&#xD;
      1-3, cytarabine IV over 3 hours every 12 hours for 5 doses beginning on day 2, and&#xD;
      mitoxantrone hydrochloride IV over 15 minutes after the 1st and 3rd doses of cytarabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 6 months.&#xD;
