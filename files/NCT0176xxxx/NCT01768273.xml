    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of PA-824 when given&#xD;
      with a single dose of midazolam, and to determine whether PA-824 inhibits CYP3A to a&#xD;
      clinically important degree as measured by the effect of PA-824 on the pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      midazolam, a known CYP3A substrate.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label, fixed sequence design. 14 subjects will receive a single dose of&#xD;
      2 mg midazolam, followed by a 2-day wash-out. Following the wash-out, all subjects will&#xD;
      receive PA-824 once daily for 14 days. All patients will receive a single dose of 2 mg&#xD;
      midazolam on the 14th day of PA-824 dosing. This study will evaluate 400 mg PA-824.&#xD;
