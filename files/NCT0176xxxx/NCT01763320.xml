  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with symptomatic stenosis of intradural arteries are at high risk for subsequent&#xD;
      stroke. Since the SAMMPRIS trial, stenting is no longer recommended as primary treatment,&#xD;
      however, the results of this trial, its inclusion criteria and its center selection received&#xD;
      significant criticism and did not appear to reflect our experience, neither regarding natural&#xD;
      history, nor treatment complications rate. As ICAS is the most common cause for stroke in&#xD;
      Asian countries, we are hereby proposing a refined prospective randomized multicenter study&#xD;
      in an Asian population with strictly defined patient and participating center inclusion&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The China Angioplasty &amp; Stenting for Symptomatic Intracranial Severe Stenosis (CASSISS)&#xD;
      trial, is an ongoing, government-funded, prospective, multicenter randomized trial. It&#xD;
      recruits patients with recent TIA or stroke caused by 70-99% stenosis of a major intracranial&#xD;
      artery. Patients with previous stroke related to perforator ischemia will not be included.&#xD;
      Only high-volume center with a proven track record will enroll patients as determined by a&#xD;
      lead-in phase. Patients will be randomized (1:1) to best medical therapy alone or medical&#xD;
      therapy plus stenting. Primary endpoints are any stroke or death within 30 days after&#xD;
      enrollment or after any revascularization procedure of the qualifying lesion during&#xD;
      follow-up, or stroke in the territory of the symptomatic intracranial artery beyond 30 days&#xD;
      The CASSISS trial will be conducted in 8 sites in China with core imaging lab review at a&#xD;
      North American site and aims to have a sample size of 380 subjects (stenting, 190; medical&#xD;
      therapy, 190). Recruitment is expected to be finished by Dec, 2016. Patients will be followed&#xD;
      for at least three years. The trial is scheduled to complete in 2019. In the proposed trial,&#xD;
      certain shortcomings of SAMMPRIS including patient and participating center selection will be&#xD;
      addressed. The present manuscript outlines the rationale and design of the study. We estimate&#xD;
      that this trial will allow for a critical reappraisal of the role of intracranial stenting&#xD;
      for selected patients in high volume centers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although SAMMPRIS trial has had an impact on the current treatment of intracranial&#xD;
      atherosclerotic (ICAS), criticism regarding to its design were still raised and remained&#xD;
      unsettled. In light of SAMMPRIS, medical therapy could not be good as it was; neither&#xD;
      stenting for ICAD need to be abolished, but rather its role needs to be redefined by future&#xD;
      prospective trials. Moreover, China is a developing country, and has the world's largest&#xD;
      population. Since 2010, stroke has been the leading cause of death in China and confers a&#xD;
      huge burden and effort on patients and health professionals. Compared with western countries,&#xD;
      ICAS is the most common vascular lesion in patients with cerebro-vascular disease, and is an&#xD;
      important cause of ischemic stroke and future recurrent events in China. However, its&#xD;
      treatment strategy and long-term result has not been well determined. The health burden in&#xD;
      China and ethnic difference of ICAS incidence as well as the willingness to continue clinical&#xD;
      trials, support the need for ongoing CASSISS in China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-CASSISS registry trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A registration pilot trial was performed prior to CASSISS. It aimed to test the credentialing&#xD;
      of interventionists and participating centers. From July 2013 to Mar 2014, 12 candidates were&#xD;
      involved in a competitive registration study of recruiting 100 consecutive patients. The&#xD;
      patients received stenting using Wingspan at each site. As for the candidate centers, the&#xD;
      following aspects will be considered: stenting experiences, peri-operative complications, and&#xD;
      the volume of stenting cases. Those met the following criteria were not involved into the&#xD;
      subsequent randomization trial: 1) each center performed more than 5 procedures; 2) clinical&#xD;
      results demonstrated the complication rates were more than 15% (stroke or death). At last, 4&#xD;
      sites were excluded and the remaining 8 were certified and invited for the final&#xD;
      randomization trial.&#xD;
