    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide proof-of-concept that directional stimulation, in an&#xD;
      intraoperative setting, is perceivable in a subject and is different from omnidirectional&#xD;
      stimulation. The tests will be performed using a dedicated DBS lead connected to external&#xD;
      neurostimulator.&#xD;
