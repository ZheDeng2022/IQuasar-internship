      Investigators will be evaluating an online video-game-based smoking cessation intervention&#xD;
      that will overcome barriers to treatment such as cost and sustainability. This videogame will&#xD;
      be the first of its kind, based on an evidence-based intervention shown to promote smoking&#xD;
      abstinence. The findings from this research will be of great public health significance&#xD;
      because of the unprecedented reach and relatively low cost, as well as the potential for&#xD;
      similar interventions to be developed for other health problems, such as alcohol or drug&#xD;
      abuse and medication adherence for chronic illnesses&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cigarette smoking remains the number one cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in the&#xD;
      U.S. A number of barriers have been noted that prevent access to smoking cessation&#xD;
      interventions, such as lack of clinician training, the time commitment required to implement&#xD;
      treatments, and the costs associated with treatment. Thus, it is critically important that&#xD;
      more effective interventions be developed, and be made accessible at a relatively low cost,&#xD;
      to smokers. We recently developed an Internet-based Contingency Management Intervention&#xD;
      (CM),, where participants submit web-camera recorded videos as they exhale into a CO monitor,&#xD;
      and they earn money for abstinence. Although the costs associated with providing monetary&#xD;
      incentives contingent on smoking abstinence are likely to be less than the costs associated&#xD;
      with medical complications caused by smoking, the cost of incentives is often cited as a&#xD;
      barrier to CM. Thus, the goals of the present proposal are to markedly decrease costs and&#xD;
      increase sustainability of this highly accessible Internet-based CM for smoking cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using an iterative development process with the help of a team of experts, a social strategy&#xD;
      video game intended to be fun and engaging will be developed for Facebook (&quot;Quitters,&#xD;
      Incorporated&quot;). Treatment-seeking smokers will be able to earn incentives contingent on&#xD;
      meeting web-camera verified CO values consistent with smoking abstinence. Three powerful,&#xD;
      evidence-based incentives will be harnessed in this CM. The incentives will consist of: (1)&#xD;
      individual contingencies that can be used to improve game play, (2) social contingencies,&#xD;
      such as positive feedback and virtual rewards, that can be given to other players to&#xD;
      acknowledge their success with abstinence and improve their game play, and (3) group&#xD;
      contingencies that will require all members of a group to meet abstinence goals in order to&#xD;
      unlock access to certain game features. After game development, we will assess the&#xD;
      feasibility, acceptability, enjoyability, and preliminary efficacy of video-game-based CM for&#xD;
      smoking cessation. A 7-week pilot study will involve randomly assigning participants (N=100)&#xD;
      to either: (1) abstinent contingent, where incentives will be delivered contingent on&#xD;
      quitting smoking, or (2) submission contingent, where incentives will be delivered contingent&#xD;
      on submitting videos, but independent of quitting smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcomes of the pilot study will impact future research in the development of&#xD;
      video-game-based CM interventions for smoking, as well as for alcohol and other drug use, and&#xD;
      medication compliance in diabetes, asthma, and other conditions. Game-based CM will promote&#xD;
      widespread access to this innovative, fun, sustainable intervention at a relatively low cost&#xD;
      (the game will be available to play for free), thereby offering the potential to have a&#xD;
      substantial public health impact.&#xD;
