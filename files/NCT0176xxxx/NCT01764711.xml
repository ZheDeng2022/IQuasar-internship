  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to determine different chemical levels in the blood during a low salt diet.&#xD;
      This study will compare normal volunteers to those with Postural Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with postural tachycardia syndrome had a subnormal increment in aldosterone with&#xD;
      upright posture, which might reflect a blunted adrenal response to stimulation upon assuming&#xD;
      upright posture. In this AIM, we propose to assess the adrenal response to aldosterone&#xD;
      stimulation with intravenous adrenocorticotropin hormone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this protocol, subjects enrolled in the parent study will be approached about this&#xD;
      sub-study. Subjects will be assured that they are not required to participate in this study&#xD;
      even if they choose to participate in the parent study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no randomization for this specific sub-study. The order of diets (low sodium&#xD;
      vs. high sodium) will be performed as a part of the parent study, and not as a part of this&#xD;
      sub-study. This sub-study will only be performed in the LOW dietary salt phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be previously screened and evaluated as a part of the parent study. No&#xD;
      further screening will be performed exclusively for this study. Women of childbearing&#xD;
      potential will have had a serum pregnancy test as a part of the parent study. Pregnant women&#xD;
      will not be allowed to participate.&#xD;
