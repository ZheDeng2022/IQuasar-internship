  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase I, first in human, dose-escalation study of MORAb-066, an&#xD;
      investigational humanized immunoglobulin G (IgG) monoclonal antibody (mAb) that targets&#xD;
      TF-expressing malignancies that include breast, pancreatic, colorectal, and non-small-cell&#xD;
      lung cancer (NSCLC) (adenocarcinoma). This open-label study will assess the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of MORAb-066 administered weekly. This study will identify&#xD;
      the MTD when MORAb-066 is administered IV once weekly on a 28-day cycle.&#xD;

      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To evaluate the safety and tolerability of weekly intravenous (IV) infusions of MORAb-066.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify the dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) and to determine the maximum tolerated&#xD;
           dose (MTD) of MORAb-066.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of MORAb-066.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify, on the basis of safety, PK, and pharmacodynamics (PDx) data, a recommended&#xD;
           Phase II dose and schedule for MORAb-066.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To make a preliminary assessment of the antitumor activity of MORAb-066.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To detect any antibody response (i.e., human antihuman antibodies [HAHA]) to multiple IV&#xD;
           infusions to MORAb-066.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the presence of tissue factor (TF) substrates such as protease activated&#xD;
           receptor 2 when applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the archived tumor tissue for TF overexpression by immunohistochemistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate whether there are potential biomarkers that correlate responses to&#xD;
           MORAb-066.&#xD;
