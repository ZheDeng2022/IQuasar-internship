  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of the GL-ONC1 vaccinia virus at different&#xD;
      dose levels. The investigators want to find out what effects, good and/or bad, it has on the&#xD;
      patient and the malignant pleural effusion. A malignant pleural effusion is a build up of&#xD;
      fluid in the chest cavity cause by the cancer.&#xD;

    <measure>Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>MTD is to provide a dosing recommendation for subsequent Phase II studies. Three patients will be enrolled in each cohort at the dose levels shown in the table below in order to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD). At the beginning of a new dose level, only one patient will be treated. The first patient in each cohort must be treated and complete 14 days of post-treatment evaluation prior to the treatment of the remaining two patients in that cohort.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>safety</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The safety, tolerability and feasibility of GL-ONC1 will be assessed by the evaluation of the type, frequency, and severity of adverse events (AEs), changes in clinical laboratory tests (hematological and chemistry), immunogenicity and physical examination. All AEs and laboratory toxicities will be graded on the CTCAE (version 4).</description>

    <measure>detection of virus in body fluids</measure>
    <time_frame>days 2, 3, 4, &amp; 5. pretreatment</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will undergo serial sampling of blood, sputum, urine samples and pleural drainage for evaluation of viral particles by VPA immediately before treatment, and on days 2, 3, 4 and 5 pretreatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>evaluation of viral appearance in tumor</measure>
    <time_frame>2-9 days after intrapleural instillation of virus</time_frame>
    <description>Unless medically contraindicated, patients will undergo Video-Assisted Thoracic Surgery (VATS) with pleural biopsies to assess for green fluorescent protein (GFP) viral expression in tumor and surrounding tissues, and if appropriate, to perform pleurodesis at 2-7 days after intrapleural instillation of virus. Random pleural biopsies and GFP-directed biopsies will be performed to allow for assessment of viral presence. Viral plaque assays (VPA) will be performed in tumor biopsies. Immunohistochemical (IHC) and beta-glucuronidase assay staining for GL-ONC1 will be performed on both GFP (-) and (+) areas at videothoracoscopy (if applicable).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Therapeutic efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>day 60 post treatment (+/-10 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Therapeutic efficacy will be investigated with CT scans pretreatment and at Day 60 (+/-10) posttreatment. Response by RECIST criteria (and by modified RECIST - for mesothelioma tumors) will be summarized for each dose level using descriptive statistics.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of histologically or cytologically documented, malignant pleural effusions&#xD;
             (primary non-small-cell lung carcinoma, mesothelioma, and other histologies), who have&#xD;
             free pleural space (partial or total) that permits the intrapleural drug instillation.&#xD;
             This includes cytologically negative pleural effusion in conjunction with&#xD;
             histologically proven malignancy involving the pleura.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age must be ≥ 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All acute toxic effects of any prior radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or surgical&#xD;
