  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goals of this work are: a) to establish a unique collection of mood disorder&#xD;
      patients across the life cycle, including children, adults and geriatric patients, with&#xD;
      well-defined medical co-morbidities and medication treatment outcomes at the University&#xD;
      Hospitals Case Medical Center Department of Psychiatry; b) to establish a collection of&#xD;
      nuclear families, including both mothers and fathers, of children diagnosed with mood&#xD;
      disorders; c) to perform a systematic genetic analysis of the proposed sample repository to&#xD;
      identify genes and genetic variants contributing to inter-patient variability in clinical&#xD;
      phenotypes and treatment responses. Our primary hypothesis is that genetic variations may&#xD;
      underlie individual variability in disease susceptibility, clinical phenotypes and treatment&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, and effectiveness.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study entails a one-time blood draw that will be used to obtain phenotypic data and DNA&#xD;
      of all eligible mood disorders patients, and their parents (if applicable), who are treated&#xD;
      within the Psychiatry Department at University Hospitals Case Medical Center (UHCMC). In rare&#xD;
      instances, if a participant is unable to cooperate with a blood draw, a saliva sample will be&#xD;
      collected instead of drawing blood. All eligible participants will be diagnosed with bipolar&#xD;
      disorder or major depressive disorder, or be a parent of a child diagnosed with bipolar&#xD;
      disorder or major depressive disorder, and will be seen for the study visit at the Department&#xD;
      of Psychiatry at University Hospitals of Cleveland, 10524 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH,&#xD;
      44106. Required lab specimens will be collected at University Hospitals Laboratory Services&#xD;
      or the Department of Psychiatry, and analyzed at UHCMC and Case Western Reserve University&#xD;
      (CWRU) or at an NIH sponsored sequencing or genotyping laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DNA sample from eligible subjects will undergo whole genome genetic analysis using&#xD;
      array-based genotyping or sequencing technologies. The clinical phenotypes, treatment&#xD;
      response profiles and genotype data will be analyzed using single and multivariate analyses&#xD;
      in order to identify genes and genomic regions contributing to inter-patient variability in&#xD;
      disease susceptibility, clinical phenotypes and treatment responses. Alternatively, as&#xD;
      sequencing costs decline continuously, the DNA samples may undergo targeted genomic region&#xD;
      deep sequencing or whole genome sequencing analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any clinical patient, research participant or parent of a child patient, seven years and&#xD;
      older, within the Department of Psychiatry will be targeted for enrollment. Eligible&#xD;
      participants will be diagnosed with DSM-IV bipolar disorder (type I, II, or not otherwise&#xD;
      specified) or DSM-IV major depressive disorder, as determined by an extensive clinical&#xD;
      interview and the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview-Plus (MINI-Plus) if&#xD;
      applicable or will be a parent of a child diagnosed with bipolar disorder or major depressive&#xD;
      disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary phenotype definition for the genetic analyses proposed here is DSM-IV diagnosis&#xD;
      (BD or MDD), phenotypic variables (comorbidities etc.), and treatment response, defined&#xD;
      either continuously (change in symptom measures) or categorically (response/non-response),&#xD;
      made on the basis of structured diagnostic instruments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, we expect the following types of phenotypic data (as shown in the attached&#xD;
      minimum data set CRF) to be available for majority of participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic information including gender, age and ethnicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Psychiatric diagnosis and history including age of onset and course of mood disorder&#xD;
           etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Family history of illness including psychiatric disorders, diabetes and cardiovascular&#xD;
           diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The additional clinical variables (from minimum dataset and clinical trials) may define mood&#xD;
      disorder subtypes that are more genetically homogeneous and therefore more likely to reveal&#xD;
      the influence of genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a participant has signed the informed consent form, a blood sample of approximately 4&#xD;
      teaspoons of blood, or a saliva sample of approximately half a teaspoon of saliva, will be&#xD;
      collected for DNA extraction. The DNA samples will be linked with phenotypic data collected&#xD;
      from the study participants. The blood draw or saliva collection and minimum data set&#xD;
      questions are the only procedures that participants will need to complete once they decide to&#xD;
      participate in the study. The informed consent form will specify that the demographic and&#xD;
      diagnostic information used for this study will be taken from participation within another&#xD;
      study or from the medical records of clinical patients; participants will not participate in&#xD;
      this study if they do not provide consent to use their data retrospectively.&#xD;
