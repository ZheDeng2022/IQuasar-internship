    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to investigate the efficacy and safety of OLT1177 Gel in&#xD;
      subjects with moderate to severe pain associated with osteoarthritis of the knee following&#xD;
      cessation of pain therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, repeat-dose, multi-center Phase 2&#xD;
      efficacy and safety clinical trial of subjects with moderate to severe pain associated with&#xD;
      osteoarthritis of the knee. Eighty-four subjects, randomized in a 2:1 ratio (OLT1177 Gel to&#xD;
      vehicle control) will receive up to 40 doses of the Investigational Drug (56 subjects OLT1177&#xD;
      Gel and 28 subjects vehicle control) over 14 consecutive days given 3 times per day (4 mL per&#xD;
      dose, TID on Days 1 - 13 with only one dose administered on Day 14, assuming TID on Day 1)&#xD;
      and will have safety data collected through Day 28. Subjects with moderate to severe pain&#xD;
      associated with osteoarthritis of the knee will be evaluated twice for eligibility: 1) at the&#xD;
      Screening visit; and 2) at the Baseline (Day 0) visit, after a 7-day washout period of all&#xD;
      pain medications except for trial provided Rescue Medication (500 mg/dose of acetaminophen)&#xD;
      for those that experience unacceptable pain during the washout and 14-day treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be encouraged not to take any pain medication during the 7-day washout period;&#xD;
      however, for the first 5 days they are allowed to take only Rescue Medication. No pain&#xD;
      medication, including Rescue Medication, is allowed during the 2-day pain intensity&#xD;
      assessment period or within 48 hours of the Baseline (Day 0), Day 7 and Day 14 visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to record and report their level of pain at different time points&#xD;
      throughout the 14-day trial.&#xD;
