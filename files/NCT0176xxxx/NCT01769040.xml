      This investigational trial will be assessing the effect of rifaximin on pathophysiology and&#xD;
      haemodynamics in the patient with liver cirrhosis, and addressing the effect of rifaximin on&#xD;
      several organs on marker level. The molecular and physiological effects of rifaximin will be&#xD;
      explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that intestinal decontamination with rifaximin in patients with&#xD;
      cirrhosis and ascites will interrupt bacterial translocation from the gut, diminish the&#xD;
      following inflammatory response, prevent splanchnic vasodilatation and portal systemic&#xD;
      contraction and thereby reduce the risk clinical complications to cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If rifaximin can correct small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and demonstrate improvement in&#xD;
      liver haemodynamics, renal function and systemic dynamics, then these effects may contribute&#xD;
      to the overall well-being of the patient and prevent complications to the underlying&#xD;
      cirrhosis such as risk of infections, progression of disease, and admission to hospital.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ascites is a frequent complication of cirrhosis, occurring in 50% of patients and is&#xD;
      associated with 50 % mortality in two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bacterial infections in patients with cirrhosis are frequent during hospitalization and is an&#xD;
      important precipitating event for the development of renal failure and hepatorenal syndrome,&#xD;
      hepatic encephalopathy and possibly also variceal bleeding. High Child-Pugh Score, variceal&#xD;
      bleeding and low ascitic fluid protein levels are associated with high risk of infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The infections are mainly triggered by gut bacterial translocation, the migration of&#xD;
      microorganisms from the intestinal lumen to mesenteric lymph nodes or extra-intestinal sites.&#xD;
      Some studies have shown derangements in the gut micro ecology of patients with liver&#xD;
      cirrhosis, partly due to a decrease in small intestinal motility, which could cause small&#xD;
      intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Combined with structural and functional alterations of the&#xD;
      intestinal mucosa and deficiencies in defense mechanisms, this bacterial overgrowth&#xD;
      contributes to bacterial translocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Circulating bacterial DNA is a marker of bacterial translocation that may enhance endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction and predict a poor outcome in cirrhosis and ascites. Selective gut&#xD;
      decontamination prevents spontaneous bacterial infections and improves survival in advanced&#xD;
      cirrhosis, such as in variceal bleeding and in patients with spontaneous bacterial&#xD;
      peritonitis (SBP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with advanced cirrhosis are, apart from having portal hypertension, characterized by&#xD;
      a marked systemic vasodilatation, an increased cardiac output and a low central blood volume.&#xD;
      This could be due to raised levels of endotoxins in the blood and the induced inflammatory&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This induces increased expression and activation of nitrogen oxidase synthase leading to&#xD;
      excessive NO production and further vasodilatation. Moreover, high levels of cytokines&#xD;
      (LPS-BP, Interleukin-6 and TNF-a), is associated with a lower systemic vascular resistance&#xD;
      (SVR) and a higher cardiac output (CO) in cirrhotic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In decompensated cirrhosis several vasoactive hormones are activated to counterbalance this&#xD;
      vasodilatation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In animal studies, it has been shown that oral antibiotics might reduce bacterial&#xD;
      translocation and the vasodilatation in the splanchnic vasculature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rifaximin seems to be an attractive alternative that exerts a broad-range of antimicrobial&#xD;
      activity including gram-positive bacteria. Rifaximin induces less bacterial resistance and&#xD;
      acts predominantly in the small intestine, the site of bacterial overgrowth in cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rifaximin has been shown to reduce the risk of hepatic encephalopathy, with less side effects&#xD;
      than traditional lactulose treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) is a marker of severity of cirrhosis and has&#xD;
      important prognostic value in the assessment of risk of complications to cirrhosis. An&#xD;
      uncontrolled study has suggested that rifaximin may decrease HVPG(8). A recently published&#xD;
      pilot study has furthermore suggested, that rifaximin might improve systemic haemodynamics by&#xD;
      decreasing cardiac output and also increasing glomerular filtration rate (GFR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This novel, investigational trial will be assessing the effect of rifaximin on&#xD;
      pathophysiology and haemodynamics in the patient with liver cirrhosis, and addressing the&#xD;
      effect of rifaximin on several organs on marker level. We will explore the molecular and&#xD;
      physiological effects of rifaximin rather than confirming evidence of its already known&#xD;
      beneficial effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that intestinal decontamination with rifaximin in patients with cirrhosis and&#xD;
      ascites will interrupt bacterial translocation, diminish the following inflammatory response,&#xD;
      prevent splanchnic vasodilatation and portal systemic contraction and thereby reduce the risk&#xD;
      of clinical complications to cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, rifaximin:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Will decrease portal pressure, measured as the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Will ameliorate the peripheral and splanchnic vasodilatation by a decrease in cardiac&#xD;
           output (CO) and an increase in arterial blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance&#xD;
           (SVR). These effects should also be reflected by a trend towards normalization of&#xD;
           vasoactive hormones.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Will improve renal function expressed as an increase in glomerular filtration rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Will down regulate markers of inflammation expressed as a decrease in proinflammatory&#xD;
           cytokines (i.e. TNF-a and interleukins) and high sensitivity CRP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Attenuate markers of infection, expressed by bacterial DNA and lipopolysaccharide&#xD;
           binding protein (LPS-BP).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Inhibit small intestinal bacterial overgrowth as measured by breath tests and intestinal&#xD;
           transit-time in a subgroup of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, placebo controlled clinical trial. We aim to randomize in the relation&#xD;
      2:1, including 38 patients for rifaximin treatment and 19 patients for placebo. These numbers&#xD;
      are based on power calculations demanding a power of 80% probability of a true finding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our trial population will consist of adult, legally competent patients with liver cirrhosis&#xD;
      Child-Pugh score B or C and ascites. Patients that fulfill inclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      recruited from hospitals in the capital region of Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be referred to Hvidovre hospital for liver vein catheterisation, a&#xD;
      diagnostic procedure included in the standard diagnostic programme for liver cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initiation of trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient is admitted to hospital and baseline investigations are performed, including&#xD;
      clinical examination, blood samples, glucose breath test, blood and urine culture, ascites&#xD;
      puncture, faecal samples, and examination of continuous reaction time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the second day of admission liver vein catheterization and assessment of renal function is&#xD;
      performed and samples of blood from femoral artery and hepatic vein is drawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then the patient is randomized to tablet rifaximin treatment or placebo for 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the period of treatment the patient is closely monitored by an outpatient visit and by&#xD;
      contact on telephone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the trial period, patients are re-hospitalized and the investigational&#xD;
      programme is repeated. After six months a register follow up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
      November 2012: Initiation of trial and enrollment of first patients. November 2014:&#xD;
      Enrollment of the last patients and investigations. May 2015: End of follow up and trial&#xD;
      lock. Spring 2015: Assessments and analysis of first data. Summer/Autumn 2015: Publication of&#xD;
      results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collaborating units:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Department of Gastroenterology, Department of Clinical Physiology and Nuclear medicine, Unit&#xD;
      of Radiology and Diagnostic Research and Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Clinical&#xD;
      Research Centre, all Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rifaximin tablets and placebo tablets are delivered by Norgine Denmark A/S, free of costs,&#xD;
      and labelled and packed by Region Hovedstadens Apotek.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Good Clinical Practice Unit, Capital Region of Denmark, monitors the trial. Patients are&#xD;
      screened for inclusion at Departments of gastroenterology, and internal medicine at hospitals&#xD;
      within the Capital Region of Denmark&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implications of the trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If rifaximin can correct small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and demonstrate improvement in&#xD;
      liver haemodynamics, renal function and systemic dynamics, then these effects may contribute&#xD;
      to the overall well-being of the patient and prevent complications to the underlying&#xD;
      cirrhosis such as risk of infections, progression of disease, and admission to hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is possible that trial participants randomized to rifaximin treatment will experience an&#xD;
      improvement in both kidney function and bowel function, with less distress, flatulence or&#xD;
      diarrhea. It is also possible that this group of patients will have fewer complications to&#xD;
      their cirrhosis, such as fewer admissions to hospital, fewer infections and a smaller risk of&#xD;
      variceal bleeding and SBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is also a possibility, but not certain, that participants randomized to rifaximin will&#xD;
      experience improvement in their mental status and their general condition, for example less&#xD;
      fatigue, better appetite and more strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this trial contributes to new knowledge about the foundations and scientific&#xD;
      background that causes the serious complications to liver cirrhosis, thus enabling us to&#xD;
      improve diagnosis and treatment of this disease and its comorbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pathophysiological and investigational trial, and besides the mentioned benefits&#xD;
      for the participant, he or she will also contribute to the possible development of new&#xD;
      treatment regimens for liver cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If intestinal decontamination with rifaximin alleviates the mechanism leading to&#xD;
      decompensation and its complications it may potentially have a clinical impact in advanced&#xD;
      cirrosis beyond preventing recurrent hepatic encephalopathy. The aspects are prevention of&#xD;
      spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in patients at risk of this disease, and potentially&#xD;
      prophylaxis for patients with biochemical signs of bacterial translocation.&#xD;
