      Project description&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research project title:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Influence of moderate exercise on blood glucose in type 2 diabetics and healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project description and objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obesity is so widespread in Denmark that 47% of the population is classed as overweight&#xD;
      (BMI&gt;=25) and around 13% of the population is classed as obese (BMI&gt;=30).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The strong correlation between obesity and type 2 diabetes (at least 2/3 of type 2 diabetics&#xD;
      are overweight) has led to many studies which look at different forms of exercise for this&#xD;
      group, because weight loss may improve the diabetes and even defer the onset of the disorder&#xD;
      and in doing so lower complications and increase long term survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For people who do not have type 2 diabetes, the work-induced increased sympathetic activity&#xD;
      will lead to suppressed insulin secretion and increased glucagon secretion. This increases&#xD;
      the endogenous glucose production from the liver and thus maintains a normal concentration of&#xD;
      blood sugar in a physical training situation where the demand for glucose has increased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The theory behind the project is that the mechanisms that help to increase glucose production&#xD;
      in the liver during physical activity are weaker in type 2 diabetics, which can cause&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia during and after physical exercise. In other words, we want to study the&#xD;
      liver's sensitivity to stimulus from physical work by patients with type 2 diabetes and in&#xD;
      relevant healthy control subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have indicated that this type of mechanism is not intact in type 2&#xD;
      diabetics; because the level of insulin does not fall as expected during or after physical&#xD;
      training. However, there are no existing studies that measure the liver's glucose secretion&#xD;
      using stable isotopes during prolonged moderate physical work. Measuring this will help to&#xD;
      clarify our understanding of glucose homeostasis in type 2 diabetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is very relevant, because it may be expected that the preferred form of physical&#xD;
      exercise of an overweight type 2 diabetic can be of moderate intensity and previous studies&#xD;
      also show that this form of physical exercise delivers health gains in terms of an&#xD;
      improvement in insulin sensitivity and a reduction in the level of insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to determine if the level of blood glucose stays constant&#xD;
      before, during and after physical training and to examine the liver's ability to secret&#xD;
      glucose accordingly.&#xD;

      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      A group of 20 people with type 2 diabetes and 10 control subjects are twice invited to the&#xD;
      laboratory, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The type 2 diabetes group consist of 10 individuals being treated with metformin and 10&#xD;
      individuals who are not being treated with Metformin. The latter group may be diet-treated&#xD;
      diabetics or diabetics who have stopped taking their oral antidiabetic agent for 72 hours&#xD;
      before the day of the experiment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the first visit, the following is carried out:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DXA scan, blood pressure measurement, determination of ECG and VO2-max on a&#xD;
           cycleergometer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood sample&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaire about everyday physical activity (I-PAQ)&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the second visit, the following is carried out:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3 days of carbohydrate loading prior to this day.(By diet recommendations).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Insertion of arterial cannula, blood sample extraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Insertion of venus cannula. Insertion of stable glucose isotopes over a period of 4.5&#xD;
           hours: 2,5 hours of relaxation in bed followed by 45 minutes of cycling on an exercise&#xD;
           bicycle (during continued isotope infusion) at 60% of maximum heart rate reserve, which&#xD;
           was measured on test day 1. Followed by relaxation with continued blood sampling and&#xD;
           isotope infusion, one hour after cycling ceased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age between 30 and 60 years old,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maximum oxygen consumption between 20 and 50 ml/kg/minute,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BMI between 25 and 35 kg/m2,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Normal ECG,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Must have a stable weight throughout the last three months and have a normal balanced&#xD;
           diet,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Can cycle for 45 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For patients with type 2 diabetes: insulin treatment,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECG that indicates cardiovascular disease,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Illness or medicine that may affect the results,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On-going weight loss diet&#xD;
&#xD;
      DXA scan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minimal radiation - The scan lasts from six to 10 minutes and the total radiation dose with&#xD;
      measuring is below 0.01 mSv (millisievert). This is approximately equivalent to the natural&#xD;
      daily background exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cycling test&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to this test, an ECG is carried out and the person is quizzed about his/her state of&#xD;
      health. Regarding all experiments, there is quick access to doctors in the laboratory. The&#xD;
      laboratory is equipped with a defibrillator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infusion with stable glucose isotopes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stable glucose isotopes occur naturally in the body, though in much smaller amounts. They are&#xD;
      not radioactive and require no special precautions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sampling&#xD;
&#xD;
      An arterial cannula is inserted, from which blood samples are subsequently taken. A sample is&#xD;
      immediately analysed (ABL analyser) for glucose and lactate concentrations and blood gases,&#xD;
      Hgb and Hct.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other blood samples are processed on a centrifuge and the plasma is frozen at - 80 Â°C until&#xD;
      it will be analysed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The plasma is analysed to determine concentrations of:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insulin, glucagon, cortisol, growth hormone (GH), adrenocorticotrophic hormone&#xD;
      (ACTH),C-peptide, catecholamines , alanin, concentration of ketone, cholesterol free fatty&#xD;
      acids,glycerol, glucose isotope (Ra) content before, during and after the cycling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The biological material (in the form of plasma) will be stored in a freezer. When the&#xD;
      experiment is completed, the material will be analysed in our laboratories. When all of the&#xD;
      analysis has been carried out, any excess materials will be destroyed. All materials will be&#xD;
      stored anonymously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
      At all times, the study will be carried out in accordance with the latest of Helsinki and&#xD;
      current Danish legislation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among other things, this includes voluntary participation and that test subjects can withdraw&#xD;
      their consent at any time and without having to provide any explanation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study protocol and the written patient information will be submitted to the Research&#xD;
      Ethics Committee of the Capital Region of Denmark and the Danish Data Protection Agency will&#xD;
      be informed. Patient inclusion cannot begin until a written approval has been received from&#xD;
      both of these institutions. Both positive and, negative and inconclusive results must be&#xD;
      published.&#xD;
