    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective randomized three armed, multi center study is to compare the&#xD;
      effect of two types of acupuncture and no acupuncture in 2-8 weeks old infants with infantile&#xD;
      colic. Group A will get standardized minimal acupuncture in LI4, group B will get&#xD;
      individualized acupuncture in different points according to symptoms and group C will not get&#xD;
      acupuncture. Parents (who register the infants crying) and the nurse they meet at the study&#xD;
      CHC are blinded.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infantile colic is a common problem, affecting 10-20% of newborns. Both the baby and the&#xD;
      parents are suffering and there is a risk that the early relationship is disturbed. There is&#xD;
      no safe and effective drug and the use of complementary medicine is increasing in spite of&#xD;
      weak or no evidence. Acupuncture releases different neurotransmitters and hormones, is&#xD;
      calming, gives pain reduction and affects digestion. Therefore it is reasonable that&#xD;
      acupuncture can have effect in colic. Acupuncture in infantile colic has shown promising&#xD;
      results in the few scientific trials conducted. These trials have evaluated the effect of&#xD;
      standardized minimal acupuncture in the acupuncture points Large Intestine 4 (LI4) (two&#xD;
      trials) or Stomach 36 (ST36) (one recent trial). In this prospective randomized three armed,&#xD;
      multi center study performed at Child Health Centers in three towns, the effect of&#xD;
      acupuncture in reducing symptoms in infants, 2-8 weeks old, with colic will be investigated.&#xD;
      Two types of acupuncture: standardized minimal acupuncture in LI4 and individualized&#xD;
      acupuncture in different points according to symptoms will be compared to an untreated group.&#xD;
      Parents (who register the infants crying) and the nurse they meet at the study CHC are&#xD;
      blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents will get information about the trial from nurses and doctors at Child Health Centers&#xD;
      (CHC) or from a web-site (www.spädbarnskolik.se). Parents who are interested in letting their&#xD;
      infant participate in the trial get further information and sign informed consent. The trial&#xD;
      is approved by the ethical board at Lund University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infant´s crying, fussing, sleep, feeding and stooling will be registered in a diary during a&#xD;
      baseline week. Infants who cry/fuss more than three hours/day, more than three days during&#xD;
      this week is included and randomized. Beside their ordinary contacts with their Child Health&#xD;
      Center (CHC), infants and their parents are invited to visit a study CHC twice a week for two&#xD;
      weeks, where they meet a nurse for about 20 minutes. Parents can describe their situation,&#xD;
      discuss the infant´s symptoms and get advice. This nurse is blinded to which group the infant&#xD;
      is randomized to. She carries the baby to another room and hands over the infant to a nurse,&#xD;
      trained in acupuncture. The acupuncture nurse randomizes the infants to one of three groups,&#xD;
      following a randomization list produced by the research department at Lund University&#xD;
      Hospital. Group A will get standardized minimal acupuncture: one needle is inserted about 3&#xD;
      mm in the point LI4 on the infants hands, unilaterally, for 2-10 seconds and then withdrawn.&#xD;
      Group B will get individualized acupuncture in points chosen by the acupuncturists according&#xD;
      to symptoms: maximum 5 needles are inserted about 3 mm in points recommended in a guideline&#xD;
      produced for the trial after discussions with experienced pediatric acupuncturists. Needles&#xD;
      are retained for maximum one minute. Group C will not get acupuncture but will otherwise be&#xD;
      treated similarly: they will be with the acupuncture nurse for five minutes while she holds&#xD;
      the hand of the baby and talks to it in a calm voice. The acupuncture nurse make notes about&#xD;
      bleeding and other possible side effects, and if the baby is crying. After approximately five&#xD;
      minutes the acupuncture nurse calls the study nurse who carries the baby back to the parents.&#xD;
      At every visit the study nurse asks parents if they have noticed any side effects, and asks&#xD;
      if parents believe their baby gets acupuncture or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the two intervention weeks and one week after the last visit to the study CHC parents&#xD;
      register the infants behavior daily in a diary. Statistical analyses will be made from the&#xD;
      diaries.&#xD;
