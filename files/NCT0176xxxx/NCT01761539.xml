      Fluid resuscitation for pancreatitis is recommended given evidence that hemoconcentration is&#xD;
      associated with necrosis. However, there is insufficient evidence to support whether&#xD;
      resuscitation should be moderate or aggressive. In this study the investigators aim to&#xD;
      compare the clinical outcome associated with these strategies in a clinical randomized&#xD;
      fashion to determine the optimal treatment of acute pancreatitis.&#xD;

      TITLE: Moderate Versus Aggressive Fluid Therapy in Patients with Mild to Moderate Acute&#xD;
      Pancreatitis&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESES In the United States, acute pancreatitis results in more than&#xD;
      200,000 hospital admissions each year and has an associated mortality of 5%. While protease&#xD;
      inhibitors, platelet activating factor inhibitors, and somatostatin have been studied, no&#xD;
      pharmacologic agents have been shown to impact the course of acute pancreatitis and the&#xD;
      treatment remains supportive. Fluid resuscitation has been recommended based on animal data,&#xD;
      however, until recently very limited clinical studies were available to assess its impact.&#xD;
      Animal studies using rats, dogs, and pigs suggest that acute pancreatitis compromises&#xD;
      splanchnic perfusion and the pancreatic microcirculation. Work by Banks et al demonstrated&#xD;
      that hemoconcentration is associated with necrosis and inadequate resuscitation in those with&#xD;
      elevated hematocrit was associated with markedly increased rates of necrosis. Blood urea&#xD;
      nitrogen and creatinine levels also appear to correlate with mortality in acute pancreatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nonetheless, recent studies have yielded contradictory results regarding whether fluids&#xD;
      should be used judiciously or liberally. Retrospective work by Gardner suggests that early&#xD;
      resuscitation is beneficial. Other recent studies however including the work by De Madaria et&#xD;
      al suggest that those were received more than 4.1L of fluids during the first 24 hours were&#xD;
      more likely to develop organ failure than those who received less. In the only randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial of fluids in acute pancreatitis 76 patients with severe pancreatitis,&#xD;
      including those with renal failure, were randomized to massive 10-15cc/kg/hr (mean of 545&#xD;
      cc/hour) versus less aggressive resuscitation, 5-10cc/kg/hr. Rates of mechanical ventilation,&#xD;
      abdominal compartment syndrome, sepsis, and mortality were higher in the massive&#xD;
      resuscitation group In a well done prospective study by Wu et al 40 patients with acute&#xD;
      pancreatitis were randomized to goal directed management according to protocol versus&#xD;
      standard therapy and also randomized patients lactated ringers (LR) versus normal saline&#xD;
      (NS). They were unable to measure a difference between goal directed management and standard&#xD;
      therapy arm because the patients were managed very similarly in terms of volume of&#xD;
      resuscitation. The rates of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) were lower in both&#xD;
      groups, 25%, than the predicted level of 50%. It was demonstrated that those who were treated&#xD;
      with LR were much less likely to develop systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) than&#xD;
      those with NS. LR will be used in this study based on these results. The current study also&#xD;
      employs the system of checkpoints used by Wu et al with the intent to compare moderate versus&#xD;
      aggressive fluid resuscitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE: Precise fluid management strategy in patients with acute pancreatitis&#xD;
      is unclear. The investigators principal aim is to perform a well done randomized trial to&#xD;
      assess the hypothesis that aggressive fluids benefits those with mild to moderate acute&#xD;
      pancreatitis and help standardize the treatment of these patients. An additional goal of this&#xD;
      pilot study will be to determine the effect size of the difference between clinical&#xD;
      improvement in those receiving agressive versus moderate fluids with the aim of estimating&#xD;
      sample size for larger trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN: Patients presenting to the Los Angeles County Hospital with mild to moderate&#xD;
      pancreatitis are the focus population of this study. Pancreatitis will be diagnosed using 2&#xD;
      of 3 criterion; amylase or lipase greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal, epigastric&#xD;
      abdominal pain, and imaging consistent with acute pancreatitis. Available data suggest that&#xD;
      in those with severe pancreatitis aggressive fluid rescusctiation may be harmful and these&#xD;
      patients will be excluded.Patients will be randomized to aggressive versus moderate fluids&#xD;
      within 4 hours of diagnosis of pancreatitis. The inclusion and exclusion criterion will be&#xD;
      assessed. Randomization will be performed using a computer program with concealed allocation.&#xD;
      The amount of fluids and intervention performed in the emergency department prior to&#xD;
      randomization will be recorded but not affect randomization strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those in the aggressive hydration group will receive a bolus of lactated ringers (LR) of&#xD;
      20cc/kg and LR will be started at 3cc/kg of LR. This protocol was used in a well respected&#xD;
      prior randomized trial and was not significantly associated with fluid overload or other&#xD;
      adverse consequences. Those in the moderate hydration group will receive a bolus of 10cc/kg&#xD;
      and be started on LR at a rate of 1.5cc/kg/hr. Boluses will be given over 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 8-16 hours both groups will have a hematocrit, Cr, and BUN assessed (which is part of&#xD;
      the standard procedure of assessing the CBC and complete metabolic panel) in those with acute&#xD;
      pancreatitis.If patients in the moderate fluids group an increased or unchanged hematocrit,&#xD;
      Cr, or BUN they will be bolused with 20cc/kg of LR and fluids thereafter adjusted to&#xD;
      3cc/kg/hr of LR. Those in the aggressive group who have decreased hematocrit, Cr, and BUN at&#xD;
      this time will have their rate reduced to 1.5cc/kg/hr of LR. Those in the aggressive group&#xD;
      who have an increased or unchanged hematocrit, Cr, or BUN will receive a second bolus of&#xD;
      20cc/kg of LR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 20-28 hours the hematocrit, BUN, and Cr will again be assessed and the same measures will&#xD;
      be taken based on the levels. On the second day their diet will be advanced to clears if the&#xD;
      have a decreased HCT, BUN, Cr and are afebrile and have only minimal epigastric pain. Once&#xD;
      patients are tolerating a regular diet without difficulty their fluids will be decreased at&#xD;
      the discretion of their treating physicians. Patients will be assessed for symptomatic fliud&#xD;
      overload at each of the checkpoints as well as throughout their stay. If they develop fluid&#xD;
      overload including pitting edema, ascites, anasacra, pulmonary edema, or dyspnea will have&#xD;
      their fluids halted and be managed at the discretion of their treating physicians. Patients&#xD;
      who develop oliguria, anuria or hypotension will also be removed from the treatment protocol&#xD;
      as these findings signify renal failure and severe pancreatitis which are endpoints. If&#xD;
      patients continue to have rising Cr, BUN, or HCT after the second checkpoint, ie at 32-36&#xD;
      hours they will also be removed from the treatment protocol as this signifies that they are&#xD;
      refractory to fluid resuscitation and will be managed at the discretion of their treating&#xD;
      physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SELECTION AND WITHDRAWAL OF SUBJECTS: See inclusion and exclusion criterion&#xD;
&#xD;
      STRATIFICATION/RANDOMIZATION SCHEME: Stratification factors. Patients will not be stratified&#xD;
      prospectively. At the end of the study subgroup analysis will be performed to compare be&#xD;
      stratified into 3 groups; the results of those with gallstone pancreatitis, alcoholic&#xD;
      pancreatitis, and other pancreatitis due to other origins.There will be a randomization of&#xD;
      patients to moderate versus aggressive fluids groups. Group randomization will be balanced.&#xD;
      Randomization will be performed by the SC-CTSI Bioinformatics and Bioinformatics Group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY: If patients develop fluid overload including pitting edema, ascites,&#xD;
      anasacra, pulmonary edema, or dyspnea will be removed from the treatment protocol and be&#xD;
      managed at the discretion of their treating physicians. Adverse events will be reported to&#xD;
      the IRB and data safety monitoring board comprised of the principal investigators from&#xD;
      medicine/gastroenterology, emergency medicine, and surgery as well as the entire study team.&#xD;
      An outside senior physician from gastroenterology or surgery will also participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION AND ENDPOINT DEFINITIONS: See Primary and Secondary As a pilot&#xD;
      project an additional goal of this study will be to measure effect sizes such that larger&#xD;
      trials of moderate versus aggeressive fluids may be informed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS: Descriptive statistics will be performed for each group, and&#xD;
      comparisons made to determine if the groups are balanced on the stratification factor of type&#xD;
      of pancreatitis. Patient characteristics will be compared between groups as well to determine&#xD;
      if there is imbalance on other possible covariates. We expect that 40% of participants will&#xD;
      present with gallstones, 40% with alcoholic pancreatitis, and 20% of the sample will have&#xD;
      pancreatitis due to other causes. Approximately, 60% of our sample is expected to be Latino,&#xD;
      and the gender ratio is expected to be balanced. Patients will be classified afterward as&#xD;
      mild if the hospitalization &gt;3 days in length, moderate if the hospitalization was 3-10 days,&#xD;
      and severe if greater than 10 days or if necrosis and complications of pancreatitis develop..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because this is a pilot study, any variable for which there is a P &lt; .10 difference between&#xD;
      groups will be included in analyses as a possible confounder. For the primary outcomes of&#xD;
      evaluating the proportion of patients in each group who improved with assigned treatment, a&#xD;
      chi squared analysis will be performed at 8-16 hours and at 20-28 hours to evaluate the&#xD;
      number of participants receiving moderate fluids. Logistic regression modeling will be used&#xD;
      to test differences in rates controlling for covariates. Survivial analysis will be used to&#xD;
      explore the secondary aim of determining if there is a difference in time to tolerating&#xD;
      normal diet. Exploration will also be made of the relationship of outcomes with patient&#xD;
      characteristics to determine if these factors need to be included in stratification for&#xD;
      future studies. All modeling will follow an intent-to-treat model where the primary factor is&#xD;
      assigned group, regardless of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal of this pilot study is to determine effect sizes, so odds ratios and confidence&#xD;
      intervals will be reported for use in developing a fully powered study. A sensitivity&#xD;
      analyses was peformed using G starPower to determine detectible differences. With the&#xD;
      proposed sample size of 60, there would be sufficient power to detect a decrease in the&#xD;
      proportion of participants requiring aggressive fluids at 8-16 hours of 17%, versus the&#xD;
      expected 50% in patients randomized to moderate treatment (alpha = 0.05, one sided; 1-beta =&#xD;
      0.80).&#xD;
