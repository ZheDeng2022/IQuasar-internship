  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis is a common problem in primary care. Long-term use of non-steroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for pain relief can lead to serious (gastro-intestinal,&#xD;
      cardiovascular and renal) adverse events, that can even result in death. NSAIDs differ in&#xD;
      their risk of side effects. Opoid analgesics are sometimes used as an alternative for NSAIDs&#xD;
      in patients with osteoarthritis. However, these drugs also can lead to serious adverse&#xD;
      events. Simple analgesics are first line treatment in patients with osteoarthritis. NSAIDs&#xD;
      and opoid analgesics should be avoided whenever possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Farmaka (www.farmaka.be) is a non-profit organisation that operates a nationwide academic&#xD;
      detailing service in Belgium since 2006. The academic detailing exists of face-to-face&#xD;
      educational visits to general practitioners in their practice by a trained visitor with a&#xD;
      medical science degree. The aim of these visits is to improve the quality of drug prescribing&#xD;
      in primary care. Small scale experiments in the past showed that academic detailing can&#xD;
      indeed improve prescribing behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study wants to examine if nationwide academic detailing on appropriate&#xD;
      prescribing of analgesics for chronic pain in osteoarthritis results in a better GP's&#xD;
      prescribing behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another research question is whether physician-visitors have more influence on prescribing&#xD;
      than non-physician visitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is also interesting to examine if the effect of a visit is larger if there exists a&#xD;
      longstanding relationship between the academic detailer and the GP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 4.000 general practices are located in a region where academic detailers of Farmaka are&#xD;
      operational and have received a visit at least once before. All these practices will be&#xD;
      divided into two study groups in a random manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first group of practices will belong to the treatment group. GP's from this group will be&#xD;
      offered a face-to-face visit on appropriate prescribing of analgesics for chronic pain in&#xD;
      osteoarthritis. The visits will take place between February and June 2013.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second group of practices will serve as a control group. GP's from these practices won't&#xD;
      be offered any visit at all during the year 2013.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reimbursement data for all GP's are available by request from the Belgian Intermutualistic&#xD;
      Agency (IMA). IMA data for 2013 will be available by the end of 2014. These data will allow&#xD;
      comparison between the treatment and control group on the amound and type of prescriptions&#xD;
      for analgesics in patients with chronic osteoarthritis pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A comparison of the prescriptions of practices that participate in the study and the&#xD;
      prescriptions of in practices that don't participate is also possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is funded by the Federal Agency for Medicines and Health Products. We hypothesize&#xD;
      that&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the academic detailing visits to GP practices on prescribing of analgesics for chronic&#xD;
           pain in osteoarthritis will improve prescribing of analgesics by at least 5%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the personal relation between the GP and the academic detailer, expressed as the number&#xD;
           of previous visits, is an important effect modifier&#xD;
