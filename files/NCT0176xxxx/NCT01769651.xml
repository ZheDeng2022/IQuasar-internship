    <textblock>
      Accurately predicting the risk factors of patients' suffering a drug overdose plays a crucial&#xD;
      role in effective prevention of drug overdose. In order to investigate possible risk factors&#xD;
      for drug overdose, the NHS Fife Research &amp; Development Office funded this project to be&#xD;
      carried out by a group of researchers based in the University of St Andrews, in collaboration&#xD;
      with the NHS Fife Addiction Services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To improve our understanding of drug misusers' risk of suffering a drug overdose, the&#xD;
      investigators focus on the factors that are associated with the aspects of the addiction&#xD;
      consultation process (e.g. verbal and non-verbal behaviours of clinicians and patients). The&#xD;
      investigators are particularly interested in how clinicians recognize and manage patients'&#xD;
      emotional concerns during consultations. Based on the empirical evidence in the area of&#xD;
      patient-centred consultation, the investigators hypothesize that successful management of&#xD;
      patient emotional distress is positively correlated with improved healthcare outcomes&#xD;
      including patient's feeling more emotionally valued and satisfied with the consultation. The&#xD;
      investigators also hypothesize, according to the research findings on the relationship&#xD;
      between facial expressions and suicidal reattempt, that some non-verbal behaviours during&#xD;
      consultation (e.g. patient's 'looking down' activity) are related to patient's risk of&#xD;
      suffering a drug overdose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining informed consent from clinicians and patients, the investigators will video&#xD;
      record a patient's first consultation session with a key worker within the NHS Fife Addition&#xD;
      Services. The investigators expect to collect a minimum of 16 consultations (about eight&#xD;
      clinicians with two patients per staff member) for this one-year pilot study. A validated&#xD;
      coding scheme will be modified to code patients' expressions of emotional distress and&#xD;
      clinicians' responses. Additional survey method will be also employed to collect demographic&#xD;
      information and patient satisfaction. The investigators hope the findings of the study will&#xD;
      improve our understanding of drug overdose risk factors and contribute to the development of&#xD;
      drug overdose prevention programmes.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug misusers present to addiction services a wide range of problems with the most serious&#xD;
      consequence of drug overdose being the threat to life. Accurately predicting the risk of&#xD;
      suffering a drug overdose therefore plays a crucial role in effective prevention of drug&#xD;
      overdose. So far, most effect have been focused on investigating predictive variables that&#xD;
      are related to drug misusers' subjective perceptions of coping abilities and measures of life&#xD;
      experience or treatment history. However, very little attention has been directed to the&#xD;
      factors that are associated with the aspects of the addiction consultation process, where&#xD;
      clinicians have a greater degree of control over patient interaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some initial empirical evidences suggest that clinicians' and patients' facial expressions&#xD;
      were predictive of suicidal reattempt. It was found that doctors showed a higher frequency&#xD;
      and intensity in frowning working with suicide repeaters than with non-repeaters. In&#xD;
      addition, repeater patients were found to have a higher activity of the mouth and to look&#xD;
      downwards significantly more often. This line of study has laid some foundation for a new way&#xD;
      of prediction through observation of clinician-patient interactions. We are therefore&#xD;
      interested in exploring some non-verbal behaviours of both clinicians and patients during the&#xD;
      consultation process that are potentially predictive of a patient's risk of suffering a drug&#xD;
      overdose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding how verbal communicative behaviours during the consultation process might influence&#xD;
      patient care outcomes, findings from other healthcare communication areas have consistently&#xD;
      demonstrated that patient-centred communication is positively correlated with improved&#xD;
      patient health outcomes. One key feature of a patient-centred consulting style is clinicians'&#xD;
      ability to verbally recognize and address individual patients' emotional distress. To our&#xD;
      knowledge, it is the first time to investigate how clinicians manage patients' emotional&#xD;
      distress affects patient care outcomes in a drug service setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No validated coding schemes so far have been developed to explore the relationship between&#xD;
      aspects of interaction and drug service outcomes. In other areas of healthcare communication,&#xD;
      the Verona Coding Definitions of Emotional Sequences (VR-CoDES) has been frequently used to&#xD;
      code patient expressions of emotional distress and provider responses. Although it has been&#xD;
      widely used in a variety of contexts from psychiatric contexts to dental settings, it has not&#xD;
      yet been used in consultations involving drug users. We are therefore interested to test the&#xD;
      applicability of the system in a drug service setting after a suitable modification. Drug&#xD;
      addiction consultation is usually an emotion-provoking environment and accurate perception of&#xD;
      patient emotions has become a precondition for empathic responses. The modification of a&#xD;
      validated coding scheme to be suitable for the drug service context will be the first useful&#xD;
      tool to help clinicians to recognize patients' emotional concerns and thereby improving the&#xD;
      quality of patient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the modified version of the VR-CoDES as an analysis tool, we aim to identify factors&#xD;
      that are associated with aspects of the consultation process, particularly the verbal and&#xD;
      non-verbal behaviours of both clinicians and patients, to improve our understanding of drug&#xD;
      misusers' risk of suffering a drug overdose. The main research questions are summarized&#xD;
      below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What communicative behaviours observed in the interaction between clinicians and drug&#xD;
           user patients are predictive of patent's risk of suffering a drug overdose? In other&#xD;
           words, we are interested in exploring what verbal and non-verbal behaviours of both&#xD;
           clinicians and patients during the consultation process predict a patient's risk of&#xD;
           suffering a drug overdose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We are also interested in exploring how clinicians respond to patients' expressions of&#xD;
           emotional distress during the consultation process and how successful management of&#xD;
           emotional worries might be related to improved patient satisfaction. Furthermore, we are&#xD;
           keen to investigate whether the Verona Coding Definitions of Emotional Sequence&#xD;
           (VR-CoDES) can be reliably applied to the drug consultation context after suitably&#xD;
           modified. In other words, whether patients' expressions of emotional cues and concerns&#xD;
           and clinicians' responses to them can be identified and reliably coded using the&#xD;
           modified VR-CoDES.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research design&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be a one year, pilot observational study with video recording of clinician-patient&#xD;
      consultation within a single site of NHS Fife Addiction Services, based in the Whyteman's&#xD;
      Brae Hospital in Kirkcaldy. In the future, more sites may be considered to achieve a larger&#xD;
      sample size when this pilot study is complete on NHS Fife single site, largely due to the&#xD;
      time constraint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Overdose Risk Assessment Questionnaire (ORA) and the Treatment Outcomes Profile&#xD;
      Questionnaire (TOP) are two questionnaires that have already been routinely used by the&#xD;
      Addiction Nurses within the NHS Fife Addition Services. We hope to exert a minimum extra&#xD;
      workload to the staff participants and will respect their normal implementation procedure of&#xD;
      the questionnaires. Two pieces of information obtained from the ORA questionnaire will be&#xD;
      included in the analysis. First, the overall risk assessment score on the first assessment&#xD;
      with a key worker before the video observation will be used to compare with the behavioural&#xD;
      factors emerged from the interactions for predicting patient drug overdose risk. For example,&#xD;
      high risk assessment scores might be correlated with a high frequency of patient 'looking&#xD;
      down' non-verbal behaviour. Second, some relevant information, such as depression and&#xD;
      emotional abuse, will be used as predictors for patient expressions of emotional distress&#xD;
      during consultation. Therefore some regression and correlational analysis will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similarly, only two pieces of information selected from the TOP questionnaire will be&#xD;
      included for analysis for this study. First, the number of days patients injected&#xD;
      non-prescribed drugs in the past four weeks obtained one months after the video recorded&#xD;
      session. This information will be used as an indicator of a patient risk of suffering a drug&#xD;
      overdose, as the primary outcome of the study. Frequency and duration of some behavioural&#xD;
      data gathered from the consultation interaction (e.g., clinician's 'frowning', patient's&#xD;
      'looking down') will be correlated with this outcome variable (i.e., the number of days&#xD;
      patients inject drugs). Second, patient's rating of overall quality of life obtained from the&#xD;
      TOP questionnaire will be used to measure patient satisfaction as the secondary outcome of&#xD;
      the study. Patient satisfaction will be also measured by a specifically developed&#xD;
      questionnaire immediately after consultation. Again, some multiple regression analysis will&#xD;
      be employed to explore relationship between predictor and outcome variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Main ethical issues The main ethical issues involved in this study relate to the recording&#xD;
      and storage of the images of clinicians and drug user patients and anonymity and&#xD;
      confidentiality of participants' information. We have taken every possible steps to address&#xD;
      these ethical issues and included some additional safeguard actions to deal with unexpected&#xD;
      incidents. First, initial raw data recorded on DVDs will be locked in a metal case for&#xD;
      temporary storage in the field and they will be secured in a locked cabinet in the University&#xD;
      of St Andrews once transportation from the field to the University is complete. Second, each&#xD;
      of the raw DVD files (i.e., each patient consultation) will be assigned a unique code and&#xD;
      then be digitalized and stored on a university computer internal hard disc for coding and&#xD;
      analysis. Third, these digitalized files will then be permanently removed from the computer&#xD;
      once the coding and analysis is complete. They will be exported, after face images being&#xD;
      digitally blurred, onto an external hard drive that will have all data encrypted and access&#xD;
      to data files password protected. These encrypted data will be stored for two years following&#xD;
      the end of the study and the original raw data on DVDs will be permanently destroyed at the&#xD;
      end of the project. An audit record will be compiled to allow inspection of the progress of&#xD;
      video data files from video DVD to computer hard disc for coding and then exporting to&#xD;
      external media for safe long-term storage. Audit will be monitored by the School Ethics&#xD;
      Committee on a 6-month basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to note that the faces of participants on the video data will be permanently&#xD;
      digitally obscured after the coding has been completed. We will only display video files to a&#xD;
      wider audience (e.g., at conferences) after face images have been blurred and informed&#xD;
      consent from the relevant participants have been obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to protect anonymity of personal details and confidentiality of information provided&#xD;
      by participants, we will assign a unique code to each participant so that participants will&#xD;
      not be identified on the data files. This coding book will be locked in a secure place and&#xD;
      only the research team members will have access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Participants Sampling framework: In order to answer the research question of how aspects of&#xD;
      clinician-patient interaction during addiction consultation predict drug misusers' risk of&#xD;
      suffering a drug overdose, it seems that the population of interest is all clinicians and&#xD;
      patients providing and using the addiction services in the UK. In practice, the ideal random&#xD;
      sample or a proportionate stratified sample drawn from the population is often not feasible&#xD;
      due to limited resource or time constraints. The sampling procedures adopted for the current&#xD;
      study is a mix of opportunity and purposive sampling. Opportunities presented themselves in&#xD;
      the form of patients being referred to the NHS Fife Addiction Services and all eligible staff&#xD;
      members and patients based in the Whyteman's Brae service site will be invited to take part.&#xD;
      Sampling is also purposive in that only the first session with a CDAS Addiction Nurse, where&#xD;
      the patient is naive to the Addiction Nurse with regard to interaction experience, will be&#xD;
      used to study the interaction. It is also considered important that sample patient&#xD;
      participants should include approximately equal proportions of men and women; and the age&#xD;
      profile should have representation from young and middle aged groups. Additionally, it is&#xD;
      also important to consider some demographic information such as age, sex and working&#xD;
      experience when sampling staff participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion and exclusion criteria: All CDAS Addiction Nurses, who provide a one-to-one&#xD;
      consultation service to patients, based in the Whyteman's Brae Hospital as part of the NHS&#xD;
      Fife Addiction Services will be eligible. All patients referred to the NHS Fife Addiction&#xD;
      Services by a Fife wide triage contact point or their GPs, who are to have a first session&#xD;
      with their CDAS Addiction Nurses, will be eligible. Patient with mental health problems as&#xD;
      well as those whose first language are not English will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment procedures: Staff participants are recruited through a combination of top-down&#xD;
      and bottom-up approach. Meetings with head of the service and team leaders (top-down&#xD;
      approach) and discussions with staff members (bottom-up approach) will take place&#xD;
      simultaneously, to introduce the project and encourage participation. At the staff team&#xD;
      meeting, information about the project and consent form with an opt-in reply slip will be&#xD;
      left with them after the meeting so that they have time (about 3-4 days) to decide whether&#xD;
      they are willing to participate. The consent forms will be returned to the research assistant&#xD;
      in a prepaid and addressed envelope. We need a minimum number of 16 staff participants&#xD;
      preferably with four male and four female between 25-65 years old. Newly qualified stff&#xD;
      members are encouraged to participate as well as those more experiences ones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obtaining patient consent will be achieved mainly through the help of the addiction services.&#xD;
      An invitation package is delivered to all potential patient participants from the Addiction&#xD;
      Services on behalf of the research team. As we need a minimum number of 16 consultation&#xD;
      sessions (eight clinicians with two patients per clinician), the patient participants will&#xD;
      preferably be eight women (four between 18-40 years old and four between 41-65 years old) and&#xD;
      eight man (four between 18-40 years old and four between 41-65 years old). The invitation&#xD;
      package will include an invitation letter, a project information sheet and a consent form.&#xD;
      Patients will be also given 3-4 days before they decide to participate. The consent forms&#xD;
      will be returned to the research assistant in a prepaid and addressed envelope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Procedures of data collection Observations of clinician-patient interactions during the&#xD;
      addiction consultation will take place at the consultation room at the Whyteman's Brae&#xD;
      Hospital in Kirkcaldy in the form of audio-visual recording. The whole process of recording&#xD;
      will take about 30 minutes depending on the complexity of individual cases. It is not&#xD;
      expected that the presence of the camera and researchers will have any detrimental effect on&#xD;
      the clinicians' delivery of the service, nor will this likely to upset the patients. We will&#xD;
      use a small sized digital camera and place it in a good distance (approximately 2m from the&#xD;
      clinician and the patient). The operation of the recording system will be well practised and&#xD;
      the setup will be completed in good time to minimize any possible disturbance to the&#xD;
      participants. The recording and storage of video files will strictly follow the ethical&#xD;
      procedures described in the main ethical issues in this application form, such as digitally&#xD;
      obscure the face images of relevant participants and secure data files in a locked cabinet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the research design (to collect a minimum of 16 consultation sessions with about&#xD;
      eight staff participants with two patients per staff member) and the availability of the&#xD;
      Addiction Nurses at the Whyteman's Brae Hospital, which is about 10 up to the date of this&#xD;
      proposal, we expect that each Addiction Nurse will participate in an average number of&#xD;
      approximately two video recording sessions, which will last about 60 minutes in total. This&#xD;
      average 60-minute total observation time for each Addiction Nurse could spread out in 5 or 6&#xD;
      days depending on the appointment with his/her patients. The total participation time for&#xD;
      each patient participant in the video recording session is about 30 minutes depending on the&#xD;
      complexity of the case. If either the clinician or the patient feels unhappy with the&#xD;
      recording at any point of the observation, the recording will be stopped immediately and any&#xD;
      recorded data will be destroyed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Overdose Risk Assessment Questionnaire and the Treatment Outcomes Profile Questionnaire&#xD;
      will be implemented as part of the routine practice by the Addiction Nurses. The Patient&#xD;
      Satisfaction Survey, specially developed for this study, is handed to the patient by the&#xD;
      research assistant before the video observation. It can be completed within 5 minutes at the&#xD;
      end of the consultation. Patients are advised to complete the survey with the absence of&#xD;
      their clinicians and return it to the letter box placed at the Reception. This is to avoid&#xD;
      possible pressure to provide positive comments in front their clinicians and protect&#xD;
      confidentiality of the information. There will be no follow-up questions after this initial&#xD;
      survey has been completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Data analysis All video data will be analysed using the Observer XT system. First, all&#xD;
      verbal and non-verbal behaviours of both clinicians and patients will be coded using the&#xD;
      modified VR-CoDES coding scheme. Both inter- and intra-coder reliabilities will be checked to&#xD;
      a satisfactory level (i.e., Kappa ≥ .70). Second, frequency or duration of certain behaviours&#xD;
      will be calculated to identify possible relationships between certain behaviours and outcome&#xD;
      variables (i.e., risk of suffering a drug overdose and/or patient satisfaction). Third,&#xD;
      sequential analyses will be employed to detect patterns of behaviours and identify more&#xD;
      complex behavioural relationships. In addition, some coded behaviours will be exported to&#xD;
      other statistical packages for further analyses such as SPSS. Data gathered from the survey&#xD;
      method, such as patient satisfaction with the consultation and patent previous depression&#xD;
      will be used as either outcome or predictor variables to be correlated with behavioural&#xD;
      variables from the interactions.&#xD;
