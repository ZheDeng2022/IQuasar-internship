      Gadoxetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA, Primovist)-enhanced MRI can affect on BCLC staging during the&#xD;
      initial staging workups of definite HCC patients with very early or early stage disease, but&#xD;
      with no suspicious intrahepatic HCC lesions by liver dynamic CT.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer related death&#xD;
      worldwide, and its incidence continues to rise even in the Europe and the United States.&#xD;
      Recent advancements in early diagnosis and treatment modalities have significantly improved&#xD;
      survival in HCC patients, but, only a small portion of them can receive curative treatments.&#xD;
      Treatment decision making in HCC is guided by tumor stage, which can be also affected by&#xD;
      tumor status at presentation.Thus, intrahepatic tumor status can be pivotal for treatment&#xD;
      decision making and for determining prognosis in HCC patients, especially in possible&#xD;
      candidates for curative treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current AASLD guideline recommends that HCC patients with typical HCC ≥1 cm by liver&#xD;
      dynamic computed tomography (CT) do not require further investigation to confirm the presence&#xD;
      of HCC, and that appropriate treatment can be initiated based on tumor stage. However, other&#xD;
      intrahepatic HCC lesion which is not detected by liver dynamic CT can be additionally&#xD;
      detected only by Primovist-enhanced MRI.Although few studies have evaluated the usefulness of&#xD;
      Primovist-enhanced MRI in HCC patients,most of these studies have been limited by the lack of&#xD;
      an evaluation of shift in HCC stage and by the inclusion of patients with suspicious&#xD;
      intrahepatic HCC lesions that had been already detected by liver dynamic CT. Furthermore,&#xD;
      given the poor prognosis of HCC patients with recurrence after curative treatments such as&#xD;
      liver transplantation, surgical resection, or radiofrequency ablation (RFA),accurate staging&#xD;
      workup is essential for intrahepatic HCC, especially in patients with a very early or early&#xD;
      Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staged HCC. To date, however, no evidence based&#xD;
      recommendations have been made regarding the benefit of add-on examination of&#xD;
      Primovist-enhanced MRI during initial staging workups in HCC patients who are candidates for&#xD;
      curative treatment after diagnosis by liver dynamic CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this prospective multicenter study, therefore, we will assess the usefulness of&#xD;
      Primovist-enhanced MRI during the initial staging workups of HCC patients with very early or&#xD;
      early stage disease, but with no suspicious intrahepatic HCC lesions by liver dynamic CT. We&#xD;
      will examine whether Primovist-enhanced MRI could provide additional information on BCLC&#xD;
      stage, by directly comparing to liver dynamic CT in these patients. Furthermore, we assess&#xD;
      whether add-on Primovist-enhanced MRI after a diagnosis of HCC by liver dynamic CT could aid&#xD;
      treatment decision making in these patients.&#xD;
