      The purpose of the study is to explore the efficacy and safety of H-Coil rTMS in comparison&#xD;
      to a sham H-Coil rTMS in older patients with treatment-resistant major depressive&#xD;
      disorder.Subjects will be randomized to receive H1-Coil rTMS or sham H1-Coil rTMS. The acute&#xD;
      treatment phase will last four weeks. Treatment is administered daily, 5 days per week (i.e.,&#xD;
      20 treatments). Depressive symptoms will be assessed using the HDRS-24. If subjects achieve&#xD;
      the pre-defined primary outcome criteria of remission (HDRS-24 score &lt; 10 and 60% reduction&#xD;
      in symptoms) they will continue with twice weekly treatment for two more weeks to ensure the&#xD;
      durability of the remission. Subjects who do not achieve remission will exit the study after&#xD;
      the acute treatment phase of four weeks. The blind will not be broken to subjects until the&#xD;
      completion of the study&#xD;
