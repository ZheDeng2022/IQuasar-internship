    <textblock>
      Heavy drinking (HD) is a risk factor for HIV transmission and is more common in HIV+&#xD;
      individuals than in the general population. HD adversely affects health directly and reduces&#xD;
      adherence to antiretroviral therapies (ARTs), in part due to alcohol-induced cognitive&#xD;
      impairment. Reduced drinking improves cognitive performance and adherence to ARTs.&#xD;
      Medications approved in the United States to treat alcohol dependence have a small effect&#xD;
      size. However, topiramate, FDA-approved as an anticonvulsant and a prophylaxis for migraine,&#xD;
      has a greater effect size in reducing drinking and promoting abstinence in alcohol dependent&#xD;
      individuals. To date, there are no studies of the effects of topiramate in HIV+ heavy&#xD;
      drinkers. The investigators propose to conduct a randomized, parallel-groups,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, 11-week trial of topiramate in 40 HIV+ heavy drinkers who want to reduce&#xD;
      or stop their drinking. There are three primary hypotheses for this feasibility and&#xD;
      proof-of-concept study. First, the investigators hypothesize that topiramate-treated patients&#xD;
      will decrease the frequency of their HD more than placebo-treated patients. Second, based on&#xD;
      scores from computerized neurocognitive assessments, the investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      topiramate and placebo groups will show similar performance on a battery of cognitive tests.&#xD;
      Third, based on self-reported medication adherence, the investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      adherence to ARTs will be greater in the topiramate group than in the placebo group. These&#xD;
      findings will provide preliminary data to support a more definitive trial of topiramate for&#xD;
      the treatment of HD in HIV+ heavy drinkers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A. General Design: This study will employ an 11-week, parallel-groups design (TOP vs.&#xD;
      placebo) to test the effects of topiramate (TOP) on HD by HIV+ individuals with a current&#xD;
      alcohol use disorder. We will gradually increase the dosage of TOP from 25 mg/day to 150&#xD;
      mg/day over a 6-week period to minimize adverse events. Random assignment to treatment group&#xD;
      and double-blind conditions will be maintained throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Recruiting: HIV+ men and women will be recruited through advertisements and by&#xD;
      collaboration with physicians in the University of Pennsylvania Health System (UPHS) who will&#xD;
      be invited to refer patients for whom heavy drinking in their HIV+ patients has created&#xD;
      medical concerns. Patients will be recruited using the following methods: through referrals&#xD;
      to the research center at the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn); by posting/distributing&#xD;
      recruitment materials in community settings with public posting areas or other means of&#xD;
      providing community access to materials (such as hospitals, town halls, public libraries,&#xD;
      YMCA, health fairs/organizations); and through advertisements in local media (including text&#xD;
      ads in newspapers, magazines; radio ads on local radio stations; web ads on internet sites&#xD;
      and web postings on community message boards and research listings). These methods have been&#xD;
      successful for Dr. Kranzler at the University of Pennsylvania and for many investigators at&#xD;
      the Treatment Research Center (TRC) at UPenn. The TRC is an active center for clinical&#xD;
      investigation and the staff and faculty there are highly experienced and capable in the&#xD;
      conduct of clinical trials such as this. We will use institution-approved recruitment&#xD;
      materials to advertise for regular or daily drinkers who are HIV+ and want to reduce their&#xD;
      drinking. We will obtain permission at selected locations before distributing or posting the&#xD;
      approved recruitment materials (to ensure that we comply with other institutions'&#xD;
      guidelines). We anticipate that approximately 40% of patients will be women and that minority&#xD;
      patients will be represented at least in proportion to the general population in&#xD;
      Philadelphia. Based upon the large number of potential patients and our success in&#xD;
      recruitment for prior studies, including those involving heavy drinkers, we are confident of&#xD;
      our ability to achieve our recruitment goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Study Visits: At the screening visit, patients will provide informed consent and their&#xD;
      reading ability will be evaluated, a medical and psychiatric history obtained. Blood and&#xD;
      urine samples will be taken for routine clinical laboratory evaluations (including GGTP),&#xD;
      drug screening, and pregnancy testing in females of reproductive potential. Patients will be&#xD;
      interviewed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID). Patients who are&#xD;
      excluded will be referred to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The baseline visit will occur 1-14 days after the screening visit. Eligible patients will&#xD;
      undergo a research evaluation, complete a packet of questionnaires, complete cognitive&#xD;
      testing, and be interviewed by the research assistant. A physical examination will be&#xD;
      performed by a study physician or nurse practitioner. Eligible patients will receive their&#xD;
      first counseling session and first supply of study medication during a subsequent treatment&#xD;
      session the same day. We will use urn randomization, a probabilistic balancing procedure to&#xD;
      assign patients to medication group so that groups are balanced on key variables (Wei 1978):&#xD;
      sex, race (white or non-white), number of HD days in past month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the 11-week treatment period, patients will return to the clinic weekly for five weeks&#xD;
      while the dosage of the medication is gradually increased and then biweekly for six weeks.&#xD;
      For patient safety during travel, they will be instructed not to drink prior to study visits.&#xD;
      At each visit, the patient's breath alcohol level, weight, and vital signs will be measured.&#xD;
      They will complete questionnaires and cognitive testing, and be interviewed by the research&#xD;
      nurse about their use of concurrent medications, the occurrence of adverse events, and&#xD;
      protocol compliance and then receive the medical management intervention. During visit 9 (end&#xD;
      of treatment week 11), patients will complete questionnaires and cognitive testing and be&#xD;
      interviewed by the research evaluator concerning their alcohol consumption. Patients will be&#xD;
      compensated for this end-of-treatment visit. Patients will also be interviewed by the&#xD;
      research nurse about their use of concomitant medications, occurrence of adverse events,&#xD;
      compliance with the protocol, and their assessment of the effectiveness and acceptability of&#xD;
      the treatment procedures (through the Medication Questionnaire; MED-Q). The nurse will&#xD;
      dispense 4 days of medication for the taper and instruct the patient on how to take the&#xD;
      medication during this period. Blood samples to measure serum GGTP will be obtained to assess&#xD;
      the validity of self-reported drinking. A study nurse or research coordinator will call the&#xD;
      patient one week after the endpoint visit to confirm that the subject completed the&#xD;
      medication taper. Continuing adverse events will be followed by the study nurse and physician&#xD;
      to their conclusion, as is feasible. Patients requesting (or clearly needing) additional&#xD;
      treatment for alcohol problems will be referred to local treatment centers. All patients&#xD;
      (including those who discontinue treatment prematurely) will be asked to complete an&#xD;
      end-of-treatment evaluation and to complete all scheduled assessments to facilitate&#xD;
      intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses. For patients who withdraw early and do not wish to&#xD;
      continue with study visits/procedures, all end-of-treatment procedures will be administered&#xD;
      at the time of withdrawal. Such patients will also be asked to undergo in-person or telephone&#xD;
      follow-up at end-of-treatment for collection of the remaining treatment-phase Timeline&#xD;
      Followback (TLFB) data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. Compensation: Patients will be compensated for their time and transportation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E. Study Treatments: Throughout the study, we will maintain double-blind conditions with&#xD;
      respect to medication administration. The research nurse, who is experienced in the conduct&#xD;
      of alcohol pharmacotherapy trials, will deliver the medical management and monitor the&#xD;
      medication, including capsule counts to measure adherence. The physician will meet with the&#xD;
      patient initially, meet at least weekly with the nurse to discuss progress, and evaluate the&#xD;
      patient in the event of severe or persistent adverse effects. The nurse will dispense study&#xD;
      medications prescribed by the physician. Patients with severe psychological symptoms (e.g.,&#xD;
      suicidal thoughts) will be withdrawn from treatment and referred for appropriate clinical&#xD;
      care. An effort will be made to obtain outcome information on all randomized patients for ITT&#xD;
      analysis. In the medication condition, TOP will be administered at a maximum of 150 mg/day in&#xD;
      two divided doses. TOP will be purchased commercially and formulated in opaque capsules by&#xD;
      the Investigational Drug Service (IDS) at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine,&#xD;
      which will purchase the TOP commercially and formulate the medication in capsules. Placebo&#xD;
      will be formulated to match the active medication, such that inspection of the capsules will&#xD;
      not permit the two to be differentiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      F. Assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory/Medical Assessments: These assessments are included to screen patients for medical&#xD;
      exclusion criteria, assess potential adverse effects of medications, and corroborate&#xD;
      self-reported drinking. Prior to entrance into the study, each patient will receive:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urinalysis and urine toxicology&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete Blood Count (CBC)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase Levels (GGTP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A chemistry panel (which includes electrolytes, liver enzymes, bilirubin, uric acid)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy testing in women of reproductive age (conducted at screening and then at the&#xD;
           midpoint of the trial).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the midpoint and end of the 11-week treatment phase, GGTP will be repeated to corroborate&#xD;
      self-reported alcohol consumption. In addition to eliciting self-reported adverse events,&#xD;
      weight and vital signs (blood pressure and pulse) will be obtained at each treatment visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychological/Behavioral Assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sociodemographic information and alcohol dependence family history will be obtained at&#xD;
           baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Locator information: At baseline, the research assistant will obtain information on&#xD;
           patient locators nominated by the patient, which helps to maintain patients in treatment&#xD;
           and enhances follow-up data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Psychiatric diagnosis: The Structured Clinical Interview(SCID-I/P; First et al. 2001)&#xD;
           for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV (DSM-IV) will be used at baseline to&#xD;
           classify patients according to the presence or absence of standard psychiatric disorders&#xD;
           according to DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association 1994).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alcohol use patterns and medication adherence: The Timeline Followback (TLFB; Sobell and&#xD;
           Sobell 1992) will be used to estimate current medication adherence and alcohol&#xD;
           consumption and drinking at intake and at each subsequent study visit. This interview&#xD;
           procedure will provide quantity/frequency of alcohol consumption data for the period&#xD;
           prior to the interview and since the last interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cogstate computerized battery: To examine the cognitive effects of changes in drinking&#xD;
           behavior and of TOP treatment, we will administer the 20-minute battery biweekly. We&#xD;
           will use these tasks: Detection Task, Identification Task, One Card Learning Task, One&#xD;
           Back Memory Task, Shopping List Task, Groton Maze Learning Test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) (Decision Making and Impulsivity) [15 minutes]: The IGT&#xD;
           (Bechara et al. 1994) is a computerized gambling task intended to simulate real-world&#xD;
           decision making. Prior research indicates that it is sensitive to cognitive impairment&#xD;
           in HIV populations (Martin et al. 2004) as well as substance users. Because practice&#xD;
           effects are possible, the IGT will only be administered at baseline, midpoint (Visit 6),&#xD;
           and endpoint (Visit 9).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Depressive symptoms: Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medication adverse effects: Patients will provide subjective reports of adverse effects&#xD;
           at each study visit using a list of adverse medication effects derived from completed&#xD;
           studies of TOP for AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adherence to antiretroviral medication: We will use the Timeline Followback method to&#xD;
           determine the percentage of ART doses taken each day as prescribed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Checklist of Cognitive Complaints: Individuals will rate their perceived impairment in&#xD;
           everyday function in the domains of attention, memory, and decision making.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General intellectual function: The Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR; Pearson&#xD;
           Education, Inc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dementia screening: The Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE)&#xD;

Medical Management: Medical Management (MM; Pettinati, 2004) will support patients' efforts to reduce their drinking. The study nurse makes direct recommendations for reducing drinking to sensible levels. The first session will use the brochure A Guide to Sensible Drinking (WHO 1996). The patient is provided with information about pharmacotherapy and the importance of adherence to topiramate/placebo. Subsequent treatment sessions (15-25 mins) will be conducted at each study visit, during which the nurse will perform an assessment of the patient's drinking, monitor his/her medication adherence, and make recommendations to follow until the next visit. Men will be advised to consume no more than 2 drinks/day and 8 drinks/week; women will be advised to consume no more than 1 drink/day and 4 drinks/week.</description>
