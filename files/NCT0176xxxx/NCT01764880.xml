  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heparanase cleaves heparan sulfate (HS) chains, a natural substrate for heparanase, and&#xD;
      participates in degradation and remodelling of the extra-cellular matrix (ECM) facilitating,&#xD;
      among other activities, cell invasion associated with cancer metastasis, angiogenesis, and&#xD;
      inflammation. The heparanase enzyme is a promising target for development of new anticancer&#xD;
      drugs. HS and the structurally related heparin are present in most animal species. As an&#xD;
      analogue of the natural substrate of heparanase HS, heparin is considered to be a potent&#xD;
      inhibitor of heparanase. SST0001 is a polymer with a heparin-like structure. It is a reduced&#xD;
      oxidized N-acetyl heparin, these modifications cause the reduction of anticoagulant activity&#xD;
      and are strictly related to the anti-heparanase activity. In preclinical murine models&#xD;
      SST0001 showed a significant anti myeloma effect in multiple myeloma mice xenograft models,&#xD;
      with a significant reduction of subcutaneous growth of different multiple myeloma cell lines,&#xD;
      when SST0001 was administered either alone or in combination with dexamethasone. The purpose&#xD;
      of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of SST0001 in&#xD;
      the treatment of advanced refractory multiple myeloma.&#xD;

      Multicenter, open label, uncontrolled Phase I First In Man trial in advanced refractory&#xD;
      multiple myeloma, to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of SST0001 given&#xD;
      subcutaneously (sc) once daily for 5 or 10 days, in a cycle of 28 days. A starting dose of 25&#xD;
      mg (flat dose) is given once daily for 5 days (from Day 1 to Day 5). In the subsequent cohort&#xD;
      25 mg are administered once daily for 10 days (from Day 1 to 5 and from Day 8 to 12). Dose&#xD;
      escalation with SST0001 administered for 10 days is performed in subsequent cohorts,&#xD;
      depending on toxicities observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indirect pharmacokinetics based on Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) modifications&#xD;
      in all patients (minimum of 3 patients in each cohort) during the first cycle of treatment&#xD;
      and direct SST0001 concentrations measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacodynamics in all patients during the first cycle of treatment, based on modifications&#xD;
      of coagulation parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study any hints of anti-tumor activity will also be evaluated based on use of&#xD;
      surrogate parameters (monoclonal serum and urine protein modifications).&#xD;
