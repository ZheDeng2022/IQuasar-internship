  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main clinical study will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, long term&#xD;
      study involving a 100 week treatment period. The purpose of this study is to test for&#xD;
      superiority of treatment with belimumab 10 mg/kg plus supportive therapy compared to placebo&#xD;
      plus supportive therapy in idiopathic membranous nephropathy (IMN). The purpose of this study&#xD;
      is also to investigate the effect of initiating earlier treatment with belimumab compared to&#xD;
      delayed treatment with current immunosuppressive treatment regimens. The study will also&#xD;
      determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of belimumab and further explore the mechanism of&#xD;
      action of Belimumab as well as effects on quality of life. All subjects (on either active&#xD;
      treatment or placebo) will receive background supportive therapy throughout the main clinical&#xD;
      study, which includes angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and/or angiotensin&#xD;
      receptor blockers (ARBs) unless contraindicated and may include statins, diuretics, dietary&#xD;
      salt restriction but excludes immunosuppressants (except low dose corticosteroids). Screening&#xD;
      will be done within 5 to 2 weeks before the first scheduled dose of study treatment. A total&#xD;
      of 94 evaluable subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio such that 47 subjects receive&#xD;
      intravenous belimumab 10 mg/kg and 47 receive intravenous placebo. Subjects will be dosed on&#xD;
      Days 0, 14, 28 and then every 4 weeks through to, and including, Week 100, resulting in a&#xD;
      total of 27 doses (giving 104 weeks of drug exposure). The dosing frequency will be adjusted&#xD;
      to every 2 weeks if the subject's proteinuria as assessed by urinary protein creatinine ratio&#xD;
      (PCR) is greater than 1000mg/mmol (greater than 10 g/24 h), to compensate for loss of&#xD;
      belimumab in the urine. Subjects who are withdrawn from study treatment at any time during&#xD;
      the study, eg for rescue therapy, will participate in follow-up visits every 12 weeks up to&#xD;
      week 104. A subject will be regarded as having completed the main clinical study if they&#xD;
      complete all phases of the main clinical study (screening, treatment period, 4 week and 16&#xD;
      week post last dose short term safety follow-up). Subjects who complete the main clinical&#xD;
      study will therefore participate in the main clinical study for approximately 28 months.&#xD;
      After the main clinical study, there will be a 5 year (long term) follow-up phase to assess&#xD;
      long term outcomes.&#xD;
