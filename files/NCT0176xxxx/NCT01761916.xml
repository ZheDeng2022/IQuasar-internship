  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The postpartum period represents a stage of the pregnancy-puerperal still rarely addressed&#xD;
      scientifically. There are no reports in the literature and concrete enough to elucidate&#xD;
      important issues, especially in the field of hypertension and pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Searches based on current evidence concentrate their focus on the diagnosis of hypertensive&#xD;
      disorders and treatment of these diseases maternofetais repercussions. However, the prognosis&#xD;
      in the short and long term, as the BP outcome in mothers with severe preeclampsia, the most&#xD;
      effective treatment for the control of hypertensive crisis and metabolic and cardiovascular&#xD;
      events after two years of termination of pregnancy require further clarification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main idea for developing this research came from the clinical experience with the use of&#xD;
      captopril in Obstetric ICU IMIP. This drug has long been used in postpartum women with severe&#xD;
      preeclampsia or chronic hypertension exacerbated by pregnancy for control of hypertensive&#xD;
      crisis and keeping pressure levels. Following the technical standards of the institution and&#xD;
      during his administration, there were reports of side effects such as dry cough and nausea,&#xD;
      beyond the threshold dose of 150mg daily captopril was easily achieved hindering control the&#xD;
      use of hypotensive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternative therapy, clonidine began to be used in mothers with some restriction on the use&#xD;
      of ACE inhibitors and its hypotensive effect for peak pressure was satisfactory. What is not&#xD;
      known yet is how long clonidine reduces high blood pressure and how long to leave stabilized&#xD;
      compared to the use of captopril.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no reports in the literature databases, no randomized clinical trials that prove&#xD;
      the effectiveness of clonidine for the treatment of hypotensive pressure peaks in this&#xD;
      particular group of patients, even in comparison with other classes of antihypertensive&#xD;
      drugs, especially captopril, to this purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' primary assumption is that clonidine has better effectiveness in&#xD;
      decreasing the frequency of pressure peaks when compared with captopril.&#xD;

      The investigators' primary assumption is that clonidine has better effectiveness in&#xD;
      decreasing the frequency of pressure peaks when compared with captopril.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A triple blind randomized clinical trial will be conducted. Postpartum women with&#xD;
      hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, admitted to the obstetric ICU of IMIP will be included&#xD;
      in the research. After inclusion in the study, drugs for for very high blood pressure,&#xD;
      according to randomization(captopril and clonidine)will be used. clonidine and captopril are&#xD;
      administered at a dose of 25mg and 0.1mg respectively. If there is no control of blood&#xD;
      pressure in 20 minutes new hypotensive doses will be administered until a total of 150mg/day&#xD;
      (six tablets) and Captopril 0.6 mg / day (six tablets) clonidine. After exceeded the allowed&#xD;
      dose, other drugs may be associated. Initially, nifedipine (30mg/day to 60mg/day) according&#xD;
      to the service routine. The goal of intervention is to maintain a systolic blood pressure&#xD;
      below 170mmHg and diastolic pressure below 110mmHg, with the lowest possible dose. Thus,&#xD;
      these medications will be increased should the need arise, according to measurements taken&#xD;
      daily by the attending physician and the nursing staff.&#xD;
