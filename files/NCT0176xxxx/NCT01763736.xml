  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this research study is to assess the effects of music on patients'&#xD;
      experience in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The hypothesis of this study is that patients&#xD;
      who receive music therapy will report a reduction in negative recollections and experiences&#xD;
      while on mechanical ventilation and will require fewer pharmacologic agents to maintain their&#xD;
      sedation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Music therapy has been applied in a variety of clinical settings to reduce stress, provide a&#xD;
      distraction for patients from unpleasant procedures or symptoms, and improve the overall&#xD;
      atmosphere and general comfort of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a preliminary study, investigators have found that subjects experience symptoms of anxiety&#xD;
      and stress. It is the investigators hope that providing music as an intervention will alter&#xD;
      subjects' recollections of their time in the ICU and creates a more positive ICU experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator aims to provide the music intervention, receive full questionnaire&#xD;
      completion and recall of subjects' experiences from a total of 40 subjects. Some subjects,&#xD;
      however, will not have recall of either the ICU or mechanical ventilation and, therefore, it&#xD;
      is predicted that it will require enrolling approximately 75 subjects to reach this goal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The music intervention will begin after surrogate consent is obtained. Each day while&#xD;
      mechanically ventilated, the subject will receive a morning and an afternoon music session&#xD;
      lasting one hour. If available, single subject use, disposable headphones may be utilized, or&#xD;
      music may be played directly through the computer speakers. Music sessions will occur each&#xD;
      day while the subject is mechanically ventilated or up to seven consecutive days. During each&#xD;
      music session, study staff will complete a clinical assessment(consisting of vital signs,&#xD;
      ventilation data and medications) at three time points during each music session. It is&#xD;
      anticipated that some subjects may only have 1 music session per day, or have to skip a day&#xD;
      due to clinical condition. If a subject is only able to have one music session on a specific&#xD;
      day or a day is missed, a subject will not be considered withdrawn from the study or&#xD;
      ineligible for further participation. This will be recorded on the source documents, and the&#xD;
      total number of music sessions will be analyzed during analysis. In addition, study staff&#xD;
      will not preclude additional music sessions if requested by surrogates. This will also be&#xD;
      documented in the source documents by study staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects that receive any music sessions during mechanical ventilation will be approached&#xD;
      after their discharge from the ICU and before discharge from the hospital. At this point in&#xD;
      the study, subjects will be asked to sign the consent form themselves, indicating that they&#xD;
      agree to continue with the study and complete the questionnaires. The Mini Mental Status Exam&#xD;
      will be done to assess capacity to complete the ICU Stressful Experiences Questionnaire. A&#xD;
      score of 25 or higher will be used as a marker to determine if a subject will be administered&#xD;
      the questionnaire as was done in the prior study. If potential candidates are deemed to have&#xD;
      capacity they will be administered the 32-item, previously validated, ICU Stressful&#xD;
      Experiences Questionnaire with the addition of a few questions specific to their recall and&#xD;
      experience with the music while critically ill. If a subject receives music sessions, but is&#xD;
      not able to provide consent for the questionnaires (due to clinical limitations or hospital&#xD;
      discharge) they will not be excluded from the study. A limited data set will be utilized for&#xD;
      these subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the questionnaire has been administered, medical record data will be abstracted from&#xD;
      the chart.&#xD;
