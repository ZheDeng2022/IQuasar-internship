      Background: Owing to controversial staging and classification of adenocarcinoma of the&#xD;
      oesophagogastric junction (AOG) before surgery, the choice of appropriate surgical approach&#xD;
      remains problematic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a retrospective study, preoperative staging of AOG and the impact of preoperative&#xD;
      misclassification on outcome were analysed. Methods: Data from patients with AOG were&#xD;
      analysed from a prospectively collected database with regard to surgical treatment,&#xD;
      preoperative and postoperative staging, and outcome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective database of all patients with surgically resectable esophageal, cardia and&#xD;
      gastric carcinomas was established in 1992 at the Department for General, Visceral and&#xD;
      Thoracic Surgery at the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf, Germany. Only patients without&#xD;
      neoadjuvant therapy and histologically proven AEG type I and II were included into this&#xD;
      study. The demographic, clinical, operative and postoperative courses of each patient were&#xD;
      collected. Informed consent was obtained from all patients before including them in the&#xD;
      prospective database which was approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of the chamber of&#xD;
      physicians of Hamburg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative examinations of patients included physical examination, routine blood tests,&#xD;
      plain chest radiography, abdominal ultrasonography, endoscopy, endosonography (EUS), computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT) of the chest and abdomen as well as positron emission tomography (PET)-CT&#xD;
      after January 2006 and studies of tumor markers (CEA, CA 19-9), in selected patients. Tumour&#xD;
      localization was defined according the Siewert classification (3) based upon endoscopy,&#xD;
      endosonography and intraoperative assessment of the respective surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients undergoing a thoracoabdominal esophagectomy (TA) were operated with a&#xD;
      right-sided thoracotomy, and a median inverse T-shaped laparotomy. Peritumoral resection&#xD;
      included an en bloc subtotal esophageal resection with dissection of the right-sided&#xD;
      paratracheal, aortopulmonary window, subcarinal and mediastinal lymph nodes (LN) and the&#xD;
      azygos vein and a collar or high intrathoracically anastomosis. An extensive lymphadenectomy&#xD;
      of the upper abdominal compartment (D-II lymphadenectomy, including the paracardial, the left&#xD;
      gastric artery nodes along with the LN of the lesser and greater curvature of the stomach,&#xD;
      the prepyloric LN, the celiac trunk, the common hepatic artery, the LN in the hepathoduodenal&#xD;
      ligament and the LN at the splenic artery) was conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The transhiatal esophagectomy (TH) consisted of an inversed T-shaped laparotomy, a wide&#xD;
      peritumoral dissection of the distal esophagus, DII lymphadenectomy and a dissection of the&#xD;
      LN of the posterior mediastinum extending as far as the carina of the trachea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extended gastrectomy (EG) consisted of an inversed T-shaped laparotomy, a gastrectomy with&#xD;
      resection of the distal esophagus, D-II lymphadenectomy plus dissection of the lower&#xD;
      posterior mediastinum LN. The reconstruction included a jejunal loop with a J-pouch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histopathological analyses were performed by a senior specialist in gastrointestinal&#xD;
      pathology. All removed LN were counted, identified according to their location and assessed&#xD;
      separately. Standard histopathologic analysis of paraffin-embedded LN was performed by serial&#xD;
      sections of 5 µm thickness and staining with hematoxylin-eosin and van Gieson.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The histopathological report including tumour type, stage and grade was determined according&#xD;
      to the 7th edition of the TNM classification (8, 12). The percentage of positive lymph nodes&#xD;
      in regard to excised lymph nodes was classified according the definition of Bogoevski et al.&#xD;
      (13).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative follow-up was conducted at three months intervals for the first two years and&#xD;
      at six-month intervals thereafter, and included physical examination, plain chest&#xD;
      radiography, abdominal ultrasonography, endoscopy, endosonography, computed tomography of the&#xD;
      chest and abdomen as well as PET-CT after January 2006 in selected patients. Further, studies&#xD;
      of tumor markers (carcinoembryonic antigen and CA 19-9), and bone scanning were performed.&#xD;
      Recurrence was diagnosed if proven by biopsy or unequivocal evidence of tumour masses with a&#xD;
      tendency to grow during further follow-up and/or follow-up until death. Events considered&#xD;
      were death, local recurrence, and distant metastasis. When no events were recorded, the&#xD;
      patients were censored for the statistical evaluation at the last contact. Overall survival,&#xD;
      defined as time from operation to death or last follow-up, and local recurrence-free&#xD;
      survival, defined as time from operation to time of diagnosis of local tumour recurrence,&#xD;
      were calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis SPSS 17.0 for Windows was used for statistical analysis. Associations&#xD;
      between categorical variables were assessed by χ2 test. The Mann-Whithney U and&#xD;
      Kruskal-Wallis tests were used for analysis of continuous variables. The Kaplan-Meier method&#xD;
      was used to analyse recurrence and death. Differences between patient groups were assessed&#xD;
      using log-rank tests. Apart from patient's sex and age at surgery, those co-variates with a&#xD;
      p-value &lt;0.05 in univariable survival analysis (log rank test) were entered into&#xD;
      multivariable Cox proportional-hazards analysis to assess the independent influence of these&#xD;
      co-variates and shown as hazard ratio (HR) and 95 per cent c.i.. Because this analysis was&#xD;
      intended to be explorative, no adjustment for multiple testing was carried out. Differences&#xD;
      were considered to be statistically significant at P&lt;0.05.&#xD;
