    <textblock>
      This retrospective cohort study will assess the association of benign prostatic hyperplasia&#xD;
      (BPH) treatment (5-alpha reductase inhibitors (5ARI) and alpha-blocker medications) with the&#xD;
      occurrence of prostate cancer related mortality. This study will also assess a number of&#xD;
      secondary endpoints including prostate cancer mortality or metastatic prostate cancer, and&#xD;
      all cause mortality.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A retrospective cohort study from 1992-2010 will be conducted using data from 4 Kaiser sites:&#xD;
      Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC), Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC),&#xD;
      Kaiser Permanente Northwest (KPNW), and Kaiser Permanente Colorado (KPCO). Men treated with&#xD;
      BPH medications, 5ARIs (with and without concomitant and/or previous alpha-blocker use) will&#xD;
      be compared to men treated with alpha-blockers. A matched design will be used with each man&#xD;
      treated with 5ARIs being matched with 5 or 6 men treated with alpha-blockers. Men 50 years or&#xD;
      older at the time of their first prescription for a study defined BPH medication, initiating&#xD;
      treatment between 1992 and 2008 with at least 1-year of coverage in the healthcare system&#xD;
      before the first prescription for BPH medication and at least 3 consecutive prescriptions (90&#xD;
      days of supply) for a BPH medication will be eligible for inclusion in the study. Men with a&#xD;
      diagnosis of prostate cancer any time before the first prescription for BPH medication,&#xD;
      having a diagnosis of prostate cancer within 3 months after initiation of their first BPH&#xD;
      medication, and those treated with finasteride 1mg prior to their BPH medication will be&#xD;
      excluded from the study. 5ARI initiators will be matched to alpha-blocker users in a ratio of&#xD;
      1:5 or 1:6 to yield an overall matching ratio of 1:5.4. Matching factors include age (+/- 1&#xD;
      year), timing of BPH treatment initiation (+/- 1 year), race, and duration of prior use of&#xD;
      alpha-blockers. Based on the feasibility study from KPSC, there will be approximately 284,000&#xD;
      men treated with BPH medications meeting eligibility criteria for inclusion in the study&#xD;
      sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be analyzed using Kaplan Meier curves comparing the 5ARI vs alpha-blocker users&#xD;
      for the primary and secondary study outcomes, without any adjustments. Additionally, a plot&#xD;
      of cumulative incidence, adjusting for competing risks of death, will be constructed allowing&#xD;
      for the investigation of the effect of competing risks on the Kaplan-Meier probability&#xD;
      estimates. Crude mortality rates and incidence rates of metastatic cancer will be calculated.&#xD;
      Cox proportional hazard regression models will be fit to compare the primary and secondary&#xD;
      outcomes between groups using hazard ratios, while adjusting for pre-treatment&#xD;
      characteristics.&#xD;

        All men age 50 years and older treated with a BPH medication (5ARI and/or alpha-blocker)&#xD;
        will be eligible for inclusion. Participants are not required to have a BPH diagnosis at&#xD;
        the time of their first 5ARI or alpha-blocker prescription as based upon data from the&#xD;
        feasibility report approximately half of all men received their first recorded BPH&#xD;
        diagnosis after initiating treatment. Furthermore, approximately 25% of participants&#xD;
        treated with 5ARIs or alpha-blockers did not have a diagnosis code for BPH in their medical&#xD;
        record. BPH diagnosis codes were not used in a consistent way historically in the Kaiser&#xD;
        data. Men should have coverage within the healthcare system for at least 1-year before the&#xD;
        first BPH medication prescription. Men with a history of prostate cancer or who develop&#xD;
        prostate cancer within &lt;3 months of starting their first BPH medication are not eligible&#xD;
        for inclusion.&#xD;
