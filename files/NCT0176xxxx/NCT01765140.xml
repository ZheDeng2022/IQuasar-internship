  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol has provided 3,4 diaminopyridine (DAP) under a treatment-use IND to patients&#xD;
      with congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS). It is currently closed to enrollment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CMS diagnoses are made based on clinical, electromyographic and molecular genetic findings,&#xD;
      and all patients have been referred to the PI for DAP treatment. This study enrolled minors&#xD;
      and adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CMS patients under age 18 years were included if their parent or guardian gave written&#xD;
      permission. Minors who turn 18 while in the program will be re-consented as adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose of DAP is determined individually for each patient. Adults are started with a dose&#xD;
      of 10 mg 3-4 times daily, increased over several weeks to the dose that produces the maximum&#xD;
      symptomatic response, not to exceed 100 mg daily. Pyridostigmine bromide (PB) may be added at&#xD;
      low doses and increased to the dose that produced the best response, not to exceed 360 mg&#xD;
      daily. In children, equivalent doses of these medications is calculated on a surface area&#xD;
      basis. The doses of DAP and PB are periodically adjusted to assure that the smallest&#xD;
      effective doses are used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who achieve significant clinical benefit from DAP, as judged by the study PI and the&#xD;
      patient, may continue taking DAP as long as the drug is available from the sponsor, and as&#xD;
      long as they return for regular follow-up evaluations at the Duke MG Clinic. Patients who are&#xD;
      unable to return for regular follow-up will be required to have their local physician obtain&#xD;
      DAP for them from the sponsor.&#xD;
