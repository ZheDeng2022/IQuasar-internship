      The aim of the investigators' study is to evaluate biochemical, immunological and&#xD;
      histological characteristics of patients affected with the so-called &quot;gluten (or wheat)&#xD;
      sensitivity&quot; who suffers from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-like symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As it is not known what component of the cereals causes the symptoms in so called&#xD;
      &quot;gluten-sensitive&quot; patients, the investigators prefer to speak of &quot;not-celiac wheat&#xD;
      sensitivity&quot; (NCWS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      NCWS patients may be defined as ones, neither celiac or allergic to wheat, who develop&#xD;
      symptoms following wheat consumption, that improved on wheat/gluten free diet (GFD). For our&#xD;
      research, we will select adult patients, both genders, affected with suspected NCWS (i.e.&#xD;
      with symptoms/signs which disappeared on GFD and worsen on a gluten containing diet, testing&#xD;
      negative for celiac disease [anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies, anti-tTG, and&#xD;
      anti-endomysium antibodies, EMA, and with biopsy Marsh 0-1] and wheat allergy [serum specific&#xD;
      IgE for wheat]). The patients will be recruited at the Department of Internal Medicine,&#xD;
      'Giovanni Paolo II' Hospital of Sciacca (Agrigento), and of Internal Medicine of the&#xD;
      University of Palermo, from January 2012 to October 2013, for IBS-like symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of the recruitment, the patients will be on GFD by at least one month and must be&#xD;
      asymptomatic. A more restricted elimination diet (with the exclusion of cow's milk, egg and&#xD;
      other foods) could be prescribed in patients who are suspected to suffer from multiple food&#xD;
      hypersensitivity. The patients will be randomized to undergo a double-blind&#xD;
      placebo-controlled study, assuming wheat flour or placebo, administered daily for 15 days.&#xD;
      Before and after the challenge, the investigators will evaluate gastrointestinal&#xD;
      (Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale, GSRS) and the investigators will collect blood and&#xD;
      fecal sampling and biopsies from endoscopic evaluation (both esophagogastroduodenoscopy and&#xD;
      rectoscopy, with multiple biopsies), for the identification of possible markers (serological,&#xD;
      biochemical, immunological, histological features, expression of cytokines and other&#xD;
      constitutive mucosal proteins from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, mucosal lymphocytes&#xD;
      and fecal biomarkers) that may be of help to diagnose the condition of NCWS and to understand&#xD;
      its pathogenesis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Gluten is the most important protein component of some grains, notably wheat, rye, and&#xD;
      barley, which are the basis for a variety of wheat-derived alimentary products consumed&#xD;
      throughout the world (bread, pasta, pizza etc). However the &quot;engineering&quot; of&#xD;
      gluten-containing grains created the conditions for human diseases related to gluten&#xD;
      exposure. These forms of gluten intolerance represent a heterogeneous set of conditions,&#xD;
      including celiac disease, wheat allergy and gluten sensitivity (GS), that, combined, seems to&#xD;
      affect about 10% of the general population. The frequency of not-celiac GS is however still&#xD;
      unknown, even though it is possible that this condition have been undiagnosed and&#xD;
      under-diagnosed by the physicians for a long time. The immune responsiveness to wheat&#xD;
      antigens represents a complex process, and its establishment and maintenance are not&#xD;
      completely elucidated. The most frequent diseases caused by wheat ingestion are T&#xD;
      cell-mediated disorders, i.e. celiac disease and IgE-mediated allergic reactions. However,&#xD;
      besides celiac disease and wheat allergy, there are cases of gluten reactions in which&#xD;
      neither autoimmune nor IgE-mediated allergic mechanisms are involved. These are generally&#xD;
      defined as GS. Some subjects, who experience symptoms when eating gluten-containing products&#xD;
      and show improvement when following a gluten-free diet (GFD), may have GS instead of celiac&#xD;
      disease or wheat allergy. GS patients are unable to tolerate gluten and develop an adverse&#xD;
      reaction when eating gluten, that, usually, and differently from celiac disease, does not&#xD;
      lead to small intestinal damage. Gastrointestinal symptoms in GS patients may resemble those&#xD;
      associated with celiac disease, but the overall clinical picture is generally less severe and&#xD;
      is not accompanied by the occurrence of autoantibodies (i.e. anti-tTG or EMA) or autoimmune&#xD;
      disease (i.e. Hashimoto's thyroiditis). Typically, the diagnosis is made by exclusion, and an&#xD;
      elimination diet and an &quot;open challenge&quot; (i.e., the monitored reintroduction of&#xD;
      gluten-containing foods) are most often used to evaluate whether health improves or worsen&#xD;
      with the elimination or reintroduction of gluten in the diet, respectively.&#xD;
      Gluten-sensitivity can cause both gastrointestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms; among the&#xD;
      former, the most frequent are IBS-like symptoms including abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea,&#xD;
      constipation and alternate bowel habit. However, as it is not known what component of the&#xD;
      cereals causes the symptoms in so called &quot;gluten-sensitive&quot; patients, we prefer to speak of&#xD;
      &quot;Not-celiac wheat sensitivity&quot; (NCWS). Furthermore, in our experience, NCWS patients can&#xD;
      suffer from multiple food hypersensitivity and need of a more restricted diet with the&#xD;
      elimination of cow's milk, egg and other foods, in addition to wheat. For these reasons,&#xD;
      before to undergo the gluten challenge, the patients will undergo an oligoantigenic diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has two major aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluation of the effective dependence from the wheat of the IBS-like manifestations&#xD;
           presented by subjects with suspected NCWS. The study will be done after a period of GFD,&#xD;
           comparing two groups of suspected NCWS subjects: administering wheat flour or placebo&#xD;
           (for 15 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Identification of possible markers (serological, biochemical, immunological,&#xD;
           histological features, expression of cytokines and other constitutive mucosal proteins&#xD;
           from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, mucosal lymphocytes and fecal biomarkers) that&#xD;
           may be of help to diagnose the condition of NCWS. In particular, the investigators will&#xD;
           search for markers of NCWS in the colon mucosa of the patients with IBS-like symptoms.&#xD;
