      Drug eluting balloons (DEB) have been developed to overcome the limitations of drug eluting&#xD;
      stent (DES), but clinical results of different studies about DEB are not consistent. Thus, we&#xD;
      performed a meta-analysis to compare outcomes of DEB and DES in coronary artery disease&#xD;
      (CAD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The meta-analysis was performed according to the recommended methods [14-15]. A systematic&#xD;
      search for eligible studies involved MEDLINE, CENTRAL, Embase, Highwire Press, Scopus and&#xD;
      Google Scholar databases and was conducted without language restriction by two independent&#xD;
      investigators (A.L. and A.R.), using the following keywords: &quot;drug&quot;, &quot;eluting&quot; &quot;balloon(s)&quot;,&#xD;
      &quot;DEB&quot;, &quot;coronary&quot;, &quot;angioplasty&quot;. Divergences were resolved by consensus. Endnote software v.&#xD;
      10 was used to build up libraries of results that were combined after erasing duplicates. The&#xD;
      references of retrieved studies were searched manually for additional trials, and efforts to&#xD;
      contact authors were performed to obtain further study details or additional references. The&#xD;
      search is updated to December 2012.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection criteria: citations were screened at title and abstract level and retrieved as full&#xD;
      reports.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inclusion criteria were: 1) randomized studies or cohort studies reporting a comparison&#xD;
           between a DEB treated group and a DES treated group; 2) availability of reports of late&#xD;
           lumen loss (LLL) and/or overall death and/or myocardial infarction (MI) and/or stent&#xD;
           thrombosis (ST) and/or target lesion revascularization (TLR).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exclusion criteria were: 1) duplicate reporting (in which case the manuscript reporting&#xD;
           the largest sample or the longest follow-up was selected), 2) follow up of at least 6&#xD;
           months; 3) studies presenting composite major adverse cardiac events (MACE) without&#xD;
           mentioning individual end points. Data were abstracted on pre-specified forms by 2&#xD;
           unblinded reviewers; divergences were resolved by consensus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Internal validity : the present meta-analysis was performed according to the Guidelines for&#xD;
      randomized controlled trials of the Cochrane Collaboration and for non randomized studies in&#xD;
      compliance with the Guidelines of the MOOSE group. Quality of included studies was appraised&#xD;
      by 2 unblinded investigators. The risk of selection, performance, detection, and attrition&#xD;
      bias (expressed as low risk of bias [A], moderate risk of bias [B], high risk of bias [C], or&#xD;
      incomplete reporting leading to inability to ensure the underlying risk of bias [D]) were&#xD;
      evaluated separately, as recommended. Non-randomized studies were evaluated using the&#xD;
      Newcastle-Ottawa Scale a validated technique in assessing the quality of non-randomized&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis and synthesis: Odds ratios (ORs) were computed from individual studies and&#xD;
      pooled according to a fixed effect (e.g. inverse variance weighting) or random effect model&#xD;
      in case of statistical heterogeneity. Two separate subgroup analysis were pre-specified: 1)&#xD;
      exclusion of studies with small vessel and bifurcation PCI; 2) exclusion of non-randomized&#xD;
      studies 3) exclusion of studies in which DEBs were not used together with BMS deployment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results will be presented as overall meta-analysis and subgroups meta-analyses for DEB vs DES&#xD;
      comparisons. Outcomes appraised were in-stent LLL, overall death, MI, ST and TLR. We used the&#xD;
      Mantel-Haenszel method for combining ORs, a validated method to pool the data in a&#xD;
      meta-analysis of binary outcomes. For the in-stent LLL outcome, the mean difference of&#xD;
      6-month LLL compared with baseline was used and the overall weighted mean difference (WMD)&#xD;
      was built with the inverse variance method. Heterogeneity was assessed by Cochran's Q test,&#xD;
      with 2-tailed p=0.1. Statistical inconsistency test (I2) was also employed to overcome the&#xD;
      low statistical power of Cochran's Q test. The potential publication bias was examined by&#xD;
      constructing a &quot;funnel plot&quot;, in which sample size was plotted against odds ratios. In&#xD;
      addition, a mathematical estimate of the asymmetry of this plot was provided by a linear&#xD;
      regression approach. Asymmetry was considered to be present if the intercept of the&#xD;
      regression line did deviate significantly from zero. To explore and mitigate heterogeneity,&#xD;
      pre-specified covariates (prevalence of diabetes in the study population and reference&#xD;
      coronary vessel diameter) as potential confounders were considered in the meta-regression&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pooling of data, subgroup analyses and publication bias tests were performed with Review&#xD;
      Manager 5.1 (The Nordic Cochrane Center, KÃ¸behvn, Denmark) and StatsDirect v 2.7.8&#xD;
      (StatsDirect Ltd, Cheshire WA, UK). Meta-regression analyses were builded with Comprehensive&#xD;
      Meta-analysis Version 2 (Biostat, Englewood, New Jersey, United States).&#xD;
