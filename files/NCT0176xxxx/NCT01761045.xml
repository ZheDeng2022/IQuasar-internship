  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to confirm that Monosodium L-Glutamate (MSG) supplementation,&#xD;
      both alone or in combination with Nucleic Acid (IMP), enhances satiety and decreases food&#xD;
      intakes at the next meal in healthy female adults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over clinical trial. A&#xD;
      total of 80 women aged 30 to 45 y will be randomized to a sequence of test product&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be required to meet several inclusion and exclusion criteria, which will be&#xD;
      assessed at the screening visit, including a general screening questionnaire,&#xD;
      medical/medication history, eating disorder questionnaire, eating inventory questionnaire,&#xD;
      dietary inventory questionnaire, and anthropometric and vital sign measurements. At the&#xD;
      screening visit, a urine sample will be collected for drug and alcohol screening, cotinine&#xD;
      level, and pregnancy. Alcohol breath test will be performed as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After assessment of the eligibility criteria, qualified subjects will be invited to&#xD;
      participate in the study. This study will take approximately 3 weeks to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will return to the study site within 28 days after the screening visit for testing&#xD;
      period 1, followed by 2 additional visits (testing period 2 and 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will consume 1 of 3 treatments, based on randomization sequence at each test period&#xD;
      visit: Consommé soup with Monosodium L-Glutamate (MSG), Consommé soup with MSG and Nucleic&#xD;
      Acid (IMP), and Placebo soup with no MSG or IMP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When subjects arrive at the research center at approximately 11:30am, admission procedures&#xD;
      will be conducted: an alcohol breath test, food and activity diary review, and vital signs&#xD;
      and weight will be measured. If vital sign measurements are elevated, subjects will be&#xD;
      rescheduled within 2-3 days. Right before serving the standard lunch meal, subjects will be&#xD;
      asked to complete a satiety motivational questionnaire. Subjects will consume the entire&#xD;
      standard lunch meal and water within 30 min. Immediately after eating the standard lunch&#xD;
      meal, subjects will complete the satiety motivational questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two hours after the standard lunch meal, subjects will be given one of the test soups (based&#xD;
      on their randomization) to consume in its entirety, followed by completion of the satiety&#xD;
      motivational questionnaire and the soup rating questionnaire. Fifteen minutes from test soup&#xD;
      administration, snacks and water (ad lib) will be provided and subjects will be instructed to&#xD;
      eat as much as or as little as they desire, followed by completing the satiety motivational&#xD;
      questionnaire. At 3 h 15 min and at 4 h, subjects will complete the satiety motivational&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test periods 2 and 3 will be scheduled between 3-14 days after completing test period visit&#xD;
      1: all procedures are identical on each test period visit with the exception of the test&#xD;
      treatment soup consumed by subjects.&#xD;
