  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gene and cell therapies have a real value potential (example: potential long-term effect,&#xD;
      curative potential, and single administration) but also drawbacks (example: treatment&#xD;
      perceived as complex and risky generating fear and anxiety in subjects and their family; high&#xD;
      cost) that require significant educational efforts and planning for optimal market access. It&#xD;
      is therefore important to understand subject and physician perceptions of T-Cell Receptor&#xD;
      (TCR) therapies. The aim of this study is to collect qualitative data from a small but&#xD;
      diverse sample of oncologists and subjects in the United States to gather qualitative&#xD;
      evidence for a preliminary understanding about their perceptions of T-cell therapies in the&#xD;
      treatment of cancer. This cross-sectional study will involve up to 20 adult subjects with&#xD;
      cancer and up to 20 oncologists/hematologist-oncologists in the United States. Eligible&#xD;
      subjects will be scheduled for a telephone interview lasting approximately 60-90 minutes.&#xD;
      Eligible oncologists will be scheduled for a telephone interview lasting approximately 60&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Searching social media is another way of understanding the perceptions of prescribers and&#xD;
      consumers of CGT, in addition to interviews being conducted under the original protocol. The&#xD;
      results of a feasibility assessment suggested that it would be helpful to explore social&#xD;
      media to add to the findings from the interviews. This social media study(SMS) is being&#xD;
      conducted as a pilot study to hone methods for future explorations of social media. The pilot&#xD;
      study will investigate and describe initial themes emerging from existing discussions related&#xD;
      to CGT. Findings from this work will help GlaxoSmithKline to plan future work in the social&#xD;
      media landscape.&#xD;
