    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to test the efficacy of repetitive Transcranial Magnetic&#xD;
      Stimulation (rTMS) as a treatment for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Participants will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: Group 1: Active Dorsolateral Prefrontal&#xD;
      Cortex (DLPFC) rTMS; Group 2: Active Lateral Parietal Cortex (LPC) rTMS; and Group 3:&#xD;
      Inactive rTMS (Placebo) control (evenly split between each coil location). Participation in&#xD;
      the study takes approximately 7 Â½ months-including a 2-to 4-week treatment phase (20 rTMS&#xD;
      sessions) and a 6-month follow-up phase.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to test the efficacy of a non-pharmacological treatment for MCI that involves&#xD;
      noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS). Early studies in Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia&#xD;
      patients have found that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS, a form of NIBS)&#xD;
      improved global cognitive function and activities of daily living. Given that in AD, neuronal&#xD;
      loss and synaptic dysfunction progress along brain networks, the results of these early&#xD;
      studies of brain stimulation suggest there is sufficient neuroplasticity in AD for&#xD;
      efficacious effects of brain stimulation. Of the very few rTMS studies in MCI that have been&#xD;
      published, the effect size appears to be moderately large. However, it is not clear whether&#xD;
      the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), the stimulation site used in the most of the&#xD;
      prior MCI/AD rTMS trials, is the optimal site for achieving the most efficacious effects&#xD;
      including effects on episodic memory. Importantly, when other investigators used rTMS to&#xD;
      stimulate a lateral parietal cortical (LPC) site in healthy young adults, significant effects&#xD;
      of rTMS on memory were measureable weeks later. Moreover, functional connectivity of brain&#xD;
      regions was selectively increased, including the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), a &quot;hub&quot; of&#xD;
      brain networks that is affected in amnestic MCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because stimulation of the DLPFC and the LPC may each have distinct effects, we designed this&#xD;
      pilot trial to have two active rTMS treatment groups: DLPFC and LPC. A third group will&#xD;
      receive inactive (placebo) rTMS to achieve a controlled, randomized, double-blind trial. For&#xD;
      each of the three groups, stimulation will be bilateral, based on effects achieved in the AD&#xD;
      studies. The primary hypothesis is that active rTMS (to either site of stimulation) will be&#xD;
      superior to inactive (placebo) rTMS in improving memory. Measures of change in functional&#xD;
      connectivity will be computed to examine whether there is evidence that rTMS changes&#xD;
      connectivity of the PCC with other regions of the brain. In addition to looking at effects of&#xD;
      rTMS on functional connectivity and cognition in relation to the cortical site stimulated,&#xD;
      genetic markers will be collected toward addressing heterogeneity of response. To track the&#xD;
      durability of rTMS effects on memory, participants will be followed longer than in any prior&#xD;
      study (up to 6 months after the intervention). If this study finds rTMS improves memory in&#xD;
      older adults with MCI, further clinical development of this non-pharmacological treatment&#xD;
      could ultimately improve the lives of millions of older adults who have MCI and are at an&#xD;
      increased risk of developing dementia.&#xD;
