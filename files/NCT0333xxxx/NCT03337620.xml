  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double blind placebo-controlled study which will evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
      bupivacaine compared to saline, delivered by the Tx360® device to the sphenopalatine ganglion&#xD;
      (SPG), to treat chronic migraine headache. The Tx360® is a nasal applicator which is cleared&#xD;
      through the FDA for transnasal medication delivery, including delivery to the SPG. The SPG&#xD;
      has been implicated in a variety of cephalalgias. It is critical to the success of this&#xD;
      intervention that the blocking agent be accurately delivered to this area as it is the only&#xD;
      non-bony access to the pterygopalatine fossa (PPF). Subjects meeting inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
      criteria will receive 12 intranasal treatments to the SPG over a period of 4 weeks with&#xD;
      follow-up monthly for an additional 3 months post-treatment.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase III, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, prospective,&#xD;
      clinical trial examining the outcomes of subjects with chronic migraine headache who are&#xD;
      treated with 0.3cc of 0.5% bupivacaine bilaterally vs 0.3cc of sterile water bilaterally,&#xD;
      each delivered to the mucosal surface of the SPG through each nare with the Tx360® device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects must have a current history of ICHD-III beta migraine with &gt; 14 headache days per&#xD;
      month (with 8 or more being migraine) in the 3 months prior to the screening visit. Subjects&#xD;
      will be required to have a stable history of doses of migraine prophylactic medication for at&#xD;
      least 30 days prior to the start of the 28-day screening/baseline phase and for the duration&#xD;
      of the study. At Visit 1, the subject will sign the informed consent indicating they are&#xD;
      willing to participate in the study. Initially, subjects who meet the study criteria will&#xD;
      participate in a 28-day screening/baseline phase. During the 28-day screening/baseline phase,&#xD;
      all subjects will be monitored through the use of electronic Daily Headache Diary (DHD) to&#xD;
      ensure they continue to meet all inclusion criteria, and none of the exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If baseline criteria have been met at the end of the 28-day screening/baseline phase, the&#xD;
      subject will return to the clinic for Visit 2 to be randomized into one of the two treatment&#xD;
      groups and begin the 4-week treatment phase of the study. Subjects who meet all inclusion&#xD;
      criteria, and none of the exclusion criteria, will be assigned to a treatment group based on&#xD;
      a computerized randomization number produced by a computer software system. One hundred and&#xD;
      eighty subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive 0.3cc of 0.5% bupivacaine bilaterally or&#xD;
      0.3cc of sterile water bilaterally. One member of the staff will allocate study medication,&#xD;
      based on the randomization plan, in a blinded fashion to subject, coordinator, and&#xD;
      investigator. At Visit 2, the subject will receive the first treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will return to the clinic three times per week for treatments, totaling 12&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At visit 13, subjects will receive the last treatment and will be transitioned into the&#xD;
      post-treatment phase of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will be followed for an additional 3 months during the post-treatment phase for a&#xD;
      total of 20 weeks participation in the study. During this post-treatment phase, the subject&#xD;
      will maintain the DHD at an 80% participation rate and two monthly phone visits will take&#xD;
      place 1 and 2 months post treatment respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will complete the study at Visit 14 to the clinic for final follow-up.&#xD;

    <masking_description>The subject, investigator, study coordinator, and additional study staff will remain blinded. One member of the staff will assign subjects to a treatment group based on a computerized randomization number produced by a computer software system. The number will correspond to a kit number, of which the staff member will then use to prepare the Tx360® device for each of the subject's treatments during the 4-week treatment phase. If the clinical site has a pharmacy, it is preferred that the pharmacy receive the study medication and Tx360® devices, maintain custody of the study medication and Tx360® devices during the study, and prepared the medication in Tx360® devices for each subject's treatment, according to the computer-generated randomization. In order to maintain subject-blinding during the active phase of the study, subjects will be given a piece of lemon candy prior to each procedure as a taste distractor</masking_description>
