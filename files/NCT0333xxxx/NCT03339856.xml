      Selective retina therapy (SRT) selectively disrupts the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) with&#xD;
      minimal damage to the photoreceptors. Previous studies have shown SRT to be effective for&#xD;
      resolving SRF, while causing only minimal collateral damage to the retina and vision.However,&#xD;
      most patients included in prior studies had chronic CSC (≥3 months symptom duration) and SRT&#xD;
      efficacy on acute CSC is not fully known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study evaluated short-term treatment outcomes following SRT with real-time&#xD;
      feedback-controlled dosimetry in Korean patients with acute idiopathic CSC.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) is a disorder that is characterized by a localized&#xD;
      serous detachment of the neurosensory retina in the posterior pole. Additionally, CSC is&#xD;
      often self-limiting and spontaneous resolution of subretinal fluid (SRF) often occurs within&#xD;
      several months. Although several treatment modalities (e.g., laser photocoagulation,&#xD;
      photodynamic therapy, and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF] therapy have been&#xD;
      used in CSC patients, a consensus has not yet been reached on the optimal time for&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selective retina therapy (SRT) selectively disrupts the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) with&#xD;
      minimal damage to the photoreceptors. Previous studies have shown SRT to be effective for&#xD;
      resolving SRF, while causing only minimal collateral damage to the retina and vision.&#xD;
      However, most patients included in prior studies had chronic CSC (≥3 months symptom duration)&#xD;
      and SRT efficacy on acute CSC is not fully known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When treating CSC patients, it is generally recommended to follow-up several months without&#xD;
      any intervention to identify spontaneous resolution of SRF. However, prompt treatment may be&#xD;
      beneficial for some patients. For example, metamorphopsia or micropsia associated with CSC&#xD;
      can greatly interfere with driving or with work when an occupation requires delicate&#xD;
      procedures. Additionally, patients are often psychologically distressed by a CSC diagnosis&#xD;
      and the accompanying decrease in vision-related quality of life. In these cases, prompt&#xD;
      treatment to reduce SRF may relieve, at least in part, CSC symptoms and their related stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study evaluated short-term treatment outcomes following SRT with real-time&#xD;
      feedback-controlled dosimetry in Korean patients with acute idiopathic CSC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study included patients who were diagnosed with treatment-naïve idiopathic CSC and were&#xD;
      treated with SRT. The R:GEN device (Lutronic, Goyang-si, South Korea) was used to administer&#xD;
      SRT. Inclusion criteria also included SRF involving the fovea (documented by optical&#xD;
      coherence tomography [OCT] performed at initial presentation) and symptom duration shorter&#xD;
      than 3 months. Patients were excluded from analyses if any of the following were true: (1)&#xD;
      age &gt; 55 years, (2) clinical or angiographic features suggestive of choroidal&#xD;
      neovascularization, (3) OCT findings suggestive of type 1 neovascularization or polypoidal&#xD;
      choroidal vasculopathy (e.g., double layer sign or fibrovascular pigment epithelial&#xD;
      detachment), (4) history of macular laser photocoagulation, photodynamic therapy, or&#xD;
      anti-VEGF therapy, or (5) history of exogenous corticosteroid treatment for a systemic&#xD;
      disease (e.g., Cushing's syndrome or renal disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examination, treatment, and follow-up All subjects underwent comprehensive ophthalmologic&#xD;
      examinations, including best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) measurement, slit-lamp&#xD;
      biomicroscopy (90-diopter lens), fluorescein angiography (FAG), fundus photography, and&#xD;
      spectral domain OCT (Spectralis HRA-OCT™, Heidelberg Engineering, Dossenheim, Germany or RS&#xD;
      3000™, Nidek Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Indocyanine green angiography using a confocal&#xD;
      laser-scanning system (Spectralis HRA-OCT™) was performed at the discretion of each&#xD;
      physician. A CSC diagnosis was based on FAG findings, in particular, evidence of a typical&#xD;
      ink blot or smokestack leakage. A single examiner (J.H.K.) reviewed all FAG results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All SRT was performed by a single physician (J.H.K.) using a Nd:YLF laser (wavelength of 257&#xD;
      nm, 15 micro pulses per spot, single micro pulse duration of 1.7 µs, pulse repetition rate of&#xD;
      100 Hz). Spot size was set at a diameter of 200 µm. Real-time feedback-controlled dosimetry&#xD;
      (RFD) detects ultrasonic pressure waves generated by intracellular bubble formation and was&#xD;
      used to determine optimal laser energy. Before applying laser energy to a leakage point, test&#xD;
      shots were made immediately outside of the superior or inferior temporal arcade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optimal laser energy was determined based on real-time feedback system indications on the&#xD;
      control panel. Laser energy began at 80 µJ and was increased in 5-10 µJ intervals until the&#xD;
      optimal energy delivery was confirmed by the RFD system. Following confirmation, the optimal&#xD;
      laser energy was applied to fluorescein leakages. If the energy was indeed optimal at leakage&#xD;
      points, laser shots were administered around the leakages. If the energy was not optimal at&#xD;
      the leakage points, laser energy was again increased in 5-10 µJ increments until optimal&#xD;
      energy delivery, as confirmed by the RFD system. If the control panel indicated that&#xD;
      excessive laser energy had been applied, the laser energy was decreased in 5-10 µJ increments&#xD;
      until the optimal energy delivery was again achieved (confirmed by RFD system). The total&#xD;
      number of laser shots delivered around fluorescein leakage points that were at or above the&#xD;
      optimal laser energy were counted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients had follow-up visits 1 and 3 months after SRT, at which BCVA was measured and OCT&#xD;
      examination was performed. Central foveal thickness (CFT) was manually measured on OCT images&#xD;
      and was defined as the distance between the RPE and the internal limiting membrane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures Both BCVA and CFT were measured at diagnosis, at 1 and 3 months following&#xD;
      SRT, and at the final follow-up visit. The incidence of complete SRF resolution was&#xD;
      estimated. Color fundus photographs taken at each follow-up visit also documented laser&#xD;
      treatment and were used to check for the presence of visible laser spots. All BCVA&#xD;
      measurements were converted to the logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) for&#xD;
      data analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses Statistical analyses were performed using a commercially available&#xD;
      software package (SPSS v. 12.0 for Windows; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Comparisons between BCVA&#xD;
      and CFT measurements at different time points were performed using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests&#xD;
      with a Bonferroni correction. Statistical significance was defined as P ≤ 0.05.&#xD;
