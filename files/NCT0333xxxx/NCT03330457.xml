  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, single center study in healthy volunteers dosed to steady&#xD;
      state with betrixaban, designed to (1) Determine an andexanet dosing regimen required to&#xD;
      reverse anticoagulant activity of betrixaban in healthy subjects, (2) Assess the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of andexanet vs. placebo (3) Determine the PK properties of andexanet and&#xD;
      betrixaban (4) Determine the PD properties of betrixaban before, during, and after receiving&#xD;
      andexanet or placebo and (5) Investigate the immunogenicity of andexanet in the presence of&#xD;
      betrixaban.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The subject is a healthy man or woman between the ages of 18 and 45 years old,&#xD;
             inclusive, who agrees to comply with the contraception and reproduction restrictions&#xD;
             of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
             Men must be using two acceptable methods of contraception, at least one of which must&#xD;
             be a barrier method (e.g., spermicidal gel plus condom) for the entire duration of the&#xD;
             study and for at least three months following last study drug administration, and&#xD;
             refrain from attempting to father a child or donating sperm in the three (3) months&#xD;
             following the last study drug administration. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar,&#xD;
             ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable&#xD;
             methods of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
             OR Men who report surgical sterilization (e.g., bilateral vasectomy) must have had the&#xD;
             procedure at least six (6) months prior to initial dosing. Surgical sterilization&#xD;
             procedures should be supported with clinical documentation and noted in the Relevant&#xD;
             Medical History/Current Medical Conditions section of the Case report forms (CRFs).&#xD;
&#xD;
             Women of childbearing potential must be using two medically acceptable methods of&#xD;
             contraception, at least one of which must be a barrier method, (e.g., intra-uterine&#xD;
             device plus condom, spermicidal gel plus condom, diaphragm plus condom, etc.), from&#xD;
             the time of screening and for the duration of the study, through at least three months&#xD;
             following last study drug administration. NOTE: Oral contraceptive use is not&#xD;
             permitted due to their increased risk of thromboembolism. Periodic abstinence (e.g.,&#xD;
             calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not&#xD;
             acceptable methods of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
             OR Postmenopausal women must have had no regular menstrual bleeding for at least one&#xD;
             (1) year prior to initial dosing. Menopause will be confirmed by an elevated plasma&#xD;
             Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level &gt; 40mIU/mL at screening for women not in&#xD;
             receipt of hormone replacement therapy (HRT); OR Women who report surgical&#xD;
             sterilization (i.e., hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy) must have had the&#xD;
             procedure at least six (6) months prior to initial dosing. Surgical sterilization&#xD;
             procedures should be supported with clinical documentation and noted in the Relevant&#xD;
             Medical History/Current Medical Conditions section of the CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;

             at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The subject has clinically unremarkable medical history, physical examination, ECG,&#xD;
             and vital signs, as determined by the Investigator. Laboratory values must also be&#xD;
             clinically unremarkable as determined by the Investigator, with the exception of the&#xD;
             following labs which must be strictly within the normal range:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Coagulation labs - PT, aPTT, ACT;&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Hematology lab - Hematocrit/Hemoglobin;&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Liver function labs - Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase&#xD;
                  (ALT) (may be below lower limit of normal [LLN], but not above upper limit of&#xD;
                  normal [ULN]).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The subject has a body mass index 19 to 30 kg/m2, inclusive, and weighs at least 60&#xD;
             kg.&#xD;

          4. The subject agrees to abstain from alcohol consumption for 48 hours prior to dosing&#xD;
             and for the duration of the in-house study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The subject smokes &lt;4 cigarettes/day (or equivalent: ≤0.5 can of chewing tobacco/week,&#xD;
             1 cigar/day) and agrees to abstain from smoking while domiciled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The subject is able to read and give written informed consent and has signed a consent&#xD;
             form approved by the Investigator's Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Ethics&#xD;

             products, in the 2 weeks prior to randomization. Furthermore, the subject agrees not&#xD;
             to take any such drugs throughout the study (if it becomes medically necessary to do&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. The subject has a history of major surgery, severe trauma or bone fracture within 3&#xD;
             months prior to dosing; or planned surgery within 1 month after dosing.&#xD;

&#xD;
         10. The subject has a medical or surgical condition which may impair drug absorption.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. The subject is allergic to any of the vehicle ingredients: tris, arginine,&#xD;

&#xD;
         13. The subject has any condition which could interfere with or for which the treatment&#xD;
             might interfere with the conduct of the study, or which would, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator increase the risk of the subject's participation in the study. This would&#xD;
             include, but is not limited to alcoholism, drug dependency or abuse, psychiatric&#xD;
             disease, epilepsy or any unexplained blackouts.&#xD;
