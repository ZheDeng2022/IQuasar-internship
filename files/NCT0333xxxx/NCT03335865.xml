    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of measuring urine oxygen tension in&#xD;
      cardiac surgery patient and the ability of peri-operative urine oxygen measurements to&#xD;
      predict post-operative acute kidney injury. The hypothesis is that a small oxymeter placed in&#xD;
      a urinary catheter will provide reliable measurement of urine oxygenation and that these&#xD;
      measurements will predict post-operative acute kidney injury in cardiac surgery patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is an unfortunately common complication of cardiac surgery that&#xD;
      occurs in up to 40% of patients and results in increased mortality, prolonged ICU and&#xD;
      hospital length of stay. AKI after cardiac surgery is not a benign complication, increasing&#xD;
      mortality from 1% to 19% in those with AKI and to 63% mortality in those who required renal&#xD;
      replacement therapy (RRT). In another study, patients with AKI with RRT after cardiac surgery&#xD;
      had 39 times the mortality as patients without AKI (95% CI 32-48).[6] AKI has also been&#xD;
      associated with increased morbidity and a larger number of patients requiring discharge to an&#xD;
      extended care facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathophysiology of AKI after cardiac surgery is multifactorial. Patients undergoing&#xD;
      cardiac surgery are likely more susceptible to AKI given their tendency to be older patients&#xD;
      with multiple co-morbidities including pre-existing chronic kidney disease, cardiac&#xD;
      dysfunction, diabetes mellitus, and advanced age. Cardiac surgery patients are also exposed&#xD;
      to multiple nephrotoxic agents in the peri-operative period including radiocontrast dyes used&#xD;
      for angiography, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and diuretics. Hemodynamically&#xD;
      unstable patients may be subject to low cardiac output and low systemic blood pressure&#xD;
      because of the pathological condition that brings them to the cardiac operating room in the&#xD;
      first place. Low cardiac output and systemic blood pressure can result in reduced renal&#xD;
      perfusion. Induction and the maintenance of anesthesia can result in myocardial depression&#xD;
      and hemodynamic instability, reducing renal perfusion even further. In most cases, cardiac&#xD;
      surgery is facilitated by cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) which is the process of placing the&#xD;
      patient on a heart and lung machine that pumps, oxygenates, and removes CO2 from the&#xD;
      patient's blood for them while the heart is arrested. The CPB circuit itself is known to&#xD;
      cause significant inflammation and hemodynamic changes that may cause renal injury&#xD;
      particularly with prolonged CPB times. Vasopressor and inotropic agents such as vasopressin,&#xD;
      norepinephrine, milrinone, and epinephrine are often used to maintain blood pressure and&#xD;
      cardiac output. While some of these agents may increase systemic blood pressure by increasing&#xD;
      the systemic vascular resistance, this may in fact result in a decrease in renal perfusion.&#xD;
      The affect of these agents on the incidence of AKI is uncertain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditionally, the diagnosis of AKI is based on either a sustained fall in urine output or a&#xD;
      rise in serum creatinine. The 2012 Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO)&#xD;
      classification defines AKI as an increase in serum creatinine by 0.3 mg/dl or more in 48&#xD;
      hours or a rise to at least 1.5 times baseline. Three stages of AKI are then defined based on&#xD;
      increasing values of serum creatinine or duration of decreased urine output.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major limitation of creatinine and urine output as a marker of kidney function is the&#xD;
      time lag between injury and diagnosis. It often takes 24-36 hours after renal injury for&#xD;
      serum creatinine levels to rise. Peri-operative urine output is affected by volume status,&#xD;
      anesthetic drugs, and the use of diuretics and AKI is not diagnosed until oliguria has&#xD;
      occurred for at least 6-12 hrs. This renders serum creatinine and urinary output measurements&#xD;
      insensitive to acute changes in renal function and relatively useless in the acute diagnosis&#xD;
      of AKI during and after cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently, several early biomarkers have been developed to identify patients whom are at&#xD;
      risk for developing AKI. Two of these biomarkers, TIMP-2 and IGFBP7, have been used for the&#xD;
      early prediction of AKI in ICU and cardiac surgery patients. Nonetheless, &quot;early detection&quot;&#xD;
      with these biomarkers is till limited to 3-4 hours (an in some studies 24 hours) after renal&#xD;
      injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of major limitation in the efforts to reduce the incidence of AKI in cardiac surgery is&#xD;
      the lack of a real-time monitor of renal perfusion. As mentioned above, urine output is well&#xD;
      known to be a poor indicator of renal perfusion. While urinary flow rate may be linearly&#xD;
      related to blood pressure while on CPB, this is likely related to a phenomenon called&#xD;
      pressure diuresis and is unlikely to be a reflection of improved renal perfusion. Renal blood&#xD;
      flow can be measured by cannulating the renal vein through a central venous catheter placed&#xD;
      in the femoral vein. This, however, is a highly invasive technique and is not used routinely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result of the lack of real-time monitoring of the kidney during cardiac surgery,&#xD;
      anesthesiologists are often left to make educated guesses as to what blood pressure and&#xD;
      cardiac output are adequate for renal perfusion based on the patients baseline blood pressure&#xD;
      and kidney function. In a patient with a long history of hypertension and/or chronic kidney&#xD;
      disease the anesthesiologist's goal is often to try to maintain a higher mean arterial&#xD;
      pressure (MAP) both on and off CPB than normal in order to &quot;improve renal perfusion&quot;. There&#xD;
      is very little data to support this practice, particularly if we need to use vasopressor&#xD;
      agents to achieve these higher MAP goals, and the exact target MAP in these patients is&#xD;
      unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This lack of real-time monitoring of renal perfusion is in stark contrast to the vigilant&#xD;
      monitoring of the brain during cardiac surgery. Cerebral oxymeters that are routinely used to&#xD;
      measure brain oxygen saturations, transcranial Doppler systems to measure cerebral blood&#xD;
      flow, and EEG to measure brain activity. Often the argument is made to use the brain as an&#xD;
      index organ for adequate perfusion to the rest of the body, but during periods of hemodynamic&#xD;
      instability, brain perfusion is preserved at the cost of other organ. The lower limit of&#xD;
      autoregulation of the brain (the BP below which blood flow becomes dependent on blood&#xD;
      pressure) is thought to be a BP of 50-55 mmHg. [20, 21] Although the exact number in humans&#xD;
      has not been determined and adequate BP for kidney perfusion is widely debated, the lower&#xD;
      limit of autoregulation for the kidney is probably significantly higher than the brain. Brain&#xD;
      desaturations, therefore, may be specific for poor perfusion to other organs such as the&#xD;
      kidney and gut but they are likely not sensitive for these changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adequate renal perfusion is much more complicated than simply measuring renal blood flow or&#xD;
      renal venous oxygenation. Grossly the kidney has three anatomical areas: the renal cortex&#xD;
      where most of the filtration is done, the renal medulla where urine is actively concentrated,&#xD;
      and the renal pelvis where urine is collected. Approximately Â¼ of our cardiac output goes to&#xD;
      our kidneys and most of that perfuses the cortex for filtration. In contrast, the medulla&#xD;
      receives only a limited blood supply. This combined with the high metabolic activity of the&#xD;
      renal medulla results in a relatively hypoxic medullary environment with a normal pO2 of&#xD;
      10-20 mmHg and very little oxygen reserve. Medullary hypoxia may be a consequence of&#xD;
      decreased oxygen delivery or increased oxygen consumption and is a major determinant of AKI&#xD;
      and chronic kidney disease. The relatively hypoxic environment of the renal medulla and it's&#xD;
      role in renal injury suggest that global measures of systemic venous oxygenation through a&#xD;
      central venous catheter or even renal venous oxygenation through an invasive renal vein&#xD;
      catheter may be poor monitors of adequate renal perfusion. The more ideal monitor of renal&#xD;
      hypoxia and kidney injury would be a measure of medullary oxygenation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the physical proximity of the vasa recta in the renal medulla with the urinary&#xD;
      collecting ducts, medullary oxygen tension is more closely related to urinary oxygen tension&#xD;
      than renal venous oxygenation. Medullary oxygen tension has been measured invasively in&#xD;
      animal studies and correlates with both renal pelvic urine and bladder urine oxygenation. In&#xD;
      pigs, bladder urinary oxygenation was shown to decrease with increasing degrees of hypoxemia&#xD;
      and hemorrhage, then restored with resuscitation. These changes were found to proceed other&#xD;
      global hemodynamic changes and increases in base deficit or lactic acidosis. In a sheep model&#xD;
      of sepsis, both medullary and urinary oxygen was decreased and restoration of systemic blood&#xD;
      pressure with norepinephrine further reduced oxygen tension in both the renal medulla and&#xD;
      urine. Both medullary and pelvic urinary oxygen tension were found to decline significantly&#xD;
      with the onset of CPB in pigs, gradually increasing after cessation of bypass but remaining&#xD;
      lower than pre-CPB levels suggesting that the hemodynamics of CPB may be a significant&#xD;
      contributor to the development of AKI in cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1996 Kainuma et al. placed an oxygen electrode inside the urinary catheter of 96 patients&#xD;
      undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB. In their set up, there was 20 ml of deadspace between&#xD;
      the tip of the catheter and the oxymeter. Samples were drawn from a stop-cock near the&#xD;
      oxymeter every two hours for calibration. They found marked decreases in urine oxygen tension&#xD;
      in all patients during CPB. Some patients recovered their urine oxygenation after CPB, but in&#xD;
      34% of patients, urinary oxygen tension continued to decline after bypass and these patients&#xD;
      had significantly higher incidence of AKI. They concluded that urinary oxygen monitoring may&#xD;
      be superior to other more invasive measures of renal perfusion, but to date, no further work&#xD;
      has been published on urine oxygen monitoring in humans during cardiac surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fiber-optic technology has been use in endoscopy for cancer detection. Continuous blood gas&#xD;
      measurements has also been performed in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass by&#xD;
      implanting fiber optic oxygen sensing probes in the internal jugular vein through a central&#xD;
      line catheter or in the radial artery though a radial artery catheter. Continuous blood gas&#xD;
      measurements has also been performed in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass by&#xD;
      implanting fiber optic oxygen sensing probes in the internal jugular vein through a central&#xD;
      line catheter or in the radial artery though a radial artery catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently Evans et al have placed a fiber optic oxygen sensing probe in the tip of a&#xD;
      urinary catheter in 35 patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. Their&#xD;
      study design was very similar to ours in that they placed a fiber-optic oxygen sensing probe&#xD;
      in the tip of a urinary catheter. The difference in our design is that we have created a flow&#xD;
      through chamber with oxygen sensor in it as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The later, we hope will correlate closely with that in the tip of the urinary catheter but&#xD;
      will be a less invasive approach to urine oxygen monitoring. In our study, we plan to place&#xD;
      two fiber optic oxygen tension probes in a standard urinary catheter. The first probe will be&#xD;
      placed within the urinary catheter and threaded to the tip of the catheter (though still&#xD;
      within the catheter and not in the body) in order to measure bladder urine oxygen tension.&#xD;
      The second will be a flow through chamber with a fiber optic oxygen sensor and urinary flow&#xD;
      rate sensor within it. This flow through chamber will be placed between the urinary catheter&#xD;
      and the collecting tubing (see figure 1, attached under &quot;other documents&quot;). A one-way valve&#xD;
      in the flow through chamber will allow passage of urine but prevent back flow of either urine&#xD;
      or air.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that a the less invasive flow through chamber oxymeter will provide similar&#xD;
      measurements to the more proximately placed fiber at the tip of the urinary catheter, that&#xD;
      both will provide reliable measurement of urine oxygenation, and that these measurements will&#xD;
      predict post-operative acute kidney injury in cardiac surgery patients.&#xD;
