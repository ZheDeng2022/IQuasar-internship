  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to prospectively determine, at 12 months post-surgical&#xD;
      repair of full thickness rotator cuff tears, the safety and efficacy of treating full&#xD;
      thickness rotator cuff repairs with pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMF). The hypothesis&#xD;
      states that exposure to a pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) following surgical repair of a&#xD;
      full thickness rotator cuff tendon tear reduces tendon re-tear rates. The strength of the&#xD;
      shoulder muscles and the levels of pain in subjects after surgical repair of their rotator&#xD;
      cuff adjunctively treated with an active PEMF device will also be measured.&#xD;

      This Clinical Investigation Plan (CIP) describes the prospective, randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Pulsed Electromagnetic Field&#xD;
      (PEMF) therapy as an adjunctive treatment to surgical repair of full thickness rotator cuff&#xD;
      tears.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rotator cuff tears are common musculoskeletal injuries which often require surgical&#xD;
      intervention. Unfortunately, post-repair prognosis is poor, and surgical repairs have been&#xD;
      reported to fail in up to 94% of cases (Galatz et. al., 2004). Repaired tissue tends to be&#xD;
      fibrotic, disorganized, and reattaches poorly to the bony insertion. To improve&#xD;
      tendon-to-bone healing, many non-invasive therapeutic devices have been utilized&#xD;
      post-operatively including therapeutic ultrasound and shock wave therapy (Lovric et. al.,&#xD;
      2013; Springer and Badgett, 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In orthopedics, the use of these non-invasive therapeutic devices has become increasingly&#xD;
      popular during the post-operative recovery period in an effort to enhance tissue healing.&#xD;
      These devices are relatively inexpensive and easily obtainable and relatively easy to use,&#xD;
      and are especially enticing as they can be brought into the patient's home and do not require&#xD;
      frequent visits to the clinic. Additionally, non-invasive therapeutic devices can be used for&#xD;
      a variety of applications, including promoting tissue healing prior to surgical intervention&#xD;
      or in lieu of surgical intervention all together. Although there are numerous advantages to&#xD;
      using non-invasive therapeutic devices, their efficacy has not yet been maximized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the pre-clinical work presented (Tucker et. al., 2016; Huegel et. al., 2017), it is&#xD;
      believed that pulsed electromagnetic fields may be an effective adjunctive treatment for&#xD;
      patients who have undergone surgical repair of a torn rotator cuff.&#xD;
