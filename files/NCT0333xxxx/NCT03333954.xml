  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the principle functionality of the device will be tested in humans for the&#xD;
      first time. The study will evaluate the extent to which patients with atrophic dry age&#xD;
      related macular degeneration (AMD) have evoked light perception using the implant.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study subjects are provided with a PRIMA sub-retinal implant in one eye. A camera&#xD;
      integrated in the external components of the implant captures visual information of the&#xD;
      environment, this information is processed by a pocket processor and then transmitted via&#xD;
      projected IR light onto the implant. The implant received the projected IR light and&#xD;
      stimulates the nerve cells of the retina. Interim analysis will be performed at 6 months&#xD;
      after implantation.&#xD;

    <description>The PRIMA Bionic Vision System is a device for treatment of patients who have lost their sight through outer retinal degenerative conditions of the eye such as atrophic dry age related macular degeneration.&#xD;
The PRIMA System is designed to provide partial restoration of the patient's visual function through electrical stimulation of the retinal neurons by a sub-retinally implanted stimulator that replace part of the degenerate photoreceptors</description>
