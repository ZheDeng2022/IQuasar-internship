      The purpose of this study is to conduct a preliminary test of the effectiveness of various&#xD;
      educational interventions to promote adoption of a whole-food, plant-strong diet and reduce&#xD;
      specific cardiovascular risk factors in Veterans, and subsequently perform a preliminary&#xD;
      pilot study on whether this dietary approach will change plaque inflammation and endothelial&#xD;
      function. The specific aims are to conduct a preliminary examination of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The feasibility of Veterans to adopt a whole-food, plant-strong diet within five weeks,&#xD;
           following a plant-strong protocol, or within 90 days following a Plant Strong Diet (PSD)&#xD;
           using Culinary Rx, or by TeleMOVE! (standard of care control). Feasibility factors will&#xD;
           evaluate acceptability and practicality by a measure of the recruitment process,&#xD;
           attrition rate, reasons for dropping, perceived benefit, and comparison of dietary&#xD;
           pattern changes before and after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. Acceptability of a plant-strong diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. (Part 1) The effectiveness of a five-week whole-food, plant-strong diet on&#xD;
           participants':&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Cardiovascular risk factors: Low-Density Lipoprotein, (LDL-C), High-Density&#xD;
                Lipoprotein (HDL), Triglycerides (TG), Total Cholesterol (T Chol), C-Reactive&#xD;
                Protein (CRP), basic chemistry panel, blood pressure, weight, waist circumference,&#xD;
                and percent body fat.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Dietary pattern, particularly the degree to which meat, fish, dairy, and added oils&#xD;
                are decreased or eliminated from the dietary pattern; as well as the degree to&#xD;
                which the consumption of fruits and vegetables (particularly whole-food) are&#xD;
                increased from baseline intake, and the nutrient composition (percent of calories&#xD;
                from protein, fat, carbohydrate, and amount of fiber) of the diet changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. (Part 3) The effectiveness of completing Culinary Rx as compared to TeleMOVE! for 90&#xD;
           days on participants':&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Cardiovascular risk factors: Low-Density Lipoprotein, (LDL-C), High-Density&#xD;
                Lipoprotein (HDL), Triglycerides (TG), Total Cholesterol (T Chol), HgbA1c, blood&#xD;
                pressure, body mass index, weight, waist to hip ratio, and. medication usage (e.g.,&#xD;
                blood pressure, hypoglycemic, lipid lowering and anti-depressants).&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Dietary pattern, particularly the degree to which meat, fish, dairy, and added oils&#xD;
                are decreased or eliminated from the dietary pattern; as well as the degree to&#xD;
                which the consumption of fruits and vegetables (particularly whole-food) are&#xD;
                increased from baseline intake, and the nutrient composition (percent of calories&#xD;
                from protein, fat, carbohydrate, and amount of fiber) of the diet changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Long-term lifestyle changes as measured by sustainability of dietary pattern and&#xD;
                cardiovascular risk changes that occurred at 90 days and were still present at six&#xD;
                months and one year, (excluding change in plaque inflammation and endothelial&#xD;
                function).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Establish the ability of Positron Emission Tomography 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose&#xD;
           radiopharmaceutical and magnetic resonance imaging (PET FDG-MRI) to assess serial change&#xD;
           in plaque inflammation and plaque volume (Part 2) and then perform a pilot test to&#xD;
           assess whether a 90-day PSD using Culinary Rx, or TeleMOVE! reduces plaque inflammation&#xD;
           using FDG uptake on PET scan and structural changes on MRI (Part 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Correlation analysis of aortic/carotid FDG uptake versus Framingham risk score from&#xD;
                consecutive subjects who underwent PET FDG for clinical indications at Phoenix VA&#xD;
                from January 1, 2010-May 31, 2015.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Change in aortic/carotid plaque FDG uptake, plaque volume and aortic pulse wave&#xD;
                velocity (measure of aortic/arterial stiffness) at baseline and following 90-day&#xD;
                PSD using Culinary Rx, or TeleMOVE! (pilot prospective study).&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Subjects will be randomized 2:1 into Culinary Rx or TeleMOVE! prior to baseline measures. We plan to enroll a subset of the 80 participants to undergo a PET-MRI sub-study (total of 21 participants). This cohort requires participants to have a pooled cohort risk score of ≥ 7.5%, be willing and able to undergo FDG-PET-MRI. [The ACC/AHA pooled risk calculator utilizes information such as age, lipid profile, hypertension to estimate 10 year risk of ASCVD.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Veterans randomized to the experimental arm will participate in Culinary Rx. Culinary Rx is an online instructional cooking and nutrition course that healthcare professionals can prescribe to patients who need to transition away from a Standard American Diet to a more health-supportive, whole foods, plant-based lifestyle. In partnership with The Plantrician Project, this course will focus on teaching the foundational cooking skills needed for long-term behavioral change, coupled with lifestyle education around nutrition and resources that will help users successfully face the many challenges inherent to dietary change.</description>
