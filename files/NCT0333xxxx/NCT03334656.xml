  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cell-based engineered skin substitutes are promising to treat difficult-to-heal acute and&#xD;
      chronic wounds such as large/deep burns, ulcers resistant to conventional therapies or&#xD;
      surgical wounds. Cultured autologous epidermal cell-based therapy is used for more than two&#xD;
      decades as permanent wound coverage for large burns. Although this technique has been shown&#xD;
      to improve outcomes in patients with large burn injuries, its clinical use is limited by the&#xD;
      creation of a second wound at the donor site, the three-week delay needed to obtain&#xD;
      sufficient amounts of cells, and the absence of a dermal component resulting in low graft&#xD;
      take and wound contraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concurrently, allogeneic cell-based engineered skin substitutes have been proposed. Where&#xD;
      they offer off-the-shelf temporary wound coverage acting as biologically active dressings&#xD;
      releasing growth factors, cytokines and extra cellular matrix components essential for proper&#xD;
      wound healing, they are susceptible of immune rejection that is their major weakness Fetal&#xD;
      skin, before the third trimester of gestational age, heals rapidly without scar formation&#xD;
      conversely to adult skin. Minimal inflammation, specific cytokine and growth factor profiles,&#xD;
      and faster and organized deposit and turnover of Extra Cellular Matrix (ECM) components&#xD;
      during fetal wound healing have been proposed to explain the absence of scar formation.&#xD;
      Because of their low immunogenicity, and their unique regeneration properties, fetal skin&#xD;
      cells represent an attractive alternative to the commonly used autologous and allogenic&#xD;
      cutaneous grafts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators developed a new healing dressing constituted by a collagen sponge seeded&#xD;
      with a specific ratio of active fetal fibroblasts and keratinocytes producing a variety of&#xD;
      wound healing growth factors and cytokines which increase the speed of wound healing, induce&#xD;
      an immunotolerant state, with a low inflammatory reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective randomized controlled study aims to compare wound healing of CICAFAST versus&#xD;
      conventional treatment (JELONET®) in the treatment of split-thickness skin graft donor site&#xD;
      at D8. The patient will be his own control.&#xD;

    <description>It is a cellularized dressing of 100 cm² composed of fetal skin cells associated to a bovine collagen matrix:&#xD;
Fetal skin cells were obtained from a single fetal skin sample and consist in two clinical grade banks of keratinocytes (reference BKF07 K CB1) and fibroblasts (reference BKF07 WCB F d P3) produced at the UTCG. These two clinical grade cells banks were fully characterized and secure.&#xD;
The matrix is a customized type I calf collagen produced by the company Symatese. Symatese's collagen is in compliance with the European requirements</description>

    <description>It is a low-adherent, sterile paraffin Tulle Gras dressing made from open weave gauze. The gauze has interlocking threads which minimize fraying when the dressing is cut to shape. JELONET® dressings are non-medicated and are used as a primary wound contact layer with paraffin present to reduce the adherence of the product to the surface of a granulating wound.&#xD;
JELONET® is a product of Smith-Nephew, it has the CE-mark (n°0086) and the class of this medical device is IIa.&#xD;
The features of this dressing are: Soft paraffin base, Sterile leno weave presentation, Comprehensive size range.</description>
