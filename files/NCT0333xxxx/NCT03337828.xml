      This a controlled, double-blind, randomized, cross designed study to determine the effect of&#xD;
      an alcohol-free beer with low glycemic index carbohydrates (isomaltulose) and a resistant&#xD;
      maltodextrin, comparing to an alcohol-free beer with regular composition, on glycemic&#xD;
      metabolism (glucose, glycated hemoglobin, insulin and HOMA index) in subjects with recently&#xD;
      diagnosed diabetes mellitus and overweight or obesity. 44 subjects were randomized to consume&#xD;
      for 10 weeks: a) two alcohol-free beers with regular carbohydrates composition per day; b)&#xD;
      two alcohol-free beers with modified carbohydrates composition per day. Those subjects&#xD;
      randomized to begin with A beer during 10 weeks will change to B beer during the second phase&#xD;
      for 10 weeks and vice versa. There is a 4-8 weeks wash-out period between two phases.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study involves a nutritional intervention with a controlled, double-blind, randomized,&#xD;
      cross design. It includes 44 healthy subjects with a total duration of 20 weeks with a&#xD;
      &quot;wash-out/stabilization&quot; period for 2-4 weeks before randomization. Subjects are randomized&#xD;
      in two groups: (1) those who begin drinking 2 alcohol-free beers (33 cl each one) that are&#xD;
      enriched in a resistant maltodextrin and isomaltulose during 10 weeks and continue drinking 2&#xD;
      alcohol-free beers (33 cl each one) with regular composition during the next 10 weeks&#xD;
      following; (2) those who will follow the same previous intervention but in reverse, beginning&#xD;
      with standard alcohol-free beer for 10 weeks, followed by resistant maltodextrin and&#xD;
      isomaltulose-enriched beer for the remaining 10 weeks. There is a washout period between both&#xD;
      phases to facilitate adherence to nutritional intervention, since we consider that a period&#xD;
      of 20 consecutive weeks could be difficult to assume for the participants. Participants and&#xD;
      the research team are &quot;blind&quot; to the type of beer that subjects are taking in each phase.&#xD;
      Only one person of the company that provide beers, which does not directly participate in the&#xD;
      clinic visits or in the analysis of the data, is aware of this information. Clinical staff&#xD;
      performed the randomization based on a computerized method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among those subjects included in the study, microbiota sub-study is proposed which require a&#xD;
      specific authorization within informed consent. Among all subjects that are included in this&#xD;
      substudy and that have completed the whole nutritional intervention, 10 subjects (5 from each&#xD;
      randomized group) will be selected to microbiota determination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Prescreening visit: Inclusion and exclusion criteria assessment and blood&#xD;
                collection if glucose or glycated hemoglobin is not available in previous 3 months.&#xD;
                Healthy diet and physical activity counselling is provided by a nutritionist; it&#xD;
                should be maintained during all study. Baseline visit is scheduled in 2-4 weeks&#xD;
                after lifestyle stabilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Baseline phase 1 visit: Clinical, biochemical, dietary, physical activity and&#xD;
                anthropometric data are assessed. Computer-based randomization is performed.&#xD;
                Alcohol-free beer (A or B according to randomization procedures) for the next 10&#xD;
                weeks is delivered to the participant who has to consume two per day. A&#xD;
                nutritionist emphasizes healthy lifestyle counselling to the participant. A feces&#xD;
                sample is collected if subjects accept to be included in microbiota sub study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Intermediate phase 1 visit: Clinical, biochemical, dietary, physical activity and&#xD;
                anthropometric data are assessed. Satiety after alcohol-free beer consumption is&#xD;
                measured by a validated questionnaire. A nutritionist emphasizes healthy lifestyle&#xD;
                counselling to the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. End of phase 1 visit: Clinical, biochemical, dietary, physical activity and&#xD;
                anthropometric data are assessed. Satiety after alcohol-free beer consumption is&#xD;
                measured by a validated questionnaire. A nutritionist emphasizes healthy lifestyle&#xD;
                counselling to the participant. A wash-out period of 4-8 weeks is scheduled before&#xD;
                the next phase start. A feces sample is collected if subjects accept to be included&#xD;
                in microbiota sub study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Baseline phase 2 visit: Clinical, biochemical, dietary, physical activity and&#xD;
                anthropometric data are assessed. Alcohol-free beer (A or B: if subjects consumed&#xD;
                alcohol-free beer A, he/she change to alcohol-free B and vice versa) for the next&#xD;
                10 weeks is delivered to the participant who has to consume two per day. A&#xD;
                nutritionist emphasizes healthy lifestyle counselling to the participant. A feces&#xD;
                sample is collected if subjects accept to be included in microbiota sub study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Intermediate phase 2 visit: Clinical, biochemical, dietary, physical activity and&#xD;
                anthropometric data are assessed. Satiety after alcohol-free beer consumption is&#xD;
                measured by a validated questionnaire. A nutritionist emphasizes healthy lifestyle&#xD;
                counselling to the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. End of phase 2 visit: Clinical, biochemical, dietary, physical activity and&#xD;
                anthropometric data are assessed. Satiety after alcohol-free beer consumption is&#xD;
                measured by a validated questionnaire. A nutritionist emphasizes healthy lifestyle&#xD;
                counselling to the participant. A feces sample is collected if subjects accept to&#xD;
                be included in microbiota sub study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Clinical variables: Gender, age, medical records including diseases and medication,&#xD;
                tobacco consumption and blood pressure.&#xD;

             -  Anthropometric variables: Weight, height, body mass index, waist circumference,&#xD;
                body composition analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Biochemical variables: Glucose, lipid and iron metabolism are assessed.&#xD;
                Inflammatory biomarkers, including C reactive protein, are also determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Microbiota: Feces samples are collected to microbiota analysis including&#xD;
                Bacteroides, Lactobacillus, Enterococcus, Prevotella or Roseburia, among others.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Dietary and physical activity assessment: Diet and physical activity are assessed&#xD;
                by validated questionnaires.&#xD;
