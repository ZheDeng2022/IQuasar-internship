      ISCoPE-TM will use intra spinal monitoring techniques to assess cord perfusion and metabolism&#xD;
      in patients with severe spinal cord damage from transverse myelitis&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transverse myelitis (TM) is a rare inflammatory condition of the spinal cord. It is&#xD;
      characterised by rapid onset of motor, sensory or autonomic dysfunction causing neurological&#xD;
      deficit. It has a diverse range of causes; most commonly it is associated with multiple&#xD;
      sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica also known as Devic's disease or Devic's syndrome, is a&#xD;
      heterogeneous condition consisting of the simultaneous inflammation and demyelination of the&#xD;
      optic nerve (optic neuritis) and the spinal cord (myelitis). It affects approximately 1900&#xD;
      adults and children in the UK annually, with 350 cases per year of unknown cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome in TM is variable; e.g. neuromyelitis optica mortality can be 30% . There is a&#xD;
      relationship between the severity of neurological symptoms at presentation and the eventual&#xD;
      outcome. When a patient is ASIA (American spinal injuries association) A or tetraplegic at&#xD;
      presentation, they are less likely to recover than when ASIA B/C or paraplegic. Approximately&#xD;
      30% of patients will be ASIA A-C after a TM episode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several pathological mechanisms which could increase the risk of decreased blood&#xD;
      supply and further neurological deficit in TM. The ISCoPE study has shown that in traumatic&#xD;
      spinal cord injury when swelling causes mechanical compression of the cord against the dura&#xD;
      there is increased intra spinal pressure (ISP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators propose to monitor the ISP and spinal cord metabolites in 10 TM patients&#xD;
      with MRI evidence of a swollen enlarged spinal cord. There has never been a study looking at&#xD;
      ISP in TM patients before. The optimum blood pressure in patients with TM is not known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to observe a previously unrecognised pathological mechanism of injury&#xD;
      in TM. In the future this could lead on to novel treatments to improve drug delivery and&#xD;
      neurological outcome in a condition otherwise associated with a poor outcome.&#xD;
