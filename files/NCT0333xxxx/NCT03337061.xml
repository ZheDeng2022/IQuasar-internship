      To evaluate the efficacy of mediation therapies on measures of sleep and arousal for people&#xD;
      with chronic insomnia and with this the viability of smartphone delivered meditation based&#xD;
      approaches at a population level.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sleep complaints are amongst the commonest in medical practice, and insomnia, the commonest&#xD;
      of these affecting transiently 1/3 of the population at some point in the year and 1/3 of&#xD;
      this population that is 1 in 10 persisting as chronic insomnia. There are significant&#xD;
      consequences on the quality of life for individuals and significant economic burden for&#xD;
      society.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insomnia disorder is characterized as persistent difficulty in falling or staying asleep with&#xD;
      resulting daytime dysfunction. Once physical and psychiatric causes have been excluded,&#xD;
      current treatment guidelines include pharmacological and behavioural approaches. Hypnotic&#xD;
      therapy will reduce sleep latency and increase total sleep time, but there are concerns about&#xD;
      drug dependency and side effects (residual day time sleepiness and road traffic accidents and&#xD;
      impaired balance). Behavioural treatment (CBTi) has been shown to be effective, but&#xD;
      availability is scarce and less than 50% of patients achieve full remission, making&#xD;
      alternative approaches desirable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To optimize availability and to improve outcomes, approaches have included group sessions,&#xD;
      single treatment sessions and internet sessions, but these are still limited in the NHS by&#xD;
      availability of resources or by expense. Mindfulness meditation, focused non-judgmental&#xD;
      awareness and attention on the present moment experience, can promote calmness and&#xD;
      relaxation. Several health benefits have been shown across stress related conditions,&#xD;
      including sleep disturbance, and its universal availability and ease of application make it&#xD;
      an attractive alternative to conventional CBTi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized controlled trial compared Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR),&#xD;
      Mindfulness-Based Therapy for Insomnia (MBTI), and Self-monitoring (SM) in the treatment of&#xD;
      chronic insomnia . Results indicate that those receiving mindfulness-based interventions&#xD;
      (MBSR or MBTI) had significant reductions in total wake time and pre-sleep arousal from&#xD;
      baseline-to-post compared to SM. The study concluded that mindfulness meditation appears to&#xD;
      be a viable treatment option for adults with chronic insomnia and could provide an&#xD;
      alternative to traditional treatments for insomnia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent meta-analysis of 6 randomised controlled trials demonstrated that mindfulness&#xD;
      meditation may contribute to improving sleep in subjects with insomnia compared to a control&#xD;
      group. Specifically, mindfulness meditation was found to significantly reduce total wake&#xD;
      time, sleep onset latency and sleep quality .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study builds upon this work, using a small-scale randomized controlled trial to&#xD;
      gather preliminary evidence for the treatment efficacy of a brief mindfulness intervention&#xD;
      delivered through a mobile application. Headspace (www.headspace.com) mindfulness app will be&#xD;
      used to deliver the meditation content. Headspace currently has over 7 million users&#xD;
      worldwide and was recently rated in a systematic review as being the highest quality&#xD;
      mindfulness app on the market . Participants are adults with insomnia recruited through a&#xD;
      sleep centre, recruited for management of their insomnia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential risks of the study are low, as participants will be exposed to a low dose of&#xD;
      mindfulness (10 minutes daily). Adverse effects of meditation have been reported in people&#xD;
      with a predisposition to psychiatric illness that underwent extensive mindfulness training,&#xD;
      such as a 10-day silent retreat. Negative effects have not been reported from 8-week&#xD;
      mindfulness interventions. The benefits from this study include improvement in or resolution&#xD;
      of insomnia.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Insomnia Severity (Insomnia Severity Index)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks, 3 and 6 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Insomnia Severity Index (ISI): The Insomnia Severity Index has seven questions. The seven answers are added up to get a total score. This will be administered at baseline, after 8-weeks and at a 3 and 6-month follow-up. The index will be sent to by post and. It will take approximately 5 minutes to complete.</description>

    <measure>Change in Actigraphy determined wake time (TWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>2-week screening, 8-week intervention, 3 and 6-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Actigraphy: Sleep onset latency (SOL) and wake after sleep onset (WASO) will be determined using wrist actigraphy. Participants will be provided with an actiwatch during the screening interview conducted at the beginning of the study. The actiwatch will be worn on the non-dominant arm 24 hours a day, except for while bathing, during the 2-week screening period. Additionally, the actiwatch will be worn for one week after the 8-week intervention and for one week prior to the 3 and 6-month follow-up. Participants will send the actiwatch to the investigator by post after each measurement period. The actiwatch will be sent to participants by post before the next measurement point; apart from the first time point where the participant will be given the actiwatch.</description>
