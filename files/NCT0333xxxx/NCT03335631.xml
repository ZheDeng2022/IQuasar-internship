  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer affects 1 in 7 men. Half of these men are treated with androgen deprivation&#xD;
      therapy (ADT). ADT slows disease progression and prolongs survival, but it also leads to&#xD;
      worse quality of life (QOL), fatigue, loss of strength and fitness, osteoporosis, and&#xD;
      diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' recent research has shown that individually supervised exercise,&#xD;
      supervised group exercise and home-based exercise are equally good at improving these side&#xD;
      effects. Now the investigators are doing a larger trial with multiple centres to see whether&#xD;
      supervised group or home-based exercise is clinically better and more economical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A major challenge in such trials is that a significant number of men refuse to be randomized&#xD;
      because (a) the participant lives too far from a study centre and cannot come for supervised&#xD;
      exercise; or (b) the participant has a strong preference as to which type of exercise program&#xD;
      the participant wants to do. Experts have raised concerns that classic randomized trials are&#xD;
      too restrictive, selective, and less practical; the study results are less applicable to the&#xD;
      real world. Despite its obvious importance, it is not known whether men who refuse to be&#xD;
      randomized to an exercise trial but are otherwise willing to participate would benefit&#xD;
      similarly to men who are randomized. In this study, we will recruit men who are otherwise&#xD;
      eligible for our randomized trial but refuse it for one of the reasons above. We will allow&#xD;
      these men to choose either supervised group or home-based exercise, and then compare them to&#xD;
      the men who are being randomized to the two treatments in 3 important ways. First, are&#xD;
      participants similar in terms of personal characteristics, QOL, and fitness levels? Second,&#xD;
      do participants respond similarly to exercise in terms of QOL and physical fitness benefits?&#xD;
      Third, do participants actually exercise as much as the randomized men? This work will help&#xD;
      the research team understand whether there is a need to change the way exercise trials are&#xD;
      done in order to be more relevant and wide-reaching for Canadians with a variety of health&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND: The backbone of scientific evidence to address most scientific questions,&#xD;
      including behavioural interventions, is randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Prostate cancer&#xD;
      is the most common malignancy in men, affecting 1 in 7 men. Almost 50% of these men will&#xD;
      receive androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) at some point after diagnosis to reduce disease&#xD;
      progression and prolong survival. ADT is associated with multiple adverse effects, including&#xD;
      diminished quality of life (QOL), fatigue, reduced muscle mass, and metabolic effects.&#xD;
      Numerous RCTs in the setting of men on ADT have demonstrated that exercise programs,&#xD;
      particularly supervised 1:1 in-centre programs, are clinically effective. However, they are&#xD;
      resource-intensive and have low scalability. Alternative delivery models such as group-based&#xD;
      supervised exercise or home-based exercise are promising alternatives but require rigorous&#xD;
      efficacy data. While conducting a two-centre exercise trial comparing different exercise&#xD;
      delivery models, fewer than 40% of eligible men agreed to participate. Two common reasons why&#xD;
      men declined participation were distance to exercise centres and unwillingness to be&#xD;
      randomized. Novel clinical trial designs, such as preference-based trials, may help answer&#xD;
      effectiveness questions and enhance generalizability by recruiting a more representative pool&#xD;
      of men. Increased efficiencies in recruitment, however, may come at a cost of bias with&#xD;
      non-randomized designs as well as differential effects of exercise and varying adherence. In&#xD;
      parallel with a multi-centre phase III RCT funded by CIHR, we propose to conduct a pilot&#xD;
      preference-based trial, examining 3 key issues. First, can we successfully enroll men who are&#xD;
      unwilling to be randomized due either to distance from centre or a strong preference for one&#xD;
      exercise delivery model? Second, are these men different from men who are randomized in terms&#xD;
      of baseline characteristics, study retention, and adherence to the intervention? Third, are&#xD;
      the benefits of an exercise program similar to men who are randomized to the same arm?&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine, in men with PC on ADT who are otherwise eligible to participate in a RCT of&#xD;
      different exercise delivery models but decline to be randomized due to distance from the&#xD;
      study centre or strong preference for one exercise delivery model:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What proportion of these men is willing to be enrolled in a preference-based trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. How comparable are baseline characteristics of men who agree to participate in the&#xD;
           intervention arm of their choice and all those in the randomized study?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. How comparable are study retention and adherence to the intervention for men in the&#xD;
           corresponding arms of the preference based trial and randomized trial?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. How comparable are the benefits in terms of quality of life (QOL) and physical fitness&#xD;
           outcomes in those with a preference for a particular exercise and those without a&#xD;
           preference?&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Systematic differences exist in baseline characteristics, specifically distance to the&#xD;
           study centre, age, education, prior experience with participating in exercise programs,&#xD;
           and fatigue severity among participants willing to be randomized versus not randomized&#xD;
           to an exercise intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Adherence will be greater among those selecting treatment by preference vs being&#xD;
           randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Benefits (QOL and fitness) will be greater among those selecting treatment versus being&#xD;
           randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: Patients aged 18 or older on ADT for high-risk/locally advanced, biochemically&#xD;
      relapsed, or asymptomatic metastatic prostate cancer will be eligible if they are otherwise&#xD;
      eligible for an ongoing phase III RCT of exercise but decline to participate due to either&#xD;
      distance from study centre or strong preference for one exercise delivery model. The main&#xD;
      phase III RCT is examining a 6-month individualized, progressive, mixed-modality exercise&#xD;
      program including aerobic, resistance, and flexibility components delivered using one of two&#xD;
      delivery models: supervised in-centre group exercise 3 times weekly or home-based exercise&#xD;
      supported by a Fitbit, smart phone app, and remote health coach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To meet the objectives of this pilot preference trial, we will enroll 50 men per preference&#xD;
      arm at three experienced study sites (Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, Scarborough&#xD;
      and Rouge Hospital, Scarborough and the University of Calgary, Calgary and). Aim 1. We will&#xD;
      report the proportion of men who are eligible for the preference-based trial who agree to&#xD;
      participate, overall and by treatment arm and reason for refusal to be randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2/Hypotheses 1 and 2. We will compare the participants in the preference-based trial to&#xD;
      those in the RCT. Comparisons of baseline characteristics will be between the total number of&#xD;
      participants in the RCT compared separately to each arm of the preference trial. ANOVA will&#xD;
      be used for continuous variables and chi-square analysis for categorical variables. Variables&#xD;
      to be compared include distance from participants' home to the study centre, age, education,&#xD;
      prior participation in an exercise program, and symptom severity. Differences will be&#xD;
      presented with 95% CIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3/Hypothesis 3. Within-group change scores will be assessed for the preference-based&#xD;
      groups, and the mean changes along with the 95%CIs will be reported. Next, we will compare&#xD;
      these changes for the co-primary and secondary outcomes between the preference-based groups&#xD;
      and the phase III RCT (e.g., combined preference arms to combined RCT arm) to obtain the&#xD;
      so-called selection-effect. Finally, although it is subject to confounding by unknown&#xD;
      preference effects in the RCT participants, we will estimate the differences between outcomes&#xD;
      in those randomized to and choosing each specific exercise delivery method, using constrained&#xD;
      linear mixed effects model adjusting for the baseline value and ADT duration. Skewed data&#xD;
      will be transformed as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SIGNIFICANCE: Behavioural interventions require significant patient commitment and although&#xD;
      most RCTs to date have shown evidence of benefit on various outcomes, recruitment rates have&#xD;
      been low and many otherwise eligible men are not willing to be randomized for different&#xD;
      reasons. Designing trials that allow inclusion of such men is obviously going to improve&#xD;
      generalizability but whether the results of interventions are similarly effective and&#xD;
      understanding the feasibility and potential biases of enrolling such men are fundamental&#xD;
      unresolved issues. This pilot study will take advantage of an existing trial to begin to&#xD;
      answer these questions and determine whether a larger preference-based trial is worth&#xD;
      undertaking. Our findings have potential widespread implications for behavioural trials&#xD;
      across many health care settings.&#xD;

    <description>This intervention arm will include 3 group, supervised sessions per week for 6 months with a certified exercise specialist. Supervised sessions will be delivered in a group format with 4-8 participants per group. Flexibility training will include stretching for 5-10 minutes at the beginning and end of each session. Aerobic training will involve 30 minutes of low-impact step aerobics. Resistance training will be conducted using resistance bands, a stability ball, and an exercise mat with 8 prescribed exercises that target the major muscle groups. Participants will be encouraged to perform exercises independently on additional days, for a total of 4-5 days per week of exercise.</description>
