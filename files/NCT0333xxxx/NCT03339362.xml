  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lumbar facet-joints are small, paired joints in the low back that provide stability,&#xD;
      integrity and flexibility of movement to the spine. Diseased facet-joints may cause&#xD;
      persistent low back pain, with significant socioeconomic impact. At present, there is&#xD;
      insufficient high quality evidence to support the use of lumbar facet-joint injections (FJIs)&#xD;
      in treating low back pain of less than 12 months' duration; the National Institute for Health&#xD;
      and Care Excellence (NICE) therefore did not approved their use in their 2009 publication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will investigate the feasibility of conducting a larger, definitive trial to&#xD;
      assess lumbar FJIs (a needle is inserted into the facet-joint and steroid injected), by&#xD;
      comparing it to a dummy or 'sham' procedure (a needle is inserted near the facet-joint but no&#xD;
      therapeutic substance injected).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with persistent low back pain, referred to a community or hospital-based pain,&#xD;
      spinal or musculoskeletal clinic by their general practitioner, will be reviewed and assessed&#xD;
      by a specialist physician. They will be screened and recruited based on clinical history and&#xD;
      examination. Participants will receive diagnostic injections (medial branch nerve blocks);&#xD;
      those with a positive response will randomly receive either FJIs or a sham procedure, under&#xD;
      x-ray guidance. All participants will receive a combined physical and psychological programme&#xD;
      recommended by NICE as a strategy to reduce pain and its impact on the person's day-to-day&#xD;
      life, even if the pain cannot be cured completely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to complete questionnaires comparing a range of pain and&#xD;
      disability-related issues. These will occur at baseline (before treatment) and at 6 weeks, 3&#xD;
      months and 6 months after their injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for the study to be considered successful (and a definitive trial feasible) include&#xD;
      the abilities to standardise the methods for injection and to recruit and retain sufficient&#xD;
      participants, and the acceptability of the study design to participants and clinicians.&#xD;

      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study seeks to examine the feasibility of undertaking a fully powered double-blind&#xD;
      randomised controlled trial. Patients with non-specific low back pain of more than three&#xD;
      months' duration with confirmed facet-joint disease will be individually randomised 1:1 to&#xD;
      receive facet-joint injections plus a combined physical and psychological programme&#xD;
      (intervention group) or to a sham (placebo) procedure plus a combined physical and&#xD;
      psychological programme (control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting&#xD;
&#xD;
      The feasibility study will be conducted in three hospital-based pain medicine centres: Barts&#xD;
      Health NHS Trust (formerly Barts and The London NHS Trust), Basildon and Thurrock University&#xD;
      Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, and The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited from pain, spinal and musculoskeletal clinics at the three&#xD;
      participating NHS centres and their associated community clinics. Patients will be referred&#xD;
      by their general practitioners with low back pain requiring further specialist assessment,&#xD;
      for reasons such as uncertain diagnosis, failure of conservative treatment, or expectation of&#xD;
      therapeutic interventions. A screening visit will be used to identify eligible patients i.e.&#xD;
      pain of at least 3 months' duration and an average pain intensity numerical rating score&#xD;
      (NRS) of at least 4/10 in the 7 preceding days, signs and symptoms of facet-joint disease&#xD;
      including bilateral localised paraspinal tenderness at 2 lumbar levels, and have received two&#xD;
      components of NICE-defined best non-invasive care (education and one of: physical exercise&#xD;
      programme, acupuncture, or manual therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health technologies being assessed&#xD;
&#xD;
      Facet-joint injections of local anaesthetic and steroid for non-specific low back pain.&#xD;
      (Delivered in this study as four X-ray guided intra-articular facet-joint injections through&#xD;
      a spinal needle at two lumbar levels bilaterally, using 0.5ml 0.5% bupivacaine + 20mg&#xD;
      methylprednisolone per joint, under fluoroscopic guidance.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of costs and outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcomes for this feasibility study include: patient recruitment and attrition&#xD;
      rates, levels of patient completion of outcomes, acceptability of the study design to&#xD;
      patients and clinicians, fidelity of sham injection and process of blinding, and collection&#xD;
      of variance outcome data to inform a future sample size calculation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have proposed stopping rules for progression to a main trial. The proposed&#xD;
      outcomes for the main trial have been selected in accord with IMMPACT recommendations for&#xD;
      chronic pain trials and include: pain assessment, psychological well-being, health-related&#xD;
      quality of life, functional disability, health care utilisation including analgesic usage,&#xD;
      lost productivity and complications/level of adverse events. Outcomes will be collected at&#xD;
      clinic visits at baseline (pre-randomisation) and at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months&#xD;
      post-randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will recruit a total of 150 patients who will undergo a diagnostic&#xD;
      facet-joint injection to determine eligibility to participate (test positive for facet-joint&#xD;
      disease). Sixty participants (40% of all recruited) are expected to have a positive response&#xD;
      to the diagnostic test; these 60 patients will be randomly and equally allocated to&#xD;
      intervention and control groups. Assuming up to a 33% attrition rate, the investigators will&#xD;
      have &gt;24 complete data sets per arm at the end of the study. This sample size will allow us&#xD;
      to achieve our various feasibility objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project timetables including recruitment rate&#xD;
&#xD;
      A retrospective audit of patient throughput in participating clinics shows that recruitment&#xD;
      to achieve 30 patients per treatment arm is readily feasible in the time frame of this study.&#xD;
      From 1000 new patient attendances for low back pain at the pain services, the investigators&#xD;
      expect approximately 1 in 4 patients to be eligible to enter the study. This is based on our&#xD;
      clinical experience and published studies based on responses to controlled diagnostic&#xD;
      facet-joint injections, performed in accordance with the criteria established by the&#xD;
      International Association for the Study of Pain. Of these 250 patients, approximately 60%&#xD;
      (150) will consent to enter the study, of whom approximately 40% (60 patients) are expected&#xD;
      to have a positive response from diagnostic medial branch nerve blocks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators anticipate that the project will take a total of 21 months to complete.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Patients with persistent low back pain, referred to a community or hospital-based pain clinic by their general practitioner, will be reviewed and assessed by a pain physiotherapist and pain physician.

    <time_frame>Baseline (visit 1) and diagnostic injections (visit 2)</time_frame>
    <description>The rationale for carrying out diagnostic medial branch nerve blocks is because of their safety, simplicity and prognostic value.&#xD;
There is currently no justification for double, comparative blocks as these are associated with a significant false-negative rate and are not shown to be cost-effective.&#xD;
The pain scores at baseline (recruitment) will be recorded using a numerical rating scale (0-10) and will be compared to the score taken 20-40 minutes and 180-200 minutes after the injections. If a positive response of 50% pain reduction is seen, we know the pain is definately coming from the facet- joint which entitles the patient to be eligible for the randomised procedure.</description>

             the trunk wall caused by ectopic activation of nociceptive afferent fibres in a spinal&#xD;
             nerve or its roots or other neuropathic mechanisms. The pain is lancinating in quality&#xD;
