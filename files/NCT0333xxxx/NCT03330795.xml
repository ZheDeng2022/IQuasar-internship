      The purpose of this study is to determine whether bilateral orthotopic lung transplantation&#xD;
      (BOLT) followed by cadaveric partially-matched CD3+/CD19+ depleted bone marrow transplant&#xD;
      (BMT) is safe and effective for individuals aged 10 through 45 years with the diagnosis of&#xD;
      primary immunodeficiency (PID) and end-stage lung disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The enrollment goal: 8 participants who receive both BOLT and BMT.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of performing&#xD;
      bilateral orthotopic lung transplantation (BOLT) followed by cadaveric, partially HLA-matched&#xD;
      CD3+/CD19+-depleted hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from the same donor for&#xD;
      participants with primary immunodeficiency diseases (PID) and end-stage lung disease. For&#xD;
      many patients with primary immunodeficiencies, HSCT, which we refer to as Bone Marrow&#xD;
      Transplant (BMT) is a curative, life-saving therapy, resulting in restoration of function in&#xD;
      the immune system. Patients with primary immunodeficiencies often develop pulmonary&#xD;
      complications as a result of chronic or recurrent infections, making them ineligible for BMT&#xD;
      due to the high risk of mortality and pulmonary complications. Lung transplant prior to BMT&#xD;
      would allow for restoration of pulmonary function prior to BMT, allowing PID patients to&#xD;
      proceed to BMT , which would be curative for the patient's underlying immunodeficiency. As a&#xD;
      secondary aim, after successful engraftment with donor bone marrow, the feasibility of&#xD;
      participants tolerating planned withdrawal of immunosuppression and achieving eventual&#xD;
      freedom from all immunosuppressive drugs and attaining a tolerant state will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single center study in which participants receive a cadaveric, partially Human&#xD;
      Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-matched lung transplant followed by a CD3+/CD19+ depleted bone marrow&#xD;
      transplant (BMT) from the same donor. In this study, the investigators will use a ≥ 2/6&#xD;
      HLA-matched T cell depleted bone marrow transplant from a cadaveric organ donor with an&#xD;
      identical ABO blood type as the recipient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bilateral orthotopic lung transplant (BOLT) utilizing basiliximab induction or an&#xD;
           alternate induction therapy based on their underlying disease. Rituximab may be&#xD;
           initiated prior to the lung transplant, with tacrolimus as the ongoing maintenance&#xD;
           immunosuppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BMT utilizing CD3+/CD19+-depleted bone marrow with bone marrow conditioning beginning no&#xD;
           less than 8 weeks after BOLT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of participant involvement in the trial is up to 2 years post-BMT.&#xD;
