  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this 2-phase, randomized clinical trial will be to examine the effects of two&#xD;
      behavioral weight loss interventions on weight loss. This study will be conducted in 200&#xD;
      overweight or obese prediabetic individuals recruited from community-based settings.. Phase 1&#xD;
      will include 6-months of active intervention. Phase 2 will consist of 6-months of maintenance&#xD;
      and observation. Measurements will occur at screening, baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized with equal allocation to 2 groups: (1) a standardized&#xD;
      behavioral weight loss intervention with a one-size-fits-all regimen that includes counseling&#xD;
      about restriction of calories and calories from fat, and physical activity, delivered using&#xD;
      mHealth technology, or (2) all of the elements of mHealth, plus personalized dietary&#xD;
      recommendations to minimize glycemic response to meals. Participants will be required to&#xD;
      attend 6 separate visits over both phases of the study.&#xD;
