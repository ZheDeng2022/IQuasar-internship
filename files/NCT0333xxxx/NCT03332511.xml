      ENESTKorea is a phase 4, multi-institutional, single-arm, open-label study investigating the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of nilotinib at the currently approved dose (300 mg twice daily) and its&#xD;
      exposure-outcome relationship, in adult patients diagnosed as Philadelphia&#xD;
      chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nilotinib is a second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor with improved efficacy compared to&#xD;
      imatinib. However, there are still many patients for whom the therapeutic response is&#xD;
      inadequate, or toxicity is limiting the treatment. Serum concentration of nilotinib was shown&#xD;
      to affect time to response and progression in previous studies. Therefore, the investigators&#xD;
      hypothesized that the optimal plasma level of nilotinib that is sufficient to achieve&#xD;
      adequate clinical response while not generating major adverse events could be elucidated by&#xD;
      the analysis of combined clinical and pharmacokinetic data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ENESTKorea is a phase 4, multi-institutional, single-arm, open-label study investigating the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of nilotinib at the currently approved dose (300 mg twice daily), in&#xD;
      adult patients diagnosed as Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive chronic myeloid leukemia in&#xD;
      chronic phase (CML-CP). Plasma samples are collected every three months, for up to 12 months,&#xD;
      to determine plasma nilotinib concentrations (PNCs). The primary endpoint is the cumulative&#xD;
      rate of molecular response 4.5 (MR4.5; BCR-ABL1IS ≤ 0.0032%) by 24 months. Secondary&#xD;
      endpoints include the cumulative rates of MR3 (BCR-ABLIS ≤ 0.1%) and MR4 (BCR-ABLIS ≤ 0.01%)&#xD;
      by 12 and 24 months; time to MR3, MR4, and MR4.5; progression-free survival (PFS); overall&#xD;
      survival (OS). Correlations between PNCs and clinical outcomes are also analyzed.&#xD;
