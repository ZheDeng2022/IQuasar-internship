      This research targets four anti-infectives commonly prescribed in intensive care:&#xD;
      ceftazidime, cefepime, cefotaxime and meropenem, used for severe infections For patient&#xD;
      hospitalized in intensive care unit , there is little or no pharmacokinetic data for these&#xD;
      four molecules.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Antibiotics, and especially beta-lactams, are among the most used drugs in the world. The&#xD;
      good use of antibiotics and the prevention of selection of resistant strains has been a&#xD;
      public health priority for many years. In this context, it is essential to obtain effective&#xD;
      antibiotic concentrations at the site of infection. In order to obtain effective&#xD;
      concentrations, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefotaxime, piperacillin and meropenem are&#xD;
      administered in this population by continuous infusion at high dose. Although beta-lactams&#xD;
      are mostly well tolerated, they can cause adverse effects such as severe neurological&#xD;
      toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The critically ill patient has physiological alterations that can significantly alter the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of drugs. Several studies have clearly shown that the pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      beta-lactams in the critically ill patient is different from those of other patients.&#xD;
      Depending on the clinical context and the co-morbidities of the patient, sub-therapeutic or&#xD;
      potentially toxic concentrations can be observed for the same dosage. The risk of ineffective&#xD;
      treatment and the development of resistance remains, despite the high doses administered. In&#xD;
      addition, this pharmacokinetic variability may be responsible for the observation of toxic&#xD;
      concentrations and the occurrence of adverse effects in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following these arguments, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of beta-lactams accompanied by&#xD;
      personalized dosage adjustment appears to be an essential tool to optimize the management of&#xD;
      critically ill patients. Although strongly recommended, the TDM of beta-lactams in the&#xD;
      critically ill patient accompanied by a dosage adjustment is not currently performed&#xD;
      systematically in all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of the use of a systematic therapeutic&#xD;
      drug monitoring of beta-lactams in the critically ill treated with cefotaxime, ceftazidime,&#xD;
      cefepime, meropenem or piperacillin, in terms of efficacy and prevention of neurotoxicity.&#xD;
