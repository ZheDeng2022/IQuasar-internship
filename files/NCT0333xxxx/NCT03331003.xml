  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current effective therapies of pattern hiar loss are topical minoxidil and oral finasteride.&#xD;
      Finasteride is an inhibitor of type 2 5α-reductase and will cause hypospadias in male infant&#xD;
      if taken or touched by pregnant woman. The effect of minoxidil is still known now but the&#xD;
      dilation of scalp vessel might improve the progression of pattern hair oss. However,&#xD;
      minoxidil is not effective for frontotemporal recession and sometimes cause scalp irritation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) a new therapy to treat alopecia. In 2007, LLLT was approved by&#xD;
      the FDA as a treatment for hair loss. In some small studies, patients had a decrease in the&#xD;
      number of vellus hairs, an increase in the number of terminal hairs, and an increase in shaft&#xD;
      diameter. Up to now, however, no longer, placebo-controlled studies have proved its efficacy&#xD;
      in this application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the mechanism of paradoxical hair growth (PHG), sublethal injury to the hair&#xD;
      follicle could stimulate the hair follicle to enter anagen via the release of factors that&#xD;
      alter angiogenesis, leading to increased blood flow to the dermal papilla. Furthermore, load&#xD;
      inflammation in the papilla nad heat shok response, possibly mediated by HSP27, may play a&#xD;
      role in activation of follicular stem cell.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a randomized, blinded, self-comparison and superior clinical trial design. In&#xD;
      this clinical trial, the investigators try to evaluate the efficacy of low-level laser&#xD;
      therapy in treating pattern hair loss. Pattern hair loss is characterized by increased vellus&#xD;
      hairs and decreased shaft diameter, and these features are improved by LLLT in previous.&#xD;

      This study is A randomized, double-blind, self-comparison, sham device- controlled,&#xD;
      multicenter Trial. Total subjects is 100 and the clinical trial was conducted in National&#xD;
      Taiwan University Hospital and National Taiwan University Hospital-Hsinchu Branch. The study&#xD;
      starts from December 2013 to June 2015 for within 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential subjects will be collected into the clinical study, and have 24 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment. The forth, twelve and twenty-fourth weeks are took as evaluation point. Besides&#xD;
      the photo shooting area, recording the density of hair growth, analyzing of hair growth&#xD;
      number, and the width of hair will be quantified. At the same time, the subject will also&#xD;
      have the safety evaluation to see if there are any reddish or skin disorder(erythema, edema,&#xD;
      dried, skin keratinization) or other systematic symptom. After quantifying the data, the&#xD;
      degree of covered area in target area is seen as primary end point.&#xD;
