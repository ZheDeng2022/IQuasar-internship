    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to identify the clinical characteristics of infantile&#xD;
      hemangioma (IH) in our single center in China. The second objective of the study is to&#xD;
      identify the clinical features of infantile hepatic hemangioma (IHH) and ulceration in&#xD;
      patients with IHs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infantile hemangioma (IH) is the most common benign tumor of infancy with an estimated&#xD;
      prevalence of 4%-5%. IHs may be presented in any part of body including the visceral organs,&#xD;
      but are preferentially located on the face, head and neck area. IHs exhibit a characteristic&#xD;
      life cycle consisting of a rapid proliferating phase within the first year of life followed&#xD;
      by a slowly involuted phase lasting for up to five years. Although most resolve over time&#xD;
      without major sequelae, a significant subset can result in severe complications including&#xD;
      disfiguring and ulceration, some even could impair organ functions and threaten patients'&#xD;
      life. Risk factors of IHs have been identified including multiple gestation, low birth&#xD;
      weight, prematurity, white race, eclampsia and placental abnormalities. However, the exact&#xD;
      occurrence, clinical features and risk factors of IHs is still unknown in Chinese patients&#xD;
      because of the lack of large scale of prospective studies. In addition, characteristics of&#xD;
      ulceration of IHs and infantile hepatic hemangiomas (IHHs) are also not well documented.&#xD;
      Therefore, it's important to perform this prospective study to determine the clinical&#xD;
      features of Chinese patients with IHs, and this study will also make contributions to the&#xD;
      prevents, diagnoses and treatments of IHs.&#xD;
