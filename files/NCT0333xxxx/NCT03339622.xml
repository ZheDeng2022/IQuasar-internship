  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer causes pain in many of the patients that it affects. Physicians specialized in&#xD;
      palliative care help advanced cancer patients to maintain as good pain control as possible&#xD;
      through the use of medications such as opioids. Even with palliative care and optimal use of&#xD;
      medications, many patients still suffer enormously as the cancer spreads. Because of this,&#xD;
      some cancer patients also try or use cannabis in different ways to relieve their pain and&#xD;
      improve the way they feel. However, there has not been much high-quality research done yet to&#xD;
      prove whether or not cannabis products are truly useful to relieve severe cancer pain. This&#xD;
      study is to test if advanced cancer patients who use inhaled medical cannabis (PPP001), in&#xD;
      addition to palliative care management, will experience improvement in quality of life and&#xD;
      relieve uncontrolled pain, providing safety conditions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 4-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group design trial to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of inhaled PPP001 to improve quality of life (HRQoL) and&#xD;
      reduce pain intensity, in patients with uncontrolled cancer pain and incurable malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nine hundred forty six adult patients, male and female, with chronic cancer pain (at least 3&#xD;
      months in duration) and advanced disease, with an average weekly pain intensity score greater&#xD;
      than 4 on a 11 points Numerical Rate Scale (NRS), will be prospectively recruited and invited&#xD;
      to participate in this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent will be obtained by a Research Assistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After baseline documentation with standardized scales, patients will be randomized to one of&#xD;
      2 parallel groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: 4 weeks PPP001-kit three times daily; Group B: 4 weeks placebo-kit three times&#xD;
      daily; The inhalation of PPP001 or placebo-kit will be allowed three times a day at 4-6 hour&#xD;
      intervals. Rescue medication will also be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have a dose titration phase during the first week, followed by an additional&#xD;
      3-week period of treatment. The dose escalation will allow patients to adapt to the potential&#xD;
      AEs of cannabis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have follow-up after 1 week and 4 weeks of treatment. Once the patient has&#xD;
      completed 4 weeks of inhaled PPP001 or placebo, it will be rolled into a long-term follow-up&#xD;
      phase until drop-out or death. All patients, including the ones in the placebo group, will be&#xD;
      allowed to receive the active treatment once the 4-weeks trial has finished, and continue it&#xD;
      until death or drop-out.&#xD;
