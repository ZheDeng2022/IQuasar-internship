  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this long-term follow-up (LTFU) study is to evaluate the incidence of the&#xD;
      clinical diagnosis of asthma and the frequency of wheezing in infants and children with&#xD;
      respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection who were treated with (lumicitabine or placebo)&#xD;
      and have completed their last planned study-related visit in a feeding Phase 2 study&#xD;
      (64041575RSV2004).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      RSV is a leading cause of lower respiratory tract disease in infants. The primary hypothesis&#xD;
      is that treatment of RSV-infected infants/children with lumicitabine (also known as&#xD;
      JNJ-64041575 or ALS-008176) will decrease subsequent wheezing/asthma compared to placebo&#xD;
      (looks like lumicitabine). The participants who have completed treatment course&#xD;
      (lumicitabine/placebo) and last study visit in a previous study, 64041575RSV2004, for the&#xD;
      treatment of RSV infection will be enrolled in this LTFU study. The main purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to understand the impact of lumicitabine on the occurrence of asthma/wheezing in&#xD;
      infants/children with a history of RSV infection. The participants will be assessed via&#xD;
      monthly calls with the parents/caregivers and also at site visits at 3, 6,12 and 24 months.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Wheezing Days in Participants Within the First 2 Years After RSV Infection</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of wheezing days in participants within the first 2 Years after RSV infection based on information reported by the parent/caregiver were reported. Percentage of wheezing days was calculated by (number of wheezing days/days of study completion - day of informed consent + 1)*100.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Wheezing Days in Participants Per Month After RSV Infection</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of wheezing days in participants per month after RSV infection based on information reported by the parent/caregiver were reported. Percentage of wheezing days per month was calculated by number of days reported in that period with wheezing, using last day - first day + 1 for reported days of wheezing and multiplied by 100%.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Reportable Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants with reportable AEs were reported. The following AEs were considered reportable (within the context of this study): respiratory illness AEs, including subsequent RSV infections, adverse events considered at least possibly related to study treatment (lumicitabine or placebo, as received in study 64041575RSV2004), and serious adverse events.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>SAE is any AE that results in: death, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, is life-threatening experience, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect and may jeopardize participant and/or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.</description>
