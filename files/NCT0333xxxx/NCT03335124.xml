  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The global burden of sepsis is substantial with an estimated 15 to 19 million cases per year;&#xD;
      the vast majority of these cases occur in low income countries. New therapeutic approaches to&#xD;
      sepsis are desperately required; considering the global burden of sepsis these interventions&#xD;
      should be effective, cheap, safe and readily available. The aim is to study the synergistic&#xD;
      effect of vitamin C, hydrocortisone and thiamine on survival in patients with severe sepsis&#xD;
      and septic shock.&#xD;

      AIM OF THE STUDY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal is to determine the effects on clinical course and outcome of patients with severe&#xD;
      sepsis and septic shock treated with vitamin C, hydrocortisone and thiamine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in the intensive care unit of Department of Gastroenterology,&#xD;
      University Medical Center (UMC) Ljubljana. All of the patients with severe sepsis and septic&#xD;
      shock admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) in the past 12 hours will be screened for&#xD;
      possible inclusion in the study. The diagnosis of severe sepsis and septic shock will be&#xD;
      based on the 1992 American College of Chest Physicians/Society of Critical Care Medicine&#xD;
      Consensus Conference definitions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PLAN OF THE STUDY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After determining the eligibility for inclusion in our study, the investigators will acquire&#xD;
      the written consent from the patient or relatives. The investigators (doctor on call) will&#xD;
      randomize the patient either in the treatment or placebo group. The randomization will be&#xD;
      done before-hand with the online tool Research Randomizer. After acquiring the randomized&#xD;
      numbers, they will be placed in sealed envelopes. These envelopes will be available to the&#xD;
      on-call doctor. The envelopes will then be sent to our outpatient clinic, where the studied&#xD;
      substances will be mixed by a nurse, that will have no contact with the patients or the ICU&#xD;
      staff. The substances will be marked with Vitamin C, Thiamine and Hydrocortisone, regardless&#xD;
      if normal saline or the actual substances are inside the vials. Only this nurse will have the&#xD;
      data regarding the contents of the vials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on literature the investigators expect that survival and clinical course in sepsis and&#xD;
      septic shock is correlated with fluid resuscitation and vasopressor use. Because of this, all&#xD;
      of the included patients will be monitored with invasive hemodynamic monitoring (All of the&#xD;
      patients will be monitored with the Edwards EV 1000 monitors).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the patients will be treated the same as per internationally recognized guidelines for&#xD;
      treatment of septic shock. While the use of corticosteroids in severe sepsis is off-label,&#xD;
      the patients will be informed of possible side-effects. This fact will also be written in the&#xD;
      consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neither the patients or the relatives will receive no financial compensation for study&#xD;
      inclusion. During the hospitalization, the patients will receive three different substances&#xD;
      in dosages, that are non toxic. During the study, there will be intermittent statistical&#xD;
      analysis, and if increased mortality or severe side effects will be found then the study will&#xD;
      be terminated. The confidentiality of personal data will be protected accordingly with the&#xD;
      rules and laws of patient's privacy. The identity of patients will not be disclosed. The data&#xD;
      acquired during the study will be available to the study participant. The anticipated costs&#xD;
      will be covered by the Department of Gastroenterology, UMC Ljubljana. No financial&#xD;
      compensation will be given to researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study the following data will be acquired from the patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Age,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Sex,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Body weight,&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Admitting diagnosis and source of infection,&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Isolated pathogens,&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Comorbidities,&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. The need for mechanical ventilation,&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. The use of vasopressors (all doses will be converted to Norepinephrine equivalents),&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. The duration of vasoactive therapy,&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Daily urine output,&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Fluid balance after 24 and 72 hours,&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. The presence of acute kidney failure&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. Duration of ICU stay and hospital stay,&#xD;
&#xD;
       14. Survival in ICU, hospital, after 28 and 60 days&#xD;
&#xD;
       15. Routine blood test for the first 4 days, a. creatinine b. White Blood Cells (WBC) c.&#xD;
           Platelets d. Bilirubin e. Partial Pressure of Oxygen in Arterial Blood/Fraction of&#xD;
           Inspired Oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) ratio e. procalcitonin (PCT) and procalcitonin clearance f.&#xD;
           lactate g. blood samples will be stored for possible additional analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients' admission Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II and APACHE&#xD;
      IV scores will be recorded. The APACHE IV score allows calculation of the predicted hospital&#xD;
      mortality and predicted ICU length of stay (LOS). The daily Sepsis-related Organ Failure&#xD;
      Assessment (SOFA) score will be recorded for the first 4 treatment days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary statistics will be used to describe the clinical data and presented as mean Â±&#xD;
      standard deviation (SD), median with interquartile range (IQR) or percentages as appropriate.&#xD;
      Chi squared analysis with Fisher's exact test (when appropriate) and Student's t test (Mann&#xD;
      Whitney U test for non-normal distributions) were used to compare data between the active&#xD;
      treatment group and the placebo group with statistical significance declared for probability&#xD;
      values of 0.05 or less.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Safety &amp; storage:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main risk to subjects is the accidental release of Protected Health Information (PHI).&#xD;
      Careful record management methods will be in place to ensure this type of privacy breach does&#xD;
      not occur. The data set will be kept in a password-protected file and stored separately from&#xD;
      the subject identification (ID) key in the locked office of the principal investigator. Only&#xD;
      the research team will have access to this information, and will not disclose this&#xD;
      information to any other person or entity. Three years after the completion of the study, all&#xD;
      collected data will be destroyed by permanently deleting electronic copies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPECTED RESULTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect a faster recovery, shorter hospitalization, shorter use of&#xD;
      vasoactive drugs and better survival in treatment group versus (vs.) control group.&#xD;
