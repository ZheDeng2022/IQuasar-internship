  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer (CAP) is one of the most common malignancies in men, both in Western&#xD;
      countries and developing countries. Radiation therapy (RT) is an important therapeutic&#xD;
      option. New technologies (3D, IMRT, IGRT, VMAT) have been introduced in the last decades,&#xD;
      with a progressive improvement of clinical outcome. However, in many countries the only&#xD;
      treatment option is the traditional 2D technique based on standard simulation. The&#xD;
      indications for field definition in this treatment are still based on expert's opinions. The&#xD;
      aim of this analysis is to propose new indications for 2D fields definition based on&#xD;
      three-dimensional simulation in a population of patients with CAP. Twenty patients with CAP&#xD;
      consecutively treated with RT in our center were identified. Patients underwent CT-simulation&#xD;
      in supine position. Pelvic MRI images were fused with CT-simulation images. In this way,&#xD;
      delineation of the prostate and seminal vesicles was performed on MRI images. Clinical Target&#xD;
      Volume definition (CTV) was performed according to EORTC guidelines simulating 4 different&#xD;
      categories: low-risk CAP, intermediate-risk CAP, high-risk CAP without involvement of the&#xD;
      seminal vesicles, and high-risk CAP with involvement of seminal vesicles. The Planning Target&#xD;
      Volume (PTV) was defined by adding a margin of 10 mm to the CTV in all directions. For each&#xD;
      patient, 8 treatment plans were calculated. In particular, for each of the 4 categories of&#xD;
      risk, 2 treatment plans were calculated by using a cobalt source or 10 MV photons. Treatment&#xD;
      plans were calculated using the box technique. Progressive optimization was realized with an&#xD;
      iterative procedure by evaluating the three-dimensional dose distribution. Once the final&#xD;
      plan was achieved (respecting the PTV constraint: D98 &gt; 95%), distances of the fields edges&#xD;
      from a set of reference points were measured.&#xD;
