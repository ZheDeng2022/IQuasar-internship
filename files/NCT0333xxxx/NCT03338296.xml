        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy male or female adolescents, age 12 to 17 years (inclusive) at Screening, with&#xD;
             a BMI that is greater than or equal to the United States-weighted mean of the 95th&#xD;
             percentile based on age and sex with a body weight greater than 60 kilograms (kg).&#xD;
             Participants with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) may have a pre-existing or new&#xD;
             diagnosis of T2DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants with pre-existing T2DM should have prior documentation consistent with the&#xD;
        diagnosis and/or be on active pharmacotherapy for T2DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants with a new diagnosis of T2DM (ie, diagnosed at Screening) should be based on&#xD;
        the 2016 American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines. The diagnostic criteria are met if&#xD;
        a participant has unequivocal hyperglycemia (random plasma glucose ≥200 milligrams per&#xD;
        deciliter (mg/dL) (11.1 millimoles per liter [mmol/L]) with classic symptoms of&#xD;
        hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis) OR any of the following criteria are observed and&#xD;
        confirmed:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HbA1c ≥6.5%&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  fasting plasma glucose (FPG) ≥126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  2-hour plasma glucose ≥200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) by an oral glucose tolerance test&#xD;
             (OGTT) All T2DM participants must have an HbA1c &lt;10% at Screening. If participants are&#xD;
             being or need to be treated with antidiabetic agents, the T2DM treatment regimen must&#xD;
             be stable for at least 3 months before randomization. A single rescreen is allowed&#xD;
             following stabilization. Stable control refers to minimal dose changes to existing&#xD;
             medications for glycemic control and no medications being initiated for glycemic&#xD;
             control in the 3 months before randomization. Minimal changes are defined as a change&#xD;
             without any change in dose frequency, no add-on or discontinuation of other&#xD;
             antidiabetic agents and the participant has not been hospitalized due to hypo- or&#xD;
             hyperglycemic events.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants and their families not planning to move away from the area for the&#xD;
                  duration of the study&#xD;

&#xD;
                    -  Able and willing to support and supervise study participation in the opinion&#xD;
                       of the investigator, including consideration of any existing physical,&#xD;
                       medical, or mental condition that prevents compliance with the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Able and willing to personally comply with and execute all aspects of the&#xD;
                       study requirements for the caregivers or guardians&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant new illness within 1 month before randomization that may affect&#xD;

                  meters per second [m/s], mean gradient &gt;25 millimeters of mercury [mmHg], and&#xD;
                  aortic valve area &lt;1.5 centimeters squared [cm^2]; mitral stenosis: mean gradient&#xD;
                  &gt;5 mmHg and mitral valve area &lt;1.5 cm^2)&#xD;

                  not measurable due to lack of adequate TR jet, the pulmonary flow acceleration&#xD;
                  time measured at the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOTAT) will be used to&#xD;
                  assess eligibility. Participants with a RVOTAT ≤100 milliseconds (msec) will be&#xD;
                  excluded, suggesting an elevated mean SPAP; eligibility for the those&#xD;
                  participants with RVOTAT between 100 and 120 msec will be determined based on&#xD;
                  combined assessment of the TR jet, septal motion, and right ventricular size.&#xD;

                  agree to use the same contraceptive during the study and for 28 days after study&#xD;
                  drug discontinuation (Note: All female participants will be considered to be of&#xD;
                  childbearing potential unless they have been sterilized surgically [ie, bilateral&#xD;
                  tubal ligation, total hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy, all with surgery&#xD;

        <title>Change in Fasting Lipid Profile (Total Cholesterol, Low-density Lipoprotein [LDL] Cholesterol, High-density Lipoprotein [HDL] Cholesterol, Triglycerides) From Baseline up to Week 52</title>
        <description>Total Cholesterol is a measure of the total amount of cholesterol in blood. It includes both LDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol. LDL cholesterol is often called the &quot;bad&quot; cholesterol because it collects in the walls of blood vessels, raising chances of health problems like a heart attack or stroke. HDL cholesterol is known as the &quot;good&quot; cholesterol because it helps remove other forms of cholesterol from bloodstream. Triglycerides are the most common type of fat in the body.</description>
