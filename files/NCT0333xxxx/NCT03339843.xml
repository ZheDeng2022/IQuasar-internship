  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Open-label, phase II, basket trial. This trial is a screening program for abemaciclib&#xD;
      efficacy in multiple platinum-resistant tumour types by using metabolic imaging (PERCIST) and&#xD;
      RECIST v1.1 criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the rate of FDG-avidity and the absence of deactivation of the Rb gene function in&#xD;
      more than 95% of cases, we propose to define 5 tumour types of interest in a preliminary&#xD;
      stage:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Platinum-refractory esophageal adenocarcinoma (ADC)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Platinum-refractory esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Platinum-refractory cholangiocarcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Platinum-refractory and progressive after immunotherapy urothelial cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Platinum-refractory endometrial cancer&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In various solid tumour types FDG-PET/CT has been shown to identify treatment-refractory&#xD;
      diseases with a high negative predictive value (NPV) through a whole-body quantitative&#xD;
      assessment of treatment-induced changes in tumour glucose uptake soon after treatment&#xD;
      initiation, before any structural changes are observed. Progress in the standardisation of&#xD;
      FDG-PET/CT imaging and response analysis now allow its use in multicentric trials opening the&#xD;
      possibilities for trials where treatment allocation will be based on early metabolic&#xD;
      response. MiMe has been built on the assumption that a medication which does not induce any&#xD;
      metabolic changes in a given clinical setting is unlikely to induce a significant benefit and&#xD;
      does consequently not deserve further investigation as a single agent in this setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MiMe, by assessing metabolic response early during the treatment course, will hopefully&#xD;
      provide useful information about the drug activity in various cancer types, and about&#xD;
      mechanisms of resistance through a potential ambitious translational research program with&#xD;
      serial collection of circulating-tumour DNA (ct-DNA).&#xD;

    <description>This study contains 2 stages; during the 1st stage, a maximum of 17 patients will be enrolled in each tumour type cohort. After 13 evaluable patients have been enrolled, an interim analysis will be performed. If 3 or more patients are seen to have experienced a treatment success, then the cohort will pass into the 2nd stage in which a maximum of 20 more patients are enrolled. If 2 or less patients are seen to have experienced a treatment success, then that cohort will be closed and will not proceed into the 2nd stage.&#xD;
Subjects will receive 200 mg of abemaciclib orally, twice a day, during cycles of 28 days each. The subject will undergo: A baseline FDG-PET/CT and a baseline CT scan and A blinded early FDG-PET/CT at D14 +/- 2 days of study treatment.&#xD;
A treatment success is defined as a patient who has metabolic response according to PERCIST with a response cut off set at 15% at the early FDG-PET/CT and a morphological disease control after 2 cycles measured by RECIST v1.1.</description>
