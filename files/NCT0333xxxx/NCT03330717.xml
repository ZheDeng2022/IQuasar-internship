  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aims of the study are to compare the recovering period between a group of patients with&#xD;
      conventional sedation, a group using hypnosis as sedation during the surgery and a third&#xD;
      group using hypnosis as a relaxation method and preparation but enjoying a classic sedation&#xD;
      for their surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparaison of pain ( different types of pain), consumption of pain killers ,anxiety and&#xD;
      fatigue on day0,1, 8 after surgery and every. 3 months during the first 2 years of follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparisons are also performed in substudies defined by treatments modalités. Inflammatory&#xD;
      parameters s ( CRP_ C reactive protein, NLR- ( neutrophils to lymphocyte ratio) are measured&#xD;
      on Day 0, 1, 8 and also salivary Immunoglobulins and different endocannabinoids.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypnosis has already demonstrated benefits among breast cancer patients undergoing oncologic&#xD;
      surgery. Different side effects were measured during the post operative period and at each&#xD;
      follow up visit by physicians in order to carefully compare side effects in the 3 armes of&#xD;
      patients..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis was that hypnosis sedation generates less perioperative inflammatory reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A substudy of 50 patients was also dedicated to the investigation ofsalivary immunoglobulins&#xD;
      and dosage of differents endocannabinoids&#xD;
