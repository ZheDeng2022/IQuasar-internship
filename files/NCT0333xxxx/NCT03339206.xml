      This study will assess the impact of cigarette constituent messages with and without FDA&#xD;
      source and quit information in a randomized controlled trial. The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that cigarette constituent messages will increase intention to quit compared to messages&#xD;
      about littering cigarettes (the control). The investigators also hypothesize that constituent&#xD;
      messages that include FDA source and quit information will increase intention to quit&#xD;
      compared to messages without that information.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act delegates the U.S. Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) to communicate the risks of smoking to the public, among other tobacco&#xD;
      regulatory responsibilities. Little research exists about how FDA, as a regulatory agency,&#xD;
      should develop and deliver these messages, and whether they should include their source&#xD;
      information on the ads. This study will assess the impact of cigarette constituent messages&#xD;
      with and without FDA source and quit information in a randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: People interested in participating will complete an online screener. Study staff&#xD;
      will invite people eligible based on the screener to enroll in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed Consent: The consent form will be shared with people who are eligible based on the&#xD;
      screener in the invitation email. At the beginning of the baseline survey, participants will&#xD;
      again review the consent form and will be asked to provide consent in order to enroll in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: At the end of the baseline survey, survey software will randomly assign&#xD;
      participants to one of the three study arms. Participants will have an equal chance of being&#xD;
      randomized to each study arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment: Participants will complete 18 computer based surveys during the study. The first&#xD;
      baseline survey will take around 20 minutes to complete on day 0. Participants will then&#xD;
      receive a survey each morning for days 1-15 that will include behavior measures as well as&#xD;
      their assigned study intervention. These surveys will take approximately 5 minutes to&#xD;
      complete. Participants will then complete a 20-minute survey on day 16, and day 32.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed description of the intervention: Participants will receive an email with a link to a&#xD;
      survey each morning for 15 days. During that survey they will be shown one message from their&#xD;
      condition. Each condition has 5 messages that will be repeated 3 times in a counterbalanced&#xD;
      order. Study investigators designed the messages.&#xD;

          <description>Measured by survey. Response efficacy measured with 1 question, on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 indicates low response efficacy of quitting, and 5 indicates a high response efficacy of quitting smoking cigarettes.</description>
          <population>Overall number of participants analyzed is the number of participants in each condition that responded to the outcome measure for at least one time point. Participants who responded to the measure at the time point of interest are included in the row for that time point, but participants that did not are excluded for that day.</population>
