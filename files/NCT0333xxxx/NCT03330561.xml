  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A multi center, open-label, Phase 1 dose escalation study with expansion cohort is designed&#xD;
      to determine the MTD, RP2D and dosing schedule of PRS-343 in patients with HER2+ advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic solid tumors.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate PRS-343 administered by intravenous (IV) infusion every 3 weeks&#xD;
      (Schedule 1) initially. If safety, PK, and PD data suggest a different dosing schedule should&#xD;
      be evaluated, Schedule 2 and/or 3 (dosing every 2 weeks in a 28-day cycle or once a week in a&#xD;
      21-day cycle, respectively) may be conducted. Separate MTDs may be determined for each&#xD;
      schedule evaluated. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) will be reported during the first cycle&#xD;
      of each schedule (e.g., 21 days after the first dose in Cycle 1 for Schedule 1). Patients&#xD;
      will be monitored for safety throughout the study. Dosing will continue until criteria for&#xD;
      study drug discontinuation are met (disease progression or withdrawal from the study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with unknown HER2 status will be consented separately in a pre-screening visit in&#xD;
      order to undergo HER2 testing prior to screening. All patients will be evaluated at screening&#xD;
      (Day 28 to 1) and baseline (Day 1 predose).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the MTD has been established, up to 30 additional patients with locally advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic HER2+ solid tumors considered likely to respond to a HER2 targeted CD137 agonist&#xD;
      (e.g. gastric/gastroesophageal/esophageal, breast, bladder) may be enrolled in individual&#xD;
      expansion cohorts. The expansion cohort will be enrolled at the MTD and/or at a lower dose&#xD;
      level if safety/PD/PK/efficacy data support further evaluation of a lower dose level in order&#xD;
      to determine the RP2D. The RP2D may be equivalent to or lower than the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An End-of-Treatment Visit will be performed at the time of treatment discontinuation.&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated 30 days after the End-of-Treatment Visit or prior to starting&#xD;
      subsequent therapy, if sooner, at the Safety Follow-up Visit to assess any ongoing AEs as&#xD;
      outlined in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obinutuzumab pre-treatment cohorts: The potential of obinutuzumab pre-treatment to reduce&#xD;
      formation of ADA will be studied in a cohort of up to ten patients receiving PRS-343 at a&#xD;
      dose of 8 mg/kg Q2 weeks (corresponding to Cohort 11b).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assessed for tumor response/progression per RECIST v1.1&#xD;

        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Known uncontrolled central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous&#xD;
             meningitis. Note: Patients with previously treated brain metastases may participate&#xD;
             provided they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least 4&#xD;

             and/or pertuzumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Medical, psychiatric, cognitive or other conditions that compromise the patient's&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Any severe concurrent disease or condition (includes active infections, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, interstitial lung disease) that in the judgment of the investigator would&#xD;
             make study participation inappropriate for the patient.&#xD;

             hepatitis C infection. Patients with positive hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb)&#xD;
             require assessment and monitoring of virus deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) status;&#xD;
             patients with positive hepatitis C virus (HCV) core antibody can enroll if HCV&#xD;
             ribonucleic acid (RNA) is negative. Patients with latent or active hepatitis B&#xD;
             infection are excluded from the pre-treatment Cohort receiving obinutuzumab.&#xD;

             immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study treatment&#xD;
             (Note: topical, inhaled, nasal and ophthalmic steroids are not prohibited). This&#xD;
             criterion does not apply to patients receiving obinutuzumab as pre-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past (i.e., with use of&#xD;
             disease-modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement&#xD;
             therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy&#xD;
             for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Has not recovered from the adverse effect of previous anticancer treatments to&#xD;
             pre-treatment baseline or Grade 1 except for alopecia, anemia (hemoglobin must meet&#xD;

             been exhausted.&#xD;

             non-melanomatous skin cancer, 2) curatively treated cervical or breast carcinoma in&#xD;

             dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Receipt of cytotoxic chemotherapy within 3 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas and&#xD;
             mitomycin C) of scheduled C1D1 dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Receipt of radiation therapy within 3 weeks of scheduled C1D1 dosing, unless the&#xD;
             radiation comprised a limited field to non-visceral structures (e.g., limb bone&#xD;
             metastasis).&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Receipt of treatment with immunotherapy, biological therapies, targeted small&#xD;
             molecules, hormonal therapies within 3 weeks of scheduled C1D1 dosing.&#xD;
