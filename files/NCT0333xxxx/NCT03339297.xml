    <description>Disease relapse was defined by either morphological evidence of acute leukemia or Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) consistent with pre-transplant features, documented or not by biopsy. The event was defined as an increase in size of prior sites of disease or evidence of new sites of disease, documented or not by biopsy. Disease relapse was diagnosed when there was morphological or clinical evidence of the following: reappearance of leukemia blast cells in the peripheral blood, or &gt;5% blasts in the bone marrow (BM), not attributable to another cause (eg, BM regeneration), or the appearance of previous or new dysplastic changes (MDS specific) within the BM, with or without falling donor chimerism, or the development of extramedullary leukemia or leukemic cells in the cerebral spinal fluid, or institution of therapy to treat relapsed disease, including donor lymphocyte infusion.</description>

        <title>Cumulative Incidence Percentage of Systemic Steroids for the Treatment of aGvHD +180 Days Post-HSCT</title>
        <description>For each treatment arm, the cumulative incidence rate of systemic steroid use for the treatment of aGvHD by Day +180 post-HSCT will be estimated using the cumulative incidence competing risk estimator. The calculation of the cumulative incidence rates and the stratified Gray's test was carried out using the LIFETEST procedure in SAS version 9.4. If the participant experienced a competing risk event, then the initiation date was used to calculate the time-to-event variable.</description>

        <description>The 5-Level EuroQol-5D health questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) index value, which is country-specific, was only performed for participants in the US. The EQ-5D-5L is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health outcome that includes a descriptive system consisting of 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). Change from the baseline assessment to Days +100 and +180 post-HSCT in the index value was assessed. The index value total range is from a minimum value of -1 to a maximum value of +1. A higher EQ-5D-5L index value represents better quality of life (QoL), thus a positive change in the index value represents improved QoL.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Days +100 and +180 Post-HSCT in Participant Reported Outcomes as Measured Based on the EQ Visual Analog Scale (EQ VAS)</title>
        <description>The EQ VAS score at baseline and each of the post-HSCT assessments was summarized and presented using descriptive statistics. A higher EQ VAS score represents better QoL. For each of the post-HSCT assessments, change between baseline and that assessment in the EQ VAS score was calculated similarly to the EQ-5D-5L index value for a specific participant and was summarized and presented using descriptive statistics. The score ranges from a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 100. A negative change in the score indicates a decrease in quality of life.</description>

        <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health outcome that includes a descriptive system consisting of 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). For each of the 5 dimensions based on the descriptive system of the EQ-5D-5L, the numbers of participants for all categories (the 5 levels of reported problems) were assessed. For Day +100 Post-HSCT change between baseline in each dimension will be categorized as follows for a specific participant: Condition improved, if the reported level of problem is lower at that assessment than at baseline; Condition unchanged, if the reported level of problem remains the same; Condition deteriorated, if the reported level of problem is higher at that assessment than at baseline; Unknown, if the reported level of problem is not completed or missing either at baseline or at that assessment.</description>

        <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health outcome that includes a descriptive system consisting of 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). For each of the 5 dimensions based on the descriptive system of the EQ-5D-5L, the numbers of participants for all categories (the 5 levels of reported problems) were assessed. For Day +180 Post-HSCT change between baseline in each dimension will be categorized as follows for a specific participant: Condition improved, if the reported level of problem is lower at that assessment than at baseline; Condition unchanged, if the reported level of problem remains the same; Condition deteriorated, if the reported level of problem is higher at that assessment than at baseline; Unknown, if the reported level of problem is not completed or missing either at baseline or at that assessment.</description>

For each of the 5 dimensions based on the descriptive system of the EQ-5D-5L, the numbers of participants for all categories (the 5 levels of reported problems) were assessed. For Day +100 Post-HSCT change between baseline in each dimension will be categorized as follows for a specific participant: Condition improved, if the reported level of problem is lower at that assessment than at baseline; Condition unchanged, if the reported level of problem remains the same; Condition deteriorated, if the reported level of problem is higher at that assessment than at baseline; Unknown, if the reported level of problem is not completed or missing either at baseline or at that assessment.</description>
