  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the respective roles of aging and schizophrenia in&#xD;
      the regulation of metamemory using a generation strategy. 4 groups will be necessary to&#xD;
      comparison:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult patients (18-45 years) Adult controls (18-45 years) Aged patients (≥ 59.5 years) Aged&#xD;
      controls (≥ 59.5 years)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effects of age and the disease could lead to interaction in regulating metamemory. The&#xD;
      effect of age would be aggravated by the disease.&#xD;

      Metamemory measurement&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective: Measurement of monitoring and control capabilities, and relations between&#xD;
           these two abilities when learning of word pairs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Description: The hardware consists of two lists of 30 pairs of French words, each pair&#xD;
           of words being composed of a word index and a target word (names of concrete objects).&#xD;
           Among the 60 word pairs, 30 are strongly associated items (or easy items, the other 30&#xD;
           being weakly associated or difficult items.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In front of a computer screen, each participant is subjected to a learning test in which 30&#xD;
      pairs of words appear one by one on the screen. Participants have the option to control the&#xD;
      time of presentation of each pair of words. After a retention time of 4 minutes of&#xD;
      information devoted to nonverbal distractive task, follows an evaluation phase of deferred&#xD;
      judgments of learning (JOL time), where for each pair of words studied, the word index is&#xD;
      presented without the target word. Participants must then assess a learning judgment for each&#xD;
      pair of words, that is to say they have to estimate, on a 5-point scale, their ability to&#xD;
      remember later the target word in the presentation the index word. This JOL assessment phase&#xD;
      is immediately followed by cued recall test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the second learning test (30 other word pair), the steps are identical. Prior to this&#xD;
      second learning, generating instruction of a pair of words to learn is proposed: a word index&#xD;
      is presented to the participants who have to generate a pair with a target word. Participants&#xD;
      are trained on 5 pairs of words.&#xD;
