  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The meeting point of the patient and his/her immediate family with the health care system is&#xD;
      complicated and traumatic. While having to deal with medicalization geared towards providing&#xD;
      evidence-based and cost-effective medical care, the patient expects comprehensive, holistic&#xD;
      care tailored to his/her needs, during hospitalization or in the community. A survey of 800&#xD;
      stroke patients and their caregiver during the 1st year following acute stroke&#xD;
      hospitalization will explore their unmet needs.&#xD;

      Background: The meeting point of the patient with the health care system is complicated and&#xD;
      traumatic. The patient's autonomy over physical health becomes diminished. The patient and&#xD;
      his family need to deal with medicalization geared towards providing evidence-based medical&#xD;
      care, while attempting to be cost-efficient. The patient expects comprehensive, holistic care&#xD;
      tailored to his/her needs, during hospitalization or in the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To characterize the patient's and his/her family's needs and expectations from&#xD;
      the medical system, following an acute medical event involving hospitalization and community&#xD;
      care treatment; to analyze the gaps between these needs and the actual treatment provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Working hypotheses: Certain needs and expectations of patients and their families are&#xD;
      unrecognized and unmet by the medical system; more deprived population groups can be&#xD;
      identified, where the gap between needs and service provided is exceptionally great.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of research and methods of data collection: Prospective cohort study. Method(s) of data&#xD;
      collection: 800 stroke patients hospitalized at 4 medical centers: Tel Hashomer, Soroka,&#xD;
      Asaf-Harofeh, and Naharia, and a close family member (caregiver), will be recruited during&#xD;
      one calendar year. These medical centers reflect the heterogeneity of the population, it's&#xD;
      ethnic diversity, and the periphery vs. the central areas of the country of Israel. Personal&#xD;
      details will be recorded, and informed consent forms signed. The patients will be&#xD;
      telephone-interviewed 3-4 months after acute hospitalization, 6-8 months, and after one year,&#xD;
      to assess their functionality, coping with bureaucracy, availability and accessibility&#xD;
      (financial and cultural), disease management, continuity of treatment, number of caregivers,&#xD;
      quality of life, depression, cognitive function, care received by the medical system,&#xD;
      &quot;patient at the center&quot; assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uniqueness and relevance to the National health Insurance Law: Assessment of patient's&#xD;
      experience (and his caregivers) in the first year after hospitalization due to stroke, with&#xD;
      emphasis on inequality between patients based on socio-economic factors. The assumption is&#xD;
      that the gap between expectations and needs of patient and family from the medical system and&#xD;
      actual service provided by the system is even bigger among populations who depend more on the&#xD;
      system for support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the Ministry of Health's 6 pillars of health is reinforcement of the perception of&#xD;
      &quot;patient-centered care&quot; which aims to map out gaps, reasons and challenges in putting this&#xD;
      objective into practice. Findings of this research will enable decision makers to efficiently&#xD;
      allocate resources and funds to needy populations, thus reducing gaps, lowering use of the&#xD;
      medical system and lowering costs incurred by the system.&#xD;
