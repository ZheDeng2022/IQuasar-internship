    <textblock>
      Female survivors of domestic violence (DV) may exhibit various mental health problems. A&#xD;
      variety of psychotherapies are available to improve their mental health, however there is&#xD;
      uncertainty on which is the best. In Colombian, national guidelines do not mention which&#xD;
      therapy should be used and in practice, psychologists use their preferred approaches. Due to&#xD;
      the shortage of psychotherapy appointments, patients wait a long time to initiate treatment&#xD;
      and for each subsequent appointment. Furthermore, patients with mental health problems often&#xD;
      fail to attend their appointments and often drop-out of their psychotherapy. This study will&#xD;
      offer an alternative intervention that is hypothesized to be superior to normal patient care&#xD;
      in Colombia. It will be conducted in Cali and Tuluá, which have high levels of DV, internally&#xD;
      displaced conflict victims and large socioeconomic inequalities. Psychologists and trained&#xD;
      Lay Psychosocial Community Workers (LPCWs) will work together to provide a&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral intervention (CBI) for female survivors of DV, which is a therapy that&#xD;
      aims to change the way people think and behave. Each woman will be offered 11 weekly sessions&#xD;
      which will be shared between a psychologist and a LPCW. The LPCW will assign tasks to the&#xD;
      patients which have been set by the psychologist and will assist participants to attend their&#xD;
      appointments. The study´s hypothesis is: 1) A psychologist led CBI with LPCW support is&#xD;
      superior to standard psychotherapy care in Colombian health services to improve mental health&#xD;
      symptoms of female survivors of DV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited from health services and will be randomly assigned to either the&#xD;
      standard psychotherapy or the CBI with LPCW support (intervention group). In the standard&#xD;
      psychotherapy group, patients will receive psychotherapy approximately every four weeks,&#xD;
      depending on demand, and will have as many sessions as they require. In the intervention&#xD;
      group, patients will be offered eleven weekly CBI sessions. Mental health questionnaires will&#xD;
      be used to measure the study participants' mental health symptoms, their functionality,&#xD;
      experience of DV and other forms of violence. In the intervention group, these questionnaires&#xD;
      will be applied before initiating psychotherapy, two weeks and six months after completing&#xD;
      their psychotherapy. Patients in the control group will have questionnaires applied before&#xD;
      commencing psychotherapy and fourteen weeks and twenty-two weeks after starting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a complex problem because it is associated with factors at&#xD;
      a variety of levels which include the individual, conjugal, societal, cultural, and&#xD;
      institutional, which can all also act as barriers to accessing mental health services.&#xD;
      Survivors of IPV are vulnerable to an array of mental health illnesses which include&#xD;
      post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, emotional dependency and low&#xD;
      self-esteem. A variety of psychotherapies are available to improve mental illnesses, however&#xD;
      there is uncertainty on which is the superior approach. In Colombia there are no national&#xD;
      guidelines outlining which therapy should be used, rather, psychologists use their preferred&#xD;
      approach or approaches which may include humanistic or psychoanalytical methods. Furthermore,&#xD;
      patients with mental health problems face a large waiting list for initial and follow-up&#xD;
      psychotherapy appointments, often fail to attend and do not complete their treatment. This&#xD;
      study will be conducted in two cities, Cali and Tuluá, in the state Valle del Cauca that have&#xD;
      high levels of IPV, internally displaced conflict victims and large socioeconomic&#xD;
      inequalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study´s hypothesis is that a psychologist led cognitive-behavioral intervention with Lay&#xD;
      Psychosocial Community Worker (LPCW) support is superior to treatment as usual to reduce&#xD;
      mental illness symptoms. The study's objective is to improve mental illness symptoms of&#xD;
      female survivors of IPV through the program IPCCOS, a Cognitive-Behavioral Intervention with&#xD;
      Community Worker Support for Survivors of Intimate Partner Violence (IPCCOS is the&#xD;
      abbreviation for its name in Spanish: Intervención Psicoterapéutico Cognitivo-Conductual con&#xD;
      Apoyo Comunitario para Sobrevivientes de Violencia de Pareja). IPCCOS was developed by the&#xD;
      CISALVA Institute at the Universidad del Valle (Cali), the Universidad Central del Valle del&#xD;
      Cauca UCEVA (Tuluá), with assistance from Heartland Alliance International (HAI) to provide&#xD;
      and test an alternative intervention for female survivors of IPV. Each patient will be&#xD;
      offered 11 weekly psychotherapy sessions which will be divided between a psychologist and a&#xD;
      LPCW. The LPCWs in the study will come from community women groups who are already working in&#xD;
      women´s rights and have exposure to violence against women and the relevant medico-legal&#xD;
      systems. They will receive up to a week of intensive training from study psychologists and a&#xD;
      psychologist from HAI who is trained in cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and has experience&#xD;
      training and supervising LPCWs in other mental health studies in Colombia. Approximately six&#xD;
      weeks after initiating the intervention, LPCWs will receive a further day of training. LPCWs&#xD;
      will assign tasks to patients which have been set by the psychologist and will assist them to&#xD;
      overcome any barriers to attend their appointments. They will be closely supervised by the&#xD;
      psychologist once per week to discuss their patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized control trial study design will be used to compare and evaluate the two groups.&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited from health services if they are found to have experimented IPV in&#xD;
      the last year and will be randomly assigned by block randomization to either treatment as&#xD;
      usual or the IPCCOS (intervention group). Patients will be invited to participate in the&#xD;
      study from three sources:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General physician outpatient appointments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospital data bases. Hospital records will be searched to detect patients that have&#xD;
           experienced IPV and that have not commenced psychotherapy. This will be performed&#xD;
           retrospectively to search for patients that were given this diagnosis of IPV between&#xD;
           January 2017 and September 2017. They will be contacted via phone, given a brief&#xD;
           description of the study and if they are interested in participating, they will be&#xD;
           invited to meet a health professional who will give a more detailed description of the&#xD;
           study and take informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients that are detected to have experienced IPV in the Emergency Department will be&#xD;
           told about the study. They will only be asked to decide on their participation one week&#xD;
           after they have been discharged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the treatment as usual group, patients normally receive psychotherapy every four weeks,&#xD;
      depending on demand. There is no pre-established number of sessions as this depends on the&#xD;
      clinical condition and the patient´s adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the intervention group, patients will be offered eleven weekly cognitive-behavioral&#xD;
      sessions that will be delivered by psychologists and LPCWs. In addition, they will receive&#xD;
      phone calls from LPCWs to remind them of their appointments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sessions will be divided between psychologists and LPCWs in the following scheme:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Psychologist&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Psychologist&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Psychologist&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. LPCW&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. LPCW&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Psychologist&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. LPCW&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. LPCW&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Psychologist&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. LPCW&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Psychologist&#xD;
&#xD;
      LPCWs will meet with psychologists on a weekly basis to discuss their patients and any safety&#xD;
      concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who exhibit severe mental illness symptoms during the intervention such as suicidal&#xD;
      ideation, schizophrenia or bipolar disorder will be referred to the project psychiatrist for&#xD;
      specialist care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An array of instruments will be applied during the study to measure mental illness symptoms,&#xD;
      functionality, IPV experience and other forms of violence. These measures will be taken&#xD;
      immediately before starting psychotherapy and two weeks and six months after completing the&#xD;
      intervention in the intervention group. Patients in the control group will have instruments&#xD;
      applied before commencing psychotherapy and fourteen weeks and twenty-two weeks after&#xD;
      starting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size was calculated according to the following formula (comparison of means from the&#xD;
      intervention and control groups):&#xD;
&#xD;
      n = 2 (Zα + Zβ)² * S² (x1 - x2) ²&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was calculated using values from a previous cognitive-behavioral intervention&#xD;
      for armed-conflict victims of Buenaventura and Quibdó, Colombia&#xD;
      (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01856673). An Alfa error of 5%, power of 80%, and&#xD;
      standard deviation of 30 was used. The sample size of each arm necessary to obtain a&#xD;
      significant difference in means of symptoms between the control and intervention group is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      n = 2 (1.96 + 0.842)² * 30² / (20) ²&#xD;
&#xD;
      n = 35&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to this calculation a minimum of 35 volunteers must be recruited into each arm per&#xD;
      city (Cali and Tuluá), which means that overall 70 volunteers will be recruited into the&#xD;
      intervention group and 70 volunteers into the control group giving a total of 140 volunteers&#xD;
      in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information will be collected using digital tablets and transferred to a database designed&#xD;
      for the study. Confidentiality will be ensured by not including identifying variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An exploratory analysis to identify extreme values or missing data will be performed and&#xD;
      medical records will be revised to verify some of the information. A sample of the&#xD;
      instruments applied in the study will be audited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple imputation techniques will be used for all missing data including those resulting&#xD;
      from lost to follow up. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis based on probability weighting&#xD;
      will be used as a covariate in the final analysis for all missing data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anticipated results are a reduction in anxiety, depression, PTSD, low self-esteem and&#xD;
      emotional dependency symptoms, which will be greater in patients in the intervention group&#xD;
      compared those in the control group.&#xD;
