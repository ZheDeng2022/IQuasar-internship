      BACKGROUND Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a systemic inflammatory disease with articular and&#xD;
      extra-articular features. Establishing the prognosis of a patient with PsA is hence important&#xD;
      to define the treatment strategy. Currently, observational and prospective cohort studies&#xD;
      have identified prognostic factors correlating with the achievement of therapeutic response.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, despite the importance of identifying prognostic factors in a disease with a&#xD;
      functional disability comparable to rheumatoid arthritis, the studies are still limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE In PsA with clinically active joint disease starting a new course of&#xD;
      therapy, to evaluate the additional value of UltraSound(US)-score over clinical examination&#xD;
      in detecting patients achieving MDA at 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN The study follows a multi-centre observational prospective cohort study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATIENTS AND METHODS INCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adult &gt; 18 years of age with PsA (PsA according to the ClASsification criteria for&#xD;
           Psoriatic Arthritis (CASPAR) - with joint involvement)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At least one joint clinically involved (both swelling and tenderness);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  prescription of new course of d NSAIDs (monotherapy), steroid intra-articular injections&#xD;
           (monotherapy), conventional Disease-Modifying AntiRheumatic Drugs (DMARDs), biologic&#xD;
           DMARDs, including switches or dose augmentations indicated by the treating&#xD;
           rheumatologist according to usual clinical practice before US acquisition;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stable treatment before treatment modification (6 weeks);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Signed informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CLINICAL ASSESSMENT Patient's clinical assessment will be performed according to the core set&#xD;
      of domains for PsA proposed by the Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and&#xD;
      Psoriatic Arthritis (GRAPPA) and Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ULTRASOUND ASSESSMENT Sonographic evaluations will be performed by expert ultrasonographers&#xD;
      in 44 joints, 36 tendons, 12 entheses and 2 bursae according to the score developed for&#xD;
      psoriatic arthritis by the study group ultrasound of the Italian Society of Rheumatology&#xD;
      (US-score PsA-SIR)&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPECTED RESULTS AND SIGNIFICANCE The aim of this study is to identify clinical and US&#xD;
      predictors of achieving MDA in PsA patients with active peripheral arthritis starting a new&#xD;
      course of therapy.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a systemic inflammatory disease with articular and&#xD;
      extra-articular features. To date remission is considered to be the ultimate goal of therapy&#xD;
      in PsA, however, due to the characteristics of the disease with involvement of different&#xD;
      domains, remission may be difficult to achieve and maintain and so a minimal disease activity&#xD;
      (MDA) could be an acceptable goal. In view of the therapeutic target of remission or MDA, the&#xD;
      identification of adverse prognostic factors and the best treatment strategy are two of the&#xD;
      most important items in research agenda of PsA. Establishing the prognosis of a patient with&#xD;
      PsA is hence important to define the treatment strategy. Currently, observational and&#xD;
      prospective cohort studies have identified prognostic factors correlating with the&#xD;
      achievement of therapeutic response. Nevertheless, despite the importance of identifying&#xD;
      prognostic factors in a disease with a functional disability comparable to rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis (RA), the studies are still limited. Undoubtedly, the concept of treat-to-target&#xD;
      (T2T) in PsA needs further studies, especially with longer follow up and larger samples. In&#xD;
      T2T strategies, it is necessary to quantify the disease activity and this is possible by&#xD;
      composite indices. The heterogeneity of PsA including axial and peripheral involvement and&#xD;
      specific features (i.e. dactylitis, enthesitis) as well as extra-articular features makes the&#xD;
      use of a single composite index (e.g. Disease Activity for Psoriatic Arthritis-DAPSA,&#xD;
      Composite Psoriatic Disease Activity Index-CPDAI) a challenge not resolved yet. An&#xD;
      interesting possibility is to integrate musculoskeletal ultrasonography (US) with clinical&#xD;
      examination to stratify patients and to decide treatments in a T2T strategy. In the last&#xD;
      years the role of imaging is grown up and EULAR recommendations on the use of imaging&#xD;
      techniques in chronic arthritis recognize the high sensitivity of US to detect disease&#xD;
      activity better than clinical examination alone although the utility of US in clinical&#xD;
      practice is not supported by sufficient evidence yet&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to identify clinical and US predictors of achieving MDA in PsA&#xD;
      patients with active peripheral arthritis starting a new course of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identifying prognostic factors of achieving remission or low disease activity will allow a&#xD;
      better selection of patients with poorer outcome and a following improvement of the&#xD;
      therapeutic strategies. Furthermore the possibility that US could be an added prognostic&#xD;
      value makes this study a clear example of integration between the clinic and US. This study&#xD;
      will respond to the need of tailoring treatment that would allow clinicians to practice a&#xD;
      more effective and personalized medicine, optimizing the outcomes of patients with PsA as&#xD;
      well as the treatments management.&#xD;
&#xD;

      SAFETY MONITORING&#xD;
&#xD;
      An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence (i.e., any unfavourable and&#xD;
      unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory findings), symptom or disease) in a subject&#xD;
      after providing written informed consent for participation in the study. Therefore, an AE may&#xD;
      or may not be temporally or causally associated with the use of a specific medicinal product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DEFINITION OF SAE&#xD;

        -  Therapy factors:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment (NSAIDs, steroids, DMARDs)&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive data will be provided for all outcomes according to data type; number of patients&#xD;
      (N), mean, standard deviation (for interval data), median 25% and 75% quartiles (for ordinal&#xD;
      data). Frequency (absolute and relative) distributions will be provided for categorical data.&#xD;
      Two-sided p-values will be presented throughout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY ENDPOINT ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prediction of 6 month MDA will use multivariate adjusted logistic models. A baseline model&#xD;
      will include all the clinical variables. US predictors will be added as covariates to the&#xD;
      clinical variables, assuming an additive model. The derived ß coefficients were used to&#xD;
      calculate prognostic indices, thereby creating weighted prediction models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Model performance will be evaluated by C-indices (area under the ROC curve, AUC), net&#xD;
      reclassification indices (NRI), integrated discrimination improvement (IDI), and plotted ROC&#xD;
      curves. NRI can be used to compare the clinical impact of different models (it is a&#xD;
      comparison of the proportion of subjects with disease who have appropriately increased risk&#xD;
      scores with the new model, and the proportion of subjects without disease who have&#xD;
      appropriately decreased risk scores with the new model). IDI represents desired improvements&#xD;
      in average sensitivity corrected for undesirable increases in 1-specificity, it therefore&#xD;
      compared whether the new models improved sensitivity without affecting specificity.( ) Data&#xD;
      management and analysis will be performed using RedCap, R, Stata.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size calculation was done with the objective of minimizing the number of false&#xD;
      positives (i.e the number of false non-responsive to treatment) in order to minimize the risk&#xD;
      of over-treating patients who actually have a good response to therapy. Therefore, sample&#xD;
      size was calculated to minimize this risk by 40% (null hypothesis H0) to 20% (alternative&#xD;
      hypothesis H1), maintaining stable at 70% (both for the H0 for both the H1), the percentage&#xD;
      of true positives (true unresponsive to therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The simulations were carried out using the procedure rocsize Stata (by M. Pepe) 30, which&#xD;
      allows to determine the power to detect an improvement in the ROC curve. The procedure&#xD;
      requires the specification of the percentage of false positive and true positive both for the&#xD;
      null hypothesis is for the alternative hypothesis and the percentage of positive / diseased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the command rocsize 0.7 0.2, na (150) ndb (100) tpnull (0.7) fpnull (0.4) of Stata, 250&#xD;
      patients are sufficient to evaluate the performance of a model (and its ROC curve) with 90%&#xD;
      power and 5% alpha. Specifically, we have assumed a 70% and a 20% of subjects true positives&#xD;
      and false positives, respectively, according to the alternative hypothesis, a 70% and a 40%&#xD;
      of subjects true positives and false positives, respectively, according to the null&#xD;
      hypothesis, and a percentage of diseased of 60% (150 of 250 subjects).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under the assumption of maximum attrition of 20%, the sample size will be increased to 300&#xD;
      patients. The same sample size is sufficient to precisely estimate a logistic model of&#xD;
      achievement of a MDA (probability of 0.4 at 6 months) with 10 predictors (rule of thumbs).( )&#xD;
      Based on the pre-study activities, 35-40 centres will be involved, 15 tertiary and 20-25&#xD;
      secondary rheumatology centres. Assuming 4 eligible patients/months for tertiary and 1/month&#xD;
      in secondary centres, a 40% of enrolment rate, about 30 patients/months are expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICS&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations&#xD;
      including, but not limited to, the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Guideline&#xD;
      for Good Clinical Practice (GCP), EU guidelines and the ethical principles that have their&#xD;
      origins in the Declaration of Helsinki. The institutional review board (IRB)/independent&#xD;
      ethics committee (IEC) must review and approve the protocol and informed consent form before&#xD;
      any subjects are enrolled. Before any protocol-required procedures are performed, the subject&#xD;
      must sign and date the IRB/IEC-approved informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data (including AEs and concomitant medications) will be entered into a validated&#xD;
      data capture system provided by the Italian Society for Rheumatology. The data system will&#xD;
      include password protection and internal quality checks, such as automatic range checks, to&#xD;
      identify data that appear inconsistent, incomplete, or inaccurate.&#xD;
