      Serum level of total testosterone was measured in the early follicular phase (days 2-4 of&#xD;
      spontaneous cycle in oligomenorrhic patients). To start the study in amenorrhic patients&#xD;
      (after exclusion of pregnancy) they received progesterone (oral Norethisterone Acetate 10 mg&#xD;
      daily for 5 days) to induce withdrawal bleeding and total testosterone was measured in days&#xD;
      2-4 of this withdrawal bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Color Doppler ultrasound scanning will be performed to assess the subendometrial blood flow.&#xD;
      The subendometrial region was observed and analyzed in each woman using color and power&#xD;
      Doppler flow ultrasonography. By means of color and power Doppler flow imaging, color signals&#xD;
      was searched for in the subendometrial region and areas of maximum color intensity,&#xD;
      representing the greatest Doppler frequency shifts, was visualized, then selected for pulsed&#xD;
      Doppler examination. Pulsatility index (PI) and resistance index (RI) were calculated in each&#xD;
      selected Doppler wave.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laparoscopic ovarian drilling was performed under general anesthesia with good muscle&#xD;
      relaxation and endotracheal intubation using the three-punctures technique (one puncture 10mm&#xD;
      at the umbilicus and the other two punctures 5mm at both iliac fossa) in the early follicular&#xD;
      phase (after stoppage of menstrual or withdrawal bleeding).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A specially designed monopolar electrocautery probe was used to penetrate the ovarian capsule&#xD;
      at 4 points (regardless of the size of the ovary), with the aid of a short burst of monopolar&#xD;
      diathermy. The probe (which has a distal stainless steel needle measuring 10 mm in length and&#xD;
      2 mm in diameter) was applied to the surface of the ovary at a right angle to avoid slippage&#xD;
      and to minimize surface damage. A monopolar coagulating current at a 40 W power setting was&#xD;
      used. The needle was pushed through the ovarian capsule for about 4 mm depth into the ovarian&#xD;
      tissue and electricity was activated for 4 seconds. The ovary was then cooled using 200 ml&#xD;
      crystalloid solution before releasing the ligament.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total testosterone and blood flow assessment (PI - RI) of the subendometrial region were&#xD;
      performed again in the early follicular phase (days 2-4 of the menstrual cycle) of the first&#xD;
      post-operative spontaneous menstruation (which occurred within 10 weeks after the operation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, patients were followed to detect ovulation. ovulating patients were followed for 6&#xD;
      months to detect pregnancy.&#xD;

      Effect of Laparoscopic Ovarian Drilling on Subendometrial Blood Flow in Women with Polycystic&#xD;
      Ovary Syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This interventional study was carried out in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology&#xD;
      (Infertility, Ultrasound and Gynecologic endoscopy units), Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig&#xD;
      University Hospitals in the period between July 2016 and October 2017. The study included 200&#xD;
      infertile women (primary or secondary infertility) with PCOS attended the infertility&#xD;
      outpatient clinic and fulfilled the following inclusion criteria: 1- Patients' ages 20 to 34&#xD;
      years; 2- BMI 18-25 kg/m2; 3- PCOS was diagnosed according to Rotterdam criteria, 2003 (two&#xD;
      criteria are sufficient for diagnosis of PCOS): (i) oligo-and/or an-ovulation; which is&#xD;
      manifested clinically by amenorrhoea or oligomenorrhoea, (ii) hyperandrogenism (clinical&#xD;
      and/or biochemical); (hirsutism and/or elevated serum level of total testosterone), (iii)&#xD;
      polycystic ovaries by ultrasound (each ovary contains 12 or more follicles measuring 2-9 mm&#xD;
      and/ or ovarian volume more than 10 ml), ( we included only patients who had the three&#xD;
      criteria of PCOS) , and previously documented anovulation by transvaginal ultrasound&#xD;
      follicular monitoring while taking incremental doses of clomiphene citrate (clomiphene&#xD;
      citrate resistant); 4- Hysterosalpingography and husband semen analysis were normal in all&#xD;
      subjects. 5- All women in the study were free of any medical illness and had not received any&#xD;
      medications in the last 6-9 months before the study apart from clomiphene citrate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria were: 1- Other PCOS like syndromes (late onset congenital adrenal&#xD;
      hyperplasia-androgen producing tumors-Cushing,s syndrome), hyperprolactinemia and thyroid&#xD;
      abnormalities; 2- Gross ovarian pathology either diagnosed preoperatively by ultrasound or&#xD;
      intraoperatively by laparoscopy; 3- Any uterine pathology diagnosed preoperatively by&#xD;
      ultrasound, HSG or hysteroscopy; or intraoperatively by endoscopy and suspected to cause&#xD;
      infertility; 3- Other causes of infertility even if diagnosed during laparoscopy such as&#xD;
      tubal pathology and pelvic endometriosis or adhesions; 4- Previous uterine, tubal or ovarian&#xD;
      surgery. 5- Contraindications to laparoscopy and general anesthesia; 6- Pregnancy before the&#xD;
      first post-operative menstrual cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After full detailed history taking, general, abdominal and local examination and exclusion of&#xD;
      any associated medical disorders, transabdominal and/or transvaginal ultrasound was done to&#xD;
      exclude patients with ovarian or pelvi-abdominal masses. Other investigations were done to&#xD;
      fulfill the inclusion and exclusion criteria (serum prolactin level, free T3, free T4, TSH).&#xD;
      Serum level of total testosterone was measured in the early follicular phase (days 2-4 of&#xD;
      spontaneous cycle in oligomenorrhic patients). To start the study in amenorrhic patients&#xD;
      (after exclusion of pregnancy) they received progesterone (oral Norethisterone Acetate 10 mg&#xD;
      daily for 5 days) to induce withdrawal bleeding and total testosterone was measured in days&#xD;
      2-4 of this withdrawal bleeding. Total testosterone was done for all patients in the&#xD;
      Laboratory of Zagazig University Hospitals by Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) technology&#xD;
      (Cobas e 411 analyzer-Roche Diagnostics GmbH-D-68298 Mannheim-Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transvaginal 2D color Doppler probe of Voluson 730 pro V machine (GE healthcare, Austria with&#xD;
      a 3.5 MHz sector transducer for TAS and 7.5 MHz sector transducer for TVS) was used. While&#xD;
      the patients in lithotomy position after evacuation of their urinary bladder and on the same&#xD;
      days of total testosterone level assay, baseline 2D TVS was used to examine the uterus for&#xD;
      any abnormality and measuring the uterine size and endometrial thickness and then to identify&#xD;
      PCO criteria in both ovaries and ovarian volume was measured using ellipisoid prolate&#xD;
      formulae (length X width X height X 0.523, which is calculated automatically by the software&#xD;
      of the ultrasound machine), (each ovary contains 12 or more follicles measuring 2-9 mm and/&#xD;
      or ovarian volume more than 10 ml) then color Doppler ultrasound scanning will be performed&#xD;
      to assess the subendometrial blood flow. The subendometrial region was observed and analyzed&#xD;
      in each woman using color and power Doppler flow ultrasonography. By means of color and power&#xD;
      Doppler flow imaging, color signals was searched for in the subendometrial region and areas&#xD;
      of maximum color intensity, representing the greatest Doppler frequency shifts, was&#xD;
      visualized, then selected for pulsed Doppler examination. Pulsatility index (PI) and&#xD;
      resistance index (RI) were calculated in each selected Doppler wave.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laparoscopic ovarian drilling was performed under general anesthesia with good muscle&#xD;
      relaxation and endotracheal intubation using the three-punctures technique (one puncture 10mm&#xD;
      at the umbilicus and the other two punctures 5mm at both iliac fossa) in the early follicular&#xD;
      phase (after stoppage of menstrual or withdrawal bleeding). The zero-degree telescope (Karl&#xD;
      Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany) was introduced to visualize the peritoneal cavity. The pelvis was&#xD;
      thoroughly inspected for any pathology and the ovaries were examined for the features of&#xD;
      polycystic ovary (bilateral ovarian enlargement with smooth glistening surface unbroken by&#xD;
      the usual wrinkles and thick, smooth, whitish capsule). Methylene blue test was done for all&#xD;
      patients to examine the tubal patency and bilateral tubal patency is mandatory before ovarian&#xD;
      drilling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A specially designed monopolar electrocautery probe was used to penetrate the ovarian capsule&#xD;
      at 4 points (regardless of the size of the ovary), with the aid of a short burst of monopolar&#xD;
      diathermy. The probe (which has a distal stainless steel needle measuring 10 mm in length and&#xD;
      2 mm in diameter) was applied to the surface of the ovary at a right angle to avoid slippage&#xD;
      and to minimize surface damage. A monopolar coagulating current at a 40 W power setting was&#xD;
      used. The needle was pushed through the ovarian capsule for about 4 mm depth into the ovarian&#xD;
      tissue and electricity was activated for 4 seconds. The ovary was then cooled using 200 ml&#xD;
      crystalloid solution before releasing the ligament.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total testosterone and blood flow assessment (PI - RI) of the subendometrial region were&#xD;
      performed again in the early follicular phase (days 2-4 of the menstrual cycle) of the first&#xD;
      post-operative spontaneous menstruation (which occurred within 10 weeks after the operation).&#xD;
      In non-menstruating patients, total testosterone and the blood flow assessment were performed&#xD;
      by the end of the 10 weeks. In menstruating patients, this cycle was monitored to detect&#xD;
      ovulation. Ovulation was assessed by serial transvaginal ultrasound until visualization of&#xD;
      pre-ovulatory follicle of at least 18 mm. Ovulation was confirmed by seeing follicle collapse&#xD;
      on subsequent transvaginal ultrasound, appearance of fluid in the Cul-de-sac and elevated&#xD;
      mid-luteal serum progesterone level &gt;5 ng/ml. Ovulating group was informed to report the&#xD;
      occurrence of natural conception for 6 months after LOD. Pregnancy was diagnosed by positive&#xD;
      pregnancy test with seeing intrauterine gestational sac by transvaginal ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who did not menstruate (pregnancy was excluded at first) or did not ovulate within&#xD;
      10 weeks after drilling as evidenced by poor or no follicular growth by serial transvaginal&#xD;
      ultrasound folliculometry, and low mid-luteal serum progesterone level &lt; 5 ng/ml were&#xD;
      referred to another group of researchers for re-evaluation&#xD;
