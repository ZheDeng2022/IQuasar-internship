  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of Cannabidiol Oral Solution in&#xD;
      the treatment of pediatric participants with treatment-resistant childhood absence seizures.&#xD;
      This study will also assess safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of Cannabidiol Oral&#xD;
      Solution, and any improvement in qualitative assessments of participant status over the&#xD;
      duration of the study in pediatric participants with treatment-resistant childhood absence&#xD;
      seizures. The study will include a 4-week Screening Period, a 5 or 10 day Titration Period&#xD;
      (depending study Cohort), a 4-week Treatment Period followed by 5-day Tapering for doses &gt;20&#xD;
      mg/kg/day and a 4-week Follow-up Period.&#xD;

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    More patients in Cohort 1 than Cohort 2 demonstrated a clinically meaningful reduction of&#xD;
    seizure count. Given this, enrollment of Cohort 3 was discontinued.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Screening (Visit 1, Day -28 to -1 of Screening Period) up to Visit 7 (Week 4 of the Follow-Up Period)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a pharmaceutical product during the course of a clinical investigation. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational product, whether or not thought to be related to the investigational product. A TEAE is an AE with onset that occurs after receiving study drug. A SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that results in death, is life-threatening, requires the participant be at a risk of death at the time of the event, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital abnormality/birth defect, or other serious event that requires medical or surgical intervention.</description>
