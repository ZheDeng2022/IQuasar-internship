  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies pembrolizumab and radiation therapy in treating patients with&#xD;
      intermediate or high-grade soft tissue sarcoma. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies,&#xD;
      such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere&#xD;
      with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays&#xD;
      to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving pembrolizumab and radiation therapy may work&#xD;
      better in treating patients with soft tissue sarcoma.&#xD;

      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) per institutional standard at the Seattle&#xD;
      Cancer Care Alliance as an outpatient therapy. Cycles repeat every 3 weeks, up to a maximum&#xD;
      of three doses, for 3 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      Patients also undergo radiation therapy daily for 5-6 weeks beginning on Day 1 of Week 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days after last dose, 90&#xD;
      days after last dose, 30 days after post-operative visit (wound care follow-up), and then&#xD;
      every 12 weeks for up to 1 year, then every 6 months up to 5 years.&#xD;
