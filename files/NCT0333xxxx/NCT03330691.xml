  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with relapsed or refractory leukemia often develop resistance to chemotherapy and&#xD;
      some patients who relapse following CD19 directed therapy relapse with CD19 negative&#xD;
      leukemia. For this reason, the investigators are attempting to use T-cells obtained directly&#xD;
      from the patient, which can be genetically modified to express two chimeric antigen receptors&#xD;
      (CARs). One is to recognize CD19 and the other is to recognize CD22, both of which are&#xD;
      proteins expressed on the surface of the leukemic cell in patients with CD19+CD22+ leukemia.&#xD;
      The CAR enables the T-cell to recognize and kill the leukemic cell through recognition of&#xD;
      CD19 and CD22. This is a phase 1 study designed to determine the safety of the CAR+ T-cells&#xD;
      and the feasibility of making enough to treat patients with CD19+CD22+ leukemia.&#xD;
