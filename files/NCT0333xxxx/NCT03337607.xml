      This study tests the hypothesis that radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy (rESWT) in&#xD;
      combination with the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Celecoxib and the antispasmodic&#xD;
      drug Eperisone (hereafter, &quot;C-E drug therapy&quot;) is statistically significantly more effective&#xD;
      than either rESWT or C-E drug therapy alone in the treatment of chronic non-specific low back&#xD;
      pain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-specific low back pain is defined as low back pain not attributable to a recognizable,&#xD;
      known specific pathology (e.g., infection, tumour, osteoporosis, fracture, structural&#xD;
      deformity, inflammatory disorder, radicular syndrome, or cauda equina syndrome). It is second&#xD;
      only to the common cold as the most common affliction of mankind and is among the leading&#xD;
      complaints bringing patients to physicians' offices. The reported point prevalence of&#xD;
      non-specific low back pain is as high as 33 percent, its one-year prevalence as high as 73&#xD;
      percent and its lifetime prevalence exceeds 70% in most industrialized countries, with an&#xD;
      annual incidence of 15% to 20% in the United States of America. In physically active adults&#xD;
      not seeking medical attention, the annual incidence of clinically significant non-specific&#xD;
      low back pain with functional impairment is approximately 10 to 15 percent. In China,&#xD;
      non-specific low back pain has become one of the leading causes of disability-adjusted&#xD;
      life-years (DALYs) in 2010. Some authors reported the prevalence of non-specific low back&#xD;
      pain as 41% in Chinese adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management for patients with non-specific low back pain is challenged by the problems that&#xD;
      most back pain has no recognizable cause (&gt;85%), an underlying systemic disease is rare, and&#xD;
      most episodes of back pain are unpreventable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute non-specific low back pain (lasting three to six weeks) usually resolves in several&#xD;
      weeks, although recurrences are common and low-grade symptoms are often present years after&#xD;
      an initial episode. Risk factors for the development of disabling chronic or persistent&#xD;
      non-specific low back pain (variously defined as lasting more than three months or more than&#xD;
      six months) include preexisting psychological distress, disputed compensation issues, other&#xD;
      types of chronic pain, and job dissatisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goals of management for patients with non-specific low back pain are to decrease the&#xD;
      pain, restore mobility, hasten recovery so the patient can resume normal daily activities as&#xD;
      soon as possible, (iv) prevent development of a chronic recurrent condition, and restore and&#xD;
      preserve physical and financial independence and comfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, few if any treatments have been proven effective for non-specific low back&#xD;
      pain in meta-analyses, including limited bed rest, physical activity and exercise, back&#xD;
      schools, traction, massage, chiropractic, radiofrequency denervation, paracetamol, opioids&#xD;
      and, ultimately, surgery (in cases of cauda equina syndrome, infections, tumors and fractures&#xD;
      compressing the spinal cord, mechanical instability of the back, and, perhaps, intractable&#xD;
      pain with a positive straight-leg-raising test and no response to conservative therapy).&#xD;
      Earlier studies demonstrated that muscle relaxants are effective in the management of&#xD;
      non-specific low back pain, but the adverse effects require that they be used with caution.&#xD;
      Accordingly, the aforementioned guideline by the American College of Physicians is only based&#xD;
      on low- and moderate-quality evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) was introduced into the management of&#xD;
      non-specific low back pain. The use of extracorporeal shock waves (ESWs) in medicine was&#xD;
      first reported over 30 years ago as a treatment for kidney stones, and is commonly referred&#xD;
      to as extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL). Extracorporeal shock waves are also used&#xD;
      as a treatment for various musculoskeletal conditions such as calcifying tendinopathy of the&#xD;
      shoulder, epicondylitis, Achilles tendinopathy and plantar fasciitis, and is commonly&#xD;
      referred to as 'extracorporeal shock wave therapy', or 'ESWT' to differentiate from ESWL.&#xD;
      ESWT is effective and safe, and for the aforementioned conditions randomized controlled&#xD;
      trials (RCTs) on ESWT were the predominant type of RCT listed in the PEDro database and/or&#xD;
      obtained the highest PEDro scores among all investigated treatment modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are three different types of ESWs used in ESWT for musculoskeletal conditions, focused,&#xD;
      defocused and radial, and several modes of operation of focused, defocused and radial&#xD;
      extracorporeal shock wave generators. Focused, defocused and radial ESWs are single acoustic&#xD;
      impulses with an initial high positive peak pressure between 10 and 100 megapascals (MPa)&#xD;
      reached in less than one microsecond (µs). The positive pressure amplitude is followed by a&#xD;
      low tensile amplitude of a few microseconds duration that can generate cavitation. They are&#xD;
      further characterized by a short life cycle of approximately 10-20 µs and a broad frequency&#xD;
      spectrum. Focused ESWs differ from radial ESWs in the penetration depth into the tissue, some&#xD;
      physical characteristics, and the technique for generating them. However, without going into&#xD;
      detail, there is no scientific evidence in favor of either radial ESWT (rESWT) or focused&#xD;
      ESWT (fESWT) with respect to treatment outcome, and no scientific evidence that a certain&#xD;
      fESWT technology is superior to the other technologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several molecular and cellular mechanisms were reported on how ESWs might mediate their&#xD;
      pain-relieving action. Specifically, exposure of the distal femur of rabbits to focused ESWs&#xD;
      decreased the amount of Substance P (SP) in the periosteum and diminished the number of&#xD;
      neurons immunoreactive for substance P in dorsal root ganglia L5. Furthermore, application of&#xD;
      shock waves to rat skin decreased calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) immunoreactivity in&#xD;
      dorsal root ganglion neurons. Substance P is concentrated in unmyelinated C-fibers&#xD;
      (responsible for throbbing, chronic pain) and a subpopulation of slowly conducting, lightly&#xD;
      myelinated A-delta nerve fibers, and is released at central and peripheral terminals of&#xD;
      sensory nociceptive neurons after stimulation. CGRP is a marker of sensory neurons typically&#xD;
      involved with pain perception and was immunohistochemically co-localized with substance P in&#xD;
      capsaicin-sensitive axons. Activation of peripheral small diameter sensory neurons by local&#xD;
      depolarization, axonal reflexes, or dorsal root reflexes releases substance P and CGRP. Both&#xD;
      substances then act on target cells in the periphery such as mast cells, immune cells and&#xD;
      vascular smooth muscle cells, thus producing inflammation. This phenomenon is called&#xD;
      neurogenic inflammation, and is an inflammatory symptom that results from the release of&#xD;
      substances from primary sensory nerve terminals. Evidence has emerged that chronic&#xD;
      inflammation contributes to the etiology of pain in insertion tendinopathies such as tennis&#xD;
      elbow and chronic plantar fasciitis. Furthermore, it was found that SP (as well as&#xD;
      interleukin 1 alpha and transforming growth factor beta-1) are involved in the pathogenesis&#xD;
      of tennis elbow, without apparent infiltration of inflammatory cells. Moreover, depletion of&#xD;
      substance P was repeatedly shown to reduce experimentally induced inflammation of paws and&#xD;
      joints in laboratory animals. It is therefore reasonable to hypothesize that reduction of SP&#xD;
      and CGRP in the target tissue in conjunction with reduced synthesis of this molecule in&#xD;
      dorsal root ganglia cells plays an important role in ESWT-mediated long-term analgesia in the&#xD;
      treatment of musculoskeletal conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With respect to non-specific low back pain it is important to note that in rats, the presence&#xD;
      of SP and CGRP immunoreactive nerve fibers was demonstrated in the lumber facet joints.&#xD;
      Furthermore, SP immunoreactive fibers were found more extensively in lumbar intervertebral&#xD;
      discs from patients with discogenic low back pain than in normal control discs, together with&#xD;
      the formation of a zone of vascularized granulation tissue from the nucleus pulposus to the&#xD;
      outer part of the annulus fibrosus along the edges of the fissures. These findings suggested&#xD;
      that the zone of granulation tissue with extensive innervation along the tears in the&#xD;
      posterior part of the painful disc may be responsible for causing the pain of discography and&#xD;
      of discogenic low back pain. Accordingly, ESWT could be of great significance in the&#xD;
      treatment of persistent non-specific low back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The studies on ESWT for non-specific low back pain performed so far have only established&#xD;
      very limited evidence of efficacy and safety of ESWT for non-specific low back pain. This is&#xD;
      due to low sample size, lack of power analyses, lack of reporting critical information such&#xD;
      as the follow-up interval, and the fact that only one RCT on this indication was performed so&#xD;
      far.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accordingly, further research is needed to support the use of ESWT for non-specific low back&#xD;
      pain. Taking into account the well-known molecular and cellular mechanisms of action of ESWT&#xD;
      in pain relief (outlined in detail above), the proven efficacy and safety of rESWT for&#xD;
      treating musculoskeletal conditions, and the fact that a ceratin rESWT device provided by&#xD;
      Electro Medical Systems (Nyon, Switzerland) has become by far the best investigated ESWT&#xD;
      technology in the field of Evidence Based Medicine, it is reasonable to hypothesize that&#xD;
      treatment of non-specific low back pain with rESWT is not only effective and safe but will&#xD;
      get widespread acceptance and clinical use as soon as effectiveness and safety will be&#xD;
      demonstrated in a randomized controlled trial. This is the purpose of the proposed project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard therapy of chronic non-specific low back pain at the Department of Pain Medicine&#xD;
      at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University consists of the non-steroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drug Celecoxib and the antispasmodic drug Eperisone (hereafter, &quot;C-E drug&#xD;
      therapy&quot;). Considering the established evidence of superiority of combination therapies of&#xD;
      rESWT and other treatment modalities (such as the combination of rESWT and plantar&#xD;
      fascia-specific stretching in case of chronic plantar fasciitis and the combination of rESWT&#xD;
      and eccentric loading in case of chronic midportion Achilles tendinopathy) the proposed study&#xD;
      will specifically test the hypothesis that rESWT in combination with C-E drug therapy is&#xD;
      statistically significantly more effective than either rESWT or C-E drug therapy alone in the&#xD;
      treatment of chronic non-specific low back pain.&#xD;
