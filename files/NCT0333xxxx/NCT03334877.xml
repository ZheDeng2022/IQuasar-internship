  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Two hundred and twenty women with singleton pregnancies and risk factors for spontaneous&#xD;
      preterm birth were included in this study. Cervico vaginal fluid sampling was undertaken for&#xD;
      qualitative assessment of β -human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) and fetal&#xD;
      fibronectin(fFN)at 24 weeks of gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For qualitative assay of both b-hCG and fFN, first vaginal specimens were collected by the&#xD;
      following method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specimen collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sterile Cusco speculum was introduced into the vagina; the anterior lip of the cervix was&#xD;
      grasped with sponge forceps and a cotton-tipped swab was placed into the external part of the&#xD;
      endocervical canal (not reaching the internal os) and then into the posterior fornix (each&#xD;
      for at least 1 min) to obtain an adequate sample of cervico vaginal secretions. Sampling was&#xD;
      performed before doing any cervical manipulation (digital or ultrasound examination) and&#xD;
      before introducing any vaginal material (lubricants or medications). The Hologic Specimen&#xD;
      Collection Kit is the only acceptable specimen collection system which can be used to collect&#xD;
      specimens for this assay. The polyester tipped swab provided in the Specimen Collection Kit&#xD;
      should be inserted into the vagina and lightly rotated across the posterior fornix for&#xD;
      approximately 10 seconds to absorb the cervico vaginal secretions. Once the specimen is&#xD;
      obtained, carefully remove the swab from the vagina and place it into the tube of buffer&#xD;
      provided with the Specimen Collection Kit. Two Specimen Collection Device per patient were&#xD;
      obtained; one for each assay. Label the Specimen Transport Tubes with the patient's name and&#xD;
      any other identifying information required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All women were then followed up till delivery. Women were categorized into two arms: women&#xD;
      who delivered preterm (before 37 completed weeks of gestation) and women who delivered at&#xD;
      term (after 37 completed weeks of gestation).&#xD;

      Patients and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective observational study was undertaken from May 2015to October 2017 at Zagazig&#xD;
      university hospitals.This study was approved by the Research Ethical Committee of Zagazig&#xD;
      university hospital. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Two hundred&#xD;
      and twenty women with singleton pregnancies and risk factors for spontaneous preterm birth&#xD;
      were included in this study. Cervico vaginal fluid sampling was undertaken for qualitative&#xD;
      assessment of β -human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) and fetal fibronectin (fFN) at 24 weeks&#xD;
      of gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There were past history of one or more spontaneous preterm labor or preterm rupture of&#xD;
      membranes at less than 37 weeks of gestation, previous spontaneous second trimester&#xD;
      miscarriage, previous cervical surgery (large loop excision of the transformation zone, loop&#xD;
      electro surgical excision procedure, laser or cone excision), or an accidental finding of a&#xD;
      cervical length of 25 mm or less in the current pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who reported prior sexual intercourse (within 24 hours), or confirmed or suspected&#xD;
      rupture of membranes, or who had vaginal bleeding visible on the swab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gestational age was confirmed by early obstetric ultrasonography (11-14 weeks of gestation).&#xD;
      Participant baseline demographic data, obstetric history, and risk factors were tabulated and&#xD;
      analysed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For qualitative assay of both b-hCG and fFN, first vaginal specimens were collected by the&#xD;
      following method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specimen collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sterile Cusco speculum was introduced into the vagina; the anterior lip of the cervix was&#xD;
      grasped with sponge forceps and a cotton-tipped swab was placed into the external part of the&#xD;
      endocervical canal (not reaching the internal os) and then into the posterior fornix (each&#xD;
      for at least 1 min) to obtain an adequate sample of cervico vaginal secretions. Sampling was&#xD;
      performed before doing any cervical manipulation (digital or ultrasound examination) and&#xD;
      before introducing any vaginal material (lubricants or medications). The Hologic Specimen&#xD;
      Collection Kit is the only acceptable specimen collection system which can be used to collect&#xD;
      specimens for this assay. The polyester tipped swab provided in the Specimen Collection Kit&#xD;
      should be inserted into the vagina and lightly rotated across the posterior fornix for&#xD;
      approximately 10 seconds to absorb the cervico vaginal secretions. Once the specimen is&#xD;
      obtained, carefully remove the swab from the vagina and place it into the tube of buffer&#xD;
      provided with the Specimen Collection Kit. Two Specimen Collection Device per patient were&#xD;
      obtained; one for each assay. Label the Specimen Transport Tubes with the patient's name and&#xD;
      any other identifying information required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative assessment of β-hCG assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The qualitative assay of β-hCGwas performed as a bedside test. The swab was then inserted in&#xD;
      a tube containing 0.75 ml of sterile normal saline for dilution. From this sample, three&#xD;
      drops were used for a bedside HCG test using ACON-HCG one-step pregnancy test strip (Rapid&#xD;
      diagnostic Pvt. Ltd, India). with a detection cut-off value of 25 mIU/ ML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative assessment of fFNtest:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was done using Quick Check fFN test; it is a 10-minute, one-step, visual test. The test&#xD;
      strip was removed from the foil pouch and its lower end (indicated by the arrows) was&#xD;
      inserted into the tube containing the extraction buffer for 10 minutes. A positive sample&#xD;
      contain fFN will result in two lines in test strip and a negative sample will result in one&#xD;
      control line in test strip.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All women were then followed up till delivery. Women were categorized into two arms: women&#xD;
      who delivered preterm (before 37 completed weeks of gestation) and women who delivered at&#xD;
      term (after 37 completed weeks of gestation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those women who had iatrogenic preterm labor due to fetal or maternal indications were&#xD;
      excluded from the final statistical analysis and were calculated among the women who did not&#xD;
      complete follow up. Only women with spontaneous preterm labor were included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnancy outcome details were obtained from handheld notes, reviewed by trained research&#xD;
      midwives, and entered onto the study database. Data entry was checked for inaccuracies&#xD;
      contemporaneously by senior research midwives. Women were considered to have the outcome of&#xD;
      interest (spontaneous preterm birth) if they had spontaneous onset of labor, or experienced&#xD;
      preterm premature rupture of membranes with subsequent premature delivery&#xD;
