  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis, chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, affects&#xD;
      approximately 100,000 peoples in France. It is the leading cause of disability in young&#xD;
      adults. Tremor is a common symptom (25-58% of patients depending on the series) and can be&#xD;
      particularly disabling. The drug treatments against tremor are ineffective or insufficient.&#xD;
      Deep brain stimulation of the Vim (Small nucleus within thalamus) and stereotactic&#xD;
      radiofrequency thalamotomy have shown their efficacy in this indication. However, in some&#xD;
      cases these invasive procedures are impossible because of operational risk. Gamma knife&#xD;
      thalamotomy can be an alternative choice. This procedure, less invasive, mainly because of&#xD;
      the absence of craniotomy is used by several teams of international reputation for over&#xD;
      fifteen years, with good to excellent results in essential tremor. The team of Marseille,&#xD;
      which has an experience of 22 years in Gamma Knife radiosurgery has treated 250 patients with&#xD;
      severe tremor (essential tremor or Parkinson's disease) by a unilateral thalamotomy with an&#xD;
      improvement of 70% of functional scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the literature, no formal studies of the effect of Gamma Knife in Multiple Sclerosis (MS)&#xD;
      tremor is reported. There are only a few cases without specific evaluation of the efficacy in&#xD;
      this disease. Hence the importance of studying in detail the effects of this technique, which&#xD;
      allows a precise and limited lesion volume. Using an isocenter of 4mm and a dose of 130 Gy&#xD;
      radiation lesion obtained is limited to a volume of 200 to 500 mm3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess through a minimally invasive technique with a&#xD;
      circumscribed and reproducible lesion volume, the effect of thalamotomy on the particular&#xD;
      tremor in multiple sclerosis with a prospective evaluation of its effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with MS with a disabling tremor will be included in the study. They will be assessed&#xD;
      with neurological examination, quality of life scales, neuropsychological assessment,&#xD;
      functional scores and cerebral MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of Gamma Knife thalamotomy in&#xD;
      MS patients with severe tremor.&#xD;
