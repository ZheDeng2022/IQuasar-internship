  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study determines the acute effect of a dietary fiber mix on blood glucose levels.&#xD;
      Participants will consume the fiber mix as a drink and we will monitor changes in blood&#xD;
      glucose levels. All participants will consume white bread as the control food.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is some evidence for increased dietary fiber intake to positively impact on metabolic&#xD;
      outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes, potentially via modulating gut microbial&#xD;
      composition and functions. We have developed a dietary fiber mix that is consisted of fiber&#xD;
      of various physicochemical properties to maximize the fermentability of the supplement and&#xD;
      thus its effects on the gut microbiota. Since the fiber mix also contains nutrients that will&#xD;
      raise blood glucose levels, we need to characterize the glycemic response to the fiber mix&#xD;
      itself, before we can use it in an upcoming trial to determine the effect of dietary fiber&#xD;
      supplementation on the gut microbiota and glycemic control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled participants will be assigned to a subject group based on their diagnosis of type 2&#xD;
      diabetes and fasting blood glucose concentrations. Participants who are clinically diagnosed&#xD;
      with impaired glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes will be assigned to the&#xD;
      Prediabetes/Diabetes group. For the other participants, those with fasting blood glucose &lt;&#xD;
      100 mg/dL will be assigned to the Non-Diabetes group, and those with fasting blood glucose &gt;&#xD;
      100 mg/dL will be assigned to the Prediabetes/Diabetes group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will attend 8 food testing visits over 2 weeks. For each visit, participants&#xD;
      will attend the research facility in the morning after an overnight fast. They will consume&#xD;
      either white bread (with 50 g of available carbohydrates as a control food) or 60 g of the&#xD;
      fiber mix (as a drink).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postprandial glycemic response will be assessed by changes in blood glucose levels, to be&#xD;
      monitored using a continuous glucose monitoring system (FreeStyle Pro). A sensor will be&#xD;
      placed on the participant's arm and will stay on until the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will provide photos of all the food and drink and a brief description of what&#xD;
      they have consumed throughout the 2-week study.&#xD;
