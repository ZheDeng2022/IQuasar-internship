  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of 5 weeks treatment with&#xD;
      dapagliflozin in type 2 diabetes patients on how the hormone insulin acts on sugar uptake in&#xD;
      muscles.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To investigate if dapagliflozin improves skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity expressed as&#xD;
      corrected glucose disposal rate (cGDR) in comparison with placebo after 5-week double blind&#xD;
      treatment. Insulin sensitivity will be determined using a 2-step euglycemic hyperinsulinemic&#xD;
      clamp (EHC) procedure&#xD;

    <measure>Corrected Glucose Disposal Rate (cGDR) Measured as Change in Rate of Disposal (Delta RD) Basal vs High Insulin After 5 Weeks of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>At end (Week 5) of Treatment Periods 1 and 2</time_frame>
    <description>Skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity was measured as cGDR (referred to as delta RD [basal vs high insulin]) using a 2-step 5.5 hour euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp (EHC) procedure in combination with infusion of D-glucose (6,6-D2) glucose. Delta RD (basal vs high insulin) was corrected for urinary glucose excretion and measured at the end of Treatment Periods 1 and 2.</description>

    <measure>Change in Endogenous Glucose Production (EGP) After 5 Weeks of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>At end (Week 5) of Treatment Periods 1 and 2</time_frame>
    <description>A 2-step 5.5 hour EHC in combination with infusion of 6,6-D2 glucose was used to determine rates of EGP at the end of Treatment Periods 1 and 2. Results of the change in EGP are presented as delta EGP (basal vs low insulin and basal vs high insulin).</description>

    <measure>Change in Respiratory Exchange Ratio (RER) From Fasted State to Insulin Stimulated State After 5 Weeks of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>At end (Week 5) of Treatment Periods 1 and 2</time_frame>
    <description>During the indirect calorimetry of the EHC test, respiratory gas exchange was measured using open air circuit respirometry with an automated ventilated hood system. Metabolic flexibility was determined by the change in RER from fasted state to insulin stimulated state at the end of Treatment Periods 1 and 2 and results are presented as delta RER (basal vs high insulin).</description>

    <time_frame>At end (Week 5) of Treatment Periods 1 and 2</time_frame>
    <description>From the end of Day 1 until the morning of Day 3 of the end of each treatment visit, the patients stayed in the metabolic chamber (36 hours). During this stay FGF21 was measured in plasma before and after meals and before bed-time to determine the AUC (last 24 hours).</description>

        <description>During the indirect calorimetry of the EHC test, respiratory gas exchange was measured using open air circuit respirometry with an automated ventilated hood system. Metabolic flexibility was determined by the change in RER from fasted state to insulin stimulated state at the end of Treatment Periods 1 and 2 and results are presented as delta RER (basal vs high insulin).</description>
