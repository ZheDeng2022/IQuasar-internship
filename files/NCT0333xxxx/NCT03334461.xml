  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During orthodontic treatment intraoral corrosion results with release of nickel and titanium&#xD;
      ions from orthodontic appliances in surrounding tissues. Those transported in the saliva and&#xD;
      blood may cause a series of side effects from hypersensitivity reactions and soft tissue&#xD;
      proliferation to cyto and genotoxicity. Nickel is one of the strongest contact allergens,&#xD;
      present in numerous dental alloys. The aim of this project is to investigate the immune&#xD;
      potential of nickel and titan ions (development of allergies, changes in cariogenic potential&#xD;
      of dental plaque, resistance of gingivitis to therapy, and bacterial resistance to&#xD;
      antibiotics) and changes in performance of orthodontic appliances with repercussion on&#xD;
      regeneration of bone and periodontal tissues.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tooth movement with appliances based on nickel and titanium has got great osteogenic&#xD;
      potential and can regenerate deficient parts of alveolar bone and gingiva and rehabilitate&#xD;
      compromised occlusal relations and a patient's masticatory function. Due to the extended&#xD;
      duration of this therapy, different procedures are carried out and materials are applied for&#xD;
      prevention and regeneration of damaged enamel and oral mucosa. The oral cavity may be&#xD;
      considered a galvanic cell in which dental alloys act as electrodes, while saliva and oral&#xD;
      preventive and regenerative agents act as electrolites. The interaction causes corrosion,&#xD;
      reduction of elasticity and increase of stiffness of appliances, which may in turn result in&#xD;
      excessive forces, a disruption of tissue regeneration and irreparable damage of tooth roots,&#xD;
      surrounding alveolar bone, periodontal ligament, gingiva and pulp.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the extended exposion, released corrosive products in surrounding tissues and those&#xD;
      transported in saliva and blood may cause a series of side effects from hypersensitivity&#xD;
      reactions and soft tissue proliferation to cyto and genotoxicity. Today, allergies are ever&#xD;
      more frequent and arise earlier in life. A specific group are children and young adolescents&#xD;
      in pubertal growth, a period in which the immune system develops. Nickel is one of the&#xD;
      strongest contact allergens, present in numerous dental alloys. Nickel allergy is occurs in&#xD;
      up to 28.5% of population and cannot be deemed as low potential risk anymore.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast, titan was considered a biocompatible material of no allergic potential. However,&#xD;
      there is an increase in the frequency of presentations of different hypersensitivity&#xD;
      reactions to titan, especially in patients with pacemakers. Numerous patients with hip&#xD;
      endoprostheses, stents, dental implans and orthodontic appliances are exposed to titan. Titan&#xD;
      allergy may be the cause of unexplained cases of failure and rejection of dental implants.&#xD;
      Nickel and titan could cause bacterial resistance to antibiotics which may complicate&#xD;
      treatment of a series of infections that are more frequent in children and adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regulations for safety of medical products regulate safety issues of materials through&#xD;
      mandatory laboratory testing and expertise. However, the testing of interactions of these&#xD;
      materials with newly formed materials for prevention of damage and regeneration of orodental&#xD;
      tissues is not obligatory prior to the start of their commercial use. Such testing should be&#xD;
      conducted by independent scientific insitutions and not by producers with direct commercial&#xD;
      interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this project is to investigate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the corrosion of dental materials and appliances based on nickel and titan (in saliva&#xD;
           and due to interaction with probiotics, remineralising agents and antiseptics)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the immune potential of nickel and titan ions (development of allergies, changes in&#xD;
           cariogenic potential of dental plaque, resistency of gingivitis to therapy, and&#xD;
           bacterial resistance to antibiotics)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. the effect of nickel and titan ions cellular level&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. changes in performance of dental appliances with repercussion on regeneration of bone&#xD;
           and periodontal tissues.&#xD;
