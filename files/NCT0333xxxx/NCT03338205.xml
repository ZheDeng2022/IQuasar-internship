  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigation is to perform a pilot study assessing the safety and&#xD;
      utility of intravenous ketamine as an adjuvant therapy in the emergency department setting&#xD;
      for pediatric patients in acute status asthmaticus who have failed standard emergency&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study of a cohort of 20 subjects to assess the feasibility, safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of ketamine in status asthmaticus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will take place at the Augusta University's pediatric emergency department 24 hours&#xD;
      a day. The attending physician who is clinically treating the patient will identify the&#xD;
      patient as a potential study candidate (see inclusion criteria). Study team members will then&#xD;
      be notified and obtain informed consent for potential participants who meet the&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a patient in the Augusta University Children's Hospital of Georgia Pediatric Emergency&#xD;
      Department is deemed a potential study subject, informed consent will be obtained by the&#xD;
      research study team members. The patient and their parents will be provided with all the&#xD;
      required information about the study including potential risks and benefits associated with&#xD;
      participation. The information will be presented in a private setting in a language the&#xD;
      patient understands. The patient and/or their parent/guardian will have opportunities to ask&#xD;
      questions and will be given enough time to consider participation before providing consent. A&#xD;
      document will be given to obtain assent/consent that reiterates all the information about the&#xD;
      study (including reason for the study, risks, benefits, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study team members that will be actively involved in the study will be either pediatric&#xD;
      emergency medicine faculty or pediatric emergency medicine fellows that are on staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients that meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will have ketamine 1 mg/kg IV bolus&#xD;
      administered once informed consent has been obtained.&#xD;
