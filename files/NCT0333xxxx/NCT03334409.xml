    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well pazopanib hydrochloride with or without&#xD;
      ascorbic acid work in treating patients with kidney cancer that has spread to other places in&#xD;
      the body (metastatic) or cannot be removed by surgery. Pazopanib hydrochloride may stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Ascorbic acid&#xD;
      may help pazopanib hydrochloride stop tumor growth and improve treatment survival. Giving&#xD;
      pazopanib hydrochloride and ascorbic acid may work better in treating patients with kidney&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate and compare treatment failure-free rate at 40 weeks from randomization of&#xD;
      patients with unresectable/metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) receiving one&#xD;
      of the following regimens: Arm A: pazopanib hydrochloride (pazopanib) 800 mg daily plus&#xD;
      intravenous (IV) ascorbic acid 1g/kg 3 times/week and Arm B: pazopanib 800 mg daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate and compare the overall survival (OS) in patients receiving pazopanib with or&#xD;
      without IV ascorbic acid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate and compare the progression-free survival (PFS) in patients receiving&#xD;
      pazopanib with or without IV ascorbic acid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To estimate and compare the overall response rate (ORR) in patients receiving pazopanib&#xD;
      with or without IV ascorbic acid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To estimate and compare the duration on pazopanib treatment in patients receiving&#xD;
      pazopanib with or without IV ascorbic acid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To assess the adverse events (AE) profile and safety of each treatment arm using the&#xD;
      Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE RESEARCH:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Correlation between 5 mC, 5 hmC and H3K27me3 expression (as determined by&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry [IHC]), as well as MeDIP/hMeDIP sequencing (seq), and response to&#xD;
      combination of IV ascorbic acid and pazopanib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Correlation between iron content in tumor microenvironment (as determined by Prussian&#xD;
      blue staining) and response to combination of IV ascorbic acid and pazopanib combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Correlation between HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha expression (as determined by&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry [IHC]) and response to combination of IV ascorbic acid and pazopanib&#xD;
      combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Correlation between GLUT1 expression (as determined by IHC) and response to combination&#xD;
      of IV ascorbic acid and pazopanib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Correlation between PDL1 expression (as determined by IHC) and response to combination of&#xD;
      IV ascorbic acid and pazopanib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and&#xD;
      ascorbic acid IV three times per week. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 10 cycles in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride PO QD on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every&#xD;
      28 days for up to 10 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 8 weeks for up to 2&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
