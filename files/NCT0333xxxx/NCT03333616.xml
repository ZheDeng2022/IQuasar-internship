  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a combination of drugs as a possible treatment for rare&#xD;
      genitourinary malignancies among four cohorts, bladder or upper tract carcinoma with variant&#xD;
      histology, adrenocortical carcinoma, other rare genitourinary carcinomas and any&#xD;
      genitourinary carcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation. Given preliminary results, the&#xD;
      study is being tested in additional patients with bladder or upper tract carcinoma with&#xD;
      variant histology at this time while the adrenocortical carcinoma, other rare genitourinary&#xD;
      malignancies arms have closed to accrual&#xD;
&#xD;
      -The names of the study drugs involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nivolumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ipilimumab&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the combination of drugs works&#xD;
      in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drugs are being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved nivolumab in combination&#xD;
      with ipilimumab for this specific disease but the combination is approved for use in melanoma&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are...&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigating the response of the participant's cancer to treatment with nivolumab plus&#xD;
           ipilimumab,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessing the safety of treatment with nivolumab and ipilimumab and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluating response and resistance to treatment by looking at the participant's tumor&#xD;
           tissue and blood for markers to predict response and resistance to therapy.&#xD;
