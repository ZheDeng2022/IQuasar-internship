      Objectives 1. Establish an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) bank for phenotypically&#xD;
      well-characterized patients with NF1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Develop isogenic NF1 wild-type (NF1+/+), NF1 heterozygous (NF1+/-) and NF1 homozygous&#xD;
      (NF1-/-) iPSC lines from individual patients using CRISPR/CAS9 technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Differentiate and characterize disease-relevant brain cells such as excitatory and&#xD;
      inhibitory neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes from patient-specific iPSC lines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Screen and identify the drug(s) that can reverse or alleviate the disease phenotypes.&#xD;

      Hypothesis: Subjects with NF1 and central nervous system tumors who have aggressive lesions&#xD;
      (including, but not limited to optic pathway gliomas) and/or those with tumors causing&#xD;
      neurologic (including visual) morbidity will manifest unique differences in their stem cells&#xD;
      and stem cell-derived differentiated cells compared to patients with NF1 and central nervous&#xD;
      system tumors who have less aggressive disease and/or those with tumors causing minimal to no&#xD;
      morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background and Significance: Optic pathway gliomas (OPGs) are low-grade astrocytic tumors&#xD;
      primarily involving the optic nerve, chiasm and tracts that occur mainly in children. Nearly&#xD;
      20% of children with Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) will develop OPGs, although less than&#xD;
      half will develop vision loss from their tumor.1 These tumors have excellent survival&#xD;
      outcomes, making vision loss the primary morbidity in these patients. Furthermore, OPGs are&#xD;
      inherent to the visual pathway, therefore they are rarely, if ever biopsied. This paucity of&#xD;
      OPG tissue limits our ability to clarify the biologic differences between OPGs that cause&#xD;
      vision loss and those that do not. Low-grade astrocytic gliomas in the other regions of the&#xD;
      brain including the hypothalamus, brainstem and cerebellum can also be found in a subset of&#xD;
      children associated with NF1. These NF1-associated brain tumors can progress and also grow at&#xD;
      variable rates and may cause neurologic dysfunction ranging from severe compromise to little&#xD;
      or no symptomality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study seeks to develop stem cells lines in children with NF1-related tumors in the&#xD;
      central nervous system (the optic nerve and those from other brain sites). Stem cells from&#xD;
      these subjects will provide a critical insight into the mechanisms responsible for tumor&#xD;
      progression and symptoms associated with the central nervous system, accelerating the&#xD;
      identification of therapeutic targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary Studies: Three recent research developments make it possible to develop a&#xD;
      patient-specific disease model in a dish (so-called &quot;human disease model in dish&quot;) and to&#xD;
      study induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived disease relevant cells in an isogenic&#xD;
      background. First, embryonic stem cell (ESC)-like cells, also known as induced pluripotent&#xD;
      stem cell or iPSC, can be generated from skin or blood cells in adult patients. Second,&#xD;
      recent research efforts have started to develop culture protocols that differentiate iPSCs&#xD;
      into a variety of cell types in the central and peripheral nervous system (CNS and PNS),&#xD;
      which are affected in NF1 patients. Third, the CRISPR/CAS9 technology allows to genetically&#xD;
      edit the specific disease genes either by repairing the existing mutant genes or creating new&#xD;
      mutations. In order to position at the forefront of NF1 research, it will be important for&#xD;
      the Gilbert Family Neurofibromatosis Institute (GFNI) at the Children's National Medical&#xD;
      Center to explore these recent exciting research developments, to systematically develop&#xD;
      patient-specific human NF1 disease models, and to provide a tool for drug screening and&#xD;
      evaluation on the individual NF patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1 Study Design Cross-sectional collection of NF1 subjects with tumors in the central&#xD;
      nervous system as documented by MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 Study Visits Subjects will have only one visit to collect the blood sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3 Study Procedures 3.31 Blood Draw Subjects have 20 ml of whole blood drawn during either&#xD;
      1)their sedation for their clinically indicated MRI (IV already being placed for clinical&#xD;
      purpose) or through the outpatient laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.32 Stem Cell Processing Blood collected will be immediately transferred to the stem cell&#xD;
      facility at the National Institutes of Health for processing of the specimens in order to&#xD;
      develop stem cell lines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.33 Demographics We will collect the subject's age, gender, race, ethnicity, location of&#xD;
      tumors in the central nervous system on MRI, history of vision loss and other neurological&#xD;
      deficits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.34 Statistical Analysis As a first step to establish a stem cell library from a specific&#xD;
      population of NF1 children with nervous system tumors, we will not need statistical analysis&#xD;
      at this stage.&#xD;
