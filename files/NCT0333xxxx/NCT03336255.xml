  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research show that South Asians (SA) have a high burden of Cardio Vascular Disease (CVD) risk&#xD;
      factors of which, poor diet and physical inactivity remain the major lifestyle risk factors&#xD;
      in SA. Intensive diet and physical activity behavioral interventions have been shown to yield&#xD;
      improvements across a variety of intermediate cardiovascular health outcomes (blood pressure,&#xD;
      cholesterol, glycated hemoglobin, weight) in persons with CVD risk factors and are&#xD;
      recommended by national guidelines. However, the investigators prior research found that&#xD;
      existing interventions are not reaching SA. First, the usual framing of behavioral risk&#xD;
      factor interventions in terms of the biomedical model of CVD is mismatched to SA explanatory&#xD;
      models, which emphasize psychosocial causes of CVD. Next, few interventions are tailored to&#xD;
      the sociocultural patterns shared by much of the SA community. Interventions that address the&#xD;
      individual and shared sociocultural drivers of CVD risk are needed to maximize reach and&#xD;
      effectiveness in the high risk and rapidly growing SA population. The proposed study builds&#xD;
      on the strong foundation of the South Asian Healthy Lifestyle Initiative (SAHELI), which has&#xD;
      a 9-year history of using community-based participatory research to design and test&#xD;
      culturally tailored, community-based interventions to reduce CVD disparities in SA. To date,&#xD;
      SAHELI has engaged multi-sectoral partners, established relationships of trust, and defined&#xD;
      mutually beneficial goals. The investigators also culturally adapted the SAHELI lifestyle&#xD;
      intervention to (a) address the individual and sociocultural determinants of CVD risk in SA;&#xD;
      and (b) increase components of self-regulation (motivation, self-monitoring, goal setting)&#xD;
      that are most effective in eliciting diet and physical activity changes.Hence, the SAHELI&#xD;
      intervention integrates evidence-based behavior change techniques with the shared the&#xD;
      sociocultural processes salient to SA. A pilot study (n=63) established feasibility of the&#xD;
      SAHELI intervention, had a 100% retention rate, and reduced glycated hemoglobin and weight&#xD;
      among intervention participants compared to a control group. Based on this preliminary&#xD;
      evidence of efficacy and a process evaluation, the investigators modified select components&#xD;
      of the intervention for the proposed trial. Study team increased the intervention contact&#xD;
      hours, piloted additional diet and exercise content, and included family. The proposed study&#xD;
      will use a hybrid trial type 1 design to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and&#xD;
      implementation potential of the culturally tailored, community-based lifestyle intervention&#xD;
      in a larger, more generalizable at-risk SA population. Study team is uniquely positioned to&#xD;
      fill a critical gap in work (a) demonstrating the cultural adaptation of evidence-based&#xD;
      lifestyle interventions, and (b) evaluating the effectiveness of the SAHELI intervention in&#xD;
      reducing CVD risk in SA living in the U.S.&#xD;
