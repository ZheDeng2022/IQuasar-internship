  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The operation to remove certain pancreatic cancers (Whipple procedure), even in 2017, remains&#xD;
      one of the most complicated surgeries done in the abdomen. It carries a 50% chance of a&#xD;
      complication, even in the world's largest pancreatic surgery centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saskatchewan is one of only two centres in Canada to have a promising new technology called&#xD;
      Irreversible Electroporation (IRE) (NanoKnifeÂ®) available to our patients for the ablation&#xD;
      (destruction) of cancers. IRE is different from other ablation treatments, including heat and&#xD;
      even radiation, in that with IRE no heat is generated and there is minimal, if any, damage to&#xD;
      nearby blood vessels, bowel, and ducts. Thus far, IRE has only been used as a &quot;last resort&quot;&#xD;
      in cases where the pancreatic cancer cannot be removed with surgery, yet many patients whose&#xD;
      tumor could likely be removed with a 'Whipple' have expressed a preference to undergo IRE&#xD;
      instead of the Whipple procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our main research questions are: In comparison to Whipple procedure, is IRE an effective&#xD;
      treatment of pancreatic cancer, and are complications reduced? Is IRE cost-effective? Based&#xD;
      on the cases we have done and published series of IRE for stage III pancreatic cancer, we&#xD;
      believe that IRE will be effective and safe in treating lesser stage (I and II) tumors in our&#xD;
      proposed study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a pilot study of 12-15 patients, and all recruited patients will receive the IRE&#xD;
      treatment and then be followed for up to 5 years for quality of life, recurrence, survival,&#xD;
      and cost.&#xD;

      -  Subjects will receive a general anesthetic and will undergo a midline laparotomy and a&#xD;
           careful inspection to ensure no distant metastases are obvious in the peritoneal cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ultrasound-guided IRE of the pancreatic mass will be performed by interventional&#xD;
           radiologist Dr. Chris Wall as per the protocol of Martin et al [ ].&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will be monitored for adverse events in the postoperative period until the time&#xD;
           of discharge from the hospital, typically on the 5th or 6th day after the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adjuvant chemotherapy is recommended following the procedure but it is not mandatory.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be assessed and offered single agent gemcitabine or combination of&#xD;
           gemcitabine and capecitabine at the discretion of treating oncologists. It is&#xD;
           recommended that patients begin treatment within 12 weeks after the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specific drug reductions and management of will be made in accordance with the published&#xD;
           recommendations for gemcitabine or gemcitabine plus capecitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be scheduled for regular follow up and surveillance history and physical&#xD;
           exam by the Hepatobiliary Surgeons Group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The same surveillance protocol that is used after the Whipple procedure will be&#xD;
           followed: bloodwork at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months (complete blood count,&#xD;
           electrolytes, creatinine, liver enzymes, Ca 19.9) and imaging (Chest Xray and CT abdomen&#xD;
           at 3 months, followed by a PET scan at 6 months, CT scan at 9 and 12 months, then yearly&#xD;
           CT or MRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For study purposes, each scan will be re-reviewed by the same two radiologists with a&#xD;
           goal of arriving at a consensus in each case.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two validated QOL questionnaires, the FACT-Hep, which is specific to hepatic and&#xD;
           pancreatic diseases, and the more general FACT-G questionnaire will be administered&#xD;
           preoperatively and at 3 and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each IRE case will be matched 2:1 with patients undergoing the Whipple Procedure around&#xD;
           the same time (within 12 months of each other) for non-locally advanced pancreatic&#xD;
           cancer, matched by age +/- 5 years, gender, tumor size +/- 0.5 cm, and preoperative&#xD;
           chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Survival curves will be analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method, and differences between&#xD;
           groups will be assessed using log-rank test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Student's T test and the Mann-Whitney U test will be used for other comparisons between&#xD;
           the two groups and p&lt;0.05 will be taken to be significant. SPSS version 24 will be used&#xD;
           for statistical analyses (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL).&#xD;
