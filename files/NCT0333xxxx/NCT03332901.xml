      General anesthesia may predispose patients to aspiration of gastroesophageal contents because&#xD;
      of depression of protective reflexes during loss of consciousness. The laparoscopy would&#xD;
      increase the intra-abdominal pressure, which is regarded as a predisposing factor of&#xD;
      gastroesophageal reflux during the anesthesia. The lower esophageal sphincter is the&#xD;
      important physiological mechanisms that prevent regurgitation and aspiration. However, the&#xD;
      change of LES pressure and gastroesophageal reflux before and after laparoscopic&#xD;
      physiological condition is still unknown because the prospective evaluation of&#xD;
      gastroesophageal function in human is limited. In addition, the relationship between the&#xD;
      change of intra-abdominal pressure and the LES pressure were still unknown, too. In this&#xD;
      study, we aimed to observe the changes of gastroesophgeal function parameters by esophageal&#xD;
      manometry, pH impedance, and intra-abdominal pressure measured by AbViser ®AutoValve®IAP&#xD;
      Monitoring Device before and after laparoscopic condition.&#xD;

      Background: General anesthesia may predispose patients to aspiration of gastroesophageal&#xD;
      contents because of depression of protective reflexes during loss of consciousness. The&#xD;
      laparoscopy would increase the intra-abdominal pressure, which is regarded as a predisposing&#xD;
      factor of gastroesophageal reflux during the anesthesia. The lower esophageal sphincter is&#xD;
      the important physiological mechanisms that prevent regurgitation and aspiration. However,&#xD;
      the change of LES pressure and gastroesophageal reflux before and after laparoscopic&#xD;
      physiological condition is still unknown because the prospective evaluation of&#xD;
      gastroesophageal function in human is limited. In addition, the relationship between the&#xD;
      change of intra-abdominal pressure and the LES pressure were still unknown, too.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The esophageal manometry has pressure sensor to measure the LES pressure. The AbViser&#xD;
      ®AutoValve®IAP Monitoring Device is a sterile non-invasive disposable monitoring device, that&#xD;
      is routinely used to measure intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) in the intensive care unit.&#xD;
      Therefore, application of esophageal manometry and pH impedance via second-generation SADs&#xD;
      may help to detect gastroesophageal functional change and ongoing gastroesophageal&#xD;
      regurgitation during perioperative period. We also used the AbViser ®AutoValve®IAP Monitoring&#xD;
      Device to monitor the change of IAP before and after laparoscopic condition. In this study,&#xD;
      we aimed to observe the changes of gastroesophgeal function parameters by esophageal&#xD;
      manometry and intra-abdominal pressure measured by AbViser ®AutoValve®IAP Monitoring Device&#xD;
      before and after laparoscopic condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: we aimed to observe the changes of gastroesophgeal function parameters by&#xD;
      esophageal manometry, pH impedance, and intra-abdominal pressure measured by AbViser&#xD;
      ®AutoValve®IAP Monitoring Device before and after laparoscopic condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and methods: Consecutive patients who will receive scheduled laparoscopic surgery&#xD;
      under general anesthesia and aged &gt;= 20 will be enrolled. All subjects provide basic&#xD;
      demographic data and fill in standard symptom questionnaire for evaluation of baseline upper&#xD;
      gastrointestinal symptoms. After induction, the endotracheal tube (ETT) will be inserted to&#xD;
      establish airway. Then, the esophageal manometry would be inserted to monitor the LES, and&#xD;
      the AbViser ®AutoValve®IAP Monitoring Device will be inserted to monitor the IAP before and&#xD;
      after the laparoscopic condition. After the surgery and removal of ETT, the patients will be&#xD;
      followed for the oxygen saturation, sore throat or hoarseness in the postoperative care unit,&#xD;
      as well as the possible complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected result: We will observe the changes of LES function, gastroesophageal reflux and the&#xD;
      relationship between the IAP and the LES function before and after the laparoscopic&#xD;
      condition.&#xD;
