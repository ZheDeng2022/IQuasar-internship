  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of paclitaxel&#xD;
      that can be given as hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) to patients with&#xD;
      gastric or gastroesophageal cancer. HIPEC is a system in which heated chemotherapy is&#xD;
      delivered directly inside the abdomen during surgery. In this study, paclitaxel is being&#xD;
      combined with mitomycin and cisplatin to see if this study drug combination can help to&#xD;
      control the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Mitomycin, cisplatin, and paclitaxel are FDA-approved and&#xD;
      commercially available for the treatment of gastric and gastroesophageal cancer. It is&#xD;
      investigational to give these drugs by HIPEC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study doctor can describe how the study drugs and HIPEC are designed to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 48 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.&#xD;

      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, participant will be&#xD;
      assigned to a dose level of paclitaxel based on when participant joins this study. Up to 8&#xD;
      dose levels of paclitaxel will be tested. Up to 6 participants will be enrolled at each dose&#xD;
      level. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new group&#xD;
      will receive a higher dose than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were&#xD;
      seen. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of paclitaxel is found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive the same dose level of mitomycin and cisplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIPEC Treatment and Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of HIPEC treatment, participant will receive heated mitomycin, cisplatin, and&#xD;
      paclitaxel as a liquid that is injected through 3 to 4 small incisions in participant's&#xD;
      abdomen over about 1 hour. Heated mitomycin, cisplatin, and paclitaxel will be delivered&#xD;
      through plastic tubing that is connected to a pump into the abdominal cavity. The pump pushes&#xD;
      the heated drugs into the abdominal cavity and then pulls it out and recirculates the drugs.&#xD;
      The skin of the abdominal cavity is temporarily closed during this procedure. A pump will be&#xD;
      used to pump the heated drugs in and out of the abdominal cavity over 60 minutes while the&#xD;
      surgeon gently presses on the abdominal wall so the drugs can reach all areas in the&#xD;
      abdominal cavity. After 60 minutes, the drugs are removed and the abdominal cavity will be&#xD;
      washed. The remaining fluid will be removed before the surgeon closes the abdominal cavity&#xD;
      with stitches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, participant will be given standard drugs to help decrease the risk of side&#xD;
      effects. Participant may ask the study staff for information about how the drugs are given&#xD;
      and their risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant will remain in the hospital for 3-7 days after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While participant is in the hospital after surgery, blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) may be&#xD;
      drawn for routine tests at any time that the study doctor thinks it is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One (1) time between 2-6 weeks after HIPEC Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant will have routine clinic visits or participant will be called every 6 months&#xD;
      after the HIPEC procedure. Participant will be asked about any other cancer treatments&#xD;
      participant may be receiving. If participant is called, these calls should last about 5-10&#xD;
      minutes. If participant stopped the study early, the study doctor may ask participant to&#xD;
      return to the clinic for extra CT scans, PET scan, or MRIs during the follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant will have a CT scan, PET scan, or MRI of participant's chest, abdomen, and pelvis&#xD;
      every 6 months for 5 years after surgery to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study Participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant will be on study for about 5 years after participant's last procedure (HIPEC or&#xD;
      surgery). Participant will be taken off study early if the disease gets worse, if intolerable&#xD;
      side effects occur, or if participant is unable to follow study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.&#xD;
