  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of PPFP Choices is to generate actionable evidence that can be used to&#xD;
      increase programmatic activities to address post-pregnancy family planning in the public and&#xD;
      private-for-profit sectors. The ultimate intent of this investment is to advance and scale up&#xD;
      post-pregnancy FP. Programmatic learning will be crucial to understanding what it will take&#xD;
      to accelerate post-pregnancy FP in these two countries, and these can later be adapted by&#xD;
      other countries with similar settings. Our vision of PPFP Choices can be achieved through the&#xD;
      following objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective 1: Establish a comprehensive program implementation framework for the private&#xD;
           sector to embrace post-pregnancy FP&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective 2: Improve the quality of post-pregnancy FP counseling and service provision&#xD;
           in both public and private sectors&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective 3: Build evidence and contribute to the literature and programmatic guidance&#xD;
           around post-pregnancy FP uptake and continuation in both public and private sectors&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective 4: Ensure effective documentation and strategic dissemination which will&#xD;
           benefit post-pregnancy FP introduction and scale-up more broadly&#xD;

      PPFP Choices is an operations research study seeking to examine the barriers and facilitators&#xD;
      in offering a full range of FP methods in the immediate post-pregnancy period in both the&#xD;
      public and private sectors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Jhpiego will implement the study in two counties in Kenya; Meru and Kilifi, and two districts&#xD;
      in Indonesia; Brebes and Batang.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will employ a quasi-experimental design with an intervention and control group.&#xD;
      Prior to study start-up, the the intervention group will receive a Jhpiego-designed package&#xD;
      of interventions designed to advance post-pregnancy FP in both the public and private&#xD;
      sectors. These interventions draw on WHO's Programming Strategies for Postpartum Family&#xD;
      Planning, as well as Jhpiego's experience and assessments. After the study is completed, the&#xD;
      control groups will receive the same intervention. For the study, a mixed method approach&#xD;
      will be used; both quantitative and qualitative data will be collected through Client&#xD;
      Quantitative Interviews, Client In-Depth interviews, Focus Group Discussions, Key Informant&#xD;
      Interviews, and Facility Assessments.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention will be applied to health facilities in one district in Indonesia and one county in Kenya. The intervention package will work within existing public and private health facilities to strengthen and assess the effectiveness of facility and provider level PPFP service provision and counseling, and expand method choice for women during antenatal, early labor, and post-pregnancy pre-discharge periods. Training within the intervention package include provider-lever PPFP counseling and service provision (PPFP Clinical and Counseling Skills), as well as provider and facility-level leadership management and governance training (Facility-Level Leadership Management and Governance Training).</description>
