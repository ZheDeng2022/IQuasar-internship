  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The EPIC-HF study will test the effectiveness of a patient empowerment and activation for&#xD;
      optimization of Heart Failure with reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF) medication plans. Three&#xD;
      main regional centers in the University of Colorado Health (UCHealth) system will participate&#xD;
      in a two-arm, randomized study design. In this design, each site participates in both control&#xD;
      and intervention, with members of the sites eligible patient population randomly enrolled in&#xD;
      either the intervention or the control arm. All eligible patients who agree to participate in&#xD;
      the study will complete the Baseline Survey, the Follow-Up Survey, and will have information&#xD;
      collected from their medical record at baseline, 1 month after the first clinic appointment&#xD;
      post-enrollment, and 1 year after enrollment. Enrollment will take place at three UCHealth&#xD;
      locations: UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital (Metro), UCHealth Medical Center of the&#xD;
      Rockies and UCHealth Poudre Valley Hospital (North), and UCHealth Memorial Central and&#xD;
      Memorial North (South). Study personnel at the North and South sites will carry out&#xD;
      enrollment and Baseline Surveys with patients for those locations; all other study procedures&#xD;
      will be conducted by study personnel at the University of Colorado (UC) School of Medicine&#xD;
      (SOM) (UCSOM) at UCHealth University of Colorado School of Medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in the intervention arm will receive, by email and/or text, a link to 1) a&#xD;
      short patient engagement video around HFrEF medications, and 2) a link to an online portable&#xD;
      document format (PDF) of a HFrEF medication checklist. Patients in the intervention arm will&#xD;
      receive these materials after enrollment and one week prior to their next scheduled clinic&#xD;
      appointment. The materials will be delivered in a second communication, three days after the&#xD;
      first, via text, as well as a third communication on the day of the clinic appointment.&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in the control arm will not receive any materials at any point of time and&#xD;
      will receive their usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both arms, medication changes in patient medical records will be assessed before and&#xD;
      after clinic visits to measure the effectiveness of the intervention on aim 1; surveys will&#xD;
      be compared before and after clinic visits to determine the effectiveness of the intervention&#xD;
      on aim 2.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple medications improve left ventricular remodeling, quality of life, and survival in&#xD;
      patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Unfortunately, the&#xD;
      real-world use of HFrEF medications is suboptimal, particularly for more recently approved&#xD;
      agents such as aldosterone antagonists. The introduction of sacubitril/valsartan and&#xD;
      ivabradine add to already complex HFrEF treatment regimens. Without novel mechanisms to&#xD;
      improve medication use, the benefits of advances in HF treatment will be largely unrealized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efforts to optimize HFrEF medication delivery have focused primarily on 1) provider decision&#xD;
      support around prescribing and 2) patient education around adherence. An important gap is the&#xD;
      failure to empower patients to engage more directly in HFrEF prescribing efforts. Patients&#xD;
      have a direct stake in making sure they are getting efficacious treatments, want to be&#xD;
      involved in decisions about their treatments, and if engaged are more likely to adhere to&#xD;
      them. Direct-to-consumer marketing and proliferation of shared decision making reflect a&#xD;
      culture where patients are increasingly involved in medication prescribing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within this context, the American Heart Association (AHA) has funded four centers across the&#xD;
      United States to examine ways in which heart failure treatment and prevention may be&#xD;
      optimized. The University of Colorado, Denver is one of these sites; The Development and&#xD;
      Trial of an Electronic health record-leveraged, Patient-centered, Intensification of Chronic&#xD;
      care for Heart Failure Tool (EPIC-HF) is the population-focused arm of study. Inspired by the&#xD;
      gap in HFrEF medication optimization, this study aims to develop a patient-centered&#xD;
      intervention in order to 1) activate and engage patients with HFrEF in their prescribing&#xD;
      regimen, 2) empower them to initiate discussions with their provider about ways in which&#xD;
      their medication plan could be improved, which will result in 3) a superior HFrEF medication&#xD;
      plan. The investigators modeled this tool with the previous success of flipped classrooms and&#xD;
      patient empowerment initiatives in mind. The intervention was iteratively developed with the&#xD;
      input of both clinician and patient stakeholders, and is innovative in its emphasis on&#xD;
      patient self-actualization and role as an equal with their healthcare provider in the&#xD;
      discussion around medication prescribing. This study applies the intervention in a two-arm,&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial across three sites (UCHealth metro, Memorial, and Medical Center&#xD;
      of the Rockies) in the UCHealth medical system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Assess the effectiveness of the EPIC-HF intervention on HFrEF medication optimization&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Compared to usual care, EPIC-HF will increase the number of HFrEF medication&#xD;
      optimizations (i.e., dose changes for beta-blockers (Î²B), Angiotensin-converting enzyme&#xD;
      inhibitors (ACE-I)/Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB)/sacubitril, Aldosterone Receptor&#xD;
      Antagonists (AldaA), Ivabradine, etc.) without compromising secondary outcomes including&#xD;
      safety and healthcare provider satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Assess the effectiveness of the EPIC-HF intervention on patient empowerment and&#xD;
      activation around their HFrEF medication plan Hypothesis 2: Compared to usual care, EPIC-HF&#xD;
      will result in increased patient empowerment and activation around their HFrEF medication&#xD;
      plan as measured through patient self-assessment&#xD;

    <description>The investigators were interested in whether the patient engagement tool led to an increase in the optimization of HFrEF medications for patients. This was measured through medical record review of all medications and doses immediately preceding the cardiology clinic visit (enrollment) to 30 days after enrollment.</description>

    <measure>Self-Reported Patient Engagement Around HFrEF Medications</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month after delivery of intervention materials.</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators were interested in whether the patient engagement tool (a 3-minute video and 1-page checklist-delivered electronically 1 week prior, 3 days prior and 24 hours prior to the enrollment cardiology clinic visit) led to an increase in patient sense of engagement around their HFrEF medication prescribing, prompting patients to begin a dialogue with their clinician about their medication plan. This was assessed among the Intervention group by comparing answers from a self-reported survey at 1 month after delivery of intervention materials. Participants were sent the survey and asked if they received and reviewed the intervention materials. Survey measures were included as well as a series of questions asking about how and when medications were discussed during clinical interactions.</description>

        <description>The investigators were interested in whether the patient engagement tool (a 3-minute video and 1-page checklist-delivered electronically 1 week prior, 3 days prior and 24 hours prior to the enrollment cardiology clinic visit) led to an increase in patient sense of engagement around their HFrEF medication prescribing, prompting patients to begin a dialogue with their clinician about their medication plan. This was assessed among the Intervention group by comparing answers from a self-reported survey at 1 month after delivery of intervention materials. Participants were sent the survey and asked if they received and reviewed the intervention materials. Survey measures were included as well as a series of questions asking about how and when medications were discussed during clinical interactions.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>We did not measure intolerance and contraindications to GDMT. Randomization occurred at the patient-level rather than the clinician- or site-level, which allowed for potential contamination. Only cardiology specialists were included in this study. The use of a single, regional health system may further limit generalizability. However University of Colorado Health is a diverse system spanning a range of local care approaches, and we over-enrolled under-represented patient groups where possible.</limitations_and_caveats>
