    <description>Anaphylaxis is likely when any 1 of the 3 following sets of criteria is fulfilled:&#xD;
Acute onset of an illness (minutes to hours) with involvement of: (a) Skin/mucosal tissue (eg, generalized hives, itch/flush, swollen lips/tongue/uvula); AND (b) Airway compromise (eg, dyspnea, stridor, wheeze/bronchospasm, hypoxia, reduced PEFR); AND/OR (c) Reduced BP or associated symptoms (eg, hypotonia, syncope, incontinence).&#xD;
Two or more of the following that occur rapidly after exposure to the allergen (minutes to hours): (a) Skin/mucosal tissue; (b) Airway compromise; (c) Reduced BP or associated symptoms; (d) Persistent GI symptoms (eg, nausea, vomiting, crampy abdominal pain).&#xD;
Reduced BP after exposure to the allergen (minutes to hours). Infants and children: low systolic BP (age-specific) or &gt; 30% drop in systolic BP; Adults: systolic BP &lt; 90 mm Hg or &gt; 30% drop from their baseline.</description>

        <description>Anaphylaxis is likely when any 1 of the 3 following sets of criteria is fulfilled:&#xD;
Acute onset of an illness (minutes to hours) with involvement of: (a) Skin/mucosal tissue (eg, generalized hives, itch/flush, swollen lips/tongue/uvula); AND (b) Airway compromise (eg, dyspnea, stridor, wheeze/bronchospasm, hypoxia, reduced PEFR); AND/OR (c) Reduced BP or associated symptoms (eg, hypotonia, syncope, incontinence).&#xD;
Two or more of the following that occur rapidly after exposure to the allergen (minutes to hours): (a) Skin/mucosal tissue; (b) Airway compromise; (c) Reduced BP or associated symptoms; (d) Persistent GI symptoms (eg, nausea, vomiting, crampy abdominal pain).&#xD;
Reduced BP after exposure to the allergen (minutes to hours). Infants and children: low systolic BP (age-specific) or &gt; 30% drop in systolic BP; Adults: systolic BP &lt; 90 mm Hg or &gt; 30% drop from their baseline.</description>
