    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the investigational treatment, MHOS/SHP615, is&#xD;
      safe and effective in children with status epilepticus (SE) (convulsive) in the community&#xD;
      setting. This study is open-label extension for patients who completed the SHP615-301 study&#xD;

    <description>Oxygen saturation is the amount of oxygen that is in bloodstream and is measured as the percentage of blood hemoglobin that is carrying oxygen. Normal oxygen saturation levels are considered to be 95-100 percent; low oxygen saturation values indicate worse disease. Oxygen saturation was measured and recorded on room air. The investigator recorded the oxygen saturation as well as the oxygen delivery system and amount of oxygen administered during hospital setting. Percentage of participants with normal oxygen saturation values collected during hospital setting were reported.</description>

        <title>Safety: Percentage of Participants With Normal Oxygen Saturation Values Collected During Hospital Setting</title>
        <description>Oxygen saturation is the amount of oxygen that is in bloodstream and is measured as the percentage of blood hemoglobin that is carrying oxygen. Normal oxygen saturation levels are considered to be 95-100 percent; low oxygen saturation values indicate worse disease. Oxygen saturation was measured and recorded on room air. The investigator recorded the oxygen saturation as well as the oxygen delivery system and amount of oxygen administered during hospital setting. Percentage of participants with normal oxygen saturation values collected during hospital setting were reported.</description>

        <population>Safety set consisted of all participants who had received a single dose of IP, regardless of whether the study drug administration was documented to be complete or not on the study drug administration eCRF.</population>
