  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Communities for Healthy Living (CHL) program is a family-focused intervention to promote&#xD;
      healthy lifestyle behaviors including diet and physical activity among children (age 3-to&#xD;
      5-years) and their families, enrolled in Head Start.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This evaluation will test the effectiveness of a family-focused intervention, Communities for&#xD;
      Healthy Living (CHL), implemented through Head Start. Over 20% of preschool-aged children in&#xD;
      the US experience overweight or obese. Because obesity prevention depends heavily on the&#xD;
      adoption of healthy lifestyle behaviors early in life, preventive efforts offer a higher&#xD;
      promise for success if they are family-centered. Effective family-centered interventions for&#xD;
      obesity prevention in preschool-aged children, however, remain elusive. While a number of&#xD;
      interventions have shown positive effects on child Body Mass Index (BMI), results are&#xD;
      inconsistent and short term effects are not maintained. What is more, because families at&#xD;
      greatest risk of childhood obesity - including low-income, single-parent, and ethnic minority&#xD;
      families - are the most difficult to recruit and retain, results are often limited in their&#xD;
      applicability to high risk populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In response, the researchers have partnered with Head Start to develop and test a new&#xD;
      approach to family-centered childhood obesity prevention that addresses family engagement&#xD;
      upfront. The CHL program will be refined and rigorously tested for efficacy in collaboration&#xD;
      with Head Start programs in the greater Boston area, which collectively serve over 2000&#xD;
      low-income children each year. Building on a previous pilot study, the investigators will&#xD;
      broaden the parent-centered Community Based Participatory Research approach and include Head&#xD;
      Start staff in the decision making and implementation process, refine intervention&#xD;
      components, and expand technical assistance protocols to support Head Start ownership of CHL&#xD;
      while ensuring implementation fidelity. In addition, consistent with the overarching&#xD;
      theoretical framework (Family Ecological Model), neighborhood-level socioeconomic, food and&#xD;
      physical activity environments around family homes and examine their impact on intervention&#xD;
      outcomes will be measured to inform future scale up efforts.&#xD;

  <why_stopped>
    The primary trial was halted due to covid-19 in the last 6 months of the trial; as a result,&#xD;
    the intervention was not fully implemented and the final outcomes were not measured. Outcomes&#xD;
    will be assessed with the data available (BL, Y1, Y2).&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The stepped wedge design is a pragmatic design that is well suited for interventions that use a service delivery protocol and do not rely on individual recruitment of participants. The intervention is integrated into Head Start service delivery and data compiled for all enrolled children are used to evaluate the intervention. NOTE: Due to COVID-19 shutdown the final group of Head Start programs did receive the full intervention. The investigators elected to assess intervention impact with one year less data than expected. Due to low power, sensitivity analyses will examine the roles of dose, fidelity, baseline child overweight/obesity.</intervention_model_description>

In 2020-2021, PConnect was implemented virtually; these are pilot data and not part of the main trial.</description>

    <description>Enhanced Nutrition Support: Existing nutrition resources within Head Start (e.g., Biannual child health letters) are expanded and improved to ensure parents are aware of their child's weight status and are linked with age-appropriate weight management services if their child has overweight or obesity. NOTE: Enhanced nutrition support was not implemented in spring 2020 due to the pandemic. In 2020-2021, it was moved to a virtual format in what will be a pilot virtual trial.</description>
