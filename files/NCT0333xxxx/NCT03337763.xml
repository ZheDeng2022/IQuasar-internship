  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Enrolled patients implanted with Biotronik CRT-D and QP lead equipped with MultiPole pacing&#xD;
      mode is grouped into which programmed into MultiPole pacing, or conventional bi-ventricular&#xD;
      pacing mode. They are followed up by seven month post implantation, and predefined cardiac&#xD;
      functional parameters are collected at each visit.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Enrolled patients will undergo the baseline medical tests to assess the cardiac functions&#xD;
      (e.g. echo, blood test, and 12-Lead ECG) prior to the implantation of Biotronik CRT-D and QP&#xD;
      lead featured with MultiPole Pacing parameter. At implantation, LV-LV conduction delays are&#xD;
      measured in predefined LV pacing and sensing configurations. One month after the successful&#xD;
      implantation, the patients revisit the investigation site to be adjudicated for programming&#xD;
      MultiPole pacing or continuing bi-ventricular pacing mode, based on their echo readings by&#xD;
      then. Patients are subsequently followed up at four and seven month post implantation to&#xD;
      acquire the LV-LV conduction delays and echo readings, etc. at the time.&#xD;
