  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test how safe and effective the research study drug,&#xD;
      pembrolizumab is as a treatment for patients with Hodgkin lymphoma who have not previously&#xD;
      been treated for this disease and are unsuitable for standard treatment (adriamycin,&#xD;
      bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine ABVD).&#xD;
    </textblock>

      The study is a single arm, open label, phase II, international, multi-centre study. Sample&#xD;
      size will be 25 evaluable patients with a recruitment period of 2 years. Patients will be&#xD;
      administered 200mg pembrolizumab IV every 3 weeks up to 35 cycles or 2 years. Patients will&#xD;
      be followed-up for 1 year.&#xD;

             meningitis. Patients with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided&#xD;
             they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least four weeks&#xD;
             prior to registration and any neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline), have no&#xD;
             evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using steroids for at least&#xD;
             7 days prior to registration. This exception does not include carcinomatous meningitis&#xD;
