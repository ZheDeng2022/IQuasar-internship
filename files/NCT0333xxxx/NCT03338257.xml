  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since 1998, UCONN undergraduate students have volunteered as part of a service- learning&#xD;
      course to deliver a program called Husky Reads. Inspired by the nationally accepted American&#xD;
      Academy of Pediatrics' program &quot;Reach Out and Read,&quot; Husky Reads was first designed for&#xD;
      promotion of health, nutrition habits and literacy by reading health-oriented books to young&#xD;
      children in pediatric and health clinics. The Husky Reads curriculum now includes a series of&#xD;
      10 lessons designed to introduce preschool-age children to MyPlate while improving fruit and&#xD;
      vegetable literacy. Undergraduate students enrolled in the Husky Reads service- learning&#xD;
      course at UConn or college students participating in the paid summer internship program&#xD;
      deliver the preschool lessons. Each team of 2-3 undergraduate students is assigned 2-3 early&#xD;
      care classrooms to visit and deliver Husky Reads lessons to on a weekly basis. This series&#xD;
      targets children at an early age because early childhood is a pivotal time to influence the&#xD;
      path towards healthy behaviors and away from obesity. The effectiveness of the Husky Reads&#xD;
      curriculum on a preschool age child's correct identification and liking of fruits and&#xD;
      vegetables has not been established. The proposed evaluation uses a pre-test/post- test&#xD;
      control group design with paired data at the child level to explore whether children who&#xD;
      participate in Husky Reads have increased odds of correctly identifying the United States&#xD;
      Department of Agriculture (USDA) &quot;MyPlate&quot; program (MyPlate) and food group concepts and&#xD;
      trying or liking select fruits and vegetables.&#xD;

      Since 1998, University of Connecticut (UCONN) undergraduate students have volunteered as part&#xD;
      of a service- learning course to deliver a program called Husky Reads. Inspired by the&#xD;
      nationally accepted American Academy of Pediatrics' program &quot;Reach Out and Read,&quot; Husky Reads&#xD;
      was first designed for promotion of health, nutrition habits and literacy by reading&#xD;
      health-oriented books to young children in pediatric and health clinics. The Husky Reads&#xD;
      curriculum now includes a series of 10 lessons designed to introduce preschool-age children&#xD;
      to MyPlate while improving fruit and vegetable literacy. Each lesson includes reading at&#xD;
      least one children's book, an activity or game, and food tasting to complement learning&#xD;
      objectives related to MyPlate and fruit/vegetable literacy. Undergraduate students enrolled&#xD;
      in the Husky Reads service- learning course at UConn or college students participating in the&#xD;
      paid summer internship program deliver the preschool lessons. Each team of 2-3 undergraduate&#xD;
      students is assigned 2-3 early care classrooms to visit and deliver Husky Reads lessons to on&#xD;
      a weekly basis. This series targets children at an early age because early childhood is a&#xD;
      pivotal time to influence the path towards healthy behaviors and away from obesity. Providing&#xD;
      food tastings and increasing exposure to foods like fruits and vegetables is especially&#xD;
      relevant because food preferences are developed in early childhood. Early childhood is also&#xD;
      an important time for introducing healthy behaviors because once obesity is established in&#xD;
      childhood; it often tracks through to adulthood and is difficult to reverse through&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness of the Husky Reads curriculum on a preschool age child's MyPlate knowledge&#xD;
      and correct identification and liking of fruits and vegetables has not been established. A&#xD;
      more comprehensive evaluation is needed to establish if the program is effective and&#xD;
      contributes to quality improvement efforts. Findings from a prior evaluation suggest the&#xD;
      ability of preschoolers to identify blueberries, strawberries, carrots and broccoli increased&#xD;
      significantly after participation in one Husky Reads lesson. Although the findings were&#xD;
      promising, the evaluation design lacked a control group and relied on a classroom wide&#xD;
      assessment with hands raised as a response rather than measuring whether the ability to&#xD;
      identify the produce items changed for a given child after participation in Husky Reads.&#xD;
      Therefore, a more thorough evaluation of whether Husky Reads helps children learn to identify&#xD;
      select fruits and vegetables is still needed. Questions also remain whether Husky Reads&#xD;
      increases the odds of a child tasting and/or liking select fruits and vegetables as well as&#xD;
      recognition of MyPlate and foods in different food groups. The proposed evaluation uses a&#xD;
      pre-test/post- test control group design with paired data at the child level to explore&#xD;
      whether children who participate in Husky Reads have increased odds of identifying MyPlate&#xD;
      and food group concepts , and correctly identifying,trying or liking select fruits and&#xD;
      vegetables.&#xD;
