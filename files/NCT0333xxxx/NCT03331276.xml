  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A goal of infant formula development is to mimic human milk (HM) both in nutrient composition&#xD;
      as well as physiologic outcomes. investigators have developed an infant formula for term&#xD;
      infants that more closely resembles the composition of human milk. The purpose of this study&#xD;
      is to demonstrate that this formulation meets nutritional requirements and supports age&#xD;
      appropriate growth of healthy term infants.&#xD;

      This study is a randomized, controlled, double-blind, study of healthy term formula fed (FF)&#xD;
      infants. FF infants will be randomized to receive either a experimental infant formula,&#xD;
      formulated for healthy term infants (BBN) or a commercially available infant formula for&#xD;
      healthy term infants (Brand). Infants will consume the formula for a total of 16-weeks;&#xD;
      infant growth, serum markers for inflammation and tolerance to the formulas will be assessed&#xD;
      throughout the study.&#xD;
