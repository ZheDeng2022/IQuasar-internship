  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following the emergence of avian influenza A/H7N9 influenza virus in humans in China in March&#xD;
      2013, the WHO Essential Regulatory Laboratories prepared candidate vaccine viruses and&#xD;
      reagents for further development and several manufacturers have developed various inactivated&#xD;
      influenza vaccines with and without adjuvant against A/H7N9 and tested these candidates in&#xD;
      trials in healthy adults. The overall aim of this study is to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      immunogenicity and dose sparing effects of H7N9 influenza antigen produced by Butantan&#xD;
      Institute in combination with 2 different adjuvants.&#xD;

             conditions to resolve. Screening laboratory values that are out of range, but are&#xD;
             considered to be due to an acute illness or process may be repeated once. Grade 1&#xD;
             laboratory values will be reviewed by a licensed study clinician and the clinician&#xD;
