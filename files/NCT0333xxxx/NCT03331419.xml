  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study is intended to identify sex differences in myalgic encephalomyelitis/&#xD;
      chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) during recovery from brief but high effort exercise tests.&#xD;
      It is expected that women with ME/CFS as compared to males with ME/CFS will show slower&#xD;
      recovery from exercise with respect to heart rate and blood pressure, physical functioning,&#xD;
      and symptom severity. Also females with ME/CFS as compared to males with ME/CFS will show&#xD;
      greater negative impacts on heart rate, blood pressure, physical functioning and symptom&#xD;
      severity after the two exercise tests. The findings will have implications for sex&#xD;
      differences in the pathophysiology of post-exertional malaise and activity/exercise&#xD;
      self-management recommendations, given the expected detrimental effects of the brief intense&#xD;
      exercise tests on patients with ME/CFS.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This supplement to the parent study, Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/ Chronic Fatigue Syndrome&#xD;
      (ME/CFS): Activity patterns and autonomic function, is intended to enhance the larger&#xD;
      home-based study with a face-to-face laboratory arm. Specifically, the investigators propose&#xD;
      a pilot study to assess biobehavioral sex differences in ME/CFS during recovery after a brief&#xD;
      high exertion exercise task, i.e., a six-minute walk test repeated on two consecutive days.&#xD;
      The investigators expect adverse symptomatic, functional, and autonomic effects following&#xD;
      this repeat exercise test. This &quot;post-exertional malaise (PEM)&quot; and its impact on global&#xD;
      outcomes is a unique feature of ME/CFS that is being studied in the parent observational&#xD;
      study conducted by participants entirely in their homes. In the proposed supplement, PEM and&#xD;
      its impacts will be captured in real time under controlled conditions in the research team's&#xD;
      laboratory. Of particular interest, autonomic effects of PEM on heart function and blood&#xD;
      pressure using non-invasive research grade monitors. The specific aims are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: After two high-effort six minute walk tests conducted on consecutive days,&#xD;
      female subjects with ME/CFS as compared to male ME/CFS subjects will show slower recovery&#xD;
      with respect to cardiovascular autonomic functioning, physical functioning, and symptom&#xD;
      resolution. Specific Aim 2: Female subjects with ME/CFS as compared to males with ME/CFS will&#xD;
      show greater adverse impact on autonomic and physical functioning and symptom severity after&#xD;
      the day 2 exercise test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To more accurately characterize exercise recovery abnormalities differentiated by sex, the&#xD;
      investigators propose to longitudinally monitor symptoms, activity levels, and autonomic&#xD;
      status during the week before (baseline) as compared to the week after (follow-up) the two&#xD;
      exercise tests. This pilot study will also provide potential cross-validation of the parent&#xD;
      project which hypothesizes specific relationships between autonomic function symptom severity&#xD;
      and activity limitations. A parallel analysis of sex differences will also be carried out on&#xD;
      the data collected in the parent project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pilot study will remain within the scope of the original aims of the parent study to&#xD;
      identify biobehavioral factors related to PEM, symptom-worsening activity patterns, and&#xD;
      non-improvement in ME/CFS. This supplement will expand the parent project's home-based data&#xD;
      collection to a controlled setting with direct observation and verification of exercise tests&#xD;
      carried out by participants in the principal investigator's laboratory.&#xD;

        local recruitment ads placed online in University announcements and local newspapers; and&#xD;
        (b) CFS subjects who have completed the parent study. Ads will emphasize that the study&#xD;
        will help to advance our understanding of the biology of CFS (e.g., autonomic functioning).&#xD;
