  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is believed that the body's immune system protects the body by attacking and killing tumor&#xD;
      cells. T-lymphocytes (T-cells) are part of the immune system and can attack when they&#xD;
      recognize special proteins on the surface of tumors. In most patients with advanced cancer,&#xD;
      T-cells are not stimulated enough to kill the tumor. In this research study, we will use a&#xD;
      patient's tumor to make a vaccine which we hope will stimulate T-cells to kill tumor cells&#xD;
      and leave normal cells alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High grade gliomas (HGGs) are very aggressive and difficult for the body's immune system to&#xD;
      attack. Before T-cells can become active against tumor cells, they require strong stimulation&#xD;
      by special &quot;stimulator&quot; cells in the body called Dendritic Cells (DCs) which are also part of&#xD;
      the immune system. DCs can recognize the cancer cells and then activate the T lymphocytes,&#xD;
      and create this strong stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research study is to learn whether anti-tumor T-cells and anti-tumor DC&#xD;
      vaccines can be given safely. Most importantly, this study is also to determine whether the&#xD;
      T-cells and DC vaccines can stimulate a person's immune system to fight off the tumor cells&#xD;
      in the brain.&#xD;

      It is believed that the body's immune system protects the body by attacking and killing tumor&#xD;
      cells. T-lymphocytes (T-cells) are part of the immune system and can attack when they&#xD;
      recognize special proteins on the surface of tumors. But in most patients with advanced&#xD;
      cancer, T-cells are not stimulated enough to kill the tumor. In this research study, we will&#xD;
      use your tumor to make a vaccine which we hope will stimulate your T-cells to kill tumor&#xD;
      cells and leave your normal cells alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High grade gliomas (HGGs) are very aggressive and difficult for the body's immune system to&#xD;
      attack. Before T-cells can become active against tumor cells, they require strong stimulation&#xD;
      by special &quot;stimulator&quot; cells in the body called Dendritic Cells (DCs) which are also part of&#xD;

      The purpose of this research study is to learn whether anti-tumor T-cells and anti-tumor DC&#xD;
      vaccines can be given safely. Most importantly, this study is also to determine whether the&#xD;
      T-cells and DC vaccines can stimulate your immune system to fight off the tumor cells in your&#xD;
      brain. When the vaccine for this study is made, dendritic cells will be loaded with genetic&#xD;
      material called RNA (ribonucleic acid) from your tumor to stimulate the dendritic cells. The&#xD;
      vaccine has two components given at different times after chemoradiation and throughout&#xD;
      chemotherapy cycles. The first part, the DC vaccine, involves RNA loaded dendritic cells that&#xD;
      are given under the skin at several time points in the study and the second part, xALT&#xD;
      vaccine, is a single infusion of tumor-specific T cells delivered through one of two&#xD;
      peripheral IV catheters that are placed prior to infusion. This vaccine is investigational&#xD;
      which means that it is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is being&#xD;
      tested in research studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hoped that by injecting the DC vaccine into your skin and infusing the T-cells into&#xD;
      your blood, your immune system will be activated against the tumor. Once it is activated&#xD;
      against the tumor, your immune system may recognize and attack the tumor cells in your brain&#xD;
      and not attack normal cells. Use of a vaccine that stimulates your immune system is called&#xD;
      immunotherapy.&#xD;
