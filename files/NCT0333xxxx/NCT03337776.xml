  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that there are about 1.4 million patients with colorectal cancer (CRC)&#xD;
      worldwide, with a rising trend in CRC incidence in many Asian Pacific countries1. In Hong&#xD;
      Kong, colorectal cancer ranks first in cancer incidence and second in cancer mortality based&#xD;
      on data from 20142.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent guidelines from USA, Europe and Asia Pacific region recommend CRC screening for&#xD;
      average-risk asymptomatic individuals starting at age 503-5. Modalities such as guaiac-based&#xD;
      fecal occult blood tests (gFOBT), fecal immunochemical tests (FIT), flexible sigmoidoscopy&#xD;
      (FS), and colonoscopy are among the acceptable options for CRC screening3-5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Department of Health of Hong Kong launched a Colorectal Cancer Screening Pilot Program in&#xD;
      late 2016. This is a subsidized program offering primary care consultation with FIT. For&#xD;
      those subjects with FIT positive, colonoscopy specialist consultation and colonoscopy will be&#xD;
      arranged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The local uptake rate of CRC screening was reported to be 24.5%8 , which is relatively low&#xD;
      when compared to other developed county9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, social media (SM) has become an increasingly popular source of health&#xD;
      information10. By providing an easily accessible and interactive channel of communication&#xD;
      between reviewers and information providers, it has potential values for affecting public&#xD;
      health. However, the effects of SM on uptake of CRC screening has not yet been studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WhatsApp Messenger, is the most popular social media messaging app worldwide. This randomized&#xD;
      controlled study will investigate the effect of WhatsApp vs telephone intervention on the&#xD;
      uptake of CRC screening.&#xD;
