  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: To assess 15 subjects with PD and 15 healthy controls, who exercise on a regular&#xD;
      basis, before, during and after 30 minutes of pedaling exercise intervention. The&#xD;
      investigators will assess subjects for alterations in motor cortex assessment, cognition and&#xD;
      mood as measured by EMG/EEG, motor assessment and several batteries of questionnaires.&#xD;
      Findings from this study will lay the foundation for long-term studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: The investigators anticipate to observe an altered involvement of motor cortex&#xD;
      during steady pedaling in individuals suffering from PD. In healthy control subjects it is&#xD;
      anticipated that changes in cognition will be observable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification: Hindered movement initiation and continuing locomotion is a common syndrome in&#xD;
      PD with profound impact on the patient's mobility and quality of life. So far, the underlying&#xD;
      pathophysiology is not completely understood. Since the observation that cortical activity&#xD;
      contributes to the muscle activity during locomotion-like tasks underpins the importance of&#xD;
      corticospinal function in humans, it is of importance to examine whether this cortical&#xD;
      involvement is altered and displays abnormalities in patients with PD. Thus, the approach of&#xD;
      corticomuscular coupling during a locomotion-like task would allow for better understanding&#xD;
      of the pathophysiology of PD, a prerequisite to develop therapies. Findings of this study&#xD;
      will lay the foundation for future long-term studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, by examining the oscillatory EEG patterns during the exercise intervention, the&#xD;
      investigator will be able to read out the dose response curve in real time, which will&#xD;
      provide information on the optimum intensity and duration of exercise. Findings will help to&#xD;
      design future studies and to develop efficient exercise therapy interventions for people with&#xD;
      PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People living with PD often suffer from cognitive decline, depression, and fatigue. By&#xD;
      assessing cognitive function before and after the exercise intervention, there will be laid a&#xD;
      foundation for future studies investigating the effect of exercise on cognition. The&#xD;
      collected pilot data will be relevant to learn more about the effects of exercise on mood and&#xD;
      fatigue as well as concomitant obstacles and facilitators during exercise interventions in&#xD;
      patients with PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to investigate if activity that arises in&#xD;
      the motor cortex and contributes to the muscle activity during moderate pedaling is altered&#xD;
      in patients with PD compared to healthy gender- and age-matched controls. Thus, to better&#xD;
      understand the role of the motor cortex and its contribution in simple automated repetitive&#xD;
      tasks in patients with PD there will be analysis of the coherence of the coupling between EEG&#xD;
      and EMG from active leg muscles during cycling on a stationary bicycle both in subjects with&#xD;
      PD and age and gender matched healthy controls.&#xD;
