      Prospective non-randomized, open, unicentric observational study to compare two different&#xD;
      treatments for Three-four parts fractures of proximal humerus (Neer's Classification) in&#xD;
      elderly patients (over 75 years old). Both technics are: Sling inmobilization and shoulder&#xD;
      arthroplasty.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The investigators propose an observational study that aims to assess:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primarily, the functional results of a cohort of 20 pacients presenting fractures of 3&#xD;
           and 4 parts of proximal humerus (according to (Neer's Classification) that will be&#xD;
           treated orthopedically (this is, non-surgically). This patients will be recruited in the&#xD;
           emergency room of our center, and after being diagnosed of their fracture, will be&#xD;
           treated with a sling for three weeks and subsequent rehabilitation treatment. Our&#xD;
           intention is to assess the function of the injured shoulder using functional scales&#xD;
           (ASES, DASH and Constant score, and VAS scale) at the time of three and twelve months&#xD;
           from the date of the trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondly the investigators want to compare the results obtained in this cohort with the&#xD;
           results of a historical cohort of patients operated in our center with the same type of&#xD;
           fracture. Both types of treatment (non-surgical and shoulder prosthesis) are valid for&#xD;
           this type of fracture, and endorsed by the scientific literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators consider this to be an observational study since it assigns a single cohort&#xD;
      of patients a single treatment (ie non-surgical treatment). The conservative treatment for&#xD;
      this fractures is part of routine medical care, and the object of this study is to evaluate&#xD;
      the effect of this intervention.&#xD;

    <measure>Constant Scale Evaluation at 3 Months and 12 Months From the Date of Trauma</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in numeric values for the Constant shoulder function scale applied to 20 patients with fractures of 3 and 4 parts of proximal humerus (according to Neer's Classification) evaluated at the time of 3 months and 12 months from the date of the trauma.&#xD;
The Constant scale, also known as the ConstantMurley score, is one of the most widely used instruments to evaluate the shoulder. It was originally published in 1987 by the European Society of Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (SECEC) as a method to compare function of the shoulder before and after a treatment. It is a system that combines the physical examination (65 points) with the subjective evaluation of the patient (35 points). The maximum score is 100 points, being from 90 to 100 excellent, from 80 to 89 good, from 70 to 79 average, and less than 70 poor.</description>

    <description>Changes in numeric values for the ASES shoulder function scale applied to 20 patients with fractures of 3 and 4 parts of proximal humerus (according to Neer's Classification) evaluated at the time of 3 months and 12 months from the date of the trauma.&#xD;
ASES evaluation comprises a subjective part completed by the patient and an objective part performed by doctor. The subjective includes questions about pain, symptoms of instability, and activities of daily living.&#xD;
The final score includes two subscales:&#xD;
Pain subscale 0-50 ASES points.&#xD;
Function/disability subscale 0-50 ASES points. Total score 0-100 ASES points, being 0 = worse pain and functional loss/disability</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>DASH Scale Evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in numeric values for the DASH scale applied to 20 patients with fractures of 3 and 4 parts of proximal humerus (according to Neer's Classification) evaluated at the time of 3 months and 12 months from the date of the trauma.&#xD;
DASH scale consists of 30 questions. In addition, there are two optional modules, each containing four questions, which are used to assess the symptoms and function of athletes, artists and other workers whose functional demands exceed those assessed by the DASH questionnaire.&#xD;
Calculating the final score is relatively complicated. To calculate the score it is necessary that at least 27 of the 30 questions have been answered. The final score is obtained by calculating the arithmetic mean of the answered questions, subtracting 1 and multiplying by 25. This calculation provides a score between 0 and 100, with the greater the disability the higher the score obtained, and considering variations with clinical significance those that exceed the 10 points.</description>

    <description>Changes in numeric values for the Changes in numeric values for the VAS scale applied to 20 patients with fractures of 3 and 4 parts of proximal humerus (according to Neer's Classification) evaluated at the time of 3 months and 12 months from the date of the trauma.&#xD;
VAS is defined as a one-dimensional scale for the subjective assessment of pain by the patient. It consists of a straight line (usually 10 centimeters -100 millimeters) in whose limits the most extreme degrees of pain intensity are located, considering a score of 0 points for the lowest degree or absence of pain (usually referred by the patient as &quot;no pain&quot;) and 100 points for the highest grade (often referred to as &quot;worst bearable&quot; or &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot;).&#xD;
The final score (from 0 to 100 points) is obtained by measuring the distance in millimeters between the lower end (score of 0 points) and the mark indicated by the patient along the line.</description>

        <title>Constant Scale Evaluation at 3 Months and 12 Months From the Date of Trauma</title>
        <description>Changes in numeric values for the Constant shoulder function scale applied to 20 patients with fractures of 3 and 4 parts of proximal humerus (according to Neer's Classification) evaluated at the time of 3 months and 12 months from the date of the trauma.&#xD;
The Constant scale, also known as the ConstantMurley score, is one of the most widely used instruments to evaluate the shoulder. It was originally published in 1987 by the European Society of Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (SECEC) as a method to compare function of the shoulder before and after a treatment. It is a system that combines the physical examination (65 points) with the subjective evaluation of the patient (35 points). The maximum score is 100 points, being from 90 to 100 excellent, from 80 to 89 good, from 70 to 79 average, and less than 70 poor.</description>

DASH scale consists of 30 questions. In addition, there are two optional modules, each containing four questions, which are used to assess the symptoms and function of athletes, artists and other workers whose functional demands exceed those assessed by the DASH questionnaire.&#xD;
Calculating the final score is relatively complicated. To calculate the score it is necessary that at least 27 of the 30 questions have been answered. The final score is obtained by calculating the arithmetic mean of the answered questions, subtracting 1 and multiplying by 25. This calculation provides a score between 0 and 100, with the greater the disability the higher the score obtained, and considering variations with clinical significance those that exceed the 10 points.</description>

VAS is defined as a one-dimensional scale for the subjective assessment of pain by the patient. It consists of a straight line (usually 10 centimeters -100 millimeters) in whose limits the most extreme degrees of pain intensity are located, considering a score of 0 points for the lowest degree or absence of pain (usually referred by the patient as &quot;no pain&quot;) and 100 points for the highest grade (often referred to as &quot;worst bearable&quot; or &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot;).&#xD;
The final score (from 0 to 100 points) is obtained by measuring the distance in millimeters between the lower end (score of 0 points) and the mark indicated by the patient along the line.</description>
