  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether Synergo® RITE + MMC treatment is efficacious as second-line&#xD;
      therapy for CIS NMIBC BCG-unresponsive patients with or without papillary NMIBC, through&#xD;
      examination of the complete response rate (CRR) and disease-free duration for complete&#xD;
      responders. The study will also explore progression-free survival time, bladder preservation&#xD;
      rate, and overall survival time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will address an unmet need to identify a treatment effective in both ablating the&#xD;
      disease and providing a prolonged disease-free period for patients. Ideally, the treatment&#xD;
      will delay progression to invasive disease, thus preserving the bladder.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with current CIS of the bladder, with or without coexisting papillary Ta/T1&#xD;
             NMIBC tumor(s), who experienced an occurrence or recurrence of CIS within 12 months of&#xD;
             completion of adequate BCG7 therapy. An adequate BCG regimen shall consist of at least&#xD;
             2 courses of BCG where the first course (induction) must have included at least 5 of 6&#xD;
             weekly treatments and the second course may have included a re-induction (at least 2&#xD;
             of 6 treatments) or maintenance, (at least 2 of 3 treatments) administered on a&#xD;
             schedule similar to the SWOG 8507 study regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. All clinical, intra-operative and pathological items for the AUA risk stratification&#xD;
             must be documented. This includes bladder mapping, according to the instructions&#xD;
             specified in the protocol. With regard to BCG and/or other NMIBC treatments&#xD;
             documentation must include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Date of initial treatment,&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Date of last treatment,&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. The number of courses administered and the number of treatments administered in&#xD;
                  each course.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with concomitant papillary tumor(s) must have undergone a repeat TUR 2-4&#xD;
             weeks prior to the first study treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. if the previous TUR was incomplete,&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. if there was no muscle in the specimen after the initial TUR (except in TaLG&#xD;
                  tumors),&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. in all T1,&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. in all HG tumors ≥ 3cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. CT-IVU or MRI-IVU or IVU/retrograde confirmation of absence of tumor(s) in the upper&#xD;
             tract, kidney and ureters performed within 6 months before the study treatment&#xD;
             initiation, in selected cases, as recommended in latest AUA guidelines published prior&#xD;
             to screening. If IVU/retrograde protocol is not available or contrast allergy/poor&#xD;
             renal function preclude such imaging, then non-contrast CT or MRI of the&#xD;
             abdomen/pelvis within the same timeframe will suffice.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Visual inspection to exclude urothelial carcinoma (UC) in the urethra during&#xD;
             cystoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Biopsy of the prostatic urethra, prior to enrollment, to exclude UC of the prostatic&#xD;
             urethra, in male patients with:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. tumor of trigone,&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. tumor of bladder neck, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. abnormal prostatic urethra&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. prior history of prostatic urethral involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. All patients must have urine cytology collected from either voided urine or bladder&#xD;
             wash within the screening period prior to enrollment. Patients with positive cytology&#xD;
             must also have selective cytology from the upper tract and prostatic urethral biopsies&#xD;
             collected within the same period. Patients with a localizing positive upper tract&#xD;
             cytology are excluded from the study until definitive treatment renders them free of&#xD;
             disease visually and/or radiographically and cytologically (nephroureterectomy, distal&#xD;
             ureterectomy or upper tract therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Age ≥ 18 yrs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. No evidence of urothelial cancer in either kidneys or ureters.&#xD;

&#xD;
               6. SGOT &lt; 1.5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;

             retain in their bladder, and this will be used to determine urine volume. A minimum&#xD;
             volume of 250 ml is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients with severe bladder outlet obstruction not adequately controlled with&#xD;

&#xD;
         16. Bladder diverticulum with diameter &gt; 1cm, as determined by CT or cystography&#xD;
