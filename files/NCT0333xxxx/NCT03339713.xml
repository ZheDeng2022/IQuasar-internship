  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the non-inferiority of the concomitant&#xD;
      administration of an adenovirus serotype 26- based vaccine encoding for the respiratory&#xD;
      syncytial virus pre-fusion F protein (Ad26.RSV.preF) and seasonal influenza vaccine versus&#xD;
      the administration of seasonal influenza vaccine alone in terms of humoral immune response&#xD;
      expressed by the geometric mean titers (GMTs) of hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody&#xD;
      titers against all four influenza vaccine strains 28 days after the administration of&#xD;
      influenza vaccine, and to assess the safety and tolerability of a single dose of 1*10^11&#xD;
      viral particles (vp) of Ad26.RSV.preF, administered intramuscularly to participants aged&#xD;
      greater than or equal to 60 years separately or concomitantly with seasonal influenza&#xD;
      vaccine.&#xD;

             unstable cardiac disease, Alzheimer's disease, or has any condition for which, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the investigator, participation would not be in the best interest of the&#xD;
             participant (for example, compromise well-being) or that could prevent, limit, or&#xD;
             confound the protocol-specified assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has history of malignancy within 5 years before screening (exceptions are&#xD;
             squamous and basal cell carcinomas of the skin and carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or&#xD;
             malignancy, which is considered cured with minimal risk of recurrence)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has had major surgery (per the investigator's judgment), within 4 weeks&#xD;
             before dosing, or will not have fully recovered from surgery, or has surgery planned&#xD;

    <limitations_and_caveats>Although qualification of the site was satisfactory for peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) processing,during the study PBMC processing resulted in much lower yield than expected, which have affected the quality of PBMC. While sample quality requirements on sample viability were met for most samples,viability was considered lower than commonly expected.An indication of possible suboptimal quality of PBMC samples were also be a low baseline responses observed in comparison to other studies.</limitations_and_caveats>
