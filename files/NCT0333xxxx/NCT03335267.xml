  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label study to assess the suitability of CPX-351 as first intensive therapy&#xD;
      in elderly (age ≥60 years) patients with AML. Patients may have received prior AML treatment&#xD;
      with non-intensive regimens, e.g. hypomethylating agents, low dose Ara C or lenolidomide, but&#xD;
      may not have received intensive AML treatment with anthracyclines and/or cytarabine prior to&#xD;
      enrollment on this trial. The outcome of elderly patients following intensive treatment with&#xD;
      CPX-351 will be measured by clinical endpoints for efficacy and safety and by&#xD;
      biological/functional response.&#xD;
