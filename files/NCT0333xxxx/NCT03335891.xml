  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objective: To investigate the effectiveness of core stabilization exercises combined with the&#xD;
      patient education program (AEP) and breathing exercises in patients with asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A randomized controlled study Setting: Chest diseases clinic of a university&#xD;
      hospital. Subjects: The study sample consists of 26-68 years old asthma patients who were&#xD;
      diagnosed at least 6 month prior to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: All subjects were included in the asthma education program (AEP) and both&#xD;
      groups were trained for diaphragmatic and pursed lip breathing exercises (2times/wk. 6-week&#xD;
      duration at clinic). The core stabilization program was applied twice a week for a duration&#xD;
      of 6 weeks in TG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Measures: Spirometry, maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP) and maximum expiratory pressure&#xD;
      (MEP), International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form (IPAQ), Hospital Anxiety and&#xD;
      Depression Scale(HADS), Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire(AQOL), Six-minute walking&#xD;
      test(6MWT), Prokin PK200, Italy were used to evaluate feasibility of interventions.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      All volunteers received an asthma education program (AEP) and trained for diaphragmatic and&#xD;
      pursed lip breathing exercises. Additionally, the TG participated in the core stabilization&#xD;
      exercises program combined with AEP and breathing exercises. Data were collected from all the&#xD;
      patients at baseline and post interventions (6 week) by the same physiotherapist who also&#xD;
      supervised the exercise sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects were included in the asthma education program (AEP). AEP was performed at least&#xD;
      once for approximately 20 minutes via face to face interviews. Education topics covered&#xD;
      description of asthma, physiological changes of lungs, risk factors, treatment methods,&#xD;
      relaxation positions to reduce dyspnea and usage of a specific inhaler. Breathing exercises&#xD;
      were comprised of instructing breathing control, diaphragmatic breathing and pursed lip&#xD;
      breathing exercises. Participants attended breathing exercises training for 2 days at the&#xD;
      clinic under the supervision of a physiotherapist and 3 days at home as a home-exercise&#xD;
      program. Total duration of breathing exercises lasted for 6 weeks. TG performed core&#xD;
      stabilization exercises combined with breathing control for 2 days/a week for the duration of&#xD;
      6 weeks under the supervision of a physiotherapist at the clinic. Basic knowledges on spine,&#xD;
      muscles of core stabilization and working principle of diaphragm and biofeedback unit (SPB)&#xD;
      (Chattanooga Stabilizer Pressure Biofeedback, USA) were explained before the training. The&#xD;
      SPB consists of an inflation pump and a cell like sphygmomanometer, which reflects body&#xD;
      spinal movement in terms of mmHg by changing pressure in air filled cells. The SPB was placed&#xD;
      under the lumbar 5th vertebra and patients attempted to maintain their core stability&#xD;
      performing neutral zones at the settled level of 40 mmHg pressure. Furthermore,&#xD;
      physiotherapist tried to improve thoracolumbar awareness by following changes from SPB and&#xD;
      volunteers assured a constant lumbar position during upper and lower extremity movements&#xD;
      combined with diaphragmatic movements. The 6 week exercise protocol emphasized core muscle&#xD;
      co-contraction in hook-lying position with a flat cushion between two knees to provide&#xD;
      integration between the pelvic floor muscles and diaphragm. Subsequently, exercises&#xD;
      progressed as diaphragmatic breathing, flexion of both shoulder with breathing control and&#xD;
      extending knees bilaterally with breathing control. Moreover, the hold time and the number of&#xD;
      repetitions were increased from 5 repeats x 1 set to 5 repeats x 4 sets and each session&#xD;
      lasted 20 minutes.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Six Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Dynamic balance alterations of the subjects were assessed by TechnoBody Prokin PK 200 (PK), Italy dynamic balance instrument. PK is a circular mobile balance assessment platform like conventional rocker board. PK transmits data from platform to the computer with a wireless transmitter and it can detect each single angular movement with a chip inside the platform. Additionally, PK has four different applicators (easy, medium, hard and rectangular) to place under the mobile platform. The bipedal position for 30 seconds with the easy applicator during the dynamic balance test was used. PK is connected to a computer; in this way each single movement is recorded by a computer in real time mode.</description>
