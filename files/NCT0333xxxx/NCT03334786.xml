  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The FLX-787-107 study will determine how well FLX-787-ODT works to reduce fasciculations in&#xD;
      patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). The study will measure how often&#xD;
      fasciculations occur, if tongue and muscle strength, speech, and swallowing are affected, and&#xD;
      monitor any side effects that might develop while taking the investigational product.&#xD;
      Participants will be assessed before and after taking a single dose of FLX-787-ODT.&#xD;
      Approximately 15 people will take part in this study at one center in the United States.&#xD;
      Participants will be in the study for a single clinic visit and receive a telephone call 7&#xD;
      days later to monitor for side effects.&#xD;
