  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Minimal invasive surgery has acquired increased importance and the number of procedures&#xD;
      performed is ever growing. Laparoscopic surgery has several distinct key benefits for&#xD;
      patients over open surgery and therefore it is considered as standard treatment for most&#xD;
      general surgery procedures. These benefits include faster recovery, shorter hospital stay,&#xD;
      reduced post-operative pain and improved cosmetic results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, laparoscopy has an increased burden to surgeons and many surgeons experience fatigue&#xD;
      and physical discomforts due to laparoscopy. Robotic systems have been developed to improve&#xD;
      the ergonomics (among other things), with good results. Many of the laparoscopy disadvantages&#xD;
      have been overcome by robotic assisted surgery, such as increased range of motion, correction&#xD;
      of the inverted instruments, and elimination of tremors.(4) Moreover, visualization of the&#xD;
      operation is improved by personal camera control and stabilization of the image.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The AutoLap system, a video analytic robotic camera holder, has been developed to hold the&#xD;
      camera in a stable manner. It enables the surgeon to control the camera and eliminates the&#xD;
      need for coordination and communication between surgeon and assistants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate the ergonomics of the surgeon and assistant during laparoscopy&#xD;
      with the aid of the AutoLap system and compare it to standard laparoscopy. Also, it will be&#xD;
      assessed whether the AutoLap can reduce physical and mental discomfort of both the surgeon&#xD;
      and the assistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective This multicenter randomized controlled trial aims to compare ergonomics of the OR&#xD;
      nurse and the surgeon during standard laparoscopic procedures with laparoscopic procedures&#xD;
      aided by a robotic camera holder, the AutoLap system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design Prospective, interventional, open, multicenter randomized controlled trial. The&#xD;
      study will be conducted in Wilhemina Hospital Assen and in Meander Medical Center Amersfoort.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        1. Aged ≥ 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Fit for standard laparoscopic general surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria&#xD;

&#xD;
        2. Obesity (BMI &gt;35 Kg/m2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention AutoLap group: In the AutoLap group, the camera will be held by a robotic arm.&#xD;
      Posture of the surgeon and the assistant will be recorded during standardized predefined&#xD;
      steps of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group: In the control group the camera will be held and maneuvered by a human&#xD;
      assistant. The procedures will be performed according to the hospital and OR routine&#xD;
      procedure. The surgical team will consist of 2 assistants and a surgeon. One of the&#xD;
      assistants (OR-nurse, intern or resident) will hold the laparoscope and maneuver it. Posture&#xD;
      of the surgeon and the assistant that maneuvers the laparoscope will be recorded during&#xD;
      standardized predefined steps of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - RULA score, measured during predefined steps of the procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary parameters/endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Questionnaires: Subjective Mental Effort Questionnaire (SMEQ), Local Experienced Discomfort&#xD;
      (LED) scale (before and after the operation), NASA Task Load Index (NASA TLX).&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is our hypothesis that the ergonomics of the surgeon and his/her assistant will be&#xD;
      improved with the aid of the AutoLap than without the aid of a robotic camera holder.&#xD;
      Maintaining the same posture for a long period of time can lead to discomfort and fatigue of&#xD;
      the surgeon and his/her assistant. Also, the space at the OR table is limited. Therefore,&#xD;
      their body postures are sometimes awkward, unnatural and out of neutral position. With the&#xD;
      aid of a robotic camera holder, we expect to minify this problem and improve ergonomics&#xD;
      during laparoscopic operations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Autolap system is CE mark approved and is used frequently during laparoscopic operations.&#xD;
      No patient characteristics and data will be recorded. The ethics committee MEC-U in&#xD;
      Nieuwegein assessed this study and concluded that it does not fall under the scope of the&#xD;
      WMO. Therefore this is non-WMO research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The system shall be used in accordance with its cleared indication according to the clinical&#xD;
      plan by clinical staff that has appropriate qualifications and training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Predefined steps of the procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The defined steps for a hiatal hernia repair / fundoplication are as follows:&#xD;

&#xD;
      The defined steps for a splenectomy are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Opening of lesser peritoneal sac&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Division of gastrosplenic ligament&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Division of splenocolic ligament&#xD;
&#xD;

        -  Dissection of the anterior wall of the rectum&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dissection of Waldeyer's fascia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Division of the distal rectum&#xD;
&#xD;
      Position and angles of the posture will be measured with MATLAB software. The posture of the&#xD;
      surgeon and assistant will be photographed during the operation in two directions; from the&#xD;
      side and from behind. These photographs will be used to calculate the RULA score. The RULA&#xD;
      score is only measured during laparoscopic parts of the operation; if a part of the operation&#xD;
      is performed open (not laparoscopically) RULA score will NOT be measured during the open&#xD;
      part. No patient data or measurements will be acquired during this study. The positioning of&#xD;
      the surgeon and operating assistant, operating table and OR monitors will be standardized for&#xD;
      each type of procedure. Also, the placement of the monitors will be taken into account in&#xD;
      such a way that a good ergonomic posture of the surgeon and assistant is ensured.&#xD;
