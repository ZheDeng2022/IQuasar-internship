      The objectives of this study would be to determine the most effective management for&#xD;
      pediatric patients with chronic rhinosinusitis and asthma who fail medical management. The&#xD;
      Sinus and Nasal Quality of Life Survey (SN-5), a validated tool, will be used to track&#xD;
      symptoms of pediatric chronic rhinosinusitis. A decrease in at least 0.5 is felt to represent&#xD;
      an improvement in symptom control. In this study, the SN-5 at one year post intervention will&#xD;
      be the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints include complications, revision surgery, and&#xD;
      post operative endoscopy scores.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Indications for surgery for pediatric chronic rhinosinusitis currently lacks scientific&#xD;
      consensus. In general, children who fail medical management are candidates for surgery.&#xD;
      Currently, pre-operative evaluation with a CT scan of the sinuses is the gold standard prior&#xD;
      to sinus surgery. However, the role of the adenoids and adenoiditis in pediatric chronic&#xD;
      sinusitis is incompletely understood. Adenoids may contribute to sinusitis both as a&#xD;
      bacterial reservoir and obstruct nasal secretion drainage, owing to their larger relative&#xD;
      size in children. Adenoidectomy alone has been found to improve symptoms in 75% of children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been found that 50% of children continued to be symptomatic after adenoidectomy, and&#xD;
      went on to require endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS). In addition, of the group that failed, 58%&#xD;
      had asthma. Overall, asthma and age have been the only known risk factors for failure of&#xD;
      adenoidectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objectives The objectives of this study would be to determine the most effective&#xD;
      management for pediatric patients with chronic rhinosinusitis and asthma who fail medical&#xD;
      management. Outcomes will be evaluated using the SN-5, a validated tool used to track&#xD;
      symptoms of pediatric chronic rhinosinusitis. A decrease in at least 0.5 is felt to represent&#xD;
      an improvement in symptom control. In this study, the SN-5 at one year post intervention will&#xD;
      be the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints include complications, revision surgery, and&#xD;
      post operative endoscopy scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is the SN-5 score one year post surgery. A change of 0.5-1.0 is&#xD;
      considered a mild improvement, while a change of at least 1.0 is considered a moderate&#xD;
      improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixty patients are required to have an 80% chance of detecting, as significant at the 5%&#xD;
      level, an increase in the primary outcome measure from 47% in the control group to 80% in the&#xD;
      experimental group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Univariate statistical analysis using chi-square in analysis of binary outcomes. In addition&#xD;
      paired t test of preoperative and postoperative SN-5 scores will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis and Interpretation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of SN-5, and comparison of Lund-McKay(CT) scores along with post operative endoscopy&#xD;
      Kennedy scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient's will initially be seen as a referral to the otolaryngology clinic for symptoms&#xD;
      including chronic rhinosinusitis. If they meet inclusion criteria, they will be offered&#xD;
      enrollment into the study and consent will be obtained. Their symptoms will be followed at&#xD;
      each visit with the SN-5, a validated symptom-scoring tool to evaluate pediatric chronic&#xD;
      rhinosinusitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient does not improve with medical therapy alone after review of the SN-5 and in&#xD;
      discussion with caregivers, he or she will be offered entry into the study, with consent, CT&#xD;
      scan of the sinuses, and will be randomized to two different treatment arms. The first is&#xD;
      adenoidectomy. The patient will then be followed at defined intervals with evaluation of&#xD;
      symptoms by SN-5. Should symptoms worsen or not improve, they will then be offered endoscopic&#xD;
      sinus surgery, with findings from the CT scan of the sinuses to guide operative intervention.&#xD;
      Adenoidectomy followed by endoscopic sinus surgery is the current standard of care and serves&#xD;
      as the control arm. In the other experimental or study arm, the patient will undergo&#xD;
      adenoidectomy with endoscopic sinus surgery at the same time. Radioallergosorbent test blood&#xD;
      testing for allergies would be performed at the time of surgery in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients who initially improve with medical therapy, but relapse at a later time, they&#xD;
      may either undergo consent and randomization if they relapse within a year or a repeat course&#xD;
      of medical therapy if it has been one year since previous medical therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopic sinus surgery, in both arms would be tailored to abnormal findings in the CT scan,&#xD;
      as is the standard of care. Radiologists typically examine sinonasal disease of the sinuses,&#xD;
      and they would also be requested to comment on the patency of the osteo-meatal unit, as this&#xD;
      is a component of the Lund-McKay score. The Lund-McKay score is an objective radiologic grade&#xD;
      of the severity of sinusitis. If there is sinus thickening, or narrowing of the osteomeatal&#xD;
      unit, endoscopic sinus surgery would be tailored to this using either balloon sinus opening&#xD;
      or traditional antrostomy. Patient undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery will likely have at&#xD;
      least a maxillary antrostomy and anterior ethmoidectomy performed, with frontal sinusotomy,&#xD;
      posterior ethmoidectomy, and sphenoidotomy performed depending on CT or endoscopy findings.&#xD;
