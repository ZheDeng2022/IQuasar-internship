      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers are testing version of a system known as a magnetic resonance imagining (MRI)&#xD;
      scanner that uses strong magnetic fields, radio waves and the like to create images of the&#xD;
      organs in the body. It uses lower energy levels than other MRI scanners. This may help scan&#xD;
      people with metal devices in their body, or in invasive heart procedures using metal tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test a new MRI scanner and software changes to create better pictures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with disease and healthy volunteers, ages 18 and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have both the new MRI and a conventional MRI or only the new one. If 2 are&#xD;
      done, they must be within 60 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both MRI versions, participants lie on a table that slides into a large tube. During&#xD;
      scans, they will hold their breath for up to 20 seconds at a time. Heart activity will be&#xD;
      measured by wires connected to pads on the skin. A flexible belt may be used to monitor their&#xD;
      breathing. They will be in the scanner up to 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants can agree to have a dye called gadolinium injected into their arm during the&#xD;
      scan. This brightens the pictures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants can agree to take a drug called a vasodilator. This helps detect areas of the&#xD;
      heart with abnormal blood supply. Scans of the heart are taken before, during, and after they&#xD;
      get the medicine. The drug may cause temporary chest pain or shortness of breath. They may&#xD;
      get other drugs to relieve these symptoms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) provides accurate and reproducible measures of&#xD;
      cardiac chamber volumes, cardiac function, blood flow, myocardial scar, myocardial&#xD;
      extracellular volume as a measure of collagen content, myocardial iron content, and others,&#xD;
      all without exposure to ionizing radiation. The prevailing wisdom is that CMR using high&#xD;
      specific absorption rate (SAR) scanning modes produces images with higher signal-to-noise&#xD;
      ratio (SNR). We have proposed a method of CMR, requiring custom scanner hardware, that can be&#xD;
      performed with low SAR but that nevertheless preserves SNR because of more efficient use of&#xD;
      NMR signal. CMR using low SAR is attractive because it may reduce heating of metallic&#xD;
      structures. This may allow safe CMR in patients with metallic implants, and it may allow MRI&#xD;
      catheterization using metallic guidewires and catheter devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this non-significant risk (NSR) medical device study is to test initial technical&#xD;
      feasibility of low SAR CMR in healthy volunteers by technical optimization of scanner&#xD;
      protocols, to test comparative accuracy of standard CMR measurements in healthy volunteers&#xD;
      using low SAR CMR versus conventional CMR, and to test comparative accuracy of standard CMR&#xD;
      measurements in adult patients with known stable heart disease using low SAR CMR versus&#xD;
      conventional CMR. A secondary goal is to assess the potential of this new low SAR CMR system&#xD;
      to perform non cardiovascular radiological diagnostic imaging by testing comparative&#xD;
      diagnostic accuracy of standard MR measurements in adult patients with known non&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease using the low SAR CMR system vs conventional MR exam.&#xD;
