  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this trial is to assess the effects of whole egg consumption (12 per week),&#xD;
      compared to energy-matched typical breakfast control foods, on insulin sensitivity and other&#xD;
      markers of metabolic health, including fasting lipoprotein lipid levels and resting blood&#xD;
      pressure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, crossover study that includes two screening visits and two 4-week test&#xD;
      periods separated by a 4-week washout. Subjects will consume two eggs/day (12 eggs/week&#xD;
      consumed over 6 days per week, provided as breakfast foods such as burrito-type roll-up, egg&#xD;
      sandwich and omelet) or non-egg based control foods (provided as breakfast foods such as&#xD;
      English muffins, bagels, ready-to-eat cereal, and flavored muffins). The background diet will&#xD;
      be a habitual diet. The nutritional profiles of the egg and control breakfast foods will be&#xD;
      designed such that the energy from eggs will be substituted for a mixture of carbohydrate,&#xD;
      protein and fat in the control foods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study foods will be dispensed with instructions to consume the assigned breakfast food&#xD;
      starting on day 1. Subjects will be instructed to consume the breakfast foods in their&#xD;
      entirety each day, for the duration of the 28 day test period, and to record daily study food&#xD;
      intake. Subjects will receive diet instruction on the incorporation of food substitutions&#xD;
      during the test period to maintain habitual energy intake. Compliance will be assessed using&#xD;
      the Daily Log intake and number of foods consumed based on returned foods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) will be completed at baseline and the end of&#xD;
      each treatment period for evaluation of insulin sensitivity. Blood will be collected for a&#xD;
      fasting lipid profile (at all visits), glucose and insulin, high-sensitivity C-reactive&#xD;
      protein (hs-CRP), vertical auto profile (VAP) for cholesterol carried by lipoprotein&#xD;
      fractions (at baseline and end of each treatment period), with additional blood samples&#xD;
      collected for storage and archived for possible future analysis of non-genetic indicators of&#xD;
      metabolism. Assessments of vital signs and body weight, review of concomitant&#xD;
      medication/supplement use and inclusion and exclusion criteria for relevant changes, and&#xD;
      evaluation of adverse effects will be performed throughout the study.&#xD;
