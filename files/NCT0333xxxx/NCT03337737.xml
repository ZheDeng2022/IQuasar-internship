      The study will be a double blind, placebo controlled cross over design with equal treatment&#xD;
      and washout periods. Participants will sign an informed consent document prior to data&#xD;
      collection and will provide descriptive information about their physical activity by filling&#xD;
      out the Leisure and Physical Activity Survey. The participants will be 12 healthy, active&#xD;
      college aged males. The participant will have height and weight determined via a triple beam&#xD;
      balance with stadiometer, and their body fat% determine via a Bod Pod Gold Standard system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After wards the participants will supplement with either Placebo or Extreme Endurance (random&#xD;
      assignment for order) for ten days. The first 4 days will the participants will ingest four&#xD;
      tablets in the morning and evening (8 tablets total) followed by 6 days of three tablets in&#xD;
      the morning and evening (6 tablets total). Following the supplementation period the&#xD;
      participant will report to the human performance lab where they will be fitted with a mask to&#xD;
      collect expired gases and will perform a 25 watt ramp protocol on an electronically braked&#xD;
      cycle ergometer. During this test the participant will have a short warm up period, and then&#xD;
      a computer will automatically adjust the workload on the bike such that a slope of 25&#xD;
      watts/min is achieved. The test will conclude when the subject reaches volitional exhaustion.&#xD;
      Expired gases will be assessed with a COSMED QUARK CPET system. Prior to, and every two&#xD;
      minutes during the exercise lactate will be assessed via dermal puncture and a handheld&#xD;
      monitor. Ten minutes after the cessation of exercise, a venipuncture will be performed in the&#xD;
      antecubetal space and blood will be collected into a serum separator tube. This blood will be&#xD;
      spun down in a clinical centrifuge and the serum drawn off and ammonia determined via&#xD;
      enzymatic reaction. The remaining serum will be aliquoted and stored at -80 degrees Celsius&#xD;
      for later analysis (muscle damage, oxidative stress, inflammation). Participants will then&#xD;
      have a ten day rest period after which they will begin the 10 day supplementation period and&#xD;
      exercise trial with the opposite supplement.&#xD;

      Background and Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extreme Endurance has been studied in Europe and the data from these studies suggested that&#xD;
      the supplement may reduce acidity and increase exercise performance. The purpose of the&#xD;
      present investigation is to assess the total effects of Extreme Endurance during exercise.&#xD;
      The investigation will assess the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Performance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Performance will be measured as the peak wattage achieved at the lactate, and ventilator&#xD;
      thresholds as well as the peak wattage attained during a 25 watt ramp protocol on a&#xD;
      electronically braked cycle ergometer. During this test expired gases will be assessed breath&#xD;
      by breath, and lactate will be measured every 2 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Buffering Capacity:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the human body decreased inter-muscular pH can be quantified through changes in the amount&#xD;
      of expired CO2 and increases in serum ammonia (highly correlated with changes in pH&#xD;
      associated with high intensity exercise) and lactate measured in whole blood during the&#xD;
      exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle Damage:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post exercise stress and damage to muscle tissue can be quantified by examining the blood for&#xD;
      substances normally contained in the muscle tissue only. For this study both creatine kinase&#xD;
      and lactate dehydrogenase will be assessed, both have been used as markers of muscle damage&#xD;
      in a plethora of scientific publications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxidative Stress:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During exercise free radicals are generated, which a supplement such as Extreme Endurance can&#xD;
      potentially reduce. For this study 8OHdG will be measured, this is a marker of oxidative&#xD;
      damage to DNA caused by free radicals produced during exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inflammation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise produces a well documented inflammatory response. To examine the effects of Extreme&#xD;
      Endurance on inflammation a custom multiplex assay will be run that will measure IL-2, IL-6,&#xD;
      TNF alpha and C-reactive protein. These are all common markers for inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Does Extreme Endurance improve performance and increase power output during a graded&#xD;
           cycling protocol compared to placebo?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Does Extreme Endurance improve buffering capacity during a graded cycling protocol&#xD;
           compared to placebo?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Does Extreme Endurance reduce muscle damage caused by a graded cycling protocol compared&#xD;
           to placebo?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Does Extreme Endurance reduce oxidative stress caused by a graded cycling protocol&#xD;
           compared to placebo?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Does Extreme Endurance reduce inflammation caused by a graded cycling protocol compared&#xD;
           to placebo?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a double blind, placebo controlled cross over design with equal treatment&#xD;
      and washout periods. Participants will sign an informed consent document prior to data&#xD;
      collection and will provide descriptive information about physical activity history by&#xD;
      filling out the Leisure and Physical Activity Survey. The participants will be 16 healthy,&#xD;
      active college aged males. The participants will have height and weight determined via a&#xD;
      triple beam balance with stadiometer, and body fat% determine via a Bod Pod Gold Standard&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After wards the participants will supplement with either Placebo or Extreme Endurance (random&#xD;
      assignment for order) for ten days. The first 4 days will the participants will ingest four&#xD;
      tablets in the morning and evening (8 tablets total) followed by 6 days of three tablets in&#xD;
      the morning and evening (6 tablets total). Following the supplementation period the&#xD;
      participants will report to the human performance lab where a mask will be fitted to collect&#xD;
      expired gases and will perform a 25 watt ramp protocol on an electronically braked cycle&#xD;
      ergometer. During this test the participant will have a short warm up period, and then a&#xD;
      computer will automatically adjust the workload on the bike such that a slope of 25 watts/min&#xD;
      is achieved. The test will conclude when the participant reaches volitional exhaustion.&#xD;
      Expired gases will be assessed with a COSMED QUARK CPET system. Prior to, and every two&#xD;
      minutes during the exercise lactate will be assessed via dermal puncture and a handheld&#xD;
      monitor. Ten minutes after the cessation of exercise, a venipuncture will be performed in the&#xD;
      antecubetal space and blood will be collected into a serum separator tube. This blood will be&#xD;
      spun down in a clinical centrifuge and the serum drawn off and ammonia determined via&#xD;
      enzymatic reaction. The remaining serum will be aliquoted and stored at -80 degrees Celsius&#xD;
      for later analysis (muscle damage, oxidative stress, inflammation). Participants will then&#xD;
      have a ten day rest period after which they will begin the 10 day supplementation period and&#xD;
      exercise trial with the opposite supplement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunoassays&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the conclusion of data collection, serum aliquots will be thawed and analyzed via&#xD;
      colormetric or chemiluminescent immunoassays.&#xD;
