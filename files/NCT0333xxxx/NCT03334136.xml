  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study evaluates the effect of oral vitamin D supplementation on the severity of psoriasis&#xD;
      measured by Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) in adults with lower vitamin D levels. Half&#xD;
      of the participants will receive vitamin D, while the other half receive placebo.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies have indicated an association between lower levels of vitamin D and increased risk of&#xD;
      psoriasis. This study investigate if vitamin D supplementation can reduce the severity of the&#xD;
      skin disease as measured by Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI), as well as positively&#xD;
      influence the cardiometabolic profile and skin microbiota of persons with psoriasis through a&#xD;
      winter season.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consenting participants will be randomized to high dose vitamin D (20.000 IU/week) versus&#xD;
      placebo for four months. The participants will be recruited based on their 25-hydroxyvitamin&#xD;
      D (25(OH)D)-measurements in the 7th survey in the Tromsø study where 21.083 subjects&#xD;
      attended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to assure sufficient study participation we will (in season 2, winter 2018/19)&#xD;
      include 20-40 persons from the general population in Tromsø aged 20-79, who did not partake&#xD;
      in Tromsø 7, through advertisement and contact with patient organizations.&#xD;
