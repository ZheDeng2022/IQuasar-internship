  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An uncontrolled, non-randomized, open-plan, multi-centre study of treatment and therapeutic&#xD;
      education in endocrinology-diabetes-Nutrition that seeks to assess the interest of an adapted&#xD;
      physical activity educator for the implementation In place of physical activities in the&#xD;
      management and prevention of overweight and obesity. The proposed study seeks to promote the&#xD;
      physical activity (PA) to patients and employees, including the encouragement of physical&#xD;
      activity in a guided and personalized way, through workshops on working time, and follow-up&#xD;
      of the evolution of the PA through a Adapted questionnaire.&#xD;

      The evaluation will be proposed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  in the Department of Endocrinology, Metabolic diseases and Nutrition of the Nantes&#xD;
           University Hospital to all patients participating in &quot;overweight education groups&quot; in&#xD;
           complete hospitalization or in day hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to the employees of the group Fleury-Michon volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During a recruitment period of 6 months required for the recruitment of 100 patients and&#xD;
           80 employees;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For a total duration of the research for each 1 year participant. Patients and employees&#xD;
           will be systematically informed of the project and their consent will be collected by&#xD;
           oral and plotted in the medical file and in the employee file, kept by the adapted&#xD;
           physical activity educator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the hospital phase, patients will be asked to complete questionnaires regarding their&#xD;
      physical activity, diet and quality of life prior to hospital care. For an evaluation of the&#xD;
      chronological evolution of their physical activity, they will be invited to complete the&#xD;
      global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ 2.0), every 2 months, from their home, via the&#xD;
      Internet from a secure link (ECRF clinsight) for the duration of the Research is one year. At&#xD;
      6 months during a telephone contact and at 12 months, during a consultation, the food and&#xD;
      quality of life questionnaires will also have to be informed. The evolution of weight, body&#xD;
      mass index (BMI) and metabolic biological factors (fasting blood glucose and lipid balance)&#xD;
      will also be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the enterprise phase, employees will benefit from a life-health awareness program,&#xD;
      accompanied by an APA educator, they are offered the opportunity to participate in physical&#xD;
      activity workshops on a regular basis (12 workshops minimum over 6 months), adapted to their&#xD;
      abilities and personalized. They will be invited to fill, from their home or on the website&#xD;
      Fleury Michon, via the Internet from a secure link (ECRF clinsight) the same type of&#xD;
      questionnaire&#xD;
