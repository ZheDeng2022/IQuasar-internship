  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether AZD1775 has any effect on the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of three compounds (caffeine, omeprazole, and midazolam) that are&#xD;
      probes for common drug-metabolizing enzymes (caffeine-CYP1A2, omeprazole-CYP2C19,&#xD;
      midazolam-CYP3A). The study also seeks to determine the effect of AZD1775 on the QTc&#xD;
      interval, which is a common measure of cardiac (heart) function.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, 2-part study (Part A and Part B) in patients with advanced solid tumours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A: Part A of this study is an open-label, non-randomised, 2-period design. The treatment&#xD;
      starts with the administration of a cocktail of 3 medications:&#xD;
&#xD;
      caffeine, omeprazole and midazolam (Day -8), followed by pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling for 24&#xD;
      hours (Period 1) and a washout period of at least 7, but no more than 14 days. In Period 2,&#xD;
      AZD1775 will be administered twice daily (bid) until steady state for 2.5 days (total of 5&#xD;
      doses) and the final dose will be administered in combination with the cocktail in the&#xD;
      morning of Day 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B: Part B is an open-label, non-randomised study in the same patients who participated&#xD;
      in Part A. On Day -1, baseline dECG assessments will be performed at clock times matched to&#xD;
      planned/scheduled dECG assessment times on Days 1 and 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting on Day 1, each patient will receive AZD1775 (225 mg) bid for 2.5 days and will&#xD;
      undergo dECG and PK assessments pre-dose and for 12 hours post AZD1775 dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 3, patients will receive their final AZD1775 dose and undergo dECG and PK assessments&#xD;
      pre-dose and for 12 hours post-dose. On completion of Part B (ie, collection of the 24-hour&#xD;
      PK sample/dECG and safety assessments on Day 4) patients will enter a 4-day washout period&#xD;
      relative to the last dose of AZD1775. Within 3 days after the washout period, patients will&#xD;
      be required to attend an end of treatment (EoT) visit. Patients will be evaluated for their&#xD;
      eligibility and interest to enrol into the open-label continued access (CA) study&#xD;
      (D6014C00007).&#xD;
