      Aim of the study: To assess the efficacy of MonaLisa Touch procedure for the management of&#xD;
      genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) in a randomized double-blind placebo controlled&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

      Study design: Randomly assigning the intervention can eliminate the influence of unknown or&#xD;
      immeasurable confounding variables that may otherwise lead to biased and incorrect estimate&#xD;
      of treatment effect. Also, randomization eliminates confounding by baseline variables and&#xD;
      blinding eliminates confounding by co-interventions, thus eliminating the possibility that&#xD;
      the observed effects of intervention are due to differential use of other treatments. The&#xD;
      best comparison is placebo control that allows participants, investigators and study staff to&#xD;
      be blinded. The advantage of trial over an observational study is the ability to demonstrate&#xD;
      causality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Genitourinary syndrome of Menopause is a condition of postmenopausal women due to&#xD;
      estrogen deprivation which results in progressive worsening of the vaginal and vulvar anatomy&#xD;
      with symptoms of vulvar itching or pain during intercourse, vaginal dryness, urinary urgency&#xD;
      and frequency and frequent bladder infections. It could ultimately lead to vaginal bleeding,&#xD;
      petechial hemorrhages, vaginal narrowing or stenosis and hypertonicity of the pelvic muscles&#xD;
      due to anticipation of coital pain. The hypertonicity by itself can cause pelvic pressure or&#xD;
      pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, GSM is a chronic progressive disease state that if left untreated could have dire&#xD;
      vaginal and urogynecological consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MonaLisa Touch is a fractional CO2 laser that has been specially designed with the DEKA pulse&#xD;
      to stimulate vaginal tissue. It is delivered in a very precise manner and results in the&#xD;
      synthesis of collagen and stratification of the vaginal epithelium with improvement of the&#xD;
      vaginal pH and moisturization of the vaginal tissue due to increased blood flow and turgidity&#xD;
      of the ground substance from the synthesis of the proteoglycans, hyaluronic acid and&#xD;
      collagen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial trials on MonaLisa Touch have shown promising results with significant improvement in&#xD;
      vaginal exams and patient satisfaction scores.&#xD;
