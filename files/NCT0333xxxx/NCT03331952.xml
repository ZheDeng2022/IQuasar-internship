  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) remains a leading cause of childhood mortality&#xD;
      and morbidity. Between 2007 and 2012, Angkor Hospital for Children (AHC), Siem Reap, Cambodia&#xD;
      documented that S. pneumoniae was responsible for around 10% of bloodstream infections in&#xD;
      hospitalised children, with a case fatality rate of 15.6%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV), covering between 7 and 13 of the &gt;90&#xD;
      pneumococcal serotypes, has resulted in significant declines in invasive pneumococcal disease&#xD;
      (IPD) incidence in countries where they are included in routine childhood immunisation&#xD;
      schedules. Paediatric radiologic pneumonia incidence is also reduced by PCV, but the impact&#xD;
      on clinical pneumonia is minimal. The vaccines have had an effect on reducing the burden of&#xD;
      drug resistant IPD, although this may not be sustained. Given the large number of serotypes&#xD;
      not included in the current PCV formulations, it is not surprising that initial declines in&#xD;
      overall IPD incidence have been eroded by, for the time being, small increases in IPD due to&#xD;
      non-vaccine serotypes. To date most data on this serotype replacement disease has come from&#xD;
      high-income countries. It less clear how much serotype replacement will occur in low and&#xD;
      middle income countries, where pre-PCV disease incidence is generally higher and other&#xD;
      factors, such as unregulated antimicrobial consumption, may play a role in encouraging&#xD;
      non-vaccine serotype infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nasopharyngeal colonisation by S. pneumoniae is common in childhood and is an essential&#xD;
      prerequisite for invasive disease. Surveillance of pneumococcal colonisation can provide&#xD;
      important data regarding serotype replacement and disease-associated serotypes, and may also&#xD;
      allow prediction of likely IPD incidence changes post-vaccine introduction. A recent study of&#xD;
      pneumococcal colonisation in children attending the AHC out-patients has documented an&#xD;
      overall colonisation prevalence of approximately 65%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In January 2015, Cambodia will introduce the 13-valent PCV (PCV13; serotypes covered 1, 3, 4,&#xD;
      5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, 19A, 23F). The vaccine will be rolled out nationally with a&#xD;
      3+0 dosing schedule (6, 10 and 14 weeks) and no catch up campaign. There is no robust&#xD;
      national surveillance system in place to monitor the effects of PCV13 introduction.&#xD;

    <description>Prospective study of children with invasive pneumococcal disease / probable bacterial meningitis (PCV-D)&#xD;
Clinical procedures&#xD;
At study enrolment:&#xD;
Admission clinical findings / laboratory results will be recorded.&#xD;
A questionnaire will be administered to the parent / guardian or caretaker to assess the child's immunisation status, household structure, environmental exposures, and recent antimicrobial use.&#xD;
Radiology procedures As part of routine clinical management at AHC, a digital chest radiograph (CXR) may be performed as part of a child's diagnostic work up. CXRs will be read and interpreted primarily by the AHC radiologists. All CXR will subsequently be re-read by two study clinicians and interpreted according to the WHO paediatric radiologic pneumonia criteria.&#xD;
Laboratory procedures&#xD;
• Residual routine clinical specimens further analysed as part of the study protocol:&#xD;
Blood and cerebrospinal fluid culture specimens.&#xD;
EDTA / serum specimens.&#xD;
Urine.</description>
