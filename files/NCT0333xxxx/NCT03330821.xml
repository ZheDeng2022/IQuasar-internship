      This phase Ib/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of pevonedistat and to see how&#xD;
      well it works in combination with cytarabine and idarubicin in treating patients with acute&#xD;
      myeloid leukemia. Pevonedistat may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the&#xD;
      enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cytarabine and&#xD;
      idarubicin, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the&#xD;
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Given&#xD;
      pevonedistat, cytarabine, and idarubicin may work better in treating patients with acute&#xD;
      myeloid leukemia.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of&#xD;
      pevonedistat in combination with cytarabine and idarubicin in newly diagnosed high-risk acute&#xD;
      myeloid leukemia. (Phase Ib) II. To determine the composite complete response rate (complete&#xD;
      remission [CR] or complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery [CRi]) of&#xD;
      pevonedistat in combination with cytarabine and idarubicin in newly diagnosed high-risk acute&#xD;
      myeloid leukemia. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate plasma pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of pevonedistat when used in combination&#xD;
      with cytarabine and idarubicin in the phase Ib part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the relapse free (RFS), overall survival (OS), safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      pevonedistat in combination with cytarabine and idarubicin in the phase II part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the pharmacodynamics (PD) effects of pevonedistat in combination with&#xD;
      cytarabine and idarubicin in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) blasts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate potential predictive biomarkers of response to pevonedistat in combination&#xD;
      with cytarabine and idarubicin in AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the CR without minimal residual disease rate (CR MRD-) of pevonedistat in&#xD;
      combination with cytarabine and idarubicin in newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase Ib, dose escalation study of pevonedistat followed by a phase II&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION: Patients receive idarubicin intravenously (IV) over 10-15 minutes on days 1-3,&#xD;
      cytarabine IV over 1-3 hours on days 1-7, and pevonedistat IV over 60 minutes on days 1, 3,&#xD;
      and 5. Patients with gross residual disease on day 14 bone marrow may receive a second course&#xD;
      of induction chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONSOLIDATION: Patients who achieve CR and will not undergo bone marrow transplant receive&#xD;
      cytarabine IV over 3 hours every 12 hours on days 1, 3, and 5. Treatment repeats every 28-35&#xD;
      days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unaccepted toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for at least 30 days, and then&#xD;
      every 3 months for 2 years.&#xD;

Survival curves will be plotted by the Kaplan-Meier (KM) method. Median RFS and their 95% confidence intervals, 1-year and 2- year survival rates and corresponding standard errors will be derived from the KM curves.</description>
