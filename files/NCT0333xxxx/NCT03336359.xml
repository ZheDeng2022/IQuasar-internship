  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized trial comparing the adenoma detection rate of LCI with NBI.&#xD;
      Eligible patients are randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to undergo tandem colonoscopy with&#xD;
      LCI (LCI group) or NBI (NBI group). Randomization will be carried out by computer generated&#xD;
      random sequences and stratified according to endoscopist's experiences (experienced versus&#xD;
      fellows) and indications of colonoscopy (symptomatic vs screening/surveillance).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of this study is to compare the adenoma or polyp detection rates by LCI&#xD;
      and NBI during the first examination. Secondary outcomes included adenoma/polyp miss rate by&#xD;
      LCI or NBI. Other outcomes include sessile serrated adenomas or polyps (SSA/P) detection&#xD;
      rates and advanced adenoma detection rates.&#xD;

      Study design and randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective randomized head-to-head trial comparing the adenoma detection rate of&#xD;
      LCI with NBI. Eligible patients are randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to undergo tandem&#xD;
      colonoscopy with LCI (LCI group) or NBI (NBI group). Randomization will be carried out by&#xD;
      computer generated random sequences and stratified according to endoscopist's experiences&#xD;
      (experienced versus fellows) and indications of colonoscopy (symptomatic vs&#xD;
      screening/surveillance). All procedures are performed with high-definition endoscopes and the&#xD;
      LASEREO endoscopic system (Fujifilm Co, Tokyo, Japan) or the EVIS- EXERA 290 video system&#xD;
      (Olympus Optical, Tokyo, Japan).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colonoscopy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are instructed to take low-residue diet two days before colonoscopy. Oral&#xD;
      polyethylene glycol lavage solution is used for bowel preparation (routine bowel&#xD;
      preparation). The assigned endoscopic system will be used and the colonoscope will advance to&#xD;
      cecum under WL in all patients. Cecal intubation is confirmed by identification of the&#xD;
      appendiceal orifice and ileocecal valve or by intubation of the ileum. Once cecal intubation&#xD;
      is performed, the colonoscope is withdrawn to the anus under LCI or NBI accordingly. All&#xD;
      detected polyps will be removed during this examination. The withdrawal time of the first&#xD;
      pass (minus the polypectomy site) will be measured by a stopwatch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The size (measured with biopsy forceps), location, and morphology of polyps are recorded by&#xD;
      an independent observer. The Boston Bowel Preparation Scale score is evaluated during&#xD;
      examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately after the first pass examination, a second examination will be performed by the&#xD;
      same colonoscope and the same endoscopist. The colonoscope will be reintroduced to the cecum&#xD;
      using WL and withdraw using the previously assigned method (ie LCI or NBI). Any polyp&#xD;
      detected on second pass examination will be removed and the withdrawal time of the second&#xD;
      pass will also be documented. All polyp specimens are clearly labelled for histological&#xD;
      examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histologic examination All resected and biopsy specimens are fixed in 10% buffered formalin&#xD;
      solution, and examined histologically by hematoxylin and eosin staining. The&#xD;
      histopathological diagnosis is determined by experienced pathologists, who are blinded to the&#xD;
      assigned endoscopic system, according to the World Health Organization (WHO)&#xD;
      criteria.Advanced adenomas are defined as adenoma â‰¥10 mm in diameter or with villous&#xD;
      histology in 25% or high-grade dysplasia (HGD), or carcinoma.&#xD;
