      The primary objectives of this study are to determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of&#xD;
      PAC-1 in combination with temozolomide in patients with high grade glioma: glioblastoma&#xD;
      multiforme (GBM) or anaplastic astrocytoma after progression following standard first line&#xD;
      therapy (Component 2), by evaluation of toxicity and tolerability.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      PAC-1 in combination with temozolomide (Component 2): after the MTD is established for single&#xD;
      agent PAC-1 in Component 1, a modified-Fibonacci dose-escalation 3+3 design starts in&#xD;
      Component 2, at a PAC-1 dose one level lower than the MTD of PAC-1 established in the single&#xD;
      agent PAC-1 component (i.e., Component 1) and 150 mg/m2 dose of temozolomide given for the 5&#xD;
      days starting at day 8 of cycle 1 in cohorts of 3-6 patients. The combination cohort that&#xD;
      reaches MTD will expanded to at least 9 patients, similar to the PAC-1 alone cohort at MTD.&#xD;
      For all dose cohorts, pharmacokinetics of PAC-1 will be assessed following doses administered&#xD;
      on days 1 and 11 of the first cycle. Temozolomide pharmacokinetics will be performed on Day&#xD;
      11 of the first cycle.&#xD;
