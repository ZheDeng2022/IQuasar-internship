    <textblock>
      Objective of this study is to assess the efficiency of NOVATEX MEDICAL compression garments&#xD;
      in patients with an Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To answer this objectif a comparison before/after use of compression garments will be&#xD;
      performed for all patients.&#xD;

      Inclusion period: 1 year Follow-up period: 26 months Study period : 38 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient visits will be organized as follow:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  V0: first visit at inclusion, clinical evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  V1: 4 months after inclusion, clinical evaluation without compression garments and&#xD;
           presure garments prescription&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  V2: 8 months after inclusion, clinical evaluation with compression garments&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  V3: 14 months after inclusion, clinical evaluation with compression garments&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  V4: 20 months after inclusion, clinical evaluation with compression garments&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  V5: 26 months after inclusion, clinical evaluation with compression garments&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only the first two visits are specific to the study to be able to compare before and after&#xD;
      the use of compression garments. Next visits are the usual visits (every 6 months) for the&#xD;
      use of compression garments in patients with an EDS.&#xD;

    <measure>Improvement of Functional Independence Measure (FIM) scale from 4 months at 8 months</measure>
    <time_frame>month 4, month 8</time_frame>
    <description>Functional Independence Measure (FIM) is an 18- Item of physical, psychological and social function.&#xD;
The FIM uses the level of assistance an individual needs to grade the functional status of a person.&#xD;
For each item, disability level is coded from 1 (Total Assistance or not Testable) to 7 (Complete Independence) A total score is calculated using an addition of all items. Thus, score ranges are [18;126]. More the score is high, better is the independence.&#xD;
The proportion of patients who present an improvement of 10% of the FIM score between 4 months and 8 months will be calculated.</description>

    <measure>Evolution of Pain (before and after compression garments using)</measure>
    <time_frame>Inclusion, month 4, month 8, month 14, month 20, month 26</time_frame>
    <description>Pain evolution using the VAS scale (from 0=no pain to 100=worst imaginable pain) The pain VAS is a continuous scale comprised of a horizontal line, 10 centimeters (100 mm) in length, anchored by 2 verbal descriptors, one for each symptom extreme.&#xD;
For each visit, proportion of patients who present a decrease of at least 30% of pain score from inclusion, or a pain score &lt;= 2, will be calculated.</description>

    <description>Tiredness evolution using Pichot scale Eight items are coded from 0 to 4 (0 = not at all, 1 = a little 2 = moderately 3 = much 4 = extremely).&#xD;
