  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tinnitus, or ringing in the ears, is a very common problem that often accompanies hearing&#xD;
      loss. It affects up to 1 in 10 adults, and about 30% of people who experience chronic&#xD;
      tinnitus find it very distressing. In these patients, symptoms of depression and anxiety&#xD;
      often accompany tinnitus and there are no approved treatments. Clinical trials are ongoing to&#xD;
      test a glutamate NMDA receptor antagonist (called esketamine), which is injected into the&#xD;
      inner ear. However, the preliminary results with this medication show that it only works for&#xD;
      tinnitus that results from acute injury. It does not treat tinnitus resulting from&#xD;
      progressive hearing loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research in humans and animals suggest that the neurotransmitters glutamate and GABA are&#xD;
      important in the development and maintenance of tinnitus. This data shows that&#xD;
      over-activation of the NMDA receptor and a decrease in GABA signaling in the brain play a&#xD;
      crucial role. Previous studies show that ketamine, which an antagonist at the NMDA receptor,&#xD;
      increases GABA levels in the brain in participants with depression. Thus, in this experiment,&#xD;
      this study will test the effect of ketamine on tinnitus, since it blocks the NMDA glutamate&#xD;
      receptor and increase GABA levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two groups of participants will be included in this study: those who experience distress&#xD;
      (symptoms of anxiety or depression) with tinnitus and those who have tinnitus but do not&#xD;
      experience distress. Each participant will receive both ketamine and placebo on different&#xD;
      days. Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) scans will be&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tinnitus has a prevalence of approximately 1 in 10 adults in the United States. Among those&#xD;
      with tinnitus, 36% had nearly constant symptoms and almost 30% of those report that their&#xD;
      tinnitus as a big or a very big problem. Currently there are few effective treatments for&#xD;
      tinnitus, and no approved medications. Cognitive behavioral and retraining therapy provide&#xD;
      some relief, but many patients fail to respond.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Animal research and human studies indicate that maladaptive plasticity plays a role in&#xD;
      tinnitus, which involves glutamatergic signaling largely at the NMDA and AMPA receptors.&#xD;
      Additionally, GABA signaling has been shown to be impaired in tinnitus. Rodent models show a&#xD;
      diminished sensitivity to GABA signaling and human magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)&#xD;
      studies show decreased GABA levels in the auditory cortex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ketamine is a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist that has also been shown to activate&#xD;
      AMPA receptors, and modulates ongoing plasticity. Additionally, ketamine activates a&#xD;
      subpopulation of cortical GABAergic interneurons and projection neurons and increases GABA&#xD;
      levels in the human brain, measured with MRS. Ketamine is FDA approved as an anesthetic, and&#xD;
      recent work has demonstrated its efficacy in treating refractory depression and chronic pain.&#xD;
      Importantly, these demonstrate that low dose ketamine, at doses lower than those required for&#xD;
      anesthesia, are effective in lifting depressed mood and improving the sensation of chronic&#xD;
      pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For many, tinnitus has an important affective component to it, with distress and co-morbid&#xD;
      symptoms of depression and anxiety. The onset and severity of tinnitus can correlate with&#xD;
      stressful events, and it has been posited that stress lowers the threshold of perception, and&#xD;
      unmasks tinnitus. Tinnitus then triggers more anxiety and depressed mood, which in turn&#xD;
      reinforces the symptoms. An advantage of ketamine may be its effect on depression and&#xD;
      anxiety, in addition to tinnitus, to interrupt this cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to perform a proof-of-concept preliminary study of ketamine in&#xD;
      tinnitus associated with sensori-neural hearing loss. This will be studied both in&#xD;
      participants who report depressed mood and anxiety and those who do not. MRS imaging will be&#xD;
      used to assess ketamine-induced changes in GABA in the auditory cortex.&#xD;
