    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of&#xD;
      doravirine (also called MK-1439 or DOR) and doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil&#xD;
      fumarate (also called MK-1439A or DOR/3TC/TDF) in HIV-1-infected children and adolescents.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and tolerability of DOR and&#xD;
      DOR/3TC/TDF in HIV-1-infected children and adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in two cohorts: Cohort 1 and Cohort 2. At study entry (Day 0),&#xD;
      participants in Cohort 1 will receive a single dose of DOR added to their current HIV&#xD;
      regimens. (The antiretroviral drugs in their current HIV regimens will not be provided by the&#xD;
      study.) Participants in Cohort 1 will undergo intensive PK evaluations, and they will have an&#xD;
      additional study visit at Week 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team in consultation with a Study Monitoring Committee will evaluate data from&#xD;
      Cohort 1 before enrolling participants in Cohort 2. Participants in Cohort 2 will receive&#xD;
      DOR/3TC/TDF once daily from Day 0 through Week 96. They will attend study visits at Weeks 1,&#xD;
      2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48, 64, 80, and 96. Study visits will include physical examinations,&#xD;
      PK evaluations, and blood and urine collection.&#xD;
