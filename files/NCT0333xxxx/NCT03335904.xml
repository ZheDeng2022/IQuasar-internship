  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is characterized by regular periods of no breathing (apnea)&#xD;
      or low levels of breathing (hypopnea) and leads to repeated periods of low oxygenation,&#xD;
      termed intermittent hypoxia that causes fluctuations in blood oxygen levels. This leads to&#xD;
      increased peripheral chemoreflex sensitivity that is thought to occur through the stimulation&#xD;
      of angiotensin-II, type-I receptors (AT1R) that are expressed primarily on glomus cells&#xD;
      within the peripheral chemoreflex and ultimately results in long lasting hypertension. The&#xD;
      goal of this study is to determine if AT1R receptor blockade can prevent the increase in&#xD;
      chemoreflex sensitivity following one night of hypoxia and improve the severity of SDB.&#xD;

      Objective: To determine the effects of angiotensin-II, type-I receptor (AT1R) blockade on the&#xD;
      relationship between ventilatory control and sleep disordered breathing (SDB) following a&#xD;
      night of hypoxic sleep in healthy humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification: Ventilatory adaptation to hypoxia is one of two major adaptations permitting&#xD;
      humans to acclimatize successfully to high altitude. As the partial pressure of oxygen falls&#xD;
      with ascent, the peripheral chemoreceptors are stimulated resulting in an increase in&#xD;
      ventilation. The initial hypoxic ventilatory response is aimed at augmenting alveolar PO2 and&#xD;
      subsequently arterial PO2, but results in a respiratory alkalosis that can only be&#xD;
      compensated for by the reduction of renal excretion of bicarbonate. Despite metabolic&#xD;
      compensation, both basal respiratory drive and peripheral chemoreceptor responsiveness remain&#xD;
      elevated. Both of these elements of respiratory control have contrasting implications for&#xD;
      breathing stability during sleep. The increase in basal ventilation at high altitude&#xD;
      attenuates plant gain, a term describing how effectively a change in ventilation changes&#xD;
      blood gases. Plant gain is determined by positioning the chemoreflex response on the&#xD;
      isometabolic hyperbola. When arterial PCO2 is reduced during acclimatization to high&#xD;
      altitude, the point of equilibrium is shifted to a steeper portion of the isometabolic&#xD;
      hyperbola where a larger change in ventilation is necessary to evoke a given change in&#xD;
      arterial PCO2. This feature is protective in nature and acts to stabilize breathing. However,&#xD;
      the slope of the relationship between ventilation and arterial PCO2, termed controller gain,&#xD;
      is greatly enhanced at high altitude and this may outweigh the effect on plant gain,&#xD;
      destabilizing breathing and predisposing to central sleep apnea. Treatments that reduce&#xD;
      controller gain without impacting plant gain might stabilize breathing and reduce the&#xD;
      severity of central sleep apnea at high altitude without negatively impacting successful&#xD;
      acclimatization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The carotid body chemoreceptors serve an important regulatory role in controlling alveolar&#xD;
      ventilation and their sensitivity is augmented at high altitude. Recent studies have&#xD;
      established that the carotid body possesses a local angiotensin system, which contributes to&#xD;
      the sensitization of the chemoreflex function in patients with heart failure, sleep apnea,&#xD;
      and following exposure to intermittent hypoxia. Indeed, the over-activity of the carotid body&#xD;
      contributes to breathing instability and increases the incidence of central apneas.&#xD;
      Angiotensin II activates the carotid body and leads to afferent activity. The Type I cells&#xD;
      within the carotid body act as a chemical sensor and they express both angiotensinogen and&#xD;
      express two angiotensin receptors, AT1R and AT2R. Interestingly, pharmacological blockade of&#xD;
      the AT1R has little functional significance at sea level in the normal state. But if&#xD;
      chemoreceptor activity is augmented in conditions such as chronic, and intermittent hypoxia,&#xD;
      and congestive heart failure, then blockade of the AT1R partially reverses this activity.&#xD;
      Whether or not AT1R blockade at high altitude can attenuate the rise in chemoreceptor&#xD;
      sensitivity and reduce the severity of sleep apnea in humans is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: To determine if blockade of the AT1R can attenuate the ventilatory response to CO2&#xD;
      and reduce the severity of sleep disordered breathing in healthy humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Blockade of the AT1R will reduce the ventilatory sensitivity to CO2 and the&#xD;
      severity of SDB in healthy humans following one night of hypoxia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design General Procedures: Sleep studies will be conducted between 2100hrs and 0600&#xD;
      hrs. Participants will arrive at the laboratory in the evening and will be allowed to sleep&#xD;
      in the hypoxic chamber for 8 hours. Ventilatory responses will be assessed prior to entering&#xD;
      the hypoxic chamber and immediately upon waking in the morning following sleep study. Either&#xD;
      Losartan, an AT1R antagonist, (50 mg/dose; P.O.) or placebo will be administered three times&#xD;
      throughout the protocol: the morning of the experimental day, the evening one hour prior to&#xD;
      the ventilatory tests and finally the following morning after a night in the hypoxic chamber,&#xD;
      one hour prior to the second battery of ventilatory tests. This protocol design is&#xD;
      randomized, double blinded and placebo controlled and all participants will complete both&#xD;
      experimental arms separated by at least 2 days (i.e. cross-over study design). During the&#xD;
      ventilatory tests, participants will be studied in the supine position, 6 hours post-prandial&#xD;
      &amp; 24 hours post-caffeine, and breathing through a standard mouthpiece with a nose clamp.&#xD;
      Non-invasive measures of heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), respiratory frequency (fB),&#xD;
      tidal volume (VT), minute ventilation (VÌ‡E), cerebral blood flow [assessed by transcranial&#xD;
      Doppler (MCA and PCA)], end-tidal gases (PETCO2 and PETO2) and blood oxygen saturation (SpO2;&#xD;
      finger pulse oximetry) will be monitored and recorded continuously. Venipuncture will be&#xD;
      performed immediately prior to both ventilatory response tests and will be analyzed for&#xD;
      plasma renin activity levels to confirm functional angiotensin receptor blockade.&#xD;
