      Smoking remains the leading cause of preventable death in the United States, and current&#xD;
      first-line treatments leave the majority of tobacco dependent individuals unable to quit. The&#xD;
      inability to quit despite motivation to do so, is thought to result in part, from&#xD;
      self-control failure. Working memory (WM) deficits contribute to imbalanced self-control and&#xD;
      allow automatic impulses to drive behavior. Thus, WM plays a critical role in addictive&#xD;
      behavior, and is particularly relevant to smoking. Indeed, a strong link between WM and&#xD;
      smoking has been established in the literature; most notably, degree of WM impairment and&#xD;
      deficits in activation in associated brain regions predict time to relapse, and WM moderates&#xD;
      the relationship between craving and relapse. Given these insights, researchers have been&#xD;
      examining interventions that may target WM including WM training (WMT) and repetitive&#xD;
      Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS). WMT involves taxing this executive function&#xD;
      repeatedly over time and has shown positive preliminary results in improving measures of&#xD;
      self-control and reducing consumption of addictive substances. Similarly, rTMS, a&#xD;
      non-invasive brain stimulation procedure that stimulates neuronal tissues and increases&#xD;
      cortical excitability, has been shown to increase WM capacity and reduce craving and&#xD;
      consumption of several addictive substances including nicotine. While these interventions&#xD;
      have demonstrated initial promise in affecting addictive behaviors, the magnitude and&#xD;
      durability of their effects may be limited. Recently, researchers have posited - but not yet&#xD;
      empirically tested - that WMT administered in combination with rTMS may result in an additive&#xD;
      or supra-additive effect in treating addictive processes. This is highly significant; the&#xD;
      clinical utility of rTMS over current first line treatments may be limited if factors with&#xD;
      potential to enhance its effectiveness are not examined. Given these recent advances in the&#xD;
      literature, the primary objective of the proposed study is to evaluate the individual and&#xD;
      combined effects of Working Memory (WM) training and repetitive Transcranial Magnetic&#xD;
      Stimulation (rTMS) on WM performance and smoking behaviors as well as critical mediators of&#xD;
      these effects. These aims will be examined in a sample of tobacco dependent adults (N=130)&#xD;
      utilizing a 2x2 factorial experimental design including four groups (WMT+rTMS, sham WMT+rTMS,&#xD;
      WMT+sham TMS, and sham WMT+sham rTMS) capable of isolating independent and combined effects&#xD;
      of WMT and rTMS.&#xD;

      SPECIFIC AIMS Smoking remains the leading cause of preventable death in the U.S. Current&#xD;
      first line treatments leave approximately 70% of tobacco dependent individuals unsuccessful&#xD;
      in their attempt to quit. Specifically, only 5-30% of those who initiate treatment, including&#xD;
      intensive first-line interventions, are able to maintain abstinence for one or more years.&#xD;
      The inability to quit despite motivation to do so is thought to result, in part, from&#xD;
      self-control failure and can be understood within the framework of dual process models of&#xD;
      addiction. Dual process models view vulnerability to tobacco dependence as the relative&#xD;
      balance between automatic impulses and control processes orchestrated through the interplay&#xD;
      of multiple executive function. Working memory (WM) is an executive function associated with&#xD;
      updating information to solve immediate problems, and achieve current goals. WM is a key&#xD;
      cognitive process underlying the regulatory control component of dual process models and is&#xD;
      involved in the initiation, maintenance, and relapse stages of tobacco dependence. Most&#xD;
      notably, deficits in WM performance and activation in associated brain regions predict time&#xD;
      to relapse and strong WM has been shown to reduce the effect of craving on the ability to&#xD;
      resist smoking. Given this relationship, individuals with tobacco dependence are likely to&#xD;
      benefit from interventions that strengthen WM. Recently, several studies have demonstrated&#xD;
      that increasing WM capacity through WM training (WMT) is associated with positive outcomes in&#xD;
      several populations with substance use or impulse control disorders. Specifically, studies&#xD;
      have demonstrated that WMT is associated with decreased: delay discounting in substance&#xD;
      users, weight re-gain after a weight loss program, and alcohol use in heavy drinkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second emerging innovation in the treatment of addictions is repetitive Transcranial&#xD;
      Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS), a procedure which sends magnetic pulses through the scalp to&#xD;
      stimulate neuronal tissue resulting in observed changes in neuronal plasticity and striatal&#xD;
      dopamine. rTMS has now demonstrated positive effects in several substance use disorders&#xD;
      including nicotine, alcohol, and stimulant dependence. This procedure has been shown to be&#xD;
      effective in reducing smoking urges in abstinent as well as satiated smokers and to reduce&#xD;
      cigarette consumption. While promising results for this treatment have been demonstrated, the&#xD;
      size and durability of the therapeutic effect may be limited. Additionally, the mechanism by&#xD;
      which rTMS exerts positive effects on smoking outcomes is unknown. Recently it has been&#xD;
      posited that changes in WM performance resulting from rTMS may be the key pathway to its&#xD;
      observed effects on smoking related outcomes, and furthermore that WMT administered in close&#xD;
      temporal precedence to rTMS may result in an additive or supra-additive effect in treating&#xD;
      addictive processes. However, these hypotheses have not been tested to date despite their&#xD;
      importance for understanding and improving the clinical impact of these emerging therapeutic&#xD;
      modalities for treating addictive behaviors. Interventions with the ability to effectively&#xD;
      target self-control processes fill in a critical gap in currently available treatment&#xD;
      options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the proposed study is to evaluate the potential for improved effects&#xD;
      and examine mediating pathways of WMT in combination with rTMS on a laboratory based smoking&#xD;
      task and neuropsychological measures of WM performance. These aims will be examined in a&#xD;
      sample of tobacco dependent adults (N=130) utilizing a 2x2 factorial design including four&#xD;
      groups (WMT+rTMS, sham WMT+rTMS, WMT+sham TMS, and sham WMT+sham rTMS) capable of isolating&#xD;
      independent and combined effects of WMT and rTMS. The study will include a baseline&#xD;
      laboratory assessment, 10 WMT sessions over two weeks, followed by 10 days of WMT immediately&#xD;
      preceding and following brain stimulation sessions (10 Hz rTMS, 2000 pulses per session,&#xD;
      applied to left DLPFC). Neurocognitive and psychological mediators will be assessed between&#xD;
      baseline and final laboratory assessment. Lastly, a follow-up assessment will occur one-month&#xD;
      after the final laboratory visit. The proposed study will test the following Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To test the potential for improved effects of combining WMT with rTMS on smoking&#xD;
      behaviors as compared to the independent effects of either condition alone. Hypothesis:&#xD;
      Single active conditions (WMT+sham rTMS and sham WMT+rTMS) will result in significant&#xD;
      increases in time to lapse on an analogue task as compared to the double sham condition (sham&#xD;
      WMT+sham rTMS), and the WMT+rTMS condition will result in significant increases in time to&#xD;
      lapse as compared to the single active conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To test the potential for improved effects of combining WMT with rTMS on WM&#xD;
      performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: WMT + rTMS will result in significant increases in WM performance as compared to&#xD;
      all other conditions, including the additive increases in conditions outlined in Aim 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To test mediating pathways of the effects rTMS on smoking behaviors including changes&#xD;
      in craving, mood, and WM performance. Hypothesis: The direct effect of rTMS on smoking&#xD;
      outcomes will be mediated by gains in WM performance, and this effect will be largest in the&#xD;
      WMT+rTMS condition.&#xD;

    <description>The Working Memory Training condition: This condition will include 30 sessions across 4 weeks (10 remote sessions prior to initiation of the rTMS stimulation, and 20 lab sessions on rTMS stimulation days). Participants will complete three distinct WM tasks in each session: a visuospatial WM task, a backward digit span task, and a letter span task. In the training condition, the difficulty level of all three WM tasks will be automatically adjusted on a trial-by-trial basis. An identical protocol and software have demonstrated efficacy in increasing WM capacity, and this improvement in WM predicts reduction in addictive behavior.</description>
