             during the treatment period - Photodynamic therapy or immunomodulators, cytotoxic&#xD;
             drugs, or interferon/interferon inducers within 4 weeks prior to study entry or&#xD;
             expected during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Women of child-bearing potential, unless they are using at least basic methods of&#xD;
