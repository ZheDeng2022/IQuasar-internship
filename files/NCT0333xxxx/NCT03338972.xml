      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of BCMA CAR-T cells in treating&#xD;
      patients with BCMA positive multiple myeloma that has come back or does not respond to&#xD;
      treatment. T cells are a type of white blood cell and a major component of the immune system.&#xD;
      T-cells that have been genetically modified in the laboratory express BCMA and may kill&#xD;
      cancer cells with the protein BCMA on their surface. Giving chemotherapy before BCMA CAR-T&#xD;
      cells may reduce the amount of disease and to cause a low lymphocyte (white blood cell) count&#xD;
      in the blood, which may help the infused BCMA CAR-T cells survive and expand.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety of adoptive therapy with ex vivo expanded autologous CD8+ plus CD4+&#xD;
      T cells transduced to express a human B cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-targeting chimeric&#xD;
      antigen receptor (CAR) for patients with relapsed or treatment refractory multiple myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the duration of in vivo persistence and the phenotype of long lived CAR-T&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the degree to which adoptively transferred T cells traffic to multiple&#xD;
      myeloma (MM) cells in the bone marrow (BM) and function in vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To estimate the antitumor activity of adoptively transferred BCMA-specific&#xD;
      CAR-expressing T lymphocytes (BCMA CAR-T cells).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of BCMA-specific CAR-expressing T lymphocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo leukapheresis to obtain their immune cells, from which CAR-T cells are&#xD;
      produced. A few weeks later, patients then receive cyclophosphamide and fludarabine on days&#xD;
      -4 to -2. Beginning 36-96 hours after chemotherapy, patients receive BCMA-specific&#xD;
      CAR-expressing T lymphocytes intravenously (IV) over 20-30 minutes on day 0. Patients may&#xD;
      receive a second dose of BCMA-specific CAR-expressing T lymphocytes IV with or without&#xD;
      additional cytoreductive chemotherapy at the discretion of the principal investigator or&#xD;
      their designee (sub-investigator).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 60, 90, 120, 180, and 365&#xD;
      days and then annually up to 15 years.&#xD;
