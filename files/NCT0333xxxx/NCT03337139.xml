  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most adults in the U.S. are overweight or obese and find maintenance of weight loss&#xD;
      difficult. This study is designed to aid in the development of a lifestyle modification&#xD;
      program that can facilitate weight loss maintenance, without requiring long-term visits to a&#xD;
      clinic for maintenance treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a lifestyle modification program, contact with an interventionist (e.g., weight loss&#xD;
      coach) creates a sense of supportive accountability that can facilitate behavior change and&#xD;
      weight loss. Sustaining a strong sense of supportive accountability after face-to-face&#xD;
      intervention contact ends has the potential to improve outcomes during the notoriously&#xD;
      difficult weight loss maintenance period. One innovative way of facilitating supportive&#xD;
      accountability is providing participants with digital tools that objectively measure weight&#xD;
      and physical activity and track food intake in real-time, making the data from those tools&#xD;
      automatically and continuously available to coaches, and designing the timing and content of&#xD;
      intervention contacts such that they are responsive to the shared data. Although tools that&#xD;
      allow for data sharing from sensors and Internet-based applications are readily available,&#xD;
      the ways in which they are integrated into intervention contacts in a lifestyle modification&#xD;
      program are not yet optimized, and research has not systematically evaluated the effect of&#xD;
      data sharing on behavior. Overweight and obese participants (n = 90) will be recruited from&#xD;
      the community for a small randomized controlled trial in order to test the feasibility,&#xD;
      acceptability, efficacy, and mechanisms of action of a lifestyle modification intervention&#xD;
      enhanced with data sharing. In weeks 1-12 of the program (i.e., Phase I), all participants&#xD;
      will attend 12 weekly, face-to-face, group-based behavioral treatment sessions to induce&#xD;
      weight loss. Participants will be provided with a wireless body weight scale, physical&#xD;
      activity sensor, and digital food record app and instructed to use them daily use for&#xD;
      self-monitoring purposes. In Phase II (weeks 13-52), participants will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to the standard (LM) or enhanced version of remote lifestyle modification (LM+SHARE). Neither&#xD;
      condition will have face-to-face intervention contact during Phase II; remote intervention&#xD;
      contact will consist of brief phone calls and text messages provided by the participant's&#xD;
      coach. Participants in both conditions will be prescribed continued daily use of the three&#xD;
      self-monitoring devices. In the standard LM condition, no digital data from these devices&#xD;
      will be directly shared with coaches; intervention encounters will be informed only by the&#xD;
      infrequent, delayed self-report of participants (which is the current standard of long-term&#xD;
      obesity care), and timing of text messages will be fixed. In LM+SHARE, the digital tools will&#xD;
      automatically and continuously transmit body weight, physical activity, and food record data&#xD;
      to the coach. In LM+SHARE, supportive accountability will be enhanced in three ways: 1)&#xD;
      participants will receive automated alerts after coaches view their data, 2) timing of&#xD;
      personalized text messages from coaches will be responsive to clinically notable change in&#xD;
      weight, physical activity, calorie intake, or use of scale, physical activity sensor, or food&#xD;
      record tool, and 3) content of the text messages and phone calls will be informed by the&#xD;
      digital data the coach has viewed, as well as the expectation that the coach will continue&#xD;
      viewing data in order to provide ongoing support. Assessments will be completed at 0, 12, 26,&#xD;
      and 52 weeks.&#xD;

    <description>Feasibility and acceptability metric of scores on the TAQ. Items on the TAQ consisted of 11 questions on a 7 point Likert scale asking about helpfulness and acceptability of treatment components. Items are summed to yield a total score that can range from 11-77 with higher numbers indicated higher acceptability.</description>

    <time_frame>13-52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Use of digital devices; percent of days during which weight, food, and steps were counted in Phase II. Percent calculated for each group (LM vs. LM+Share) and not for individual participants. We determined percent to be the metric that would be most easily interpreted and it accounted for any possible variability in total number of days of observations.</description>

    <measure>Perceived Accountability</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in &quot;Perceptions of Accountability&quot; subscale of the Supportive Accountability Scale. The measure used was a 10-item scale on which participants rated the extent to which they agreed with statements on a 7-point likert scale. A total score was generated by summing scores from individual items. Total scores ranged from 10-70 with higher scorings indicating higher perceived accountability. The outcome measure reported here is the change in total score on this measure (decrease) across Phase II where a negative score reflects a decrease in perceived accountability.</description>

        <description>Change in &quot;Perceptions of Accountability&quot; subscale of the Supportive Accountability Scale. The measure used was a 10-item scale on which participants rated the extent to which they agreed with statements on a 7-point likert scale. A total score was generated by summing scores from individual items. Total scores ranged from 10-70 with higher scorings indicating higher perceived accountability. The outcome measure reported here is the change in total score on this measure (decrease) across Phase II where a negative score reflects a decrease in perceived accountability.</description>
