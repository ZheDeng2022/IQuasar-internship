  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluated the effect of food on the absorption of the drug as well as safety and&#xD;
      tolerability in adults suffering from chronic Chagas' disease In addition pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      the drug following 120 and 240 mg single doses will be assessed&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary objective was to evaluate the effect of various food compositions on the PK of&#xD;
      nifurtimox after a single oral dose (120 mg) administered under 3 types of fed conditions&#xD;
      (low fat, dairy products, and high calorie and high fat), as well as fasted conditions, to&#xD;
      assess relative bioavailability. It was chosen to allow a direct inter-study comparison of PK&#xD;
      data obtained in previous studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary objective of the study was to assess the relative bioavailability of 2 different&#xD;
      dose levels of nifurtimox, given as a single oral dose, in a second group of patients.The&#xD;
      second treatment group addressed a biopharmaceutical aspect for which no study data have been&#xD;
      obtained to date. In order to assess the relationship between dose and exposure (linearity of&#xD;
      PK), an analysis of the dose range of 120 mg to 240 mg was chosen to close the knowledge gap&#xD;
      for this dose range.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent must be provided before any study-specific tests or&#xD;
             procedures are performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male/female patient diagnosed with chronic Chagas' disease:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Previous diagnosis of acute or chronic Chagas' disease by a health clinic prior to&#xD;
        screening for the study. The diagnosis of chronic Chagas' disease may be made by clinical&#xD;
        findings, supported by antibody titers if available. If there is a known history of acute&#xD;
        disease, it is preferable to have documentation of parasites on the blood smear, if&#xD;
        available.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women and men of reproductive potential must agree to use adequate contraception when&#xD;
             sexually active. This applies for the time period between signing of the informed&#xD;
             consent form and 12 weeks after the last administration of study drug. The definition&#xD;
             of adequate contraception will be based on the judgment of the investigator and on&#xD;
             local requirements. Acceptable methods of contraception include, but are not limited&#xD;
             to: (i) condoms (male or female) with or without a spermicidal agent; (ii) diaphragm&#xD;
             or cervical cap with spermicide; (iii) intra-uterine device; (iv) hormone-based&#xD;
             contraception. Subjects must agree to utilize two reliable and acceptable methods of&#xD;
             contraception simultaneously.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential with confirmed last menstrual period by anamnesis and&#xD;
             negative serum pregnancy test (beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [βhCG]) at screening&#xD;
             and negative urine pregnancy test (βhCG) at pre-dose of each treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of non-childbearing potential, such as surgically sterile women with either&#xD;
             written documentation of surgical sterility or negative serum pregnancy test (βhCG) at&#xD;
             screening and negative urine pregnancy test (βhCG) at pre-dose of each treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male subjects who agree not to act as sperm donors for 12 weeks after last&#xD;
             administration of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age: 18 to 45 years (inclusive) at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body mass index (BMI): ≥18 and &lt;29.9 kg/m².&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Incompletely cured pre-existing diseases (except chronic Chagas' disease without&#xD;
             active GI condition) for which it can be assumed that the absorption, distribution,&#xD;
             metabolism, elimination, and effects of the study drugs will not be normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acute Chagas' disease. (During the acute phase, the parasite on a blood smear may be&#xD;
             seen under a microscope. Different antibodies are present, depending on the course of&#xD;
             the disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known hypersensitivity to the study drug (active substance or excipients of the&#xD;
             preparations)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unstable or uncontrolled medical condition such as hypertension or diabetes,&#xD;
             decompensated heart failure, GI conditions that would interfere with the absorption of&#xD;
             the study drug (e.g. GI ulceration, peptic ulceration, GI bleeding, gastroesophageal&#xD;
             reflux, or other GI disease affecting gastroesophageal junction), conditions that&#xD;
             could potentially have an impact on drug metabolism or elimination (renal, hepatic&#xD;
             such as known hepatic or biliary abnormalities), or any clinically relevant active&#xD;
             infections in the opinion of the investigator within 4 weeks before the screening&#xD;
             visit, e.g. clinically relevant history or presence of significant respiratory (e.g.&#xD;
             interstitial lung disease), hematological, lymphatic, neurological, cardiovascular,&#xD;
             psychiatric, musculoskeletal, genitourinary, immunological, metabolic (e.g. diabetes),&#xD;
             and dermatological or connective tissue disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of systemic or topical medicines or substances which oppose the study objectives&#xD;
             (including clinical treatment with nifurtimox and benznidazole) or which might&#xD;
             influence them within 4 weeks before the first study drug administration, e.g. an&#xD;
             investigational drug, any drug altering GI motility and/or gastric pH (e.g. antacids,&#xD;
             anticholinergic, para-sympatholytics), any drug known to induce liver enzymes (e.g.&#xD;
             dexamethasone, barbiturates, St. John's Wort [hypericum perforatum]), any drug known&#xD;
             to inhibit liver enzymes (e.g. ketoconazole, macrolides).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically relevant findings in the ECG such as a second- or third-degree&#xD;
             atrioventricular block, prolongation of the QRS complex over 120 msec or of the QT&#xD;
             interval over 450 msec using Bazett's formula (QTcB). (Clinically stable subjects with&#xD;
             Chagas'-related heart disease and pacemaker in place for &gt;1 year and evaluated by a&#xD;
             cardiologist ≤6 months before the first dose of study drug will not be excluded.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Systolic blood pressure &lt;100 or &gt;140 mmHg (after resting in supine position for a&#xD;
             minimum of 3 minutes).&#xD;
&#xD;
