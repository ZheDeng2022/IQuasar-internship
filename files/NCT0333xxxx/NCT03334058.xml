  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is an open-label, non-controlled, adaptive-design Phase II study to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and conditions of use&#xD;
      (dosage, frequency of administration at maintenance) of ARGX-113 in patients with mild to&#xD;
      moderate Pemphigus (Vulgaris or Foliaceus), either newly diagnosed or relapsing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total study duration for each patient is less than 6 months. It consists of a Screening&#xD;
      period, an Induction, a maintenance treatment period followed by a treatment-free Follow-up&#xD;
      (FU) period.&#xD;

             patients off therapy on a first course of oral prednisone at stable dose for at least&#xD;
             2 weeks and for whom ARGX-113 monotherapy is considered not clinically acceptable; or&#xD;
             patients who relapse despite oral prednisone at tapered dose +/- a conventional&#xD;

             immunoadsorption).&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Use of rituximab and other CD20 target biologics within 6 months prior to Baseline&#xD;
             visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. History of anaphylactic reaction, or a known hypersensitivity reaction to one of the&#xD;
             components of the IMP.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. History of vaccination within the last 4 weeks prior to Baseline visit, or with a&#xD;
             planned vaccination during the study, with the exception of seasonal vaccination (e.g.&#xD;

&#xD;
               5. International normalized ratio (INR) &gt; 1.5 or activated partial thromboplastin&#xD;
