  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a prevalent chronic condition that gradually leads&#xD;
      to the three dimensional deformity of the spine. Spine curvature increases in youths as&#xD;
      puberty progresses. Generally, only observation is suggested for adolescents with early&#xD;
      scoliosis (Cobb's angle ≤ 20°). Rigid brace treatment is too draconian for them due to the&#xD;
      high corrective force which nearly constrains all movements. Flexible brace treatment is an&#xD;
      alternative option; however, its efficacy is still controversial. Posture correction girdle&#xD;
      with a specialized design for teenagers with scoliosis is limited and most part of them can&#xD;
      only provide some improvement for bad postures, such as hunchback. A scientific approach&#xD;
      should be used to design and develop posture correction girdle as a treatment option for&#xD;
      adolescents with early scoliosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The design of posture correction girdle will incorporate different mechanisms, such as&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. compression and pulling forces through a close fit of the intimate apparel&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. lumbar flexion by using a supporting belt&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. transverse forces applied by inserting pads inside the pocket lining by using the&#xD;
           principle of the 3-point pressure system&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. axial rotation or coupled motion by using a system with uneven straps, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. an active mechanism that aims to shift the trunk away from areas of pressure.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will be invited to undergo a fitting session of posture correction girdle. After the fitting, participants will join a 6-month wear trial of the posture correction girdle. Participants are required to wear the girdle for 8 hours a day and the compliance will be recorded by a logbook daily. Participants will be invited to undergo assessments before the wear trial, after the trial of 3 months, and after the trial of 6 months. The measure outcomes of the assessment include 1) ultrasound scanning image, 2) 3D body scan, 3) electromyography signal, 4) garment pressure, and 5) questionnaire.</description>
