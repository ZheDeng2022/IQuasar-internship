    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate and compare two strategies of portion control in&#xD;
      toddlers aged 24 to 59 months (snack replacement and snack reduction). The investigators aim&#xD;
      to compare the effect of these strategies on habitual dietary intake (total energy intake&#xD;
      (kcal), sugar intake (g), intake of fruits and vegetables, and intake at a test meal provided&#xD;
      in the home (total energy intake (kcal) and intake of each component of the meal, e.g. intake&#xD;
      of vegetables). Outcome measures will be compared to baseline within strategies and also&#xD;
      between strategies to explore which portion control strategy might be most effective.&#xD;

      Following provision of informed consent the primary caregiver will be provided with a&#xD;
      recruitment questionnaire. The questionnaire can be completed on paper or online (identical&#xD;
      questionnaires). It will include the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ; Hammond et al., 1993)&#xD;
      to determine whether the child likes and regularly eats HED snacks. A FFQ will also be&#xD;
      administered to the main caregiver in order to establish familial patterns of food intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic information will be collected for both caregivers and child in paper or online&#xD;
      format. Measures of child eating behaviour, parental feeding practices, food neophobia and&#xD;
      temperament will be taken. Anthropometric information of the child will also be collected by&#xD;
      the researcher to calculate weight-for-height z scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A between-subject 3-week intervention will be implemented with participants acting as their&#xD;
      own controls during the baseline (week 1) and acclimation (week 2) periods before being&#xD;
      randomised in to the intervention period (week 3) (figure 1). Caregivers will be instructed&#xD;
      to complete a 4-day weighed food diary each week (3 weekdays and at least one weekend day).&#xD;
      This will involve the caregiver recording all food and drinks consumed by their child to the&#xD;
      nearest gram using the scales provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During week 1 (baseline) parents will be instructed to make no alterations to the foods and&#xD;
      drinks that they provide to their child. Data from this phase of the experiment will be used&#xD;
      to examine the habitual diet. Data obtained in this phase will enable us to determine whether&#xD;
      or not the provision of the snacks has changed the child's dietary habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During week 2 (acclimation phase) participants will be provided with a range of snacks that&#xD;
      are intended to replace all usual snacks. This will consist of several different snack&#xD;
      options (figure 2) to provide up to three snacks per day and to allow for any siblings who&#xD;
      may want an identical snack option. All participants will be provided with the same selection&#xD;
      of HED snacks, which will be familiar to all children. Snack types and amounts will be based&#xD;
      on data collected from the cohort prior to the beginning of the experiment when participants&#xD;
      express an interest in taking part. Parents/ caregivers will be required to replace all usual&#xD;
      snacks with the ones provided over the following 7 days and will be instructed to provide the&#xD;
      snacks at their child's usual snack time following a snacking schedule, and to record it in&#xD;
      the food diary; this will allow the snacking schedule to be matched in week three. If parents&#xD;
      usually provide fruit or vegetables (in their natural form) for a snack occasion they will be&#xD;
      instructed to continue to do so. HED snacks are being provided in this pilot study to ensure&#xD;
      consistency across all children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In week 3 parents will be randomly allocated (block randomisation) to one of two portion size&#xD;
      reduction interventions via simple randomisation procedure (snack reduction or snack&#xD;
      replacement). Caregivers will be instructed to either reduce all snacks by 50% or replace all&#xD;
      snacks with familiar and relatively liked fruits, vegetables and a starch component&#xD;
      (breadstick, cracker or rice cake). In the snack reduction condition parents and caregivers&#xD;
      will be provided with the same snacks as in week 2 and a snacking schedule showing the&#xD;
      amounts and types of snacks that should be offered to the child (as per week 2). Once the&#xD;
      downsized snack (50% portion) has been consumed, if the child indicates that they are still&#xD;
      hungry, caregivers will be advised to offer any other low energy dense foods such as fruits&#xD;
      and vegetables. In the replacement condition, caregivers will be instructed to remove all HED&#xD;
      snacks that were provided in week 2 or otherwise and sugar sweetened beverages from the&#xD;
      child's diet for one week and offer only the fruits and vegetables, starch-based food (bread&#xD;
      stick, rice cake or cracker) and sugar free drinks provided. All participants in the snack&#xD;
      replacement group will be provided with a snack pack consisting of fruits and vegetables&#xD;
      familiar and relatively liked to all children (for example apples, grapes, pears, banana, red&#xD;
      pepper, cucumber, cherry tomatoes and carrots (all served raw)). The fruit and vegetable&#xD;
      types will be based on the data collected on children familiarity of fruits and vegetables&#xD;
      from the cohort prior to week 1.Caregivers will be instructed to offer 40g of both a&#xD;
      specified fruit and vegetable (more if the child requests) and a pre-defined starch&#xD;
      component. This is based on a typical portion size for a pre-school child. A snacking&#xD;
      schedule will also be provided for the fruits and vegetables.&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children who attend nursery for more than three full consecutive days will be excluded&#xD;
             due to the requirement of a four-day consecutive food diary to be completed in the&#xD;
             home environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children with food allergies, long-term health conditions known to affect food intake,&#xD;
