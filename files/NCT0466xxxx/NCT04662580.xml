      A Phase 1, Multicenter, Open-label, Dose-escalation, and Dose expansion Study to Evaluate the&#xD;
      Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Anti-tumor Activity of ARX517 in Subjects with Advanced Solid&#xD;
      Tumor with known PSMA Who Failed Prior Standard Therapies&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human, Phase 1, multicenter, open-label, single arm, dose escalation, and&#xD;
      dose expansion study to evaluate the safety, PK, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of&#xD;
      ARX517 in adult subjects with advanced solid tumor who failed prior standard therapies. The&#xD;
      study includes 2 parts: a dose-escalation part (Part 1) and a dose-expansion part (Part 2).&#xD;
      In Part 1, the subject will be enrolled with a starting dose of 0.32 mg/kg, and the study&#xD;
      will evaluate up to 6 dose levels of ARX517 (0.32 mg/kg, 0.64 mg/kg, 1.07 mg/kg, 1.4 mg/kg,&#xD;
      1.7 mg/kg, and 2.0 mg/kg) by intravenous infusion once every 3 weeks (Q3W). If the planned&#xD;
      highest dose level of 2.0 mg/kg is well tolerated, a higher dose level of ARX517 may be&#xD;
      evaluated based on the SMC recommendation. Similarly, doses lower than the pre-specified&#xD;
      lowest dose of 0.32 mg/kg and additional intermediate dose levels of ARX517 may also be&#xD;
      considered if needed. Decisions about enrollment suspension, resumption, and study&#xD;
      termination will be made by the Sponsor based on recommendations from SMC. DLT will be&#xD;
      evaluated in the first cycle of 21 days for Q3W. MTD and /or putative recommended phase II&#xD;
      dose (RP2D) will be selected based on all available safety, tolerability, PK, and primary&#xD;
      anti-tumor activity data. To ensure that the selected RP2D is not associated with an&#xD;
      increased risk of serious adverse events, multiple &quot;putative RP2D&quot; doses may be selected for&#xD;
      further evaluation based on SMC recommendation. The number of subjects to be enrolled in the&#xD;
      dose-expansion part will be based on the number of doses selected for expansion and the&#xD;
      results of the dose escalation part. Part 2 will not exceed 40 subjects.&#xD;
