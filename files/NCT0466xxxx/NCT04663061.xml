  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study team will study the efficacy of a high intensity medical weight loss intervention&#xD;
      paired with a digital platform to create weight loss and induce remission of type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus (T2DM) compared to a diabetes self-management education intervention. The digital&#xD;
      platform provides the capability to tailor the treatment plan, provide automated support, and&#xD;
      alert providers when a participant may need more support from the clinical team. If shown to&#xD;
      be efficacious, this research could be highly impactful, causing us to rethink our approach&#xD;
      to care for those with T2DM and shift the paradigm for millions of individuals in the United&#xD;
      States. Furthermore, this approach will demonstrate the feasibility of helping people engage&#xD;
      in metabolic treatment strategies in a way that is scalable leveraging digital and mobile&#xD;
      solutions that extend the patient-provider relationship, shift care from episodic approaches&#xD;
      to more of an on-going model that extends into the life of the patient, while also integrated&#xD;
      within the healthcare system workflows.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This project will determine if a data-assisted, high intensity medical weight loss&#xD;
      intervention (HIWL) will lead to significant weight loss and diabetes remission in&#xD;
      individuals with a Body Mass Index (BMI) 30-39.9 kg/m2 with T2DM of less than 6 years as&#xD;
      compared to a diabetes self-management education intervention (DSME). Complete diabetes&#xD;
      remission is considered to be achieved when the patient is not taking any anti-diabetes&#xD;
      medication for at least 12 months, and the Glycated Hemoglobin (HbA1c) is &lt; 5.7%. Partial&#xD;
      remission is achieved when the patient is not taking any anti-diabetes medication and has an&#xD;
      HbA1c of 5.7-6.4% for at least 12 months.Using a randomized controlled study design, we will&#xD;
      randomly assign 90 participants to HIWL, HIWL + continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), or DSME.&#xD;
      Participants assigned to HIWL will receive a high intensity behavioral weight loss&#xD;
      intervention delivered using a digital patient engagement platform. Participants will be&#xD;
      prescribed a low calorie dietary plan and a recommended physical activity program designed to&#xD;
      produce 15-20% weight loss over 12 months. Those assigned to HIWL + CGM will receive the same&#xD;
      intervention as HIWL; in addition we will provide them with CGM to use as part of their&#xD;
      remote monitoring on a daily basis. Those assigned to DSME will participate in a&#xD;
      comprehensive diabetes education program designed to provide education and skills for optimal&#xD;
      diabetes management plus lifestyle modification counseling to produce 5% weight loss over the&#xD;
      same timeframe. The primary outcome of weight loss will be assessed at 12 months.&#xD;

    <description>Participants randomized to the HIWL treatment group will be placed on a meal replacement-based weight loss protocol. Participants will consume a minimum of 80 grams of protein daily in 4-5 servings of meal replacement. Participants will begin to incorporate food into their routine beginning at week 13 with guidance from a dietitian. From weeks 13-24, caloric prescriptions will be between 1100 to 1600 calories a day, using a combination of meal replacements and food, for continued weight loss. Beyond week 25, caloric intake will be individually tailored to achieve continued gradual weight loss or maintenance of body weight based on individual weight loss goals. We will recommend continued use of at least 1 serving of meal replacement per day for maintenance of weight loss.</description>

    <description>The DSME intervention will be administered and delivered at the Wake Forest Baptist Health Diabetes Center, located next to the Weight Management Center, by a team of certified diabetes educators, nurses, and nutritionists in group and individual settings.&#xD;
The diabetes education program is accredited by the American Diabetes Association in recognition of meeting national standards for diabetes self-management education. The goal of the program is to provide participants with information to make informed decisions about how to best integrate diabetes management strategies into their daily lives. Assessment, planning, implementation, and evaluation are the basic components of the diabetes education process.</description>

In addition, the participants in this arm will receive a supply of continuous glucose monitors to use throughout the trial. The CGM we provide will give the patient instant feedback on blood glucose levels and be readable using a mobile phone device or an associated CGM reader. The data from the CGM will be integrated into the Carium app and used to help guide the patient's actions based on defined care pathways.</description>
