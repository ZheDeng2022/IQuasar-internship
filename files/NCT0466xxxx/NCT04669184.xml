  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many systems such as the cardiovascular, pulmonary, musculoskeletal, hematological,&#xD;
      immunological, gastrointestinal, central nervous system are affected due to decreased kidney&#xD;
      function. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between physical&#xD;
      performance and sarcopenia, peripheral muscle strength, activities of daily living, cognitive&#xD;
      functions, physical activity level, fragility, pain in hemodialysis patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A high prevalence of sarcopenia has been reported in end stage kidney disease. The incidence&#xD;
      of sarcopenia increases with age. Muscle atrophy is caused by an imbalance between the&#xD;
      anabolic and catabolic processes in chronic kidney disease. Sarcopenia and physical&#xD;
      inactivity progress synergistically. Decreased physical performance is associated with&#xD;
      sarcopenia. In hemodialysis patients, daily physical activity level and physical performance&#xD;
      decrease. Cognitive impairment is common in chronic kidney disease. Uremic toxins can cause a&#xD;
      decrease in cognitive function. One of the most important problems associated with&#xD;
      hemodialysis is pain and pain negatively affects functional capacity and quality of life.&#xD;

    <measure>Sarcopenia</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Sarcopenia will be evaluated using SARC-F questionnaire. For SARC-F, a total score of ≥ 4 indicates sarcopenia.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical performance will be evaluated using Short physical performance battery.</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The total score of Short physical performance battery ranges from 0 to 12.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical performance will be evaluated using 1 minute sit to stand test.</measure>

    <measure>Peripheral muscle strength</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Knee extensor and hand grip strength will be evaluated using dynamometer.</description>

    <measure>Cognitive function</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Cognitive function will be evaluated using Standardized Mini-Mental State Examination. The test is a 30-point screening tool. Higher scores mean a better outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical activity level</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Physical activity level will be evaluated using International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fragility</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Fragility will be evaluated using the five Fried frailty criteria (unintentional weight loss, exhaustion, weakness, slowness, low physical activity). The total score is interpreted as follows: 0 non-frail, 1-2 pre-frail and 3-5 frail</description>

    <measure>Activities of daily living</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Activities of daily living will be evaluated using Barthel Index for Activities of Daily Living.The total score is100 and higher scores mean a better outcome.</description>
