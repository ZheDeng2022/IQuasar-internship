&#xD;
             -  Topotecan&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cyclophosphamide&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The names of the non-investigational supportive care drugs are:&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label, single arm, phase 1 clinical trial. A single cohort of&#xD;
      patients with relapsed or refractory Ewing sarcoma or osteosarcoma will be enrolled and&#xD;
      treated in a 3+3 design with a combination of cabozantinib, topotecan and cyclophosphamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including&#xD;
      medical tests and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The names of the drugs are:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cabozantinib&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Topotecan&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cyclophosphamide&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The names of the non-investigational supportive care drugs are:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Filgrastim, pegfilgrastim, or a related growth factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that up to 16 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational&#xD;
      drug combination and also tries to define the appropriate doses of the drugs to use for&#xD;
      further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug combination is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved all medications included in this&#xD;
      trial as a treatment for multiple types of cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of topotecan and cyclophosphamide has been used for treatment of this&#xD;
      population. Cabozantinib has been used alone for treatment of Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma&#xD;
      and shown to have an effect in some patients. This is the first time that cabozantinib will&#xD;
      be studied in combination with topotecan and cyclophosphamide.&#xD;

    <description>Combination of cabozantinib with cyclophosphamide and topotecan&#xD;
If no Dose Limiting Toxicities occur during the first cycle for all three subjects, dose escalation to the next highest dose level will occur for the next three enrolling patients.&#xD;
If one out of three patients experience a DLT during the first cycle of therapy, up to three additional subjects will then be enrolled at the same dose level for a total of six patients at this dose level. If two or more patients experience DLTs in the 1st cycle, the trial will stop enrollment and this dose level will be the MAD.&#xD;
Up to six additional patients will be enrolled at the dose level below the MAD, with the MTD being established once ≤1 patient in a dose level experiences DLTs.&#xD;
If two out of three patients experience DLTs during the 1st cycle, the protocol will halt enrollment at this dose level, which will be considered the MAD.</description>

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The CTCAE version 5.0 of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) for toxicity and performance reporting. Tabulations will be generated by toxicity type and grade, counting only the maximum grade per type within a given patient. Serious adverse events will be separately tabulated.

    <measure>Objective Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The objective response rate to cabozantinib, topotecan and cyclophosphamide will be calculated as follows: (# responders) / (# of patients in the response analysis population) * 100%. A 95% exact two-sided confidence interval will be placed on this proportion. In addition, the number and proportion of patients by level of response will be presented. Patients with an overall best objective response of partial response or complete response prior to local measures will be categorized as responders, and all other patients as non-responders. This analysis will be conducted within the response analysis population.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 6 years and ≤ 30 years at time of enrollment. Note the requirement to swallow&#xD;
             intact pills and BSA requirement immediately following.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  BSA ≥1.25m2 and &lt;2m2 is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with BSA &lt; 1.25m2 are not eligible for enrollment due to percent&#xD;
                  deviation of daily cabozantinib dose being too extreme as a result of limitations&#xD;
                  in the size of dose forms available.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with BSA &gt;2m2 are not eligible for enrollment due to inability to&#xD;
                  provide sufficient dose escalation and de-escalation for cabozantinib due to&#xD;
                  restraints imposed by dose of individual pills.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Karnofsky performance status ≥ 50% for patients ≥16 years of age and Lansky ≥ 50% for&#xD;
             patients &lt;16 years of age&#xD;

                  Diagnosis of low-grade osteosarcoma (LGOS) and parosteal osteosarcoma (POS) are&#xD;

                  FISH, RT-PCR, or next generation sequencing. If the translocation partner is&#xD;
                  known, it must be of the ETS family (e.g.. FLI1 or ERG). For patients referred to&#xD;
                  the study center from outside institutions, the local institutional analysis of&#xD;
                  prior tumor material may serve to fulfill this requirement.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have fully recovered (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events&#xD;
             [CTCAE] version 5 Grade ≤1) from the acute toxic effects of all prior anti-cancer&#xD;

             periods prior to enrollment:&#xD;

                  the combination of topotecan and cyclophosphamide must meet these additional&#xD;

&#xD;
                    -  If topotecan/cyclophosphamide is the regimen immediately preceding&#xD;

&#xD;
                  --- For agents with known adverse events occurring beyond 7 days, this duration&#xD;
                  must be extended beyond the time in which adverse events are known to occur and&#xD;
                  this should be discussed and approved by the overall PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
