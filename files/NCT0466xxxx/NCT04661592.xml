  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The NeuroCatch Platform™ version 2.0 (NCP2.0), an investigational medical device system&#xD;
      developed by NeuroCatch Inc., consists of software and hardware that captures brain health&#xD;
      information. The platform intends to provide a quick, portable and easy to use solution for&#xD;
      the acquisition, display, analysis, storage, reporting and management of&#xD;
      electroencephalograph (EEG) and event-related potential (ERP; brain response to a stimulus)&#xD;
      information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to understand how reliable and repeatable the ERP metrics&#xD;
      elicited by the NCP platform are within participants over multiple sessions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A new method for creating stimulus sequences was developed for NeuroCatch™ Platform 2.0.&#xD;
      Rather than using a set of fixed, predetermined sequences to elicit ERPs this new method&#xD;
      draws on a database of candidate word stimuli to generate a different, random stimulus&#xD;
      sequence each time a scan is carried out. The goal of this is to reduce habituation to the&#xD;
      stimulus sequences which is hypothesized to improve the repeatability of the component&#xD;
      measurements. Characterizing how individuals respond to the stimulus sequences is an&#xD;
      important step in the validation of the generation method itself. Understanding the degree of&#xD;
      variability and prototypical values of each ERP component is crucial to the understanding of&#xD;
      typical brain functioning. For this type of technology to be clinically viable in quantifying&#xD;
      brain health, the investigators must first quantify the degree to which a healthy brain&#xD;
      naturally fluctuates in it processing capability. This study is being carried out to assess&#xD;
      how repeatable the ERPs elicited by the new method are while also considering the impact of&#xD;
      intraindividual variability observed in previous investigations. Thus, by comparing the&#xD;
      results of the scans over time, an assessment of the reliability of the new stimulus&#xD;
      sequences can be made.&#xD;
