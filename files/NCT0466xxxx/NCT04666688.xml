      A Phase 1/2 Open-label, Multi-center Study of the Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Anti-tumor&#xD;
      Activity of LYT-200 Alone and in Combination with Chemotherapy or Anti-PD-1 in Patients with&#xD;
      Metastatic Solid Tumors&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, uncontrolled, multicenter Phase 1/2 study with a dose escalation phase&#xD;
      (Part 1) and a cohort expansion phase (Part 2) in patients with relapsed/refractory&#xD;
      metastatic solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: Dose Escalation Phase A dose-finding study will be conducted using a continuous&#xD;
      reassessment method (CRM) to establish dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and the recommended&#xD;
      Phase 2 dose (RP2D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: Cohort Expansion Phase The second part of the protocol will adopt a Simon's two-stage&#xD;
      optimal design. The Sponsor plans expansion cohorts for specific solid tumors, eg, pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer, cholangiocarcinoma and/or potentially other solid tumor types based on results from&#xD;
      part 1.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Part 1 and Part 2&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Written Informed Consent (mentally competent patient, able to understand and&#xD;
                  willing to sign the informed consent form)&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Age ≥ 18 years, male or non-pregnant female&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Histologically confirmed unresectable metastatic cancer (adenocarcinomas and&#xD;
                  squamous cell carcinomas allowed). Patients with resectable disease are excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Able to comply with the study protocol, as per Investigator's judgment&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Life expectancy &gt; 3 months according to Investigator's judgement&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) negative patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
               8. Patient able and willing to undergo pre- and on/post-treatment biopsies.&#xD;
                  According to the Investigator's judgement, the planned biopsies should not expose&#xD;
                  the patient to substantially increased risk of complications. Every effort will&#xD;
                  be made that the same lesion is biopsied on repeat biopsies. If the patient is&#xD;
                  eligible according to all other criteria but declines to consent to a biopsy or&#xD;
                  there are other medical reasons precluding biopsy, this will be discussed with&#xD;
                  the sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
               9. Measurable disease, according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors&#xD;
                  (RECIST) v1.1. Note that lesions intended to be biopsied should not be target&#xD;
                  lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
              10. Adequate hematologic and end organ function, defined by the following laboratory&#xD;

&#xD;
                    1. neutrophil count ≥ 1 x 109/L&#xD;
&#xD;
                    2. platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L; for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Part 1 ≥&#xD;

&#xD;
                    5. aspartate aminotransferase AST (SGOT) ≤ 3 x ULN (≤ 5 x ULN when HCC or&#xD;

&#xD;
                    6. alanine aminotransferase (ALT [SGPT]) ≤ 3 x ULN (≤ 5 x ULN when HCC or&#xD;
                       hepatic metastases present)&#xD;
&#xD;
                    7. bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN (patients with known Gilbert's disease may have a&#xD;
                       bilirubin ≤ 3.0 x ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
                    8. albumin ≥ 3.0 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
                    9. international normalized ratio (INR) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) ≤&#xD;
                       1.5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
                   10. amylase and lipase ≤ 1.5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
              11. No evidence of active infection or infections requiring parenteral antibiotics,&#xD;
                  and no serious infection within 4 weeks before study start.&#xD;
&#xD;
              12. Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 72 h&#xD;
                  prior to start of treatment. For women of childbearing potential: agreement to&#xD;
                  remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or to use contraceptive&#xD;
                  methods that result in a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year during the treatment&#xD;
                  period and for at least 180 days after the last study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  A woman is of childbearing potential if she is post-menarche, has not reached a&#xD;
                  postmenopausal state (≥ 12 continuous months of amenorrhea with no identified&#xD;
                  cause other than menopause), and has not undergone surgical sterilization&#xD;
                  (removal of ovaries and/or uterus).&#xD;
&#xD;
                  Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year include&#xD;
                  bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormonal contraceptives that&#xD;
                  inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing intrauterine devices and copper intrauterine&#xD;
                  devices. The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to&#xD;
                  the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the&#xD;
                  patient. Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptom-thermal, or post&#xD;
                  ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.&#xD;
                  Fertile men must practice effective contraceptive methods during the study,&#xD;
                  unless documentation of infertility exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
              13. Four (4) weeks or 5 half-lives (whichever is shorter) since the last dose of&#xD;
                  anti-cancer therapy before the first LYT 200 administration&#xD;

              14. Continuation of bisphosphonate treatment (eg, zoledronic acid) or denosumab for&#xD;
                  bone metastases, which have been stable for at least 6 months before C1D1, is&#xD;
                  allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
              15. Biliary or gastric outlet obstruction allowed, provided it is effectively drained&#xD;
                  by endoscopic, operative, or interventional means&#xD;
&#xD;
              16. Pancreatic, biliary, or enteric fistulae allowed, provided they are controlled&#xD;
                  with an appropriate non-infected and patent drain (if any drains or stents are in&#xD;
                  situ, patency needs to be confirmed before study start)&#xD;
&#xD;
                  Additionally, for Part 1 only:&#xD;
&#xD;
              17. Patients:&#xD;

                  adjuvant/locally advanced setting&#xD;
&#xD;
              19. CRC and CCA expansion cohorts - patients who have received at least one prior&#xD;
                  line of therapy in the metastatic setting&#xD;
