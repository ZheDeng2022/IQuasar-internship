    <textblock>
      The Cold Stored Platelet Early Intervention in Hemorrhagic Shock (CriSP-HS) trial is a&#xD;
      proposed 3 year, open label, multi-center, randomized trial designed to determine the&#xD;
      feasibility, efficacy, and safety of urgent release cold stored platelets (CSP) in patients&#xD;
      in hemorrhagic shock. Patients will be randomized to receive either standard care or early&#xD;
      infusion of urgent release cold stored platelets (CSP). The proposed pilot study will utilize&#xD;
      5 level-1 trauma centers from within the LITES network and will enroll approximately 200&#xD;
      patients. The primary outcome for the pilot trial is feasibility, with principal secondary&#xD;
      clinical outcome of 24 hour mortality.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The acute management of the severely injured patient with hemorrhage following trauma center&#xD;
      arrival has evolved over the last decade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current treatment priorities include prevention of coagulopathy through minimization of&#xD;
      crystalloid and early blood component resuscitation including plasma and platelets in equal&#xD;
      ratios with packed red blood cells. These in-hospital practices, termed damage control&#xD;
      resuscitation, are widely used in both battlefield and civilian resuscitation following&#xD;
      traumatic injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initiation of the tenets of damage control resuscitation early, soon after arrival, has the&#xD;
      potential to reduce downstream complications attributable to hemorrhage by intervening closer&#xD;
      to the time of injury, prior to the development of coagulopathy; irreversible shock; and the&#xD;
      ensuing inflammatory response. Other blood constituents have recently been shown to be&#xD;
      beneficial when given early. Thawed plasma transfusion has been shown to safely reduce 30-day&#xD;
      mortality when infused early, in the prehospital setting, in patients at risk of hemorrhagic&#xD;
      shock and this separation of survival occurs within the first 3 hours. Platelet transfusion&#xD;
      is associated with improved outcomes in the acutely bleeding patients. Cold Stored Platelets&#xD;
      have been reported to reduce blood loss when provided for hemorrhage and are a more effective&#xD;
      hemostatic product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cold stored platelets are less likely to become bacterial contaminated and were the standard&#xD;
      of care platelet product until the 1980s. Despite this history and potential benefits, the&#xD;
      risks associated with urgent release cold stored platelets and their respective efficacy and&#xD;
      function over time are not known in patients with hemorrhagic shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By providing Cold Stored Platelets in an urgent release fashion following injury, a&#xD;
      potentially superior hemostatic agent is given early, closer to the time of injury. The&#xD;
      current pilot trial was designed to determine the feasibility, efficacy and safety of urgent&#xD;
      release cold stored platelets as compared to standard care in injured patients in hemorrhagic&#xD;
      shock. There are no high-level data which appropriately characterize the urgent release use&#xD;
      of cold stored platelets out to 14 days or their function over that time period as compared&#xD;
      to standard room temperature platelets. These results will be able to inform future large&#xD;
      randomized clinical trials allowing the most appropriate injured population, inclusion&#xD;
      criteria, and primary outcome to be selected and utilized.&#xD;
