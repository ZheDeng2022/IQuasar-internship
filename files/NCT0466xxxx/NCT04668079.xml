    <textblock>
      The aim of this research is to compare the effect of modified cross body stretch and modified&#xD;
      sleeper stretch on pain, range of motion, disability and throwing ability in athletes with&#xD;
      posterior capsule tightness. Randomized controlled trials done at International Islamic&#xD;
      University. The sample size was 32. The subjects were divided in two groups, 16 subjects in&#xD;
      modified cross body stretch group and 16 in modified sleeper stretch group. Study duration&#xD;
      was of 6 months. Sampling technique applied was non probability connivance sampling&#xD;
      technique. Tools used in the study are PENN shoulder score, gonoiometer, thumb up back(TUB)&#xD;
      and seated basketball throw test(SBBT). Data was be analyzed through SPSS 21.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Basketball is considered as the highly demanding sports due to high demand and complexity of&#xD;
      the game. The overhead throwing activities makes it more vulnerable to the injuries. In&#xD;
      repetitive throwing there are different type of violet forces placed on shoulder joint It&#xD;
      causes adaptation in soft tissue anatomically which in turn limits ROM of shoulder joint and&#xD;
      Posterior shoulder tightness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Posterior capsule tightness can result due to abnormal humeral head motion which decreases&#xD;
      subacromial space during overhead activities leading to compression of tissues causing&#xD;
      limited shoulder flexion, internal rotation and horizontal adduction. Posterior capsule&#xD;
      tightening occurs when the capsular tissue and musculature of the shoulder tighten, usually&#xD;
      due to &quot;repeated overload in the eccentric portion of arm deceleration. This loss of internal&#xD;
      rotation results from contracture and tightening of the posterior inferior portion of the&#xD;
      glenohumeral joint capsule, which occurs from the repetitive microtrauma imparted during the&#xD;
      deceleration phase of the throwing motion. Repetitive throwing motion creates adaptive&#xD;
      increased external rotation and decreased internal rotation in the dominant shoulder joint&#xD;
      which is termed as GIRD (Glenohumeral internal rotation deficit).Posterior capsule tightness&#xD;
      is often treated without surgery. It can be treated by strengthening, stretching,&#xD;
      neuromuscular control exercises. Strengthening protocol can perform specifically on Weak&#xD;
      muscles by using resistance and weight. The neuromuscular training helps the body to act and&#xD;
      react on different pattern of stress demand on it through neural pathways. The mainstay of&#xD;
      the posterior capsule tightness treatment for athlete is the stretching of the posterior&#xD;
      capsule. One author proposed the modified forms, the modified sleeper stretch and the&#xD;
      modified cross body stretch. And found these modified stretching more effective and&#xD;
      beneficial than the sleeper and cross body stretch Literature review: Kevin et al&#xD;
      investigated the acute effects of sleeper stretch on posterior shoulder tightness and&#xD;
      internal rotation of shoulder. There was significant improvement in results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study conducted in 2018 to determine whether posterior shoulder stretch was effective in&#xD;
      increasing internal rotation and horizontal adduction ROM in volleyball and tennis players&#xD;
      with internal rotation deficit &gt;¬¬15 degrees. The intervention group performs the sleeper&#xD;
      stretch daily for 8 weeks. Results showed significant improvement in internal rotation and&#xD;
      horizontal adduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another article was published in 2014, with the aim to compare the effects of horizontal&#xD;
      adduction stretch with scapular stabilization versus horizontal adduction stretch without&#xD;
      scapular stabilization on posterior shoulder tightness and passive internal rotation. Results&#xD;
      showed significant improvement among the scapular stabilization group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A RCT conducted in which each subject completed stretching interventions for two days.&#xD;
      Purpose of the study was to investigate acute effects of modified sleeper stretch and&#xD;
      modified cross body stretch on posterior shoulder tightness and glenohumral internal rotation&#xD;
      deficit with more than 10-degree loss.&#xD;

    <description>The disability of shoulder conditions was measured by Penn score. Which consists of 3 categories i.e.; pain, satisfaction and functional ability. Pain consists of 3 questionnaires that consists of 10 scores each (total 30) and then satisfaction, it consists of 1 questionnaire consists of 10 scores, functional ability consists of 20 questionnaires with 10 scores each for the questionnaire (total 60)</description>
