  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to improve medication, symptom, and disease management of&#xD;
      patients with hematological malignancies and multiple chronic conditions (2 or more&#xD;
      conditions in addition to cancer) through care coordination between pharmacists working in&#xD;
      oncology practices and those working in primary care or community practices (Pharmacists&#xD;
      Coordinated care Oncology Model [PCOM]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot study in which the investigators will examine the association between outcome&#xD;
      measures, but the study design and sample size are insufficient to quantify the impact of OAA&#xD;
      initiation or OAA adherence on adherence to chronic medications. This pilot study and data&#xD;
      analyses are being done in preparation for a larger, controlled study.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Oral anticancer agent adherence by proportion of days covered (PDC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months post-initiation</time_frame>
    <description>PDC is a common medication adherence metric, and assesses the ratio of number of days the patient is supplied with oral anticancer agent, from the time of initiation until 6 months later, to the total number of days during that period. Data from the electronic medical record for dose changes will be aligned with the refill data to calculate a dose-adjusted PDC.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Chronic disease medication adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months pre- and post-initiation of the oral anticancer agent</time_frame>
    <description>PDCs for medications for select chronic diseases will be calculated for the 6 months before and after oral anticancer agent initiation</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient-reported outcome measure completion</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 42 days after oral anticancer agent initiation</time_frame>
    <description>The oncology-specific patient-reported outcome measure is to be completed at 2 and 6 weeks after oral anticancer agent initiation. This measure assesses the percent of patients who complete this tool at both time points.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comprehensive Medication Review (CMR) completion</measure>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Oncology pharmacist review of patient-reported outcome measure</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 44 days after oral anticancer agent initiation</time_frame>
    <description>The patient-reported outcome measure is scored within one day after it is completed by the subject and is routed to the oncology pharmacist to review the results. The number of measures that are reviewed within 1 day of receipt will be assessed at 2 weeks and at 6 weeks.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent of Comprehensive Medication Reviews (CMRs) where note was routed to oncology pharmacist</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 43 days after oral anticancer agent initiation</time_frame>
