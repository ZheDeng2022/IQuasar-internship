  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the nephroprotective potential of treatment with sparsentan in patients&#xD;
      newly-diagnosed with immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) (ie, incident patients) who have not&#xD;
      received prior angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blocker&#xD;
      (ARB) therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single centre, open-label, single-group study to explore the safety of, and&#xD;
      response to sparsentan treatment in incident, renin angiotensin system (RAS) blockade-naïve&#xD;
      patients with biopsy-proven immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN). The purpose is to explore&#xD;
      sparsentan treatment as a potential first-line treatment in patients newly diagnosed with&#xD;
      IgAN (ie, incident patients), who have thus not received prior treatment with ACEI or ARB&#xD;
      therapy for IgAN. Response to treatment will be assessed as changes from baseline rather than&#xD;
      comparison to another treatment, and will be based on established proteinuria endpoints (UPCR&#xD;
      and protein excretion), and glomerular filtration rate (GFR); a number of exploratory&#xD;
      measures will be assessed as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The starting dose of sparsentan will be 200 mg/day, which will be titrated up to the target&#xD;
      dose of 400 mg/day at Week 2. Patients who do not tolerate the target dose will have their&#xD;
      dose reduced back to 200 or 100 mg/day; throughout the study, patients will be maintained on&#xD;
      the maximum allowed dose of sparsentan they can tolerate. All patients will be treated with&#xD;
      sparsentan for a total of 110 weeks, followed by an off-treatment follow-up period of 4&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
