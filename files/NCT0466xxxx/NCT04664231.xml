  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA)is the most common chronic rheumatic disease in childhood.&#xD;
      While JIA usually affects the ankle and knee joints, it can also affect hip, cervical spine&#xD;
      and shoulder involvement. Secondary problems such as spine involvement or lack of weight&#xD;
      transfer may lead to scoliosis. The aim of this study was to perform scoliosis screening in&#xD;
      children with JIA and to evaluate families' awareness of scoliosis.&#xD;

      Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA)is the most common chronic rheumatic disease in childhood.&#xD;
      While JIA usually affects the ankle and knee joints, it can also affect hip, cervical spine&#xD;
      and shoulder involvement. Secondary problems such as spine involvement or lack of weight&#xD;
      transfer may lead to scoliosis. The aim of this study was to perform scoliosis screening in&#xD;
      children with JIA and to evaluate families' awareness of scoliosis. aged 4-16 years will&#xD;
      include in the study. Trunk rotation measure with scoliometer by applying forward bending&#xD;
      test. Children with more than 5 rotations will send to the X-ray. 28 questions will asked,&#xD;
      which evaluate the demographic characteristics of children, their educational status, their&#xD;
      participation in sports activities, and the physical appearance of families about their&#xD;
      children. These questions will asked if the parents had heard of scoliosis before, where they&#xD;
      heard it, and whether anyone had scoliosis in the family. Families who complained of posture&#xD;
      disorder will asked which shoulder is high without looking at their children and whether they&#xD;
      see any height when they leaned forward and the pain situation in their children. Statistical&#xD;
      analysis of the data using the SPSS 24.0 (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) program.&#xD;
      In all analyzes, p≤0.05 consider statistically significant.&#xD;

    <measure>Assesment of angle of trunk rotation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Angle of trunk rotation (ATR) will be evaluated with Scoliometer.It is an easy-to-use, reliable, practical specially designed inclinometer for scoliometer. The evaluation will be done with Adam's Bend test, in the standing forward bending position. Child's feet will be positioned parallel to each other. The physiotherapist who measures to adjust the distance between the feet, by placing one foot between the two feet of the child, by moving the scoliometer from the beginning of the thoracic to the sacrum, the largest measured angle of rotation will be recorded.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Radiological imaging</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Radiological imaging shows vertebrae' lateral tilt degree. It calculated with Cobb angle method. The Cobb angle provides information about the degree of scoliosis.i It is accepted as a clinical evaluation method used in giving information about scoliosis and determining the effectiveness of treatment and prognosis of scoliosis.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient awareness forms</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>It will be created to obtain sociodemographic information and personal data about the disease. In this context, gender, age, height, weight, occupation, educational status, dominant side, affected side (s) and patient history, disease duration, time spend at the desk and sports activity will be questioned in detail. For family Scoliosis Awareness, Have you heard of scoliosis?, Is there a family?, Are the child's shoulder heights equal? (Say without looking), Which one is high? When you bend forward, do you see an asymmetry on the back?, Is there any pain? questions will ask</description>
