  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, double-blind, multicentre study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, PK,&#xD;
      PD, and immunogenicity of SB16 compared to Prolia® in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.&#xD;

      Subjects will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either SB16 or Prolia®. At Month 12,&#xD;
      subjects in Prolia® treatment group will be randomised again in a 1:1 ratio to either&#xD;
      continue on Prolia® treatment or be transitioned to SB16 treatment. Investigational product&#xD;
      (60 mg in 1 mL of SB16 or Prolia®) will be given subcutaneously every 6 months up to Month&#xD;
      12, and the last assessment will be done at Month 18.&#xD;
