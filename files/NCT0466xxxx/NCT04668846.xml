  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This sample collection study will recruit subjects with a variety of skin conditions from up&#xD;
      to 15 geographically dispersed sites in the United States. Skin samples will be collected&#xD;
      with the DermTech Adhesive Patch Kit from both lesional and non-lesional skin. Subjects may&#xD;
      also be asked to return at a future data for additional collections. Collected skin samples&#xD;
      will be analyzed for gene expression information, DNA and the microbiome.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, sample collection study to obtain skin tissue for gene expression,&#xD;
      DNA mutation, microbiome and related analyses from subjects with dermatologic conditions.&#xD;
      After subjects are consented for the study, site staff will collect skin tissue from the&#xD;
      subject using DermTech's non-invasive skin collection kit. Skin samples will be collected&#xD;
      from both lesional and non-lesional skin as applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional skin tissue may be collected from the lesion and non-lesional area with the&#xD;
      DermTech non-invasive skin collection kit at a later time point as directed by DermTech to&#xD;
      track the dermatologic condition for progression, improvements or lack of response to&#xD;
      standard of care therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each Dermtech non-invasive skin collection kit will consist of the sequential application of&#xD;
      up to 24 individual patches to lesional and non-lesional areas. Sites should apply the&#xD;
      DermTech patches to the most severe lesion(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dermatologic conditions include but are not limited too; atopic dermatitis, atopic asthma,&#xD;
      skin cancers (i.e., basal, and squamous carcinoma, melanoma, etc.), lupus, rheumatoid and&#xD;
      psoriatic arthritis, gutate and plaque psoriasis, palmoplantar psoriasis, palmoplantar&#xD;
      contact dermatitis, fungal infections and cutaneous T cell Lymphoma. Skin tissue will be&#xD;
      collected using DermTech's proprietary adhesive patch skin biopsy kit and extracted for&#xD;
      analysis at DermTech's CLIA and CAP Laboratory. Analysis of the samples will include gene&#xD;
      expression signatures and DNA mutation as well as microbiome analyses associated with the&#xD;
      medical conditions of interest.&#xD;
