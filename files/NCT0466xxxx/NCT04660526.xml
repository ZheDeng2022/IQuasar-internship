      RACE-CARS is a real-world cluster-randomized trial designed to evaluate a multifaceted&#xD;
      community and health systems intervention aimed to improve outcomes of out-of-hospital&#xD;
      cardiac arrest. RACE-CARS will enroll 50 counties in North Carolina that are estimated to&#xD;
      have a total of approximately 20,000 patients with cardiac arrest over a 4-year intervention&#xD;
      period. County &quot;clusters&quot; will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to intervention versus usual&#xD;
      care. The trial duration is 7 years, which includes a 6-month start-up (including recruitment&#xD;
      and randomization) period, a 12-month intervention training phase, a 4-year intervention&#xD;
      period, a 12-month follow-up for to assess quality of life in survivors of OHCA, and a&#xD;
      6-month close-out and data analysis period.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  OHCA of non-traumatic etiology&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are pulseless on arrival of a first responder; or patients who become&#xD;
             pulseless in the presence of a first responder; OR patients who have a pulse on&#xD;
             arrival of EMS, where a successful defibrillation was previously administered by a&#xD;
             bystander or first responder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Untreated cardiac arrests, including arrests in which resuscitation efforts are not&#xD;
             initiated or are terminated immediately upon arrival of EMS because the patient is not&#xD;
             a viable candidate for resuscitation due to:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. injuries incompatible with life,&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. the presence of rigor mortis or lividity,&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. signs of decomposition, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. the presence of a valid DNR.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Private EMS transport that did not involve 911 dispatch (example: interfacility&#xD;
             transport between nursing home and hospital).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Arrest of clear and obvious traumatic etiology&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bystander suspected cardiac arrest, where ROSC was achieved without the need for&#xD;
             defibrillation or first responder CPR&#xD;
