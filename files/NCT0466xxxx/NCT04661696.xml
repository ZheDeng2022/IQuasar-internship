  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epithelial ovarian cancer is the most fatal gynecological malignancy. Despite initial&#xD;
      therapeutic response, the majority of advanced-stage patients relapse and eventually succumb&#xD;
      to chemoresistant disease. The majority of ovarian cancer patients with standardized&#xD;
      treatment, including tumor cell reduction and postoperatively platinum-based combination&#xD;
      chemotherapy, will still experience tumor recurrence and multiple recurrences within 6-18&#xD;
      months.With the increase in the number of recurrences, the intertherapeutic period will&#xD;
      shorten and eventually drug resistance will emerge.The purpose of treatment for recurrent&#xD;
      ovarian cancer is mainly to improve the quality of life of patients and prolong survival.&#xD;
      CSPC OUYI PHARMACEUTICAL CO., LTD has successfully developed Paclitaxel (Albumin-Bound) and&#xD;
      the bioequivalence test results show good consistency with Abraxane.To evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of Paclitaxel (Albumin-Bound) combination with carboplatin in Chinese patients&#xD;
      with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer, this clinical study is planned.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter, open, single arm, phase 2 clinical study in patients with&#xD;
      platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer.75 patients were planned to be enrolled, and the&#xD;
      eligible patients were given the following regimen: Paclitaxel (Albumin-Bound) 130 mg/m^2,&#xD;
      i.v., d1, d8;Carboplatin AUC 5, i.v.,d1;Every 21 days is a cycle, a total of 6 cycles.This&#xD;
      study will be divided into three stages.The baseline period:Patients will complete screening&#xD;
      tests at baseline to assess eligibility for inclusion criteria.Treatment period:(from the&#xD;
      first dose to the last treatment cycle).Imaging tumor assessment was performed every 2 cycles&#xD;
      (i.e. 6 weeks).Follow-up period:At the end of the study, patients were followed up by&#xD;
      telephone or at the study center every 3 months to collect survival status and subsequent&#xD;
      antitumor treatment until death or loss of follow-up.&#xD;
