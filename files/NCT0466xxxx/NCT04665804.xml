  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common joint disorders, affecting not only the joints&#xD;
      but also the surrounding muscles, which become weak. Resistance exercise reduces pain and&#xD;
      improves function in patients with OA of the knee. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs&#xD;
      (NSAIDs) are widely used by patients with OA to reduce pain and thereby maintain the ability&#xD;
      to perform daily activities. However, there is accumulating evidence for a negative effect of&#xD;
      NSAIDs, thus many patients with OA are treated with dietary supplementations such as&#xD;
      glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, and some studies show a beneficial effects on cartilage&#xD;
      and pain. However, their effect on OA symptoms and cartilage remains controversial. On the&#xD;
      other hand creatine supplementation has also been observed to show promising effects when&#xD;
      combined with resistance training exercise in the elderly, but the evidence is limited in&#xD;
      terms of knee osteoarthritis. For this reason the purpose of this study is to determine the&#xD;
      effects of creatine supplementation as compared to glucosamine/chondroitin sulfate in the&#xD;
      management of knee osteoarthritis when combined with resistance training exercise.&#xD;
