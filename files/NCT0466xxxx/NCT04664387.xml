    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of physical and mental disorder&#xD;
      in the population of patients with myocardial bridge and to describe the relationship between&#xD;
      clinical features and the occurrence of somatic disorder.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Myocardial bridge (MB), a congenital cardiac anomaly, is an unignored contribution to chest&#xD;
      pain. Patients with MB often complain about chest discomfort more serious than the degree of&#xD;
      vessel compression. The symptoms are also often inconsistence with the degree of coronary&#xD;
      stenosis. Reports suggested that patients with MB may companioned with depression and&#xD;
      anxiety. Moreover, patients with MB often have other systemic complaints including stomach&#xD;
      pain, pain on the back, ear blockage, et al. Investigators assume that somatic symptom&#xD;
      disorder (SSD) may play a part in aggregating the severity of symptoms. In order to screen&#xD;
      SSD, investigators previously developed the Somatic Symptom Scale-China (SSS-CN)&#xD;
      questionnaire. It is a somatic and psychological symptom scale which was developed based on&#xD;
      the DSM-5 to assess a combination of psychological, behavioral and somatic symptoms. It is&#xD;
      designed to assess the presence and severity of the symptoms. Investigators have validated&#xD;
      its reliability and validity in a previous study. The purpose of this study was to&#xD;
      investigate the prevalence of physical and mental disorder in the population of patients with&#xD;
      MB and to describe the relationship between clinical features and the occurrence of somatic&#xD;
      disorder.&#xD;

    <description>to compare the score of Somatic Symptom Scale-China questionnaire between patients with and without myocardial bridge. SSS-CN is a self-administered questionnaire with 20 items and scoring 1, 2, 3, 4 to each item. The total score is from 20 to 80. The higher the score is, the higher frequency that the symptoms presented.</description>
