      Problem description: low compliance with iron supplementation of Saudi pregnant women with&#xD;
      anemia is a serious public health concern. The objectives of the study are to determine the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the Health Information Package Program (HIP program) in Saudi anemic&#xD;
      pregnant women on their compliance with iron supplementation, and level of hemoglobin.&#xD;
      Methodology: Randomized Controlled Trial will be conducted on 196 Saudi anemic pregnant women&#xD;
      attending the Maternity and Children Hospital in Saudi Arabia their gestational age between&#xD;
      14 and less than 20 weeks. All participants will receive iron supplementation and they will&#xD;
      learn how to take tablets. They will randomly assign to two intervention and control groups&#xD;
      (98 each) using a computer-generated table of random numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group will receive a PowerPoint presentation of the Health Information&#xD;
      Package Program (HIP program) that will be introduced by the principal investigator, combined&#xD;
      with PowerPoint slides to educate women about anemia in pregnancy and send it to them via&#xD;
      Whatsapp application while the control group will receive usual care. The participants will&#xD;
      be informed about the nature and aim of the study with assuring confidentiality and&#xD;
      anonymity. Expected outcome: Health Information Package Program (HIP program) will be&#xD;
      effective in terms of increasing women's knowledge regarding anemia during pregnancy,&#xD;
      increase compliance with iron supplementation, and hemoglobin level.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims to assess the efficacy of the Health information package program (HIP&#xD;
      program) on compliance with iron supplementation pills, and the level of hemoglobin among&#xD;
      Saudi pregnant women with anemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in antenatal outpatient clinics at primary health care centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection tools&#xD;
&#xD;
      I- Demographic and health-related information included data related to women's age, marriage&#xD;
      age, level of education, gestational age, parity, body mass index, inter-pregnancy interval,&#xD;
      history of excessive or abnormal bleeding during menstruation, and level of hemoglobin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II- compliance with iron supplementation included questions related to the extent of&#xD;
      compliance with iron supplementation among anemic pregnant women and the reason for&#xD;
      compliance or non-compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III- The food selection ability checklist contained food items that are rich and poor sources&#xD;
      of iron, vitamin C, and protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV- Structured Knowledge Interview Schedule (SKIS): This tool was developed to assess women&#xD;
      information before and after the intervention, it contained questions regarding the concept&#xD;
      of pregnancy, anemia in pregnancy, causes of iron deficiency anemia, signs and symptoms, the&#xD;
      effect of anemia on pregnancy, prevention, and management of iron deficiency anemia. Each&#xD;
      correct answer is assigned one point. The maximum number of total possible points was 86.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Random assignment will use to classify the participants equally (98 women each) either in the&#xD;
      intervention or control groups using a computer-generated table of random numbers.&#xD;

The principal investigator will narrate the video record with PowerPoint slides and it was recorded as a video and will include information regarding the introduction to pregnancy, causes and predisposing factors of iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy, signs and symptoms, prevention, management of iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy that includes iron therapy, iron supplementation, dietary management. Content validity for the information in the video will be done by sending it to three experts in maternity nursing. Iron supplementation will be given to all participants who will start by sixteen weeks of pregnancy and they will receive information regarding the proper usage of iron supplements.</description>
