        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or female subjects (≥12 years of age) of non-childbearing or of childbearing&#xD;
             potential committed to consistent and correct use of an acceptable method of birth&#xD;
             control.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients diagnosed with asthma, as defined by the National Asthma Education and&#xD;
             Prevention Program (NAEPP), at least 12 weeks months prior to screening (Visit 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Pre-bronchodilator FEV1 of ≥45% and ≤85% of the predicted value (for age ≥18 years),&#xD;
             or ≥65% and ≤90% predicted normal value (for ages 12 to 17 years) during the screening&#xD;
             visit and on the first day of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Currently non-smoking; had not used tobacco products (i.e., cigarettes, cigars, pipe&#xD;
             tobacco) within the past year, and had ≤ 10 pack-years of historical use.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. ≥12% and 200 mL reversibility of FEV1 within 30 minutes following 400 mcg salbutamol&#xD;
             (4 puffs) inhalation (pMDI). This may be demonstrated at the Screening Visit or this&#xD;
             test may be repeated on a different day if the patient fails the first attempt anytime&#xD;
             in the period leading up to the day of randomization; If reversibility is not&#xD;
             demonstrated up to the day of randomization then patients may be permitted to enter&#xD;
             the study with historical evidence of reversibility that was performed within 2 years&#xD;
             prior to Screening visit (Visit 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients should be on stable doses of their chronic asthma treatment regimen and&#xD;
             should have well-controlled asthma for at least 4 weeks prior to enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients who are able to discontinue their asthma medications (inhaled corticosteroids&#xD;
             and long-acting β agonists) during the run-in period and for the remainder of the&#xD;
             study, according to investigator's judgement.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients who are able to replace current short-acting β agonists (SABAs) with&#xD;
             salbutamol inhaler for use as needed for the duration of the study (subjects should be&#xD;
             able to withhold all inhaled SABAs for at least 6 hours prior to lung function&#xD;
             assessments on study visits).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients who are able to continue treatment with theophylline or montelukast without a&#xD;
             significant adjustment of dosage, formulation, dosing interval for the duration of the&#xD;
             study, and judged able by the investigator to withhold them for the specified minimum&#xD;
             time intervals prior to each patient visit: 1) montelukast 36 hours 2) short-acting&#xD;
             forms of theophylline 12 hours, 3) twice-a-day controlled-release forms of&#xD;
             theophylline 24 hours, 4) once-a-day controlled-release forms of theophylline 36&#xD;
             hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients who are able to understand the requirements of the clinical trial and to&#xD;
             agree to return for the required follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Willing to provide voluntary written informed consent and data protection declaration&#xD;
             (and in the case of a minor their parent/guardian was able to give) before any&#xD;
             clinical trial related procedure is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Life-threatening asthma, defined as a history of asthma episode(s) requiring&#xD;
             intubation, and/or associated with hypercapnia; respiratory arrest or hypoxic&#xD;
             seizures, asthma related syncopal episode(s), or hospitalizations within the past&#xD;
             year.&#xD;
&#xD;

             chronic bronchitis, emphysema, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Evidence or history of clinically significant disease or abnormality including&#xD;
             congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled coronary artery&#xD;

             current evidence of significant hematologic, hepatic neurologic, psychiatric, renal,&#xD;
             or other diseases that in the opinion of the investigator, would put the patient at&#xD;
             risk through study participation, or would affect the study analyses if the disease&#xD;
             exacerbated during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Hypersensitivity to any sympathomimetic drug (e.g. salbutamol) or any inhaled,&#xD;

             from the patient's usual status) or symptoms or signs of viral or bacterial, upper or&#xD;
             lower respiratory tract infection or sinus or middle ear infection within 4 weeks&#xD;

&#xD;
          9. Factors (e.g., infirmity, disability or geographic location) that the investigator&#xD;
             felt would likely limit the patient's compliance with the study protocol or scheduled&#xD;

&#xD;
         10. Female Subjects who are pregnant or breastfeeding.&#xD;
