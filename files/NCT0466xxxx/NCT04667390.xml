    <textblock>
      For the first time in Russia, it is planned to introduce and study primary knee arthroplasty&#xD;
      using an active robotic system. The aim is to increase the efficiency of primary total knee&#xD;
      arthroplasty using an active robotic surgical system. Traditional endoprosthetics of the knee&#xD;
      joint (TKA) has now reached its maximum manufacturability and efficiency, but the accuracy of&#xD;
      the performance depends on the skill and experience of the surgeon, as well as the efficiency&#xD;
      of the cutting instrument (oscillator saw) when performing bone resection, the condition of&#xD;
      the instrument and on the density of bone tissue fabric, which is highly variable. Modern RSS&#xD;
      used in orthopedics include a robotic arm, robotic cutting devices with a computer navigation&#xD;
      system, which are in active, semi-automatic or passive control mode. The main advantage of&#xD;
      robotic systems is accurate preliminary planning using 3D modeling, use individual implant&#xD;
      selection and virtual positioning.The active robotic surgical system TSolution-One allows&#xD;
      participants to level the error in the positioning of the implant. The active robotic&#xD;
      surgical system (ARSS) allows to correctly install the implant, which affects its service&#xD;
      life, reduces the risks of postoperative complications, quickly returns to the usual way of&#xD;
      life and forgets about the technical negative sensations and limitations that existed before&#xD;
      the operation.It is planned to conduct an open-label retrospective and prospective clinical&#xD;
      study in parallel observations.The study is planned to include 300 patients with&#xD;
      osteoarthritis of the knee joint stage 3-4 (according to Kellgren-Lawrence). Investigators&#xD;
      took three groups of patients, 100 patients each, and offered different options for total&#xD;
      knee arthroplasty techniques.According to the research:-A clinical active robotic system for&#xD;
      primary total knee arthroplasty will be introduced in Russia-There will be recommended&#xD;
      indications and contraindications for this system in patients with gonarthrosis-The&#xD;
      methodology of preoperative planning will be improved-The results of primary knee&#xD;
      arthroplasty with an active robotic system will be evaluated in comparison with standard&#xD;
      techniques and computer navigation-The methodology developed and improved in the dissertation&#xD;
      will be introduced into the work of the clinical departments of traumatology, orthopedics and&#xD;
      disaster surgery, studying the learning curve.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Relevance: Robotic technologies were first introduced into medicine in the 1950s. The use of&#xD;
      robotic systems in surgery begins with the use in neurosurgery. In 1985, the Programmable&#xD;
      Universal Manipulation Arm (PUMA) 560 was introduced to perform CT-guided brain biopsy. In&#xD;
      1992, the Robodoc system (IBM) became the first orthopedic robotic system used in orthopedics&#xD;
      for hip replacement, which subsequently improved the ability to automatically perform the&#xD;
      stages of prosthetics. (Caspar system, Acrobot). Around the same time, the development of a&#xD;
      robot for performing total knee arthroplasty began.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A distinctive feature of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is the manufacturability of the stages&#xD;
      and the high accuracy of surgical manipulations, which attracts the attention of many robotic&#xD;
      surgical systems (RSS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditional total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has now reached its maximum manufacturability and&#xD;
      efficiency, but the accuracy of the performance depends on the skill and experience of the&#xD;
      surgeon, as well as the accuracy of the cutting instrument (oscillator saw) when performing&#xD;
      bone resection, the condition of the instrument and the density of the bone fabric, which is&#xD;
      highly variable. The use of intramedullary guides during conventional surgery increases the&#xD;
      risk of thromboembolic and cardiorespiratory complications. Computer navigation partially&#xD;
      solves the problem of resection accuracy, infrared cameras read information from sensors and&#xD;
      display a model with anatomical and kinematic features of the knee joint, which helps the&#xD;
      surgeon to more accurately determine the level and direction of resection, but cannot ensure&#xD;
      the accuracy of this manipulation and compliance with the preoperative plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modern RSS used in orthopedics include a robotic arm, robotic cutting devices with a computer&#xD;
      navigation system that operate in an active, semi-automatic, or passive control mode. The&#xD;
      main advantage of robotic systems is accurate preoperative planning using 3D modeling, the&#xD;
      possibility of individual selection of the implant and virtual positioning. Another advantage&#xD;
      is the ability to accurately reproduce the preoperative plan during orthopedic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today, active robotic surgical systems (ARSS) are used in clinical practice. ROBODOC /&#xD;
      TSolution One. Robotic Surgical System (Curexo Technology, Fremont, Calif.), And Navio PFS&#xD;
      (Blue Belt Technologies, Plymouth, Minnesota) Semi-Active Surgical Systems, OMNI Robotic&#xD;
      System (OMNIlife Science, East Taunton, MA), RIO Robotic Arm Interactive Orthopedic System&#xD;
      (Mako Surgical Corporation, Fort Lauderdale, Florida), ROSA Knee (Zimmer Zimmer Biomet,&#xD;
      Montreal (Quebec), Canada).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The active robotic surgical system TSolution-One allows participants to level the error in&#xD;
      the positioning of the implant. The accuracy of the filing is not affected by the manual&#xD;
      skills of the surgeon, and does not depend on the density of bone tissue. Significant&#xD;
      advantages of the system are: 1) precise preoperative breading; 2) rigid fixation of the&#xD;
      limb, hip and tibia displacement sensors; 3) active autonomous milling without the&#xD;
      participation of a surgeon; 4) accuracy of resection according to the preoperative plan; 5)&#xD;
      rotation of the tibial component as in the preoperative plan; 6) no manual tools required; 7)&#xD;
      postoperative control of the results of the operation. The active robotic surgical system&#xD;
      (ARSS) allows participants to correctly install the implant, which affects its service life,&#xD;
      reduces the risks of postoperative complications, the patient quickly returns to his usual&#xD;
      way of life and forgets about those negative feelings and limitations that were before the&#xD;
      operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The novelty of the proposed topic: For the first time in Russia, it is planned to introduce&#xD;
      and study total knee arthroplasty using an active robotic system. Apply the use of a 3D&#xD;
