  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For patients with kidney failure the two treatment options are kidney transplantation or&#xD;
      dialysis. Transplantation offers longer survival, better quality of life and provides cost&#xD;
      savings for the health system (&gt;$60,000/year per patient). Unfortunately, there are not&#xD;
      enough organs available and 20% of patients die on dialysis waiting for a deceased donor&#xD;
      kidney.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Living kidney donation is a safe and proven treatment that leads to even better patient and&#xD;
      health system outcomes than deceased donor kidney transplant. The Kidney Health Strategic&#xD;
      Clinical Network (KH-SCN) identified increasing living kidney donation as a priority and in&#xD;
      2015 established the Living Donor Kidney Transplant Working Group (LDKTWG) comprised of&#xD;
      patients, donors, health care professionals, researchers, and administrators. In an evidenced&#xD;
      review published by the investigators, the intervention with the best evidence and greatest&#xD;
      impact was personalized support provided by a multidisciplinary team to inform and educate&#xD;
      the patients' social network. This intervention increased living kidney donations by 34%. The&#xD;
      investigators confirmed through a province wide survey that many patients with kidney failure&#xD;
      are unable to find a living kidney donor and find it difficult to approach potential donors&#xD;
      due to lack of skills, supports, and resources and these issues are particularly apparent in&#xD;
      vulnerable populations. The investigators have developed the Multidisciplinary Support To&#xD;
      Access living donor Kidney Transplant (MuST AKT) intervention to support patients in&#xD;
      identifying and communicating with their social networks. The investigators will test the&#xD;
      effectiveness of this intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Living donor kidney transplantation is the optimal treatment for end-stage kidney disease&#xD;
      patients, dramatically improving survival and quality of life, providing significant cost&#xD;
      saving compared with dialysis, reducing the demand for deceased donor transplants and the&#xD;
      pressure to increase dialysis capacity and infrastructure. Outcome data shows that only 16%&#xD;
      of Canadians on dialysis survive past 10 years, whereas up to 74% of Canadians with a kidney&#xD;
      transplant have a functioning kidney after 10 years. The ideal treatment trajectory is to&#xD;
      avoid dialysis entirely and receive a living donor transplant prior to dialysis&#xD;
      (pre-emptive), which unfortunately only occurs in 10.5% of eligible patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with end-stage kidney disease report being overwhelmed with other issues (loss of&#xD;
      work, family stress, fear of dialysis) and lack the skills needed to comfortably engage&#xD;
      potential living donors - many feel uncomfortable doing so and do not know how to start. The&#xD;
      purpose of this research is to test an intervention designed to support patients&#xD;
      identification of potential donors and communication with their social network and ultimately&#xD;
      increase the number of living donor kidney transplantations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rate of living kidney donor transplantation is lower in Alberta compared to other&#xD;
      provinces in Canada. As the rate of kidney failure has increased over the past few years in&#xD;
      Alberta, it is necessary to improve and facilitate the process of living kidney donor&#xD;
      transplantation for better patient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to examine the efficacy of the MuST AKT program to&#xD;
      facilitate patients' identification of potential living kidney donors compared to usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the MuST AKT program will increase the proportion of&#xD;
      participants with at least one potential living kidney donors who started evaluation&#xD;
      (intervention vs control).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to evaluate patient outcome improvement by collecting Patient&#xD;
      Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) to assess the proportion of patients who find at least one&#xD;
      potential living donor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tertiary objective is to evaluate patient experience by collecting Patient Reported&#xD;
      Experience Measures (PREMs) to determine whether participants recommend this program to other&#xD;
      patients and to what extent this program gave them confidence for finding a potential living&#xD;
      kidney donor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quaternary objective is to evaluate the feasibility of this program by assessing consent&#xD;
      rate, attendance, adherence, and drop-out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Methods/Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot parallel randomized controlled trial with a qualitative interview component.&#xD;
      The intervention condition will receive a multidisciplinary, tailored person-centered&#xD;
      intervention over three months (MuST AKT program), and the control condition will receive the&#xD;
      current standard of care (social worker assessment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have been referred for kidney transplantation assessment in Edmonton will be&#xD;
      contacted during a standard care kidney transplant education session or over the telephone if&#xD;
      patients have completed the transplant education and are on the deceased kidney donor&#xD;
      wait-list. Patients who expressed interest will be contacted via telephone by a member of the&#xD;
      research team to seek their consent, complete the initial screening assessment to confirm&#xD;
      their eligibility and enrolment, and then complete a baseline questionnaire. Then&#xD;
      participants will be randomized to either the intervention or control condition, using&#xD;
      predetermined randomly-generated (by Stata MP 15Â·1) permuted blocks of 4 and 6. Assignment to&#xD;
      condition will be concealed by the database up until the point of assignment. Participants in&#xD;
      the intervention condition will receive the MuST AKT program and participants in the control&#xD;
      condition will receive usual care. Consent rate, attendance, adherence, and drop-out will be&#xD;
      tracked during enrollment and the duration of the intervention. Upon completion of the&#xD;
      intervention (or usual care), participants will complete a post-intervention questionnaire to&#xD;
      assess PREMs. Participants in the intervention condition will be contacted after they have&#xD;
      completed the post-questionnaire to participate in a qualitative interview lasting&#xD;
      approximately 40 minutes. Kidney transplant status will be tracked for a period of 12 months&#xD;
      post-intervention. Participants in the intervention condition who do not have a potential&#xD;
      donor come forward after 12 months will be contacted to complete an additional interview to&#xD;
      explore factors contributing to their lack of success, which will last approximately 40&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Condition: MuST AKT is a multidisciplinary, tailored person-centered&#xD;
      intervention aimed to support participants identification of potential donors and&#xD;
      communication with their social network. A one-on-one introductory session will be followed&#xD;
      by three 'one-on-one' sessions (A, B and C) and a final session D with participants family&#xD;
      and friends (potential donors and advocates) identified in session A. All group and&#xD;
      individual sessions will be arranged virtually during the COVID-19 pandemic, and may be held&#xD;
      either virtually or in-person, at the participants discretion, in the event that the COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic concludes and physical distancing requirements have been eliminated. Each education&#xD;
      session will take approximately 90 minutes. Sessions will be facilitated by a trained&#xD;
      licensed social worker, coordinator or social media expert with extra training in kidney&#xD;
      disease, transplantation, living kidney donation, counselling and interviewing, and patient&#xD;
      confidentiality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usual care (control condition): In the control condition, participants will go through the&#xD;
      current standard of care, which is a social worker assessment. If the intervention is&#xD;
      successful in the definitive RCT (to be conducted later) and approved by Alberta Health&#xD;
      Services as the 'new standard of care', people in control condition will be contacted and&#xD;
      given the option to participate in the MuST AKT program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional interviews with separate informed consent procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Patients) If, during recruitment for the study, the individual indicates they do not want to&#xD;
      participate, or if participants drop-out of the study, a research team member will invite&#xD;
      them participate in a 20-40 minute interview to understand barriers to participation in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Friends and family of patients) Friends and family members of participants who take part in&#xD;
      session D will be invited to participate in an interview approximately 40 minutes long which&#xD;
      aims to explore their experiences of group session D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan for Data Analysis - Quantitative:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All analyses will be completed in Stata/MP 15.1 (www.stata.com), following an&#xD;
      intention-to-treat approach. The investigators will use the Fisher's exact tests (dichotomous&#xD;
      outcomes) and the t-tests or Kruskal-Wallis tests (continuous outcomes data), as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan for Data Analysis - Qualitative Telephone interviews will be conducted using&#xD;
      semi-structured interview guides. Data will be analyzed using a thematic analysis approach,&#xD;
      whereby common themes that emerge from the data are documented. The qualitative software&#xD;
      NVivo-12 will be used in the analysis.&#xD;
