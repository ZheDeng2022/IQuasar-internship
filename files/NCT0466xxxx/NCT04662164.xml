  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, repeat-dose study to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of L47 as an add-on treatment to stable metformin therapy in&#xD;
      patients with T2DM. Approximately 30 subjects will be randomized into the study at up to two&#xD;
      investigational sites. The study includes a screening period of up to 28 days, with a&#xD;
      three-day, single-blind, placebo lead-in period; a four-week, double-blind treatment period;&#xD;
      and a one-week follow-up period. There will be 2 inpatient stays (Day -3 to 2 and 27 to 29)&#xD;
      and daily outpatient visits during treatment period. During the follow-up period, there will&#xD;
      be 1 outpatient visit at the end of the study. There will be 3 cohorts of 10 subjects each to&#xD;
      be enrolled sequentially. In each cohort, subjects will be randomized in a 4:1 ratio to&#xD;
      receive either L47 or placebo subcutaneously. Subjects will monitor fasting capillary glucose&#xD;
      (finger sticks or self-monitoring of blood glucose, SMBG) during the lead-in, treatment, and&#xD;
      follow-up periods.&#xD;
