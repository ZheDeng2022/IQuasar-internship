  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomised, assessor-blinded parallel-groups superiority clinical trial,&#xD;
      allocating a total of 266 patients to either the experimental intervention or standard&#xD;
      intervention. The participants will be randomised to either 12-weeks of avatar therapy or&#xD;
      treatment as usual. All participants will be assessed at 12- and 24 weeks post baseline. A&#xD;
      stratified block-randomisation with concealed randomisation sequence will be conducted.&#xD;
      Independent assessors blinded to the treatment will evaluate outcome. Analysis of outcome&#xD;
      will be carried out with the intention to treat principles.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Auditory hallucinations are among the most frequent symptoms in psychotic disorders. While a&#xD;
      large group of patients with first episode psychosis achieve remission of psychotic symptoms&#xD;
      during first year after initial contact with mental health services, almost one third&#xD;
      continue having psychotic symptoms in spite of treatment with antipsychotic medication. Since&#xD;
      auditory hallucinations are a major cause of distress and suffering for these patients, there&#xD;
      is an essential need to test the effectives of targeted psychotherapeutic interventions in&#xD;
      alleviating auditory hallucinations Two previous trials have provided preliminary evidence of&#xD;
      the effectiveness of avatar therapy on auditory hallucinations, but no trial to date has&#xD;
      examined the effect of virtual reality assisted avatar therapy in an adequately powered RCT.&#xD;
      In this large-scale randomized, clinical trial, patients in the experimental intervention&#xD;
      will be receiving 7 sessions of virtual reality assisted avatar therapy while patients in the&#xD;
      TAU group will receive 7 sessions of supportive contact with mental health care professionals&#xD;
      at their regular outpatient clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the virtual reality avatar therapy is found to be beneficial in reducing the severity of&#xD;
      refractory auditory hallucinations, it will be a breakthrough in the current treatment of&#xD;
      psychotic disorders. A large group of patients with schizophrenia and related disorders in&#xD;
      Denmark and worldwide will be the target group of the therapy. If proven effective, the&#xD;
      treatment will be especially relevant for patients with treatment resistant schizophrenia,&#xD;
      but the treatment can also be used as an add on to antipsychotic medication for patients with&#xD;
      a better prognosis, such as patients with first episode psychosis. If the virtual avatar&#xD;
      therapy is proven effective, it can be implemented in mental health services all over Denmark&#xD;
      and internationally. A successful implementation will substantially reduce the costs&#xD;
      associated with treatment of schizophrenia.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will be offered seven individual sessions of avatar therapy and two booster sessions conducted by a skilled therapist. In the initial phase of treatment, the participants create a virtual avatar that corresponds to their visual perception of the source of their voice. The therapist initiates, encourages and supports a dialogue between the participant and the avatar by alternating between talking as the avatar and as a supportive therapist. The therapy sessions last 45 minutes of which around 15 minutes is spent in dialogue with the avatar. The remaining 30 minutes will be used on preparing the patient for the confrontation with the avatar, evaluating on the interaction with the avatar, and use general cognitive behavioral techniques to reduce the auditory hallucination. The treatment is conducted with the use of virtual reality, so the participant will wear VR headset during treatment and watch and talk with the avatar shown in front of him or her.</description>
