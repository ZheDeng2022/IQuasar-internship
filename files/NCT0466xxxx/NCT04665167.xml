      This study will determine the feasibility and effectiveness of delivering an online therapy&#xD;
      for eating pathology and body image disturbance. It will address body image and eating&#xD;
      pathology in a non-clinical group of young adult women, who are at risk of developing such&#xD;
      problems . The feasibility study will determine whether there are any difficulties that would&#xD;
      need to be addressed in recruitment, online delivery and assessment of those treatments.&#xD;

    <description>Exposure therapy is a key element of evidence-based cognitive behaviour therapy for eating disorders . Body image exposure intervention involves deliberate, planned, and systematic exposure to the body image. Participants will be asked to stand so that they can see their whole body - far enough back. Participants will be asked to look at their bodies on screen. Participants will be continually encouraged by the facilitator for looking at and talking about the body parts.</description>
