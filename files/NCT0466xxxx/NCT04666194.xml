    <textblock>
      Complete polypectomy is one of the major factors for effectiveness of colonoscopy to prevent&#xD;
      colon cancer. Given the prevalence of the 4-6 mm polyp, and the concern about interval&#xD;
      cancers at polypectomy sites, there is a clear and significant need to determine which&#xD;
      technique(s) are most appropriate for clinical practice. This study was to compare the three&#xD;
      commonly used polypectomy techniques in terms of efficacy and efficiency.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colonoscopic polypectomy is one of the most commonly performed procedures in the United&#xD;
      States. Despite the frequency with which polypectomy is performed, there is a remarkable&#xD;
      absence of data regarding which polypectomy techniques most effectively remove polyps and&#xD;
      minimize complications. As a result, polypectomy practice is based on the observational&#xD;
      experience of experts and is how it is taught by attending physicians in fellowship training&#xD;
      programs. It is not surprising therefore, that polypectomy practice is not consistent across&#xD;
      the U.S., particularly for polyps in the 4-6 mm range, with 19% of endoscopists using cold&#xD;
      forceps, 21% using hot forceps, 31% using a hot snare, 15% using a cold snare, and the&#xD;
      remainder using a combination of these techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness of colonoscopy in the prevention of colorectal cancer (CRC) depends on&#xD;
      polypectomy; most polyps removed during colonoscopy are &lt; 1 cm in size. Because of their&#xD;
      greater prevalence relative to larger polyps, polyps &lt; 1 cm are responsible for most cases of&#xD;
      post-polypectomy bleeding (even though the absolute risk is higher with larger polyps).&#xD;
      Perhaps more concerning, several studies of surveillance colonoscopy have reported finding&#xD;
      CRC within a few years of a complete colonoscopy. Nearly 30% of these cancers have occurred&#xD;
      in colonic segments where prior polypectomy was performed, suggesting that incomplete removal&#xD;
      may be responsible for the recurrence of neoplasia; in more than half of these cases, the&#xD;
      initial polyp removed was 1 cm or less in size. Unfortunately, these studies are limited&#xD;
      because the precise location of the polypectomy site relative to the subsequent cancer is&#xD;
      uncertain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the prevalence of the 4-6 mm polyp, the variation in polypectomy technique among&#xD;
      endoscopists, and the concern about interval cancers at polypectomy sites, there is a clear&#xD;
      and significant need to determine which technique(s) are most appropriate for clinical&#xD;
      practice in terms of having the lowest risk for recurrent neoplasia and for major adverse&#xD;
      effects (major bleeding, perforation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this trial is to determine the superior method for polypectomy [cold biopsy&#xD;
      forceps (CF), cold snare (CS), or hot snare (HS)] in the removal of adenomatous colonic&#xD;
      polyps that are 4-6 mm in maximal diameter for the subsequent risk of recurrent neoplasia at&#xD;
      the polypectomy site. A randomized trial comparing these three polypectomy techniques for the&#xD;
      outcome of recurrent neoplasia at the polypectomy site requires at least 700 persons per&#xD;
      group (at least 2100 persons total). (A trial powered to compare complication rates would&#xD;
      require a sample size that is an order of magnitude greater than this and is beyond the&#xD;
      feasibility and scope of both pilot and definitive trials.) Further, patients would need to&#xD;
      undergo 3- or 5-year surveillance colonoscopy, which requires a research infrastructure to&#xD;
      ensure complete and accurate data collection. Before embarking on this large-scale trial to&#xD;
      examine effectiveness of polypectomy techniques, we must first demonstrate feasibility of&#xD;
      conducting such a trial and determine the time frame, sampling frame, and resources required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aim of this proposal is to conduct a pilot randomized trial to establish:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the feasibility of conducting a definitive, single-institution, multi-site clinical&#xD;
           trial comparing the three modalities for removing adenomatous colonic polyps 4-6 mm. The&#xD;
           processes that will be assessed are patient enrollment, recruitment, exclusion, and&#xD;
           determination of final eligibility for the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the numbers of patients at each site (IU Hospital, Wishard Memorial Hospital/Eskenazi&#xD;
           Health Hospital) who would be candidates for the larger, definitive study (This&#xD;
           information will help estimate the time line and resources required for the definitive&#xD;
           study).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. the proportions of recruited patients that fall into the 3- and 5-year surveillance&#xD;
           groups (or other surveillance interval, along with the reason(s) for the interval).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A single-institution, three-site clinical trial is feasible: patients can be recruited&#xD;
           and enrolled as potential subjects; final eligibility based on endoscopic and&#xD;
           histological findings can be established within a week of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Investigators can identify the number of patients at each site who would be eligible for&#xD;
           participation in a larger, more definitive study, from all patients undergoing&#xD;
           colonoscopy. Investigators can establish refusal and exclusion rates. (Knowing both&#xD;
           rates is necessary for planning the larger study.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The proportion of recruited patients in the 5-year surveillance group is approximately&#xD;
           80% of all persons with neoplasia; the remaining 20% comprise the 3-year surveillance&#xD;
           group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators conducted an randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing polypectomy using&#xD;
      CF, CS and HS. This trial was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Indiana&#xD;
      University on March 6, 2008. It was conducted at three endoscopy units staffed by Indiana&#xD;
      University Medical Center Gastroenterology faculty: Indiana University Hospital, Springmill&#xD;
      endoscopy center and Eskenazi Health Hospital. Patients were recruited between September 2009&#xD;
      and May 2013 and were followed with surveillance colonoscopy until October 2019. Sample size&#xD;
      for the study was estimated based on the primary outcome of recurrent neoplasia at the&#xD;
      polypectomy site at surveillance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outpatients between ages 18- and 70 years undergoing outpatient screening, surveillance, or&#xD;
      diagnostic colonoscopy and able to provide informed consent were eligible. Eligible patients&#xD;
      presenting for colonoscopy, at 1 of 3 endoscopy units, from July 2009 to May 2013 were&#xD;
      invited to participate in the study by research coordinators (RC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colonoscopy was performed in standard fashion with Olympus 180 series colonoscopes. If the&#xD;
      subject was found to have â‰¥1 adenomatous colon polyps (as predicted by endoscopist) 4-6 mm in&#xD;
      size with Paris morphology of types I or Paris morphology IIa in the colon, randomization to&#xD;
      one of three polypectomy methods was done in a 1:1:1 ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following parameters for each study polyp (SP) were recorded: a) location, b) size, c)&#xD;
      morphology (flat, sessile, or pedunculated), d) method of removal and e) pathology. For CF&#xD;
      polypectomy, standard-sized radial jaw 4 biopsy forceps with a 2.8 mm needle were used and&#xD;
      the number of bites for complete polypectomy was recorded. Polypectomy time was measured from&#xD;
      time of appearance of forceps through the endoscope channel to polyp retrieval. For CS and HS&#xD;
      polypectomy, 11 mm snares were used and the number of times the snare was used to complete&#xD;
      the polypectomy was recorded. The size of the polyps was assessed using the span of the open&#xD;
      radial jaw 4 forceps (7 mm) and the diameter of the snare catheter (2.5 mm) or the open snare&#xD;
      diameter (11 mm). For any single patient, up to 5 SPs were removed under research protocol.&#xD;
      HS polypectomy was performed using monopolar forced coagulation current, wattage range 18-20.&#xD;
      There was no limit to the non-study polyps (NSP) resected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time to perform CS polypectomy was recorded from the time of appearance of snare through&#xD;
      endoscope channel to polyp retrieval or the determination that the polyp was not retrievable.&#xD;
      For HS, time was recorded from initiation of cautery set up to polyp retrieval or the&#xD;
      determination that the polyp was not retrievable. For any single patient all SPs were removed&#xD;
      using the same technique. Patients with non-neoplastic polyps were excluded post hoc from the&#xD;
      analytical sample. Patients were also excluded post randomization if the assigned polypectomy&#xD;
      method could not be used or if additional methods were required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following polyp resection and retrieval, 2-5 ml of tattoo ink (SPOTâ“‡ Ex stain) was injected&#xD;
      1-2 cm to the left and proximal to the polypectomy site. The surveillance interval was&#xD;
      determined according to guidelines as follows: a) For 1-2 tubular adenomas (TA), 5-10 years;&#xD;
      b) For 3 or more TAs, 3 years; c) For a TA &gt;= 1 cm, a polyp with villous histology, or one&#xD;
      with high-grade dysplasia, 3 years; d) For a large sessile polyp removed piecemeal, 3-6&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During surveillance colonoscopy, the previous polypectomy site was examined. Adequacy of&#xD;
      polypectomy was determined by absence of recurrent adenoma tissue. Biopsy of the previous&#xD;
      polypectomy site was not required unless neoplasia recurrence was suspected based on visual&#xD;
      inspection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data were collected using standardized data collection forms, and the information was&#xD;
      transferred to an Excel spreadsheet (Version 16) for analysis.&#xD;
