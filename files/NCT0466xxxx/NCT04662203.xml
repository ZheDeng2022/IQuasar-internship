      The purpose of this study was to investigate in large scale routine primary care data whether&#xD;
      frailty is a prognostic factor for relevant outcomes in the management of hypertension in&#xD;
      older people and whether frailty causes effect modification of the association of blood&#xD;
      pressure or blood pressure lowering treatment and outcomes in older people.&#xD;

      A retrospective cohort study used linked electronic health records from the Welsh Secure&#xD;
      Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) databank. All patients had hypertension in the absence&#xD;
      of established cardiovascular disease, and were over the age of 65 years in 2007. Systolic&#xD;
      blood pressure and frailty, measured using the electronic frailty index were recorded.&#xD;
      Patients were followed up for ten years. Time to event analysis measured first ever major&#xD;
      adverse cardiovascular or cerebrovascular event (MACCE), all-cause mortality and injurious&#xD;
      falls. Adjustment was made for established cardiovascular risk factors.&#xD;
