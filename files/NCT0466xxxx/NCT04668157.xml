  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of this study is to check the safety of TAK-536. This study will take place in&#xD;
      Japan. At the first visit, the study doctor will check if each child can take part. For those&#xD;
      who can take part, each participant will have a check-up by the study doctor. This might take&#xD;
      2 weeks or longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After this, parents or the caregivers of each participant will be given sachets that contain&#xD;
      granules of TAK-536 to give to that participant. The participants will take the TAK-536&#xD;
      granules once a day for 52 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After treatment has finished, participants will visit the study clinic for a final check-up.&#xD;

      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-536. TAK-536 is being tested in pediatric&#xD;
      participants with hypertension aged 2 to less than 6 years. This study will look at the&#xD;
      safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of long-term administration of TAK-536.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll 10 participants. Participants will receive the study drug (TAK-536)&#xD;
      orally once daily before or after breakfast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial dose of TAK-536 will be 0.1 mg/kg (not exceeding 2.5 mg/day). After the initial&#xD;
      dose, TAK-536 will be titrated to 0.2 mg/kg (not exceeding 5 mg/day), 0.4 mg/kg (not&#xD;
      exceeding 10 mg/day), and 0.8 mg/kg (not exceeding 20 mg/day) if the participants do not&#xD;
      achieve the target blood pressure and no concerns are found in safety and tolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Japan. The overall time to participate in this&#xD;
      study is approximately 56 weeks. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic.&#xD;
