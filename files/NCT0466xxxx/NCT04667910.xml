      Following a 14-day maximum screening period, patients will be randomized and followed for&#xD;
      approximately 52 weeks. Treatment visits will be scheduled in 4-week intervals. After 6&#xD;
      initial monthly injections of 601 or ranibizumab (loading phase), subjects will enter an&#xD;
      individualized flexible treatment (IFT) phase (week 24 to week 48). During the IFT phase, an&#xD;
      assessment of disease stability will be performed at each monthly visit and subjects will&#xD;
      receive either an injection or not. Safety and efficacy outcomes will continue to be&#xD;
      evaluated up to a period of 52 weeks unless the patient is withdrawn or discontinues the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
