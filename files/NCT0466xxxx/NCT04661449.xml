  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Large-for-gestational-age (LGA) infants have a higher risk of metabolic disease later in&#xD;
      life, and their postnatal growth in early childhood may be associated with long-term adverse&#xD;
      outcomes. The purpose of this study is to explore whether comprehensive lifestyle&#xD;
      intervention in the first year after birth in LGA infants will reduce the rate of&#xD;
      overweight/obesity at childhood and improve neurodevelopmental outcomes and its possible&#xD;
      mechanism.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Term LGA infants will be randomly divided into two groups shortly after birth: intervention&#xD;
      group and control group. Infants in intervention group will attend the follow-up clinic and&#xD;
      motor development assessment and guidance will be provided every three months in the first&#xD;
      year. Other lifestyle interventions include feeding guidance and healthcare education.&#xD;
      Infants in control group will routinely attend the follow-up clinic every six months. Primary&#xD;
      outcome is the rate of overweight/obesity at two years old and seven years old.&#xD;
      Neurodevelopmental assessment, carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and blood pressure at&#xD;
      childhood will also be evaluated. The association of the outcome of LGA infants at two years&#xD;
      old and the biomarkers in cord blood will be investigated, which includes serum leptin,&#xD;
      insulin, insulin-like growth factors -1 (IGF-1), blood lipid series and adiponectin.&#xD;
