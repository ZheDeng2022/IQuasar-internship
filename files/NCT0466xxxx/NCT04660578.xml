    <textblock>
      Placenta praevia and accreta spectrum disorders are rising in incidence due to increased rate&#xD;
      of repeat caesarean sections. Peripartum hysterectomy remains the only definitive treatment&#xD;
      of massive postpartum haemorrhage related to this condition. A multitude of conservative&#xD;
      treatments is described in literature, which includes pelvic devascularization under&#xD;
      radiological control, myometrial resection with placenta in situ, and various suturing&#xD;
      techniques some involving inversion of cervix. Variable success rates are described, but&#xD;
      search continues for a simple, safe and effective treatment. Such a surgical technique i.e.&#xD;
      A. Chohan Continuous Squeezing Suture (ACCSS) is described in this study for controlling&#xD;
      haemorrhage from the lower uterine segment at caesarean section for placenta praevia and&#xD;
      accrete spectrum disorders.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) has always been a prominent cause of maternal morbidity as well&#xD;
      as mortality worldwide, with uterine atony as the leading cause and peripartum hysterectomy&#xD;
      as the only definitive treatment option . Researchers are struggling throughout the years to&#xD;
      find a treatment modality other than hysterectomy, which has least morbidity and potential to&#xD;
      preserve fertility. In an attempt to find a non-radical treatment for PPH due to uterine&#xD;
      atony, a novel uterine compression suture was introduced in 1997. The time then witnessed&#xD;
      emergence of a series of its variants from all over the world which effectively lowered the&#xD;
      incidence of peripartum hysterectomy from uterine atony.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meanwhile the incidence of placenta praevia and placenta accreta spectrum disorder rose&#xD;
      dramatically across the globe because of rising incidence of repeat caesarean sections.&#xD;
      Placenta accreta spectrum has opened up a new era in the history of PPH, as forcible&#xD;
      separation of adherent placenta leads to massive bleeding from placental bed. Peripartum&#xD;
      hysterectomy has once again emerged as gold standard treatment for this variety of PPH with&#xD;
      its overall morbidity of 40-50%, and mortality of 7-10% in case of placenta percreta. The&#xD;
      fear of placental bed bleeding has led to the development of conservative managements like&#xD;
      &quot;leaving the placenta in situ approach&quot; with its wide range of mild to severe, and serious&#xD;
      morbidities. The conservative surgical techniques i.e. The triple P procedure, one step&#xD;
      conservative surgery approach, have also used the concept of non-separation of placenta and&#xD;
      have instead adopted resection of myometrium with placenta in situ. These surgeries involve&#xD;
      devascularisation of deep pelvic / major abdominal vessels and ligation of complex arterial&#xD;
      anastomosis making the procedure technically difficult. Moreover, the devascularisation is&#xD;
      done under extensive and expensive interventional radiological equipment which places the&#xD;
      procedures out of reach for the routine setups particularly in the under developed countries.&#xD;
      Another conservative surgical technique i.e. stepwise surgical approach, which described&#xD;
      separation of placenta also mainly relied upon devascularisation of pelvic organs by&#xD;
      bilateral ligation of anterior branch of internal iliac artery rather than elaborating the&#xD;
      details of technique of controlling haemorrhage at the actual bleeding site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three corners stones of uterine compression sutures have been described in literature i.e.&#xD;
      simplicity, safety and efficacy and no such suturing technique so far is published. Hence,&#xD;
      it's the time for innovation in the treatment of placenta praevia and PAS. In this study, we&#xD;
      report our own experience of a conservative surgical technique i.e. A. Chohan Continuous&#xD;
      Squeezing Suture (ACCSS) application in the lower uterine segment during caesarean section in&#xD;
      profusely bleeding patients with placenta praevia and placenta accreta spectrum without&#xD;
      involvement of urinary bladder and other pelvic organs. This surgical technique takes on the&#xD;
      separation of placenta and describes a placental bed suturing without involvement of&#xD;
      interventional radiology as well as ligation of deep pelvic vessels. The objective of this&#xD;
      study is to assess the simplicity, safety and efficacy of this surgical technique in the&#xD;
      management of PAS, with the intension to develop a simple, safe and effective alternative to&#xD;
      hysterectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After opening the abdomen, a transverse incision was given in the lower uterine segment after&#xD;
      ascertaining the site of easy fetal access avoiding the placenta as far as possible. After&#xD;
      the delivery of the baby, the uterus was exteriorized and routine uterotonics were given. The&#xD;
      placenta was left in-situ and incision margins were held with Green-armitage forceps to&#xD;
      minimize bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The urinary bladder was dissected away to allow suturing on the inner side of the lower&#xD;
      uterine segment. Uterine arteries were ligated on both sides and any blood vessels on the way&#xD;
      were secured immediately. The placenta was then removed completely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the puddle of blood, the ring of internal os was identified with the index and middle&#xD;
      finger of one hand and held with Babcock forceps with the other hand. On the exposed inner&#xD;
      surface of the LUS, suturing was started from the left corner of uterine incision, taking&#xD;
      multiple half cm bites through half-thickness of the tissue at half cm intervals to reach the&#xD;
      outer half of ring of the internal os. The suture was then tied and knot secured causing&#xD;
      squeezing of uterine tissue. From here onwards similar sutures were placed continuously at 1&#xD;
      cm distance till the right corner was reached, where the knot was secured. During suturing it&#xD;
      was ensured that internal os remains patent. The continued pull on the suture caused the&#xD;
      squeezing of the LUS and arrested bleeding from all sinuses present at the placental site. If&#xD;
      the bleeding was seen on the posterior uterine wall, a similar suture was applied. It was&#xD;
      started from the outer half of the posterior lip of the ring of the internal os and going up&#xD;
      to the highest bleeding point on the posterior wall of the uterus, extending from the left to&#xD;
      right end of the uterine incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any left over bleeding points were secured with separate hemostatic sutures, Routine closure&#xD;
      of the uterus was performed in two layers as in the lower segment cesarean section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hospital stay of the patients was 3-7 days. All patients were reviewed on 7th&#xD;
      postoperative day and were inquired about the history of fever, abdominal pain and excessive&#xD;
      vaginal bleeding. The character of vaginal discharge / lochia was noted and any urinary&#xD;
      complaint recorded. Caesarean section wound was examined and stitches removed. Second follow&#xD;
      up visit was at 6 weeks postpartum for similar assessment and record of lactation /&#xD;
      menstruation status. Pelvic ultrasound was done on both visits to detect any pelvic organ&#xD;
      abnormality and collection of blood or pus.&#xD;
