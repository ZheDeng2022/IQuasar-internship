  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Deficient alveolar mandibular ridge corrected distraction osteogenesis to facilitate dental&#xD;
      implant placement. Patients grouped into 2 groups: one group received Cissus quadrangularis&#xD;
      during the consolidation period, and the other group received placebo.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      OPGs were taken immediately after distractor placement, at end of activation period, at&#xD;
      1st,2nd month of consolidation period, and at end of consolidation period. Change in bone&#xD;
      height was evaluated immediately after distractor placement, at end of activation and end of&#xD;
      consolidation periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CBCT were taken immediately after implant installation, and 6 months later to evaluate change&#xD;
      bone density and marginal bone level about the dental implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      histological evaluation was done by biopsy obtained, by trephine bur, from implant site&#xD;
      during its preparation. The bone biopsy fixed in 4% formalin solution for 7 days, rinsed in&#xD;
      water, and dehydrated in sequent phases of ethanol (70, 80, 90, and 100%) and then specimens&#xD;
      were stained by hematoxylin- eosin for microscopic evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiographic evaluation&#xD;
