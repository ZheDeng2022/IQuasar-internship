    <measure>Quality of life as assessed by EUROHIS-QOL 8-item Index</measure>
    <time_frame>4-week</time_frame>
    <description>The EUROHIS-QOL (European Health Interview Survey-Quality of Life) 8-item index is an efficient, valid, and reliable measure of four quality of life domains (physical, psychological, environmental, and social). Items are rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale and summed to produce a total quality of life score with higher scores indicating a higher level of satisfaction with their current quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Opioid craving as assessed by Opioid Craving Scale (OCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>4-week</time_frame>
    <description>OCS is a 3-item measure of opioid craving with acceptable internal consistency, reliability, and concurrent/predictive validity. Participants rate their level of craving in reference to three situations (current, past week, and high-risk environment) on a scale ranging from 0-10 with higher scores indicating a higher level of craving.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Motivation as assessed by Readiness Ruler</measure>
    <time_frame>4-week</time_frame>
    <description>Readiness Ruler is a valid and reliable 2-item measure of motivation and readiness to change. Participants rate their perceived &quot;Importance&quot; of making a change to their drug use behaviors, and their perceived &quot;Confidence&quot; in their ability to successfully achieve their goal (range: 0-100) with higher scores indicating greater motivation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-Efficacy as assessed by Brief Situational Confidence Questionnaire (BSCQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>4-week</time_frame>
    <description>BSCQ is an 8-item measure of self-efficacy for resisting the urge to use drugs in 8 high-risk situations based on the relapse prevention model (unpleasant emotions, physical discomfort, pleasant emotions, testing control, urges/temptations, interpersonal conflict, social pressure, and pleasant times with others). Patients rate their confidence in resisting the urge to use drugs in each of the 8 situations on a scale ranging from 0 (Not at all Confident) to 100 (Extremely Confident).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Opioid use disorder diagnostic criteria as assessed by Diagnostic &amp; Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>4-week</time_frame>
    <description>Participant self-report will be used to determine frequency counts of the 11 opioid use disorder diagnostic criteria per the DSM-5 with higher counts indicating a greater number of symptoms present and higher opioid use disorder severity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Usability of PROCare app as assessed by System Usability Scale (SUS)</measure>
    <time_frame>4-week</time_frame>
    <description>SUS is a 10-item measure commonly used for global assessments of systems usability. SUS scores will be used to objectively quantify the usability of the PROCare recovery app. Participants allocated to the PROCare condition will rate the usability of the app on 10 items assessing different aspects of usability using a Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree) with higher converted total scores indicating a higher level of overall usability.</description>

    <description>PROCare is a reward-based digital recovery management platform for individuals receiving medication treatment for opioid use disorder. Patients have the opportunity to earn both non-monetary and monetary incentives via smart debit card for a variety of clinically-indicated behaviors, including taking their medication (buprenorphine) as directed, attending clinic appointments and community-based mutual-help support group meetings, participating in routine outcomes monitoring surveys using validated measures, accessing the curated psychoeducation content library, and engaging in other recovery-oriented activities within the smartphone app.</description>
