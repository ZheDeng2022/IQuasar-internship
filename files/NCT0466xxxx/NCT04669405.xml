  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High intensity laser therapy (HILT) has been considered as a treatment option for shoulder&#xD;
      pain. To our knowledge, the effectiveness of HILT in patients with hemiplegic shoulder pain&#xD;
      (HSP) with partial thickness rotator cuff tear (PTRCT) is unknown. In this study, we intended&#xD;
      to investigate the effectiveness of HILT on pain, disability, function and quality of life in&#xD;
      patients with HSP accompanied by PTRCT.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was designed as prospective, randomized, controlled trial. Patients with HSP&#xD;
      accompanied by PTRCT (n=44) were randomly assigned to HILT and control groups. Group 1 (HILT&#xD;
      group, n=22) received 3 sessions of HILT per week for 3 weeks in addition to the exercise&#xD;
      program which performed 5 sessions per week for 3 weeks. Group 2 (Control group, n=22)&#xD;
      received an exercise program for HSP of 5 sessions per week for 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were evaluated with Visual Analog Scale (VAS), passive Range of Motion (ROM),&#xD;
      Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI), Nottingham Health Profile (NHP), Functional&#xD;
      Independence Measure (FIM) and ultrasonographic PTRCT size.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 3 weeks (Change from baseline hemiplegic shoulder pain of the patients at 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Severity of pain was assessed using the standart 10 cm VAS with 0 meant &quot;no pain&quot; at one end, and 10 meant &quot;unbearable pain&quot; at the other end</description>

    <measure>Range of motion (ROM) of the hemiplegic shoulder</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 3 weeks (Change from baseline hemiplegic shoulder ROM of the patients at 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Passive ROM measurements of shoulder external rotation, abduction, and flexion movements were recorded by a universal goniometer.</description>

    <measure>Shoulder functional status (SPADI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 3 weeks (Change from baseline hemiplegic shoulder functional status of the patients at 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>SPADI is self-administered questionnaire composed of 5 items assessing pain and 8 items assessing disability. The score varied from 0% to 100%, with higher scores reflected greater pain and disability</description>

    <measure>Motor recovery</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 3 weeks (Change from baseline hemiplegic arm motor recovery of the patients at 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Brunnstrom Recovery Stage (BRS) was used to appreciated the motor function level in the patients. The recovery are divided into six stages: In the 1st stage, there is complete flaccidity, and no voluntary movements in the involved body area, while the 6th stage indicates normal function</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Spastisity</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 3 weeks (Change from baseline hemiplegic arm spasticity of the patients at 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The five-point Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), a clinical scale ranging from 0 to 4 (0 being normal muscle tone, and 4 being rigid) was used for measuring spasticity and muscle tone.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional status (FIM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 3 weeks (Change from baseline functional status of the patients at 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>FIM is a universal assessment tool consisting of a total of 18 items that explores an individual's several physical and social functions, such as self-care, transfer, locomotion, sphincter control, communication and social cognition. Each item is scored on a 7-point ordinal scale ranging from complete independence (score= 7) to complete dependence (score= 1). Higher FIM scores indicate higher levels of independence</description>

    <measure>Quality of life of the hemiplegic patient</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 3 weeks (Change from baseline quality of life of the patients at 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Nottingham Health Profile (NHP), a life quality test, includes 38 yes / no statements regarding pain, physical mobility, emotional reactions, sleep, social isolation and energy level. Ratings on each component are weighted to give a score between 0 and 100. Higher NHP scores show a higher level of trouble</description>

    <measure>Rotator cuff tear size</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 3 weeks (Change from baseline rotator tear cuff size of the patients at 3 weeks</time_frame>
