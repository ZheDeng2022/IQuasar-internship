    <textblock>
      Mueller polarimetric colposcopy appears to be a powerful tool for evaluating cervical&#xD;
      microstructure modification during pregnancy. Some polarimetric parameters of the uterine&#xD;
      cervix can be correlated with the gestational age. The uterine cervix's polarimetric analysis&#xD;
      could make it possible to accurately predict the term of childbirth and be used as a&#xD;
      screening tool for preterm birth.&#xD;

      Interventional research protocol involving the human person relating to a medical device.&#xD;
      This is a prospective, not randomized, monocentric study. Prematurity accounts for around 11%&#xD;
      of births worldwide. In France, around 60,000 children (7.4%) are born each year prematurely.&#xD;
      The term of gestation has a strong impact on mortality, severe neonatal morbidity, and child&#xD;
      development. For this reason, premature birth represents a major public health issue. The&#xD;
      means to reliably predict a premature birth are still ineffective. The medical device used in&#xD;
      this research is a Mueller polarimetric colposcope which appears to be a powerful tool for&#xD;
      evaluating the process of remodeling of cervical microstructure during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mueller polarimetric imaging is the only technique that enables obtaining the comprehensive&#xD;
      polarimetric characterization of a sample. Two groups are considered for this study: i)&#xD;
      patients at low risk of premature birth (Group 1); ii) patients at high risk of premature&#xD;
      birth (Group 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study's main objective is to determine, for the two groups of patients, the best&#xD;
      &quot;polarimetric biomarkers&quot; which make it possible to define an optimal &quot;polarimetric score&quot;&#xD;
      reflecting the state of the cervical microstructure throughout its remodeling process during&#xD;
      pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This &quot;Polarimetric Score&quot; will be able to predict the term of childbirth and used as a&#xD;
      screening tool for prematurity.&#xD;

    <description>The principal outcome will be determining the best &quot;polarimetric biomarkers&quot; able to monitor and quantify the uterine cervix's modifications in a population with a low risk of premature birth. Specifically, the &quot;polarimetric biomarkers&quot; are the most relevant polarimetric parameters (or a combination of them) characterizing the cervical microstructure modifications during a normal pregnancy. They can be the main polarimetric parameters obtained from the measured Mueller matrices using different algebraic methods.&#xD;
One example of a polarimetric parameter that can be assessed is the Phase Retardance, measured in degrees at different wavelengths. It characterizes the anisotropy of the tissue.</description>
