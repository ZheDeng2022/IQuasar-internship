      This study included 76 newly diagnosed RA patients and 50 matched controls. Basal JAK2&#xD;
      mutation was assessed by PCR in blood samples, TNF-Î± and IL 6 were measured by ELISA in serum&#xD;
      of patients and controls. All patients started therapy with conventional synthetic DMARDs&#xD;
      (including methotrexate). Response assessment at 3rd month was evaluated by DAS28 and ACR&#xD;
      response criteria. JAK2 mutation was correlated with different clinical and laboratory&#xD;
      parameters of patients.&#xD;

      PCR detection of the JAK-2 V617F mutation using ASO specific PCR Genetic marker:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The detection of jak2 V617F mutation were done by using the following primers (JAK2 Reverse:&#xD;
      5' CTGAATAGTCCTACAGTGTTTTCAGTTTCA 3', JAK2 Forward (specific): 5'&#xD;
      AGCATTTGGTTTTAAATTATGGAGTATATT 3' and JAK2 Forward (internal control): 5'&#xD;
      ATCTATAGTCATGCTGAAAGTAGGAGAAAG 3'). Cycling conditions were 35 cycles with annealing&#xD;
      temperature 58.5oC flowed by agarose gel 2% electrophoresis for bands detections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients started treatment by conventional synthetic DMARDs (including methotrexate).&#xD;
      Response assessment at 3rd month was evaluated by DAS28 and ACR response criteria. JAK2&#xD;
      mutation was correlated with different clinical and laboratory parameters of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Disease Activity Score (DAS) and the DAS28 have been developed to measure disease&#xD;
      activity in RA both in daily clinical practice as well as in clinical trials on a group as&#xD;
      well as individual level. The DAS/DAS28 is a continuous measure of RA disease activity that&#xD;
      combines information from swollen joints, tender joints, acute phase response and general&#xD;
      health The DAS28 is a measure of disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). DAS stands&#xD;
      for 'disease activity score' and the number 28 refers to the 28 joints that are examined in&#xD;
      this assessment. questionnaires (e.g. the HAQ which assesses function), X-rays, and newer&#xD;
      imaging techniques such as ultrasound and MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ACR20 is a composite measure defined as both improvement of 20% in the number of tender&#xD;
      and number of swollen joints, and a 20% improvement in three of the following five criteria:&#xD;
      patient global assessment, physician global assessment, functional ability measure [most&#xD;
      often Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ)], visual analog pain scale, and erythrocyte&#xD;
      sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein (CRP). ACR50 and ACR70 are the same instruments with&#xD;
      improvement levels defined as 50% and 70% respectively versus 20% for ACR20.&#xD;
