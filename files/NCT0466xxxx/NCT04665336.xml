  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study, it was aimed to examine the effect of circadian timing program created for obese&#xD;
      individuals with evening chronotype on obesity management and sleep quality.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The importance of chronotype, which reflects individual preferences in sleep timing and other&#xD;
      behaviors, for obesity is mostly unknown. Morning types are more successful in long-term&#xD;
      weight control than evening type chronotypes. Those with a sleep preference in the evening&#xD;
      and a long sleep time have a higher rate of being overweight / obese than those with a&#xD;
      morning preference and sufficient sleep time. Evening-type circadian preferences are&#xD;
      indirectly related to food addiction. Individuals with the evening chronotype tend to have&#xD;
      higher BMI and unhealthy eating habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although a direct link between chronotype and obesity has not yet been demonstrated, based on&#xD;
      the negative health consequences in evening chronotypes; In this study, it is assumed that&#xD;
      success in obesity management will increase with well-timed circadian / sleep cycles,&#xD;
      adequate sleep time and quality sleep in obese individuals with evening chronotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, in this study, it was aimed to examine the effect of circadian timing program&#xD;
      created for obese individuals with evening chronotype on obesity management and sleep&#xD;
      quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in an experimental design, in a randomized controlled manner, in&#xD;
      accordance with its purpose. The universe of the study will be obese individuals followed in&#xD;
      Kocaeli University Hospital Obesity Outpatient Clinic. As a result of the power analysis&#xD;
      performed to determine the sample size, the number of individuals in each group was&#xD;
      determined as n = 18. The sample of the study will be 36 individuals in total. Participants&#xD;
      will be selected to the intervention and control groups by simple randomization method.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Body Mass Index (BMI) from Baseline at 12 Week</measure>
    <time_frame>Change between day 1 and week 12 of the study.</time_frame>
    <description>Measurements will be made with body analysis device and height meter in the outpatient clinic. The Body-Mass Index is calculated by dividing the person's weight in kilograms by the square of the person's height in meters (kg / m²). Change = (Week 12 Measurement- Baseline Measurement).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Waist-Hip Ratio (WHR) from Baseline at 12 Week</measure>
    <time_frame>Change between day 1 and week 12 of the study.</time_frame>
    <description>Waist and hip circumference is measured with a tape measure, graduated in centimetres, . The waist-hip ratio is calculated as waist measurement divided by hip measurement W ÷ H. Change = (Week 12 Measurement- Baseline Measurement).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Sleep Quality on The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PUKI) at Week 12.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>PUKI is a scale that can define the quality of sleep as &quot;good or bad&quot;. Change = (Week 12 Measurement- Baseline Measurement).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Quality of Life from Baseline at 12 Week.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>In the Impact of Weight on Quality of Life Instrument (IWQOL-Lite) the lowest score that can be obtained from the scale is 0, and the highest score is 100. According to the scale scoring; The lower the score, the lower the quality of life, and the higher the score, the higher the quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Change in Sleepiness from Baseline at 12 Week.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>In the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) the lowest score that can be obtained from the scale is 0, and the highest score is 24. ESS scores of 11-24 represent increasing levels of 'excessive daytime sleepiness' (EDS).</description>

    <description>Obese individuals with evening chronotype will be trained on sleep hygiene in order to create behavioral changes in line with circadian rhythms and an intervention program called &quot;Circadian Timing Program&quot; which was created by the researcher in line with the relevant literature will be implemented for 12 weeks. This program includes sleep hygiene recommendations and regulation of daylight exposure, sleep, meal, caffeine intake and exercise times. To determine participants' sleep times they will be asked to keep a sleep diary and sleep records will be taken with the smart bracelet. Participants will be given a password to access the research website. The website of the study will be used for the training, control, motivation and communication of the Participants.</description>
