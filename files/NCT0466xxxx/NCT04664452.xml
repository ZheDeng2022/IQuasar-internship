  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Porcine derived products are being used as biological grafts in mainly in orthopedic surgery,&#xD;
      neurosurgery, cardiovascular surgery and general surgery. It is well known that consuming&#xD;
      pork or porcine products are prohibited in some religions or divisions of religions. It may&#xD;
      be a tender point for patients undergoing surgery in which porcine derived products are&#xD;
      utilized.In this survey study we aimed to determine the level of awareness and perception of&#xD;
      surgeons with an international anquette. The study will also reveal the choices of surgeons&#xD;
      about this issue both in elective and emergency procedures&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the survey study an online anquette form will be sent through online surgery networks both&#xD;
      professional and social media. The questionnaire will not include questions defining the&#xD;
      responders individually. The questions are related to frequency of utilization of porcine&#xD;
      derived products in surgery, surgeons' level of awareness about utilization of porcine&#xD;
      products, surgeons' level of religiousity and surgeons' choices about porcine derived product&#xD;
      utilization and consent of patients. After collection of responses the data will be analyzed&#xD;
      to discover current status of porcine derived surgical product utilization and surgeons'&#xD;
      perception about the issue. The anquette will be distributed worldwide to surgeons in&#xD;
      different branches of surgery. Literature seems to be lacking of that kind of study&#xD;
