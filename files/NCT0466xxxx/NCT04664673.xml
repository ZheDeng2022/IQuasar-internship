These metrics (ranging from 0 to 1, no unit) are measured non-invasively via brain MRI using the Distribution of 3D Anisotropic Microstructural environments in Diffusion-compartment imaging (DIAMOND) model combined with a Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI) sequence. The results reflects the overall heterogeneity of the fibers, with zero representing more homogeny structures, hence less dispersion of the fibers.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-III)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 3 weeks and 13 weeks after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The WAIS-III provided scores for Verbal intelligence quotient (IQ), Performance IQ, and Full Scale IQ, along with four secondary indices (Verbal Comprehension, Working Memory, Perceptual Organization, and Processing Speed). The six Verbal Scale (Vocabulary, Similarities, Arithmetic, Digit Span, Information, and Comprehension) and five Performance Scale (Picture Completion, Digit Symbol (Coding), Block Design, Matrix Reasoning, and Picture Arrangement) subtests are combined to calculate the Full Scale IQ. After each subtest is scored, raw point totals are converted to scaled scores according to the examinee's age range (mean= 10; standard deviation=3). Sums of scaled scores then are computed separately for the six Verbal Scale subtests, five Performance Scale subtests, and all 11 subtests which constitute the Full Scale. The sums are converted to deviation IQs. The IQs generated have a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15 at all age levels.</description>
