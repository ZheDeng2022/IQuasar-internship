    <textblock>
      The objectives of this research study are to determine the frequency of low synovitis scores&#xD;
      by ultrasound in patients with RA in moderate or high disease activity and to compare&#xD;
      physician treatment recommendations for patients before versus after receiving ultrasound&#xD;
      results. Participants will answer questionnaires about their disease activity and complete a&#xD;
      musculoskeletal ultrasound in accordance with the study procedures.&#xD;

      The purpose of this research study is to determine whether ultrasound technology can improve&#xD;
      treatment decisions for patients with rheumatoid arthritis who have elevated disease activity&#xD;
      scores. To do so, the investigators will be evaluating rheumatoid arthritis patients with&#xD;
      moderate to high disease activity and how ultrasound scans can reveal any new information&#xD;
      about the severity of their arthritis. Patients will answer questionnaires to gauge their&#xD;
      disease activity as well as the depression, fatigue, and pain they experience as a result of&#xD;
      their arthritis. The patients will then undergo an ultrasound examination to evaluate their&#xD;
      synovitis levels, which will then be made available to their physician. Physicians will be&#xD;
      asked about their disease activity assessments and treatment recommendations before and after&#xD;
      ultrasounds are performed.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This single-arm pilot interventional study will evaluate the potential for ultrasound to improve disease activity assessments for patients with rheumatoid arthritis with clinical scores indicating moderate or high disease activity. Patient facing measures including the Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data (RAPID)3 and the Clinical Disease Activity (CDAI) will be used to determine patient disease activity, as well as whether patients are eligible for the study. The investigators will also collect inflammatory marker levels (including C-reactive protein) and ultrasound assessment to determine severity of illness and for physicians to determine treatment recommendations. Additional patient information will be obtained via chart reviews, and providers will complete pre- and post-ultrasound assessments of the patients.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>This proportion of patients will be determined at the completion of the study, after approximately two years.</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome variable is the proportion of patients with low synovitis scores, which will be determined by the ultrasound assessment. These scores will also be compared to other measures of disease activity. The investigators will be using the EULAR-OMERACT combined scoring system for grading synovitis in rheumatoid arthritis. Each joint is scored from 0-3 with higher scores indicating higher inflammatory activity. Patients with scores of 1 or below in all measured joints are considered to have low synovitis scores.</description>

    <time_frame>This total number will be calculated after all patients have completed study procedures, about two years</time_frame>

             arthritis. They must be undergoing treatment with a disease-modifying anti-rheumatic&#xD;
             drug, and their Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) must be greater than 10 while&#xD;
             their swollen joint count must be less than or equal to two.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with evidence of large joint (knee, hip, shoulder, elbow) disease activity,&#xD;
             including warmth and swelling, and patients who have had a joint MRI or&#xD;
             musculoskeletal ultrasound in the past 3 months will not be eligible to participate in&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
