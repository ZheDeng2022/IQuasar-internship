      Establish a cardiovascular biomarker profile to help screening for congenital heart disease&#xD;
      in infants and children as well as use non-invasive cardiac imaging in combination with such&#xD;
      profiling to better predict the need for future cardiac interventions such as open heart&#xD;
      surgery or cardiac catheter intervention selected types of with congenital heart disease.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Analyzing circulating cardiovascular biomarkers using blood samples should improve&#xD;
      identification of congenital heart disease in newborns, in particular for those needing&#xD;
      future cardiac interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparing such biomarker profiles and non-invasive cardiac imaging results over time in&#xD;
      infants and children should lead to better understanding of the complex cardiovascular&#xD;
      remodeling processes in common congenital heart lesions such as atrial or ventricular septal&#xD;
      defects. This in turn should lead to an improved risk factor assessment model to guide&#xD;
      treatment decisions in children with congenital heart disease in the foreseeable future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test our hypothesis, that cardiovascular biomarker profiling and non-invasive cardiac&#xD;
      imaging findings in infants and children with congenital heart disease, differs from healthy&#xD;
      controls, we will assess controls at enrolment and follow cases with predefined congenital&#xD;
      heart disease lesions over a maximum of three years or up till one year after open heart&#xD;
      surgery / cardiac catheter intervention to correct such lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants and children resident in designated healthcare regions of Sweden will be invited to&#xD;
      participate after study advertisement. Written informed consent will be obtained from legal&#xD;
      guardians and assent will be sought from children who can communicate verbally with the&#xD;
      dedicated paediatric research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy subjects 0-17 years at enrolment will undergo standard electrocardiogram (ECG),&#xD;
      echocardiography and blood sampling to evaluate the heart's anatomy and function and to&#xD;
      obtain samples for subsequent biomarker analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, saliva will be sampled and/or neonatal blood samples from national biobank&#xD;
      storage will be retrieved for comparison with cardiovascular biomarker profiles in these&#xD;
      controls if available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate these cardiovascular assessments in predefined age groups, a subgroup of these&#xD;
      participating subjects will be asked to complete additional cardiac magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging based on study protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incidental findings will be followed up according to standard care protocols in designated&#xD;
      paediatric cardiology clinics throughout the participating healthcare regions in Sweden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cases of congenital heart disease that lead to pulmonary over-circulation, such as atrial and&#xD;
      ventricular septal defects, partial anomalous pulmonary venous drainage, aort-pulmonary&#xD;
      windows and patent ductus arterious, will be asked to participate if the lesion has not been&#xD;
      treated by open heart surgery or cardiac catheter interventions at enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with these predefined types of congenital heart disease aged 0-17 years at enrolment&#xD;
      will undergo standard electrocardiograms (ECG), echocardiography and blood sampling to assess&#xD;
      biomarkers at baseline and at 6-12 month follow-up intervals in dedicated paediatric&#xD;
      cardiology clinics over a maximum period of three years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saliva samples and/or cardiovascular tissue obtained during open heart surgery may also be&#xD;
      analysed for studied cardiovascular biomarkers. Additionally, neonatal blood samples from&#xD;
      national biobank storage will be retrieved for comparison with current biomarker profiles if&#xD;
      available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For those congenital heart disease cases referred for open heart surgery or cardiac catheter&#xD;
      intervention to correct the congenital heart lesion based on standard care assessment&#xD;
      decisions during the study period, follow-up will end one year after such intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate these cardiovascular assessments in predefined age groups, a subgroup of&#xD;
      participating cases will be asked to complete additional cardiac magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      based on study protocols.&#xD;
