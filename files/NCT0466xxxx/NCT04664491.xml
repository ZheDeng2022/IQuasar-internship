  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, parallel-group,cluster randomised trial involving secondary hospitals&#xD;
      across China. The objective is to evaluate the effect of COPD on reducing moderate-to-severe&#xD;
      exacerbations during 12 months follow-up in primary-level medical institutions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COPD is the most common chronic respiratory disease in China and has caused significant&#xD;
      economic and disease burden. An effective and standardized condition management strategy is&#xD;
      urgently needed to reduce the incidence of acute exacerbation, improve the quality of&#xD;
      patients' life, and avoid premature death caused by COPD. At present, management of COPD is&#xD;
      mainly conducted in community-level health institutions. Implementing standardized management&#xD;
      of COPD in primary care will help improve the level of COPD prevention and treatment in&#xD;
      China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will carry out a multicenter, adjudicator-blinded, parallel, cluster randomized clinical&#xD;
      trial, involving 96 secondary hospitals across the country. Each hospital enrolls 36 patients&#xD;
      with COPD. The hospitals will be randomly allocated into standardized management (SM) group&#xD;
      and control group. In SM group, standardized COPD management based-on guidelines will be&#xD;
      delivered to patients, including inhaler use for initial and maintenance therapy, regular&#xD;
      follow-up, long-term monitoring of lung function and respiratory symptoms, patient education,&#xD;
      and favorable lifestyle changes. In control group, patients will receive routine care as&#xD;
      usual. In both groups, moderate and severe exacerbations will be collected within 12 months&#xD;
      follow-up after randomization. Group difference in annual exacerbation rate will be examined&#xD;
      to evaluate the effect of standardized management of COPD on acute exacerbation of COPD in&#xD;
      primary care.&#xD;

    <description>In standardized management group, patients will receive a multifaceted and integrated disease management that follows recommendations in GOLD 2020 and China Guideline on COPD care. It contains the components below.&#xD;
Maintenance therapy after initial treatment. In this study, patients' initial therapy is the prescribed inhalers at baseline. Maintenance therapy is the medications (LABA, LAMA, or ICS) prescribed for regular or long-term use after initial therapy.&#xD;
Long-term follow-up and routine monitoring of symptoms measured by CAT, mMRC and SGRQ.&#xD;
Regular pulmonary function testing for lung function monitoring&#xD;
Strengthened COPD education&#xD;
Behavioral modification, eg. encouragement of influenza/pneumococcal vaccination, providing smoking cessation counseling and pulmonary rehabilitation.</description>
