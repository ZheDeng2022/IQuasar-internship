  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      JTX-8064-101 is a Phase 1, open label, dose escalation and dose expansion clinical study to&#xD;
      determine the safety, tolerability, and recommended Phase 2 dose of JTX-8064 alone and in&#xD;
      combination with a PD-1 inhibitor (PD-1i).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      JTX-8064 is a humanized mAb designed to block the interaction of LILRB2 with its known&#xD;
      ligands, endogenous major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) molecules. This is a&#xD;
      Phase 1, first in human, open label, multicenter, dose escalation and dose expansion clinical&#xD;
      trial to determine the safety, tolerability, MTD and RP2D of JTX-8064 when administered as a&#xD;
      single agent and in combination with a PD-1i in adult subjects with advanced refractory solid&#xD;
      tumor malignancies. Additionally, the study will seek to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of JTX-8064, and preliminary efficacy of JTX-8064 as a monotherapy and in&#xD;
      combination with a PD-1i.&#xD;

                  palliation) radiation therapy is allowed prior to and during study drug&#xD;
                  administration as long as there are no acute toxicities, any AE due to prior&#xD;
                  radiation therapy has recovered to &lt; Grade 2, and the radiation is not&#xD;
                  administered to a target lesion&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Symptomatic or uncontrolled brain metastases, leptomeningeal disease, or spinal cord&#xD;
