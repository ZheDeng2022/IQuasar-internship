      Xla1 Christensenella minuta, phase I, randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind protocol,&#xD;
      evaluating safety, tolerability and impact on the gut microbiota in healthy volunteers,&#xD;
      overweight and obese adults. This study is designed as a FIH, Phase I, daily oral single&#xD;

      following introduction of Xla1 performed in 2 parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 1: An open phase in normal weight healthy volunteers (HV) receiving all Xla1.&#xD;
&#xD;

      Xla1 Christensenella minuta, phase I, randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind protocol,&#xD;
      evaluating safety, tolerability and impact on the gut microbiota in healthy volunteers,&#xD;
      overweight and obese adults. This study is designed as a FIH, Phase I, daily oral single&#xD;
      dose, clinical trial evaluating safety, tolerability and the impact on the gut microbiota&#xD;

           obese (stage 1) adult patients receiving either Xla1 or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following objectives will be addressed in the program: 1) the primary objective of the&#xD;
      study is to assess the safety and tolerability of Xla1 in Healthy adult Volunteers (HV) [part&#xD;
      1], and, subsequently, in overweight and Stage I obese adults [part 2]. 2) the secondary&#xD;
      objectives comprise additional evaluation of the effects of Xla1 on subject's intestinal&#xD;
      microbiome ecology and evaluation of the engraftment of Xla1 in the gastrointestinal tract&#xD;
      (GIT).&#xD;
