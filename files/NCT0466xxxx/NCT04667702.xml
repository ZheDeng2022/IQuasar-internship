  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For the identified groups of patients (survivors of childhood cancer and youth with sickle&#xD;
      cell disease) the investigators want to better understand the barriers to, and facilitators&#xD;
      of, HPV vaccination. Through HCP interviews the investigators will also assess both&#xD;
      attitudinal and logistical obstacles to HPV vaccination. Some subspecialty HCPs may believe,&#xD;
      for instance, that it is the primary care provider's responsibility to vaccinate or they may&#xD;
      be unfamiliar with the requirement to enter vaccination data into CHIRP. Also, in some cases&#xD;
      HPV vaccine may not be readily available in subspecialty clinic locations and/or subspecialty&#xD;
      HCPs may not be Vaccines for Children (VFC) providers. Participants: the investigators will&#xD;
      focus on two patient groups: survivors of childhood cancer, which includes children aged 9-21&#xD;
      years who have completed active therapy for cancer and are eligible for vaccination, and&#xD;
      sickle cell disease, which includes children aged 9-21 years with a diagnosis of sickle cell&#xD;
      disease. The investigators will recruit parents of children aged 9-21 years and older&#xD;
      adolescents aged 18-21 years. For pediatric patients, the investigators selected a lower age&#xD;
      of 9 years because HPV vaccine is licensed down to 9 years of age, and an upper limit of 21&#xD;
      years, as that is considered the upper bound of adolescence by the American Academy of&#xD;
      Pediatrics. For patients 9-17 years of age, only parents will be interviewed by video or&#xD;
      phone because parents are the vaccine decision-makers. For patients 18-21 years of age, the&#xD;
      investigators will interview both young adults and their parents, because, while the young&#xD;
      adult has legal decision-making capacity, in reality, the decision is frequently made jointly&#xD;
      by the young adult and parent, and older adolescents are frequently unwilling to go against&#xD;
      their parents' wishes. All research procedures will be conducted in English. Participants&#xD;
      will be excluded if they have an intellectual disability or severe medical illness such that&#xD;
      they are unable to consent or to understand the questions.&#xD;
