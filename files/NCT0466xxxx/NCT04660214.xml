  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this trial is to evaluate two devices used in the treatment of Zenker&#xD;
      Diverticulum using flexible endoscopy (LigaSure and SB-knife). Analyze the technical success,&#xD;
      clinical success, relapses, complications, and the mean procedure time with each device&#xD;
      prospectively in order to transfer objective and uniform results to routine clinical&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;

      Patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be randomized on the day of the procedure using&#xD;
      a computer system that generates a table of random numbers, to perform endoscopic&#xD;
      diverticulotomy using a LigaSure device (LS 1500, Covidien; Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA)&#xD;
      or with Stag Beetle (SB) knife standard (Sumitomo Bakelite Co. Tokyo, Japan).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prophylactic intravenous antibiotic therapy is administered prior to the procedure and will&#xD;
      be performed under deep sedation with control by an endoscopist or anesthesiologist in the&#xD;
      cases indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gastroscopy will be performed to identify Zenker's diverticulum, and isolate the septum under&#xD;
      endoscopic control using a diverticuloscope or flexible overtube (ZD overtube, ZDO 22/30 Cook&#xD;
      Medical), after placing a guide (0.035 &quot;, 450 cm Jagwire, Boston Scientific, Natick MA, USA)&#xD;
      in the esophageal lumen. The overtube has two leaflets at one of its ends, a longer one that&#xD;
      is placed in the esophageal lumen and the short leaflet is placed in the diverticulum. In&#xD;
      those cases in which it is not possible to place the diverticuloscope, the septum will be&#xD;
      isolated with the help of a cap on the end of the endoscope. In these cases, the device used&#xD;
      will always be the SB-Knife since it is not possible to use the LigaSure and they will be&#xD;
      excluded from the study analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time of the procedure will be counted from when the overtube is placed until it is&#xD;
      removed after diverticulotomy.&#xD;
