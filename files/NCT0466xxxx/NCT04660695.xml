  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastric outlet obstruction in malignant disease appears when the tumor affects the&#xD;
      gastroduodenal area, precluding the passage of food into the small bowel. This condition&#xD;
      severely affects the quality of life. In patients with unresectable tumors, there are various&#xD;
      available treatments:a surgical bypass connecting the stomach to the small bowel, placing a&#xD;
      stent through the tumor to widen the passage and creating a gastrointestinal bypass with a&#xD;
      lumen apposing metal stent. These stents are deployed with an echoendoscope, which allows to&#xD;
      identify a small bowel loop and to deploy the stent, connecting the small bowel and the&#xD;
      stomach. This is called a EUS-guided gastroenterostomy (EUS-GE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EUS-GE is a rather novel procedure. Various techniques to create EUS-GE have been proposed.&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will retrieve data from the procedure and during the thirty&#xD;
      following days from consecutive patients undergoing an EUS-GE. The objectives of the study&#xD;
      are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To perform a detailed step by step description of the nasobiliary drain assisted EUS-GE&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the adverse events encountered&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the proportion of clinical and technical success&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess its impact on the patients' quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the evolution of the oral intake during the first month after the procedure&#xD;

      DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective multicenter case series&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary aim To describe the proportions of technical and clinical success. To describe&#xD;
      different variants in the nasobiliary drain assissted EUS-GE technique, offering a detailed&#xD;
      step by step description of the procedure performance by different endoscopists&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To describe the adverse encountered, their severity according to ASGE standards and their&#xD;
      management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To describe the time elapsed between the procedure and the initial oral intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To describe the evolution of the oral intake during the first month after the procedure To&#xD;
      assess the impact of the operators experience on procedure times, adverse events and&#xD;
      technical issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the impact of the procedure on the quality of life of the participating patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      All consecutive patients over 18 years of age receiving a nasobiliary drain assisted EUS-GE&#xD;
      for unresectable malignant GOO are eligible to participate in this study. Patients with a&#xD;
      previous gastroduodenal surgery, a previous endoscopic or surgical treatment for GOO, a&#xD;
      simultaneous malignant biliary obstruction requiring endoscopic treatment, a distal bowel&#xD;
      obstruction, ascites grade 2 or superior, uncorrectable coagulation disorders (INR&gt;1,5) or&#xD;
      severe thrombocytopenia (&lt;50000 platelets/mm3). or unable to understand the questionnaires&#xD;
      will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      At inclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent will be obtained. A clinical interview and a physical examination will be&#xD;
      performed. TheEuropean Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QoL Questionnaire&#xD;
      Core 30 (EORTC-QLQ-C30), which includes 30 items covering a global health status scale, five&#xD;
      functional scales and ten symptom scales will be assessed in a telephone interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopic procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      All procedures will be performed under sedation. An assistant endoscopist or research nurse&#xD;
      will retrieve all data regarding the procedure. Firstly, un upper digestive endoscopy is&#xD;
      performed with a conventional gastroscope. A guidewire is passed through the malignant lesion&#xD;
      causing the gastric outlet obstruction. Once the guidewire is located in the distal&#xD;
      duodenum/proximal jejunum, a nasobiliary drain (Nasal Biliary Drainage Sets, Cook medical,&#xD;
      Indiana) is advanced over the guidewire until its distal end is placed in the distal&#xD;
      duodenum/jejunum. At this point the gastroscope is substituted by a therapeutic&#xD;
      echoendoscope. With the echoendoscope in place, the target bowel loop is filled with saline&#xD;
      combined with methilene blue and radiopaque contrast. The echoendoscope is used to identify&#xD;
      the target bowel loop. AFter identifying the target, a lumen apposing metal stent (Axios,&#xD;
      Boston Scientific, Massachusetts) is deployed across the gastric and bowel using its&#xD;
      electrocautery enhanced deployment device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post procedure: Oral liquid intake can be restarted 4h after the procedure in patients&#xD;
      presenting no signs or symptoms suggesting any adverse event. Pacients with an adequate&#xD;
      tolerance might be discharged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical telephone interviews by an experienced research nurse will be held via telephone&#xD;
      calls 1 day, 7 days and 30 days after the procedure. Oral intake and adverse events will be&#xD;
      assessed every visit. Thirty days after the procedure a second evaluation of the&#xD;
      EORTC-QLQ-C30 will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Categorical variables were reported as percentages. Normally distributed continuous variables&#xD;
      were reported as the mean with the standard deviation values. Non-normally distributed&#xD;
      continuous variables were reported as the median and interquartile range. The EORTC QLQ-C30&#xD;
      descriptive analysis was performed with a specifically programmed Stata command (10).&#xD;
      Variables regarding the procedure step by step analysis will only undergo a descriptive&#xD;
      analysis. Differences between the different outcomes of the EORTC-QLQ-C30 will be assessed&#xD;
      using linear mixed models with fixed effects for baseline values, and interaction with&#xD;
      oncological treatment. The statistical analysis will be performed using the Stata package&#xD;
      (StataCorp. 2013, College Station, Texas).&#xD;
