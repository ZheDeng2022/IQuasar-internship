  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polypharmacy has the potential to harm older adults by causing cognitive impairment, falls,&#xD;
      and hospitalisations. Many adverse drug reactions could be prevented with closer monitoring.&#xD;
      This project will establish the effectiveness of the nurse-led intervention - the ADRe&#xD;
      Profile - for medicines commonly prescribed in primary care and evaluate intervention&#xD;
      implementation in general practices.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The number of medicines people take is increasing. Older adults are particularly at risk of&#xD;
      adverse drug reactions due to polypharmacy. Adverse drug reactions cause avoidable patient&#xD;
      harm, and around 5-8% of unplanned hospital admissions in the UK, costing the NHS £1.5-2.5bn&#xD;
      pa. Many adverse drug reactions could be prevented with closer monitoring. The nurse-led&#xD;
      Adverse Drug Reactions Profile (ADRe Profile) represents a unique instrument that records&#xD;
      patients' observations and self-reported information on signs and symptoms that is likely to&#xD;
      relate to an adverse reaction to medications. This project will establish the effectiveness&#xD;
      of ADRe Profile in identifying patient problems possibly resulting from medicines in general&#xD;
      practices and will be implemented in 3 phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 (4 months) Validity and reliability testing of the ADRe Profile will be performed&#xD;
      with key stakeholders (patients, nurses, care assistants, GP's and pharmacists), before&#xD;
      introducing the tool to general practices. Feasibility testing will also be undertaken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 (12 months) The aim of this phase is to test whether the ADRe Profile identifies and&#xD;
      ameliorates health problems. The practice nurse (or the researcher) will perform an ADRe&#xD;
      consultation with a group of eligible service users and compare the number and nature of&#xD;
      health and well-being problems identified with a similar group of service users who receive&#xD;
      normal care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3 (6 months) Finally, to further explore the impact of the ADRe Profile, the&#xD;
      researchers will conduct semi-structured interviews with health professionals (nurses, care&#xD;
      assistants, GPs and pharmacists) and service users.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hope that this study will help patients gain maximum benefits from their&#xD;
      medicines and support nurses, pharmacists and GP's to reduce any bothersome side effects and&#xD;
      problems that, if not addressed promptly, can lead to hospital admissions.&#xD;
