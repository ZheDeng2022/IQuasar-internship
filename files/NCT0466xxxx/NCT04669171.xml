      The purpose of this study is to define the recommended Phase 2 Dose, safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      immunogenicity, and preliminary efficacy of EO2463 during monotherapy and in combination with&#xD;
      lenalidomide and/or rituximab in patients with indolent NHL&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      EO2463 Is an innovative cancer peptide therapeutic vaccine based on the homologies between&#xD;
      tumor associated antigens and microbiome-derived peptides that will be administered alone and&#xD;
      in combination with lenalidomide, rituximab, and lenalidomide/rituximab to generate safety&#xD;
      and preliminary efficacy data in patients with indolent NHL&#xD;
