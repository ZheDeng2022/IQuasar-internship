  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To establish a follow-up cohort of antiretroviral therapy(ART) for patients with HIV/AIDS, to&#xD;
      observe the ART efficacy and adverse reactions, complications in the process of ART, as well&#xD;
      as mortality and causes of death, so as to provide basis for further improving ART efficacy&#xD;
      and quality of life of the patients.&#xD;

      1. To establish a follow-up cohort of ART for HIV/AIDS patients: follow-up points: before&#xD;
           treatment and 1, 2, 3 months after treatment, and every 3 months after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To observe the ART efficacy and adverse reactions: The clinical manifestations,&#xD;
           laboratory and auxiliary examination indexes of each follow-up time point was observed&#xD;
           in the follow-up cohort, including blood routine, liver function, renal function, blood&#xD;
           lipid, blood glucose, urine routine, plasma HIV RNA,CD4 cell count, hepatitis index and&#xD;
           syphilis index, etc. If HIV RNA is more than 1000 copies/ml, after treatment for more&#xD;
           than 6 months, peripheral blood 10ml should be retained and drug resistance should be&#xD;
           detected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To investigate the complications of HIV/AIDS patients before and after ART.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To investigate the mortality and causes of death in patients with HIV/AIDS.&#xD;

    <measure>The rate of virological suppression after antiretroviral therapy.</measure>
    <time_frame>Year 10</time_frame>
    <description>After ART, HIV RNA level in plasma were quantified every year. The rate of HIV-RNA&lt;400 copies/ml will be used to evaluate the efficacy of ART and the variation tendency of the rate of virological suppression will be described.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The CD4+T cell counts after ART.</measure>
    <time_frame>Year 10</time_frame>
    <description>The CD4+T cell count in plasma were detected every 3 months. The variation tendency of CD4+Tcell count will be described.</description>

    <description>Describe the all-cause mortality among HIV/AIDS after ART and analyze the trend.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The incidence of adverse reactions after ART.</measure>
    <time_frame>Year 10</time_frame>
    <description>In order to assess the adverse reactions after ART, the clinical symptoms were recorded, such as respiratory symptoms, digestive system symptoms, nervous system symptoms, and mental symptoms, etc. And cytological and biochemical indexes were detected such as blood routine, liver function, renal function, blood lipid, blood glucose, urine routine, etc. Calculate the incidence of adverse reactions after ART for 10 years.</description>
