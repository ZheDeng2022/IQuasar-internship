  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Contemporary cardiopulmonary rehabilitation programs often utilize cycling ergometer,&#xD;
      involving one-on-one heart rate monitoring by physiotherapists to ensure that patients reach&#xD;
      the target training intensity during training sessions. However, the process is frequently&#xD;
      described as monotonous and boring, resulting in early fatigue of therapists and patients as&#xD;
      well as poor compliance, leading to undertraining and suboptimal outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to test the feasibility of the &quot;Intelligent Cardiopulmonary Training System&#xD;
      (ICRS)&quot; and a novel indicator of measuring the adherence to training intensity. The ICRS was&#xD;
      developed with the idea to provide machine-based supervision on the user's heart rate during&#xD;
      training. It provides moderate-intensity continuous training with a cycling ergometer. This&#xD;
      system automatically adjusts the paddling resistance according to the user's real-time heart&#xD;
      rate, and helps to improve the user's adherence to pre-determined training intensity without&#xD;
      trainer's watch. The automation of intensity adjustment has its potential for conditions in&#xD;
      which supervision is not feasible.&#xD;

    <description>The intelligent cardiopulmonary rehabilitation system is designed to improve the user's adherence to pre-determined training intensity. The training intensity is pre-determined using the 60%-80% heart rate reserve which is obtained from the cardiopulmonary exercise test at prestest. The system allows dynamically auto-adjust the paddling resistance in accordance to the patient's current hear rate and paddling rate, with the goal to maintain the patient's heart rate at the pre-determined heart rate zone through the training period.</description>

    <description>Participants are required to wear a wristband heart rate monitor and exercise on a cycling ergometer-based ICRS for 30 minutes (5 minute of warm-up, 20 minutes of training followed by 5 minutes of cooldown). The target intensity for the 20-min training period is set at 60%~80% HRR determined in the pretest of cardiopulmonary exercise test.</description>
