  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the addition of a simple, scalable &quot;WASH kit&quot;, including household water&#xD;
      treatment products, a safe water storage container, and hygiene promotion, to the standard&#xD;
      national protocol for outpatient treatment of uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition among&#xD;
      children aged 6-59 months of age in northern Senegal.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) is defined as a weight-for-height z-score (WHZ) below -3 of&#xD;
      the World Health Organisation growth standards. It is a short-term acute condition with a&#xD;
      high case-fatality rate that increases both the susceptibility of children to infection and&#xD;
      the risk of mortality. The global prevalence of SAM in children is estimated to be over 17&#xD;
      million with most of those affected living in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Community-Based Management of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM) has significantly changed standard&#xD;
      practice for the treatment of SAM. Uncomplicated SAM cases are now predominantly managed on&#xD;
      an outpatient basis and Action Contre la Faim (ACF) supports outpatient treatment programs&#xD;
      (OTP) across the globe, particularly in Africa and Asia. This innovation has increased&#xD;
      coverage, and reduced the cost of treatment for both the health system and individuals.&#xD;
      However, under CMAM, the treatment context has moved from a more controlled health facility&#xD;
      setting to the generally less controlled household setting where the risk of infection due to&#xD;
      environmental hazards, such as contaminated water, may be higher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TISA trial described here will evaluate the effectiveness of combining a simple, scalable&#xD;
      &quot;WASH kit&quot; with OTP on the recovery rate among uncomplicated SAM cases aged 6-59 compared to&#xD;
      the national standard OTP. The WASH kit includes a plastic container, a supply of Aquatabs®&#xD;
      (effervescent chlorine tablets), and training in their use and associated hygiene practices.&#xD;
      The study is a cluster randomized controlled trial (cRCT), with health centres constituting&#xD;
      the clusters. Clusters are randomly allocated to either a control group receiving the&#xD;
      standard OTP or an intervention group receiving OTP plus the WASH kit. The primary outcome of&#xD;
      the trial is the recovery rate and the secondary outcomes are weight gain, referral rate,&#xD;
      longitudinal prevalence of diarrhoea, prevalence of enteric pathogen detection and all-cause&#xD;
      mortality.&#xD;
