        The data used for the analyses includes all patients aged ≥ 18 years with at least one&#xD;
        filled prescription of an oral targeted therapy relevant for treating mRCC registered in&#xD;
        the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register between July 1st 2005 (there is no data available in&#xD;
        the register before this date) and June 30th 2020. The Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical&#xD;
        (ATC) codes for the oral drugs relevant for treating mRCC are the following: L01XE04&#xD;
        (sunitinib), L01XE05 (sorafenib), L01XE11 (pazopanib), L01XE17 (axitinib), L01XE10&#xD;
        (everolimus), L01XE26 (cabozantinib), L01XE34 (tivozantib), L01XE29 (lenvatinib). The&#xD;
        patients identified in the PDR that also are identified in the SCR with the International&#xD;
        Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD)-7 diagnosis codes I800 or I809&#xD;
        and ICD-10 codes C64.0 and C64.9 from January 1st 2000 until December 31st 2019;excluding&#xD;
        ICD-7 code I801 (cancer of the renal pelvis) will be included in the analysis set.&#xD;
