    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective,multi-center,single arm,real world study to evaluate safety and&#xD;
      performance of Atezolizumab plus chemotherapy in patients with extensive-stage small-cell&#xD;
      lung cancer,and also to explore potential biomarkers for Immune-related Adverse Events.&#xD;

      In 2018,the results of IMpower 133 were reported on WCLC.Meanwhile,the data was published in&#xD;
      NEJM.Atezolizumab combined with carboplatin and etoposide for extensive stage small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer was recommended as the first by NCCN guidelines quickly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atezolizumab plus chemotherapy was approved by NMPA on Feb 13,2020,making Atezolizumab for 1L&#xD;
      ES-SCLC in China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Real world study can reflect the efficacy and safety of treatment in clinical practice.Based&#xD;
      on the research of public database,the prospective cohort study had been reported,but the&#xD;
      study based on Chinese patients still left weak point.&#xD;
