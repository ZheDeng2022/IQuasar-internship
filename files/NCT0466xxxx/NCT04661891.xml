  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop a real-time controller for exoskeletons using neural&#xD;
      information embedded in human musculature. This controller will consist of an online&#xD;
      interface that anticipates human movement based on high-density electromyography (HD-EMG)&#xD;
      recordings, and then translates it into functional assistance. This study will be carried out&#xD;
      in both healthy participants and participants post-stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers will develop an online algorithm (decoder) in currently existing exoskeletons&#xD;
      that can extract hundreds of motor unit (MU) spiking activity out of HD-EMG recordings. The&#xD;
      MU spiking activity is a train of action potentials coded by its timing of occurrence that&#xD;
      gives access to a representative part of the neural code of human movement. The researchers&#xD;
      will also develop a command encoder that can anticipate human intent (multi-joint position&#xD;
      and force commands) from MU spiking activity to translate the neural information to movement.&#xD;
      The researchers will integrate the decoder with the command encoder to showcase the real-time&#xD;
      control of multiple joint lower-limb exoskeletons.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The researchers will record muscle activity in healthy participants and participants&#xD;
      post-stroke from up to eight lower limb muscles (soleus, gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior,&#xD;
      rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, and hamstring) during functional tasks (e.g., single-joint&#xD;
      movement, gait, squatting, cycling). These measurements will provide the physiological&#xD;
      dataset of lower limb movement and locomotion for the neural decoder. Then, the researchers&#xD;
      will apply online deep learning methods for MU spiking activity decomposition from over eight&#xD;
      muscles, and develop a real-time neural decoder. This will provide real-time decomposition of&#xD;
      hundreds of MUs concurrently active during natural lower limb human behavior. The researchers&#xD;
      will validate this approach by comparing our results with a gold standard, the blind source&#xD;
      separation method. Blind source separation algorithms can separate or decompose the HD-EMG&#xD;
      signals, a convolutive mix of MU action potentials, into the times at which individual MUs&#xD;
      discharge their action potentials. With the decomposed MU spiking data, the researchers will&#xD;
      develop methods to translate MU spiking activity in position, force, and hybrid commands for&#xD;
      exoskeletons that will become a command encoder implemented into currently existing research&#xD;
      exoskeletons that can anticipate human intent (multi-joint position and force commands) to&#xD;
      estimate the level of assistance required by the task, (e.g., add knee torque during the&#xD;
      stance phase).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers will combine the MU spiking activity decoder with the subspace projection&#xD;
      methods into a neural real-time interface between individuals and a currently existing&#xD;
      research lower extremity exoskeleton for locomotion augmentation. This will become an&#xD;
      integrated high-resolution human-machine interface that can be used for real-time control of&#xD;
      exoskeletons so that commands will be delivered at a rate higher than the muscles'&#xD;
      electromechanical delay, i.e., the elapsed time between neural command and muscle force&#xD;
      generation of movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Experiment A, the investigators will recruit healthy volunteers (n = 10) and participants&#xD;
      post-stroke (n = 10) and complete single-joint movement and locomotor tasks to collect muscle&#xD;
      activity data via HD-EMG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Experiment B, the investigators will showcase the generalization of our approach&#xD;
      recruiting and interfacing healthy volunteers (n = 10) and participants post-stroke (n = 10)&#xD;
      with the assistive exoskeleton. Subjects will perform single-joint and locomotor tasks to&#xD;
      calibrate the decoder, and then repeat single-joint and locomotor tasks with the decoder&#xD;
      providing real-time assistance. Participants post-stroke will repeat up to 10 sessions to&#xD;
      evaluate the stability of the ability of the decoder to extract motor units.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in bilateral joint torque at the ankle, knee, and hip</measure>
    <time_frame>For Experiment B, change in joint torque at baseline and with assistive robot through participant completion, an average of 3 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Joint torque is the sum of passive and active torques of the human limb. Passive torques are produced by tension developed as muscle tissue, tendons, and ligaments are stretched. Active torque is the torque produced by the muscles. Typically lower joint torque during movement is a better outcome.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in impedance levels between exoskeleton and participant</measure>
    <time_frame>For Experiment B, change in impedance levels at baseline and with assistive robot through participant completion, an average of 3 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The researchers will compare the impedance (interactive force generated between the exoskeleton and participant) at bilateral hip, knee and ankle levels with and without real-time control assistance from the exoskeleton. Typically, a lower impedance is a better outcome as the movement of the exoskeleton and human is more synchronized.</description>

    <intervention_name>Isometric contractions</intervention_name>
    <description>HD-EMG grids will be applied to the lower limb muscles of interest. Isometric contractions will consist of applying joint torque to reach a pre-defined torque level based on the subject's maximal voluntary contraction (i.e., 25%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%). The participant will control torque intensity by responding to a biofeedback displayed on a screen. The joint will be secured with non-compliant bands to prevent any movement of the participant. The order of the joints tested (i.e., dominant ankle, knee, or hip joint) will be randomized.</description>
