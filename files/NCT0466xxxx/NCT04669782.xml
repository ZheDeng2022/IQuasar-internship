  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an interventional study on nutraceuticals. It is a randomized controlled, open-label,&#xD;
      prospective, single-center study that involves the enrollment of 82 patients with&#xD;
      osteoporosis and 41 subjects without osteoporosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis the decarboxylated form of Osteocalcin (OC), called GluOC, represents a&#xD;
      clinically useful marker for monitoring the effects of supplementation with vitamin K in&#xD;
      association with anabolic treatment with teriparatide will be analyzed not only on bone but&#xD;
      also on skeletal muscle and energy metabolism in patients with severe osteoporosis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      OC, also known as bone-Gla-protein (BGP), is the main non-collagen protein of the&#xD;
      extracellular matrix in mineralized tissues. It is synthesized by osteoblasts, odontoblasts,&#xD;
      and hypertrophic chondrocytes and, through its negative charges, binds calcium and regulates&#xD;
      the formation of hydroxyapatite crystals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In humans, circulating OC levels negatively correlate with fasting blood glucose and insulin,&#xD;
      Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), body mass index (BMI),&#xD;
      hyperlipidemia, and circulating concentrations of leptin. Weight loss (resulting from diet&#xD;
      and / or physical activity) improves metabolic profile and muscle strength and increases OC&#xD;
      levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It's interesting to note that high plasma levels of vitamin K or dietary supplementation&#xD;
      (MK-7, the natural derivative of vitamin K2), correlate with a reduction in the loss of bone&#xD;
      mass and quality. In addition, short-term (1 week) and long-term (3 years) vitamin K&#xD;
      supplementation improves insulin resistance in both young and old males and high vitamin K&#xD;
      consumption is associated with reduced insulin resistance and reduced risk of developing type&#xD;
      2 mellitus diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, it has been reported in mice that the combination of teriparatide (TPT) and vitamin&#xD;
      K is more effective than ionotherapy in improving bone formation, bone density and strength,&#xD;
      and in inhibiting bone resorption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the putative relevance of the decarboxylated form of OC, GluOC, in the endocrine&#xD;
      interaction between bone and organs responsible for the management of energy resources (e.g.&#xD;
      endocrine pancreas, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue) whose function is deregulated in&#xD;
      elderly subjects and in the syndrome of fragility, this study aims to define a role of&#xD;
      supplementation with vitamin K in osteoporosis, another condition characterizing the frailty&#xD;
      of the elderly, on the endocrine function of bone tissue and the consequent effects on energy&#xD;
      metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is various evidence regarding the usefulness of using the decarboxylated form of OC as&#xD;
      a biomarker for monitoring the response to anti-osteoporotic treatments. In particular, the&#xD;
      circulating levels of GluOC respond both to osteometabolic treatments (teriparatide) and to&#xD;
      supplementation with vitamin K, in a more relevant way than to total osteocalcin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes the following phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. enrollment of controls, after obtaining informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. enrollment of patients, after obtaining informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. randomization for the patient group&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. prescription teriparatide +/- Vitamin K depending on the group to which it belongs&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. re-evaluation of patients after 6, 12 and 18 months of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The group of patients randomized to the teriparatide + Vitamin K / Menaquinone MK-7 arm will&#xD;
      have to take MK-7 at a dose of 375 microg / day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with osteoporosis will be randomized 1: 1 to one of two treatment groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Teriparatide + Vitamin K&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Teriparatide&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomization list will be generated with SAS 9.4 software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary,&#xD;
      USA) and foresees the presence of blocks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis of the covariance will be performed to evaluate the effect of treatment with and&#xD;
      without vitamin K / MK-7 on the primary endpoint measured at 18 months, adjusting for its&#xD;
      baseline value (α = 0.05, two-tailed test). The results will also be described in terms of&#xD;
      means and 95% confidence intervals both of the absolute values of GluOC at 18 months and of&#xD;
      its variations from baseline. This approach will also be followed for the evaluation of the&#xD;
      effect of the intake of vitamin K / MK-7 on the secondary endpoints defined by the OC&#xD;
      isoforms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The association between GluOC and Gla-type Osteocalcin (GlaOC) levels at 18 months (and&#xD;
      changes from baseline) with respect to the markers of energy, bone and muscle metabolism&#xD;
      measured at 18 months will also be explored through a linear regression model.&#xD;
