  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Launched in April 2015 , Gym Tonic is the first of its kind cross-border exercise-as-medicine&#xD;
      partnership between research institutions, business enterprises and service providers from&#xD;
      Singapore and Finland. What sets Gym Tonic apart from other exercise programmes is its&#xD;
      singular focus on strength training, necessary for frailty prevention and maintenance of&#xD;
      functional independence for the elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized-control trial is to validate the Gym Tonic programme and data as well&#xD;
      measuring its effectiveness in improving physical functions and reversing frailty.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The RCT is conducted in 3 eldercare community centers. In each center, a group of elderly&#xD;
      will be randomly sorted into 2 groups. An intervention group and a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group will go through 12 weeks of Gym Tonic progressive training programme.&#xD;
      While the control group acts as a control. After the first 12 weeks, the intervention group&#xD;
      will be going through another 12 weeks of Gym Tonic maintenance programme, while the control&#xD;
      group will be going through the Gym Tonic progressive training programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements of physical functions, isometric strength and frailty will be conducted pre&#xD;
      trial, post 12 weeks and post 24 weeks.&#xD;
