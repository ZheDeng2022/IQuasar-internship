  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is to analyze the outcomes of the Alpena Otago Telehealth Program. The Alpena&#xD;
      Senior Citizens Center is implementing the Otago program, an evidence-based, 6-month, home&#xD;
      exercise program using live video chats in combination with an online exercise app, Blue&#xD;
      Marble. We will recruit seniors who are participants of the Alpena Otago Telehealth Program&#xD;
      to allow the study team to analyze their outcomes. The goal of the study is to examine the&#xD;
      feasibility and efficacy of a 6-month, home-based, Otago Telehealth program for seniors in&#xD;
      Alpena.&#xD;

    <measure>Fall Risk Questionnaire (FRQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Fall Risk Questionnaire (FRQ) is a self-reported questionnaire with 12 questions for fall risk factors. Each question is rated 0 for NO (negative) and 1 for YES (positive) for fall risk factor. The sum of scores from all questions is the test score. A FRQ score &gt;=4 indicates increased fall risk. Higher scores correspond to higher fall risk.</description>

    <measure>Activities-specific Balance Scale (ABC)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Activities-specific Balance Scale (ABC) is a self-reported questionnaire of balance confidence during daily activities with 16 items. Each item is rated from 0% (NO confidence) to 100% (Completely confident) on maintaining balance for a daily task. The average of scores from all items is the test score. An ABC score &lt;=67% indicates increased fall risk. Lower scores correspond to high worse balance confidence and higher fall risk.</description>

    <measure>Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>

    <measure>Program acceptance</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Program acceptance is a semi-structured questionnaire about the participant's satisfaction and acceptance of program. The participants rate their opinions about the expectation, easy of use, perceived benefits and effectiveness of the exercise program on a scale of 1 to 4 (1 = &quot;Strongly disagree&quot;, 2 = &quot;Disagree&quot;, 3 = &quot;Agree&quot;, 4= &quot;Strongly Agree&quot;). There are two open-questions about the frequency of exercise per week and suggestions for program improvement.</description>

    <description>A physical therapist will use video visits to evaluate the participants and provide exercise instructions from Week 1 to Week 4. Each participant will use the Blue Marble Health in Motion app from a mobile tablet to complete the exercise guided by an avatar at their own pace after receiving the exercise instructions from the physical therapist. Participants are encouraged to exercise three days a week and 30 minutes each day using the app for 6 months. The exercise protocol based on the evidence-based Otago program includes warm up, strengthening, and balance exercise.&#xD;
