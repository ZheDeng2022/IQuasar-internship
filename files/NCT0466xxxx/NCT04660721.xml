  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Study investigates a new product, sFilm-FS, aimed to help controlling body fluid leakage&#xD;
      in general surgery procedures, proposing its use as an adjunct to hemostasis and/or sealing.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many products have been developed as adjuncts to hemostasis in bleeding situations where&#xD;
      traditional methods such as suture, clips or energy-based coagulation are ineffective or&#xD;
      impractical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many products are not as effective in the presence of active and/or brisk bleeding since the&#xD;
      lack of sufficient adhesion strength allows forceful bleeding to simply &quot;float&quot; the products&#xD;
      away from the bleeding tissue, prior to the achievement of full hemostasis.&#xD;

      leakage in general surgery procedures, proposing its use as an adjunct to hemostasis and/or&#xD;
