      The study will consist of a treatment phase and follow-up phase. The treatment period is 12&#xD;
      months. Discontinuation of study treatment may occur earlier than 12 months for disease&#xD;
      recurrence, death, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent. Patients will be followed&#xD;
      for disease recurrence every 6 months and up to 24 months after the end of treatment (EOT)&#xD;
