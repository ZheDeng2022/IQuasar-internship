  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial investigates how well oleclumab and durvalumab work in treating patients&#xD;
      with sarcoma that has come back (recurrent) or does not respond to treatment (refractory) or&#xD;
      has spread to other places in the body (metastatic). Immunotherapy with monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies, such as oleclumab and durvalumab, may help the body's immune system attack the&#xD;
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the tumor response (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST]) at&#xD;
      4 months in patients with relapsed/refractory sarcoma. (Cohorts 1 and 2) II. To determine the&#xD;
      event-free survival (EFS) rate at 4 months after initiation of the treatment in patients with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory osteosarcoma receiving novel immunotherapeutic agents. (Cohort 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 12 weeks after initiation of the&#xD;
      treatment in patients with relapsed/refractory sarcoma receiving novel immunotherapeutic&#xD;
      agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate the tumor response (Immune-related Response Criteria [irRC] and RECIST) in&#xD;
      patients with relapsed/refractory sarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of receiving novel immunotherapeutic agents in&#xD;
      patients with relapsed/refractory sarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To estimate the median PFS and overall survival (OS) in patients with relapsed/refractory&#xD;
      sarcoma receiving novel immunotherapeutic agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine expression of biomarkers (including but not limited to CD73, PD-1 and PD-L1)&#xD;
      in pre &amp; post treatment (tx) samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Quantification and characterization of the immune infiltrate (and other histologic and&#xD;
      immunohistologic changes) from tissue samples prior to treatment initiation and post&#xD;
      treatment (biopsy at week 6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Identification/quantification of immunologic changes (CD4+, CD8+, Teff, Treg cells and&#xD;
      NK cells) in peripheral blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Determining an immunoscore based on baseline tumor sample (identification of molecular&#xD;
      response/resistance patterns/future therapy options).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive oleclumab intravenously (IV) over 1 hour every 2 weeks for 5 doses, then&#xD;
      every 4 weeks thereafter. Patients also receive durvalumab IV over 1 hour every 4 weeks.&#xD;
      Cycle repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, and then every 3&#xD;
      months for up to 5 years.&#xD;

             (i.e., bilateral salpingectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or complete hysterectomy) or&#xD;
             post-menopausal. Women will be considered post-menopausal if they have been&#xD;
             amenorrheic for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. The following&#xD;
             age-specific requirements apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women &lt; 50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have&#xD;

             version (v)5.0 grade 0 or 1 with the exception of alopecia and laboratory values&#xD;
             listed per the inclusion criteria. Subjects with irreversible toxicity that is not&#xD;
             reasonably expected to be exacerbated by any of the investigational products may be&#xD;
             included (e.g., hearing loss) after consultation with the medical monitor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 14 days prior to the first&#xD;
             of durvalumab or oleclumab. The following are exceptions to this criterion:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Intranasal, inhaled, topical steroids, or local steroid injections (e.g.,&#xD;
                  intra-articular injection)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Systemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses not to exceed 10 mg/day of&#xD;
                  prednisone or equivalent&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., computed&#xD;
                  tomography [CT] scan premedication)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of primary immunodeficiency, solid organ transplantation, or previous clinical&#xD;
             diagnosis of tuberculosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  True positive test results for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis B or&#xD;
             hepatitis C&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of live, attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of&#xD;
             investigational products (NOTE: Subjects, if enrolled, should not receive live vaccine&#xD;
             during the study and 180 days after the last dose of investigational products)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major surgery (as defined by the investigator) within 4 weeks or thoracotomy for&#xD;
             pulmonary metastases within 2 weeks prior to first dose of treatment or if still&#xD;
             recovering from prior surgery. Local surgery of isolated lesions for palliative intent&#xD;
             is acceptable&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other invasive malignancy, within 2 years except for noninvasive malignancies such as&#xD;
             cervical carcinoma in situ, non-melanomatous carcinoma of the skin or ductal carcinoma&#xD;
             in situ of the breast that has/have been surgically cured&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable&#xD;
             angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, active peptic ulcer disease or gastritis, or&#xD;
             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study&#xD;
             requirement, substantially increase risk of incurring adverse events (AEs) from&#xD;
             durvalumab or oleclumab, or compromise the ability of the subject to give written&#xD;
             informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator or sponsor, would interfere&#xD;
             with evaluation of the investigational product or interpretation of subject safety or&#xD;
             study results&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of pneumonitis (active within past 6 months) or interstitial&#xD;
