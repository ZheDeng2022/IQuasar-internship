  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The centre of the retina (macula) at the back of the eye contains cells that give us our&#xD;
      central vision that we use for reading and recognising faces. These cells can be damaged by a&#xD;
      disease called wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD), where new abnormal blood vessels&#xD;
      grow through the macula and leak fluid. This can affect vision. In some cases, wet AMD can&#xD;
      also cause a bleed under the macula, known as a submacular haemorrhage (SMH), which can lead&#xD;
      to marked and persistent loss of vision in the eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current standard treatment for wet AMD is to give injections containing 'anti-VEGF' drugs&#xD;
      into the eye. Anti-VEGF drugs reduce the leakage of fluid so that the macula can become dry&#xD;
      again and sight can improve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anti-VEGFs are also the current standard of care for SMH, mainly because there is no licensed&#xD;
      treatment for the SMH itself (patients with SMH were excluded from most wet AMD studies).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study therefore is to compare two treatments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Standard treatment for wet AMD (anti-VEGF injections).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Standard treatment above plus surgery. This study will find out if having surgery&#xD;
           alongside anti-VEGF injections can improve vision further over the current standard&#xD;
           treatment of anti-VEGF injections alone.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SMH is a rare but devastating complication of wet AMD. Untreated, SMH typically leads to&#xD;
      permanent and severe loss of vision, ranging from 6/30 (approximately 20% normal vision) to&#xD;
      only being able to perceive light versus dark (no useful vision).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no large, published, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating treatments for&#xD;
      SMH. Hence there is no widely-accepted treatment approach. Some patients are managed by&#xD;
      observation, others with drugs (anti-VEGF) injected into the eye, others with eye surgery&#xD;
      (vitrectomy, subretinal TPA, gas) and combinations thereof. From a regulatory perspective the&#xD;
      standard treatment is with anti-VEGF injections alone, since these are licensed for the&#xD;
      treatment of wet AMD (and there is no treatment licensed for SMH). This study will test the&#xD;
      hypothesis that surgery with anti-VEGF injections for SMH due to wet AMD is superior to the&#xD;
      current standard of treatment with anti-VEGF injections alone. The results will help guide&#xD;
      future clinical practice to maximise the visual outcomes for patients with SMH. Most&#xD;
      potential participants will present or be referred to the clinics of the investigators who&#xD;
      provide routine care for wet AMD. Referrals may arise from research networks, family&#xD;
      physicians, optometrists or ophthalmologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After confirming the diagnosis of SMH, informed consent will be obtained and potential&#xD;
      participants will be asked to sign a consent form. Following this, baseline screening will&#xD;
      occur, including a clinical examination and a series of vision tests to confirm eligibility&#xD;
      to take part in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once successfully screened, each participant will be randomly allocated to one of the two&#xD;
      study groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Standard current treatment with anti-VEGF injections: participants will be given their&#xD;
           first injection into the study eye at the screening/baseline visit, or otherwise within&#xD;
           a few days. Following this, each participant will receive another injection at month 1,&#xD;
           another at month 2 and thereafter one injection every two months until the end of the&#xD;
           study (month 12). Anaesthetic eye drops will be given to numb the eye before each&#xD;
           injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Standard current treatment with anti-VEGF injections plus surgery: participants will be&#xD;
           given their first injection into the study eye at the time of surgery and then all other&#xD;
           injections as per the schedule above. During the surgery, the clear gel (vitreous) that&#xD;
           fills the inside of the eye will be removed and a clot-busting drug (TPA) will be&#xD;
           injected into the eye to help break up the blood clot. The inside of the eye will then&#xD;
           be filled with gas to help push the dissolved clot away from the macula. Various options&#xD;
           for anaesthetic will be discussed with each participant before surgery, including (i)&#xD;
           local anaesthetic only, (ii) local anaesthetic with some sedation, to reduce any anxiety&#xD;
           or (iii) general anaesthetic so the participant is asleep during the surgery. If the&#xD;
           participant also has a cataract or is likely to develop one, the surgeon will discuss&#xD;
           the option of having cataract surgery as part of the same operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the surgery, participants will be asked to keep their heads forward, to enable the gas&#xD;
      bubble to move the blood clot away from the macula. This should be done for 50 minutes out of&#xD;
      every hour for the first five days. During the 10-minute breaks, participants will be&#xD;
      encouraged to move around and be active. At night, participants will be asked to sleep on the&#xD;
      side of the operated eye, i.e. with the operated eye lowest. The gas is expected to disappear&#xD;
      from the eye around 4-8 weeks after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who have had surgery will be instructed to return for follow up the day after&#xD;
      surgery and also one week later. All participants will also have a clinical examination at 6&#xD;
      and 12 months that will include tests of their vision. They will also attend regularly for&#xD;
      anti-VEGF injections: every month for the first three visits, then every two months until the&#xD;
      study is completed at month 12.&#xD;

        General&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Serious allergy to fluorescein or indocyanine green (ICG).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Hypersensitivity to alteplase (Actilyse), gentamicin, arginine, phosphoric acid,&#xD;
             polysorbate 80 or aflibercept (Eylea).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Stroke, transient ischaemic attack or myocardial infarction within 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Participation in another interventional study within 12 weeks of enrolment or planned&#xD;
             to occur during this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Women who are breast feeding, pregnant, or planning to become pregnant during the&#xD;
             clinical trial. Any sexually active women of childbearing potential must agree&#xD;
             continued abstinence from heterosexual intercourse or to use highly effective methods&#xD;
             of birth control for the duration up to 12 weeks post IMP administration. Men must&#xD;
             also agree to use a condom if their partner is of child bearing potential, even if&#xD;
             they have had a successful vasectomy. Females of childbearing potential are females&#xD;
             who have experienced menarche and are not surgically sterilised (e.g. hysterectomy or&#xD;
             bilateral salpingectomy) or post-menopausal (defined as at least 1 year since last&#xD;
             regular menstrual period). Highly effective methods of birth control are those with a&#xD;
             failure rate of &lt; 1% per year when employed consistently and correctly, eg. combined&#xD;
             (oestrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with&#xD;

             progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation via&#xD;
             oral, injectable, implantable, intrauterine device (IUD), or intrauterine&#xD;
             hormone-releasing system ( IUS); or vasectomised partner.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. International Normalised Ratio (INR) greater than 3.5, unless it is anticipated that&#xD;
             the INR can be brought below this level prior to vitrectomy, balancing the systemic&#xD;
             risks with those of intraocular haemorrhage.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Unwilling, unable, or unlikely to return for scheduled follow-up for the duration of&#xD;
             the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Any other condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, would prevent the&#xD;
             participant from granting informed consent or complying with the protocol, such as&#xD;
             dementia, mental illness, or serious systemic medical disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Study eye&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. SMH that is known or estimated to have been present for longer than 15 days, as&#xD;
             evidenced by history, pre-trial clinical documentation, or fundus appearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. SMH due to eye disease other than exudative AMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Current active proliferative diabetic retinopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Current intraocular inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Current ocular or periocular infection other than blepharitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Current or known former high myopia (&gt;6 dioptres).&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Aphakia.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Other current or pre-existing ocular conditions that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator, will preclude any improvement in BCVA following resolution of SMH, such&#xD;
             as severe central macular atrophy or fibrosis, dense amblyopia, macular hole involving&#xD;
             the fovea, or very poor BCVA prior to presentation with SMH (counting fingers or&#xD;
             worse).&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Inadequate pupillary dilation or significant media opacities, which will prevent&#xD;
             adequate clinical evaluation of the posterior segment or fundus imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Intraocular surgery within 12 weeks of enrolment except for uncomplicated cataract&#xD;
             surgery, which is permitted within 8 weeks of enrolment.&#xD;
