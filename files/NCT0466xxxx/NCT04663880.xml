  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double blind, cross-over study designed to determine the concentration&#xD;
      of airborne house dust mite allergen inducing bronchial response in asthmatic subjects&#xD;
      allergic to mite, during allergen exposures in the Alyatec environmental exposure chamber&#xD;
      (EEC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was also designed to validate the specificity of the asthmatic reaction induced by&#xD;
      exposure to airborne house dust mite allergen in Alyatec EEC.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Determine the concentration of HDM allergen (in ng/m3 of Der p1) necessary to induce a bronchial response in at least 60% of asthmatic subjects allergic to HDM</measure>
    <time_frame>10 hours: 4 hours of exposure in the EEC then 6 hours post-exposure.</time_frame>
    <description>The bronchial response is evaluated by measuring FEV1 value during EEC exposure.&#xD;
Early asthmatic response (EAR) occurs when a 20% drop in FEV1 is detected during the exposure compared to the pre-exposure FEV1.&#xD;
Late bronchial response (LAR) occurs when a 15% drop in FEV1 or 20% drop in peak flow is detected 1 to 6h after the EAR.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluate the safety of allergenic exposure in EEC</measure>
    <time_frame>28 hours: 4 hours of exposure in EEC then 24 hours post-exposure</time_frame>
    <description>Safety is assessed with clinical evaluations performed during the 4h of exposure in the EEC</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluate the metrology of the EEC</measure>
    <time_frame>4 hours of exposure in EEC</time_frame>
    <description>The metrology is assessed with the measure of allergen concentration and particules diameter thanks to sensors in the chamber.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluate the specificity of the bronchial response</measure>
    <time_frame>4 hours of exposure in EEC</time_frame>
    <description>The specificity of the bronchial response is assessed with the HDM exposure in the EEC of asthmatic subjects non allergic to HDM.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluate the effect of the exposure on rhinitis symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>28 hours: 4 hours of exposure in EEC then 24 hours post-exposure</time_frame>
    <description>The effect of the exposure on the rhinitis response is assessed with Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS).&#xD;
The TNSS was obtained from the sum of all four individual symptom scores, with a total possible score ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 12 (maximum symptom intensity).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluate the effect of the exposure on conjunctivitis symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>28 hours: 4 hours of exposure in EEC then 24 hours post-exposure</time_frame>
    <description>The effect of the exposure on the conjunctivitis response is assessed with Total Ocular Symptom Score (TOSS).&#xD;
The TOSS was obtained from the sum of all four individual symptom scores, with a total possible score ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 12 (maximum symptom intensity).</description>
