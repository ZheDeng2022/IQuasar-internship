    <textblock>
      Children aged 6 months to 12 years of age will be randomised to receive vitamin D 60,000IU&#xD;
      once a month for 3 months or a placebo. The vitamin D will be in form of granules supplied in&#xD;
      sachets. The primary study outcomes will be incidence of hospitalisation and change in&#xD;
      vitamin D levels following supplementation. Secondary outcomes will include incidence of&#xD;
      vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC), acute severe respiratory illness, Vitamin D related Severe&#xD;
      adverse events and requirements for blood transfusion&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      BACKGROUND: More than 75% of all children with sickle cell anemia (SCA) are born in&#xD;
      sub-Saharan Africa annually. The hallmark of SCA is haemolytic anaemia and or pain crisis&#xD;
      that often require hospitalisation. Interventions to reduce the complications, which are&#xD;
      prerequisites for frequent hospitalisations, are needed urgently. Vitamin D deficiency is&#xD;
      common in children with SCA and is associated with recurrent vaso-occlusive crisis, blood&#xD;
      transfusion, hospitalisation and infections. Routine vitamin D supplementation is not&#xD;
      practiced in the care of sickle cell disease patients yet it has been associated with&#xD;
      improved bone health and bone mineral density, reduced chronic pain and improved quality of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS: Vitamin D supplementation will lead to a lower incidence of hospitalisation than&#xD;
      placebo in Ugandan children with SCA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: The study will be a randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind clinical trial in&#xD;
      which 331 Ugandan children with SCA aged 6 months to 12 years inclusive will receive vitamin&#xD;
      D (60,000IU granules monthly) and another 331 a placebo (identical to vitaminD in appearance)&#xD;
      for 3 months. The primary study outcome will be incidence of hospitalisation. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes will include incidence of vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC), acute severe respiratory&#xD;
      illness, Vitamin D related Severe adverse events and requirements for blood transfusion&#xD;
      IMPACT: If this trial shows a reduction in hospitalisation, it will be the basis for a&#xD;
      multi-site pre-post intervention clinical trial to assess real-world safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      Vitamin D in African children with SCA. The monthly administration is easy, and since vitamin&#xD;
      D is inexpensive, this trial has the potential to improve the health of hundreds/ thousands&#xD;
      of African children with SCA through reduction of infection-related morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
