  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastric aspiration represents the third cause of perioperative death in France. In scheduled&#xD;
      surgery, it can be prevented by preoperative fasting. The French and American guidelines&#xD;
      recommend a fasting of 2 hours for clear liquids and 6 hours for solid food. However, these&#xD;
      durations could be too short in case of delayed gastric emptying due to medications of&#xD;
      diabetes for example. This latter condition has an increasing incidence. Numerous&#xD;
      complications are related to chronic hyperglycemia including delayed gastric emptying also&#xD;
      known as gastroparesis. Around one third of diabetic patients presents this complication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gastric ultrasound represents a non-invasive method to explore the stomach. It allows the&#xD;
      qualitative and quantitative evaluations of gastric content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As diabetic patients present a risk of non-empty stomach despite fasting,investigators&#xD;
      decided to conduct a prospective observational study compare the appearance of the stomach&#xD;
      assessed by ultrasonography between diabetic and non-diabetic patients before scheduled&#xD;
      surgery&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Gastric aspiration represents the third cause of perioperative death in France. The&#xD;
      physiopathology of this complication is multifactorial, implying among other things the lack&#xD;
      of respect for the rules of preoperative fasting, especially during emergency operations.&#xD;
      Indeed, the presence of food content in the stomach, combined with the decrease in the&#xD;
      pressure of the lower sphincter of the esophagus and the protection of the upper airways&#xD;
      during the induction of general anesthesia, is accompanied by a significant increase in the&#xD;
      risk of regurgitation and inhalation of gastric contents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are more than 3 million diabetic patients in France, with an increase in prevalence of&#xD;
      more than 5% per year. The main digestive disorder linked to autonomic neuropathy in the&#xD;
      diabetic subject is represented by gastroparesis, characterized by a delay in gastric&#xD;
      emptying without mechanical impediment, associated with signs of abnormal gastric motility.&#xD;
      Gastroparesis results from an impairment of the neurovegetative regulation of the stomach&#xD;
      related to exposure to prolonged hyperglycemia. It is estimated that approximately 1/3 of&#xD;
      diabetics are affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound measurement of the antral section area was originally described for the evaluation&#xD;
      and study of gastric emptying in obstetrics and medicine. Several studies have shown the&#xD;
      interest of this measurement for the evaluation of gastric content and volume in the&#xD;
      preoperative period. The antral ultrasound makes it possible to discriminate a &quot;full&quot; stomach&#xD;
      from an &quot;empty&quot; stomach with excellent performance. Thus, investigators have at our disposal&#xD;
      a simple and non-invasive tool to evaluate in real time the state of gastric vacuity in&#xD;
      patients in the operating room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In practice, ultrasound measurement of the antral section area is performed using an&#xD;
      ultrasound scanner equipped with a 2-5 MHz frequency probe. The diameters (longitudinal D1&#xD;
      and anteroposterior D2) of the antrum are measured in the sagittal plane passing through the&#xD;
      abdominal aorta and the left lobe of the liver. The value of the antral cross-sectional area&#xD;
      is given by the formula: antral area = π x D1 x D2 / 4. This ultrasound measurement of the&#xD;
      antral cross-sectional area is commonly performed in the operating room and is recommended in&#xD;
      some anesthesia reference books. Several mathematical models have been constructed, in adults&#xD;
      and children, to calculate the volume of gastric contents based on this measurement of anal&#xD;
      area, with satisfactory accuracy (R² = 0.72 to 0.86). Gastric ultrasound is easily performed&#xD;
      at the patient's bedside, before general or local anesthesia, and its use has recently been&#xD;
      described to study gastric emptying.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators would like to evaluate the gastric content in diabetics in the perioperative&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
