  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to explore between 6-7 patient participants' (18-50 years old inclusive) own&#xD;
      expectations and hopes leading up to a THA, then to examine their own views on their recovery&#xD;
      and rehabilitation post-operatively. A qualitative, longitudinal approach will be utilised&#xD;
      for this research with a generic qualitative method analysing the verbal data taken during&#xD;
      interviews with participants. A combination of semi-structured and narrative interview&#xD;
      techniques will investigate the patients' individual expected outcomes and priorities for&#xD;
      their recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study approach seeks to explore the patients' own views of a successful outcome of THA,&#xD;
      it hopes to discover any potential themes of needs and priorities in the younger patient, and&#xD;
      compare these to the standard way of measuring these outcomes by using PROMS. The outcome&#xD;
      will contribute to determining what more can be done to improve the care currently in place&#xD;
      for this increasing group of patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To be confident that healthcare providers are providing the very best patient care in the&#xD;
      instance of the younger patient it is essential to ask them their own interpretation of needs&#xD;
      and priorities, and how they feel they can be met. There currently is an urgent need for&#xD;
      further studies into the area of total hip arthroplasty in young patients, especially&#xD;
      qualitative research defining the outcomes important to them after surgery. The considerably&#xD;
      larger, older patient population undergoing this surgery often influence the way&#xD;
      post-operative outcomes are measured (Larsson et al 2019, Mannion et al 2009, Wright and&#xD;
      Young 1997, Wright et al 2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to discover and explore the following questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Are the priorities of the younger patient (&lt; 50) being addressed and fulfilled when&#xD;
      undergoing a THR? Are the current Outcome Measures identifying the priorities and required&#xD;
      outcomes of the younger patient (&lt; 50) undergoing a THR? The study will use a qualitative&#xD;
      approach and method. Interviews will be conducted either face to face, via telephone or video&#xD;
      calls dependent on participant preference. Semi-structured and narrative methods will be&#xD;
      combined to encourage the participant to talk freely in regard to their own views and&#xD;
      opinions on their surgery. Participants will also be asked to complete the Hip Disability and&#xD;
      Osteoarthritis Hip Score (HOOS) at baseline (pre surgery), 6 weeks post-surgery and 6 months&#xD;
      post-surgery time points to examine if this outcome measure illustrates a similar state to&#xD;
      that which they described during their interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the participants' consent, these interviews will be recorded and transcribed by the&#xD;
      Chief Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be assigned a study number on recruitment. All data will be anonymised and&#xD;
      labelled with the appropriate participant's study number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Audio recordings of qualitative interviews will be transcribed by the Chief Investigator and&#xD;
      anonymised transcriptions will be stored on secure servers at Milton Keynes University&#xD;
      Hospital (MKUH). The audio recordings will be deleted at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent forms, any paper case report forms (CRF) and completed HOOS will be filed in the site&#xD;
      file which will be held in a secure, locked filing cabinet within the Research and&#xD;
      Development Department at Milton Keynes University Hospital. Identifiable data will be kept&#xD;
      separately from the outcome data (both paper and electronic).&#xD;
&#xD;
      No identifiable information will be shared with other persons at any point. The study plans&#xD;
      to interview the participants at three different time points in their surgical journey. The&#xD;
      first will be pre surgery (baseline) at around the time that the operative treatment is&#xD;
      decided upon and the Surgeon has listed them for surgery. The second interview will be&#xD;
      conducted around six weeks post operatively (+ 14 days), this will explore the patients'&#xD;
      thoughts on their immediate post-operative recovery and how they feel they are progressing.&#xD;
      The final time will be six months post-surgery (+ 30 days); this interview will examine the&#xD;
      patients' own opinions on their surgical outcomes and their own interpretation of the success&#xD;
      of the procedure. The HOOS will also be completed at each time point.&#xD;
