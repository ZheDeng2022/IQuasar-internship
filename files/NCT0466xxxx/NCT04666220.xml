    <textblock>
      Metastasis is the main cause of death in cancer patients and often epithelial-to-mesenchymal&#xD;
      transition (EMT) is advocated as the basic mechanism. Recently Fang and colleagues described&#xD;
      an EMT-independent process of metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC): endothelium&#xD;
      covers small cluster of tumor cells allowing tumor dissemination. This process of&#xD;
      angiogenesis, named VETC (vessels that encapsulate tumor clusters) in HCC literature, has&#xD;
      been described under different names in other cancer types. Furthermore, the investigators&#xD;
      confirmed the negative impact of VETC on patients' prognosis on a large multicenter cohort of&#xD;
      HCCs. Moreover, Fang et al demonstrated that patients affected by VETC-positive HCC benefit&#xD;
      more from sorafenib therapy. Interestingly, this type of angiogenesis was also found in renal&#xD;
      cell carcinoma, adrenal gland pheochromocytoma, thyroid follicular carcinoma and alveolar&#xD;
      soft part sarcoma (ASPS) and associated to prognosis. Moreover, the distinction between&#xD;
      benign and malignant neoplasms of the adrenal gland is a complex matter, being the&#xD;
      established criteria still lacking a strong reproducibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several tyrosine kinase inhibitors are available for different cancer types; among them, HCC,&#xD;
      RCC, ASPS, and TC may benefit from the so-called antiangiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitors&#xD;
      (aTKI) (such as sunitinib, sorafenib, pazopanib). A general (histotype-independent)&#xD;
      validation of the prognostic role of VETC is missing. Moreover, inhibitors of tyrosine-kinase&#xD;
      vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR-TKI), represent an effective treatment&#xD;
      for different cancer types, but predictive markers are still needed. In addition, novel&#xD;
      systemic immunotherapy agents are being approved in many cancer types, as alternative to&#xD;
      angiogenesis inhibitors. A broader frame including metastatic mechanisms, tumor&#xD;
      microenvironment (TME, i.e. angiogenesis and immune infiltrate) and treatment response could&#xD;
      answer to several needs currently unmet. Bayesian networks and causal models can be employed&#xD;
      to effectively draw conclusions from retrospective data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to investigate in patients with RCC and adrenal carcinoma&#xD;
      (AC) the VETC-expression on tumor tissue, correlating the results with clinical data,&#xD;
      patients characteristics, and outcome.&#xD;

      Background and introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metastasis is the main cause of death in cancer patients and often epithelial-to-mesenchymal&#xD;
      transition (EMT) is advocated as the basic mechanism, although some limitations have been&#xD;
      identified [1,2] Recently Fang and colleagues described an EMT-independent process of&#xD;
      metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC): endothelium (highlighted by CD34&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry) covers small cluster of tumor cells allowing tumor dissemination [3].&#xD;
      This process of angiogenesis, named VETC (vessels that encapsulate tumor clusters) in HCC&#xD;
      literature, has been described under different names in other cancer types [4]. Furthermore,&#xD;
      the investigators confirmed the negative impact of VETC on patients' prognosis on a large&#xD;
      multicenter cohort of HCCs [5]. Moreover, Fang et al demonstrated that patients affected by&#xD;
      VETC-positive HCC benefit more from sorafenib therapy [6]. Interestingly, this type of&#xD;
      angiogenesis was also found in renal cell carcinoma, adrenal gland pheochromocytoma, thyroid&#xD;
      follicular carcinoma and alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) and associated to prognosis [7-10,&#xD;
      34,35]. Moreover, the distinction between benign and malignant neoplasms of the adrenal gland&#xD;
      is a complex matter, being the established criteria still lacking a strong reproducibility&#xD;
      [36].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several tyrosine kinase inhibitors are available for different cancer types; among them, HCC,&#xD;
      RCC, ASPS, and TC may benefit from the so-called antiangiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitors&#xD;
      (aTKI) (such as sunitinib, sorafenib, pazopanib) [11-14].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale of the study A general (histotype-independent) validation of the prognostic role of&#xD;
      VETC is missing. Moreover, inhibitors of tyrosine-kinase vascular endothelial growth factor&#xD;
      receptors (VEGFR-TKI), represent an effective treatment for different cancer types, but&#xD;
      predictive markers are still needed. Moreover, novel systemic immunotherapy agents are being&#xD;
      approved in many cancer types, as alternative to angiogenesis inhibitors. A broader frame&#xD;
      including metastatic mechanisms, tumor microenvironment (TME, i.e. angiogenesis and immune&#xD;
      infiltrate) and treatment response could answer to several needs currently unmet. Bayesian&#xD;
      networks and causal models can be employed to effectively draw conclusions from retrospective&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives of the study General objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The systematic investigation of VETC in RCC and AC in order to depict the impact of this&#xD;
           phenomenon.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To explore the possible role of TME and in particular of VETC in predicting a more&#xD;
           beneficial response to VEGFR-TKIs, providing a new tool in guiding the therapeutic&#xD;
           choice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design The study is monocentric, observational, and it will be performed on clinical&#xD;
      and histological data collected in the course of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all series, clinical and epidemiological features will be recorded, all available&#xD;
      histological slides will be reviewed and, on the primary tumor slides, histological&#xD;
      characteristics will be re-assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whenever multiple samples of tumors would be present, those having the tumor-surrounding&#xD;
      tissue interface will be selected and stained with CD34 antibody.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VETC will be evaluated independently by, at least, two pathologists, blinded to clinical&#xD;
      data. VETC will be recorded as positive or negative, being VETC defined as CD34 unequivocal&#xD;
      immunoreactivity of a continuous lining of endothelial cells around tumor clusters. VETC will&#xD;
      be considered alternative to the common capillary pattern, consisting in small circular or&#xD;
      linear blood vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical considerations The project plans to collect data of 100 of patients who underwent&#xD;
      surgery for RCC at our institution between 2005 and 2007 for the evaluation of VETC impact on&#xD;
      prognosis, and data of 60 patients who received sunitinib or pazopanib as first-line&#xD;
      treatment for RCC at our center to explore if patients with VETC vascular phenotype would&#xD;
      benefit more from the treatment with TKIs. Furthermore, the investigators will collect data&#xD;
      of 20 patients who underwent surgery for AC at our Institution between 2000 and 2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bayesian Analysis Directed acyclic graphs will be constructed with available scientific&#xD;
      information; adjustment sets and conditional independencies will be calculated [15-17]. Prior&#xD;
      predictive simulations, when relevant, will be deployed to regularize the prior and reduce&#xD;
      overfitting. Continuous variables will be standardized to facilitate sampling. Models will be&#xD;
      fit using Stan (a probabilistic programming language) and R [18,19]. Stan runs a No U-Turn&#xD;
      sampler, an extension to Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling, which is itself a form of&#xD;
      Markov Chain Monte Carlo [20-22]. Four chains for 4000 iterations, or 8000 whenever the bulk&#xD;
      effective sample size will be low, will be generated. The final 2000 (or 4000) iterations of&#xD;
      each chain converge as indicated by post-modeling diagnostics such as the number of effective&#xD;
      Gelman-Rubin R ̂.[23] A satisfactory posterior predictive model performance will be ensured&#xD;
      before using sample means (for estimates) and sample quantiles (for compatibility intervals&#xD;
      (CI)) [23,24]. CI will be calculated as 89% of the highest posterior density interval (HDPI)&#xD;
      [23]. Whenever more clusters of data would be present, the investigators will use varying&#xD;
      effects multilevel (hierarchical) models [25]. To limit divergent transitions, the&#xD;
      investigators will reparameterize the models with a non-centered equivalent form [26]&#xD;
      Predictive accuracy will be measured trough widely applicable information criteria (WAIC)&#xD;
      [27].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal of subjects Missing data will be treated modeling the missingness process. [28-29]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forms and procedures for collecting data and data managing To each subject will be assigned a&#xD;
      sequential identification number. For each subject data will be collected in a case report&#xD;
      form (CRF). CRF will include SIN, name, sex, date of birth, date of primary surgery, side ,&#xD;
      size, histotype, relevant grading, necrosis, lymphovascular invasion , R , stage, date of TKI&#xD;
      therapy, date of disease progression, prognostic scores (IMDC score [30], MSKCC score [31]),&#xD;
      Karnofsky score [32], first-last line data (type, dates of beginning and end, best response,&#xD;
      progression date), last follow-up status, last contact, death, VETC. All data will be&#xD;
      registered in Microsoft Excel spreadsheet format. Data are collected by the data manager and&#xD;
      database base will be locked with a password. Spaces will be filled with &quot;NA&quot; whenever a&#xD;
      characteristic was not explored or an item is not applicable to the individual case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For AC, CRF will include SIN, name, sex, date of birth, date of primary surgery, side, size,&#xD;
      and prognostic criteria for malignancy based on Weiss Classification mod [33].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations Patient protection The responsible investigator will ensure that this&#xD;
      study will be conducted in agreement with either the Declaration of Helsinki (Tokyo, Venice,&#xD;
      Hong Kong and Somerset West amendments) or the laws and regulations of the country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol has been written, and the study will be conducted according to the institutional&#xD;
      (ICH) Guideline for Good Clinical Practice The protocol and its annexes were subject to&#xD;
      review and approval by the competent Independent Ethics Committee(s) (&quot;IEC&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject identification - Personal Data protection All records identifying the subject must be&#xD;
      kept confidential and, to the extent permitted by the applicable laws and/or regulations, not&#xD;
      be made publicly available. The name of the patient will not be asked for nor recorded at the&#xD;
      Data Center. A sequential identification number will be automatically attributed to each&#xD;
      patient registered in the study. This number will identify the patient and must be included&#xD;
      on all case report forms. In order to avoid identification errors, patient initials and date&#xD;
      of birth will also be reported on the case report forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any and all patient information or documentation pertaining to a clinical trial, to the&#xD;
      extent permitting, through a &quot;key&quot; kept anywhere, regardless of whether such key is supplied&#xD;
      along with the information or documentation or not, must be considered as containing&#xD;
      sensitive personal data of the patient, and is therefore subjected to the provisions of&#xD;
      applicable data protection (&quot;privacy&quot;) regulations. Breach of such regulations may result in&#xD;
      administrative or even criminal sanctions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient information or documentation may be considered &quot;anonymous&quot;, and as such not subject&#xD;
      to privacy regulations, only when no key whatsoever, permitting the identification of the&#xD;
      patient, is any longer available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent All patients will be informed of the aims of the study. They will be&#xD;
      informed as to the strict confidentiality of their patient data, but that their medical&#xD;
      records may be reviewed for study purposes by authorized individuals other than their&#xD;
      treating physician.It will be emphasized that the participation is voluntary and that the&#xD;
      patient is allowed to refuse further participation in the protocol whenever he/she wants.&#xD;
      This will not prejudice the patient's subsequent care. Documented informed consent must be&#xD;
      obtained for all patients included in the study before they are registered at the Data&#xD;
      Center. This must be done in accordance with the national and local regulatory requirements.&#xD;
      For European Union member states, the informed consent procedure must conform to the ICH&#xD;
      guidelines on Good Clinical Practice. This implies that &quot;the written informed consent form&#xD;
      should be signed and personally dated by the patient or by the patient's legally acceptable&#xD;
      representative&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conflict of Interest Any investigator and/or research staff member who has a conflict of&#xD;
      interest with this study (such as patent ownership, royalties, or financial gain greater than&#xD;
      the minimum allowable by their institution) must fully disclose the nature of the conflict of&#xD;
      interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data ownership According to the ICH Guidelines on Good Clinical Practice the sponsor of a&#xD;
      study (the Institution, should the investigator or study coordinators act as sponsor in the&#xD;
      performance of her/his institutional duties under the employment or collaboration agreement&#xD;
      with Humanitas) is the owner of the data resulting therefrom. All centers and investigators&#xD;
      participating in the study should be made aware of such circumstance and invited not to&#xD;
      disseminate information or data without the Institution's prior express consent.&#xD;
