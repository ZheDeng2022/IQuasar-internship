  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the impact of pelvic floor physical therapy during&#xD;
      pregnancy on delivery and the impact on the woman's body and function. Currently there have&#xD;
      not been any studies to our knowledge that have examined this relationship and the outcomes&#xD;
      for the pregnant patient. The current research that is available is on pelvic floor training&#xD;
      and perineal massage during pregnancy with positive outcomes. The questions we are looking to&#xD;
      answer include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Does pelvic floor physical therapy during pregnancy decrease the severity of perineal&#xD;
           trauma during delivery?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Does pelvic floor physical therapy during pregnancy decrease the length of the second&#xD;
           stage of labor (pushing)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Does pelvic floor physical therapy during pregnancy decrease the occurrence of emergency&#xD;
           C-section?&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to explore the impact of pelvic floor manual physical therapy&#xD;
      techniques during pregnancy on delivery and the impact on the woman's body and function.&#xD;
      Currently there have not been any studies to our knowledge that have examined this&#xD;
      relationship and the outcomes for the pregnant patient. The current research that is&#xD;
      available is on pelvic floor training and perineal massage during pregnancy with positive&#xD;
      outcomes. Perineal massage is a stretching technique utilized to relax the tissue of the&#xD;
      perineum (the area between the vaginal opening and anus), and is considered routine physical&#xD;
      therapy standard of care for pregnant women. Myofascial release of the pelvic floor is a&#xD;
      specific manual therapy technique to relax the muscles of the pelvic floor which can include&#xD;
      the superficial perineal area. Pelvic myofascial release is a technique used for both&#xD;
      pregnant women, and women with chronic pelvic pain. In fact, each component of assessment and&#xD;
      treatment are routine and standard PT practices (evaluation, manual therapy, exercise,&#xD;
      education), however this specific manual therapy treatment protocol has not been studied&#xD;
      during pregnancy to assess the benefits on delivery/recovery. The questions we are looking to&#xD;
      answer include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Does pelvic floor PT (physical therapy) during pregnancy decrease the severity of&#xD;
           perineal trauma during delivery?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Does pelvic floor PT during pregnancy decrease the length of the second stage of labor&#xD;
           (pushing)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Does pelvic floor PT during pregnancy decrease the occurrence of emergency C-section?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Does pelvic floor PT during pregnancy decrease the likelihood and/or severity of&#xD;
           postpartum pelvic pain and pelvic dysfunction? By obtaining these findings, it will&#xD;
           allow for program design and treatment recommendations within the pregnancy period to&#xD;
           minimize delivery trauma and risk for the mother.&#xD;
