      Mirabegron (Myrbetriq®, Astellas) is a highly specific and well-tolerated ß3 agonist marketed&#xD;
      for overactive bladder. This trial will assess the effects of mirabegron on glucose tolerance&#xD;
      and adipose tissue in prediabetic patients&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Among the many survival adaptations developed by mammals is a defense against the cold and&#xD;
      hypothermia; one of these adaptations is the ability to uncouple oxidative phosphorylation&#xD;
      and generate heat, rather than adenosine triphosphate (ATP), from lipid substrate in&#xD;
      specialized tissues, and there has been much interest in exploiting this inefficient&#xD;
      metabolism for the treatment of obesity and insulin resistance. Brown adipose tissue (BAT)&#xD;
      protects against obesity in mice, and studies have documented cold-induced BAT in humans&#xD;
      using positron emission tomography (PET-CT) scanning. Additional studies have demonstrated&#xD;
      that white adipose tissue (WAT) can upregulate its thermogenic capacity and become &quot;beige&quot;,&#xD;
      and this beiging of SC WAT likely provides an additional defense against the cold.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brown and beige fat can be activated by cold temperatures, or through catecholamines. The&#xD;
      catecholamines epinephrine and norepinephrine have undesirable side effects. However,&#xD;
      adipocytes are among the few cells that contain ß3 adrenergic receptors (ß3AR), whereas the&#xD;
      heart is dominated by ß1 and ß2 receptors. Therefore, a drug that could target the ß3AR could&#xD;
      activate brown/beige fat without cardiovascular side effects. We have recently performed&#xD;
      human studies and treated obese human subjects with the ß3AR agonist mirabegron. This&#xD;
      resulted in improved glucose homeostasis by increasing insulin sensitivity and insulin&#xD;
      secretion. We found that mirabegron treatment of obese adults did not increase BAT or induce&#xD;
      weight loss, but instead induced beige fat, along with increased insulin sensitivity, which&#xD;
      was accompanied by an increase in type I fibers in skeletal muscle. Mirabegron treatment&#xD;
      stimulated subcutaneous (SC) WAT beiging, lipolysis, and remodeling. However, unlike WAT,&#xD;
      insulin-producing ß-cells and muscle do not express the ß3AR; therefore, it is thought that&#xD;
      the beneficial effects of mirabegron treatment occurred by an indirect mechanism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, mirabegron (Myrbetriq®, Astellas) is a highly specific and well-tolerated ß3&#xD;
      agonist marketed for overactive bladder. It is hypothesized that mirabegron treatment of&#xD;
      prediabetic subjects will improve glucose homeostasis through improved insulin sensitivity&#xD;
      and ß-cell function, in addition to other changes in adipose tissue. Additionally, mirabegron&#xD;
      treatment may change the plasma composition of proteins, lipids, metabolites, short-chain&#xD;
      fatty acids, or exosomal miRNAs that are known to affect peripheral tissue function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will quantify the effects of the ß3 agonist mirabegron on glucose metabolism and&#xD;
      adipose tissue in a placebo-controlled trial and determine some of the mechanistic&#xD;
      underpinnings of these effects.&#xD;
