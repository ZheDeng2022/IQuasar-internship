    <textblock>
      This study will identify whether - and if so, how - tailoring would increase adoption of and&#xD;
      benefit from an interactive internet intervention for insomnia called SHUTi (Sleep Healthy&#xD;
      Using the Internet) for cancer caregivers. Participating caregivers' sleep and sleep-related&#xD;
      characteristics will be characterized from a baseline assessment; then, caregivers will&#xD;
      receive complementary and voluntary access to SHUTi. Among caregivers who choose to use&#xD;
      SHUTi, intervention use, perceived appropriateness, and effects on sleep and quality of life&#xD;
      will be assessed. Among caregivers who choose not to use SHUTi, reasons and barriers to using&#xD;
      the intervention will be assessed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia is a significant public health problem with substantial medical, psychological and&#xD;
      financial ramifications. About 50-75% of the 3.5 million Americans who provide unpaid&#xD;
      medical, practical, and/or emotional support for a loved one with cancer endorse clinically&#xD;
      significant sleep disturbance. Understanding caregivers' psychosocial risk factors and needs,&#xD;
      and the extent to which these are unique to the cancer caregiving context, will ensure&#xD;
      appropriate and effective interventions for cancer caregivers with insomnia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Existing psychosocial services for caregivers are primarily delivered in-person. Although&#xD;
      such interventions are effective, they suffer from low enrollment, high dropout, and limited&#xD;
      reach to caregivers who already have inadequate healthcare access, like caregivers from lower&#xD;
      SES or those in rural areas. Digital health interventions can lower barriers to entry to&#xD;
      supportive care for caregivers as they are conveniently accessible anywhere and anytime from&#xD;
      an Internet-enabled device. Sleep Healthy Using the Internet (SHUTi) is a NCI-designated&#xD;
      research-tested intervention that delivers cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I)&#xD;
      and holds significant potential to accessibly treat insomnia for cancer caregivers. Most&#xD;
      digital health interventions tested among caregivers, however, have been developed de novo&#xD;
      for specific caregiving contexts. The implicit assumption underlying highly tailored&#xD;
      interventions for caregivers is that caregivers have different deficits, risk factors, and&#xD;
      needs from non-caregivers. This assumption has not often been tested, and therefore the&#xD;
      extent to which caregivers want and need tailoring for digital health interventions is not&#xD;
      known. This study is therefore designed to provide the data necessary to ensure the highest&#xD;
      quality, impact, and efficiency from existing evidence-based digital health interventions to&#xD;
      meet pressing psychosocial needs among cancer caregivers. Specifically, this study will&#xD;
      directly inform next research steps for tailoring and testing SHUTi for optimal impact and&#xD;
      reach among caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SHUTi Program: SHUTi is a self-guided (i.e., automated), interactive, and tailored&#xD;
      web-based program modeled on the primary tenants of face-to-face CBT-I (sleep restriction,&#xD;
      stimulus control, cognitive restructuring, sleep hygiene, relapse prevention). Intervention&#xD;
      content is metered out over time through 6 &quot;Cores.&quot; Users obtain access to a new Core based&#xD;
      on a time and event-based schedule (e.g., 7 days after completion of previous Core). This&#xD;
      schedule is consistent with the recommendation from a task force commissioned by the Academy&#xD;
      of Sleep Medicine, which deemed that an average of 6 - 8 sessions constitutes &quot;adequate&#xD;
      treatment exposure&quot;. The SHUTi program relies on user-entered online Sleep Diaries to track&#xD;
      progress and to tailor treatment recommendations (i.e., assign a &quot;sleep restriction&quot; window).&#xD;
      Each Core acts as an online analog for the weekly sessions typically used when delivering&#xD;
      CBT-I in a face-to-face format, following the same general structure: 1) Core objectives&#xD;
      (what will be learned and why this information is important), 2) review of previous week's&#xD;
      homework and sleep diary data, 3) new intervention material, 4) assignment of homework&#xD;
      (treatment strategies for the coming week), and 5) a summary of the Core's main points.&#xD;
      Intervention content is enhanced through a variety of interactive features, including&#xD;
      personalized goal-setting, graphical feedback based on inputted symptoms, animations /&#xD;
      illustrations to enhance comprehension, quizzes to test user knowledge, patient vignettes,&#xD;
      and video-based expert explanation. Automated emails are also sent to encourage program&#xD;
      adherence. There is no content that is specifically about cancer or caregiving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caregivers participating in this study will complete a baseline assessment (questionnaires&#xD;
      and 2 weeks of daily sleep diaries), and then will receive complementary and voluntary access&#xD;
      to SHUTi. Participants who choose to complete 1 or more SHUTi Cores will complete a follow-up&#xD;
      assessment of questionnaires and 2 weeks of sleep diaries; participants who choose not to&#xD;
      complete any SHUTi cores will be asked to provide brief feedback regarding their&#xD;
      reasons/barriers.&#xD;
