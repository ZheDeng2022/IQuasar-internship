  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mild cognitive impairment is becoming one of the most common cynical manifestations that&#xD;
      affect older people. That is why there is a need to investigate non-pharmacological&#xD;
      interventions that help to improve or maintain this problem.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Each week for 8 weeks, GE participants will attend three 60-minute sessions of cognitive&#xD;
      exercises. Each session is divided into 10 minutes of memory practice, which includes&#xD;
      short-term and long-term memory; 10 minutes of language skills, including vocabulary,&#xD;
      comprehension, reading and writing exercises; 10 minutes of calculation, in which arithmetic,&#xD;
      similar and different operations are carried out; 10 minutes of praxis and gnosis where&#xD;
      drawing and recognition and auditory, tactile, spatial, visual attention were promoted; 10&#xD;
      minutes of orientation where knowledge of space, person and place is developed; and 10&#xD;
      minutes of executive functions in which exercises of organization, planning and problem&#xD;
      solving are worked.&#xD;
