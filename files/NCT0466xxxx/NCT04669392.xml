      The aim of the study is to perform a clinical and radiographic evaluation of 70% Ethanol&#xD;
      Alcohol versus Normal Saline as root canal irrigating solutions in partial pulpectomy of&#xD;
      primary molars with Metapex.&#xD;

      In permanent dentition, Calcium Hydroxide-Iodoform paste (Metapex) has a high potential in&#xD;
      forming a calcific barrier in the pulpal tissue. Yet, in primary dentition Metapex forms a&#xD;
      chronic inflammatory reaction to the pulpal tissue leading to its internal and root&#xD;
      resorption. Although the high success rate of Metapex in partial pulpectomy, the rapid&#xD;
      resorption of Metapex has led to the presence of the hollow tube effect due to voids&#xD;
      formation in the canals. However, this will cause early root resorption before the time of&#xD;
      exfoliation. Due to its rapid resorption, Metapex is usually recommended to be used in the&#xD;
      pulpectomy of teeth near exfoliation in order to avoid the early root resorption of primary&#xD;
      dentition in order to avoid the premature loss of the endodontically treated vital primary&#xD;
      teeth with Metapex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saline solution is the basic irrigating solution in root canal treatments, yet it has no&#xD;
      antimicrobial activities and only results in cleaning the root canals. Ethanol irrigation is&#xD;
      believed to be an alternative promising replacement in tissue fixation from Formocresol due&#xD;
      to the concerns from its carcinogenicity and toxicity. Also, Ethanol has an excellent&#xD;
      bactericidal, virucidal, and fungicidal, and most importantly it is one of the volatile&#xD;
      liquids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the effect of Ethanol Alcohol on increasing the success rate of Metapex in&#xD;
      vital pulp therapy will be studied.&#xD;

    <description>Ethanol, also called ethyl alcohol, grain alcohol, or alcohol, a member of a class of organic compounds that are given the general name alcohols.&#xD;
Ethanol is a commonly used fixative. Fixation of the inner layers of the tissue depends on the ability of the fixative to diffuse into the tissue. Moreover, Ethanol has antibacterial antifungal, and antiviral properties.&#xD;
70% Ethanol is the safest concentration because the water that has been mixed into the ethanol slows the drying time, creating a longer contact time. Ethanol needs to have a contact time of at least 10 seconds to kill Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. At a 10 second drying time.</description>
