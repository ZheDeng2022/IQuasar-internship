      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is a well-established and modifiable risk factor&#xD;
      for cardiovascular disease. Monoclonal antibodies that inhibit proprotein convertase&#xD;
      subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9) have emerged as a new class of drugs that effectively lower&#xD;
      LDL cholesterol levels.1 Approximately 735,000 Americans have a myocardial infarction each&#xD;
      year (2), and about 800,000 have a stroke. (3) Many patients remain at increased&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk despite maximum tolerated statin therapy and could benefit from further&#xD;
      LDL-C reduction. Most patients are treated with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, commonly known&#xD;
      as statins. Millions of patients are eligible for cholesterol-lowering medication, according&#xD;
      to current guidelines.4 High-intensity statin therapy reduces LDL-C and cardiovascular events&#xD;
      more than moderate intensity statin therapy. 5 However, the response to statins is variable,&#xD;
      and in some patients it is not tolerable (between 7 percent and 29 percent of patients taking&#xD;
      statins report having muscle symptoms) 6, which represent a principal reason for&#xD;
      nonadherence. Moreover, high-intensity statin therapy may have less benefit in low-risk&#xD;
      primary prevention patients with a modest increase in the incidence of diabetes in such cases&#xD;
      5, 7. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors are currently&#xD;
      indicated for some patients at high risk, including those with familial hypercholesterolemia&#xD;
      or pre-existing cardiovascular disease. PCSK9 inhibitors are a new class of medications that&#xD;
      have been found to be very effective in reducing LDL-C, either as monotherapy or when added&#xD;
      to background statin therapy. Normally, PCSK9 binds to low-density lipoprotein cholesterol&#xD;
      (LDL-C) receptors, reducing the activity of the LDL-C receptors. PCSK9 inhibitors prevent&#xD;
      PCSK9 from binding to the LDL receptor, thereby increasing the activity of the receptors and&#xD;
      enhancing removal of LDL-C from circulation. 8 Current guidelines recommend that patients&#xD;
      whose 10-year risk of major cardiovascular events is 10 percent or greater take statins. 9&#xD;
      Two PCSK9 inhibitors are currently available and approved by FDA for use in the United&#xD;
      States: evolocumab and alirocumab. These drugs are monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) administered&#xD;
      by Proposed Clinical Trial Protocol on Use of PCSK9 Inhibitors for Primary Prevention of&#xD;
      Cardiovascular Disease 3 subcutaneous injection bi-weekly or monthly and are currently&#xD;
      approved for patients with familial hypercholesterolemia or clinical atherosclerotic&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease who require additional lowering of LDL-C. Two recent reports on the&#xD;
      effects of evolocumab and alirocumab have raised expectations that these drugs will&#xD;
      dramatically reduce cardiovascular events.10,11 the rate of major cardiovascular events was&#xD;
      lower with alirocumab than with placebo (1.7 percent versus 3.3 percent; hazard ratio 0.52;&#xD;
      95 percent confidence interval 0.31 to 0.90; P=0.02). 11 Notably, the annual cost for a&#xD;
      single patient in the United States for PCSK9 inhibitors is approximately $14,000.9 The&#xD;
      prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) has increased in kidney transplant recipients.&#xD;
      CVD remains a leading cause of mortality among recipients with functioning grafts. The&#xD;
      pathophysiology of CVD recipients is a complex interplay between preexisting risk factors,&#xD;
      metabolic sequelae of immunosuppressive agents, infection, and rejection.17&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Cardiovascular risk stratification of renal transplant recipients who are followed up in&#xD;
      Hamed Al-Essa organ transplant center of Kuwait.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. To compare the effectiveness of a PCSK9 inhibitor plus maximum tolerated statin therapy&#xD;
      vs. maximum tolerated statin therapy alone in the reduction of major cardiovascular events&#xD;
      among renal transplant recipients with cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. To compare the effectiveness of a PCSK9 inhibitor plus maximum tolerated statin therapy&#xD;
      vs. maximum tolerated statin therapy alone in terms of LDL-C-lowering, muscle symptoms, and&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. To compare patient adherence to the different treatments protocols.&#xD;

      active substances or their excipients to be administered during dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The baseline characteristics of the patients in the two groups will be collected with special&#xD;
      stress on demographic data, history of myocardial infarction, history of previous&#xD;
      non-hemorrhagic stroke, and symptomatic peripheral artery disease. At baseline, all patients&#xD;
      will be on statin therapy (defined in accordance with American College of Cardiology and&#xD;
      American Heart Association joint guidelines12) and or ezetimibe. All antihypertensive&#xD;
      medications, antiplatelet and diuretic therapy will be recorded. The duration of follow-up&#xD;
      will be 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive subcutaneous injections&#xD;
      of evolocumab (either 140 mg every 2 weeks) or matching placebo. Randomization will be&#xD;
      performed in a double-blinded manner with the use of a central computerized system, with&#xD;
      stratification according to the final screening LDL cholesterol level (&lt;2.2 or ≥2.2 mmol per&#xD;
      liter) and region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be followed up in Hamed Al-Essa organ transplant center clinics at least&#xD;
      every 2 months or according the local follow up protocol. Patients who have a fasting LDL&#xD;
      cholesterol level of 1.8 mmol per liter or higher or a non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL)&#xD;
      cholesterol level of 2.6 mmol per liter or higher while they were taking an optimized regimen&#xD;
      of lipid-lowering therapy, which was defined as preferably a high intensity statin but must&#xD;
      have been at least atorvastatin at a dose of 20 mg daily with or without ezetimibe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our immunosuppression protocol consists of 5 doses of antithymocyte globulin (Sanofi US,&#xD;
      Bridgewater, NJ, USA) for high risk patients (as re-transplants, prior pregnancy, blood&#xD;
      transfusion, HLA-antibody positive and or more than 4 HLA mismatches)or 2 doses of IL-2&#xD;
      receptor blocker (basiliximab; Novartis, Inc., Switzerland) for low risk patients.&#xD;
      Maintenance therapy consists of prednisolone, MMF and a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI). The dose&#xD;
      of CNI will be gradually decreasing till the lowest dose by the end of the 1st year guided by&#xD;
      12-hour trough level. We keep the cyclosporine A level between 200 to 250 ng/ml during 1st&#xD;
      month then between 150-200 ng/ml for a couple of months then between 125-150 ng/ml for 2&#xD;
      months and from 75-125 ng/ml till the end of the 1st year. Similarly, we keep tacrolimus&#xD;
      trough levels between 8 to 10 ng/ml during 1st 3 months then from 5-8 ng/ml thereafter.&#xD;
      Maintenance immunosuppression with sirolimus based regimen will be used to rejection free&#xD;
      patients with low immunological risk after 3 months of transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute cellular rejection (ACR) will be treated with intravenous methylprednisolone sodium&#xD;
      succinate (solumedrol 1 gram daily for 3 days) and or thymoglobulin (1 mg /kg for 7 -10 days)&#xD;
      for steroid resistant rejection. Antibody mediated rejection (AAMR) will be treated with&#xD;
      plasma exchange, IVIG (2gm/kg) and rituximab. Patients, who will receive thymoglobulin as&#xD;
      antirejection, will be managed by secondary prophylaxis for 1 month. Patients will be&#xD;
      monitored daily during hospital stay then at each outpatient visit with complete blood&#xD;
      picture, serum creatinine, creatinine clearance, liver function tests (bilirubin, liver&#xD;
      enzymes and albumin) and drug levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lipid Data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The LDL cholesterol level will be checked in the central laboratory for all patients in both&#xD;
      groups at baseline (according to routine laboratory analysis) and every third month using&#xD;
      desktop Mission CE0123 cholesterol monitoring machine, till the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End Points:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy end point will be any major cardiovascular events, defined as the&#xD;
      cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina, or&#xD;
      coronary revascularization. The key secondary efficacy end point will be cardiovascular&#xD;
      death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. Safety was assessed through collection of data on&#xD;
      adverse events and central laboratory testing in Ibn Sina laboratory, Sabah area of Kuwait.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics and sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis of data will be evaluated on computer using SPSS (Statistical Package&#xD;
      for Social Science for Windows) 11.0 package software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). In order&#xD;
      to analyze the identifying and disease related characteristics of patients, matched t-test&#xD;
      will be used to compare means and standard deviations of numerical variables of the two&#xD;
      groups and to test whether there will be a difference between pre-education and&#xD;
      post-education score averages. Categorical data will be compared using the chi square test.&#xD;
      Values for P less than .05 were considered significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality and consent :&#xD;
&#xD;
      To maintain confidentiality, all research data, blood and/urine specimens, Consent Forms,&#xD;
      Data Collection Forms, reports, and other records that leave the site will be identified only&#xD;
      by a Code Number-participant identification number (Participant ID). All records will be kept&#xD;
      in a locked file cabinet. All computer entry and networking programs will be done using PIDs&#xD;
      only. Participants' identifiable private information will not be released to a third party&#xD;
      without written permission of the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed information will be delivered to each patient about the study including the aim and&#xD;
      benefits. Before starting the enrolment of each patient, the investigator will get signed&#xD;
      informed consent which will be kept in patient file. Moreover, a copy of this consent will be&#xD;
      given to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We will exclude participants with diminished capacity, such as minors and mentally&#xD;
           retarded, who cannot consent for themselves from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The original copy of the consent will be kept in the investigators' records, a copy will&#xD;
           be given to each participant, and this will be documented in the participant's record.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The primary investigator and co-primary investigators will be responsible for&#xD;
           implementing the consenting process and obtaining the Informed Consent of Participants.&#xD;
