  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Advances in biomechanical modeling of musculoskeletal systems make it possible to consider&#xD;
      the use of a digital clone of a patient to test surgical procedure before carrying it out on&#xD;
      the patient himself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims at evaluating the design and simulation procedure of anatomical and functional&#xD;
      pre and post surgical patient-specific numerical models.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The general research framework is focused on predicting the functional outcome of orthopaedic&#xD;
      surgery for a given patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since surgery is an invasive and irreversible procedure, it may be useful to carry out&#xD;
      surgical simulations on a digital clone before performing them on the real patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This simulation would therefore be a tool for optimized surgical planning, based on a&#xD;
      realistic functional objective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' work in the design and evaluation of biomechanical models is now&#xD;
      applicable to orthopedic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So, it is necessary to verify that the digital procedures allowing the realization of virtual&#xD;
      surgical gestures are comparable to the procedures actually applied to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, a first retrospective study (Imaging for the generation of personalized biomechanical&#xD;
      models of the musculoskeletal system before and after surgery - ORTHOSIM Retrospective)&#xD;
      Clinical Trial NÂ° NCT03835000, is in progress in order to validate the possibility of&#xD;
      creating pre- and post-operative anatomical digital clones. The aim of this prospective study&#xD;
      is to integrate the functional characteristics of the patient before and after surgery with&#xD;
      the objective of dynamic validation of the biomechanical models created.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OrthosimPro is a bi-centric, longitudinal and prospective study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10 patients needing orthopedic surgery will be enrolled after being informed about the study&#xD;
      and potential risks. They will give written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will not modify :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the operative indication&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the surgical procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the management before and after the surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have a pre and post operative assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anatomical by sectional imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Functional by motion analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, it allows creating 3 digital models for the same patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Creation of Model 1: preoperative dynamic model obtained from the anatomical and&#xD;
           functional preoperative assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Creation of Model 2: Model 1 to which the surgery is applied according to the criteria&#xD;
           indicated by the surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Creation of Model 3: a dynamic postoperative model independent of Models 1 and 2&#xD;
           obtained from the anatomical and functional postoperative assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Validation of each model:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each model will be compared with the patient data used to build the model, there is no&#xD;
      comparison of patients regarding each other or models belonging to different patients. This&#xD;
      study therefore aims to validate an individual's model on his or her own data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison of model 1 (angle, forces, geometry) versus morphological and functional&#xD;
           assessment before surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison of model 3 (angle, forces, geometry) versus morphological and functional&#xD;
           assessment after surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation the surgery simulation procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison of model 2 (angle, forces, geometry) versus model 3&#xD;
