      This study aims to test the use of a 10 mm laparoscopy trocar tip for formation of a new&#xD;
      vaginal orifice with preservation of an annular hymen (Darwish hymenotomy technique) in cases&#xD;
      of post pubertal imperforate hymen (IH). A prospective interventional case series done at a&#xD;
      minimally invasive surgery unit of a tertiary university hospital between July 2013 and&#xD;
      October 2019 comprising patients with primary amenorrhea and hematocolpus. Circular&#xD;
      hymenotomy using a 10 mm laparoscopy trocar tip and sleeve done under general anesthesia was&#xD;
      done in 36 cases. Documented vaginal patency with formation of an annular hymen in all cases&#xD;
      was reported on follow-up visits without reported intraoperative complications. Patient and&#xD;
      family satisfaction with excellent sensation of preserved hymen was also documented. Using a&#xD;
      10 mm laparoscopy trocar tip for formation of a new vaginal opening with preservation of&#xD;
      annular hymen (Darwish technique) in cases of postpubertal IH is a simple, effective and safe&#xD;
      procedure suitable for Islamic and conservative societies with excellent impact on the&#xD;
      psychological and emotional status of the patient and her family.&#xD;

      This study is a prospective interventional case series conducted at the Minimally Invasive&#xD;
      Surgery Unit of the Woman's Health University Hospital, Assiut, Egypt, between July 2013 and&#xD;
      October 2019. It was approved in May 2013 by the local ethical committee of the faculty of&#xD;
      Medicine, Assiut University. After detailed explanation of the study, all cases or parents&#xD;
      signed an informed consent to participate in this study. It comprised 43 cases with primary&#xD;
      amenorrhea and hematocolpus. Patients' complaints included a gradually progressive central&#xD;
      abdominal mass, pelvic pain getting worse over time disturbing her studies, urinary&#xD;
      retention, dysuria, constipation and dyschezia separately or collectively depending on the&#xD;
      chronicity of retained menstruation. Clinical examination started by downward labial traction&#xD;
      to separate the labia majora and minora sufficiently to visualize the distal introitus. Girls&#xD;
      with only IH as diagnosed after puberty (postpubertal) without any suspicion of associated&#xD;
      congenital anomaly were included in this study. Low transverse vaginal septum was diagnosed&#xD;
      in 4 cases that were excluded from this study. Differentiation between IH and transverse&#xD;
      vaginal septum relied mainly on clinical examination in the lithotomy position with insertion&#xD;
      of a uterine sound into the dimple. If the sound fails to go up, it is a case of IH. If it&#xD;
      goes up this means a low transverse vaginal septum that requires an advancement operation&#xD;
      with fixation of the edges of the septum to the introitus. In such cases, hymentomy will fail&#xD;
      with reformation of the septum as it is thick in contrast to the thin hymen. During&#xD;
      examination, distal vaginal atresia was excluded by the absence of hymnal distension on&#xD;
      Valsalva and absence of its bluish discoloration in addition to far existence of the&#xD;
      hematocolpos away from the vulva. It was reported in two cases that were also excluded from&#xD;
      the study. If the abdominal mass was noticed to be deviated to one side, a possibility of&#xD;
      type I obstructed hemi-vagina and ipsilateral renal agenesis (OHVIRA) raised and a&#xD;
      confirmatory MRI was requested. Only one case with OHVIRA type I (Blind hemi-vaginal septum&#xD;
      without an opening) was detected and excluded from the study. This case presented with&#xD;
      primary amenorrhea due to a rudimentary contralateral horn. Clinical examination of 36 cases&#xD;
      with IH was relatively easy as the patient presented with a vaginal bulge of thin hymenal&#xD;
      tissue with a dark or bluish hue caused by the hematocolpos behind it. If the physical&#xD;
      examination revealed a bulging hymen and ultrasonography confirmed the diagnosis of&#xD;
      hematocolpos, further imaging was not required. In selected cases with ambiguous diagnosis,&#xD;
      MRI was requested to assess the vaginal and the perineum in a meticulous way. For surgical&#xD;
      safety, prepubertal girls with IH were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure stars by putting the patient in the lithotomy position in the OR. After&#xD;
      induction of general anesthesia, sterilization and toweling of the perineum was done.&#xD;
      Insertion of an indwelling urethral catheter and PR to exclude other anomalies or&#xD;
      abnormalities were done. The tip of a 10 mm laparoscopy trocar with a sharp triangular point&#xD;
      (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany) was inserted in the center of the most bulging point of the&#xD;
      IH. Once the edge of the sleeve followed the tip of the trocar tip into the hymen, no further&#xD;
      advancement of the trocar tip was made to avoid unintentional injuries by the trocar itself.&#xD;
      After its withdrawal, the sleeve was left insitu for drainage of the retained blood.&#xD;
      Suprapubic pressure was not done to avoid ascending infection by the negative pressure. After&#xD;
      complete stoppage of flow of the retained menstruation the sleeve was removed. Usually no&#xD;
      further intervention was needed. If oozing points were seen, a gentle bipolar coagulation was&#xD;
      used. The remaining hymenal ring was evaluated and documented in the patient's file whether&#xD;
      intact circular or not. All technical steps are shown in figure 1. After recovery, the&#xD;
      patient was kept for few hours in the postoperative ward then discharged. She was advised to&#xD;
      come for follow-up after the coming menstruation or after 40 days if no menses occur. She was&#xD;
      examined to ensure patency of the vagina, the integrity of the hymen and sonographically to&#xD;
      ensure absence of retained menstruation and to assess both kidneys. Subsequent follow-up&#xD;
      visits were optional whenever they notice any change in the menstrual flow. Otherwise&#xD;
      telephone calls were kept with them thereafter. Outcomes included hymenal ring integrity on&#xD;
      naked eye examination, patient satisfaction, relief of symptoms, and a feeling of well-being.&#xD;
      Due to rarity of cases, the same patient was used to compare preoperative and postoperative&#xD;
      results.&#xD;
