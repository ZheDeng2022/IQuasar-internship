      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no previous contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) study for pediatric Crohn disease&#xD;
      patients. There are adult studies which included adolescent patients. More pediatric patients&#xD;
      have been diagnosed as Crohn disease due to dietary change in Korea and it would be cost&#xD;
      effective and clinically useful if CEUS was available in Crohn disease patients as a&#xD;
      diagnostic and follow up tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective, hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary Objective To prospectively examine the feasibility of Contrast Enhanced&#xD;
           Ultrasound (CEUS) in the assessment of Crohn's disease (CD) using endoscopy as a&#xD;
           reference standard Feasibility was defined as the successful examination in over 90% of&#xD;
           included patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary Objective To reaffirm the dosing and safety of ultrasound contrast agent and&#xD;
           assess the image quality of the CEUS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single center prospective observational study. Pediatric patients who was first&#xD;
      diagnosed as CD with colonoscopy are enrolled in this study, The disease activity, clinical&#xD;
      symptoms are also investigated. Within a period of maximally two weeks from the reference&#xD;
      ileocolonoscopy and before any therapeutic changes, the patients underwent CEUS. CEUS was&#xD;
      performed by one different pediatric radiologist, masked to all other imaging, endoscopic,&#xD;
      and clinical data, except diagnosis of CD. CEUS was analyzed using quantification soft-ware&#xD;
      (Vuebox), based on ROI at the most enhanced part of the bowel wall, quantitative parameters&#xD;
      were calculated. After the first CEUS, CEUS would be performed after one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pediatric population , 20 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within a period of maximally two weeks from the reference ileocolonoscopy and before any&#xD;
      therapeutic changes, the patients underwent CEUS on the same day. All studies started with a&#xD;
      grey scale US examination to find the terminal ileum and assess wall thickness, induration of&#xD;
      surrounding fatty tissue and enlarged lymphnodes. Stenosis and length of the pathologic bowel&#xD;
      wall was estimated, as well as complications such as abscess formation and fistulae. The&#xD;
      thickest segment of the terminal ileum was identified and used to perform analysis of&#xD;
      contrast enhancement. The investigators injected the second generation, ultrasonic contrast&#xD;
      agent (SonoVue, Bracco, Milan, Italy) as a bolus of 0.03 ml/kg through a three-way 20-gauge&#xD;
      catheter in an antecubital vein, followed by a bolus of 5 ml saline solution (0.9% NaCl).CEUS&#xD;
      was performed with a 7.5MHz linear probe and contrast-tuned technology, based on allow&#xD;
      mechanical index and a real-time scan to ensure the preservation of the contrast agent. A low&#xD;
      acoustic power setting was used, expressing a low mechanical index (MI), 0.09-0.14, of a 7.5&#xD;
      MHz linear probe. To assess the vascularization of the involved bowel loop, the contrast&#xD;
      uptake over quantitative analysis of the brightness intensity was measured over a period of&#xD;
      40 s, in regions of interest (ROI) located manually in the intestinal wall with at least 2&#xD;
      cm2. The investigators used a dedicated software (Vuebox) and a time-intensity curve was&#xD;
      automatically acquired. The quantitative measurement of the contrast uptake was obtained as&#xD;
      the difference between the maximum enhancement value and the baseline value before the&#xD;
      arrival of contrast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis, evaluation, reporting of results:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. data acquisition: age, sex, initial treatment,&#xD;
&#xD;
           - define involved bowel segment (5 segments: the terminal ileum, right colon (cecum and&#xD;
           ascending), transverse colon, left colon (descending and sigmoid) and rectum), Gray&#xD;
           scale US parameters identification of the terminal ileum, wall thickness measurement at&#xD;
           the maximal diameter of the affected terminal ileum (pathological mural thickening&#xD;
           defined as a wall thickness above 3 mm), evaluation of the affected bowel length,&#xD;
           stratified wall appearance, perivisceral findings such as creeping fat and stenosis,&#xD;
           fistula or abscess CEUS quantitative parameters, Numerous CEUS quantitative perfusion&#xD;
           parameters can be derived from this curve. FT indicates fall time; mTTl, mean local&#xD;
           transit time; PE, peak enhancement; RT, rise time; TTP, time to peak; WiAUC, wash-in&#xD;
           area under the curve; WiR, wash-in rate; WiWoAUC, wash-in 1 wash-out area under the&#xD;
           curve; WoAUC, wash-out area under the curve; and WoR, wash-out rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Clinical and laboratory parameters (CDAI,, CRP, ESR and Calprotectin)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. interpretation: independent interpretation of CEUS with colonoscopy as gold standard&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. outcome assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Successfully complete event number without adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Treatment response: assessed by pediatric gastroenterologist by lab results,&#xD;
                colonoscopy results, and patient symptom improvement&#xD;
