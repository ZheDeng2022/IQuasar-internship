  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is interested in the flow of consciousness and its modalizations during&#xD;
      psychological trauma (post-traumatic stress disorder) and its resolution. It is based on the&#xD;
      premise that in PTSD, consciousness becomes more rigid, less fluid, due to the memory always&#xD;
      imposing itself on the consciousness. The resolution of the trauma and the subsequent&#xD;
      reduction of anxiety might improve the fluidity of consciousness and thus lead to an overall&#xD;
      improvement in the psychological state of PTSD patients. In cases of PTSD, music has been&#xD;
      shown to reduce anxiety from the very first session and has a very positive effect on all&#xD;
      PTSD symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project the following elements will be evaluated : on one hand, the changes in&#xD;
      consciousness and its fluidity and, on the other hand, the evolution of anxiety following the&#xD;
      listening of a new kind of work, videomusic (which associates a video scenario with music)&#xD;
      exemplifying (metaphorizing) the trauma and its resolution.&#xD;

    <measure>Consciousness fluidity using a questionnaire dedicated to this measure</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Consciousness fluidity will be assessed before and after videomusic listening from the scores obtained at a questionnaire Evaluating Qualitatively the Fluidity of Consciousness (EQFC). Minimum and maximum values are 1 for &quot;Never&quot; and 6 for &quot;Always&quot;. For some items, 1 indicates a better outcome and for some it is the contrary.</description>

    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patient anxiety level will be analyzed before and after videomusic listening thanks to State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) scale and scores obtained will be correlated with EQFC scores. For each item scores go from 1 to 4. For some of them 1 means &quot;Not at all&quot; and 4 &quot;A lot&quot; and for others it is the contrary. A global score superior to 65 indicates a high level of anxiety and a global score inferior or equal to 35 a very low level of anxiety.</description>
