  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary dysmenorrhea is common and can result in significant disability for many women,&#xD;
      causing a high degree of discomfort and reduced quality of life (QoL). Our preliminary&#xD;
      studies suggested that high-intensity aerobic training (HIAT) for 30 minutes, three times a&#xD;
      week at 70%-85% of maximum heart rate was effective for decreasing pain and improving QoL in&#xD;
      women suffering from primary dysmenorrhea. However, to date, no studies have evaluated the&#xD;
      beneficial effects of HIAT on academic performance and absenteeism or the cost-effectiveness&#xD;
      of HIAT for women with primary dysmenorrhea. Furthermore, the mechanisms underlying aerobic&#xD;
      exercise-induced analgesia in primary dysmenorrhea remain unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here, we propose a study to address this important knowledge gap by investigating the effects&#xD;
      of HIAT on absenteeism and academic performance among university students with primary&#xD;
      dysmenorrhea and examine the physiological mechanisms underlying aerobic exercise-induced&#xD;
      analgesia by conducting a fully powered, randomised, controlled crossover trial. We also&#xD;
      propose to conduct an economic evaluation to determine the cost-effectiveness of HIAT&#xD;
      compared with a wait-listed control group receiving usual care, according to the societal and&#xD;
      healthcare perspectives of Hong Kong. The results of this cutting-edge research will be&#xD;
      important for clinicians, researchers, policymakers, and women with primary dysmenorrhea. The&#xD;
      knowledge gained from the proposed study will be useful for researchers when designing future&#xD;
      studies to identify the mediators of pain interventions for clinical improvements, which&#xD;
      could themselves be the target of future interventions. The findings of the proposed study&#xD;
      will inform decision-makers regarding the extent to which existing or standard and potential&#xD;
      interventions can improve population health (effectiveness) and the resources required to&#xD;
      implement these interventions (costs).&#xD;

      Objectives: (1): To evaluate the effectiveness of high-intensity aerobic training (HIAT) on&#xD;
      pain intensity, absenteeism, and academic performance among university students with primary&#xD;
      dysmenorrhea. (2): To investigate the physiological mechanism(s) underlying aerobic&#xD;
      exercise-induced analgesia in women with primary dysmenorrhea. (3) Compare the&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of HIAT against that for usual care to treat pain associated with primary&#xD;
      dysmenorrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and subjects: A mixed-methods study, including a cross-over RCT, and semi-structured&#xD;
      focus groups, alongside economic evaluation, will be conducted using 130 women with primary&#xD;
      dysmenorrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: Women will randomly allocated into high-intensity aerobic training (HIAT) or&#xD;
      wait-list control (WLC) groups. Participants in the HIAT group will receive supervised&#xD;
      treadmill training for the first 12 weeks of the trial. Following a four-week washout period&#xD;
      the cross-over period will begin during Week 16, and the participants initially randomised to&#xD;
      the WLC group will receive the HIAT regimen from Weeks 14-28. Participants initially&#xD;
      randomized to HIAT group will be instructed not to engage in exercise during the remainder of&#xD;
      the study period (i.e. Weeks 14-28).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: Pain intensity, absenteeism from university, academic performance,&#xD;
      concentration, dysmenorrhea daily diary, and salivary progesterone and prostaglandin F2-alpha&#xD;
      levels in saliva. The EQ-5D-3L will be used to determine the QoL for the HIAT and WLC groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis plan: A preliminary test using the independent samples t-test and a two-sided&#xD;
      Student's unpaired t-test will be performed to rule out carryover effects and identify the&#xD;
      within-participant differences in outcome variables between the study periods, respectively.&#xD;
      Treatment effects will be evaluated using an ANOVA with a mixed-effects model considering the&#xD;
      longitudinal repeated measures, including the effects of time within each study group and the&#xD;
      interaction between time and intervention. The mediation effects will be assessed using the&#xD;
      Sobel test. The EQ-5D responses will be converted into utility scores to estimate the gain or&#xD;
      loss of quality-adjusted life-years (QUALYs). The seemingly unrelated regression (SUR)&#xD;
      analyses will be used to estimate the total cost differences (ΔC) and effect differences&#xD;
      (ΔE). Qualitative data will be analysed using the process of thematic analysis.&#xD;
