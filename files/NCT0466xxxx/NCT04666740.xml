  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study researchers think that combining the drugs pembrolizumab and olaparib (POLAR) may&#xD;
      help people with this disease because pembrolizumab activates the immune system to fight&#xD;
      cancer, and olaparib destroys cancer cells by preventing them from repairing damage to the&#xD;
      genetic information that helps them survive and grow. The study researchers are doing this&#xD;
      study to find out whether combining these drugs may be a more effective treatment for this&#xD;
      cancer than taking olaparib alone.&#xD;
