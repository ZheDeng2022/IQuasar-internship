  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Small Cell Lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly aggressive tumor that accounts for about 15 percent&#xD;
      of all lung cancer cases. SCLC disease progresses rapidly, and about 2/3 of the patients have&#xD;
      extensive stage (ES-SCLC) at the time of diagnosis, with extremely poor prognosis. However,&#xD;
      the overall survival (OS) of ES-SCLC patients was not significantly prolonged, with platinum&#xD;
      combined with etoposide chemotherapy as the standard treatment. In recent years, the&#xD;
      emergence of Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) has made the treatment of ES-SCLC appear at&#xD;
      the dawn. In Impower133 study, Atezolizumab combined with chemotherapy significantly&#xD;
      prolonged OS(median OS 12.3 months vs 10.3 months, HR=0.70, 95%CI 0.54-0.91, P = 0.007).&#xD;
      Durvalumab combined with chemotherapy (CASPIAN study) is the first study in 20 years in which&#xD;
      the total survival time of ES-SCLC treated by first-line therapy is 13 months, and there is&#xD;
      no significant increase in adverse reactions compared with chemotherapy. Therefore, in 2019,&#xD;
      NCCN also recommended Atezolizumab or Durvalumab+ EC regimens as a category 1 preferred&#xD;
      option for first-line treatment of ES-SCLC.&#xD;

      Small Cell Lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly aggressive tumor that accounts for about 15 percent&#xD;

      Durvalumab combined with chemotherapy (CASPIAN study) is the first study in 20 years in which&#xD;
      the total survival time of ES-SCLC treated by first-line therapy is 13 months, and there is&#xD;
      no significant increase in adverse reactions compared with chemotherapy. Therefore, in 2019,&#xD;
      NCCN also recommended Atezolizumab or Durvalumab+ EC regimens as a category 1 preferred&#xD;
      option for first-line treatment of ES-SCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although THE TMB of SCLC is higher in solid tumors, the objective remission rate (ORR) of&#xD;
      SCLC using PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors is slightly lower than that of non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer, and frequent drug resistance becomes the bottleneck of treatment. Some recent studies&#xD;
      have shown that anti-angiogenesis drugs can also reverse the immunosuppressive state of tumor&#xD;
      microenvironment while anti-tumor therapy, and improve the efficacy of ICI, so as to play a&#xD;
      synergistic role. Therefore, anti-angiogenesis therapy combined with immunotherapy is&#xD;
      expected to be a new strategy for the treatment of SCLC. Amlotinib is a multi-target&#xD;
      anti-angiogenic drug, which has been approved for third-line treatment of SCLC with mild&#xD;
      adverse reactions. Anlotinib combined with Durvalumab may have a synergistic antitumor&#xD;
      effect, but no studies have been reported so far. Therefore, on the basis of the CASPIAN&#xD;
      research study, we designed the Durvalumab + chemotherapy + ernesto, first-line treatment for&#xD;
      extensive stage small cell lung cancer with single arm, open, multicenter, phase II clinical&#xD;
      research, expected in domestic five cancer center, into the group of 120 ES - SCLC patients&#xD;
      with untreated, research Durvalumab + chemotherapy + ROM for efficacy and safety of Ann, and&#xD;
      further explore the curative effect of predictive biomarkers.&#xD;
