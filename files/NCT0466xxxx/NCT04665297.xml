  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to conduct a hybrid effectiveness/implementation assessment of the&#xD;
      International Guide for Monitoring Child Development (GMCD) in two LMIC settings, India and&#xD;
      Guatemala, within established rural CHW programs. The primary objectives are (a) to evaluate&#xD;
      the real-world effectiveness of the GMCD; (b) to use an implementation science framework to&#xD;
      understand barriers and facilitators to effective population coverage, provider&#xD;
      implementation, and maintenance; (c) to conduct an economic evaluation of the GMCD.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Specific Aim 1: Assess the effectiveness of the GMCD intervention to improve developmental&#xD;
      outcomes and nurturing care in India and Guatemala. The investigators will conduct a&#xD;
      parallel-arm cluster randomized trial within rural CHW programs. In the primary effectiveness&#xD;
      phase, children under 2 years old will receive the GMCD intervention or control for 12&#xD;
      months. Subsequently, control clusters will cross into the intervention, and continue an&#xD;
      additional 12 months (total 24 study months). The primary developmental effectiveness outcome&#xD;
      will be change in age-adjusted scores at 12 months on the Bayley Scales of Infant&#xD;
      Development, 3rd Edition BSID3) (3). The secondary nurturing care effectiveness outcome will&#xD;
      be change in mean Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment (HOME) score at 12&#xD;
      months (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Assess barriers and facilitators to GMCD implementation using the RE-AIM&#xD;
      evaluation framework (5). RE-AIM domains will be assessed as: (a) Reach: participation rates,&#xD;
      comparison of participant/non-participant characteristics, attendance/drop-out; (b)&#xD;
      Effectiveness: impact on development (BSID3) and nurturing environment (HOME) [in Aim 1]; (c)&#xD;
      Adoption: proportion of workers/facilities participating, CHW characteristics; (d)&#xD;
      Implementation: contact hours/visit completion, fidelity to delivery protocols; (e)&#xD;
      Maintenance: patient outcomes and cost effectiveness analysis at 12-24 months [in Aim 3];&#xD;
      intent by decision makers and implementers to continue intervention. In addition, the&#xD;
      investigators will conduct a sequential quantitative--&gt;qualitative explanatory analysis,&#xD;
      using interviews and focus groups with implementers from clusters with highest/lowest impact&#xD;
      outcomes (BSID3/HOME) to explore institutional inner and outer setting and implementation&#xD;
      processes associated with intervention success, using the Consolidated Framework for&#xD;
      Implementation Research (CFIR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: Conduct an economic evaluation of the GMCD intervention. Evaluation will&#xD;
      assess (a) costs of the interventions at 12 and 24 months; and (b) cost-effectiveness of the&#xD;
      intervention (dollar per unit increase in BSID or HOME scores) at 12 months. This analysis&#xD;
      will provide cost information to policymakers to help guide resource allocation decisions for&#xD;
      ECD interventions.&#xD;
