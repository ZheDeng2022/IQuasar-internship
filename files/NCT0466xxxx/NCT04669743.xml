  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death in the&#xD;
      United States. Patients with COPD are routinely exposed to indoor and outdoor air pollution,&#xD;
      which appears to cause escalation of their respiratory symptoms, a process called&#xD;
      exacerbation, with resulting need to seek medical attention. This research plan proposes to&#xD;
      evaluate the impact of lung immune cells in susceptibility to develop exacerbation through an&#xD;
      experimental model of inhalational exposure using ambient levels of a component of air&#xD;
      pollution (ozone) in COPD patients and longitudinal sampling of their lung immune cells.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A major cause of morbidity and mortality in COPD is exacerbation. The mechanisms underlying&#xD;
      COPD exacerbation are poorly understood, but airway innate immune system has been implicated&#xD;
      in its development. Air pollution contributes to development of COPD exacerbation, and&#xD;
      exposure to ozone, a major component of air pollution, is associated with increased&#xD;
      healthcare utilization among patients with COPD. Inhalation of ambient levels of ozone is&#xD;
      known to affect airway innate immune system. This proposal sets out to characterize and&#xD;
      investigate the role of innate immune system and in particular airway macrophages in&#xD;
      ozone-induced COPD exacerbation through establishing an experimental model that employs&#xD;
      controlled ozone exposure and longitudinal sampling via bronchoscopy. The research plan&#xD;
      proposes to examine human immune cells trafficking in airways during the process of&#xD;
      ozone-induced airway injury and inflammation in patients with COPD. The investigator's&#xD;
      overall hypothesis is that inhalational challenge to a high ambient level of ozone in&#xD;
      patients with COPD provides a safe human model of airway injury with resulting intraluminal&#xD;
      shifts in the population and polarization of macrophages to study innate immunity processes&#xD;
      relevant to ozone-induced COPD exacerbation.&#xD;

    <description>Subjects will be recruited and consented following screening. Subjects will be characterized into cohorts based on presence of COPD and smoking status. All subjects enrolled will be undergoing the same interventions: 1st Bronchoscopy (3 wks pre-exposure), Ozone Exposure, 2nd Bronchoscopy (1 day post-exposure), 3rd Bronchoscopy (5 days post-exposure). Ozone exposure will take place in an exposure chamber.</description>

    <description>Exposures will take place at the UCSF Human Exposure Chamber Core Facility. Ozone will be added to the air in the chamber and concentration measured every 30 seconds. Subjects will exercise for two 15-minute intervals of each hour on a cycle ergometer, and will rest for two 15-minute intervals between exercise sessions. The rate of exercise will be individually adjusted to produce a targeted minute ventilation of 15-20 L/min/m2 body surface area. Subjects will be sent home post-exposure and will return to the laboratory on the following day and six days after the exposure for bronchoscopy.</description>

        During subject screening visit, Albuterol is used to determine whether the subjects have&#xD;
        COPD based on the Global Initiative on Obstructive Lung Diseases (GOLD) criteria.&#xD;
        Regardless of whether the subject has reversibility to Albuterol or not, if they have an&#xD;
        abnormal ratio after inhalation of Albuterol, they would meet the GOLD criteria for COPD&#xD;
        and will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. History of IV drug use or inhalation of recreational drugs other than marijuana:&#xD;
