    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to evaluate if occlusal stabilization splints equilibrated by&#xD;
      articulating paper will have equivalent effect in comparison to occlusal stabilization&#xD;
      splints equilibrated by T-scan regarding the relief of the TMD signs and symptoms&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Eligible patient will be selected from Outpatient Clinic in Prosthodontics Department clinic.&#xD;
      Patients will be informed of the nature of the research work and informed consent will be&#xD;
      obtained from each of them.All patients will be assessed for TMJ health following DC/TMD Axis&#xD;
      I and II to confirm the diagnosis . Base line pain scale and range of pain free jaw movements&#xD;
      (mm) will be recorded before starting the treatment. Patients will be randomly divided into 2&#xD;
      equal groups; occlusal stabilization splints equilibrated by articulating paper and occlusal&#xD;
      stabilization splints equilibrated by T-scan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients of both groups will be subjected to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary impressions will be taken using rubber base impression material (Zhermac zetaplus&#xD;
      impression material) ,the impressions will be poured twice to construct 2 study casts to be&#xD;
      used for final occlusal adjustment of the splint. Maxillary Face-bow record will be done to&#xD;
      mount both maxillary casts on a semi adjustable articulator (A7-Plus Bio Art semi-adjustable&#xD;
      articulator) using different mounting rings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bite registration using bite registration material (Futar D Bite Registration Material -&#xD;
      Ultra Rigid from Kettenbach LP ) will be done in centric relation after deprogramming the&#xD;
      muscles using acrylic jig or leaf gauges, followed by loading test for condyle position&#xD;
      verification 7to mount the mandibular cast. A protrusive record will be made at 6 mm&#xD;
      mandibular protrusion to set the horizontal condylar guidance, while lateral condylar&#xD;
      guidance will be adjusted at fixed value of 15 degrees.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The centric relation will be verified by comparing the first point of contact intraorally and&#xD;
      the first point of contact on the articulator will be verified. The maxillary cast will be&#xD;
      surveyed to detect teeth height of contour. The borders of the occlusal splint will be drawn&#xD;
      on the maxillary cast to be occlusal to the height of contour buccally and to extend 1-2 mm&#xD;
      beyond the gingival margin on the palatal surface. As the jaw relation and mounting will be&#xD;
      done by leaf gauges and at elevated vertical dimension, the incisal pin will be kept on zero.&#xD;
      The appliance will be waxed up by filling the inter-arch space with pink wax placed will&#xD;
      taper it to a feather edge to the previously drawn borders. A complete arch coverage design&#xD;
      will be done and will be shaped to be flat. The wax will be checked with 20 um thick&#xD;
      articulating paper (AccuFilm, parkell, USA)and should produce bilateral posterior contacts in&#xD;
      coincidence with physiologic condylar seating and a smooth anterior guidance in excursions&#xD;
      allowing posterior disocclusion2&#xD;
&#xD;
      A mould for the shaped wax will be done using Polyvinyl silicone elastomer putty material&#xD;
      (elite P&amp;P, Italy) in a plastic container. A white self-cured acrylic resin (Acrostone cold&#xD;
      cure material) will be mixed and filled inside the mould and will be closed tightly till all&#xD;
      excess comes out. After material setting the acrylic occlusal splint will be finished and&#xD;
      seated on the duplicated cast and final fit and occlusal correction using 20 um thick&#xD;
      articulating paper (AccuFilm, parkell, USA) will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the next clinical visit the splint will be inserted inside patient's mouth and will be&#xD;
      checked for stability and comfort before any occlusal adjustment which will be performed by&#xD;
      articulating paper or T-Scan according to the assigned groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this group the final occlusal correction will be performed with the patient in supine&#xD;
      position using 20 um thick articulating paper (AccuFilm, parkell, USA) and articulating foil&#xD;
      (DENU shim stock, HDI) 8 um thick. The patient will be asked to tap 3 times on the&#xD;
      articulating paper and occlusal correction will be done using carbide laboratory bur and&#xD;
      rubber cone till uniform contact on all teeth is achieved in centric relation which is&#xD;
      illustrated on the splint by a series of uniformly appearing articulating paper dots. Then&#xD;
      the patient will be asked to make protrusive and right and left excursions to ensure smooth&#xD;
      anterior guidance and posterior disocclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this group the same adjustment sequence will be done using T Scan III (software version&#xD;
      8.0) computerized occlusal analysis, a new patient file will be opened, the patient's&#xD;
      biological data will be entered, and the T Scan dental arch size is customized to fit the&#xD;
      patients arch anatomy. A centric occlusion scan label with Turbo mode (0.003 second&#xD;
      incremental scanning) scan speed will be selected. The sensor will be placed intraorally so&#xD;
      that the midline 'V' of the support contacts the midline of the occlusal splint. The patient&#xD;
      is then asked to gently close on their posterior teeth, then clench firmly against the&#xD;
      occlusal splint for one to three seconds. The sensitivity level will be adjusted to fit the&#xD;
      patient's occlusal strength. When the sensitivity is properly set, the patient will be asked&#xD;
      to clench&#xD;
&#xD;
      to record occlusal force and areas that needs adjustment will be grinded using the paper&#xD;
      marks as the guideline and carbide laboratory bur till bilateral force balance achieved and&#xD;
      the center of force (COF) icon sits close to the midline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mandibular excursions are then adjusted in a similar fashion. The appropriate excursion scan&#xD;
      label will be chosen, after which the patient is asked to clench on their posterior teeth for&#xD;
      one to three seconds, and then move in a lateral or protrusive excursion to the full extent&#xD;
      of the border movement. Contacts rather than anterior and canine guidance will be eliminated&#xD;
      till achieving anterior guidance and posterior disocclusion in time less than 0.5 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After occlusal adjustment in centric relation, the occlusion will be evaluated in upright&#xD;
      position and will ensure that patient bites comfortably and that all teeth contact evenly,&#xD;
      with no anterior teeth contacting harder than the posterior teeth. No polishing will be done&#xD;
      after adjustment for maintenance of the refined occlusal contacts. The patients will be&#xD;
      instructed to wear the occlusal splint at nighttime, to alleviate daytime harmful habits, the&#xD;
      patients will be instructed to seal the lips and separate the teeth, keeping the muscles&#xD;
      relaxed. The patients will be recalled every after 1 week and every 2 weeks for further&#xD;
      needed occlusal adjustment till there is no change at all between visits&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 1 month and 3 months, the patients will be recalled to evaluate the improvements in TMD&#xD;
      pain symptoms using questionnaires, in addition to the improvement in range of pain free jaw&#xD;
      movements using mm ruler.&#xD;
