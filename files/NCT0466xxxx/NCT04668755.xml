  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the therapeutic effect of the Charcot Restraint&#xD;
      Orthotic Walker three-dimensional printed sole on Charcot foot ulcer healing.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Foot ulcerations, Charcot neuroarthropathy, and peripheral arterial disease frequently result&#xD;
      in gangrene and lower limb amputation. Consequently, foot disorders are leading causes of&#xD;
      hospitalization for persons with peripheral neuropathy. Although not all foot complications&#xD;
      can be prevented, dramatic reductions in frequency have been achieved by taking a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary approach to patient management, The reduction of pressure to the Charcot&#xD;
      foot ulcer is essential to treatment. Proper off-loading and pressure reduction prevents&#xD;
      further trauma and promotes healing. This is particularly important in the peripheral&#xD;
      neuropathy patient with decreased or absent sensation in the lower extremities. Furthermore,&#xD;
      recent studies provide evidence that minor trauma (eg, repetitive stress, shoe pressure)&#xD;
      plays a major role in the causal pathway to ulceration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Off-loading approaches that deal with Charcot neuroarthropathy will decrease the&#xD;
           significant psychological, social and functional impact on individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The need of this study is developed from the lack of controlled studies that reported&#xD;
           the therapeutic effect of Charcot Restraint Orthotic Walker 3d printed sole on Charcot&#xD;
           foot ulcer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  So the present study is designed to evaluate the Charcot Restraint Orthotic Walker 3d&#xD;
           printed sole on Charcot foot ulcer. Furthermore, the current study may help physical&#xD;
           therapist, physicians, and clinicians to organize a protocol of treatment that would be&#xD;
           safe, simple and economic for treating patients with Charcot neuroarthropathy.&#xD;

A photographs were taken including the reference ruler in the images that is captured for the whole wound margins taking in consideration standardization the same angle of capture in the flat mid foot ulcers, but in case of ulcers extend to foot edge, a sterilized transparent grid film (1x1 cm) attached flat on the ulcer then wound margins traced on the transparent grid film and then photographed, then the captured photographs is exported to the computer to be visualized with ImageJ 1.52t software. Surface area measurement of wound margins are traced by the same investigator to establish reliability of measurements</description>

    <description>It is a clamshell (two piece) design that provides complete/total contact over the shin, calf and foot. The CROW reduces all motion in the ankle and foot to reduce potential for further injury. It is fully padded on the inside, and the bottom is covered with a material similar to shoe soling. It is not worn with a shoe.</description>
