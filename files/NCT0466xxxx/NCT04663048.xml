    <textblock>
      To assess the improvement in myopia with phototherapeutic intrastromal corneal collagen&#xD;
      cross-linking (PiXL) without epithelial debridement (epi-on) in high oxygen environment for&#xD;
      low grade myopia. The study compares two 3.5-mm central ring-shaped zone protocols; 10 min&#xD;
      illumination time vs 16:40 min illumination time.&#xD;

      The study design is a prospective, single-masked intraindividually comparing randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial, conducted at the Department of Clinical Sciences / Ophthalmology, Umeå&#xD;
      University Hospital, Umeå, Sweden. The study includes healthy men and women with low grade&#xD;
      myopia, aged between 18-35 years and involves 25 participants with a myopia of -0.50 to -2.5&#xD;
      diopters (D) and astigmatism of ≤0.75D. All participants are treated with phototherapeutic&#xD;
      intrastromal corneal collagen cross-linking (PiXL) without epithelial debridement (epi-on),&#xD;
      after topical riboflavin. Both eyes are treated and randomized to receive ultraviolet (UV)&#xD;
      light according to PiXL Protocol A in one eye and PiXL Protocol B in the other, which is&#xD;
      masked to the participant. Throughout the treatment, humidified oxygen is continuously&#xD;
      delivered around the eye using an oxygen mask to achieve an oxygen concentration of ≥95&#xD;
      percentage. Prior to inclusion all participants are informed about the procedures and provide&#xD;
      oral and written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline, each eye is examined with slit-lamp microscopy, subjective refraction,&#xD;
      determination of uncorrected (UCVA), low contrast visual acuity at 2.5 percentage and 10&#xD;
      percentage contrast and best corrected (BSCVA) visual acuities using the LogMAR fast protocol&#xD;
      and intraocular pressure (IOP) using Goldmann applanation tonometry. Under standardized,&#xD;
      mesopic light conditions each eye is evaluated by keratometry readings, central corneal&#xD;
      thickness and after treatment also the depth of demarcation lines, extracted from Schemipflug&#xD;
      camera measurements, Pentacam HR® (Oculus, Inc. Lynnwood, WA). Central corneal endothelial&#xD;
      photographs are taken with the Topcon SP-2000P specular microscope (Topcon Europe B.V.,&#xD;
      Capelle a/d Ijssel, the Netherlands), from which the corneal endothelial cell count is&#xD;
      manually calculated from a cluster of 25 cells from each photograph. Total ocular wavefront&#xD;
      is measured with iTrace (Tracey Technologies, Inc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the above mentioned examinations are reassessed at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after treatment.&#xD;
      At 1 day and 1 week after treatment, solely UCVA, Auto refractor measurements, slit-lamp&#xD;
      examination and a subjective comparison of discomfort and visual performance in each eye are&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;
