  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ischemia-guided revascularization is the cornerstone of contemporary management of coronary&#xD;
      artery disease (CAD). Coronary physiological assessment is advocated in the catheter&#xD;
      laboratory to guide percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and it is widely accepted that&#xD;
      an FFR ≤ 0.80 is a good indicator for vessels to benefit from revascularization.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, a significant proportion of PCI patients continue to experience adverse events&#xD;
      related to both stented segment and/or residual or diffuse disease. Our group recently&#xD;
      demonstrated the feasibility of pullback pressure gradient (PPG) derived from virtual&#xD;
      Quantitative Flow Ratio (QFR) pullback curve, which is an index of atherosclerosis functional&#xD;
      pattern and can be used to epitomize the pathophysiological pattern of CAD as focal or&#xD;
      diffuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this regard, the current study will investigate the incremental value of PPG added to QFR&#xD;
      haemodynamic assessment in ischemia-causing vessels received PCI in predicting adverse&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;

&#xD;
      The study cohort is derived from the PANDA-III study (Comparison of BuMA eG Based&#xD;
      BioDegradable Polymer Stent With EXCEL Biodegradable Polymer Sirolimus-eluting Stent in&#xD;
      &quot;Real-World&quot; Practice) (NCT02017275). In this cohort, vessels with measurable QFR≤ 0.80 will&#xD;
      be included. According to the PPG index calculated from QFR virtual pullback curve and&#xD;
      treatment strategy chosen, the included vessels were divided into three groups(vessels with&#xD;
      PCI strategy and low PPG index (group A), vessels with PCI strategy with high PPG index&#xD;
      (group B) and vessels with conservative strategy (group C)) and 2-year clinical outcomes for&#xD;
      each group will be compared.&#xD;
