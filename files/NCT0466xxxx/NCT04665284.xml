      Muslim population with type II diabetes mellitus.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is the one of the most common non-communicable diseases affecting 425 million adults&#xD;
      worldwide. This figure is expected to rise to 629 million by the year 2045.1 90% of the&#xD;
      diabetic population has type 2 diabetes. 2 As of 2018, more than 500 million individuals are&#xD;
      residing with type 2 diabetes mellitus globally. 3 In Pakistan, the situation is similarly&#xD;
      alarming. According to a recent survey, 16.98% of the Pakistani population has diabetes.4 The&#xD;
      primary target of therapy in diabetes mellitus is optimum blood glucose control. In case of&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes, this is achieved by a combination of oral hypoglycemic agents and injectable&#xD;
      drugs with insulin as a last resort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of oral agents targeting various sites of action are available. Sodium-glucose&#xD;
      cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are newer class of drugs that have been introduced. They&#xD;
      have a unique mechanism of action. By acting at the sodium glucose co-transporter, they block&#xD;
      the reabsorption of glucose leading to an increase in urinary glucose excretion and lowering&#xD;
      of plasma glucose.5 This action is completely independent of the beta cell function. There&#xD;
      are several theoretical advantages to this approach. In addition to lowering blood glucose,&#xD;
      the urinary glucose excretion results in loss of calories and weight reduction and the&#xD;
      associated osmotic diuretic effect can aid in lowering blood pressures.6,7 Numerous studies&#xD;
      have demonstrated a favorable risk benefit ratio of empagliflozin as monotherapy8 as well as&#xD;
      add-on therapy to other hypoglycemic agents.9,10,11,12 They also have additional&#xD;
      cardiovascular benefits with several studies documenting a reduction in mortality.13,14&#xD;
      Moreover, the sodium glucose co-transporters also demonstrated a reduction in the onset and&#xD;
      worsening of nephropathy and preservation of renal function.15 This effect is not restricted&#xD;
      to empagliflozin alone, as other drugs in the class have also demonstrated this benefit.16&#xD;
      Empagliflozin with its novel mechanism of action has its own set of side effects. Increased&#xD;
      urinary glucose losses lead to a higher proportion of urinary tract infections and genital&#xD;
      tract infections. This has been evidenced in various studies.17 The osmotic diuresis that&#xD;
      benefits in lowering blood pressures at one end, also predisposes the patients to volume&#xD;
      depletion.Empagliflozin, one of the three drugs from this class, approved by the FDA for&#xD;
      treatment of type 2 diabetes. According to the recent ADA and the EASD guidelines, they have&#xD;
      become an essential component of the algorithm recommended for managing type 2 diabetes.18&#xD;
      The recently published consensus statement by the South Asian Federation of Endocrine&#xD;
      Societies has incorporated sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors in the treatment of&#xD;
      patients with type 2 diabetes as monotherapy in patients who are intolerant to or have any&#xD;
      contraindication to metformin therapy. Additionally, drugs belonging to this class are also&#xD;
      recommended as combination therapy with other oral hypoglycemic agents as well as insulin.19&#xD;
      Empagliflozin, however, has not been studied in the Pakistani population as yet. The main aim&#xD;
      of this study is to establish the efficacy and safety of empagliflozin in optimum control of&#xD;
      blood sugar in type 2 diabetes. This is the first study of its kind being performed in the&#xD;
      Pakistani population.&#xD;

    <description>The instrument provides an overall scale score, as well as two subscale scores for 1) satisfaction with treatment, 2) adherence with Self Care Regimen. 15 Items are scored on a 5-point Likert scale and are of two general formats.One format asks about the frequency of negative impact of diabetes itself or of the diabetes treatment and provides response options from 1 (never) to 5 (all the time). The second format asks about satisfaction with treatment and quality of life and is scored from 1 (very satisfied) to 5 (very dissatisfied). Higher scores on DQOL items and subscales are, therefore, negatively valenced, indicating problem frequency or dissatisfaction.</description>
