      The main objective is to describe the rate of asymptomatic patients after 5 days of effective&#xD;
      antibiotic therapy in an uncomplicated febrile urinary tract infection in children between 3&#xD;
      months and 18 years of age.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomised prospective monocentric pilot study whose main objective is to&#xD;
      describe the proportion of asymptomatic patients after 5 days of effective antibiotic therapy&#xD;
      in an uncomplicated febrile urinary tract infection, in children between 3 months and 18&#xD;
      years of age. After being informed about the study, all patient meeting inclusion criteria&#xD;
      will respond to a survey at D2, D5, D10 and D28 to evaluate the persistence of symptoms to&#xD;
      determine the effectiveness of a 5-day course of antibiotic treatment. All patients will be&#xD;
      treated in accordance to the French guidelines.&#xD;

    <description>The main evaluation criteria aims to determine the effectiveness of a 5-day course of antibiotic treatment. Treatment failure is characterised by the presence at Day 5 of clinical signs (abdominal pain, urinary functional signs, urinary burns) and/or a fever ≥ at 38°C and/or a new positive cytobacteriological urine test performed after antibiotic therapy due to the persistence and/or reappearance of symptoms.</description>
