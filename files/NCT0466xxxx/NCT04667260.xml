  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Implant placement in posterior maxilla is often compromised or impossible due to atrophy of&#xD;
      the bone and pneumatisation of the maxillary sinus. Thus, alveolar ridge augmentation is&#xD;
      frequently necessary. The most commonly used method to augment the maxillary region involves&#xD;
      the maxillary sinus floor augmentation (MSFA) with autogenous bone graft or bone substitute.&#xD;
      Harvesting of autogenous bone graft is associated with risk of donor site morbidity and&#xD;
      unpredictable resorption of the graft. Thus, bone substitutes alone or in combination with&#xD;
      autogenous bone are used increasingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symbios xenograft granules is a new porcine bone mineral. Long-term studies have demonstrated&#xD;
      that xenograft contains osteoconductive properties and is a safe grafting material. MSFA with&#xD;
      xenograft alone or in combination with autogenous bone have shown high implant survival with&#xD;
      new bone formation. In contrast, the maxillary sinus cavities possess significant potential&#xD;
      for bone regeneration without the use of additional bone grafts or bone substitutes due to&#xD;
      the principle of periosteal guided bone regeneration and surrounding bony walls. Bone&#xD;
      regeneration after maxillary sinus membrane elevation with the use of coagulum as grafting&#xD;
      material has shown high implant survival with new bone formation, as documented in reviews&#xD;
      and short-term studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is to test the H0-hypothesis of no difference in the long-term implant outcome&#xD;
      after MSFA with 1:1 mixture of autogenous bone graft and Symbios xenograft (control) compared&#xD;
      with the coagulum (test). Forty consecutively healthy patients with a missing posterior&#xD;
      maxillary tooth will be allocated to test or control. Implants will be inserted&#xD;
      simultaneously with the MSFA. Clinical and/or radiographical evaluation using periapical&#xD;
      radiographs and Cone Beam Computer Tomography (CBCT) will be performed preoperatively,&#xD;
      immediate postoperatively, before abutment connection, after prosthetic rehabilitation, and&#xD;
      one year after loading to assess the implant treatment outcome and the volumetric changes of&#xD;
      the augmented area. The primary outcome will include survival of suprastructures, survival of&#xD;
      implants, volumetric stability of the augmented area, peri-implant marginal bone level, oral&#xD;
      health related quality of life, and complications related to the two treatment modalities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Maxillary sinus floor augmentation (MSFA) is used to enhance the alveolar bone height of the&#xD;
      posterior maxilla. Autogenous bone is the preferred graft material. Dental implants inserted&#xD;
      in sinuses augmented with autogenous bone grafts have demonstrated high implant survival.&#xD;
      However, autogenous bone grafts is associated with risk of donor site morbidity and&#xD;
      unpredictable graft resorption. Hence, various bone substitutes alone or in combination with&#xD;
      autogenous bone graft are used to simplify the surgical procedure by diminishing the need for&#xD;
      bone harvesting. Reviews have reported high survival of suprastructures and implants after&#xD;
      MSFA with different mixtures of autogenous bone graft and bone substitutes. Xenograft is a&#xD;
      tissue graft transplanted from another species than humans. MSFA with xenograft alone or in&#xD;
      combination with autogenous bone graft have demonstrated high survival of suprastructures and&#xD;
      implants. Symbios xenograft granules (Dentsply, United Kingdom) is a new porcine bone mineral&#xD;
      characterized as an anorganic bone matrix with an interconnecting pore structure that&#xD;
      supports formation and in-growth of new bone. A short-term study comparing autogenous bone&#xD;
      graft with porcine bone alone or a mixture of autogenous bone and porcine bone indicated that&#xD;
      porcine bone alone or in combination with autologous bone is biocompatible and&#xD;
      osteoconductive and can be successfully used for MSFA. However, the long-term implant&#xD;
      survival after MSFA with autogenous bone graft in combination with Symbios xenograft granules&#xD;
      is presently unknown. In contrast, it has been postulated that bone formation in the&#xD;
      maxillary sinus does not require the presence of a grafting material. The maintenance of&#xD;
      space for blood clot formation accompanied by the resorption and deposition of bone cells&#xD;
      derived from the sinus periosteum or cancellous bone of the maxilla would be responsible for&#xD;
      bone formation. Moreover, high implant survival rate, limited peri-implant marginal bone&#xD;
      loss, few biological and technical complications has been documented after MSFA with blood&#xD;
      coagulum as grafting material. However, only few short-term studies have compared MSFA with&#xD;
      blood coagulum and autogenous bone graft or bone substitutes. Therefore, it is presently&#xD;
      unknown how much bone regeneration and grafting is necessary for long-term functional implant&#xD;
      stability after MSFA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose Test the H0-hypothesis of no difference in implant treatment outcome after MSFA with&#xD;
      a 1:1 mixture of autogenous bone graft and Symbios xenograft granules compared with blood&#xD;
      coagulum as grafting material. Assessment will include survival of suprastructures and&#xD;
      implants, changes in peri-implant marginal bone level, volumetrical stability of the graft&#xD;
      material and treatment related complications after an observation period of one year. Oral&#xD;
      health related quality of life (OHIP-14) and patient satisfaction will also be assessed using&#xD;
      questionnaire and visual analogue scales (VAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test the H0 hypothesis of no differences in:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Survival of suprastructures and implants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Volumetrical stability of the graft.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Peri-implant marginal bone level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Implantat stability quotient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient-reported outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Survival of suprastructures. Loss of suprastructures is defined as a total loss because&#xD;
           of a non-treatable mechanical/or biological complication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Survival of implants. Loss of implants is defined as removal of a non-integrated&#xD;
           implant, mobility of previously clinical osseointegrated implant, and removal of&#xD;
           non-mobile implants due to progressive peri-implant marginal bone loss and infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Volumetric changes of the graft.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Peri-implant marginal bone level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient-reported outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complications e.g. loosening of crown and fractures of veneer ceramic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods Forty consecutively healthy patients with a missing posterior maxillary&#xD;
      tooth will be included and randomly allocated to: 1) MSFA with a 1:1 mixture of autogenous&#xD;
      bone graft and Symbios xenograft granules (control group) or 2) blood coagulum (test group).&#xD;
      Patients will be included using a Facebook posting through the University's Facebook page,&#xD;
      the local dental association website or patients that are referred to the Department of Oral&#xD;
      and Maxillofacial Surgery, Aalborg University Hospital for treatment of a missing tooth in&#xD;
      the posterior maxilla. All patients will be offered participation in the study, if they meet&#xD;
      the inclusion criteria. Prior to patients' first visit, they will receive a notice informing&#xD;
      about their rights to have a person of their choice to be present during the visit for&#xD;
      consultation if they wish. When the patients arrive for their first visit they will be given&#xD;
      verbal information about the study and the written information given prior to their first&#xD;
      visit will be elaborated. They will also receive an informed consent form. Finally, patients&#xD;
      will be informed that they are free to terminate their participation in the study at any&#xD;
      given time without any explanation and it will not affect their further treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CBCT is frequently used before and after installation of implants in conjunction with MSFA.&#xD;
      Included patients will receive an increased radiation dose, since CBCT scanning in addition&#xD;
      to enoral radiographs are obtained to compare the treatment modalities. Seven CBCT with a&#xD;
      total dose of 0.609 mSV, one orthopantomogram with a dose of 0.021 mSV and seven enoral&#xD;
      radiographs with a total dose of 0.056 mSV will be obtained and the total effective dose will&#xD;
      be 0.686 mSV. The standard radiation dose for MSFA with a similar observation period would be&#xD;
      0.251 mSV. Patients participating in the study will therefore receive a higher radiation dose&#xD;
      of 0.435 mSV compared to a standard treatment. The extra radiation that each patient in the&#xD;
      study is exposed to equals 1 month of background radiation. The risk of getting cancer caused&#xD;
      by radiation is 0.005% per 1 mSV. The study will include a total of 40 patients; each patient&#xD;
      will receive an extra dose of 0.435 mSV in comparison to patients not participating in this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial examination of the patient will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical examination and screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Missing one posterior maxillary tooth (&gt;4 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Need of one implant in the posterior maxilla.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adjacent tooth in opposite jaw in contact with planned crown.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Plaque and gingival index, probing pocket depth, and probing attachment level of the&#xD;
           adjacent tooth/teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiographical examination of the residual alveolar bone based on CBCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Orthopantomography to document the pre-treatment status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient will fill out the OHIP-14 questionnaire. The surgical procedure will be&#xD;
           performed in local anesthesia with or without oral sedation or in general anesthesia&#xD;
           with nasotracheal intubation. Implant installation and fabrication of the subsequently&#xD;
           prosthetic solution will be performed according to manufacturer's recommendations. The&#xD;
           maxillary sinus wall is exposed by an intraoral marginal incision from tuber maxillae to&#xD;
           the first premolar with a vertical releasing incision. A 1 x 1 cm bony window to the&#xD;
           maxillary sinus is created with burs maintaining an intact Schneiderian membrane. The&#xD;
           membrane is elevated from the sinus floor as well as the lateral sinus wall and&#xD;
           displaced dorsocranially with blunt dissector. An implant bed is successively prepared&#xD;
           on the top of the alveolar crest following manufactory's recommendations. A straight&#xD;
           dental implant is inserted with a cover screw. The implant stability quotient is&#xD;
           measured for all inserted implants. A sealed randomization envelope is opened in order&#xD;
           to allocate the patient to: 1) 1:1 mixture of autogenous bone graft and Symbios&#xD;
           xenograft granules or 2) blood coagulum. The autogenous bone graft is harvested with a&#xD;
           curved SafeScraper from the zygomatic buttress. Specially prepared stainless steel cup&#xD;
           are used to estimate 1 cm3 of particulated autogenous bone graft, which will be mixed&#xD;
           with 1 ml of Symbios xenograft granules (0.25-1 mm) and soaked in autogenous blood until&#xD;
           use. Approximately two ml blood coagulum will be sucked from the surgical area. In the&#xD;
           control group, the sinus around the implant is packed with the 1:1 mixture of autogenous&#xD;
           bone graft and Symbios xenograft granules. In the test group, the sinus around the&#xD;
           implant is filled with a two ml blood coagulum around the inserted implant. Periosteum&#xD;
           and mucosa are sutured with Vicryl 4-0. No provisional restoration is inserted during&#xD;
           the healing period. Patient questionnaire will be filled out after one week and one&#xD;
           month. After six months of healing, inserted implants are exposed via a crestal incision&#xD;
           and implant stability quotient is measured before healing abutment is placed. Mucosa is&#xD;
           adapted and sutured with Vicryl 4-0. The prosthetic restoration will be initiated three&#xD;
           weeks after the healing abutment has been placed including individualized abutment and&#xD;
           fixed restoration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be scheduled for a postoperative clinical examination after one year of loading&#xD;
      involving:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Plaque and gingival index, probing pocket depth, and probing attachment level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oral health related quality of life - OHIP-14.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient satisfaction (VAS). Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP) is a questionnaire&#xD;
           designed to measure impairment of oral health related quality of life and focuses on the&#xD;
           frequency of complaints regarding the general dentition over a course of time. However,&#xD;
           OHIP states the patient's overall oral impairment, and does not take a specific&#xD;
           treatment site into account. Therefore, additional questionnaire including VAS may be&#xD;
           used to evaluate the area of a missing tooth and/or a tooth replacement. The total&#xD;
           implant treatment, peri-implant soft tissues, implant crown, and implant function at the&#xD;
           follow-up examination will be assessed using a systematic questionnaire. Each question&#xD;
           will be scored on a 100-mm VAS with 0 indicating extreme dissatisfaction and 100&#xD;
           indicating complete satisfaction. The VAS scores will be measured to the nearest mm by a&#xD;
           ruler.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiographical evaluation will include seven sets of periapical radiographs and CBCT-scan&#xD;
      obtained preoperatively, immediately postoperatively, after abutment connection and after 1&#xD;
      year of loading. To provide blinding of the radiographical evaluation, the CBCT-scans are&#xD;
      coded. Volumetrical changes of the grafts are estimated by point counting and the method&#xD;
      described originally by Cavalieri. To obtain an equivalent starting point for the systematic&#xD;
      uniform random sampling of the CBCT-scans images involving the maxillary sinus, all images&#xD;
      from the neighboring teeth to the implant bed are selected. The first CBCT images after the&#xD;
      distal surface of the anterior neighboring tooth is sampled randomly using a random number&#xD;
      table for each maxillary sinus. Every second CBCT image is selected to ensure an equal mutual&#xD;
      distance between the selected 5-10 images. The original outline of the maxillary sinus before&#xD;
      implant installation is recorded and superimposed on the corresponding images. A point grid&#xD;
      test system is superimposed at random on all images, allowing 100-200 points to hit the graft&#xD;
      of each maxillary sinus. The numbers of intersections over the graft are counted on each&#xD;
      selected image. Cavalieri volume estimation principle is used to estimate the total volume of&#xD;
      the graft.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peri-implant marginal bone changes are evaluated by linear measurements on digital periapical&#xD;
      radiographs at implant placement, baseline and one year after loading. The distance from the&#xD;
      implant-abutment connection to the marginal bone level will be measured mesially and distally&#xD;
      parallel with the long-axis of the implant.&#xD;
