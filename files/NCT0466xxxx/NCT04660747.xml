  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Patients with cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) are currently treated with&#xD;
      anticoagulants during 3-12 months after diagnosis, to prevent worsening of the CVT and&#xD;
      recurrent thrombosis, and to promote venous recanalization. Until recently, patients were&#xD;
      generally treated with vitamin K antagonists (VKA). Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are&#xD;
      more practical in use than VKA and carry a lower risk of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) in&#xD;
      other conditions. One of the burning clinical questions is whether CVT patients can be safely&#xD;
      treated with DOACs instead of VKA. In 2019, the first randomized trial on the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of DOACs in CVT was published (RESPECT-CVT). This exploratory study included 120&#xD;
      patients and the results suggest that DOACs can be safely used to treat CVT. Following&#xD;
      RESPECT-CVT, use of DOACs to treat CVT is expected to rise, but given the limited sample size&#xD;
      and strict selection criteria of RESPECT-CVT, additional data regarding the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of DOACs in CVT are required, especially from routine clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To assess the safety and efficacy of DOACs for the treatment of CVT in a&#xD;
      real-world setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: DOAC-CVT will be an international, prospective, comparative cohort study. We&#xD;
      aim to recruit 500 patients and anticipating a 3:2 ratio in DOAC:VKA use, we expect that in&#xD;
      total 300 patients treated with a DOAC will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Patients are eligible if they are &gt;18 years old, have a radiologically&#xD;
      confirmed CVT, and have started oral anticoagulant treatment (DOAC or VKA) within 30 days of&#xD;
      CVT diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary study endpoint: The primary endpoint is a composite of major bleeding (according to&#xD;
      the criteria of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis) AND symptomatic&#xD;
      recurrent venous thrombosis after 6 months of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation: This is an&#xD;
      observational study which poses no risk or burden to the participant. Only data that are&#xD;
      collected as part of routine clinical care will be used.&#xD;
