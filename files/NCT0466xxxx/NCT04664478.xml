      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elastic fibers affect parts of the body that stretch repetitively, such as the skin, blood&#xD;
      vessels, and lungs. Researchers want to use medical and research tests in patients with&#xD;
      already identified changes in a set of connective tissue genes to better understand diseases&#xD;
      related to elastic fibers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn more about the impact of underlying changes in a set of connective tissue genes on&#xD;
      people s overall health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 2-100 who have had a gene test that identified a change in a gene that affects&#xD;
      elastic fibers. Initial emphasis will be placed on people with changes in ELN, LOX, MFAP4,&#xD;
      FBLN5 and EFEMP2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will visit the NIH for several days to perform tests that will help researchers&#xD;
      learn more about how changes in connective tissue genes affect a person s health. They will&#xD;
      also have clinicians take their medical history and physical exam. Optional tests include&#xD;
      giving blood samples, hair strand, urine, and/or saliva samples. They may have a cheek swab&#xD;
      or skin biopsy. Their genes may be studied. Their cells may be grown in a laboratory.&#xD;
      Participants may have photographs taken of the face and body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will receive exams by a medical team with experience in connective tissue disease. They&#xD;
      may have a dental exam or eye exams and with photography. During the eye exam, pictures may&#xD;
      be taken of the blood vessels in the eyes. If this occurs, they will get dye through an&#xD;
      intravenous (IV) line in an arm vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will also have medical tests to check the health of tissues that may be affected by&#xD;
      these connective tissue genes. Participants may have lung function tests. They may have a&#xD;
      six-minute walk test. They may complete a treadmill or bike stress test. Their heart s&#xD;
      electrical activity may be recorded. Participants may have X-rays and ultrasounds. They may&#xD;
      have a DEXA scan to measure bone density. They may have CT, MRI or other imaging scans. Some&#xD;
      of these tests require the participant to get a contrast fluid via IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have a skin elasticity test using a suction cup that pulls lightly on their&#xD;
      skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may wear blood pressure cuffs while probes are placed on their skin. The tests&#xD;
      will be chosen for each individual based on their specific gene change and no person is&#xD;
      expected to complete all tests. Participation will last 3-5 days.&#xD;

      Study Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol will allow deep phenotyping of patients with underlying gene variation in a set&#xD;
      of connective tissue genes (see Appendix A for list) to both quantify risk of specific&#xD;
      disease features and to describe novel phenotypes attributable to gene variation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: Phenotypic description for patients with known variation in specified&#xD;
      connective tissue genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective: Within and across gene correlation of variant type with specific&#xD;
      phenotype outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint: We will quantify the frequency of a set phenotypic observations for&#xD;
      patients with variation in specified connective tissue genes. Organ systems under evaluation&#xD;
      are those predicted to be affected based on gene expression or previous medical record&#xD;
      investigations by our collaborators at Geisinger Health System.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoint: We will compare the frequency of specified phenotypes within genes in&#xD;
      patients with specific genotypes and across connective tissue genes. Different variation type&#xD;
      (stop gain vs missense) or location (in or out of a functional domain) has the potential to&#xD;
      cause different phenotypic outcomes. Likewise, variation in genes impacting the same pathways&#xD;
      may have overlapping phenotypes/outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect to enroll 120 evaluable subjects. We will allow for up to 30 additional&#xD;
      participants to account for screen failures and withdrawals, for an accrual ceiling of 150&#xD;
      participants (see section 6.1). The study will enroll children and adults with known variants&#xD;
      in the genes of interest (see Appendix A for list). No pregnant or lactating women may&#xD;
      enroll. Vulnerable populations, including children and cognitively impaired persons, may&#xD;
      participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Sites/Facilities Enrolling Participants: Patients with relevant genotypes will&#xD;
      be referred to the NIH for deep phenotyping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll for up to 60 months and will then require additional time for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) include an approximately one week&#xD;
      outpatient evaluation. No follow up visits are planned for this protocol. However, in the&#xD;
      unusual circumstance that testing could not be completed at the time of the participant s&#xD;
      visit (equipment failure or scheduling problem), the participant may return at a later date&#xD;
      to complete desired testing. We may re-contact the individual for follow up testing as part&#xD;
      of a different protocol in the future.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        In order to be eligible to participate in this study, an individual must meet all of the&#xD;
        following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participant must have a genetic variant in one of the connective tissue target genes&#xD;
             identified on previous research or clinical genetic testing. A clinical or research&#xD;
             report of the variant in question will be reviewed at the time of referral.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. This variant must be of sufficient interest for focused study to the clinical research&#xD;
             team. Interest may be based on a variety of factors including: its population&#xD;
             frequency, potential pathogenicity, or apparent genotype/phenotype associations in the&#xD;
             medical record, among others.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Male or female, within the ages of 2 and 100 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pregnancy or Nursing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Rational for excluding pregnant women&#xD;
&#xD;
        We do believe that pregnancy likely impacts connective tissue disease and deserves focused&#xD;
        study. Unfortunately, we do not believe that our current study design will allow us to&#xD;
        attract a large enough number of currently pregnant women to adequately power a direct&#xD;
        study into the impacts of connective tissue disease on pregnancy. And the single visit&#xD;
        nature of the study precludes following an individual throughout their pregnancy. As such,&#xD;
        we have chosen to exclude currently pregnant women from the study. We do, however, welcome&#xD;
        their participation once pregnancy is done. We expect that our history taking will include&#xD;
        questions about pregnancy and so may still collect historical data related to these&#xD;
        variants and pregnancy.&#xD;
