  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) is a well-known sequel of multiple abdominal malignancies&#xD;
      either arising from the gastro-intestinal tract or of gynaecologic origin. On occurrence, PC&#xD;
      is mostly considered as a very bad prognostic sign hence it affects the overall survival with&#xD;
      very poor response to systemic chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On introduction of the new concept of combined optimal cytoreduction (CRS) followed by&#xD;
      hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC), promising prognosis began to be shown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A major obstacle which may face application of HIPEC manoeuvre is the cost either of the&#xD;
      machine or the disposable kit used in handling the chemotherapy, heating it and delivering it&#xD;
      to the patient, hence we established our machine design with its disposable kits making it&#xD;
      available for use in poor places.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As aforementioned the use of HIPEC technique offered a promising results in dealing with&#xD;
      peritoneal carcinomatosis the high costs seems to be a considerable obstacle in some poor&#xD;
      places so we inented a machine with considerably lower costs both in the machine composition&#xD;
      and its disposable kit used for every patient we used it for six years in a trial to find any&#xD;
      shortage, obstacles or any technical, therapeutic or financial drawbacks compared to the&#xD;
      published data of the standard machines&#xD;
