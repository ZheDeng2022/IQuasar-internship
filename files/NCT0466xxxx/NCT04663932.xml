  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label clinical study has a target&#xD;
      enrollment of 240 subjects. It will explore whether STEMI patients transferred to a PCI&#xD;
      center following thrombolytic therapy and expected to have stent implantation might benefit&#xD;
      from an alternative treatment strategy and the use of new technologies designed to improve&#xD;
      myocardial protection throughout the medical care process.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients with STEMI who meet the Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria will receive&#xD;
      thrombolytic therapy, and then be transferred to the PCI center for coronary angiography&#xD;
      (CAG). Patients having a target vessel with TIMI grade 3 flow as shown by CAG, and and ≥ 50%&#xD;
      angiographic stenosis after thrombus aspiration, will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either&#xD;
      an immediate stenting group or a deferred stenting group. Patients assigned to the immediate&#xD;
      stenting group will undergo appropriate stent implantation based on characteristics of the&#xD;
      lesions. Patients assigned to the deferred stenting group will be sent back to the ward after&#xD;
      PCI to receive standard anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapies, and the CAG will be&#xD;
      repeated 5 to 7 days after initial intervention, followed by treatment with stent&#xD;
      implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be recorded postoperative microcirculation perfusion and ST-segment drop of&#xD;
      electrocardiogram and followed up by telephone or in the clinic at 1, 6, and 12 months after&#xD;
      discharge from the hospital to obtain information including their general condition, chief&#xD;
      complaints or discomforts, details of taking their oral medications, recent relevant test&#xD;
      results, and to evaluate the primary endpoint, secondary endpoints.&#xD;
