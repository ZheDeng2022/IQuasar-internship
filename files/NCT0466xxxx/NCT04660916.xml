  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The nail is an important skin appendage which can provide information about the person's&#xD;
      overall health status in addition to having several important functions such as protection,&#xD;
      tactile sensation, grasping. Many nail abnormalities which can have considerable&#xD;
      psychological impact are side effects of drug administration. Retinoids have various effects&#xD;
      on nails. Although isotretinoin as a retinoid has been associated with both decreased and&#xD;
      increased nail growth, the great majority of such associations are not evidence-based. So, it&#xD;
      was aimed to investigate the effects of isotretinoin on morphology, growth rate, and&#xD;
      thickness of the nail plate.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Isotretinoin has various side effects that affect many organ systems. Some side effects such&#xD;
      as nail changes, which do not require treatment cessation, can limit the use of isotretinoin&#xD;
      by impairing the patient's quality of life. Although it is known that isotretinoin has&#xD;
      various effects on the nails, there is very limited data on effects of isotretinoin on the&#xD;
      nails. Therefore, it was aimed to investigate the effect of isotretinoin on the morphology,&#xD;
      growth rate, and thickness of the nail plate. The patients aged 18-45 that were planned to&#xD;
      begin treatment with isotretinoin for acne in the outpatient clinic and a control group&#xD;
      consisting of healthy volunteers are planned to be included in the study. A dermatological&#xD;
      examination of skin and nails is conducted in all participants. Isotretinoin treatment at 0.5&#xD;
      mg/kg per day in 2 divided doses will be started to patients with acne. The length and&#xD;
      thickness of nail plate are measured by digital caliper before isotretinoin treatment, and&#xD;
      repeated during the control visits of the participants at 30 day intervals for 6 months. All&#xD;
      the examination and measurements are carried out in both groups.&#xD;
