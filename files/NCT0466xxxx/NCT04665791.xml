  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is part of a series of projects to improve protection against meningitis.&#xD;
      Previously, researchers have given nose drops containing N. lactamica to over 400 volunteers&#xD;
      and shown that many of them become colonised with N. lactamica without causing any illness or&#xD;
      disease. This has previously been shown to prevent people from becoming colonised with N.&#xD;
      meningitidis which can cause meningitis. This study aims to give nose drops containing N.&#xD;
      lactamica to healthy adults in Mali, to see if they become safely colonised. In the future&#xD;
      the study team would like to find out how N.lactamica helps children resist N.meningitidis,&#xD;
      and develop new vaccines that exploit that mechanism.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this pilot research, the study team will use a methodology of nasal inoculation with&#xD;
      reconstituted lyophilised N. lactamica (hereafter LyoNlac) developed in a previous, UK-based,&#xD;
      human challenge study. This methodology and will be developed further and validated in&#xD;
      healthy Malian adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A dose-ranging strategy will be used, starting with the dose identified as the standard&#xD;
      inoculum in healthy adults in the UK, which was the dose required to induce colonisation in&#xD;
      approximately 80% of volunteers. The dose will be escalated to a dose able to induce a&#xD;
      similar level of colonisation in Malian adults. This study will inform the study team whether&#xD;
      intranasal inoculation of reconstituted lyophilised Nlac (hereafter, lyoNlac), can result in&#xD;
      immunising colonisation of adult Malian volunteers and the optimal dose to achieve this. This&#xD;
      dose and methodology will then be used in future studies looking at the duration and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of colonisation induced by LyoNlac in Mali.&#xD;
