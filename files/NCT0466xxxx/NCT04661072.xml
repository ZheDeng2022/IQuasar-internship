  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to learn more about the health outcomes associated with&#xD;
      congenital uterine anomalies (CUAs), and the possible environmental and genetic causes of the&#xD;
      condition. The researchers plan to investigate whether any cancer associations (with breast,&#xD;
      renal, ovarian, vaginal and uterine cancers) exist in females with CUAs. The investigator&#xD;
      will also investigate any environmental and genetic factors that may be responsible for&#xD;
      causing CUAs.&#xD;

      Aim 1: To identify female subjects diagnosed with a Congenital Uterine Anomaly (CUA)&#xD;
      receiving care at Yale New Haven Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Identify (i) the prevalence of renal, breast, ovarian, uterine and vaginal cancers&#xD;
      associated with CUAs, and (ii) the association of environmental factors, via a survey&#xD;
      obtained by phone, email or interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Conduct genetic evaluation of the index subjects, parents, sister(s) (as feasible),&#xD;
      and female offspring to identify potential causes and patterns of inheritance using whole&#xD;
      exome sequencing (WES) and microarray.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following informed consent, blood will be collected for genetic evaluation. DNA will be&#xD;
      extracted from EDTA-blood and analyzed using an integrated approach of microarray for copy&#xD;
      number variations (CNV), and Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) for Single Nucleotide Variation&#xD;
      (SNV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Undertaking review of the medical records will identify the cohort of patients we wish to&#xD;
      survey to then ascertain further information regarding their CUA diagnosis and other related&#xD;
      details. The information to be elicited from the survey are outlined in the attached survey&#xD;
      questions. Key associations we seek to investigate include (1) the type and prevalence of&#xD;
      renal, breast, ovarian, uterine and vaginal cancers among patients with Mullerian Anomaly,&#xD;
      and (2) identifying potential in-utero exposure to particular environmental agents in&#xD;
      patients with CUAs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Review of the medical records will enable us to undertake this first key step of establishing&#xD;
      a cohort of subjects with MA and an initial data set related to their specific health&#xD;
      information. We anticipate further investigations may build upon this initial data set, both&#xD;
      with the cohort established, and more broadly with collaborators and additional national and&#xD;
      international cohorts of patients with MA.&#xD;
