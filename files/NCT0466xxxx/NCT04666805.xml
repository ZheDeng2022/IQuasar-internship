    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the relationship between the endocrine therapy and the survival&#xD;
      of patients with hormone receptor positive intraductal carcinoma of the breast, and the&#xD;
      optimal duration of medication. This study will also analyze the risk factors of recurrence&#xD;
      and metastasis of hormone receptor positive intraductal carcinoma of the breast and establish&#xD;
      a prognosis model to further clarify the specific reasons for recurrence and metastasis,&#xD;
      adverse reactions, and drug withdrawal in patients with hormone receptor positive intraductal&#xD;
      carcinoma of the breast after endocrine therapy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intraductal carcinoma of the breast accounts for 20% of newly diagnosed breast cancer. In&#xD;
      addition to necessary surgical treatment, 5-year endocrine therapy is also essential for&#xD;
      patients with hormone receptor positive ductal carcinoma of the breast. Commonly used drugs&#xD;
      include selective estrogen receptor modulators (Tamoxifen, Toremifene) and aromatase&#xD;
      inhibitors (Exemestane, Anastrozole, Letrozole). Although these drugs can effectively reduce&#xD;
      the recurrence and metastasis of ductal carcinoma of the breast, the adverse reactions of the&#xD;
      above drugs significantly reduce the quality of life and treatment compliance of the&#xD;
      patients. Therefore, the choice of endocrine therapy for intraductal carcinoma of the breast&#xD;
      has been widely discussed. Is it possible for de-escalation of endocrine treatment intensity&#xD;
      to reduce adverse reactions and improve patient compliance? Recently, a phase 3 clinical&#xD;
      trial found that compared with placebo group, the adverse reactions of Tamoxifen group&#xD;
      treated with 5 mg/d (conventional dose 20 mg/d) Tamoxifen for 3 years had less adverse&#xD;
      reactions and achieved significant efficacy. This study revealed the reliable efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of Tamoxifen, a low-dose drug for treatment of hormone receptor positive intraductal&#xD;
      carcinoma of the breast. However, little is reported on the reasonable duration of Aromatase&#xD;
      inhibitors for endocrine therapy in patients with intraductal carcinoma of the breast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will investigate the relationship between the endocrine therapy and the survival&#xD;
      of patients with hormone receptor positive intraductal carcinoma of the breast, and the&#xD;
      optimal duration of medication. This study will also analyze the risk factors of recurrence&#xD;
      and metastasis of hormone receptor positive intraductal carcinoma of the breast and establish&#xD;
      a prognosis model to further clarify the specific reasons for recurrence and metastasis,&#xD;
      adverse reactions, and drug withdrawal in patients with hormone receptor positive intraductal&#xD;
      carcinoma of the breast after endocrine therapy.&#xD;

    <description>Adjuvant therapy with letrozole for 5 years or until the disease relapses. Patients who have received tamoxifen adjuvant therapy for 5 years should continue to take Letrozole until the disease relapses. The recommended dose of Letrozole tablets is one 2.5 mg tablet administered once a day, without regard to meals. For patients with advanced breast cancer, treatment with Letrozole should continue until tumor progression is confirmed. Patients with liver and/or renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance rate ≥ 10 mL/min) do not need to adjust the dosage.</description>

    <description>The recommended dose of Exemestane for adult and older patients with early and advanced breast cancer is one 25 mg tablet administered orally once a day after a meal. After 2-3 years of tamoxifen treatment, patients with early breast cancer should continue to use Tamoxifen in the case of no recurrence or contralateral breast cancer, until the completion of 5-year sequential adjuvant therapy with tamoxifen and exemestane. Patients with advanced breast cancer should continue to take Exemestane until the tumor progresses.</description>
