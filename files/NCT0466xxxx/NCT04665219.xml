  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been recognized that oral health education for parents is critical for the prevention&#xD;
      of early childhood caries (ECC). Few parents practiced caries prevention procedures for their&#xD;
      children in daily life, though. Inspired by Health Belief Model (HBM) and using text&#xD;
      messaging as a vehicle, a novel intervention scheme will be developed in this study. The&#xD;
      objective of the present randomized clinical trial (RCT) is to investigate the effectiveness&#xD;
      of the HBM-based behavioral intervention using text message to reduce early childhood caries&#xD;
      of children at age 4 through promoting the parental oral health care behaviors (toothbrushing&#xD;
      and sugar intake control) for their young children compared to conventional oral health&#xD;
      education. This RCT will recruit child-parent dyads in 26-36 child help centers or&#xD;
      kindergartens with nursery classes located in Hong Kong. A total of 518-628 dyads will be&#xD;
      recruited and randomly allocated into the test or control group with a 1:1 ratio. For parents&#xD;
      in the test group, the intervention will consist of a set of HBM-based text messages sent&#xD;
      regularly in the following 48 weeks. A standard text message will be sent to the parents in&#xD;
      the control group. The primary outcome will be dental caries measured by dmft/dmfs of the&#xD;
      children at 4 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By HBM-based intervention via a low-cost text messaging vehicle, it should be able to help&#xD;
      the parents establish proper oral health behaviors for their children and safeguard the oral&#xD;
      health of children in Hong Kong.&#xD;
