      The study will evaluate the household-level impact of IPT for malaria in schoolchildren on&#xD;
      malaria transmission, using a randomized trial design. Two schools in Busia district will be&#xD;
      randomly selected and randomize to either IPT with dihydroartemisinin piperaquine (DP, IPT&#xD;
      arm), or standard of care (no intervention). A single dose/round of IPT with DP (40mg/320mg&#xD;
      tabs, Fosun Pharmaceuticals) will be given to the children in the intervention arm. The full&#xD;
      dose will be given as oral tablets once a day for 3 consecutive days to all eligible children&#xD;
      in the intervention school. Surveys will be conducted in households of 100 randomly selected&#xD;
      children in each of the study arms at baseline, one month and three months following the&#xD;
      intervention. The target population will include all household members of the selected&#xD;
      households.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The most promising strategy to address the burden of malaria in school-aged children is&#xD;
      intermittent preventive treatment with antimalarials (IPTsc). IPTsc has clearly been&#xD;
      demonstrated to improve the health and educational attainment of schoolchildren. While the&#xD;
      goal of IPTsc is improving the individual outcomes, reducing infections in schoolchildren, a&#xD;
      primary reservoir for human-to-mosquito transmission may reduce overall transmission&#xD;
      increasing the benefits and adding value to this intervention. In areas where the burden of&#xD;
      malaria remains high despite implementation of currently available tools, IPTsc could act as&#xD;
      a complimentary measure to reduce transmission incrementally while decreasing the burden of&#xD;
      malaria in a vulnerable, high yield population. However, the benefits of IPTsc specifically&#xD;
      targeting transmission reduction, have not widely been evaluated. We will evaluate impact of&#xD;
      IPTsc with an antimalarial in schoolchildren on the malaria burden in household members in a&#xD;
      high transmission area. The objective is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the impact of intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in&#xD;
           schoolchildren on malaria transmission at the household, as measured by the prevalence&#xD;
           of parasitaemia at the household level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the impact of intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in&#xD;
           schoolchildren on the health of the children as measured by the prevalence of&#xD;
           parasitaemia among the children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two primary schools will be randomly selected from the list of the schools in Busia district.&#xD;
      The list will act as the sampling frame for the school selection. Following the&#xD;
      identification of the two schools to participate in the study. The schools will be randomized&#xD;
      to either intervention or control arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single dose/round of IPT with DP (40mg/320mg tabs, Fosun Pharmaceuticals) will be given to&#xD;
      the children in the intervention arm. The full dose will be given as oral tablets once a day&#xD;
      for 3 consecutive days to all eligible children in the intervention school. The outcome is&#xD;
      the prevalence of parasitemia in the schoolchildren and household members. To assess the&#xD;
      impact of the intervention in schoolchildren, 216 children in the intervention school and 216&#xD;
      children in the control school will be randomly selected and assessed at baseline, 1 month&#xD;
      and 3 months following the intervention. The same children will be assessed at the 3 school&#xD;
      surveys. To assess the impact of the intervention on transmission at the household level, we&#xD;
      will enroll 476 household members in the intervention arm and 476 household members in the&#xD;
      control arm. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, 1 month and 3 months following the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
