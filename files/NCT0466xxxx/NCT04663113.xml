      The aim of this study is; To investigate the Effect of the Exercise Protocol Determined&#xD;
      According to Metabolic Rate in Early Burn Patients on Coagulation, Fibrinolytic Activity and&#xD;
      Functional Capacity, and to create an exercise protocol that can guide researchers working in&#xD;
      burn patients and physiotherapists working in burn centers at national and international&#xD;
      level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study, which is planned to be carried out in Hasan Kalyoncu University Faculty of Health&#xD;
      Sciences Department of Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation, will be included in the burn&#xD;
      patients in the 25 Aralık State Hospital Burn Center, service and intensive care unit.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Burn injury is one of the longest traumas, causing serious mortality and morbidity, and the&#xD;
      length of hospital stay and rehabilitation period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For optimal treatment after burns, all pathophysiological changes that may occur locally and&#xD;
      systemically after injury should be well known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Along with surgical and medical treatments, the role of early exercise in burn treatment is&#xD;
      becoming more and more important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Burn patients need a long rehabilitation period, including the acute period and the&#xD;
      post-discharge period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early exercise is very important, especially in burn intensive care units, for healing of&#xD;
      burns and minimizing the effects of hypermetabolism. Exercises should be started from the&#xD;
      first day the patient is hospitalized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a study on physiotherapists working in 6 major burn centers in the United States, stated&#xD;
      that all physiotherapists applied various exercises in the early period in burn patients, but&#xD;
      these exercises varied in all centers in terms of characteristics such as type and frequency.&#xD;
      In the same study, it was emphasized that exercise programs, which are the biggest help in&#xD;
      reducing intensive care periods in burn patients, should be more consistent and there is a&#xD;
      need for studies investigating the components of the exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stated in another study that the exercise program applied in the early period in burns does&#xD;
      not have an internationally accepted standard and studies should be done to create an&#xD;
      exercise prescription.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, it has been emphasized that exercise protocols differ between&#xD;
      physiotherapists and that there is no international standardization in questionnaire studies&#xD;
      on exercise protocols applied to burn patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, it has been emphasized that studies investigating exercise components will&#xD;
      contribute more to the burn literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is; To investigate the Effect of the Exercise Protocol Determined&#xD;
      According to Metabolic Rate in Early Burn Patients on Coagulation, Fibrinolytic Activity and&#xD;
      Functional Capacity, and to create an exercise protocol that can guide researchers working in&#xD;
      burn patients and physiotherapists working in burn centers at national and international&#xD;
      level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study, which is planned to be carried out in Hasan Kalyoncu University Faculty of Health&#xD;
      Sciences Department of Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation, will be included in the burn&#xD;
      patients in the 25 Aralık State Hospital Burn Center, service and intensive care unit.&#xD;

Ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) will be used as the aerobic exercise protocol and a 10-11 strength exercise will be given according to the RPE.&#xD;
If resistance exercise will be given, the intensity of the exercise (12-14) will be determined according to the RPE. Sandbags attached to the ankle will be used as a resistance exercise and 9 exercises were determined.
