  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chest pain is one of the most common reasons for emergency admission. Chest pain can be&#xD;
      caused by many cardiac and noncardiac causes. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) is one of the&#xD;
      most im-portant of these etiologies. ACS has a high mortality rate, but with early diagnosis&#xD;
      and related inter-ventions, a high rate of prognosis can be improved. Therefore, early&#xD;
      recognition of AKS is impor-tant. However, the challenge in emergency services is not only to&#xD;
      identify patients with high risk for ACS. Early detection of low-risk patients is also&#xD;
      important for emergency room management. These patients should be discharged quickly with&#xD;
      minimal examination and treatment. The follow-up of these patients with the acceptance of ACS&#xD;
      brings along unnecessary examinations and treatments. This leads to an increase in healthcare&#xD;
      costs and an increase in crowd in emergency services and hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of chest pain in the emergency room and early detection of life-threatening&#xD;
      conditions such as ACS present many difficulties for clinicians. For this reason, clinicians&#xD;
      use some scoring systems that determine the risk stratification of patients and the&#xD;
      probability of having acute coronary syndrome. Heart score is one of the scores developed for&#xD;
      this purpose. However vital signs are not included in calculating the heart score. Therefore,&#xD;
      the investigators considered to include the shock index calcula-ted by systolic blood&#xD;
      pressure and pulse in this scoring system. In addition, the investigators have included a&#xD;
      very valuable biochemical parameter such as lactate that predicts mortality in many diseases&#xD;
      in this scoring system. The investigators named this scoring system HEARTSIL. The&#xD;
      investigators aim to compare the diagnostic performance of this score with the diagnostic&#xD;
      performance of other scoring systems.&#xD;

      The study was planned to be conducted in Konya City Hospital Emergency Service. Adult&#xD;
      patients over 18 years of age who present to the emergency department with chest pain will be&#xD;
      included in the study. Patients who do not consent to participate in the study due to chest&#xD;
      pain such as ST elevation myocardial infarction, pneumonia, pneumothorax, pulmonary embolism&#xD;
      and esophageal rupture will be excluded from the study. Vital signs of the patients,&#xD;
      background information, the nature of the pain, the drugs used will be recorded. Blood tests&#xD;
      and electrocardiogram will be recorded. Heart Score, TIMI, GRACE score will be calculated.&#xD;
      Shock index and lactate value will also be included in the heart score. Shock index 0.5-0.7 =&#xD;
      0 points, 0.71-1 = 1 point and above 1 will be cal-culated as 2 points. Lactate levels 0-2&#xD;
      mEq/L =0 points, between 2,1-3,99 mEq/L= 1 point, above 4 mEq/L levels will be calculated 2&#xD;
      points. These points will be added to the Heart Score and will be named HEARTSIL. Patients&#xD;
      will be followed in terms of major cardiac events (MACE) for 3 days and 1 month. Prog-nostic&#xD;
      performance of HEARTSIL Score, Heart Score, GRACE, TIMI scores that the investigators&#xD;
      developed will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be uploaded to the database for statistics. First of all, whether the data is&#xD;
      normally distributed or not will be determined. Student-t for normally distributed data,&#xD;
      Mann-witney-u test for data that are not normally distributed, and chi-square will be used&#xD;
      for comparing categorical data. The ROC curve will be drawn and compared in determining the&#xD;
      prognostic performance of scoring systems for MACE development. In addition, PPD, NPD, +LR&#xD;
      and -LR sensitivity and spe-cificities will be calculated. Values with a p value below 0.05&#xD;
      will be considered statistically signifi-cant.&#xD;
