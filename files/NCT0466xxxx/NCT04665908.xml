  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to compare PT-led triage in secondary care setting for patients&#xD;
      with hip or/and knee osteoarthritis (OA) with standard care (i.e. assessment of orthopedic&#xD;
      surgeon). Comparison between cost-effectiveness, selection accuracy, patients perceived&#xD;
      quality of care, quality of life and physical function will be made.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common musculoskeletal disorder and the number of people in need of&#xD;
      surgical treatment for hip and knee OA is increasing. The waiting time for consultation with&#xD;
      an orthopedic surgeon (OS) is long and the majority of the patient referred for assessment&#xD;
      are not appropriate for surgical intervention. To reduce the number of patients seen by an OS&#xD;
      and thereby shorten the waiting time, Sahlgrenska University Hospital started a&#xD;
      Physiotherapist-led (PT-led) triage project in 2017. With PT-led triage the patients are&#xD;
      assessed by a physiotherapist to establish the most appropriate care management; if the&#xD;
      patient is appropriate for surgery, should be referred for continued rehabilitation, or&#xD;
      referred back to the referring physician. To our knowledge this model of care with PT-led&#xD;
      triage in secondary care setting have not been scientifically evaluated in Sweden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this project is to compare PT-led triage in a secondary care setting with standard&#xD;
      care (i.e. assessment of OS for patients with knee or /and hip OA). Patients referred from&#xD;
      primary care to Sahlgrenska University hospital with primary hip and/or knee OA will be&#xD;
      included and randomized to consultation with either PT (triage) or OS (standard practice).&#xD;
      Data about patient reported health-related quality of life, pain, function, and patients'&#xD;
      perception of quality of care will be collected using questionnaires at baseline, 3 and 12&#xD;
      months after the consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data about waiting time for consultation, proportion of patients appropriate for surgery,&#xD;
      further investigations, and data to be able to perform cost analysis will be collected from&#xD;
      patients´ journals, the patient administration systems, both locally and via the region&#xD;
      Västra Götaland´s database (VEGA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A qualitative approach will be used to further investigate patients experience of a&#xD;
      pt-ledtrige&#xD;
