      There are no studies in literature up to now, that analyze the changes in knee pain and&#xD;
      correlate this parameter with knee function and biomechanics, in regular casual sport player&#xD;
      subject affected by knee overuse syndrome and underwent an intra-articular HA injection. The&#xD;
      aim of this study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of Hymovis® ONE (32 mg/4 ml) single&#xD;
      intra-articular injection, in the management of pain caused by knee osteochondral lesions.&#xD;

    <description>To demonstrate that a single intra-articular (i.a.) injection of Hymovis® ONE (32 mg/4 ml) decreases the difficulties in sport and recreational activity. The efficacy will be measured evaluating the improved knee function during sport and recreational activity through the fourth item (SP1-SP5) of the KOOS questionnaire, 90 days after injection.
