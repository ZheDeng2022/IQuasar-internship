      The aims of this observational survey are to i) gather experience on how to conduct a&#xD;
      prevalence study of mental disorders in the Norwegian setting, ii) collect data on the&#xD;
      prevalence, risk factors and consequences of mental and substance use disorders, iii) collect&#xD;
      data on treatment coverage for mental and substance use disorders, iv) conduct a thorough&#xD;
      nonparticipation analysis.&#xD;

      The psychiatric survey was a sub-project in the fourth wave of the Trøndelag Health Study&#xD;
      (HUNT4), conducted on HUNT4 participants aged 20 to 65 years from the geographical areas&#xD;
      Nord-Trøndelag and the city of Trondheim. The targeted sample size was 4,000 participants,&#xD;
      and 16,602 persons from the study population of HUNT4 participants were invited to reach this&#xD;
      goal. The only exclusion criterion was insufficient understanding of Norwegian or English.&#xD;
      The investigators had complete lists with postal addresses and mobile phone numbers for all&#xD;
      eligible participants as well as information about date of birth and gender. Potential&#xD;
      participants were sampled in repeated probability sampling draws over the course of the&#xD;
      data-collection period, which lasted from November 2nd 2018 to September 18th 2020. Younger&#xD;
      persons were oversampled to adjust for the expected larger nonparticipation among these&#xD;
      age-groups. The predesignated participants were informed about the project through postal&#xD;
      letters. A week after receipt of the letter, each received an SMS with information on how to&#xD;
      sign up for the psychiatric interview. One SMS reminder was sent to persons who did not&#xD;
      respond to the initial invitation. The investigators made four contact attempts to schedule&#xD;
      the interview amongst those who registered; three by phone and one final by SMS. All&#xD;
      participants received a $30 gift card as a token of appreciation. Computer assisted&#xD;
      face-to-face or telephone interviews were conducted by trained and certified interviewers at&#xD;
      local field stations. The World Health Organization (WHO) Composite International Diagnostic&#xD;
      Interview, fifth version (CIDI 5.0) was used as instrument in the data-collection.&#xD;
