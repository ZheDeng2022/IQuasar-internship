    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate and compare the long term effects of traditional&#xD;
      and modified static cross-body posterior shoulder stretching training in individuals with&#xD;
      subacromial impingement syndrome (SIS) having glenohumeral internal rotation deficit (GIRD).&#xD;
      Modified cross body posterior shoulder stretching group will receive static stretching in the&#xD;
      modified cross-body stretching position and standard physiotherapy program. The traditional&#xD;
      cross body posterior shoulder stretching group will receive static stretching and standard&#xD;
      physiotherapy program. The Control group will receive only sham stretching and standard&#xD;
      physiotherapy program.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SIS is the most common cause of pain and shoulder dysfunction. The etiology of SIS depends on&#xD;
      many factors including tightness of the posterior shoulder structures. Posterior shoulder&#xD;
      tightness (PST) narrows the subacromial space and forces anterior-superior migration of the&#xD;
      humeral head over the glenoid fossa and, it could cause limitation of the internal rotation&#xD;
      (IR) and horizontal adduction range of motion (ROM). GIRD is known as loss of IR ROM in the&#xD;
      glenohumeral joint. In the SIS, limitation IR ROM has been reported. Supraspinatus tendon&#xD;
      thickness can change, subacromial space may become narrower and joint position sense (JPS)&#xD;
      could be decreased in SIS patients. The effectiveness of traditional static cross body&#xD;
      posterior shoulder stretching on various parameters such as shoulder rotational ROM or pain&#xD;
      was studied and proved in the literature. Traditional static cross body posterior shoulder&#xD;
      stretching could reduce subacromial symptoms and improve shoulder ROM with some disadvantages&#xD;
      such as inadequate control of the scapula and glenohumeral rotation. To prevent accessory&#xD;
      abduction of the scapula, restrict the external rotation ROM of the humerus and provide&#xD;
      isolated posterior capsule stretching, Wilk et al. (2013) recommend the use of modified&#xD;
      cross-body stretching for IR ROM increase. In the modified cross-body position, the patient&#xD;
      is positioned in a more advantageous way. In the literature, although modified cross-body&#xD;
      posterior stretching seems effective on SIS symptoms there is no research about the&#xD;
      comparison of the long-term effects of the traditional and modified static cross-body&#xD;
      posterior shoulder stretching exercises in individuals with SIS having GIRD. Therefore,&#xD;
      whether modified stretching is superior to traditional stretching is not known. Our study&#xD;
      aims to investigate and compare the long term effects of the traditional static cross-body&#xD;
      posterior shoulder stretching exercise and modified static cross-body posterior shoulder&#xD;
      stretching exercise in individuals with SIS having GIRD on shoulder IR ROM, GIRD, PST, pain,&#xD;
      external rotation ROM, JPS, subacromial space, supraspinatus tendon thickness, posterior&#xD;
      capsule thickness, the occupational ratio of the supraspinatus tendon in the subacromial&#xD;
      space, muscle strength and shoulder function and disability level. Stretching groups will&#xD;
      receive either traditional or modified static cross-body posterior shoulder stretching&#xD;
      exercise and standard physiotherapy program. The Control group will receive only sham&#xD;
      stretching and standard physiotherapy program. Standard physiotherapy program consists of&#xD;
      electrotherapy, posture, proprioceptive, and strengthening exercises. The treatment program&#xD;
      will be performed 5 days a week under the physiotherapist's supervision and 2 days a week as&#xD;
      a home program for 8 weeks.&#xD;

    <description>For the modified cross-body position patient will be positioned in the side-lying position to limit the scapular abduction, and the patient aligned his/her forearms to limit the ER of the humerus while moving into horizontal adduction (HAdd). First, we will ask the patient to pull his/her arm into HAdd to the physiological barrier of the ROM, and then the patient will perform active-assistive static stretching with the help of the other hand for 30 seconds. The stretching will perform five repetitions with 10-sec rest between stretches. Each stretching will begin from a new physiological barrier of the HAdd ROM. Patients will also receive the standard physiotherapy program consists of physical agents, posture, proprioceptive, and strengthening exercises. The treatment program will be performed 5 days a week under the physiotherapist's supervision and 2 days a week as a home program for 8 weeks.</description>

    <description>For the traditional static cross-body posterior shoulder stretching, in the standing position, the patient will perform cross-body stretch alone by active-assistive pulling the humerus across the body into HAdd with the opposite arm, without concern for scapular stabilization for 30 sec. The stretching will perform five repetitions with 10-sec rest between stretches. Each stretching will begin from a new physiological barrier of the HAdd ROM. Patients will also receive the standard physiotherapy program consists of physical agents, posture, proprioceptive, and strengthening exercises.

    <description>In sham stretching, the patient will be positioned in the traditional static cross body posterior shoulder stretching position, and then the patient will perform active-assistive HAdd ROM without enough stretching of the relevant tissue. Active assistive ROM will be stopped before reaching the individual PST measurement result (in this way, sham stretching will be performed without proper stretching of the relevant tissue). The HAdd ROM exercise will be performed 5 times. Patients will also receive the standard physiotherapy program consists of physical agents, posture, proprioceptive, and strengthening exercises. The treatment program will be performed 5 days a week under the physiotherapist's supervision and 2 days a week as a home program for 8 weeks.</description>
