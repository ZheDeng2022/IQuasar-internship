  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to evaluate the components of the app-based intervention Mission&#xD;
      Wellness to reduce health-risking sexual behaviors (HRSBs; e.g., condom non-use, multiple&#xD;
      sexual partners) in active-duty members of the US Military to improve their sexual and&#xD;
      reproductive health (SRH) and readiness to serve. Following the multiphase optimization&#xD;
      strategy (MOST) framework, factorial component selection experiments (CSEs) will be conducted&#xD;
      to evaluate which five experimental intervention components (i.e., Narratives, Skills,&#xD;
      Scenarios, Future, and Risk) elicit the greatest improvements in the outcomes of interest&#xD;
      given key constraints.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Negative SRH outcomes (e.g., sexually transmitted infections [STIs], unintended pregnancy,&#xD;
      STI-related cancers) reduce human performance and undermine military readiness. Service&#xD;
      members face unique challenges to maintaining SRH during their military service. HRSBs (e.g.,&#xD;
      multiple sexual partners, unprotected sexual behavior) offer potential intervention targets&#xD;
      to improve SRH. Electronic-health interventions are cost-effective and dynamic, and have the&#xD;
      potential to reach millions of users as part of an overall strategy for individual behavior&#xD;
      and systems change. In civilian populations, e-health interventions have demonstrated success&#xD;
      in reducing HRSBs. However, effective HRSB-prevention interventions must consider the&#xD;
      specific values, mission, and context of military populations and settings. The MOST&#xD;
      framework is used to develop highly effective, efficient, and economic behavioral&#xD;
      interventions that is particularly well suited to be used in this context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project aims to address this problem by delivering an optimized app-based prevention&#xD;
      intervention package ready for evaluation via a subsequent randomized controlled trial (RCT).&#xD;
      The specific purpose of this project is to determine which component(s) should be included in&#xD;
      the packaged app-based intervention Mission Wellness for US service members based on their&#xD;
      effects on the outcomes of interest (i.e., improved knowledge, motivation, and behavior&#xD;
      skills related to SRH and reduced HRSBs) in no more than 25 minutes of content. The&#xD;
      components tested in the factorial CSEs include: Narratives; Skills; Scenarios; Future; and&#xD;
      Risk. Each component has two levels: &quot;on&quot; (included) or &quot;off&quot; (not included). Main and&#xD;
      interaction effects of components will be measured to determine the components constituting&#xD;
      the packaged intervention.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The MOST framework will be used. This study follows the optimization phase of the MOST framework where component selection experiments are conducted to experimentally evaluate the effectiveness of individual intervention components. Using a factorial design in this phase allows the effect of each intervention component to be evaluated and for observation of interaction effects while maximizing statistical power using a smaller sample size compared to an randomized controlled trial (RCT) powered similarly to explore individual components of an intervention. The optimization phase then allows for time and resources to be saved by ensuring only optimized components are retained after the RCT in the final intervention package.</intervention_model_description>
