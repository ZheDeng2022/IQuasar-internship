  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Digital health technologies (DHT) are increasingly developed to support healthcare systems&#xD;
      around the world. However, they are frequently lacking evidence-based medicine and medical&#xD;
      validation. There is considerable need in the western countries to allocate healthcare&#xD;
      resources accurately and give the population detailed and reliable health information&#xD;
      enabling to take greater responsibility for their health. Intelligent patient flow management&#xD;
      system (IPFM, product name Klinik Frontline) is developed to meet these needs. In practice,&#xD;
      IPFM is used for decision support in the triaging and diagnostic processes as well as&#xD;
      automatizing the management of inflow of the patients. The core of the IPFM is a clinical&#xD;
      artificial intelligence (AI), which utilizes a comprehensive medical database of clinical&#xD;
      correlations generated by medical doctors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population of this research consists of patients from the Paediatric Emergency&#xD;
      Clinic of Turku University Hospital (TUH). Data will be gathered during 6 months of piloting,&#xD;
      after which the results will be analysed. Anticipated number of patients to the study is&#xD;
      minimum of 500 patients, with objective to be 1 000. When attending to the hospital, patients&#xD;
      or their guardians will report their demographics, background information and symptoms using&#xD;
      structured IPFM online form. Results obtained from IPFM are blinded from the healthcare&#xD;
      professional and IPFM does not affect professional's clinical decision making. The data&#xD;
      obtained from IPFM online form and clinical data from the emergency department and TUH will&#xD;
      be analysed after the data collection. The main aim of the research is to validate the use of&#xD;
      IPFM by evaluating the association of IPFM output with 1) urgency and severity of the&#xD;
      conditions; and 2) actual diagnoses diagnosed by medical doctors. The main hypotheses of the&#xD;
      research are that 1) IPFM is safe and sensitive in evaluating the urgency of the conditions&#xD;
      of arriving patients at the emergency department and that 2) IPFM has sufficient correlation&#xD;
      of differential diagnosis with actual diagnosis made by medical doctor.&#xD;
