  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this pilot randomized-controlled trial (RCT) is to pilot a customized&#xD;
      smartphone app-based (Android and iOS) intervention with 50 adolescents living with HIV to&#xD;
      assess its feasibility and acceptability and to explore preliminary effects on treatment&#xD;
      adherence and social support.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Interventions that engage adolescents living with HIV to improve adherence to antiretroviral&#xD;
      therapy (ART) are urgently needed. Adolescents repeatedly demonstrate suboptimal adherence to&#xD;
      ART, which is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Developing&#xD;
      adherence-promoting interventions for adolescents requires an understanding of factors that&#xD;
      shape adherence from multiple levels. Developmental theories suggest that adolescents are&#xD;
      particularly sensitive to their social networks. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions, those&#xD;
      that use mobile technology (e.g., smartphones apps) to transmit health information, hold&#xD;
      promise as an effective way to improve ART adherence. These smartphone apps can be used to&#xD;
      engage social networks and provide social support. Access to mobile phone technology is&#xD;
      rapidly increasing among youth in South Africa, making mHealth interventions feasible and&#xD;
      potentially scalable in this setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will customize HealthMpowerment, a smartphone app-based (Android and iOS)&#xD;
      intervention originally developed by Dr. Lisa Hightow-Weidman, to improve ART adherence among&#xD;
      South African adolescents living with HIV. HealthMpowerment was developed based on the&#xD;
      Institute of Medicine's Integrated Behavior Model with extensive input from youth. The app is&#xD;
      designed to foster social support, offer tools for self-monitoring and habit formation,&#xD;
      provide resources for goal setting and action planning, and present users with engaging&#xD;
      informational resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot randomized-controlled trial (RCT) is funded through a K01 Mentored Research&#xD;
      Scientist Development Award. Prior to the pilot RCT, the study team will iteratively&#xD;
      customize the HealthMpowerment app through in-depth interviews and focus group discussions&#xD;
      with adolescents living with HIV in Cape Town. For the pilot RCT, participants will be&#xD;
      randomized to either the intervention or control (standard of care) condition (1:1).&#xD;
      Participants randomized to the intervention will be asked to engage with the app for 6&#xD;
      months. All participants will complete baseline and follow-up assessments at 3- and 6-months.&#xD;
