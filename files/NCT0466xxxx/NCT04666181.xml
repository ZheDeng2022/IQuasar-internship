    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to assess the effects of dual-task training using a&#xD;
      dynamic balance task and an auditory reaction time task on dual-task performance in healthy&#xD;
      young adults and to assess the cortical activity within the prefrontal and sensorimotor&#xD;
      cortices in response to dual-task training using functional near infrared spectroscopy&#xD;
      (fNIRS).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the influence of a dual-task (combined motor-cognitive&#xD;
      task) on dual-task performance of a complex dynamic stability task in healthy young adults&#xD;
      and to assess the effects of dual-task training on cognitive-motor learning and cortical&#xD;
      activation in healthy young adults. A dual-task is defined as concurrent performance of two&#xD;
      tasks, usually a cognitive and motor task, that can be performed independently and have&#xD;
      distinct and separate goals. Individuals engage in dual tasks every day and must allocate&#xD;
      attentional resources to each task. While recognition of susceptibility to performance&#xD;
      decrements in dual-task settings may be difficult, increased dual-task complexity is&#xD;
      associated with decreased performance in one or both tasks. The well documented effects of&#xD;
      dual-task practice represent a promising approach to improve dual-task performance for&#xD;
      clinical populations such as individuals with neurological conditions or older individuals,&#xD;
      in which complex multitask situations can increase fall risk due to hindered balance and&#xD;
      walking performance. Similarly, young adults have demonstrated performance decrements while&#xD;
      executing a dual-task that involved a combined balance and cognitive task. Research of&#xD;
      dual-task training in healthy young cohort has indicated significant improvements in both&#xD;
      motor and cognitive task performance in dual-task situations, suggesting the efficiency of&#xD;
      this intervention strategy. However, most of these studies have investigated effects of a&#xD;
      simple postural task combined with cognitive task training on dual-task performance. Effects&#xD;
      of dual-task training using a complex dynamic postural stability task on dual-task&#xD;
      performance of such complex task is lacking. Moreover, existing studies demonstrate&#xD;
      conflicting evidence of dual-task training effects among healthy young adults since&#xD;
      improvements in the motor task only have been largely reported. It is crucial to understand&#xD;
      dual-task training effects on performance of a complex cognitive-motor task since postural&#xD;
      control involves complex integration of somatosensory, vestibular, and visual systems. Our&#xD;
      experimental paradigm will challenge these systems; thus, findings of this study would inform&#xD;
      our intervention strategies in a variety of populations ranging from athletes to individuals&#xD;
      with neurological conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dynamic postural stability is an integral aspect of postural control and it involves complex&#xD;
      interaction of prefrontal, somatosensory, vestibular, and visual systems. However, a motor&#xD;
      task involving complex interaction of these systems combined with cognitive task challenges&#xD;
      has not been investigated thoroughly. Moreover, neural activation within these cortical areas&#xD;
      during dual-task performance and effects of dual-task training are largely unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since, coordinated control of the body requires integration of all these systems (i.e.&#xD;
      prefrontal, somatosensory, vestibular, and visual), it is important to systemically study the&#xD;
      interference of an additional attention-demanding task, such as an auditory stimulus reaction&#xD;
      time task on interaction of these systems that may contribute to decreased postural&#xD;
      stability. Moreover, it is important to investigate if training on such a complex dual-task&#xD;
      can reduce motor-cognitive interference, improve postural stability, and optimize cortical&#xD;
      activation in complex dual-task conditions.&#xD;
