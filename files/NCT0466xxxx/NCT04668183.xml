  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypospadias repair is a urological surgical operation that is very painful in the&#xD;
      postoperative period and requires long-term analgesia. A dorsal penial nerve block (DPNB) and&#xD;
      pudendal nerve block (PNB), which are regional anesthesia techniques for this operation, are&#xD;
      used to provide postoperative analgesia.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The regional anesthesia techniques used for postoperative analgesia in hypospadias repair&#xD;
      include the peripheral nerve blocks of pudendal nerve block (PNB) and dorsal penile nerve&#xD;
      block (DPNB). Ultrasound (US) has recently become increasingly popular in regional anesthesia&#xD;
      practice and is used to aid these two peripheral nerve block applications in various&#xD;
      pediatric urological procedures. US-guided DPNB has been shown to provide effective and&#xD;
      long-term analgesia when compared to caudal epidural block in a recent study on hypospadias&#xD;
      surgery in the pediatric population.&#xD;

    <description>It was assessed six times after the operation with Children's Hospital Eastern Ontario Pain Scale. The lowest scale score is 4 points and the highest 13 points. Significant pain behavior for Children's Hospital Eastern Ontario Pain Scale has been identified as 7 points or more. Following transfer from the recovery unit to the ward, the 1st, 2nd, 6th, 12th and 24th hour pain levels were evaluated by the ward nurse. Paracetamol was administered IV at a dose of 10 mg/kg if the scale score was 7 or higher.</description>
