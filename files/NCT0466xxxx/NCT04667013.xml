  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (i.e.&#xD;
      how study drug is taken up by the body) of TBN in healthy participants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial is a single center, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multiple-dose study in 2&#xD;
      ascending dose cohorts of healthy subjects. The primary purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      investigate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic property of the multiple doses of&#xD;
      TBN administered for 6.5 consecutive days in healthy participants.&#xD;
