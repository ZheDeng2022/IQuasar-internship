  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients suspected with infection is one of the major groups, who are admitted to the Danish&#xD;
      Emergency Departments (ED). Currently, there is no overall description of the distribution of&#xD;
      these infections. The aim of this study is to characterize ED patients with a suspected&#xD;
      infection whereby the focus of the infection is of an unknown origin.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bacteria resistant to antibiotics are associated with high antibiotic consumption and are&#xD;
      identified by the World Health Organisation as a major public health threat. Despite efforts&#xD;
      to optimize antibiotic consumption in Denmark, the total consumption in the hospital sector&#xD;
      increased from 2009-2018 and the incidence of multi-resistance bacteria (MRB) is increasing.&#xD;
      A Danish multicenter study has shown that every 20th patient in the emergency department has&#xD;
      MRB. Patients with an infection of unknown origin tend to be prescribed a broad-spectrum&#xD;
      antibiotic, as physicians endeavour to target probable origins in the body. The uncertainty&#xD;
      associated with the diagnosis may lead to an overconsumption of antibiotics, which&#xD;
      contributes to increased development of resistant bacteria and threatens future treatment&#xD;
      options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to characterize patients admitted to the ED suspected with&#xD;
      infection. The study will have three objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the distribution of ED infections according to the registered diagnosis in&#xD;
           the medical record compared to a clinical expert panel assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify clinically relevant information available at admission associated with a&#xD;
           patients infection of unknown origin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the association between an adverse event and clinically relevant&#xD;
           information for patients with infection of unknown origin&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' hypothesis is that with an improvement of knowledge about patients with an&#xD;
      infection of unknown origin, a more accurate diagnosis can be made leading to a more&#xD;
      appropriate antibiotic therapy and contributing to the fight against resistance to&#xD;
      antibiotics.&#xD;
