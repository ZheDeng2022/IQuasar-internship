      The potential of the administration of indocyanine green (ICG) allows the execution of SLN&#xD;
      biopsy, avoiding the multiple administrations of radiocolloid in the pre-operative phase,&#xD;
      painful for the patient, elimination, and exposure to radioactivity. Therefore, while&#xD;
      requiring standardization of the methodology and a large-scale application, this procedure&#xD;
      could open a new surgical management perspective in patients with early-stage vulvar cancer.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      According to The European Society of Gynaecological Oncology (ESGO) guidelines, the&#xD;
      investigators decided to treat patients with vulvar squamous cell carcinoma (vSCC), FIGO&#xD;
      stage IB with radical vulvectomy, sentinel lymph node search, and removal with indocyanine&#xD;
      green (ICG) subsequent bilateral inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative imaging system The SPY Portable Handheld Imager (SPY-PHI) Â© Stryker was used&#xD;
      as the intraoperative imaging device. This device uses SPY fluorescence imaging technology to&#xD;
      visually assess blood circulation in blood vessels and associated tissue perfusion during&#xD;
      surgery. The design of SPY-PHI makes the device versatile, enabling the operator to frame the&#xD;
      operating field and use the acquired images in real-time, integrating fluorescence signal&#xD;
      data with white light images in real-time. The SPY Portable Handheld Imaging System Camera,&#xD;
      with integrated optics and cables for real-time fluorescence imaging in visible light and&#xD;
      near-infrared, is ideal for open surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative detection of the sentinel lymph node The fluorescent agent was administered to&#xD;
      patients placed in the lithotomy position under general anesthesia. Indocyanine green (ICG)&#xD;
      prepared with a 25 mg vial of green indocyanine green (ICG) (Pulsion Medical Systems AG,&#xD;
      Munich, Germany) diluted in 50 mL of water for injections (B. Braun Medical) was used,&#xD;
      resulting in a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL. Injection of 1 ml per quadrant was administered in&#xD;
      the three quadrants around the vulvar lesion. After the injection, the infrared camera,&#xD;
      equipped with a movable arm, was placed in front of the patient to detect transcutaneous&#xD;
      fluorescence during surgery. Subsequently, the SLN was localized based on the fluorescence&#xD;
      intensity. The intraoperative fluorescence detection camera system was used to open,&#xD;
      identify, and remove the SLN and the vulvectomy of the groin. After the excision, the capture&#xD;
      of the residual lymphatic pathway could be seen bilaterally through the infrared camera.&#xD;
      Additionally, all SLNs were subject to ex vivo imaging due to the presence of fluorescence.&#xD;
      The excised SLNs were sent to pathological anatomy and processed according to the standard&#xD;
      SLN protocol.&#xD;

    <description>Patients diagnosed with vulvar squamous cell carcinoma (FIGO IB stage) underwent bilateral radical vulvectomy, SLN search and removal, and bilateral inguinal lymphadenectomy at the Cannizzaro Hospital Operative Unit of Obstetrics and Gynecology Department (Catania, Italy). 3 ml of indocyanine green (ICG) 0.5 mg/mL was administered in 3 peritumoral injections under general anesthesia to screen the SLN. The images were acquired using an intraoperative infrared camera system, which allowed intraoperative visualization of the SLN. An SLN was identified for each patient. The lymph nodes examined by the pathologist were negative for metastatic localization of the disease. However, patients underwent bilateral inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy, as this procedure is not currently codified as a gold standard for the detection of SLN in vulvar cancer.</description>
