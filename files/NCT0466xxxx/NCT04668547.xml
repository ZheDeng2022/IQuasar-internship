      The investigators intend to assess if hysteroscopic evacuation of gestational tissue, is&#xD;
      possible as a tool for early induced abortion with a hysteroscopic morcellator rather than&#xD;
      with a traditional dilation and curettage procedure. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      induced abortion under vision with hysteroscopic guidance may provide benefits over the&#xD;
      traditional &quot;blind&quot; procedure&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Embryoscopy and fetoscopy had been used increasingly in the treatment of missed abortions in&#xD;
      the last two decades. This is done simply by transcervical hysteroscopy during pregnancy. The&#xD;
      fact that we can directly view the embryo in the gestational sac allows us to document and&#xD;
      describe the fetal morphology and to note different anatomical malformations. Phillips et al&#xD;
      described in 2001 the use of embryoscpy prior to evacuation of the uterus in early missed&#xD;
      abortions in order to diagnose anatomical malformations and to allow sampling of the fetal&#xD;
      tissues for genetic testing. The use of fetal tissue obtained in embryoscopy allows for a&#xD;
      more accurate genetic testing and diagnosis and reduces the amount of maternal cells in the&#xD;
      specimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hysteroscopic morcellation had been used for intrauterine tissue extraction for over 20&#xD;
      years. Hysteroscopic morcellators have been shown to provide rapid and complete resection of&#xD;
      polyps, fibroids, uterine septa and retained products of conception. These instruments use a&#xD;
      rotating blade and a suction system that allows for removal for the specimen under direct&#xD;
      hysteroscopic visualization. When compared with standard resectoscopic technique, the use of&#xD;
      hysteroscopic morcellators probably saves time and allows for more complete removal of the&#xD;
      specimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A feasibility study conducted in our institute showed that the use of the hysteroscopic&#xD;
      morcellator for resection of the fetal tissue in early missed abortions is feasible and safe&#xD;
      and might prove beneficial over the standard blind Dilatation and curettage currently used to&#xD;
      treat this condition. This technique might allow selective targeting of the fetal tissue thus&#xD;
      decreasing the damage caused by trauma to the entire uterine cavity. In a recent systematic&#xD;
      review the rate of intrauterine adhesions following D&amp;C for missed abortions ranged between&#xD;
      16 to 21 percent. This technique was assessed prior to our study in only one case published&#xD;
      in the literature and was found to be feasible, although the authors state that visibility&#xD;
      was poor while resecting the implantation site due to high vascularization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After demonstrating that hysteroscopic morcellation is possible in cases of early missed&#xD;
      abortions, we suggest that the procedure will be possible and safe in cases of early induced&#xD;
      abortions, with similar potential benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this pilot feasibility study, we hypothesize that the Truclear Elite tissue removal system&#xD;
      will be able to achieve full evacuation of the uterine cavity. Performed under direct&#xD;
      visualization and focused only on the implantation site, thus reducing the potential for&#xD;
      further intrauterine adhesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a prospective trial. All patients reffered for induced abortion by dilatation&#xD;
      and curettage with a gestational age of under 9 weeks in Assuta Ashdod University Hospital&#xD;
      that fit the inclusion criteria will be offered to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two hours prior to the procedure, patients without contraindications can receive cervical&#xD;
      preparation with misoprostol 400mcg sublingual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In theatre under general anesthesia The cervix can be dilated up to an 8 Hegar. Embryoscopy&#xD;
      with the TRUCLEAR Elite hysteroscopic morcellation system will be performed and findings will&#xD;
      be recorded on a video and in the data collection sheet. The location of the pregnancy, size&#xD;
      and specific embryonic findings will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following embryoscopy the system will be activated, and the products of conception will be&#xD;
      aspirated. If significant bleeding will obscure the hysteroscopic image, vasopressin can be&#xD;
      used. 20 units of vasopressin will be diluted in 100ml of saline and injected into the cervix&#xD;
      at four and eight o'clock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure will be performed under abdominal ultrasound guidance to minimize the&#xD;
      possibility of perforation. If visibility will be too poor, the procedure will be abandoned&#xD;
      and routine suction curettage will be performed using the abdominal ultrasound for guidance&#xD;
      All patients will receive prophylactic antibiotics with doxycycline and a follow up&#xD;
      appointment with an us examination will be scheduled 2-4 weeks following the procedure and a&#xD;
      routine diagnostic hysteroscopy will also be offered 4-6 weeks following the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited from the population of patients referred for dilatation and&#xD;
      curettage at Assuta Ashdod University Hospital for induced abortion. The researcher will&#xD;
      inform the patient about the study. The purpose of the study and possible complications,&#xD;
      advantages and alternatives. Patients will not be cajoled into participating in this study.&#xD;
      The Investigator will discuss foreseeable risks involved, as well as potential benefits.&#xD;
      Patients who have consented to having their information obtained during the study for&#xD;
      analysis of the results will have their confidentiality maintained at all times using a study&#xD;
      code as an identifier. The patients will be informed by the Investigator that it is their&#xD;
      choice to participate and if they do not participate their medical treatment will not be&#xD;
      jeopardized. If the patient chooses to participate, they may withdraw from the study at any&#xD;
      time without compromising further medical care. A signed and dated Informed Consent must be&#xD;
      obtained by the Investigator from the patient prior to enrolment into this study. The&#xD;
      original signed and dated information sheet and patient consent will be kept by the&#xD;
      Investigator. A signed copy will be provided to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since this is a pilot study designed to test the feasibility of the procedure the sample size&#xD;
      will include 10 women. This will allow accurate assessment of the procedure and possible&#xD;
      issues that might be related to the procedure.&#xD;
