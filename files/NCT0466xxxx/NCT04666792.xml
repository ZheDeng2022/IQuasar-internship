  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This a prospective, open-label implementation project to catalyze integration of HIV&#xD;
      prevention and PrEP care services for adolescent girls and young women in family planning&#xD;
      clinics in Kenya.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will conduct a stepped-wedge cluster-randomized programmatic project to&#xD;
      integrate PrEP provision within a combination HIV prevention package in 12 family planning&#xD;
      clinics in Kisumu, Kenya- a region with an HIV prevalence of up to 28% among young women. The&#xD;
      project will optimize and sustain PrEP delivery with existing family planning staff,&#xD;
      supported through training and ongoing technical assistance. The investigators will&#xD;
      rigorously evaluate program reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, maintenance, and&#xD;
      impact using validated implementation science frameworks and how clinics build new efficient&#xD;
      delivery systems.&#xD;

    <description>A fixed-dose, oral co-formulation of emtricitabine (FTC)/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is the approved and preferred regimen for HIV-1 prevention in Kenya and the United States. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends TDF-containing medications as PrEP, which includes TDF combined with FTC as well as potentially TDF alone and TDF combined with lamivudine (or 3TC, a medication closely related to FTC). Any TDF-containing medications that align with WHO and Kenya national guidelines for PrEP will be used. PrEP medication will come from clinic stocks.</description>
