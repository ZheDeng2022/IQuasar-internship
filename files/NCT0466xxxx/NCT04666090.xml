  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      China with high incidence of esophageal cancer, the number of new cases and deaths account&#xD;
      for about 50% of the world every year. In the past few decades, surgery, radiotherapy,&#xD;
      chemotherapy and other treatments were continuously improved, however, the mortality of&#xD;
      esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients was not significantly decreased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer, direct surgery is not effective. It is&#xD;
      difficult to achieve radical resection by surgery merely, and even if many patients receive&#xD;
      surgery, they may eventually have tumor recurrence and poor survival rate. Therefore, it is&#xD;
      necessary to explore effective perioperative neoadjuvant treatment to reduce the risk of&#xD;
      postoperative recurrence and improve the postoperative survival rate of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the reports, the expression of PD-L1 in esophageal cancer was about 41.4%.&#xD;
      Therefore, PD-1/ PD-L1 immunocheckpoint inhibitor may become a new method for the treatment&#xD;
      of esophageal cancer. Preliminary clinical results showed that immunotherapy combined with&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy provided a synergies antitumor effect. Multiple clinical results showed&#xD;
      that Carrillizumab provided higher overall response rate for advanced esophageal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, in patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer, the efficacy of Carrillizumab&#xD;
      combined with chemotherapy and apatinib for sequential radical surgery is still unclear. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to observe and evaluate the efficacy and safety of Carrillizumab&#xD;
      combined with chemotherapy and antiangiogenic drugs in the neoadjuvant therapy of resectable&#xD;
      esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.&#xD;

      Esophageal cancer is a common malignant tumor of the digestive tract. Every year, there are&#xD;
      about 400,000 new cases of esophageal cancer in the world and about 300,000 people dying of&#xD;
      this disease. China with high incidence of esophageal cancer, the number of new cases and&#xD;
      deaths account for about 50% of the world every year. In the past few decades, surgery,&#xD;
      radiotherapy, chemotherapy and other treatments were continuously improved, however, the&#xD;
      mortality of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients was not significantly decreased.&#xD;
      Early local invasion, lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis are the main causes of&#xD;
      poor prognosis for the patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer, direct surgery is not effective. It is&#xD;
      difficult to achieve radical resection by surgery merely, and even if many patients receive&#xD;
      surgery, they may eventually have tumor recurrence and poor survival rate. Therefore, it is&#xD;
      necessary to explore effective perioperative neoadjuvant treatment to reduce the risk of&#xD;
      postoperative recurrence and improve the postoperative survival rate of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, PD-1 antibody is undoubtedly the most dazzling star in the field of tumor&#xD;
      therapy. It shows excellent efficacy in of the different kind of tumors. According to the&#xD;
      reports, the expression of PD-L1 in esophageal cancer was about 41.4% (Meta-analysis of 1350&#xD;
      Chinese and Japanese subjects showed that the over-expression of PD-L1 tended to decrease&#xD;
      overall survival). Therefore, PD-1/ PD-L1 immunocheckpoint inhibitor may become a new method&#xD;
      for the treatment of esophageal cancer. Preliminary clinical results showed that&#xD;
      immunotherapy combined with chemoradiotherapy provided a synergies antitumor effect. Multiple&#xD;
      clinical results showed that Carrillizumab provided higher overall response rate for advanced&#xD;
      esophageal cancer. It also provided superior progression free survival and overall survival&#xD;
      compared with Pembrolizuma and paclitaxel. 2020 Chinese Society Of Clinical Oncology&#xD;
      esophagus cancer guidelines recommended Carrillizumab as the first level for squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, in patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer, the efficacy of Carrillizumab&#xD;
      combined with chemotherapy and apatinib for sequential radical surgery is still unclear. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to observe and evaluate the efficacy and safety of Carrillizumab&#xD;
      combined with chemotherapy and antiangiogenic drugs in the neoadjuvant therapy of resectable&#xD;
      esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.&#xD;
