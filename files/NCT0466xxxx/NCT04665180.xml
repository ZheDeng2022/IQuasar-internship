  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The increase of end-stage osteoarthritis (OA) in an increasingly younger population is&#xD;
      directly correlated with the rising incidence of obesity. As a result, knee arthroplasty&#xD;
      (KA), which is a definitive end-stage treatment option, is increasingly performed on working&#xD;
      age people. Knowledge and understanding of the underlying factors that drive the ability for&#xD;
      people to return to work is crucial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First and foremost, the investigators would have like to have a clear idea of the percentage&#xD;
      of patients who return to work and at what time postoperatively. The investigators would also&#xD;
      determine the different factors influencing employment in the patient population after&#xD;
      undergoing a knee arthroplasty and register the evolution in the necessity of pain medication&#xD;
      pre-and postoperatively. Ideally, the investigators can include a short questionnaire&#xD;
      regarding return to sports to gather valuable information.&#xD;

      pre-and postoperatively. Ideally, the investigators can include a short questionnaire&#xD;
      regarding return to sports to gather valuable information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult patients with an indication for primary knee arthroplasty (total + unicondylar) can&#xD;
      take part in the study. This will be decided by clinical examination and radiographic&#xD;
      evaluation, having the result of the previous therapies and the patient-specific needs in&#xD;
      mind (standard of care). The patients have to be younger than or equal to 63 years old at the&#xD;
      time of surgery and actively been working 2 years prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In line with the standard of care, the patients will be seen after 4-8 weeks, 3-4 months and&#xD;
      1 year postoperatively. Radiological examinations are foreseen at 4-8 weeks and 1 year&#xD;
      postoperatively (standard of care). Pre-operatively, a general questionnaire is filled in by&#xD;
      the patients. The patient questionnaires Knee Society Score (KSS), Knee Injury and&#xD;
      Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Forgotten Knee Joint Score, Quickscan, Work,&#xD;
      Osteoarthritis and joint-Replacement Questionnaire (WORQ) will be filled in by the patients&#xD;
      during the screening visit and on each consultation at 4-8 weeks, 3-4 months, 6 months, 1&#xD;
      year and 1,5 year. The Tegner score will be filled in by the patients pre-operatively and at&#xD;
      1 year postoperatively.&#xD;
