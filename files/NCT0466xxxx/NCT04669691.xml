    <textblock>
      The purpose/aim of this study is to evaluate responses to vaccination with different MF59&#xD;
      adjuvanted pandemic influenza vaccine formulations of an H5N1 vaccine in pediatric subjects.&#xD;
      The data from this study are intended to provide information for health authorities to&#xD;
      determine the best formulation for protection of children during the pandemic phase of a&#xD;
      pandemic of a novel pandemic influenza strain (World Health Organization (WHO) 2013).&#xD;
