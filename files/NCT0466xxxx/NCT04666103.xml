  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent trends in the management of patients with low-risk papillary thyroid carcinoma who&#xD;
      have a nonsuspicious or cytologically benign contralateral nodule call into question the need&#xD;
      for routine total thyroidectomy. Although the lobectomy for the unilateral thyroid cancer&#xD;
      with contralateral benign nodules is sufficient treatment, some of the patients might suffer&#xD;
      from the anxiety of the residual benign thyroid nodule and tend to choose total&#xD;
      thyroidectomy, which might be overtreatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thermal ablation has been proven to be effective in achieving nodule shrinkage and being also&#xD;
      free from major complications. In our institution, intraoperative RFA was a proposed&#xD;
      alternative strategy to treat the contralateral benign nodules after the thyroid lobectomy&#xD;
      for the malignant lobe, which was found to have a better quality of life on anxiety,&#xD;
      physiological health, social family, psychological and sensory mentions with a considerable&#xD;
      complication rate.&#xD;

    <description>Thyroid lobectomy was performed with a standard technique of fine capsular en bloc dissection and resection, from inferior pole to superior pole. Superior parathyroid glands were identified and preserved in situ, inferior parathyroid glands were protected in situ or autotransplanted in the sternocleidomastoid muscle according to three certain types based on their blood supply and location. All the patients underwent lobectomy received ipsilateral therapic central compartment neck dissection. After the thyroid lobectomy, the contralateral benign thyroid nodule was treated with intraoperative thermal ablation. The &quot;hydrodissection technique&quot; was used during the ablation process to prevent recurrent laryngeal nerve, esophageal and other important structures from being destroyed by heat energy.</description>
