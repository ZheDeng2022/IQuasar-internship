  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A study to compare the accuracy of achieving the planned correction between personalised&#xD;
      (TOKA) high tibial osteotomy (HTO) procedure and standard generic HTO procedure.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial design is a multi-centre, blinded, superiority two arm, parallel group design&#xD;
      randomised controlled trial (RCT) of personalised (TOKA) versus standard high tibial&#xD;
      osteotomy (HTO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the PASHiOn trial is to establish whether digitally planned personalised HTO&#xD;
      surgery (TOKA) increases the accuracy of bone correction in comparison to conventional HTO&#xD;
      surgery. Embedded within the trial is a non-randomised pre-RCT technology check and safety&#xD;
      assessment of 5 patients (Phase 1), followed by a randomised controlled trial of 88 patients&#xD;
      (Phase 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During phase 1 of the clinical investigation, 5 patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria&#xD;
      will be recruited and assessed in an identical way to the 88 patients recruited in the main&#xD;
      trial, but without randomisation. Recruitment of the remaining patients (Phase 2) will take&#xD;
      place after the six-week assessment on the fifth patient is complete and the oversight&#xD;
      committee supports progression to Phase 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomised to Phase 2 in a 1:1 ratio and patients will be blinded as to&#xD;
      which treatment arm they receive.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in coronal plane location of peak loading during gait, in comparison to baseline, measured by Video Vector</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months post-randomisation (6 months post-surgery)</time_frame>
    <description>Video Vector Analysis (VVA) will be used at baseline and at 9 months post randomisation. VVA simultaneously records ground reaction force data from a force plate and video data from a video camera focussed on the lower limb of a participant. This enables the magnitude, orientation, and location of the ground reaction force to be determined relative to the limb under investigation.</description>

    <measure>Patient reported outcomes - Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 and 12 months post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>KOOS is a patient reported outcome measure derived from 5 subscales; symptoms (including stiffness), pain, function (daily living), function (sports and recreation activities) and quality of life with scores ranging from 0 - 100, a higher score indicating better health.</description>

    <description>VAS will be used to measure patient reported pain. Patients will be requested to mark on a scale of 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain) the number that represents their knee pain. A second VAS score will measure soft tissue irritation. Patients will be requested to mark on a scale of 0 (no irritation) to 10 (worst possible irritation) the number that represents their amount of irritation they feel from the plate in their knee.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient reported outcomes - University of Carolina, Los Angeles Activity Score (UCLA Activity Score)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 and 12 months post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The UCLA Activity Score is a scale ranging from 1 to 10.

General health will also be collected, and the participants will be asked to compare their general health now, to one year ago.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient reported outcomes - Health resource use (visits to primary care and hospital care services)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 and 12 months post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>This study will collect information on participants' health resource use, including time in operating theatre, visits to primary care, and hospital care services, during the follow-up.

    <time_frame>9 months post-randomisation (6 months post-surgery)</time_frame>
    <description>Computer models based upon the CT geometry and informed by the achieved correction and video vector analysis will be used to calculate the change in knee loading due to the HTO surgery for each patient. This will enable the relationship between amount of correction, change in loading and outcome to be examined with the aim of optimising HTO surgery.</description>
