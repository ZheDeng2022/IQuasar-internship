  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is focused in the development of a screening test for the people at risk&#xD;
      of colo-rectal cancer (aged more than 50 years old), valid and safe, improving the screening&#xD;
      prognosis increasing the sensitivity and sensitive as compared with the current method, fecal&#xD;
      occult blood.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colo-rectal cancer (CCR) is one of the most prevalent cancers in developed countries. Several&#xD;
      studies suggest that the CCR may be related with changes in the gut microbiota. This clinical&#xD;
      trial is focused in the development of a screening test for the people at risk of CCR (aged&#xD;
      more than 50 years old), valid and safe, improving the screening prognosis. The main&#xD;
      potential improvement lies in the fact that the proposed method is more specific and&#xD;
      sensitive than the current method, fecal occult blood. It aims to distinguish whether the&#xD;
      positive results for fecal occult blood test is due to fissures, not related with CCR (which&#xD;
      are positive for fecal occult blood, false positive) or was caused by a cancer-related&#xD;
      lesion. The methodology derived will also improve the sensitive as sometimes the polyps do&#xD;
      not leak blood. Based in the previous differences found in the gut microbiota composition&#xD;
      related with CCR for several research groups, the gut microbiota composition will be used as&#xD;
      diagnosis tool.&#xD;

    <description>Patients with positive results in the fecal occult blood test in the Program for Early Detection of Colon and Rectal Cancer, undergone by the Consejeria de Salud de la Junta de Andalucia (Spain), were invited to participate in the CCR-microbiome study. This program is screening Andalusian population aged between 50 and 69 years old for colo-rectal cancer presence by fecal occult blood test, and further colonoscopy when positive for this test. Patients included in CCR-microbiome study were recruited between January 2017 and March 2020, at the Reina Sofia University Hospital (Cordoba, Spain) with the consumption of antibiotic within the previous month as exclusion criteria.</description>
