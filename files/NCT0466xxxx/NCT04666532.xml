  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical site infections (SSI) are a significant clinical issue that requires the use of a&#xD;
      great amount of resources. In particular, periprosthetic joint infections (PJIs) have&#xD;
      potentially catastrophic effects on patients' health-related quality of life, function,&#xD;
      healthcare costs, outcomes and medical implications. National surveillance estimates may&#xD;
      under-report the true incidence and when considering the large number of total hip (THA) and&#xD;
      total knee arthroplasty (TKA) procedures performed each year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have a high-level of nasal bacteria have been found to have a risk of surgical&#xD;
      site infection that is three to six times the risk compared with noncarriers and low-level&#xD;
      carriers. The association between a patient's nasal carriage of S. aureus, specifically MRSA,&#xD;
      and PJI has been demonstrated in a systematic review and confirmed in recent cohort studies.&#xD;
      While this association seems to be well accepted, no mechanistic explanation has been&#xD;
      provided for this association.&#xD;
