  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preoperative fasting is defined as refraining from food for at least 6 hours and clear fluids&#xD;
      for at least 2 hours prior to anaesthesia. On the one hand, it is a procedure that reduces&#xD;
      the risk of aspiration of food content and the occurrence of Mendelson's syndrome, and on the&#xD;
      other hand, it was considered to be the cause of disturbances in water management in patients&#xD;
      undergoing general anaesthesia. However, reports from recent years have found that moderate&#xD;
      preoperative fasting does not influence the risk of hypovolemia in anesthetized patients. It&#xD;
      is also known that in fasting people the total body water is reduced. Thus, it can be assumed&#xD;
      that there are mechanisms causing the movement of extravascular water into the lumen of blood&#xD;
      vessels. For several years, the Body Composition Monitor (BCM) device for non-invasive&#xD;
      measurement of the volume of individual water compartments of the human body has been&#xD;
      available on the market. It allows to determine the volume of total body water, intracellular&#xD;
      body water and extracellular body water. It is mainly used during dialysis, but it can also&#xD;
      be used in other circumstances that require the determination of the body's hydration status.&#xD;
      The principle of this method is based on non-invasive bioimpedance measurement with the use&#xD;
      of 4 electrodes placed on two extremities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to determine whether there is a fluid shift between the intracellular&#xD;
      and extracellular compartments in people undergoing preoperative fasting. Examination of this&#xD;
      issue would allow for the development of hypothesis regarding the optimal perioperative fluid&#xD;
      therapy. If there was a shift of fluid from the intracellular space, it seems more rational&#xD;
      to supplement fluid deficiencies resulting from starvation with a 5% glucose solution. If, on&#xD;
      the other hand, no fluid shift from the intracellular space was detected, which would suggest&#xD;
      shifts within the extracellular space, it would be advisable to hydrate the patient with&#xD;
      crystalloid solutions.&#xD;
