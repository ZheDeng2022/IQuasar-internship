    <textblock>
      Randomized, controlled, blind, single-center and non-inferiority clinical trial to compare&#xD;
      the target lesion failure (TLF) at 12 months in patients with diabetes mellitus who underwent&#xD;
      percutaneous coronary intervention with an Orsiro stent vs. Abluminus stent.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Worldwide, and especially in Mexico, there is a high incidence of diabetes mellitus (DM),&#xD;
      which in turn, confers a higher cardiovascular risk in this population. Diabetic patients&#xD;
      undergoing PCI have worse outcomes than non-diabetics regardless of the degree of complexity&#xD;
      of their coronary anatomy. Although the 30-day in-hospital outcomes have been similar between&#xD;
      diabetic and non-diabetic patients, DM has been invariably associated with greater stent&#xD;
      failure with target vessel revascularization (TVR), major adverse cardiovascular event&#xD;
      (MACE), and mortality in the long-term follow-up, even with the use of drug-eluting stents.&#xD;
      In relation to the above, two of the sirolimus-eluting stents (SES): the Abluminus and the&#xD;
      Orsiro, have been considered as promising options in patients with DM. The Abluminus stent&#xD;
      has been designed for diabetic patients in order to reduce cardiovascular events. Said stent&#xD;
      consists of a cobalt-chromium platform covered with a layer of biodegradable polymer and&#xD;
      mounted on a balloon, both sirolimus-releasing. The Rate of target lesion failure (TLF)&#xD;
      reported to date in diabetic patients is 3.8%. On the other hand, the Orsiro stent, a&#xD;
      cobalt-chromium platform with ultrathin struts, has had favorable results in different&#xD;
      clinical settings and patients with different characteristics]; specifically in a subgroup&#xD;
      analysis in DM, a TLF rate of 3.5% was reported&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Diabetic patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention in de novo lesions are going to be randomized to two groups. One will have percutaneous coronary intervention with Abluminus sirolimus eluting stent implantation, and the other will have percutaneous coronary intervention with Orsiro Sirolimus Eluting stent implantation. The implantation of both stents will be guided by angiography only. In a subgroup of both arms (100 patients per group) the implantation will be also guided by intravascular ultrasound.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Cardiovascular Death</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Cardiovascular death is defined as death resulting from cardiovascular causes. The following categories may be collected:&#xD;
Death caused by acute MI&#xD;
Death caused by sudden cardiac, including unwitnessed, death&#xD;
Death resulting from heart failure&#xD;
Death caused by stroke&#xD;
Death caused by cardiovascular procedures&#xD;
Death resulting from cardiovascular hemorrhage&#xD;
Death resulting from other cardiovascular cause&#xD;
Any MI not clearly attributable to a non-target vessel will be considered as target-vessel MI.&#xD;
Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) related MI is termed type 4a MI.&#xD;
Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) related MI is termed type 5 MI. Revascularization is clinically driven if the target lesion diameter stenosis is &gt; 50% by quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) and the subject has clinical or functional ischemia which cannot be explained by another native coronary or bypass graft lesion.</description>
