    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective observational research study to describe the characteristics and&#xD;
      real-world clinical outcomes of patients with locally advanced, unresectable Stage III&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer receiving durvalumab in the United Kingdom (the CODAK study).&#xD;
      Physicians who have treated patients who have locally advanced, unresectable Stage III NSCLC&#xD;
      with durvalumab will be requested to recruit patients to have their clinical data abstracted&#xD;
      from their clinical records in line with local laws. Data from this study will provide&#xD;
      UK-specific real-world data on patients receiving durvalumab through the Early Access&#xD;
      Programme (EAP) or post-reimbursement.&#xD;

      Primary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study objectives, in patients with locally advanced, unresectable Stage III NSCLC&#xD;
      treated with durvalumab as part of the UK EAP or non-EAP, are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To describe clinical outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To describe the patient demographic and clinical characteristics Secondary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To describe treatment patterns of durvalumab&#xD;
