  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal cord injury (SCI), induced by damage to the spinal cord, can cause life-altering&#xD;
      levels of disability including the development of chronic pain. Central Neuropathic Pain&#xD;
      (CNP) typically develops within months after injury in 40-50% of SCI patients, affecting&#xD;
      everyday activity, sleep and mood. There is no cure for CNP, it can be very difficult to&#xD;
      treat and is often refractory to any pharmacological treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a previous study (study no. 14/WS/1029) the principle investigators showed that the&#xD;
      likelihood of CNP developing can be predicted by defining characteristics of brain waves that&#xD;
      are related to pain. We will use electroencephalograph (EEG) to measure brain activity in&#xD;
      people early after SCI, before they develop pain, knowing that about half will develop pain&#xD;
      within a year. We aim to recruit 80 participants, aged 18-80; 40 with subacute spinal injury&#xD;
      (level C3-T12) and no symptoms of CNP; 20 with symptoms of CNP and 20 able-bodied&#xD;
      participants. Completeness of injury is irrelevant. Patients will be recruited by clinical&#xD;
      consultants within national spinal units in Glasgow and Stoke Mandeville. Patients will&#xD;
      undergo two EEG recording sessions in which they will imagine movements while we record EEG.&#xD;
      Sessions will also involve basic sensory testing and completion of questionnaires.&#xD;
      Able-bodied participants will be recruited by the Philosophy Doctor (PhD) candidate at the&#xD;
      University of Glasgow and undergo only one EEG session (identical to SCI patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is to use early EEG markers of CNP to optimise and validate an&#xD;
      existing computer program based on machine learning to enable more accurate prediction of&#xD;
      pain in newly injured patients with the hope of aiding future treatments. Secondary aims&#xD;
      include characterising EEG features which might describe different phases in patients'&#xD;
      development of CNP and exploring possible differences between pain at/below the level of SCI&#xD;
      based on EEG markers.&#xD;

      Study Design The proposed study will be a longitudinal cohort study in which participants&#xD;
      will attend one assessment session as inpatients in the subacute stage and a further&#xD;
      assessment six months later, during which time patients are likely to be outpatients. Each&#xD;
      session will last up to two hours and questionnaires may be completed within the hospital or&#xD;
      outside. To minimise the drop-out, patients will be followed-up though their regular visits&#xD;
      to the Queen Elizabeth National Spinal Injuries Uni (QENSIU) or Stoke Mandeville National&#xD;
      Spinal Injuries Centre (NSIC) to categorise occurrence of pain, based on the recommended&#xD;
      criteria for CNP and the International Spinal Cord Injury Pain Classification System. For&#xD;
      those unable to attend the follow-up session, Co-Investigators will take information from&#xD;
      their patient notes about their pain, allodynia and hyperalgesia in order to ensure that pain&#xD;
      status is collected twice for all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be carried out on 20 able bodied and 60 subacute SCI patients, 40 with no CNP,&#xD;
      and 20 with CNP (refer to section 8 for group size considerations). All patients will attend&#xD;
      two recording sessions, 2 hours in length, during which time they will undergo EEG recordings&#xD;
      as well as sensory testing (including mechanical and thermal tests). This is based on&#xD;
      protocol used with the previous cohort. The first test will be carried out as soon as the&#xD;
      patients' health condition allows them to sit for the duration of the experiment (this could&#xD;
      be within first 3-6 months post injury as Stoke Mandeville Natioanl Spinal Injury Centre&#xD;
      (NSIC) does not admit any early injury patients) and the second assessment will take place&#xD;
      approximately 6 months later. Able-bodied participants will attend only one session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment QENSIU admits around 110 new patients annually whilst Stoke Mandeville Hospital&#xD;
      admits around 200. This gives 600 potential volunteers over a 2 year period which should be&#xD;
      sufficient to recruit the targeted number. It is planned to recruit approximately half of&#xD;
      participants (around 30 people with SCI) from each centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be identified and approached by their clinical consultants (Co-Investigators Dr&#xD;
      Mariel Purcell and Dr Maurizio Belci). Prior to participating, patients will be given&#xD;
      information sheets and consent forms to sign and should the participant themselves be unable&#xD;
      to physically sign, a witnessed proxy can do so on the patient's behalf.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Able bodied participants will be recruited by advertising the study at the University of&#xD;
      Glasgow and their data will be collected within the University of Glasgow Rehabilitation&#xD;
      Engineering laboratory on University Campus. They will be recruited by the PhD student.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments The patient participants will attend one assessment session as inpatients in the&#xD;
      subacute stage and a further assessment six months later. Experimental and data collection&#xD;
      procedures will be identical in both the first and second assessments undertaken by patients.&#xD;
      This includes EEG recordings, sensory testing and questionnaires. Able bodied participants&#xD;
      will only attend one assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Procedures Questionnaires During assessment sessions, all patients will be asked&#xD;
      to complete questionnaires which will allow us collect data on the status of their pain at&#xD;
      the time of each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following questionnaires will be given to patients who at the time of assessment&#xD;
      experience CNP:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Brief Pain Inventory&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  McGill pain questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neuropathic Pain Symptoms Inventory&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multidimensional health locus of control (referring to spinal cord injury as&#xD;
           &quot;condition&quot;)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain catastrophising scale (referring to the existing pain)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who at the time of first assessment already had pain will be asked to repeat only&#xD;
      first two questionnaires on the second assessment, after 6 months. It takes approximately 30&#xD;
      min to fill out all 5 questionnaires. Patients can fill out questionnaires at their own time.&#xD;
      Outpatients (second assessment) will receive questionnaires and an envelope with a stamp to&#xD;
      post it, or they could alternatively take scan/photos of questionnaires and send them to&#xD;
      research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with no pain will be asked to complete:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Brief Pain Inventory&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multidimensional health locus of control (referring to spinal cord injury as&#xD;
           &quot;condition&quot;)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Able bodied participants will be asked to fill out the Brief Pain Inventory. All patients&#xD;
      with CNP will be diagnosed prior to the study as part of their regular treatment at the&#xD;
      hospital. The diagnosis is based on recommendations by the International Spinal Cord&#xD;
      Association.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Equipment All equipment has necessary medical device Certificate Europe (CE) mark. Both&#xD;
      spinal units (QENSIU and NSIC) and University facilities (for able-bodied assessments) have&#xD;
      the same equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensory Tests We will use existing clinical American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) testing&#xD;
      information to assess the level and completes of injury i.e. we will gain this information&#xD;
      from patient notes following assessment performed by healthcare professional.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be tested for mechanical and thermal sensations at the foot and shin of&#xD;
      both legs and on the trapezoidal muscle on both sides. These are recommended sensory sites&#xD;
      from the literature for the following reasons: the feet and shanks are under the level of&#xD;
      injury in both tetra and paraplegic patients and are typically reported as locations where&#xD;
      most patients with SCI CNP report pain. Trapezoidal muscles are above the level of injury for&#xD;
      all patients. Testing only 3 sites on both sides should minimise total assessment time and&#xD;
      reduce patients' inconvenience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensory mechanical assessments will comprise a determination of light touch and pinprick&#xD;
      which will also serve as a sign of allodynia and hyperalgesia. A mechanical wind up test&#xD;
      (with monofilament no. 6.65) will be performed and sensory thermal tests will be conducted&#xD;
      using a device named &quot;Rolltemp&quot; (manufacturer &quot;Somedic SenseLab&quot; ). This device consists of&#xD;
      two rollers on handles, one roller being warm and the other cold. These are rolled over the&#xD;
      skin of the patients who are able to determine the corresponding sensations. Sensory testing&#xD;
      will take 30-40 min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Able bodied participants will not undergo sensory tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EEG Recording EEG will be recorded from 64 locations over the entire scalp according to the&#xD;
      American Clinical Neurophysiology Society's 10-10 system. EEG will be recorded with a g.Tech&#xD;
      biosignal USB amplifier (Guger Technologies, Austria) which enables on-line EEG measurement,&#xD;
      signal analysis and visualisation of EEG signals on a computer screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Markers of longstanding CNP are present in both spontaneous and induced states such as during&#xD;
      motor imagination. As such, EEG activity will first be recorded in the relaxed state of all&#xD;
      patients with eyes open and eyes closed (spontaneous EEG), followed by EEG recording during&#xD;
      cue-based motor imagination as done previously with the original cohort. This study showed&#xD;
      that the presence of CNP affects cortical areas of both paralysed and non-paralysed limbs.&#xD;
      Induced EEG will be recorded during cue-based motor imagination where the task will comprise&#xD;
      patients sitting in front of a computer screen and undergoing several trials imagining waving&#xD;
      their left hand, right hand or tapping both feet. The motor imagery session will be separated&#xD;
      into 6 sub sessions each last approximately 5 minutes, to minimise patient discomfort due to&#xD;
      tiredness and increased level of concentration. Duration of the EEG recording including&#xD;
      setup, breaks and active participation will be up to 1.5 hours. Patients will be allowed to&#xD;
      use their mobile phone or to read during the setup period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, sensory tests and EEG recording will take approximately 2 hours and will be&#xD;
      performed on the same day. Filling out self-administered questionnaires will take up to an&#xD;
      additional 30 min and may be carried out on the same day or separately. During the first&#xD;
      assessment patients will get advice and assistance from researchers when completing the&#xD;
      questionnaires. For the second assessment they will be able to fill them out at home on their&#xD;
      own.&#xD;
