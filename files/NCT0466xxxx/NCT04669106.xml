  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nutritional deficiency disease is a disease caused by nutritional deficiencies, including&#xD;
      macronutrients and micronutrients. Macronutrient diseases are diseases caused by deficiency&#xD;
      of protein, fat and carbohydrates. This deficiency will usually show clinical symptoms that&#xD;
      directly affect nutritional status. This study aims to study and examine mineral intake,&#xD;
      dietary patterns of research subjects, mineral and enzyme levels, and soil condition data.&#xD;
      The number of research subjects to be taken was 180 subjects with 90 research subjects coming&#xD;
      from mothers who had healthy children and 90 research subjects came from mothers who had&#xD;
      stunted children or other nutritional disorders. The research stage will run after going&#xD;
      through the inclusion of research subjects, namely mothers who have healthy children and&#xD;
      mothers who have nutritionally deficient children, aged 20-40 years. The research stage&#xD;
      consisted of two stages. The statistical analysis used is to use the ANOVA test, which will&#xD;
      then compile a manuscript.&#xD;

      This study aims to study and examine mineral intake, dietary patterns of research subjects,&#xD;
      mineral and enzyme levels, and soil condition data. The number of research subjects to be&#xD;
      taken was 180 subjects with 90 research subjects coming from mothers who had healthy children&#xD;
      and 90 research subjects came from mothers who had stunted children or other nutritional&#xD;
      disorders. The research stage will run after going through the inclusion of research&#xD;
      subjects, namely mothers who have healthy children and mothers who have nutritionally&#xD;
      deficient children, aged 20-40 years. The research stage consisted of two stages. The&#xD;
      statistical analysis used is to use the ANOVA test, which will then compile a manuscript.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research is a case control study, with primary data collection, is a laboratory clinical&#xD;
      trial study on the subject of mothers who have children aged 2-3 years, aged 20-40 years. The&#xD;
      number of research subjects to be taken was 180 subjects with 90 research subjects coming&#xD;
      from mothers who had healthy children and 90 research subjects came from mothers who had&#xD;
      stunted children or other nutritional disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research stage consisted of two stages, the first stage was the initial screening of the&#xD;
      primary data of the research subjects, namely by analyzing food intake including mineral&#xD;
      intake data, the diet of the research subjects, mineral and enzyme levels, and data on soil&#xD;
      conditions in the area. The second stage was to analyze the relationship between the existing&#xD;
      variables so that the most significant relationship was seen between the differences in diet,&#xD;
      mineral content, enzyme levels, and soil content between the two groups. The statistical&#xD;
      analysis used was to use the ANOVA test.&#xD;
