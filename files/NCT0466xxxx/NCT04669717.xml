  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Periodontitits is a bacteria induced inflammatory disease that destroys the supporting&#xD;
      tissues of the tooth and leads to tooth loss. Treatment consists mainly of the mechanical&#xD;
      cleaning of the tooth surfaces in order to remove the bacterial deposits (plaque and&#xD;
      calculus). This procedure can reduce the level of pathogenic bacteria but it can not&#xD;
      eradicate them. In severe cases, for the complete resolution of the disease, the elimantion&#xD;
      of certain species of bacteria is needed. In order to achieve that, the combination of&#xD;
      different regimens of antibiotics adjunctive to the mechanical treatment has been proposed.&#xD;
      However, dosage and duration of antimicrobial therapy should be optimal and not excessive as&#xD;
      issues may arise related to increased antimicrobial resistance in the population and the&#xD;
      individual due to habitual prescription of wide-spectrum antibiotic regimens, horizontal gene&#xD;
      transfer and genetic mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, in an effort to optimize the dosage and duration of the antimicrobial&#xD;
      regimen, we will determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) properties of&#xD;
      the MET-AMO combination and of AZI in Gingival Crevicular Fluid (GCF), saliva and serum in&#xD;
      severe periodontitis patients during and after either a 3-day or a 7-day course of treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, 3-arm parallel group, single-blind, comparative superiority and&#xD;
      exploratory clinical trial of 44 months involving 45 patients with periodontitis attending&#xD;
      the Division of Regenarative Dental Medecine and Periodontology of the University of Geneva.&#xD;
      First, a routine clinical and radiographic periodontal examination will be conducted by a&#xD;
      periodontist. Treatment will be done in 2 appointments by mechanical debridement of the&#xD;
      diseased sites by two experienced clinicians. At the end of the treatment, one third of the&#xD;
      patients will be assigned for treatment with 500mgAMO+ 500mgMET 3 times a day during 1 week,&#xD;
      one third for treatment with 500mgAMO+ 500mgMET 3 times a day during 3 days and the last&#xD;
      third for treatment with 500mg AZI once a day for 3 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical samples will be taken at Days 0, 2, 4 and 8 after the start of the antibiotic&#xD;
      administration . Gingival Crevicular Fluid (GCF) will be collected from four sites with&#xD;
      paperpoints, blood sample by finger puncture, unstimulated saliva and subgingival plaque from&#xD;
      four sites with paper points. The concentration and duration effect of AMO+MET and AZI in&#xD;
      GCF, saliva and serum will be assessed in the Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology at the&#xD;
      University Hospital of Lausanne (CHUV) by high performance liquid chromatography coupled to&#xD;
      tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The microbiological effect on 6 selected organisms will&#xD;
      be assessed by RT-PCR at 3 and 6 months after treatment. The clinical results will be&#xD;
      evaluated 6 months later. The study duration for the patient will be approximately 8 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All adverse events (AE) and all serious adverse events (SAEs) will be recorded and addressed.&#xD;
