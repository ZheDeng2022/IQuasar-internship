    <description>REmotely Monitored, Mhealth (REMM) supported High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) The intervention consists of high intensity interval training, consisting of a 30-minute exercise session that includes 10 x 1-minute intervals of high intensity 3x/week (e.g., Monday, Wednesday, Friday) and supplemented with 2 sessions per week of strength, balance, and mobility exercises (e.g., Tuesday, Thursday). Exercise will be supported by an activity tracker, which will allow study personnel to track patient heart rates during exercise on a daily basis, allowing them to provide individualized feedback and coaching.</description>
