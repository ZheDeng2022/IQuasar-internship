      The aim of the study is to compare the effects of stretching exercises &amp; muscle energy&#xD;
      techniques in the management of lower cross syndrome and to find the effective treatment in&#xD;
      the lower cross syndrome management.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2015 the systematic review estimated that prevalence of Chronic low back pain in 24 to 39&#xD;
      year old individual was 4.2% and the individual between 20 to 59 was 19.6% . The genesis and&#xD;
      perpetuation of Low back pain (LBP) has many underlying factors among which one is proposed&#xD;
      by Janda's concept of pelvic crossed syndrome. This condition describes a pattern of tight&#xD;
      and weak muscles around the pelvis. Marked postural deviation is seen such as increased&#xD;
      lumber lordosis and depending on this lordosis the muscle involvement can be distinguished.&#xD;
      The center of the gravity is slightly anterior to S1 or S2, which means pelvis position, is&#xD;
      key to faulty or good alignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various studies have been done on muscle imbalance Lower crossed syndrome (LCS) using&#xD;
      Stretching and Muscle energy Technique (MET). Both have shown superior effects when compared&#xD;
      to other treatment modalities/techniques. However there is paucity of literature on&#xD;
      effectiveness of stretching and MET in management of LCS.&#xD;
