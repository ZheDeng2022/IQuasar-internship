  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low RAIU in patients with hyperthyroidism represents a common obstacle in the treatment with&#xD;
      RAI. Therefore, a higher dose of RAI must be administered to cure hyperthyroidism in these&#xD;
      patients. If we treat patients with thiamazole before starting RAI treatment, serum TSH will&#xD;
      rise and result in an increase in iodine uptake by the thyroid gland. By doing so, the dose&#xD;
      of RAI to be administered might be lowered to achieve similar therapeutic efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the past, either calculated or fixed doses of 131I have been used to treat&#xD;
      hyperthyroidism. The supposed advantage of a calculated dose compared to a fixed dose is the&#xD;
      lowering of hypothyroidism frequency. However, various research papers have contradicted this&#xD;
      statement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antithyroid drugs and RAI therapy have been widely used in the past, either in combination,&#xD;
      or independent from one another. This has been done primarily in older patients, to reduce&#xD;
      the risk of exacerbation of hyperthyroid symptoms after initiation of RAI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of propylthiouracil has been shown to decrease the response rate after RAI due to&#xD;
      radioprotective effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of methimazole and carbimazole did not have a negative effect on treatment failure,&#xD;
      as long as the medication was discontinued various days before RAI administration. Although&#xD;
      this statement is contested in other studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is interesting to evaluate retrospective data of patients treated with RAI to evaluate&#xD;
      prognostic factors of treatment respons and post RAI hypothyroidism.&#xD;
