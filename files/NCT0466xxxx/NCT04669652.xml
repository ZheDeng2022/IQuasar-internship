  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) has successfully been used to treat both severe male&#xD;
      infertility and fertilization failure since its introduction in the early 1990Â´s. During the&#xD;
      procedure a single sperm is injected into the cytoplasm of an oocyte to achieve&#xD;
      fertilization. This technique is intrusive, has a relatively long learning curve and variable&#xD;
      operator performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new injection technique called piezo-ICSI has recently been introduced. During piezo-ICSI,&#xD;
      a piezo-electric effect is generated through the conversion of electric energy to mechanical&#xD;
      energy. This causes a smooth movement of the injection pipette, which allows for steady,&#xD;
      controlled microinjections with less psychical stress applied on the oocytes than by the&#xD;
      conventional technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent analysis, based on data from 9 different studies comparing conventional ICSI and&#xD;
      piezo-ICSI (17500 cases), showed a benefit of piezo. Unfortunately, proper randomized trials&#xD;
      are missing from this analysis. The proposed study is a randomized controlled study carried&#xD;
      out at two private IVF clinics. Eligible participants are patients undergoing ICSI treatment,&#xD;
      with a minimum of 6 oocytes. The participants will act as their own controls, with their&#xD;
      oocytes randomly and equally divided between injection by the investigated and the&#xD;
      conventional technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whether piezo-ICSI is associated with improved success rates or reduction in adverse outcomes&#xD;
      is at present unclear. Patients with fragile oocytes may benefit more from piezo-ICSI. In&#xD;
      patients above 35 years, piezo-ICSI has been associated with a lower oocyte degeneration rate&#xD;
      and an increased blastocyst rate. The aim of the study is to investigate whether the&#xD;
      piezo-ICSI technique will result in more oocytes becoming normally fertilized compared to&#xD;
      conventional ICSI. Another proposed benefit of piezo-ICSI lies in the standardization and&#xD;
      simplification of the ICSI procedure. Making the injection procedure more independent of&#xD;
      operator skill may result in a more robust and predictable laboratory output.&#xD;
