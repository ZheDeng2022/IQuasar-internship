  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective is to evaluate the efficacy of IV administration of the P2Y12 inhibitor&#xD;
      (cangrelor) in addition to mecanich thrombectomy and WMD versus mecanich thrombectomy and WMD&#xD;
      alone on the functional prognosis at 3 months, in patients with acute ischemic stroke&#xD;
      eligible for mecanich thrombectomy on the basis of infusion imaging between 0 and 24 hours&#xD;
      after the onset of symptoms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The emergent reperfusion of the ischemic penumbra is the goal of acute ischemic stroke (AIS)&#xD;
      treatment. Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) may be proposed up to 6 hours and from 6 to 24 hours&#xD;
      after stroke onset if multimodal imaging demonstrates the presence of a substantial ischemic&#xD;
      penumbra.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the major benefit associated with MT, more than half of patients will remain disabled&#xD;
      at 3 months. The rate of complete reperfusion after MT appears to be a major factor affecting&#xD;
      functional outcome. However, this rate of complete reperfusion is only achieved in 50 % of&#xD;
      the patients due to, at least in part, distal microcirculatory impairment and or erratic&#xD;
      emboli.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In coronary artery disease, new antiplatelet agents, with a very short half-life, such as&#xD;
      P2Y12 inhibitors (P2Y12I), have been shown to reduce in-stent thrombosis, myocardial&#xD;
      infarction and death. The IV route for P2Y12 inhibitors administration is adapted to the&#xD;
      stroke population who has frequently dysphagia that prevents per os drug administration. In&#xD;
      addition, the very short half-life of the drug is quite interesting for the management of&#xD;
      hemorrhagic complications or emergent surgical interventions and early antithrombotic&#xD;
      secondary prevention initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hpothesis: subgroup of patients treated from 0 to 24 hours after onset with a demonstrated&#xD;
      ischemic penumbra on perfusion imaging, the administration of P2Y12I in addition to MT and&#xD;
      best medical management (BMM) may increase reperfusion rates and improve functional outcome&#xD;
      compared to MT with BMM alone.&#xD;

    <description>The favorable functional outcome at 3 month will be evaluated using a modified Rankin Scale (mRS). The scale runs from 0 to 6, running from perfect health without symptoms to death (0: no symptoms, 3: Moderate disability. Requires some help, but able to walk unassisted, 6: Dead).</description>

    <description>treated by P2Y12 inhibitor (cangrelor) in addition to MT and BMM. The dose of cangrelor will be started with a 30 micrograms/kg IV bolus over 1 minute right after randomization and before MT. The bolus will be immediately followed with 4 micrograms/kg/min IV infusion for the duration of MT up to 4 hours. Cangrelor infusion will be stopped at the end of the MT procedure and will not go further 4 hours. Transition to oral antiplatelet therapy will be possible 1 hour after cangrelor infusion discontinuation. No other anti-thrombotic drug is authorized during cangrelor infusion. MT technique choice is left to the investigator decision.</description>
