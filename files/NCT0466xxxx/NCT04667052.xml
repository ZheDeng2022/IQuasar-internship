    <measure>Maximum Observed Serum Concentration (Cmax) of JNJ-64304500</measure>

    <description>Cmax is the maximum observed serum concentration.</description>

    <measure>Area Under the Serum Concentration - Time Curve From Time Zero to Time Infinity (AUC [0-infinity]) of JNJ-64304500</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 113</time_frame>
    <description>AUC (0-infinity) is the area under the serum concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity time, calculated as the sum of AUC (0-last) and C(last)/lambda(z); wherein AUC (0-last) is area under the serum concentration-time curve from time zero to last measurable concentration, C(last) is the last observed measurable concentration, and lambda(z) is apparent terminal elimination rate constant.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants with Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 113</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical event that occurs in a participant administered an investigational product, and it does not necessarily indicate only events with clear causal relationship with the relevant investigational product. TEAEs are events between administration of study drug and up to Day 113 that are absent before treatment or that worsen relative to pre-treatment state.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants with Clinically Significant Abnormalities in Vital Signs</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 113</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants with clinically significant vital signs (temperature, pulse/heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure: systolic and diastolic) will be reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants with Clinically Significant Abnormalities in Physical Examinations</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 113</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants with clinically significant abnormalities in the physical examination (includes basic assessment of general appearance, respiratory and cardiovascular systems and the assessment of the skin at the administration area) will be reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants with Clinically Significant Abnormalities in Laboratory Parameters</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 113</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants with clinically significant abnormalities in laboratory assessments like serum chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis will be reported.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants with Serum Antibodies to JNJ-64304500</measure>

             weeks before screening, or will not have fully recovered from illness or surgery, or&#xD;
