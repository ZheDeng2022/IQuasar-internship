    <description>Durable platelet response is defined for naïve participants as the proportion of participants with a platelet count ≥50 × 109/L at ≥50% of scheduled visits, or for participants with baseline platelet count &lt;15 × 109/L, a ≥20 × 109/L increase in platelet count from baseline at ≥50% of scheduled visits, without receiving rescue ITP therapy, as assessed from Week 3 to Week 24.&#xD;
Durable platelet response is defined for participants who previously received sutimlimab as maintenance of platelet count ≥30 × 109/L at ≥50% of scheduled visits, without receiving rescue ITP therapy, as assessed from Week 3 to Week 24.</description>

             sutimlimab in study TDR16218 (NCT03275454), a response to sutimlimab must have been&#xD;
             obtained, as defined by platelet count ≥30 × 10^9/L on 2 visits at least 7 days apart&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For participants who have not previously received sutimlimab: persistent/chronic ITP&#xD;
             (ITP lasting for ≥6 months) and all the following conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Platelet count ≤30 × 10^9/L on 2 occasions at least 5 days apart during the&#xD;
                  Screening Period;&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Lack of an adequate platelet count response (as defined by maintenance of&#xD;
                  sustained platelet count ≥30 × 109/L in the absence of bleeding) to at least 2&#xD;
                  ITP treatments, 1 of which was a thrombopoietin receptor agonist. Other ITP&#xD;
