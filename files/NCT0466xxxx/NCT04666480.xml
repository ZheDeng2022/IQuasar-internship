      An early feasibility study to evaluate the safety and feasibility of the PLAR Implant and&#xD;
      Delivery System to treat severe degenerative mitral regurgitation and to gather preliminary&#xD;
      data on its performance thereby providing guidance for future clinical development. The study&#xD;
      is a single-arm registry with the last follow-up visit at 5 years post-intervention. The&#xD;
      study will enroll up to 10 patients at up to 4 centers in North America.&#xD;

      Percutaneous approaches to treat MR promise to provide a sufficient reduction in MR without&#xD;
      the risks typically associated with open heart surgery. Furthermore there is an unmet&#xD;
      clinical need for patients with severe MR who are refused or denied surgery due to high risk.&#xD;
      Percutaneous therapy provides a novel alternative treatment option for these patients with&#xD;
      the aim of reducing morbidity and mortality over and above current medical therapy. The&#xD;
      Polares Medical PLAR Implant and Delivery System is a catheter-based technology designed to&#xD;
      permanently implant a prosthesis using a transvenous / transseptal approach to augment the&#xD;
      posterior mitral valve leaflet and improve coapatation of the mitral valve. Approved&#xD;
      edge-to-edge repair has already been shown to be a viable alternative for high risk MR&#xD;
      patients. However treatment with these devices is limited to specific anatomies and often&#xD;
      requires multiple devices which increases clinical risk, adds to procedural time, and can&#xD;
      result in residual MR. The PLAR Implant and Delivery System has been designed to overcome and&#xD;
      mitigate some of these shortfalls.&#xD;
