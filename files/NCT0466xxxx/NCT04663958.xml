  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The term postoperative pulmonary complication is the development of any complications&#xD;
      affecting the respiratory system after anesthetic and surgery procedures. The ARISCAT risk&#xD;
      assessment score is a seven-variable regression model that divides patients into low,&#xD;
      moderate, and high-risk groups. In this study, the investigators aimed to investigate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the ARISCAT risk scoring index in predicting postoperative pulmonary&#xD;
      complication development in patients scheduled for major abdominal cancer surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pulmonary complications (PPC) are one of the major causes of postoperative&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. Mortality and morbidity are 14-30% in patients with PPC, while it is&#xD;
      0.2-3% in patients without PPC. Its incidence is variable (&lt;1% to 19%) and is more common&#xD;
      than cardiac complications. Unfortunately, PPCs prolong the hospital stay significantly (up&#xD;
      to 13-17 days), which means postoperative delirium, infection, and cost increase. The causes&#xD;
      of PPCs are varied, and their physiopathology is well explained [3]. However, the rate of&#xD;
      risk identification and scoring is not known. The synergistic effects of the patient's&#xD;
      medical condition, general anesthesia, and surgery type on the respiratory system complicate&#xD;
      the problem.The surgical approach, anesthesia method, and preoperative risk factors of the&#xD;
      patients play an important role in the development of PPC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was conducted after the approval from Dr. Abdurrahman Yurtaslan Oncology SUAM&#xD;
      Ethics Committee in Ankara, Turkey (Between November 2019 - July 2020) (Ethics Committee&#xD;
      Decision No: 2019-11 / 459). After informing all the patients included in the study, verbal&#xD;
      and written consent were obtained. 410 patients over 18 years of age, who were scheduled for&#xD;
      general anesthesia and whose ASA physical score was 1-4, were included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data of the patients, preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis, chronic diseases, ASA&#xD;
      scores, preoperative hemoglobulin values, functional status, history of pulmonary system&#xD;
      disease in the last 30 days, history of smoking and the amount of cigarette consumption,&#xD;
      history of steroid use, chemotherapy and radiotherapy history, anesthesia method, surgical&#xD;
      incision side (lower-upper abdominal), premedication status, intraoperative ventilation&#xD;
      parameters (tidal volume, PEEP, peak pressure, fiO2 ratio), pneumoperitoneum pressure, amount&#xD;
      of colloid / crystalloid product used, erythrocyte suspension and amount used, laparoscopic&#xD;
      or open surgery, emergency or elective surgery, the duration of operation, and postoperative&#xD;
      analgesia method (such as intravenous or epidural patient-controlled analgesia) were&#xD;
      recorded. The ARISCAT risk assessment scores of the patients were also evaluated and recorded&#xD;
      preoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients were followed up in the postoperative care unit. The presence of postoperative&#xD;
      pulmonary complications was evaluated, and the time of discharge was recorded. On the 30th&#xD;
      day after discharge, patients were called and checked their status in terms of mortality.&#xD;
      Postoperative pulmonary complications were defined by the development of one of the following&#xD;
      new findings. The European Perioperative Clinical Outcome Definitions (EPCO) were used for&#xD;
      this definition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These findings; Respiratory Failure, Respiratory infection, Aspiration Pneumonia, Pleural&#xD;
      effusion, Pneumothorax, Atelectasis, Bronchoconstriction, Pneumonia, ARDS, Pulmonary&#xD;
      Embolism, Pulmonary Edema, Unplanned emergency re-intubation, Leaving as intubated from the&#xD;
      operation room.&#xD;
