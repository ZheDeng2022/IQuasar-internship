    <textblock>
      This study is a single-arm, open-label, phase II study of anlotinib combined with radiation&#xD;
      in the treatment of patients with malignant brainstem glioma. Twenty five patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the study who is diagonsis with malignant brainstem glioma. The primary objective&#xD;
      includes disease control rate (DCR), the role of antinib combined with radiotherapy in&#xD;
      improving quality of life and 6-month progression-free survival rate. The secondary objective&#xD;
      include overall survival (OS), toxicity profile. Exploratory objectives include the use of&#xD;
      plasma specimens and cerebrospinal fluid (if possible) to detect biomarkers predicting the&#xD;
      efficacy of anlotinib.&#xD;
