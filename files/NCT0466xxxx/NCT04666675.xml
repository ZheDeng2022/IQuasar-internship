  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atopic Dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that is characterized by&#xD;
      intense itching, oozing and crusting, redness, skin erosion and dry skin. This study will&#xD;
      evaluate how well upadacitinib compared to placebo (no medicine) works to treat participants&#xD;
      with moderate to severe AD in Brazil. The study will assess change in disease signs and&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upadacitinib is an investigational drug being developed for the treatment of Atopic&#xD;
      Dermatitis (AD). This study is &quot;double-blinded&quot;, which means that neither the trial&#xD;
      participants nor the study doctors will know who will be given which study drug. Study&#xD;
      doctors put the participants into 1 of 4 groups called treatment arms. Each group receives a&#xD;
      different treatment. Participants with a diagnosis of AD will be enrolled. Around 150&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled in the study in approximately 20 sites in Brazil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive the following for up to 52 weeks:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive oral upadacitinib tablets once daily for up to week 52.&#xD;
      Participants may also receive oral placebo tablets once daily up to week 16 followed by oral&#xD;
      upadacitinib tablets once daily up to week 52.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1: Upadacitinib Dose A up to week 52. Arm 2: Upadacitinib Dose B up to week 52. Arm 3:&#xD;
      Placebo up to week 16 followed by upadacitinib Dose A up to week 52. Arm 4: Placebo up to&#xD;
      week 16 followed by upadacitinib Dose B up to week 52.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There may be higher burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care.&#xD;
      Participants will attend monthly visits during the course of the study at a hospital or&#xD;
      clinic. The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical assessments, blood tests, and&#xD;
      checking for side effects.&#xD;
