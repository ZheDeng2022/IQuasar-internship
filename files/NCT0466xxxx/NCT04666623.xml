    <textblock>
      This study is to assess the efficacy and safety of a four-week treatment with intranasal&#xD;
      esketamine (56 mg) twice a week combined with opioid analgesic and adjuvant standard therapy&#xD;
      in the management of adult patients with severe and opioid refractory chronic cancer pain.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the eleven point Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 consecutive weeks (from Baseline to week 4)</time_frame>
    <description>Change in the eleven point Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS): assess pain intensity at enrollment and at each visit. Patients will be asked to rate their weekly pain on a scale from 0 to 10 where 0 equals &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 equals &quot;the worst pain they can imagine. NPRS will be taken for both, during physical activity and at rest.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rescue morphine use</measure>
    <time_frame>4 consecutive weeks (from Baseline to week 4)</time_frame>
    <description>The use of morphine rescue (whether it will be reduced, no change, or increased). This will be monitored using either the Aircure artificial intelligence through a mobile application or personal diaries.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 consecutive weeks (from Baseline to week 4)</time_frame>
    <description>Patients' functional status and satisfaction will be measured by the change in Brief Pain Inventory (BPI). (0 = no pain; 10 = pain as bad as you can imagine); No scoring algorithm, but &quot;worst pain&quot; or the arithmetic mean of the four severity items can be used as measures of pain severity; the arithmetic mean of the seven interference items can be used as a measure of pain interference.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 consecutive weeks (from Baseline to week 4)</time_frame>
    <description>Change in depression score using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9) at enrollment and at each visit. It scores each of the nine depression criteria as &quot;0&quot; (not at all) to &quot;3&quot; (nearly every day).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Side Effect Rating Scale for Dissociative Anesthetics (SERSDA)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 consecutive weeks (from Baseline to week 4)</time_frame>
    <description>Change in Side Effect Rating Scale for Dissociative Anesthetics (SERSDA) at enrollment and at each visit. It assesses fatigue, dizziness, headache, nausea, changes in vision and mood changes (0 = side effects absent and 4 = adverse effect is bothersome).</description>

                  and acceptable fashion have failed to reach treatment goals that mainly include&#xD;
                  adequate pain reduction and/or improvement in daily living functioning&#xD;
                  activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients' functional activities do not allow a quality of life which is&#xD;
