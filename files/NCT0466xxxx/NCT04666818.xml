    <textblock>
      Diabetes is the most common metabolic disease complicating pregnancy, and the number of women&#xD;
      in childbearing age facing this problem is rising worldwide. The clinical and social&#xD;
      significance of pre-gestational diabetes has become an important issue in the area of public&#xD;
      health because this disease can cause maternal complications and influence the development of&#xD;
      the offspring during the pregnancy and later in life. Pregnancy in women with pregestational&#xD;
      diabetes is indeed associated with adverse perinatal outcomes including large-for&#xD;
      gestational- age infants (ranging from 48.8 to 62.5%), preterm delivery, and other perinatal&#xD;
      complications. Large-for-gestational-age infants to mothers with diabetes are at increased&#xD;
      risk for birth trauma, transient tachypnea, and neonatal hypoglycemia. For all these reasons,&#xD;
      the medical costs and social burdens caused by this disease are problematic. The mainstay of&#xD;
      managing diabetes during pregnancy is glucose monitoring. Conventionally, glucose monitoring&#xD;
      is by self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) involving multiple pricks to the patients. The&#xD;
      limitations of these pricks include pain and a point-in-time assessment without evaluation of&#xD;
      the complete glycemic profile before making therapeutic adjustments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) by measuring interstitial fluid glucose&#xD;
      has overcome the deficits in SMBG by providing an overview of the glycemic profiles in&#xD;
      patients. In most recent years another promising tool became available: the Flash Glucose&#xD;
      Monitoring (FGM) system. Unlike traditional sensor systems, its wired enzyme sensor is&#xD;
      calibrated in the factory and therefore requires no user calibrations (fingerstick blood&#xD;
      glucose measurements) during the 14 days of wear. Recent studies demonstrated that FGM is&#xD;
      effective in reducing glucose fluctuations and preventing hypoglycemic events in Type 1 and&#xD;
      Type 2 diabetic patients. No evidence is to date available on the efficacy of FGM on the&#xD;
      reduction of the perinatal adverse outcomes during pregnancy in women with pre-gestational&#xD;
      diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to randomize a group of women with poorly controlled pregestational&#xD;
      diabetes to receive SMBG (standard antenatal care) or FGM plus SMBG during pregnancy.&#xD;

      Specific Aims Aim 1: To compare the glycemic control and glucose variability during pregnancy&#xD;
      and at first postpartum visit in the two randomized groups. This was accomplished by the&#xD;
      evaluation of the mean glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels and of several glucose variability&#xD;
      indices during gestation and 1 month after delivery. Hypothesis: the real-time information&#xD;
      provided by the FGM system improves glucose control and glycemic excursions during pregnancy&#xD;
      and after delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To compare the maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes in the two randomized groups at&#xD;
      the time of delivery. This was accomplished by the evaluation of the rate of all the most&#xD;
      important maternal and fetal-neonatal adverse outcomes (e.g. cesarean section, macrosomia,&#xD;
      neonatal hypoglycemia) at the end of gestation. Hypothesis: the use of FGM reduces the rates&#xD;
      of those adverse pregnancy outcomes related to maternal hyperglycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance and Background Pre-gestational diabetes is still associated with adverse&#xD;
      perinatal outcomes largely attributed to maternal hyperglycemia. The risk of adverse outcomes&#xD;
      increases with HbA1c higher than 6-6.5% during gestation. Conversely, mean HbA1c levels &lt;6%&#xD;
      during the second and third trimester are associated with better outcomes and with the lowest&#xD;
      risk of large-forgestational-age infants. Unfortunately, this goal is often difficult to&#xD;
      achieve during pregnancy considering that approximately 60% of all pre-gestational diabetic&#xD;
      women are poorly controlled at the time of conception and that maternal hypoglycemia should&#xD;
      be avoided. Fasting and post-prandial SMBG are recommended in pre-gestational diabetic women&#xD;
      to achieve glycemic control during gestation. Additional useful information on direction,&#xD;
      frequency and duration of glycemic oscillations could be provided by the CGM. This system, in&#xD;
      fact, allows the patients to prevent hypoglycemia and to reduce glucose oscillations&#xD;
      measuring interstitial glucose levels continuously. Despite initial controversial results on&#xD;
      the efficacy of the CGM technology during pregnancy, a recently published trial demonstrated&#xD;
      that Real-Time use of CGM is associated with improved neonatal outcomes (which are likely to&#xD;
      be attributed to reduced exposure to maternal hyperglycemia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately the existing CGM devices still need to be frequently calibrated, using a&#xD;
      minimum of 2-5 daily monitored capillary blood glucose. The recent introduction of FGM using&#xD;
      the factory-calibrated meter has emerged as a novel method to study glycemic patterns. FGM&#xD;
      does not require finger prick calibration. The data are extrapolated using the inbuilt&#xD;
      software to summarize the glycemic variability over 2 weeks. The glucose profile obtained&#xD;
      using this system is called Ambulatory Glucose Profile (AGP). The usefulness of AGP has been&#xD;
      studied in adults and pediatric patients affected by diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, to date there are no studies looking into the efficacy of this tool in women&#xD;
      affected by pre-gestational (Type 1 and Type 2) diabetes during pregnancy. The investigators&#xD;
      aim to evaluate the effectiveness of antenatal FGM on maternal glycemic control and pregnancy&#xD;
      related morbidity in the offspring of mothers with poorly controlled Type 1 and Type 2&#xD;
      diabetes at the time of conception (peri-conception HbA1c â‰¥6.5%).&#xD;

        The investigators carried out a multicenter randomized pilot trial by prospectively&#xD;
        recruiting poorly controlled (peri-conception HbA1c &gt;6.5%) pregestational T1D or T2D&#xD;
        outpatients in 5 Italian Diabetes Medical Centers. Enrolling Centers were selected on the&#xD;
        basis of the experience in following women with pregestational diabetes and on the presence&#xD;
        of the neonatal intensive care unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Randomization was electronically generated at the first pregnancy visit according to a&#xD;
        predefined randomization sequence. Women were assigned to either the control group (CG,&#xD;
        using the standard SMBG at least 6 times daily) or Flash group (FG, using the FGM system&#xD;
        continuously throughout gestation) in a 1:1 ratio.&#xD;
