  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The procedure of puncturing during needle insertion and moving needles within the tissues,&#xD;
      the insertion angle, diameter of needles, and insertion techniques all lead the patient to&#xD;
      experience pain. However, patients tolerate needle insertion more easily when the pain is&#xD;
      managed well. Therefore, pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods are needed in pain&#xD;
      control in order to improve comfort when undergoing hemodialysis (HD), and to facilitate&#xD;
      patient's compliance to treatment over a longer period. Being one of the non-pharmacological&#xD;
      practices, aromatherapy is a part of phototherapy, which means &quot;therapy with plants&quot; and also&#xD;
      aims to manage symptoms such as pain as well as the treatment itself.&#xD;

      Experience of the arteriovenous fistula puncture-related pain can have unpleasant effects on&#xD;
      the patients, it causes that hemodialysis patients experience more disability, depression,&#xD;
      irritability, and insomnia than other patients in adapting to stress. Experiencing continued&#xD;
      pain can also affect the level of hemodialysis acceptance in patients and ultimately decrease&#xD;
      quality of life. Therefore, pain control is an important priority in these patients. In this&#xD;
      regard, in various studies, different pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches have&#xD;
      been used to alleviate the pain.&#xD;
