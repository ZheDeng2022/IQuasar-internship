  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subject of the planned project is the retrospective analysis of routine data of digital&#xD;
      patient files of the Department for Anaesthesiology and Surgical Intensive Care Medicine, to&#xD;
      test whether the predictive values of intensive care scoring systems with regard to&#xD;
      perioperative mortality and morbidity can be improved by continuous score calculation and by&#xD;
      using machine learning and time series analysis methods.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A scoring system usually consists of two parts - a score (a number reflecting the severity of&#xD;
      the disease) and a probability model (equation indicating the probability of an event, e.g.&#xD;
      the death of the patient in hospital). Scoring systems have been used in intensive care&#xD;
      medicine for decades and can help to assess the effectiveness of treatment or identify&#xD;
      comparable patients for study purposes. Scoring systems that are used in intensive care&#xD;
      medicine are for example&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acute Physiology, Age, Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score (MODS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Logistic Organ Dysfunction System (LODS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MPM II-Admission (Mortality Probability Models (MPM II)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Organ Dysfunction and Infection score (ODIN)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Three-Day Recalibrating ICU Outcomes (TRIOS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Glasgow coma score (GCS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Discharge Readiness Score (DRS) The above-mentioned scoring systems are already being&#xD;
           collected regularly in the respective hospital's departments. In a recent study by&#xD;
           Badawi et al. it could be shown that scoring systems allow more accurate predictions&#xD;
           when calculated continuously. However, due to the patient collectives investigated,&#xD;
           these results can only be transferred to other patient groups to a limited extent.&#xD;
           Furthermore, only the scoring systems APACHE, SOFA and DRS were analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, in the present study, all of the above scoring systems will be calculated&#xD;
      continuously (once per minute) using routine data from the digital patient records and&#xD;
      optimized by applying machine learning and methods of time series analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the anesthesiologically managed intensive care units of the respective hospital, there is&#xD;
      no campus-wide standard with regard to alarm management. Accordingly, we estimate the rate of&#xD;
      alarm fatigue (ignoring alarms due to many false alarms) to be very high. In order to&#xD;
      optimize the alarm management, alarms from the patient monitoring devices will be evaluated&#xD;
      retrospectively and combined with the data mentioned above to determine, for example, whether&#xD;
      more frequent alarms are to be expected for certain types of diseases (e.g. sepsis), or&#xD;
      scores (e.g., high APACHE score) and how the alarm limit setting can be optimized.&#xD;
