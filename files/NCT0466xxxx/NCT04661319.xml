  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical practice training often suffers from poor educational efficiency due to the&#xD;
      technical difficulties of the cases, the lack of resources and the cases in the operating&#xD;
      room. The video editing training method is not included in the standard surgical training,&#xD;
      but it has the advantage of reducing trial and error and errors during surgery, simplifying&#xD;
      training time, and cost-effective. Investigators analyzed whether the video editing teaching&#xD;
      method has effective value for trainees compared to the traditional teaching method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of the study is the trainee's learning achievement in terms of surgical&#xD;
      skills. Learning achievement is measured as the difference in pre- and post-educational test&#xD;
      scores (The Global Operative Assessment of Laparoscopic Skills (GOALS)) to compare the&#xD;
      difference in achievement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of the study was to evaluate the satisfaction with the video editing&#xD;
      method as an educational method by conducting a questionnaire survey to all the trainees&#xD;
      participating in the study. In addition, the degree of postoperative pain, postoperative&#xD;
      hospitalization period, postoperative readmission and the need for additional procedures were&#xD;
      compared and analyzed.&#xD;

      1. background Traditional education teaches surgery in a one-on-one apprenticeship of&#xD;
           surgeons and practitioners, in which the surgeon learns to perform surgical operations&#xD;
           under the supervision of a qualified surgeon. The supervisor surgeon instructs the&#xD;
           trainee and, if necessary, temporarily takes over the procedure to show the difficult&#xD;
           steps. Today, a proven educational platform has been established to prevent the risk of&#xD;
           patients being exposed to the early learning curve, allowing trainees to sufficiently&#xD;
           hone their basic skills in open and laparoscopic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Laparoscopic surgery requires complex techniques and techniques that are not used in&#xD;
           open surgery. Laparoscopic instruments provide limited haptic feedback, lack of freedom,&#xD;
           and video monitors that provide a two-dimensional projection of the operating room&#xD;
           impair depth perception, making surgery more difficult. Therefore, surgeons must master&#xD;
           these technical challenges before performing laparoscopic procedures properly and&#xD;
           safely.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Animal model training and cadaver training are very useful, but have the disadvantages&#xD;
           of being small in number and expensive to use. On the other hand, books, the Internet,&#xD;
           and educational videos have the advantage of being able to provide important basic&#xD;
           knowledge about disease and surgical treatment, but the most important factor in&#xD;
           training specific surgical procedures is from the trainee side to the real patient&#xD;
           together with an experienced surgeon Since it is a practical training for Korea, the&#xD;
           teaching method still used is the apprenticeship method. The main drawback of this&#xD;
           traditional approach is that the trainee or supervising surgeon can only perform the&#xD;
           step once per operation. When the supervisor takes over, the memories of training with&#xD;
           the trainee who have to wait for the next task to be performed are lost.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Therefore, investigators devised a new training method called surgical video editing in&#xD;
           order to minimize the frequency of supervisor intervention and maximize the actual&#xD;
           surgical practice time of the trainee. This method is used by the trainee himself to&#xD;
           review the surgical process, Since the essential skills can be recalled and learned, it&#xD;
           can have the effect that the trainee can easily learn the surgery during the actual&#xD;
           surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Target disease : Patients with uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease who are&#xD;
           scheduled operation&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Selection criteria, exclusion criteria, target number of subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. trainees in general surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. No experience of laparoscopic cholecystectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
                  3. Less than 5 experiences of laparoscopic surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
                  4. Uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. Experience with laparoscopic cholecystectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. More than 5 experiences of laparoscopic surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Target number and evidence In the existing literature, it was assumed that the&#xD;
                difference between the video editing group and the control group in the primary&#xD;
                result was 20% or more. This difference was assumed to be a 2-sided confidence&#xD;
                level of 95% with a power of two-sided significance level Î± = 0.2 and power 80%,&#xD;
                and 45 subjects were assigned to each group considering the dropout rate of 10%.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Random allocation schedule and operation Randomization was assigned using block&#xD;
                randomization without stratification, and in order to maintain unpredictability,&#xD;
                which is the basic principle of randomization, the randomization table will be&#xD;
                completed by applying a block size of 2 or 4 or 6. .&#xD;
&#xD;
           The allocation envelope in which the randomization number and allocation group are&#xD;
           recorded is made of opaque material so that it can be blinded, and it is kept sealed&#xD;
           until randomization is performed for each subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The person in charge of the clinical trial or the person in charge of the clinical trial&#xD;
           finally confirms the criteria for exclusion, and if the subject is suitable, assigns a&#xD;
           random assignment number and keeps it in the assignment bag. Afterwards, the study nurse&#xD;
           unseals the assignment bag with the assignment number and conducts D education in the&#xD;
           administration group assigned to the subject according to each random assignment number.&#xD;
           The research nurse must record the release information (release date and release person)&#xD;
           immediately upon release of the sealing of the assignment envelope, and the random&#xD;
           assignment envelope that has already been released can be re-assigned to another subject&#xD;
           even if the subject has withdrawn consent will not be.&#xD;

                          clinical trial finally confirms the criteria for exclusion from&#xD;
                          selection, and if the subject is suitable, assigns a random assignment&#xD;
                          number and keeps it in the assignment bag. After that, the research nurse&#xD;
                          receives the assignment bag with the assignment number and unseals the&#xD;
                          assignment bag to proceed with the training method according to the&#xD;
                          assigned group assigned to the subject according to each random&#xD;

           case record.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In the case that a patient's life-threatening side effect is expressed after surgery,&#xD;
           and the investigator determines that it is necessary to stop&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In case the subject refuses or withdraws consent after the start of the test&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. If it is determined that it is inappropriate as a target patient after starting the test&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. In the case of receiving training that can affect the improvement of surgical skills,&#xD;
           such as other cadeveric practice, without the permission of the test manager after the&#xD;
           start of the test&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. When it is judged that it is impossible to conduct an inspection or investigation after&#xD;
           the start of the test due to the circumstances of the subject&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. In case the test manager determines that it is necessary to stop the test after the&#xD;
           initiation of the test because it is life-threatening or the effect is manifested during&#xD;
           surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8. Effect evaluation criteria, evaluation method and interpretation method (statistical&#xD;
      analysis method)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Analysis of efficacy variables&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Analysis of primary efficacy variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
           : Measured by the difference between the trainee's pre- and post-educational test scores&#xD;
           (The Global Operative Assessment of Laparoscopic Skills, GOALS), and tested using the&#xD;
           student's t-test or wilcoxn's rank sum test according to the satisfaction of the normal&#xD;
           distribution assumption, Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, median,&#xD;
           minimum, maximum) are presented. In addition, the difference between the two groups'&#xD;
           test scores (test group-control group) is presented as the mean and 95% confidence&#xD;
           interval, and it can be confirmed that there was a learning effect when the difference&#xD;
           in test score improvement between the two groups was 20% or more.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Analysis of secondary efficacy variables For categorical variables for hospital stay,&#xD;
           operation time, and complication data obtained as secondary endpoints, n (%) is&#xD;
           presented, and the difference in ratio between the two groups is tested using Chi-square&#xD;
           or Fisher's exact test. In the case of continuous variables, the mean, standard&#xD;
           deviation, median, minimum, and maximum values are presented, and normality tests are&#xD;
           performed to test with Student's t-test for normal distribution, and Wilcoxon rank-sum&#xD;
           test for nonnormal distribution. The investigators will test the difference between the&#xD;
           two groups. For all statistical analysis, SPSS version 21.0 will be used, and those&#xD;
           below the significance level of 0.05 will be judged as statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Analysis target group&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. intention to treat analysis group Randomization is performed only when the&#xD;
                selection criteria described above are met, and all randomized subjects are to be&#xD;
                included in the statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. per protocol analysis group The per protocol analysis group is defined as a trainee&#xD;
                whose training has ended after receiving random assignments and assessed test&#xD;
                scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. How to deal with missing values This study is a prospective study, and it is expected&#xD;
           that there will be no missing values of the primary or secondary endpoints during the&#xD;
           experiment period. However, if missing values occur, the missing values should be&#xD;
           substituted with the average value.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. How to handle compliance Since the intervention applied in this study is an intervention&#xD;
           performed during surgery while the patient is under general anesthesia, there will be no&#xD;
           difference in treatment compliance. In addition, postoperative chest radiography and&#xD;
           pain assessment have been previously included in the clinical pathway of laparoscopic&#xD;
           cholecystectomy, so there is no difference in treatment compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
           9. Safety evaluation criteria including side effects, evaluation methods and reporting&#xD;
           methods In the event of adverse reactions and side effects after surgery, subjects are&#xD;
           educated to report to the researcher, and the occurrence of adverse reactions is checked&#xD;
           and recorded at each visit, and symptoms, time of appearance, duration, degree of&#xD;
           adverse reactions, and causal relationship with test drugs Are recorded in the case&#xD;
           record. In the event of serious adverse reactions or unexpected problems, the lead&#xD;
           researcher should report to the IRB.&#xD;
&#xD;
           10. Rules for compensation for victims Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a safe operation&#xD;
           with extremely low risk of surgery. Also, there are basically no additional risks that&#xD;
           accompany the study. Since antibiotics are drugs that have been used previously, there&#xD;
           is no additional occurrence other than known complications. If participants get an&#xD;
           injury or illness by participating in this study, medical treatment will be provided.&#xD;
           The investigators will provide participants with a quick diagnosis and treatment if&#xD;
           necessary through a referral for consultation with a medical professional related to the&#xD;
           relevant clinical symptoms or signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
           11. preparation for the safety protection of subjects 19.1 Clinical trial agency The&#xD;
           head of the conducting institution shall make every effort to protect the safety of the&#xD;
           subjects by equipping them with the necessary facilities and specialized personnel for&#xD;
           conducting the relevant clinical trial step by step so that the clinical trial can&#xD;
           proceed properly as specified in this study protocol. The person in charge of the&#xD;
           clinical trial must fully understand the side effects and cautions specified in this&#xD;
           plan in advance, and if any serious side effects occur during the study, immediately&#xD;
           stop the clinical trial of the patient, take appropriate measures, and notify the&#xD;
           relevant review committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      19.2 Approval and revision of clinical trial protocol In the case of obtaining approval of a&#xD;
      clinical trial or intending to perform a modified clinical trial, approval is obtained from&#xD;
      the Institutional Review Board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      19.3 Familiarity with the research plan The study manager and the person in charge accurately&#xD;
      analyze and understand the research plan, and actively respond to the subject's problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      19.4 Clinical Trial Consent Before entering the clinical study, after explaining all the&#xD;
      contents and safety of the test to the subject, the subject himself/herself voluntarily&#xD;
      obtains consent to participate in this study and enters the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      19.5 Selecting the correct subject Prior to this study, the suitability of the subject is&#xD;
      thoroughly evaluated. 19.6 Subject's Confidentiality Records that can identify the subject&#xD;
      will be kept confidential, and even if the results of the clinical trial are published, the&#xD;
      subject's identity will be kept confidential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All documents related to clinical trials, such as case records, should be recorded and&#xD;
      classified with the subject identification code (usually the patient's initial), not the&#xD;
      patient name.&#xD;
&#xD;
      19.7 Clinical trial drug management : None. 19.8 Action in case of adverse reaction In the&#xD;
      event of an adverse reaction, it is managed to receive the necessary examination and&#xD;
      treatment from the doctor in charge immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the case of subjects with adverse reactions, the safety of the subjects shall be confirmed&#xD;
      by continuing monitoring for adverse reactions by phone call from the investigator or by&#xD;
      visiting the subject's outpatient clinic until the symptoms are treated, and the duration&#xD;
      shall be recorded in the case record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      12. Other matters necessary to safely and scientifically conduct clinical trials&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Change of clinical trial protocol The purpose of the study, study design, patient&#xD;
           population, number of subjects, and changes to the study protocol, including changes to&#xD;
           the study procedure, and the benefits of the study, or changes to the clinical trial&#xD;
           protocol that may affect the safety of the patient, are not official. The plan needs to&#xD;
           be changed. These changes must be approved by the IRB prior to implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Storage of data The head of the testing institution shall appoint a person in charge of&#xD;
           storage for five years from the date of completion of the clinical trial, unless the&#xD;
           retention period is specifically determined by other laws and regulations among records&#xD;
           and data handed over from the review committee and the research manager. In addition,&#xD;
           measures should be taken to prevent these data from being damaged or lost early due to&#xD;
           accidents, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Researcher's Duties&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Clinical trial records and supporting documents Researchers must preserve all&#xD;
                clinical trial related documents, including all communication related to the study,&#xD;
                patient records, consent, records of use and administration of all clinical trial&#xD;
                drugs, and copies of case records, and ensure that these documents are not damaged&#xD;
                or lost early due to accidents, etc. . However, after the completion of the result&#xD;
                report (if the fact-finding investigation by the head of the Korea Food and Drug&#xD;
                Administration is necessary, the investigation is completed), these documents must&#xD;
                be handed over to the person in charge of storage of a separately determined&#xD;
                testing institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Modification of clinical trial protocol The investigator cannot modify this&#xD;
                clinical trial protocol during the trial without the consent of the other party. If&#xD;
                participants wish to approve a change in the clinical trial protocol, the IRB will&#xD;
                approve the change protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Disclosure of data Individual patient medical information obtained as a result of&#xD;
                this study is considered confidential, and disclosure to third parties is&#xD;
                prohibited except as specified below. However, medical information may be provided&#xD;
                to the patient's individual physician or other appropriate health care provider&#xD;
                responsible for the patient's well-being. Data generated as a result of this study&#xD;
                will be disclosed to the Institutional Review Board or regulatory authority for due&#xD;
                diligence upon request&#xD;
