  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Even though glucocorticoid is the current first line medication for IgG4-RD, it is well&#xD;
      accepted in the field that excessive dosage of GC, especially accumulative dosage, is&#xD;
      associated with increasing organ damage. Although B cell depletion with rituximab has been&#xD;
      verified to be an effective treatment for IgG4-RD, even without concomitant GC therapy,&#xD;
      rituximab can increase the risk of infection during the treatment. Belimumab is an&#xD;
      IgG1-lambda monoclonal antibody that prevents the survival of B lymphocytes by blocking the&#xD;
      binding of soluble human B lymphocyte stimulator protein (BLyS) to receptors on B&#xD;
      lymphocytes. Previous studies and trails suggested that the activity of B-cell mediated&#xD;
      immunity and autoimmune responses were ameliorated after belimumab without increasing rates&#xD;
      of adverse events when compared to standard of care . However, the efficacy and tolerability&#xD;
      of belimumab in IgG4-RD patients have not been examined before. This randomized, control&#xD;
      clinical trial aimed to evaluate the tolerability and the efficacy of Belimumab for&#xD;
      maintenance treatment for IgG4-RD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      IgG4-RD is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality, but there is no established&#xD;
      therapy other than GCs for an acute flare. Up to date, no randomized prospective controlled&#xD;
      studies have been performed for this disease, and no approved therapy is available. Although&#xD;
      GCs are widely and effectively used for treatment of initial disease and flare, they are&#xD;
      associated with substantial toxicity which limits their long-term use. Disease flares also&#xD;
      occur in many patients either during the GC taper or after GC discontinuation. Patients need&#xD;
      a treatment that will more effectively control their disease and avoid GC toxicity. This&#xD;
      study will establish the safety and tolerability of Belimumab in IgG4-RD and its ability to&#xD;
      reduce the risk of disease flares. There are currently no medicinal products approved for the&#xD;
      treatment of IgG4-RD. The majority of cases follow a relapsing course that can lead to&#xD;
      permanent tissue damage with attendant morbidity and potential mortality. Glucocorticoids are&#xD;
      widely and effectively used for treatment of initial disease and of flare, but they do not&#xD;
      prevent recurrence of active disease after their discontinuation and are associated with&#xD;
      substantial toxicity. Patients also continue to relapse on the off-label steroid-sparing&#xD;
      immunosuppressive medications used by some physicians to manage patients with IgG4-RD; thus,&#xD;
      there is a high unmet medical need for more effective therapies in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathogenesis of IgG4-RD suggests that B-cell depletion may be an effective avenue for&#xD;
      therapeutic intervention. Therapeutic depletion of B cells with rituximab reduces&#xD;
      disease-relevant biomarkers and appears to have clinical benefit in uncontrolled,&#xD;
      retrospective and prospective clinical studies. This study aims to define the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of Belimumab for the prevention of flares of this rare disease. In addition, the&#xD;
      potential of Belimumab for minimizing GC exposure could limit the well-known adverse effects&#xD;
      of GCs on bone, skin, muscle, adrenal gland, and eyes, and GC association with weight gain,&#xD;
      diabetes, hypertension, and neuropsychiatric effects.&#xD;
