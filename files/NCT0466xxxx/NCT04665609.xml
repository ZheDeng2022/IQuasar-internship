  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, investigators aimed to evaluated the efficacy and safety of microwave ablation&#xD;
      combined with anlotinib and TQB2450 Solution in patients with advanced hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma. Patients were randomly assigned at a one-to-one ratio to receive microwave&#xD;
      ablation plus anlotinib and TQB2450 Solution or microwave ablation plus TQB2450 Solution.&#xD;
      Primary end points were objective response rate(ORR). Second end points include overall&#xD;
      survival, progression-free survival and disease control rate. Safety was assessed in all&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

    <description>Microwave ablation will be performed according to patients' tumor number, size and liver function. Oral anlotinib (12 mg/d) will be administered and its cycle is defined as 2 weeks on-treatment followed by 1 week off-treatment. Patients will be given 1200 mg TQB245 solution intravenously every 3 weeks. The treatment continues until disease progression or treatment intolerance. Anlotinib and TQB2450 solution will be given after 2 weeks of microwave ablation procedure.</description>
