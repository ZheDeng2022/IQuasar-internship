  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Constipation is a common problem in the general population. Defecation disorders caused by&#xD;
      abnormal contraction or insufficient relaxation of the pelvic floor muscles during defecation&#xD;
      may be one of the most possible causes of constipation. Although constipation is not&#xD;
      life-threatening, it may have a significant impact on the quality of life. Aerobic exercise&#xD;
      has been shown to improve symptoms of constipation in adults with constipation. However,&#xD;
      there is no research investigating the effects of a combined resistance and aerobic training&#xD;
      on pelvic floor symptoms and pelvic floor muscle function in this population and only few&#xD;
      studies have evaluated the pelvic floor muscle function using objective assessment tools&#xD;
      among this population. The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of a combined&#xD;
      resistance and aerobic exercise training program on constipation symptoms and pelvic floor&#xD;
      muscle function in adults with constipation. The investigator will conduct a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of exercise training for adults with&#xD;
      constipation. This study hypothesizes that (1) a combined resistance and aerobic exercise&#xD;
      training can improve pelvic floor symptoms and function in adults with constipation, and (2)&#xD;
      the improvement in combined resistance and aerobic exercise training group will be higher&#xD;
      than that in control group.&#xD;

    <description>The Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptoms questionnaire will be used to assess the severity of constipation symptoms. This questionnaire includes a total of 12 items in 3 subscales: abdominal (4 items), rectal (3 items), and stool (5 items). Participant will be asked to rank the symptoms on a five-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 (absent) to 4 (very severe). The total score ranges from 0 to 48 which will be divided by the actual number of items answered. The higher score indicates the greater severity of constipation symptoms.</description>

    <description>A Seven Day Bowel Diary includes items regarding the frequency of bowel movement, stool consistency, defecation time, excessive straining defecation, using of digital maneuver, and changes in food and liquid consumption.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The pelvic floor muscle coordination measured by the Pelvic Floor Muscle Coordination Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Pelvic Floor Muscle Coordination Scale including 5 items, respiration, pelvic floor muscle contraction, extrapelvic muscle activation, pelvic floor muscle expansion, and cough will be used to evaluate pelvic floor muscle coordination. All will be evaluated by observation. The total score ranges from 0 to 10 and a higher score indicates the poorer pelvic floor muscle coordination.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The pelvic floor muscle strength will be measured by digital rectal examination.</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Resting tone, maximal voluntary contraction of external anal sphincter and puborectalis, voluntary relaxation and straining will be measured and scored using the International Continence Society scale.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The pelvic floor muscle function will be measured using anorectal manometry.</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to relax for 10 seconds, squeeze 3 times by holding 5 seconds with 5 seconds of rest in between, and squeeze by holding the contraction for 30 seconds. Anorectal pressure will be recorded in unit of centimeter of water.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical activity levels</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The International Physical Activity Questionnaire will be used to measure participants' physical activity levels. This questionnaire includes seven questions on different physical activity levels of duration and frequency and then calculated in metabolic equivalent-minutes/week. A higher score indicates a greater physical activity levels.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Constipation quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patient Assessment of Constipation Quality of Life Questionnaire will be used to evaluate the quality of life in constipation patients. This questionnaire includes a total of 28 items in 4 subscales: worries and concerns (11 items), physical discomfort (4 items), psychosocial discomfort (8 items), and satisfaction (5 items). Participants will be asked to rank the symptoms on a five-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 to 4. A higher score indicates greater impact on quality of life.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to record the number of completed home exercise in the exercise diary. It will be calculated as the adherence rate of home program.</description>

After baseline assessment, the participants will receive health and lifestyle advices related to bowel symptoms, which include maintaining moderate physical activity, healthy diet, and ideal defecation posture, and establishing a personal bowel schedule and other behavioral changes that promote regular bowel movements.&#xD;
Upon request, the participants will be provided with the same intervention program as the exercise training group after 8 weeks participation.</description>

    <description>A supervised moderate-intensity exercise training session, which will include aerobic exercise with a stationary exercise bike, resistance exercise using dumbbell, theraband band, or gym ball for each major muscle groups and core muscles (including pelvic floor muscle (PFM) training with biofeedback), and stretching exercise, twice a week for 8 weeks. All exercises will be individualized based on participant's heart rate reserve and Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE). An oximeter and a sphygmomanometer will be used to monitor the heart rate, oxygen saturation and blood pressure of the participants to ensure safety.&#xD;
