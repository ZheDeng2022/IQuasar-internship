  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Because advanced gastric cancer shows poor prognosis, it is important to detect early gastric&#xD;
      cancer or precancerous gastric adenoma patients who have a cure rate of 95% or more.&#xD;
      Moreover, a large part of early gastric cancer can be completely resected by endoscopic&#xD;
      resection, thus ensuring a very high quality of life for patients. However, there are&#xD;
      currently no markers that can be used for diagnosis of early gastric cancer or gastric&#xD;
      adenoma. In addition, the biggest problem after endoscopic resection of early gastric cancer&#xD;
      is metachronous recurrence of the cancer, which requires repeated endoscopic resection or&#xD;
      additional surgical gastrectomy. However, there are no discovered markers for prediction of&#xD;
      recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liquid biopsy is a method of obtaining body fluids such as gastric juice or effusion through&#xD;
      an endoscopic inlet during gastroscopy or colonoscopy and blood. Based on the advanced&#xD;
      analysis method, liquid biopsy reveals more genetic information than tissue biopsy.&#xD;
      Therefore, it is highly likely to become an essential factor in future personalized medicine.&#xD;
      Therefore, this study was designed to identify whether tumor's molercular profiling based on&#xD;
      tissue or blood could be used for prediction of prognosis and diagnosis of early gastric&#xD;
      cancer and precancerous gastric adenoma.&#xD;

      1. Acquisition of tumor samples : Tissue and 10ml of blood will be collected for genomic&#xD;
           examination of those histologically diagnosed with early gastric cancer or precancerous&#xD;
           gastric adenoma lesion, and additional tissue and blood will be collected at 2 months, 1&#xD;
           year after treatment, and recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Suitability of tmor samples&#xD;
&#xD;
           : Tumor areas (&gt; 60%) are dissected under microscopy from 4-μm-thick unstained sections&#xD;
           by comparison with an H&amp;E stained slide, and genomic DNA was extracted using a Qiagen&#xD;
           DNA FFPE Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's&#xD;
           instructions. After extraction, we measured concentrations and 260/280 and 260/230 nm&#xD;
           ratios using a spectrophotometer (ND1000, Nanodrop Technologies, ThermoFisher&#xD;
           Scientific, MA, USA). Each sample was then quantified with an Qubit fluorometer (Life&#xD;
           Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Samples of genomic DNA with more than 10 ng measured&#xD;
           by the Qubit fluorometer were subjected to AmpliSeq library preparation. To identify&#xD;
           &quot;druggable&quot; CNVs, we used a 21-gene nCounter CNV assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Method of tumor molecular profiling&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Ion Torrent PGM Amplieq Cancer Panel 2.0 : We use the Ion AmpliSep Cancer Panel&#xD;
                V2(Ion Torrent) to detect frequent somatic mutations that were selected based on&#xD;
                literature review. It examines 285 mutations in 50 commonly mutated oncogenes and&#xD;
                tumor supressor genes. First, 10ng of DNA from each 89 FFPE tumor samples underwent&#xD;
                single-tube, multiplex PCR amplication using the Ion AmpliSepCancer Primer Pool and&#xD;
                the AmpliSepKit reagents (Life Technologies).Treatment of the resulting amplicons&#xD;
                with FuPa Preagent partially digest the primers and phosphorylate the amplicons.&#xD;
                The phosphorylate the amplicons are ligated to Ion dapters and purfied. For&#xD;
                barcoded library preparation, we substitite barcoded adapters from the Ion XpressTM&#xD;
                Library Kit. The ligated DNA undergose nick translation and amplication to complete&#xD;
                the linkage between adapters and amplicons and to generate sufficient material for&#xD;
                dowmstream template treparation. Two rounds of Agencourt® AMPure® XP Reagent&#xD;
                binding at 0.6 and 1.2 bead- to- sample volum ratios removed input DNA and&#xD;
                unincorporated primers form the amplicons. The final library molecules are&#xD;
                125-300bp in size. We then transfer the libries to the Ion OneTouchTM system for&#xD;
                automated template preparation. Sequencing is performed on the Ion PGMTM sequencer&#xD;
                according to the manufacturer's instructions. We use IonTorrent Software for&#xD;
                automated data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  nCounter copy Number Variation CodeSets : We custom designed a 21-gene CNV assay as&#xD;
                outlined in a previous study. The 21 genes included AURAKA, CCND1, CCNE1, CDK4,&#xD;
                CDK6, CDNK1A, CDNK2A, EGFR, ERBB2, ERBB3, FGFR1, FGFR2, IGFR1R, KLF5, KRAS, MDM2,&#xD;
                MET, MITF, MYC, PIK3CA, and TNIK. For detection of CNVs, nCounter Copy Number&#xD;
                Variation CodeSets were used with 200 ng purified genomic DNA. DNA was fragmented&#xD;
                via AluI digestion and denatured at 95°C. Fragmented DNA was hybridized with the&#xD;
                codeset of 21 genes in the nCounter Cancer CN Assay Kit (Nanostring Technologies)&#xD;
                for 18 h at 65°C and processed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The&#xD;
                nCounter Digital Analyzer counted and tabulated the signals of reporter probes.&#xD;
                Quantified data were analyzed using NanoString's nSolver Analysis Software.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Immunohistochemistry&#xD;
&#xD;
                : RET, ATM, PD-L1, FGFR2, MLH, EGFR, ALK, ROS, TRKA. MET, HER2, PTEN loss&#xD;
                (EGFR,CCNEI in selected cases)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cancer Scan&#xD;
&#xD;
                : targeted deep sequencing at Samsung Genome Institute&#xD;
&#xD;
                : Illumina HiSeq2000/2500-based, MiSeq NGS targeted sequencing&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  ASFA™ Spotter&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Statistics : Analysis of genetic research is primarily technical. Data are presented&#xD;
           using summary statistics tables and graphs. The total disease-free survival period is&#xD;
           calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method through medical records of subjects who have&#xD;
           undergone endoscopic resection.&#xD;

      Tissue and blood will be collected as follows from patients with early gastric cancer or&#xD;
      precancerous gastric adenoma that satisfy the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Tissue will&#xD;
      be collected through biopsy/endoscopic removal peformed prior to participation in this study.&#xD;
      Biopsies will not be performed simply for research purposes. If a biopsy is performed during&#xD;
      the follow-up process after treatment, relevant samples will be stored if an appropriate&#xD;
      amount of the sample remains after the biopsy.&#xD;

        A total of 1730 patients with early gastric cancer and precancerous gastric adenoma will be&#xD;
        enrolled. Based on previous studies, approximately 20% of the subjects are expected to have&#xD;
        mutations. In this study, metachronous tumor recurrence rate between the mutation group and&#xD;
        non-mutation group will be compared. In general, metachronous tumor recurrent rate after&#xD;
        endoscopic resection for early gastric cancer or gastric ademona is reported to be 6%-10%.&#xD;
        In this study, the metachronous tumor recurrence rate is expected to be 10% and 5% in the&#xD;
        mutation and non-mutation group, respectively. When a two-sided chi-square test with a&#xD;
        power of 5% and 90% type 1 error is performed, 346 and 1384 subjected are expected to be&#xD;
        included in the mutation group and non-mutation group, respectively.&#xD;
