    <textblock>
      This is a single arm and open-label phase I trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      efficacy of the oncolytic virus M1 （M1-c6v1）(iv 1×109 CCIC50, 1 dose per day, on day 1-5 each&#xD;
      28 day cycle) combined with anti-PD-1 antibody SHR-1201 (iv, 200 mg, once every two weeks)&#xD;
      and Apatinib (po. 250 mg qd ) in the patients with advanced/metastatic hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma. 10 participants will be sequentially enrolled. The treatment duration is 12&#xD;
      months. All patients continue combination treatment until disease progression, unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity, death, or discontinuation for any reason.&#xD;
