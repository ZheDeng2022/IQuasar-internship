  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This two-group, parallel randomized controlled study was conducted to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      the training program provided to primipara pregnant women through the motivational interview&#xD;
      method on their fear of childbirth, childbirth self-efficacy and delivery mode. The primipara&#xD;
      pregnant women included in the study sample were assigned to the intervention (n=37) and&#xD;
      control (n=36) groups using the block randomization method. The women in the intervention&#xD;
      group were individually provided with &quot;Training Program on Fear of Childbirth Based on&#xD;
      Motivational Interview Method&quot; once a week, four sessions in total, while no interventions&#xD;
      were made for those in the control group other than routine hospital practices. Study data&#xD;
      were collected using a descriptive information form, the Wijma Delivery Expectancy/Experience&#xD;
      Questionnaire (W-DEQ) versions A-B, the Childbirth Self-Efficacy Inventory-Short Form&#xD;
      (CBSEI-SF) and the Delivery Evaluation Form. The value of p&lt;0.05 was accepted statistically&#xD;
      significant in the data analyses.&#xD;

    <measure>Wijma Delivery Expectancy/Experience Questionnaire (W-DEQ) A version</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from the WDEQ A scores at pre-training (24th and 28th gestational week), post-training (4 weeks later) and 37th and 40th gestational week</time_frame>
    <description>W-DEQ Version A, which was developed in Sweden in 1998 by Wijma and Klaas, was adapted into Turkish by Körükçü et al. in 2009. It is a 6-point Likert type scale and consists of 33 items. The answers in the scale are scored from 0 to 5, with 0 indicating &quot;completely&quot; and 5 indicating &quot;none.&quot; The minimum score on the scale is 0, whereas the maximum score is 165. A high total score indicates a high level of fear; 85 points are considered as the cut-off value. A score of ≥85 indicates clinical level fear.</description>

    <measure>Childbirth Self-Efficacy Inventory-Short Form (CBSEI-SF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from the CBSEI-SF scores at pre-training (24th and 28th gestational week), post-training (4 weeks later) and 37th and 40th gestational week</time_frame>
    <description>The short form of the Childbirth Self-efficacy Inventory has two subscales: outcome expectancy and efficacy expectancy (Ip, et al., 2008). Efficacy expectancy (EE) is a personal conviction about one's ability to successfully perform the required behaviors in a given situation, and outcome expectancy (OE) is the belief that a given behavior will lead to a given outcome. Each subscale consists of 16 items and yields a score between 16 and 160. Higher scores indicate higher levels of efficacy or outcome efficacy for birth.</description>

    <measure>The Wijma Delivery Expectancy/Experience Questionnaire (W-DEQ) B version</measure>
    <time_frame>W-DEQ-B scores at postpartum first day</time_frame>
    <description>The W-DEQ-B was created by Wijma and et al. to evaluate intrapartum childbirth fear in the postpartum period. The validity and reliability study of the scale was conducted by Körükçü et al. It is composed of 32 items. It uses a 6-point Likert scale: 0 corresponds to completely, and 5 corresponds to never. The lowest and the highest scores for the scale are 0 and 160, respectively.</description>
