  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the past 10 years, electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes, EC) have been commercialized as&#xD;
      a &quot;less harmful&quot; alternative to traditional cigarettes.1,2 However, e-cigarettes are believed&#xD;
      to cause pulmonary epithelial, endothelial and vascular dysfunction, and to cause murine&#xD;
      phenotypes similar to those of human COPD. Recently, &quot;spiked&quot; vape juice has been linked to&#xD;
      severe lung damage. Unfortunately, the effects of e-cigarettes on the human lungs are still&#xD;
      poorly understood, especially in healthy young adults. Therefore, establishing the health&#xD;
      effects of e-cigarettes in humans is of paramount importance to guide medical and regulatory&#xD;
      decision making. Its widespread use and immense popularity among teenagers and young adults&#xD;
      have caused major concern given potentially significant addictive and detrimental long-term&#xD;
      health effects.&#xD;

      This exploratory proposal will exploit 3D hyperpolarized xenon-129 MRI (HXeMRI), an imaging&#xD;
      tool that our research group has pioneered, to address this urgent need. The HXeMRI technique&#xD;
      has unique abilities to quantify regional ventilation (airflow), and gas uptake by tissue&#xD;
      (interstitium), and blood (pulmonary vasculature) in the human lung with high spatial&#xD;
      resolution. HXeMRI is anticipated to overcome the limitations of PFT and MDCT. Because HXeMRI&#xD;
      images are acquired in a single breath-hold, pixel-based ratio maps can quantify xenon&#xD;
      movement crossing from airways to tissue and finally to RBCs. The calculated ratios are&#xD;
      closely related to important lung physiological factors: Tissue-to-Gas ratio (T/G) reflects&#xD;
      tissue integrity and alveolar surface-to-volume ratio; RBC-to-Gas ratio (R/G) reflects&#xD;
      overall gas exchange efficiency from the airspaces to the blood, and RBC-to-Tissue ratio&#xD;
      (R/T) reflects capillary perfusion and gas-blood barrier functional integrity. The&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity of these parameters have been shown to be highly relevant in&#xD;
      clinical arenas. For example, decreases in gas uptake by tissue and blood are consistently&#xD;
      found in COPD and interstitial lung disease. Alteration of gas exchange measured by&#xD;
      RBC-to-tissue ratio in COPD and asthma is associated with changes in the alveolar septal wall&#xD;
      and capillary perfusion. Investigators have found regionally heterogeneous tissue gas uptake&#xD;
      and impairment of gas exchange in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. This actively-funded NIH&#xD;
      study has found highly heterogeneous airway obstruction and alterations of gas exchange in&#xD;
      patients with cystic fibrosis that are routinely undetectable by clinical PFT. These results&#xD;
      demonstrate the unique advantages of HXeMRI to quantitatively assess comprehensive regional&#xD;
      physiology of microscopic pulmonary compartments.&#xD;

During Visit 2, changes in health since Visit 1 will be assessed. In addition, the following will be done in accordance with the parent protocol:&#xD;
The standard MR compatibility screening form will be completed.&#xD;
Spirometry will be performed before and after MR imaging.&#xD;
A limited physical exam&#xD;
Female subjects who could be pregnant will take a urine pregnancy test prior to imaging.&#xD;
