  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, when patients diagnosed with AN started treatment and their weight increased&#xD;
      by 10%; On the other hand, it was aimed to compare the changes in serum adipokine levels&#xD;
      observed in morbidly obese patients before bariatric surgery and when they lost 10% of their&#xD;
      post-op weight with both anthropometric measurements, biochemical parameters, and values of&#xD;
      healthy volunteers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The most characteristic feature of obesity is the increase in adipose tissue. On the&#xD;
      contrary, in anorexia nervosa, there is a decrease in adipose tissue enough to impair&#xD;
      neuroendocrine functions. Adipose tissue is formed by loosely binding lipid-filled cells&#xD;
      called adipocytes and is now considered an important part of energy metabolism. Adipokines it&#xD;
      secretes play a role in many physiological processes of the body such as nutrition, appetite,&#xD;
      energy balance, insulin, and glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, regulation of blood&#xD;
      pressure, vascular remodeling, coagulation, and inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, changes in the amount of body fat in these two patient groups, which are at the&#xD;
      two ends of the spectrum, affect both the biochemical parameters and physiological functions&#xD;
      of the patients in different ways. It is expected that both adipokine levels and biochemical&#xD;
      parameters will approach the values of healthy subjects with a decrease in adipose tissue of&#xD;
      clinically morbidly obese patients and an increase in adipose tissue of patients with AN.&#xD;
      However, in some studies comparing the parameters of patients with constitutionally weak&#xD;
      patients and patients with AN, results contrary to expectations were obtained. In this study,&#xD;
      we compared the extent to which weight changes changed adipokines and correlated with&#xD;
      biochemical parameters based on healthy and normal-weight volunteers.&#xD;
