  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The diagnoses processes of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) focus on the following four&#xD;
      main types of diagnoses methods consisting of inspection, olfaction, inquiry, and palpation.&#xD;
      The most important one is palpation also called pulse diagnosis which is to measure wrist&#xD;
      artery pulse by TCM doctor's fingers to detect patient's health state. The pulse diagnosis&#xD;
      has three parts, namely 'Chun', 'Guan' and 'Chy', with the location. Wrist measurements&#xD;
      correspond to different parts of the body's organs. However, the pulse information is&#xD;
      analyzed by TCM doctor's pulse diagnoses process, which is picked only a single waveform from&#xD;
      a long-term pulse measured process and often discarded the other waveforms contained in the&#xD;
      same information, e.g. Slip Pulse waveform. The research object of this project is to divide&#xD;
      the TCM diagnosis patients into two groups, one is the Slip pulse group and the other is a&#xD;
      Flat Pulse group, in which the cases are collected at least 50 cases for the first gruop and&#xD;
      30 cases for the second group, individually. The purpose of this project will integrate the&#xD;
      TCM doctor's experiences and standardize them in order to construct an effective Slip pulse&#xD;
      diagnosis system based on visualization engineering platform. It could refine Slip pulse&#xD;
      diagnoses processes and reduce their diagnoses loading by using the proposed approach during&#xD;
      this project. Therefore, we will propose a similar Moiré feature analyzing approach based on&#xD;
      Recurrent Neural Network to process the measured Slip Pulse wave-images with 'Chun', 'Guan'&#xD;
      and 'Chy' in order to prepare this visualization engineering platform. We will measure the&#xD;
      waveform images of the three parts of the wrist as 'Chun', 'Guan' and 'Chy' with the moiré&#xD;
      feature technology proposed in this project. It mainly extracts the moiré features such as&#xD;
      pulse image from numerous measurement 'Chun', 'Guan' and 'Chy' signals, and further analyzes&#xD;
      and summarizes them with AI technology. We could extract the pulse characteristics of Slip&#xD;
      pulse automatically from the many measurement signals and enhance the automatic judging&#xD;
      ability of the current pulse instrument to the Slip pulse waveform. Provide important pulse&#xD;
      information to the TCM doctors as an important reference for precision clinical diagnoses.&#xD;
