  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite evidence for ICBT among those with other chronic conditions, its efficacy has yet to&#xD;
      be evaluated among those with neurological conditions, including stroke. The aim of the&#xD;
      current study is to pilot a tailored ICBT program developed through a patient oriented&#xD;
      approach to improve overall wellbeing among those with stroke living in the community.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Individuals with stroke can experience high levels of emotional distress leading&#xD;
      to decreased quality of life and increased health care costs. Though mental health problems&#xD;
      are prevalent and disabling, they often go untreated for various reasons, such as access to&#xD;
      specialized care, rural and remote location, lack of time, or concerns about stigma related&#xD;
      to seeking care. Internet delivered cognitive behaviour therapy (ICBT) overcomes barriers to&#xD;
      face-to-face therapy by often reaching a much wider group of patients who experience unequal&#xD;
      access to health care. The internet based program is based on cognitive behaviour therapy,&#xD;
      which is an evidenced-based treatment that helps patients identify and modify thoughts and&#xD;
      behaviours that contribute to their mental health concerns. ICBT has been shown to be&#xD;
      effective in improving psychosocial outcomes such as depression and anxiety, along with&#xD;
      disability and quality of life among persons with chronic health conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: Despite evidence for ICBT among those with other chronic conditions, its efficacy&#xD;
      has yet to be evaluated among those with neurological conditions, including stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The aim of the current study is to pilot an ICBT program developed through a&#xD;
      patient oriented approach to improve overall wellbeing among those with stroke&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: In this project, an ICBT program for those with stroke developed through a patient&#xD;
      oriented approach will be piloted amongst a small group of participants (n=20) to examine&#xD;
      acceptability, feasibility, and limited efficacy. At the end of the program, participants&#xD;
      will be asked to complete a brief semi-structured interview examining barriers and&#xD;
      facilitators to the ICBT program. Participant feedback from the interviews will be used to&#xD;
      further improve the ICBT program to meet the needs of the population. The results from the&#xD;
      study will be used to guide larger studies to evaluate effectiveness of the program in a&#xD;
      community setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated Impact: Ultimately, the proposed project aims to improve overall wellbeing and&#xD;
      access to health care service for those who have experienced stroke and mental health&#xD;
      concerns.&#xD;

    <description>CBT provides online structured self-help modules over several months based on the principles of CBT in combination with weekly guidance through emails and telephone calls. The course comprises 6 online lessons that provide psychoeducation about: 1) symptom identification and the cognitive behavioural model; 2) thought monitoring and challenging; 3) de-arousal strategies and pleasant activity scheduling; 4) graduated exposure/pacing; 5) memory and attention; and 6) relapse prevention. Participants will also have the opportunity to ask any questions regarding the content of the program materials and will receive a response from their Guide within 48-72 hours. Guide will spend ~15 mins. per week/per participant. All Guides have completed a university program (psychology or social work) and are registered clinicians or students working under supervision of a registered clinician.</description>
