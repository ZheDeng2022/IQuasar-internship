  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite significant evolution of cancer therapies from the early 20th century, these&#xD;
      therapies are still associated with toxic effects that negatively impact the patient's&#xD;
      performance status, quality of life and survival. The role of physical activity to counteract&#xD;
      these side effects is acknowledged. However, cancer patients are often misinformed about the&#xD;
      potential benefits of physical therapy during cancer therapy. In this context, the role of&#xD;
      therapeutic patient education seems essential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of lack of time, therapeutic patient education (TPE) is often provided via an&#xD;
      information booklet. However, the investigators assume that a face-to-face interview results&#xD;
      in a greater impact on patient's behavior change (the level of physical activity during&#xD;
      cancer therapy, in our case). This research project is designed to challenge this hypothesis.&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that a brief oral educational session of 30 minutes provided at&#xD;
      the very beginning of cancer therapy will enhance the physical activity level of our patients&#xD;
      for at least 6 months, i.e. during their cancer therapy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to compare the effects of two forms of TPE on the patient's PA level.&#xD;
      In one of the two forms, TPE is delivered using an information booklet accompanied with a&#xD;
      semi-structured oral interview (intervention group), whereas in the other form TPE is only&#xD;
      delivered via the booklet (control group). The investigators hypothesize that the brief oral&#xD;
      educational session of 30 minutes provided at the very beginning of cancer therapy will&#xD;
      enhance the PA level of our patients for at least 6 months, i.e. during their cancer therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed as a double-blind randomized controlled trial. The primary outcome is&#xD;
      the evolution in each group of the PA level (via the international physical activity&#xD;
      questionnaire (IPAQ) - long form) between the start of cancer therapy and 6-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be randomly assigned either to the intervention group (TPE includes&#xD;
      the information booklet + the semi-structured oral intervention provided by a&#xD;
      physiotherapist) or to the control group (TPE will consist only in the information booklet).&#xD;
      Patients and assessors will be blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relative efficacy of these 2 treatment arms will be evaluated at baseline, after 3 months&#xD;
      at a visit for a follow-up medical consultation set by the oncologist, and after 6 months at&#xD;
      a second follow-up consultation.&#xD;

    <description>Fatigue is measured via the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Fatigue scale (FACIT-F).&#xD;
The scale is a 40-item measure that assesses self-reported fatigue and its impact upon daily activities and function.&#xD;
The total score range from 0 to 160. The lower the score, the higher the fatigue.</description>

    <measure>Changes in quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, 3 months and 6 months after the start of the cancer therapy</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life is measured via the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality of life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30).&#xD;
The QLQ-C30 is composed of both multi-item scales and single-item measures. There are 30 items. These include five functional scales, three symptom scales, a global health status / QoL scale, and six single items. All single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100.&#xD;
A high score for a functional scale represents a high / healthy level of functioning, A high score for the global health status / QoL represents a high QoL, A high score for a symptom scale / item represents a high level of symptomatology / problems.</description>
