  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With its high incidence rate and low diagnosis rate, vestibular migraine (VM) can seriously&#xD;
      affect patients' quality of life. Current treatment of VM mainly contain rescue treatment and&#xD;
      prophylaxis, both of which are often pharmacological-based therapies and bring a series of&#xD;
      unavoidable side effects, which leads to poor compliance of patients. Moreover, frequent VM&#xD;
      attacks can seriously affect patients' daily life and work. Therefore, prophylaxis treatment&#xD;
      is of great significance for VM patients. As a non-pharmarceutical therapy, acupuncture is&#xD;
      widely used for a wide range of migrainous and emotional disorders. Thus, it might be an&#xD;
      alternative treatment for VM, but current evidence remains inconclusive. The aim of this&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial is to investigate the prophylactic efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      acupuncture therapy in patients with VM.&#xD;

      This randomized controlled trial will enroll patients with vestibular migraine from the First&#xD;
      Affiliated Hospital of Jiaxing University. All participants will be randomly assigned to two&#xD;
      groups. Participants will receive acupuncture in the treatment group, while participants in&#xD;
      the control group will be treated by venlafaxine. All treatments will be given for 8 weeks.&#xD;
      The primary outcome measures are change in vertigo/migraine days and vertigo/migraine&#xD;
      attacks, vertigo severity, and migraine intensity per 4 weeks from baseline. The secondary&#xD;
      outcome measures are change in dosage of rescue medication, anxiety level，depression&#xD;
      level，and quality of life per 4 weeks from baseline.&#xD;

    <description>Patients in this group will receive acupuncture once every other day (3 days per week) over an 8-week period (a total of 24 sessions). In each session, needles will be retained for 30 minutes. The acupoints will include Baihui (DU20), Qianding (DU21), Houding (DU19), Yintang (DU29), Fengchi (GB20), Shuaigu (GB8), Tongli (HT5), Hegu (LI4), Taichong (LR3), Fenglong (ST40), Xuanzhong (GB39) and Zulinqi (GB41). The selection of acupoints is on the basis of meridian theory and patients' clinical symptoms.&#xD;
Patients are not allowed to take prophylactic medications. But in case of intolerable acute VM attacks, the patients will be instructed to take triptans as rescue medication, and the dosage of medication will be documented in the patient diary.</description>
