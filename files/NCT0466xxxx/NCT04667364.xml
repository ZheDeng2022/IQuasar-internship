    <textblock>
      CRPS is a complex pain condition that usually develops in response to trauma and&#xD;
      immobilization which is very painful and debilitating. There is no consensus about the&#xD;
      underlying mechanisms which might be a combination of mentally and physically factors. At the&#xD;
      moment, better diagnostic clarification and better pain relieving treatment is needed. The&#xD;
      aim of this study is to investigate changes in the perception of pain in patients with&#xD;
      Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS), and whether this perception can be affected by&#xD;
      treatment with transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) on the painful area. The&#xD;
      study will consist of two parts. One in which patients' perception of pain will be compared&#xD;
      to the perception of pain in healthy controls. Another in which the included patients are&#xD;
      randomly allocated into a group receiving medical treatment plus treatment with&#xD;
      transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation on the painful area or in a group receiving&#xD;
      medical treatment as usual (MED).Patients will be evaluated four times. At the start of the&#xD;
      study, immediately after treatment, and again at 6 and 12 months after treatment. The&#xD;
      evaluation consists of an overall assessment of pain, response to standardized sensory&#xD;
      stimuli, and questionnaires about quality of life, physical capacity and mentally/socially&#xD;
      well-being.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND Chronic pain represents a major challenge worldwide, with significant clinical,&#xD;
      social and economic implications. Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a chronic pain&#xD;
      condition that usually, but not exclusively, develops in response to acute trauma or surgery.&#xD;
      It is characterized by pain disproportionate to the preceding trauma, in addition to sensory&#xD;
      abnormalities and autonomic disturbances, trophic changes and impaired motor function.&#xD;
      Reports indicate that the incidence of CRPS is 26.2/100.000 life-years, with a 3.5:1 female&#xD;
      male ratio, and with a mean age at diagnosis 52.7y. The condition is complex and is probably&#xD;
      the result of multimodal pathogenesis, that has a significant impact on daily functioning and&#xD;
      quality of life (QoL). In addition, few cases resolve completely within 12 months of onset,&#xD;
      has a large impact on work ability and some develop chronic pain and disability. The&#xD;
      socioeconomic consequences are therefore substantial and an increased focus on CRPS diagnosis&#xD;
      and treatment is needed. Because of the complexity of the condition, treatment is difficult&#xD;
      and include physiotherapy, education, spinal cord stimulation (SCS) and medical treatment.&#xD;
      Primary treatment involves medical treatment which might include important adverse effects&#xD;
      such as fatigue, insomnia, anxiety and weight gain, to name a few. Regardless, results vary&#xD;
      significantly. One explanation is the multimodality of pain that involves both peripheral&#xD;
      nerves, the spinal cord and higher brain centers, modulated by immune cells, interneurons,&#xD;
      descending pathways, cognitive and psychosocial factors. Changes in pain sensitization has&#xD;
      been proposed to be a driving factor in CRPS and is the result of distorted somatosensory&#xD;
      signaling in the central nervous system. Pain normally reflects damaging peripheral input,&#xD;
      acting as an important protective function, however, this concept might get distorted so that&#xD;
      pain no longer represent peripheral noxious stimuli but rather functional changes of the&#xD;
      central nervous system. The pain in these situations arises spontaneously, can be elicited by&#xD;
      normally innocuous stimuli (allodynia), is exaggerated and prolonged in response to noxious&#xD;
      stimuli (hyperalgesia), and spreads beyond the site of injury (secondary hyperalgesia).&#xD;
      Testing some of the underlying mechanisms provides the means to directly evaluate these pain&#xD;
      symptoms suggested to be among the primary complaints in CPRS. Accordingly, a range of&#xD;
      sensory changes has been suggested including thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia and&#xD;
      hypoesthesia. A study found hyperalgesia to blunt pressure in patients with CRPS and with&#xD;
      peripheral nerve injury, which has been confirmed by others, suggesting an importance of deep&#xD;
      somatic structures such as muscles and bones. Another study showed changes in thermal&#xD;
      sensitivity with both heat and cold hyperalgesia in the acute phase of CRPS and a modulation&#xD;
      of thermal detection thresholds as the CRPS progressed. In addition, a study reported changes&#xD;
      in endogenous pain modulation, implying a shift towards facilitation, whereas others found&#xD;
      limited change. These differential results alongside heterogeneous mechanisms associated with&#xD;
      diverse clinical features complicates treatment significantly which might only affect a small&#xD;
      portion of patients. It is crucial to establish whether patients can be identified and&#xD;
      distinguished to facilitate optimal decisions and effects of treatment strategies. This&#xD;
      project applies a psychophysical method, based on conventional quantitative sensory testing&#xD;
      (QST), to quantify somatosensory function in CRPS patients, to provide a mechanisms-based&#xD;
      approach to diagnosis and treatment. Recently QST has been used to complement traditional&#xD;
      neurological testing, with greater precision and reliability when assessing somatosensory&#xD;
      aberrations and its clinical value is well recognized. Nevertheless, because of a lack of&#xD;
      standardization and a paucity in normative data, the application of QST in clinical settings&#xD;
      remains scarce. The current project applies QST methodology developed at the Spine center of&#xD;
      Southern Denmark, Lillebaelt Hospital, specifically designed to meet clinical demands and&#xD;
      will be part of a novel initiative to implement and standardize QST in clinical practice in&#xD;
      Denmark. The methodology might prove valuable in a range of different pathologies such as&#xD;
      headache, fibromyalgia and diabetic neuropathy. In addition, the current project will combine&#xD;
      QST measurement with functional measurements and patient reported outcomes on depression,&#xD;
      anxiety and sleep using a national database on pain in collaboration with Pain Center South,&#xD;
      University Hospital Odense. The modulation of QST, their interaction and time course together&#xD;
      with functional measurements and PRO-data might be a powerful combination for the diagnosis&#xD;
      of patients, monitoring and prediction of therapy success. A therapy often used as an adjunct&#xD;
      to medication is transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) which is an inexpensive,&#xD;
      noninvasive and safe treatment for pain. Electrical stimulation is delivered to peripheral&#xD;
      sensory nerves using surface electrodes and has been shown to have a beneficial effect on&#xD;
      centralized pain, showing normalized hyperalgesia post intervention. Nevertheless, the&#xD;
      beneficial effects remain controversial as more high-quality studies are needed. In addition,&#xD;
      pain is complex and depends on contextual, social, psychological and biological factors not&#xD;
      necessarily attributed to a specific pathology. These are rarely considered concurrently. The&#xD;
      current project will evaluate the effect of TENS, in respect to patients psychological,&#xD;
      functional and somatosensory profile, adding valuable information to the existing body of&#xD;
      literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the current project is three-fold; 1) to test the feasibility and validity of&#xD;
      standardized quantitative sensory testing for CRPS in clinical practice, 2) to evaluate&#xD;
      changes in sensitization and 3) to evaluate the effectiveness of transcutaneous electrical&#xD;
      nerve stimulation (TENS) and identify subgroups that benefit the most.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that quantitative sensory testing is feasible in a clinical&#xD;
      setting and will in combination with functional measurements and PRO-data be a valuable tool&#xD;
      for the diagnosis of patients and for the monitoring and prediction of therapy success.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRIAL DESIGN The project will utilize quantitative methods and strong randomized controlled&#xD;
      research designs. The project will consist of two parts; 1) Evaluation of CRPS patient&#xD;
      compared to healthy controls, and validation of method. Participants will be assessed at&#xD;
      baseline prior to treatment with QST (mechanical stimulation, pain thresholds, cold/heat&#xD;
      sensitivity) as outcome measure to identify somatosensory profiles of CRPS patients compared&#xD;
      to normative data. 2) Evaluation of treatment with TENS compared to treatment as usual.&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly allocated to either a TENS intervention group (TENS) or a treatment&#xD;
      as usual group (MED) and will be assessed at baseline, re-test pre TENS, post intervention&#xD;
      and 3 month post intervention. Outcomes include QST and patient reported outcomes (pain,&#xD;
      quality of life, depression, anxiety, sleep, a.m.). Subsequent analysis of data is planned,&#xD;
      to evaluate its ability to predict therapeutic outcomes of TENS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RECRUITMENT AND SAMPLE SIZE Patients will be recruited from the clinic for CRPS and&#xD;
      neuropathic pain, Hospital of South West Jutland, (SVS), University Hospital of Southern&#xD;
      Denmark. The clinic functions as a specialized CRPS clinic in the Region of Southern Denmark.&#xD;
      Healthy controls will be recruited amongst staff at SVS and partners, relatives or friends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned number of trial participants is based on the assumed superiority of TENS&#xD;
      treatment over control. Estimating the sample size for a two-sample means test with a level&#xD;
      of significance at 0.05, assuming a common standard deviation (SD) of 2 in NRS pain intensity&#xD;
      scores indicates that for the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, 34 individuals is required&#xD;
      to obtain a power of at least 80% to establish a minimal clinically significant difference&#xD;
      (MCSD) of 2 in NRS pain scores. The MCSD and common standard deviation is based on previous&#xD;
      findings with a similar patient group and intervention. With an expected drop-out rate of&#xD;
      20%, a total of 46 individuals will be included in the project, 23 in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ALLOCATION All patients will be evaluated at baseline and their QST data will be compared to&#xD;
      a group of healthy controls (Part 1). Subsequently, in part 2, patients will be randomized&#xD;
      with a computer-generated block randomization with a 1:1 allocation ratio using random block&#xD;
      sizes of 2, 4 and 6 in either group TENS or group MED. The randomization restrictions will&#xD;
      not be disclosed, and the sequence will be performed by an external party.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTIONS TENS. Conventional TENS will be performed using two electrodes placed on the&#xD;
      involved extremity and with the following stimulation parameters; a frequency of 100 Hz,&#xD;
      pulse duration 50-100 ms, and at an intensity gradually increased until the patient feels a&#xD;
      strong, tolerable and non-painful sensation. The intensity is incrementally increased based&#xD;
      on patient feedback. Patients will receive guidelines on how to use the TENS device at home&#xD;
      and will over a period of 30 days self-administer TENS as needed. Patients is to fill out a&#xD;
      predefined schedule on paper each day to monitor dose (see appendix).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment as usual. Consist of medicinal treatment, prescribed by a specialist doctor&#xD;
      (Carsten Kock-Jensen, MD) from the CRPS clinic and will be monitored using patients'&#xD;
      medicinal records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL METHODS To evaluate the empirical distributions of the continuous outcomes,&#xD;
      visual inspection of the studentized residuals will be applied to evaluate whether the&#xD;
      assumption of normality is reasonable. The treatment groups will be examined for&#xD;
      comparability based on baseline demographic and prognostic measures. An Intention-To-Treat&#xD;
      (ITT) analysis will be used for all allocated patients and a mixed effects model will be used&#xD;
      on the continuous outcome measures to determine the effects of TENS treatment from baseline&#xD;
      to post treatment and follow-ups [Between groups factor: TENS vs MED, within groups factor:&#xD;
      time]. The model will use robust estimation methods to account for outliers. Finally, a&#xD;
      multiple imputation approach will be used in case of missing data. All p-values &lt; 0.05 will&#xD;
      be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICS AND SIGNIFICANCE The project is to be approved by the Regional Committee on Health&#xD;
      Research Ethics for Southern Denmark and will be conducted according to the declaration of&#xD;
      Helsinki.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of quantitative pain measurements and PRO-data might be a powerful&#xD;
      combination for the diagnosis of patients and monitoring and prediction of therapy success.&#xD;
      It might have the potential to provide patients with individualized mechanism-based pain&#xD;
      therapy and clarify to what extend and to whom TENS is beneficial. This might result in&#xD;
      increased functional capacity and quality of life as a result of significant pain relief.&#xD;
      This could have a significant impact on patients' lives as well as significant socioeconomic&#xD;
      consequences.&#xD;
