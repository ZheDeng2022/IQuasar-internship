      Purpose: to investigate the effect of core stability on PF OA. Methods: Thirty-one females&#xD;
      with PF OA will be recruited. Patients will be randomly assigned into two groups, group A and&#xD;
      group B . Patients in both groups will receive a traditional physical therapy treatment, but&#xD;
      group (B) will receive additional core stability exercise. All patients will be evaluated for&#xD;
      pain, functional performance, and muscular recruitment strategies (onset and duration) of&#xD;
      multifidus, transversus abdominus (TrA), gluteus medius (GM), and vasti measured by&#xD;
      quantitative Electromyography during stair ascent. pre and post-treatment.&#xD;

      A) Procedures for evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The practical section of the studywill be undertaken in 6 weeks (2 sessions a week).&#xD;
      Measurement will be taken before the start of treatment program then after the end of 6 weeks&#xD;
      treatment program f in the following manner:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients will be asked to respond to the questions of the Kujala scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The eleven-point numerical rating scale will be used to measure pain severity&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Investigators will collect the EMG activity of VMO, VL, GM, multifidus, and TrA using&#xD;
           bipolar Ag-AgCl disposable surface electrodes (Better signal solution medical supply&#xD;
           Co., limited, Zhongshan, China) and eight channels highresolution wireless bio amplifier&#xD;
           (WBA) system (Biomation, Almonte, Canada).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Electromyographic data will be sampled at 1000 Hz and bandpass filtered at 50-200 Hz.&#xD;
           For each muscle, three electrodes will be used; two electrodes will be placed ~ 30 mm&#xD;
           apart in the direction of the muscle fibers and a ground electrode will be placed over&#xD;
           the closest bony prominence. Before placement of the electrodes, the subject's skin will&#xD;
           be cleaned with alcohol to reduce impedance and excess hair will be removed to eliminate&#xD;
           shifting of the electrodes if needed. The stair-stepping task will consist of ascending&#xD;
           2 steps (each step will be 40 cm in width, 20 cm in height, without handrails. The depth&#xD;
           of the first and second steps will be 30 cm and 40 cm, respectively) . Participants will&#xD;
           be asked to stand on the floor confronting the stairs and 20 cm away from the edge of&#xD;
           the initial step.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The stair ascent task will be performed barefooted while arms hanged at the side of the&#xD;
           body. Patients will start ascending the steps immediately in response to a command, at&#xD;
           their normal speed with their affected limb. Investigators aren't going to control the&#xD;
           speed of stair ascent, because controlling the timing of stair-stepping can alter the&#xD;
           electromyographic signal as shown earlier for gait in asymptomatic subjects. Before data&#xD;
           acquisition, participants will be asked to perform one practice trial of stair ascent to&#xD;
           get familiarized with the task. Then the participants will perform three test trials&#xD;
           with thirty seconds of rest after each trial to prevent fatigue. The raw data will be&#xD;
           stored on a personal computer for analysis with a custom program in Matlab (Math Works,&#xD;
           Natick, Massachusetts, USA). Investigators will use a mean of data in three trials for&#xD;
           analysis. b) Procedures for treatment: All patients will receive a traditional physical&#xD;
           therapy program in the form of TENS , stretching hamstring, quadriceps and calf muscles&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Group (A) Patients in this group will receive a traditional therapeutic knee&#xD;
           rehabilitation program based on a recent systematic review in the form of mini-squatting&#xD;
           exercise (up to 45O knee flexion measured by a universal goniometer) , strengthening of&#xD;
           hip abductors and external rotators using clamshell exercise . No emphasis will be&#xD;
           placed on stabilizing the core musculature before initiating any of those exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To increase the intensity of exercise, elastic resistance bands will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Group (B) Patients in this group will receive the same program as group (A) plus core&#xD;
           stability exercise and the principles of core stability will be explained to patients&#xD;
           before initiation of treatment and patients will be asked to comply with these&#xD;
           principles during exercise. These principles include learning how to activate&#xD;
           transversus abdominus by abdominal bracing without allowing pelvis tilting and ensure&#xD;
           neutral spine and diaphragmatic breathing during exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
           c) Statistical Analysis: Data management and analysis will be conducted using the&#xD;
           statistical package for social studies (SPSS) version 22 for windows (IBM SPSS, Chicago,&#xD;
           IL, USA). Investigators will conduct the 2X2 Mixed Design MANOVA test to compare the&#xD;
           onset and duration of each muscle, pain intensity, and performance of functional&#xD;
           activities between group A (traditional therapeutic knee rehabilitation) and group B&#xD;
           (core stability) pre-treatment and post-treatment.&#xD;
