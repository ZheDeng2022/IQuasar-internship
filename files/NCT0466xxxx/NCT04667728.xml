      The investigators conducted a three-month quasi-experimental study with an intervention and&#xD;
      control group and ex-ante and ex-post evaluations in one family medicine clinic in Mexico&#xD;
      City. Participants were type 2 diabetes patients with HbA1c&gt;8 mg/dL attending a comprehensive&#xD;
      diabetes care program (MIDE). In addition to the program, the intervention group wore a&#xD;
      professional CGM sensor (iPro™2) during the first six days of the study. Following this&#xD;
      period, intervention group participants had a medical consultation for the CGM results and&#xD;
      treatment adjustments. Additionally, the intervention group participants received an&#xD;
      educational session and a personalized diet plan from a dietitian. After three months, the&#xD;
      intervention group again wore the CGM sensor for one week. The primary outcome variable was&#xD;
      HbA1c level measured at baseline and three months after the CGM intervention. The&#xD;
      investigators analyzed the effect of the intervention on HbA1c levels by estimating the&#xD;
      differences-in-differences treatment effect. Additionally, baseline and three-month CGM and&#xD;
      dietary information was recorded for the intervention group and analyzed using the Student's&#xD;
      paired t-test and mixed-effects generalized linear models to control for patients' baseline&#xD;
      characteristics.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      From May to October 2017, the investigators conducted a three-month pilot study with&#xD;
      intervention and control groups and ex-ante and ex-post evaluations in one ISSSTE family&#xD;
      medicine clinic in Mexico City. Patients with type 2 diabetes in the comprehensive diabetes&#xD;
      care program (MIDE) who were older than 20 years of age and had HbA1c&gt; 8 mg/dL were&#xD;
      considered eligible participants for the study; those who agreed to participate, were&#xD;
      required to sign an informed consent. In May and June, the investigators invited all&#xD;
      consecutive type 2 diabetes patients who attended the MIDE program to join the intervention&#xD;
      group; the investigators followed the same protocol in July and August to assemble the&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group followed the MIDE care plan, consisting of at least two consultations with&#xD;
      a medical doctor and HbA1c measurements at baseline and three months later, as well as weekly&#xD;
      self-care educational group activities. The baseline consultation included a review of HbA1c&#xD;
      levels and treatment adjustments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning of the study, the intervention group had a professional CGM device (iPro™2,&#xD;
      Medtronic, USA) inserted subcutaneously for six days. Before the CGM insertion, the&#xD;
      intervention group received a training session on how to use and calibrate the device through&#xD;
      three daily glucometer readings of capillary glucose. Moreover, intervention group patients&#xD;
      were trained to record daily information on their medications, including the times and&#xD;
      dosages taken; their diet, including the foods and portions consumed; and their physical&#xD;
      activity practices. After six days of device use, intervention group participants had a&#xD;
      consultation with a family physician trained in diabetes to interpret the CGM report results&#xD;
      and adjust their treatment. In addition, a dietitian provided an educational session and&#xD;
      personalized diet plan guided by the CGM results. Participants in the intervention group were&#xD;
      also advised to attend regular MIDE program activities. After three months, the intervention&#xD;
      group wore the sensor again and their HbA1C levels were measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the three-month study period, the intervention and control groups continued their&#xD;
      participation in the MIDE program. The primary outcome variable was HbA1c level measured at&#xD;
      baseline and three months after the CGM intervention. The investigators analyzed the effect&#xD;
      of the intervention on HbA1c levels by estimating the differences-in-differences treatment&#xD;
      effect. Additionally, baseline and three-month CGM and dietary information was recorded for&#xD;
      the intervention group and analyzed using the Student's paired t-test and mixed-effects&#xD;
      generalized linear models to control for patients' baseline characteristics.&#xD;
