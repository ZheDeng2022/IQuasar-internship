  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness and usefulness of the current practice&#xD;
      of various examinations ordered by anesthesiologists during the pre-anesthetic evaluation in&#xD;
      patients who are intended for elective surgery in our hospital. We will also evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of delay &amp; its value to predict postoperative complications.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For each preoperative requested test, we will determine whether the test is indicated based&#xD;
      on the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines and whether it&#xD;
      was effective for adverse effects management or unnecessarily requested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An adherent test was defined as a test that followed NICE, while a non-adherent test was&#xD;
      defined as a test that included an over or under test. Normal test results are based on the&#xD;
      laboratory reference range of normal values.&#xD;

    <description>The anesthesiologist, whom is in charge of preoperative assessment at each unit, will assess patients who are scheduled for elective surgery, and will inform senior anesthesiologists with a minimum 3 years of experience.&#xD;
preoperative investigations will be divided into: First part will be on patient's gender, ASA classification, medical history and examination.&#xD;
Second part will be on Grade of surgery - Minor/ Intermediate/ Major or complex.&#xD;
Third part is requested investigation(s), its rationale, the hierarchy of anesthesiologist requested, and the planned date for surgery.&#xD;
Fourth part is about whether that investigation(s) is adherent with NICE-UK guidelines or not.</description>
