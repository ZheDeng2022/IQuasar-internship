    <description>The iTotal® Identity KRS is a tri-compartmental semi-constrained knee prosthesis composed of three components: a Femoral Component, a Tibial Component, and a Patellar Component.Using patient imaging, a patient-specific implant is designed that best meets the geometric and anatomic requirements of the specific patient. The treatment allows for the placement of a cemented metallic device designed from the patient's natural bone geometry. This process allows definition of the shape and size of the femoral and tibial components of the implant, as well as the disposable instrumentation.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;

             screening visit that warrants a TKR procedure. Disease status is assessed by Clinical&#xD;
             and Radiographic assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;

             nonmelanoma skin cancer), unless subject has been treated with curative intent and&#xD;
             there have been no clinical signs or symptoms of the malignancy for at least 5 years&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Rheumatoid arthritis or other forms of inflammatory joint disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Loss of bone or musculature, osteonecrosis, neuromuscular or vascular compromise in&#xD;
             the area of the joint to be operated on, to an extent that the procedure is&#xD;
             unjustified&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosed with or receiving treatment for osteoporosis that is likely to confound&#xD;
             results in the opinion of the Investigator&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Prior arthroplasty of the affected knee, including High Tibial Osteotomy (HTO)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Compromised PCL or collateral ligament&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe fixed valgus or varus deformity of &gt;15º&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Extensor lag &gt; 15º&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Fixed flexion contracture ≥ 15º&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unwilling or unable to comply with study requirements&#xD;

          -  Participation in another clinical study which would confound results&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Allergy to any of the implant materials&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or planning to become pregnant prior to study TKR procedure (in case of&#xD;
             pregnancy after study TKR procedure, eligibility to continue with the protocol will be&#xD;
             reviewed)&#xD;
