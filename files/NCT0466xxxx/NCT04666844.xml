      The investigators will assess the prediction performance of the modified Surprise Question&#xD;
      (Will the participant be surprised if this patient transfers to hemodialysis in the next 6&#xD;
      months?) for identification of peritoneal dialysis at high risk of transfer to hemodialysis.&#xD;
      The investigators will also assess the prediction performance of a modified mortality&#xD;
      surprise question (Will the participant be surprised if this patient dies in the next 6&#xD;
      months?).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Physicians and nurses will be asked two questions regarding each of their peritoneal dialysis&#xD;
      patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Will the participant be surprised if this patient transfers to hemodialysis in the next&#xD;
           6 months?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Will the participant be surprised if this patient dies in the next 6 months?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed for 6 months for outcomes (with two extra months for ascertainment&#xD;
      of outcomes).&#xD;
