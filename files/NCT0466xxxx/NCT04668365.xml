  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective single arm, multi-center, phase II clinical trial to observe the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of zanubrutinib combined with standard chemotherapy in the treatment for&#xD;
      patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma and CD79A/CD79B genetic abnormality.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma&#xD;
      (NHL). Currently, R-CHOP is world-widely used in the first-line treatment for DLBCL. There&#xD;
      are about one second of patients suffering relapse and drug resistance. ABC-DLBCL mainly&#xD;
      relies on the chronical activity of BCR signal, which can activate the downstream NF-kB&#xD;
      pathway through BTK and MYD88, thereby promoting the occurrence of tumors. A study by Wyndham&#xD;
      H Wilson et al. showed that 23% of ABC-DLBCL patients were accompanied by acquired functional&#xD;
      mutations of the BCR component CD79A/CD79B. Zanubrutinib is a new BTK inhibitor. The goal of&#xD;
      our trial is to assess the efficacy and safety of zanubrutinib combined with standard&#xD;
      chemotherapy in the treatment for patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma and CD79A/CD79B&#xD;
      genetic abnormality.&#xD;
