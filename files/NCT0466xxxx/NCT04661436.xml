  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In view of the lack of systematic curative effect prediction and early evaluation indicators&#xD;
      for breast cancer neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the effective fusion of CEUS（contrast-enhanced&#xD;
      ultrasound） and MRI is realized, and a multi-modal standardized evaluation system of NAT&#xD;
      based on the dynamics across time and full cycle is constructed, in order to find the&#xD;
      predictive effect and early evaluation of NAT. Means to improve the accuracy of NAT patient&#xD;
      selection, treatment course selection, and efficacy evaluation, to achieve controllable and&#xD;
      individualized and precise NAT, thereby improving efficacy, reducing unnecessary treatment&#xD;
      adverse reactions, guiding pathological materials, reducing medical costs, and ultimately&#xD;
      improving breast cancer The patient's DFS and OS. In addition, for patients with axillary&#xD;
      lymph node cN0 before and after neoadjuvant or descending after neoadjuvant, the evaluation&#xD;
      system is used to explore the feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of replacing sentinel&#xD;
      lymph node biopsy or carrying out sentinel lymph node biopsy, which is a useful strategy for&#xD;
      axillary lymph node management in such patients. Develop a theoretical foundation.&#xD;
