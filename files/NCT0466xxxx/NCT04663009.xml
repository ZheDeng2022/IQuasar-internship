      The AutoPulse Resuscitation System Model 100 (ZOLL Medical Corporation, Chelmsford, MA, US)&#xD;
      ZOLL has been used as a standard treatment for a number of subjects in this trial and granted&#xD;
      CE marking for Europe in November of 2003. The AutoPulse device is an automated, portable,&#xD;
      battery-powered, load-band-distributing (LDB), chest compression device, which provides chest&#xD;
      compressions as an adjunct to performing manual cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Use of&#xD;
      the device is intended to provide consistent chest compressions without interruption to a&#xD;
      victim of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OOHCA), to reduce the impact of rescuer fatigue due&#xD;
      to application of manual CPR, and to enable rescuers to address additional patient needs. In&#xD;
      the present study investigators will compare electronic data generated during cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      resuscitation stored in the different multimonitores between LDB and manual chest&#xD;
      compressions.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Load distributing band (LDB) CPR devices have been developed to improve both the quality and&#xD;
      consistency of chest compressions during CPR, as well as lessening the pauses in active&#xD;
      compressions.12,19,20 The LDB device has been shown to improve hemodynamics both in a porcine&#xD;
      model and in humans, but also lower and higher survival to hospital discharge rates using&#xD;
      LDB-CPR compared to M-CPR.21 It is important to emphasize the benefit for early use of the&#xD;
      device (within 8 minutes of a cardiac arrest). Analysis also showed an improvement in the&#xD;
      benefit ratio for centers which used A-CPR over a prolonged period of time.22 Previous&#xD;
      clinical hemodynamic studies have demonstrated increased CPP (20 ± 12 mmHg versus 15 ± 11&#xD;
      mmHg, p &lt; 0.015), peak right atrial pressure (129 ± 32 mmHg versus 83 ± 40 mmHg, p &lt; 0.0001),&#xD;
      peak aortic pressure (153 ± 28 mmHg versus 115 ± 42 mmHg, p &lt; 0.0001) when comparing A-CPR to&#xD;
      MCPR, respectively.20 Research indicates that increased coronary perfusion pressure improves&#xD;
      survival.32 One retrospective review of OOHCA patients found a statistically significant&#xD;
      increase in ROSC with LDB-CPR (39%) as compared to M-CPR (29%, p &lt; 0.003)21 and another OOHCA&#xD;
      trial documented increased survival to ED when patients were treated with LDB-CPR (29%)&#xD;
      compared to M-CPR (19%, p &lt; 0.02).22 In another retrospective historically controlled trial,&#xD;
      survival rates were significantly better for patients treated with LDB-CPR compared to M-CPR&#xD;
      in episodes of OOHCA when used by rapid response EMS personnel. Overall ROSC was 34.5% for&#xD;
      LDB-CPR compared to 20.2% for M-CPR. Survival to hospital admission was improved 20.9% vs.&#xD;
      11.1%, and finally, survival to hospital discharge was improved 9.7% compared to 2.9% for&#xD;
      M-CPR. However, no difference was found between the survivors of the two groups with respect&#xD;
      to cerebral performance or overall performance categories.23,24 A randomized, controlled&#xD;
      trial (RCT) compared LDB-CPR to M-CPR with respect to 4 hour survival following the first&#xD;
      recorded emergency call (911). This trial was terminated when no difference was found between&#xD;
      the two groups in survival to 4 hours. Worse cerebral performance at hospital discharge was&#xD;
      found in the A-CPR group.10 However, it may be the case that this trial had a suboptimal&#xD;
      design and significant methodological problems.25,27,28 Finally, the largest RCT, CIRC&#xD;
      compared integrated LDB-CPR with high quality M-CPR and found that of 4753 randomized&#xD;
      patients, 522 (11.0%) met post enrollment exclusion criteria. Therefore, 2099 (49.6%)&#xD;
      received integrated LDB (iLDB)-CPR and 2132 (50.4%) M-CPR. Sustained ROSC (emergency&#xD;
      department admittance), 24h survival and hospital discharge (unknown for 12 cases) for&#xD;
      iLDB-CPR compared to M-CPR were 600 (28.6%) vs. 689 (32.3%), 456 (21.8%) vs. 532 (25.0%), 196&#xD;
      (9.4%) vs. 233 (11.0%) patients, respectively. The adjusted odds ratio of survival to&#xD;
      hospital discharge for iLDB-CPR compared to M-CPR, was 1.06 (95% CI 0.83-1.37), meeting the&#xD;
      criteria for equivalence. The 20 min CPR fraction was 80.4% for iLDB-CPR and 80.2% for M-CPR.&#xD;
      The authors conclude that compared to high-quality M-CPR, iLDB-CPR resulted in statistically&#xD;
      equivalent survival to hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study investigators explore both positive and negative effects of LDB- and&#xD;
      M-CPR in standard daily EMS treatment of OOHCA patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge is limited as to the best way to optimize resuscitation of patients with OOHCA.&#xD;
      This is evidenced by the low survival rates currently being achieved.2,3,4 As is well&#xD;
      evidenced, the early onset of improved circulation during resuscitation results in improved&#xD;
      survival rates.32,33,34 Experimental animal studies have indicated improved myocardial blood&#xD;
      flow and showed improvement in key pressure measurements including aortic and right atrial&#xD;
      peak over M-CPR.12 Upon the addition of epinephrine, LDB-CPR also showed increased cerebral&#xD;
      blood flow, a key factor in preserving neurological intactness, as well as improving CPP.12&#xD;
      Experimental animal studies also show improvement in survival to neurological intactness of&#xD;
      ACPR over M-CPR.19 It appears that the use of the LDB has been associated with increased&#xD;
      end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2, versus M-CPR).38,39,40 In one of the studies, there was also a&#xD;
      significant increase in short-term survival over that of M-CPR.39 None of these studies were&#xD;
      definitive and did not follow the patients for long term survival but they indicated that LDB&#xD;
      may be capable of a real contribution to resuscitative medicine and merited a further, more&#xD;
      thorough investigation.38,39,40 Several studies have indicated that higher levels of ETCO2&#xD;
      appeared to be prognostic of ROSC.35,36,37 One trial concluded that monitoring of ETCO2 had&#xD;
      potential as a noninvasive indicator of cardiac output during resuscitations attempts and&#xD;
      could also serve as a prognostic indicator. This same trial reported that if a patient had&#xD;
      initial, average and final ETCO2 readings of 10mmHg, they were able to correctly identify&#xD;
      100% of those patients achieving ROSC with specificities of 74.1%, 90% and 81.4%&#xD;
      respectively.36 Another trial concluded that ETCO2 may also have value in determining when to&#xD;
      terminate resuscitative efforts.37 Although an RCT was inconclusive as to the benefits of use&#xD;
      of the LDB-CPR10; a later trial, a non-randomized, phased observational cohort evaluation,&#xD;
      resulted in an increase of survival to hospital discharge from 3% to nearly 10%.23,24&#xD;
      Therefore, it has been hypothesized that timely use of an LDB-CPR to assist in improved&#xD;
      circulation could significantly increase survival rates. In 2006, Drs. Lewis and Niemann&#xD;
      published an editorial in JAMA, further analyzing the outcomes of these seemingly&#xD;
      contradictory studies. While indicating that M-CPR may be better than generally recognized,&#xD;
      they also state that there are numerous reasons for conflicting results. They agree that it&#xD;
      is not possible to reach any definitive conclusions as to the value of LDB-CPR without&#xD;
      further investigation. They advocate a well-controlled trial with clearly defined endpoints,&#xD;
      with particular mention made of ensuring the quality of M-CPR used as a comparison. Several&#xD;
      sources have discussed the many factors that could have influenced outcome, including strong&#xD;
      preconceived notions regarding effective therapies as well as factors such as the Hawthorne&#xD;
      Effect.25,27,28,41 Drs. Lewis and Niemann said it best when they conclude that &quot;only by&#xD;
      aggressively identifying and rigorously testing promising new therapies will the outcome&#xD;
      improve for patients who experience sudden cardiac death.&quot;25 The CIRC trial was designed with&#xD;
      the goal of being such a trial. The goal of that trial was to test the positive results of&#xD;
      the non-randomized trial in the context of an RCT, utilizing a protocol designed to determine&#xD;
      whether LDB-CPR was superior, or equivalent to M-CPR using evidence-based medical&#xD;
      methodologies. The Circulation-Improving Resuscitation Care (CIRC) trial, an international,&#xD;
      multi-center trial, was designed to compare the effectiveness of integrated resuscitation&#xD;
      (iLDB-CPR) protocol, to conventional M-CPR for the treatment of OOHCA-PCE. Compared to&#xD;
      high-quality M-CPR, iLDB-CPR resulted in statistically equivalent survival to hospital&#xD;
      discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are not aware of any previous publication comparing LDB- with M-CPR in a&#xD;
      standard OOHCA situation between two different EMS's in respect to outcome and CPR process.&#xD;
