  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial investigates how a communication strategy works in increasing human papillomavirus&#xD;
      (HPV) vaccines in community pharmacies among adolescents. Although pharmacies are vaccine&#xD;
      providers, low vaccination rates are persistent as a result of low awareness of pharmacy&#xD;
      services and poor engagement by pharmacy staff with adolescents about vaccines. The purpose&#xD;
      of this study is to test a communication strategy that identifies vaccine-eligible children&#xD;
      and teaches pharmacy staff how to effectively communicate with them about HPV vaccination in&#xD;
      order to increase HPV vaccination rates.&#xD;

      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 1: Participants participate in a semi-structured interview in-person or via phone over 90&#xD;
      minutes about barriers/facilitators of HPV vaccination in pharmacies. Pharmacies of which the&#xD;
      pharmacy staff participants work undergo an environmental scan to characterize the pharmacy's&#xD;
      environment, vaccination workflow, and team dynamics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 2: Participants provide feedback on survey questions via cognitive testing. Pharmacy&#xD;
      staff complete an online survey over 10-15 minutes to assess the acceptability,&#xD;
      appropriateness, and feasibility of providing HPV vaccination to children aged 9-17 in their&#xD;
      pharmacies. Pharmacy staff then attend communication training sessions, and then undergo a&#xD;
      communication strategy intervention over no more than 120 minutes consisting of identifying&#xD;
      vaccine-eligible children and recommending HPV and other vaccines. Pharmacy staff employ the&#xD;
      new communication strategy in their pharmacy over 6 months, and then complete an online&#xD;
      survey over 10-15 minutes.&#xD;
