  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is associated with increased risk of poor cardiometabolic health.&#xD;
      Regular exercise is recommended for optimal management of comorbidities in T1D. Unique&#xD;
      barriers to exercise exist for T1D, including fear of hypoglycemia, unpredictable glycemic&#xD;
      excursions with exercise, and inadequate knowledge about exercise. Unlike traditional&#xD;
      moderate intensity continuous training (MICT) which requires extended periods of time, high&#xD;
      intensity interval training (HIIT) requires minimal time (~10 minutes of exercise per&#xD;
      session), with the potential to rapidly stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolism.&#xD;
      The extent to which these exercise strategies alter metabolomic signatures of carbohydrate,&#xD;
      fat, and amino acid metabolism in T1D is unknown. The overall goal of the proposed project is&#xD;
      to identify the acute metabolic effects and physiological modifiers of HIIT compared to MICT&#xD;
      and control (CON) using metabolomic profiling and cardiometabolic assessments in 14 adults&#xD;
      with T1D. Using a randomized cross-over approach, the primary aim is to compare the&#xD;
      metabolomics response immediately post, 1 hr post, and glycemic control through 48 hrs after&#xD;
      HIIT, compared to MICT matched for total energy expenditure, versus a no exercise CON. An&#xD;
      additional aim will be to characterize the influence of biological sex and physiological&#xD;
      outcomes (i.e. body composition, lean mass, visceral fat) on the metabolomics profile of&#xD;
      these subjects. Outcomes from the present study, with existing data from our team, will lay&#xD;
      the foundation for a larger diet and exercise lifestyle intervention that will ultimately&#xD;
      lead to changes in clinical practice to co-manage glycemia and cardiometabolic comorbidities.&#xD;
