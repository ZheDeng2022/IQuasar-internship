  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effectiveness of acalabrutinib treatment in patients with chronic&#xD;
      lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) deemed at high risk for Richter's Transformation (RT). This is a&#xD;
      single arm study. Enrolled patients will initiate therapy with acalabrutinib and will dose&#xD;
      continuously. While on study, subjects will be monitored monthly for the first 3 months, then&#xD;
      every three months thereafter until disease progression, discontinuation due to toxicity,&#xD;
      death, or study completion.&#xD;

      This is a multi-center, single arm, Phase II clinical trial to investigate the effectiveness&#xD;
      of acalabrutinib treatment within 6 months of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) diagnosis&#xD;
      for patients with CLL deemed at high risk for Richter's Transformation (RT).&#xD;
