  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A behavioral study that will examine how pain perception is affected by different types of&#xD;
      conditioning and by context, with a few participants and multiple sessions (&quot;N-of-few&quot;&#xD;
      design).&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Within participant changes in subjective ratings of acute thermal pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured repeatedly during pain tasks, in each of the 10 sessions of the experiment (up to 3 sessions per week, depending on the participants' availability), immediately after thermal stimuli. Averaged and compared across conditions.</time_frame>
    <description>Each session of the experiment includes pain tasks, in which multiple thermal stimuli are delivered. Following each thermal stimulus, participants are asked to rate how painful it was, on a semi-circular computerized scale. Ratings are based on the angle (0-180), with higher angle representing higher pain ratings. The investigators will compare the pain ratings within participant across conditions.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Within participant changes in subjective ratings of pain expectations</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured repeatedly during pain tasks, in each of the 10 sessions of the experiment (up to 3 sessions per week, depending on the participants' availability), immediately before thermal stimuli. Averaged and compared across conditions.</time_frame>
    <description>Each session of the experiment includes pain tasks, in which multiple thermal stimuli are delivered. Before some of the thermal stimuli, participants are asked to rate how painful they expect the next stimulus to be, on a semi-circular computerized scale. Ratings are based on the angle (0-180), with higher angle representing higher expectations ratings. The investigators will compare the expectation ratings within participant across conditions.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Within participant changes in skin conductance response measured with a Biopac MP160 device</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured continuously during pain stimuli in each of the 10 sessions of the experiment (up to 3 sessions per week, depending on the participants' availability). Averaged and compared across conditions.</time_frame>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Within participant thermal imaging of the face</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured continuously during pain stimuli in each of the 10 sessions of the experiment (up to 3 sessions per week, depending on the participants' availability). Averaged and compared across conditions.</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will obtain thermal recordings of participant's face with an infrared camera, and compare the heat signature of the face (the temperature in different parts of the face) across conditions.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Within participant facial expressions</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured continuously during pain stimuli in each of the 10 sessions of the experiment (up to 3 sessions per week, depending on the participants' availability). Averaged and compared across conditions.</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will obtain continuous facial video recordings of participants during the pain tasks with a video camera. The investigators will analyze these data according to Facial Action Units (facial expressions) that are known to be related to pain, and compare them across conditions.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Within participant changes in heart rate measured with a Biopac MP160 device</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured continuously during pain stimuli in each of the 10 sessions of the experiment (up to 3 sessions per week, depending on the participants' availability). Averaged and compared across conditions.</time_frame>

Identifying information will not be released, including the facial videos, of which only non-identifiable features will be extracted and shared.</ipd_description>
    <ipd_time_frame>All data will be de-identified prior to sharing. Raw data will be submitted to NDA within one year from the end of data collection or 6 months from the acceptance date of the first primary study manuscript on the full dataset (excluding methods development papers), whichever is later. Analyzed data/maps of statistical results and models accompanying each paper will be submitted to NDA/OpenFMRI when the primary study manuscript is accepted.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>These data would generally be made available to any qualified investigator for neuroimaging studies only including:&#xD;
i. Research on any brain phenomenon; ii. Neuroimaging research on non-disease traits (intelligence, behavioral traits); iii. Methods development research.&#xD;
The requesting investigator must provide documentation of local IRB approval.&#xD;
These data would not be made available to:&#xD;
i. Any criminal justice organization, because data may not be used for any criminal justice applications; ii. Any commercial entity, because use of the data is limited to not-for-profit organizations and data may not be used for any commercial purposes.</ipd_access_criteria>
