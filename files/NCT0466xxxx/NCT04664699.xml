  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized control trial aims to assess if Plethysmographic Variability Index&#xD;
      (PVI)-based therapy improves patient outcome in terms of reduced amount and type of fluid&#xD;
      used, lower postoperative lactate levels, lesser increment in sodium and chloride levels,&#xD;
      improvement of blood gases in term of pH and BE, and reduction in serum creatinine as&#xD;
      compared to standard monitoring based therapy in patients with severe traumatic brain injury.&#xD;

      This is a single centre, with equal randomisation, single blind, parallel group study&#xD;
      conducted in Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia. The physician allocated to the standard&#xD;
      monitoring or PVI group were aware of the allocated arm, wherelse the next of kin were&#xD;
      blinded to the allocated arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study took place in Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia , Kubang Kerian , Kelantan from&#xD;
      July 2019 Until October 2020. Patient who presented to emergency department HUSM diagnosed&#xD;
      with severe traumatic brain injury based on a GCS ( Glasgow Coma Scale ≤ 8), Brain CT Scan&#xD;
      finding (based on Marshall and Rotterdam scoring), and the SAPS (simplified acute physical&#xD;
      injury) score and were planned for craniotomies were assessed for eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation sequence was already created using the online randomisation application.&#xD;
      (www.randomizer.org), with a 1:1 allocation by the primary investigator. Once a patient with&#xD;
      severe traumatic brain injury has been posted for an emergency craniotomy, a white envelope&#xD;
      was given to the anesthetic medical officer, If the patient fulfils the eligibility criteria,&#xD;
      and the next of kin have consented for recruitment to this study, a second sealed white&#xD;
      envelope will be given to the anesthetic medical officer in charge, which contains data&#xD;
      collection sheets and protocols. The envelope given was sequentially numbered and sealed ,&#xD;
      with the patients name, identity card, and date of enrolment written on it by the physician.&#xD;
      These sealed white envelopes, with the PVI machine was kept in a locked cupboard in the&#xD;
      Anesthesia department in Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia, only accessible to the primary&#xD;
      investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Doctors in charge will be given a separate protocol for PVI based and Standard monitoring&#xD;
      based which acts a a guide for fluid management in patients in from induction of anesthesia (&#xD;
      0 H) and 24 hours post induction in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) (24 H). Data was then&#xD;
      collected by the principle investigator at the end of 24 hours, or reevaluated earlier if any&#xD;
      adverse reaction was reported by the doctor in charge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size calculation was performed using Power and Sample Size Calculations System, .&#xD;
      From the study by Tat in 2016, the standard deviation for amount of fluid used was 2637.45,&#xD;
      with a mean difference of 1361.31. The α value is set at 0.05 and power of study at 80%. The&#xD;
      sample size is calculated using t test. Adding a drop out rate of 10%, the number in each arm&#xD;
      will be 34. All statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Package for the Social&#xD;
      Science (SPSS) version 26. Results were presented as frequency (percentages) for descriptive&#xD;
      data, mean ( standard deviation) for total fluids as well as mean (confidence interval) for&#xD;
      laboratory parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 64 patient were deemed eligible. The demographic data in between groups were&#xD;
      analyzed using descriptive analysis chi square test. Independent t-test was used to analyze&#xD;
      the total volume and different types of fluid used. The difference in lactate, pH, BE, Sodium&#xD;
      and Chloride- and Creatinine between groups was analysed using the Independent t-test.&#xD;
