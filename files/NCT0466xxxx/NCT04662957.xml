  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common functional gastrointestinal&#xD;
      disorders characterized by recurrent abdominal pain associated with defecation or a change in&#xD;
      bowel habits without any structural abnormalities. Despite extensive research, the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of IBS has not been clearly elucidated yet. Recent studies have shown that&#xD;
      disturbed gut microbiota may promote the development and maintenance of IBS. Significant&#xD;
      changes in the microbial communities of healthy controls vs IBS patients have been reported&#xD;
      in several studies. These findings promoted the research on probiotics for the treatment of&#xD;
      IBS. Probiotics are live microorganisms which, when administered at the right dose, have a&#xD;
      positive effect on human health. The currently published systemic reviews and meta-analyses&#xD;
      of randomized clinical trials have indicated that probiotics have beneficial clinical effects&#xD;
      and can help to reduce global and specific IBS symptoms significantly. However, the effect&#xD;
      depends on the specific composition of the probiotic preparation, and some meta-analyzes&#xD;
      indicate that multi-strain preparations are more effective than single-strain preparations.&#xD;
      Therefore, further research is highly anticipated. The purpose of the current clinical trial&#xD;
      is to assess the effectiveness of multi-strain probiotic preparation in patients with&#xD;
      diarrhea predominant IBS (IBS-D).&#xD;

    <measure>Changes in severity of IBS symptoms using IBS Severity Scoring System (IBS-SSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline at 4 and 8 weeks of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>IBS-Severity Scoring System is a 5-question survey that asks: 1. the severity of abdominal pain, 2. frequency of abdominal pain, 3. severity of abdominal distention, 4.dissatisfaction with bowel habit, and 5. interference with quality of life over the past 10 days. Subjects respond to each question on a 100-point visual analogue scale. Each of the five question generates a maximum score of 100 point, and total scores can range from 0-500 with higher scores indicating severe symptoms. A decrease of 30 points is associated with a clinically meaningful improvement.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Improvement or worsening of IBS global symptoms using Global Improvement Scale (IBS-GIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline at 4 and 8 weeks of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>IBS-Global Improvement Scale asseses IBS symptoms using a patient-defined 7 point Linkert scale ranging from symptoms substantially worse to substantially improved.&#xD;
Patients answer the question &quot;Have you felt any change in the severity of your symptoms over the past 7 days compared to how you felt before the medicine was given?&#xD;
The answers are recorded based on the 7-point scale:&#xD;
I feel that the symptoms have worsened significantly&#xD;
I feel that the symptoms have moderately worsened&#xD;
I feel that the symptoms have slightly worsened&#xD;
I feel no change&#xD;
I feel a slight improvement&#xD;
I feel moderate improvement&#xD;
I feel significant improvement&#xD;
IBS-GIS score indicates: improvement if is &gt;4 or worsening if is&lt;4, no change if is 4</description>

    <measure>Changes in adequate relief of IBS symptoms (IBS-AR)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline at 4 and 8 weeks of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>IBS-Adequate Relief (IBS-AR) is a dichotomous single item that asks participants &quot;Over the past week (7 days) have you had adequate relief of your IBS symptoms? The answer is YES or NO.</description>

Bristol Scale is designed to classify faeces into seven groups: type 1-2 indicate constipation, type 3-4 are &quot;normal&quot; stools; type 5-7 indicate diarrhea.</description>
