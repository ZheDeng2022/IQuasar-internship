      Change in coronary microcirculation and Fractional Flow Reserve after Transcatheter Aortic&#xD;
      Valve Implantation in patients with concomitant coronary artery disease and severe aortic&#xD;
      stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severe aortic stenosis is the most common indication of valvular replacement in developed&#xD;
      countries. Stable coronary artery disease (CAD) is frequently associated with severe aortic&#xD;
      stenosis in patients treated by Transcatheter Aortic Valvular Implantation (TAVI). Its&#xD;
      prognostic impact is not clearly established, and available studies uncommonly used&#xD;
      functional assessment of severity from a coronary stenosis to stratify the risk in this&#xD;
      situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) is recommended to guide revascularization by percutaneous&#xD;
      coronary intervention (PCI) in clinical practice. Its use is not validated in patients with&#xD;
      severe aortic stenosis. Left ventricular hypertrophy induced by aortic obstruction leading to&#xD;
      microvascular disorders, and can alter coronary reserve, possibly biasing FFR values. After&#xD;
      aortic valvular replacement, a myocardial reverse remodeling is described, generating a&#xD;
      decrease in hypertrophy, interstitial oedema, and inflammation. Its effect on coronary&#xD;
      microcirculatory reserve is not known. Some studies have shown improvement in coronary&#xD;
      reserve immediately after TAVI and this effect seemed to last long after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to assess the effects of inverse myocardial remodeling on coronary&#xD;
      microcirculatory function and its association with FFR values before and after TAVI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This monocentric and prospective observational study aims to include patients with stable&#xD;
      coronary artery disease and undergoing TAVI for severe aortic stenosis via transfemoral&#xD;
      access, from November 2020 at Nantes University Hospital, France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients have severe symptomatic aortic stenosis, secondary to degenerative disease&#xD;
      confirmed by transthoracic echocardiography (mean gradient &gt;40 mmHg and/or valve area &lt;1 cm2)&#xD;
      and significant epicardial coronary stenosis (&gt; or = 50%) assessed by coronarography&#xD;
      performed in systematic preoperative work-up. These patients are deemed for TAVI and a&#xD;
      first-line medical treatment for CAD, after heart team decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collegially chosen strategy to manage CAD in this population consists in assessing&#xD;
      hemodynamic parameters from a coronary stenosis during the TAVI procedure, using functionals&#xD;
      tests for ischemia (FFR, IMR, CFR) from a concomitant coronarography. Patients will be&#xD;
      routinely admitted in hospital 6 months after TAVI, for clinical and echocardiographic&#xD;
      reassessment, and coronarography control. Functional tests will be repeated and according to&#xD;
      results, continuation of medical therapy or PCI is proposed, at operator's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All procedures are performed within the same site by 1 medical team including 4&#xD;
      interventional cardiologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the TAVI procedure, a computerized multi-sliced tomography is systematically performed&#xD;
      to validate the percutaneous approach by femoral access and to choose which prothesis model&#xD;
      will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In most cases, TAVI procedure are performed under local anesthesia and mild sedation, under&#xD;
      anesthetist supervision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The common femoral artery is punctured by percutaneous approach, above the femoral&#xD;
      bifurcation and a 16-French sheath is inserted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three available models of aortic bioprothesis are implanted in our center, the Sapien 3&#xD;
      (EDWARDS Lifescience) the Corevalve Evolute R (Metdtronik) and the Accurate Neo 2 (Boston&#xD;
      Scientific) Two Perclose ProGlide devices (Abbott Vascular) are used to perform the&#xD;
      perpendicular preclosing. After the deployment of the prosthesis, the TAVI sheath is removed&#xD;
      and the nodes from the two previously placed ProGlide devices are tightened. Final femoral&#xD;
      angiographic control is not systematic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concomitant coronarography is performed by radial artery access site, using a 6-French&#xD;
      sheath.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemodynamics measures are recorded by PressureWire X Guidewire (Abott Vascular) wireless&#xD;
      devices to a computer and processed by the CoroFlow Coroventis software (Abbott Vascular) to&#xD;
      carry out multimodal physiological evaluation. FFR, CFR, and IMR measures will be repeated&#xD;
      before and immediately after valve implantation. These parameters will be reassessed 6 months&#xD;
      after TAVI.&#xD;
