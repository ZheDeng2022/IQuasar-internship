    <textblock>
      Sensory polyneuropathy is one of the most prevalent neurological disorders and a common&#xD;
      finding in renal transplant recipients (RTR). However, prevalence, course and underlying&#xD;
      aetiology in this specific patient group remain unexplored. To diagnose sensory&#xD;
      polyneuropathy in RTR in clinical practice, a relatively easy and inexpensive method is&#xD;
      needed. The adapted modified Toronto Clinical Neuropathy Score (amTCNS) is such a score. This&#xD;
      score would enable internal medicine physicians to diagnose polyneuropathy in a reliable way&#xD;
      without the need of additional examinations. However, a validation of the amTCNS with the&#xD;
      golden standard of diagnosing sensory polyneuropathy, which are quantitative sensory testing&#xD;
      (QST) and nerve conduction studies (NCS), is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this observational cross-sectional study is to validate the amTCNS with QST&#xD;
      and NCS and to determine reference values of the amTCNS. 205 RTR will be included to take&#xD;
      part in one study visit which encompasses neurological examination according to the protocol&#xD;
      of the amTCNS, QST and NCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main study endpoint is to validate the amTCNS result with QST and NCS. To reach this&#xD;
      endpoint different study parameters will be included which are the result of the amTCNS,&#xD;
      results of the QST (thermal threshold testing), and results of the NCS (amplitude, velocity&#xD;
      and distal latency of measurements at the sural sensory nerve, ulnar sensory nerve, peroneal&#xD;
      motor nerve, tibial motor nerve and ulnar motor nerve, soleus H reflex).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sensory polyneuropathy is one of the most prevalent neurological disorders. A Dutch study&#xD;
      observed an incidence of all types of polyneuropathy of 77 per 100.000 person-years, which&#xD;
      increases with age. Besides, previous studies evaluated the impact of polyneuropathy on&#xD;
      quality of life in different patient populations and showed that accompanying symptoms affect&#xD;
      daily living and influence morbidity and mortality of patients adversely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We can classify sensory polyneuropathies broadly into either small fibre neuropathies, large&#xD;
      fibre neuropathies or mixed small and large fibre neuropathies. In small fibre neuropathies&#xD;
      the thinly myelinated A delta and unmyelinated C fibres are affected. Therefore, the&#xD;
      transmission of thermal and noxious sensory input is disturbed translating to symptoms of&#xD;
      sharp, painful, or burning paraesthesia, sensory loss or numbness, and the inability to&#xD;
      discriminate between hot and cold sensation. Disorders affecting the large myelinated A delta&#xD;
      fibres lead to an impaired vibration sensation and proprioception. Patients will complain&#xD;
      about a combination of symptoms of sensory loss, paraesthesia, and gait imbalance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensory polyneuropathy is a common finding in renal transplant recipients (RTR), but little&#xD;
      is known about prevalence, course, or underlying aetiology in this specific group. It is&#xD;
      known that patients are at a high risk to develop polyneuropathy before renal transplantation&#xD;
      due to chronic kidney disease. Therefore, related to the previous state of chronic kidney&#xD;
      disease uremic and diabetic polyneuropathy are probable underlying aetiologies in RTR.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the use of immunosuppressive medication after transplantation may result in&#xD;
      polyneuropathic symptoms and signs. These circumstances may explain the high prevalence of&#xD;
      polyneuropathy in RTR but in order to gain more understanding it is necessary to diagnose and&#xD;
      stage polyneuropathy in an easy and convenient way in RTR. Furthermore, early diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment of certain types of polyneuropathy can prevent further worsening of neuropathic&#xD;
      symptoms and signs, or even reverse the neurologic deficits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnostic approach of polyneuropathy differs depending on the type of affected nerve&#xD;
      fibre and the distribution of nerve damage in the respective type of polyneuropathy. The&#xD;
      diagnosis of polyneuropathy is generally based on the presence of distal sensory and&#xD;
      sensorimotor symptoms and signs, and loss of function, which is consistent with the clinical&#xD;
      picture. Nevertheless, to reveal an underlying large fibre aetiology, nerve conduction&#xD;
      studies (NCS) are needed. With the help of NCS, it is possible to categorize the&#xD;
      polyneuropathy as primary axonal or primary demyelinating. This standard diagnostic test,&#xD;
      however, exclusively enables measurement of large fibres and patients with pure small fibre&#xD;
      neuropathies will not show any nerve conduction abnormalities. Hence, quantitative sensory&#xD;
      testing (QST) is required to assess the function of small sensory nerve fibres. However, NCS&#xD;
      and QST are time-consuming, fairly expensive, and the investigator needs a certain level of&#xD;
      expertise. Alternatively, different clinical scores exist which aim to detect and to stage&#xD;
      polyneuropathy based on symptoms and signs. The Toronto Clinical Neuropathy Score (TCNS) was&#xD;
      designed for diabetic sensorimotor polyneuropathy but it was shown that its usefulness&#xD;
      extends beyond diabetic polyneuropathy. These results were based on correlations of the TCNS&#xD;
      with clinical, electrophysiological and disability parameters in non-diabetic&#xD;
      polyneuropathies. The same study confirmed that reliability and accuracy were excellent.&#xD;
      Eventually, the TCNS was modified (into the mTCNS) to better capture a scale of simple&#xD;
      sensory tests representative for early-stage dysfunction and reflex testing was removed due&#xD;
      to its high inter-rater variability. The mTCNS was demonstrated to maintain acceptable&#xD;
      correlation with the precursor score. In the University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG) a&#xD;
      large population of RTR is followed within the scope of the TransplantLines cohort study and&#xD;
      biobank. For this purpose, the mTCNS was further adapted by omitting testing of temperature&#xD;
      sense due to practical reasons (adapted into the amTCNS). To be able to study prevalence,&#xD;
      course, and underlying aetiology in this specific population of RTR it is crucial to reveal&#xD;
      whether the amTCNS correlates with the golden standards of diagnosing polyneuropathy, NCS and&#xD;
      QST. In the long-term, the amTCNS has great potential to help clinicians from various&#xD;
      disciplines without the specific expertise needed for NCS and QST to diagnose polyneuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, the aim of this research proposal is to validate the amTCNS with NCS and QST&#xD;
      for a population of RTR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to validate the adapted modified Toronto Clinical Neuropathy Score&#xD;
      (amTCNS) with QST and NCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to define reference values of the amTCNS dependent on predictors&#xD;
      in a healthy subject population. This healthy subject population consists of potential kidney&#xD;
      donors that were already seen and examined within the TransplantLines cohort study and&#xD;
      biobank prior to this study. These healthy subjects will not undergo QST or NCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research protocol contains a cross-sectional study or can alternatively be described as&#xD;
      a validation study. The aim is to examine the validity of the amTCNS, a clinical score that&#xD;
      was designed to capture symptoms and signs of sensory polyneuropathy. The amTCNS will be&#xD;
      validated with QST and NCS which are defined as golden standards of diagnosing small fibre&#xD;
      neuropathies and large fibre neuropathies, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to validate the amTCNS for a population of RTR to be able to subsequently identify&#xD;
      and follow up polyneuropathies in this specific population in a more convenient way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RTR will be recruited retrospectively after their participation in the TransplantLines cohort&#xD;
      and biobank study in the UMCG by telephone. Every possible future participant will receive&#xD;
      written information concerning this study (aim, design and duration of the study,&#xD;
      disadvantages and risks of participation). The subjects will be required to sign the written&#xD;
      informed consent form within two weeks if they want to take part in this study. The subjects&#xD;
      will be informed that if they give consent for participation in the study that they may&#xD;
      withdraw consent at any time. This withdrawal of consent may be given to the investigator in&#xD;
      oral or written form. After receiving the written informed consent a screening via telephone&#xD;
      will be planned to assess whether the potential participant meets the inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The amTCNS result will be calculated based on a questionnaire and neurological examination.&#xD;
      This includes a symptoms score assessing foot pain, numbness, tingling, weakness, ataxia and&#xD;
      upper limb symptoms, and a sensory test score including testing of pinprick sensation, light&#xD;
      touch, proprioception and vibration sense. QST consists of thermal threshold testing in which&#xD;
      the thresholds of warm sensation and cold sensation will be determined following the method&#xD;
      of limits and the method of levels. NCS will include testing of the CMAP amplitude and distal&#xD;
      motor latency of the tibial, peroneal and ulnar nerve; the SNAP amplitude of the sural and&#xD;
      ulnar nerve; nerve conduction velocity and the soleus H-reflex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to assess polyneuropathy, sensory testing will be performed. Sensory testing as an&#xD;
      objective physical event requires a response of the subject which is a subjective report. To&#xD;
      minimize the possible bias resulting from this, neurological examination will be performed&#xD;
      first, and afterwards QST and NCS will follow. In this way, the golden standards of&#xD;
      diagnosing polyneuropathy which are QST and NCS will be performed in the end. Subsequently,&#xD;
      patients will not have an objective appraisal about the severity of their polyneuropathy when&#xD;
      neurological examination is performed. Participants will not be informed about their result.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the investigators will be blinded: a first investigator will perform the&#xD;
      neurological examination according to the amTCNS, a second investigator will perform QST and&#xD;
      a third investigator will perform NCS without the second and third investigator being&#xD;
      informed about the amTCNS result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to this study the amTCNS was already carried out in 200 healthy subjects which were&#xD;
      potential kidney donors. Clinical characteristics that function as independent predictors of&#xD;
      the amTCNS in a healthy subject population will be determined by means of ordinal logistic&#xD;
      regression analyses. The 95th percentile of the amTCNS final score will be calculated to&#xD;
      define reference values according to the identified independent predictors. The outcome of&#xD;
      the polyneuropathy measures of the current study will be dichotomized as follows: presence of&#xD;
      polyneuropathy (both aberrant QST and NCS), presence of small fibre neuropathy (aberrant&#xD;
      QST), presence of large fibre neuropathy (aberrant NCS). These outcomes will be opposed to&#xD;
      the dichotomous outcome of presence of polyneuropathy according to the reference value of the&#xD;
      amTCNS that was previously established in a healthy subject population. Sensitivity,&#xD;
      specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare amTCNS cut-off points for diagnosis, the reference values determined in the cohort&#xD;
      of healthy subjects without polyneuropathy will be compared with the data in RTR. Accuracy of&#xD;
      the amTCNS in RTR will be determined by the area under the receiver operating characteristic&#xD;
      curve, with presence of polyneuropathy as the dichotomous outcome variable and amTCNS as the&#xD;
      test. The optimal diagnostic threshold will be identified by the point on the receiver&#xD;
      operating characteristic curve closest to the point of perfect discrimination.&#xD;
