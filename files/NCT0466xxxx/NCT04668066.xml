  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the first time PF-07242813 will be given to humans. The purpose of the study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of escalating single and repeat doses&#xD;
      of PF-07242813 in healthy participants and in participants with moderate to severe atopic&#xD;
      dermatitis. An additional goal is to assess the pharmacodynamics of PF-07242813 in&#xD;
      participants with moderate to severe AD, including potential effects on clinical signs and&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
