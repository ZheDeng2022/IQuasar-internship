  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Echo intensity (EI) assessment using ultrasonography helps monitoring disease-induced muscle&#xD;
      quality changes. However, there are no study investigating the reliability of EI in patients&#xD;
      with knee osteoarthritis (OA). The primary aim of the present study was to investigate the&#xD;
      inter and intra-rater reliability of EI evaluation by grayscale histogram analysis of&#xD;
      quadriceps femoris muscle in patients with knee OA. The second aim was to compare the mean&#xD;
      grayscale values obtained using both the Free Hand Tool (FHT) and Rectangular Marquee Tool&#xD;
      (RMT) methods in ImageJ. Thirty patients with knee OA were included in this cross-sectional&#xD;
      study. The echogenicity measurements of the Rectus Femoris, Vastus Inter-medius, Vastus&#xD;
      Lateralis and Vastus Medialis were performed by two different researchers. Reliability&#xD;
      analysis of EI measurements were calculated with using intraclass correlation coefficient&#xD;
      (ICC), standard error of measurement (SEM) and coefficient of variation (CV) and Bland and&#xD;
      Altman plot analysis.&#xD;

    <description>Muscle echogenicity assessed by using ultrasound. Ultrasound assessment was performed on rectus femoris (RF), vastus intermedius (VI), vastus medialis (VM) and vastus lateralis (VL) muscles using with an ultrasound-imaging device (Philips Medical Systems EPIQ 5 Release 5.0.2, Amsterdam). Ultrasound Brightness mode (B-mode) with musculoskeletal scanning and a multi-frequency linear transducer (8-12 MHz, code: eL18-4) were used. For calculating echogenicity of muscles; all images obtained ultrasonography were analysed using the Image J software (Version 1.48v, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA) by two different analysers (five years and one-year of experience in US image analysis). The echogenicity results of the muscles performed by the two researchers recorded.</description>
