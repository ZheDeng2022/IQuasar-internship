  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer-related cognitive dysfunction (CRCD) affects up to 75% of patients receiving&#xD;
      chemotherapy and older adults are at greater risk of developing CRCD, which can negatively&#xD;
      affect their functional independence and quality of life. Memory and Attention Adaptation&#xD;
      Training (MAAT) is a promising treatment for CRCD that improves perceived cognition in&#xD;
      younger cancer survivors, but needs to be adapted for older adults to address their unique&#xD;
      needs. The proposed study will adapt MAAT for older adults using feedback from key&#xD;
      stakeholders (older adults with cancer and their caregivers), and subsequently test the&#xD;
      ability of MAAT to improve or maintain cognition for older adults with breast cancer&#xD;
      receiving adjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cancer-related cognitive dysfunction (CRCD) is a significant problem, affecting up to 75% of&#xD;
      patients receiving chemotherapy. Older adults are at greater risk of developing CRCD which&#xD;
      can negatively affect their functional independence and quality of life. Memory and Attention&#xD;
      Adaptation Training (MAAT) is a promising tool that improves perceived cognition in younger&#xD;
      cancer survivors with CRCD. For older adults with cancer, MAAT could be delivered alongside&#xD;
      chemotherapy to mitigate the development of CRCD (when risk is highest) and CRCD-related&#xD;
      effects on functional independence for older adults. However, MAAT will require adaptation to&#xD;
      meet the unique needs of older adults to optimize usability and efficacy for this population.&#xD;
      The overarching goal of this project is to adapt MAAT for older adults using input from&#xD;
      patient and caregiver stakeholders, and subsequently gather data on the preliminary effects&#xD;
      of the adapted MAAT (MAAT-Geriatrics [G]) on perceived cognition, objective cognitive&#xD;
      measures and functional independence. The investigators will adapt and refine MAAT-G using&#xD;
      feedback from key stakeholders through iterative testing of MAAT-G with 85 patient-caregiver&#xD;
      dyads. The research plan combines the use of standardized quantitative measures of cognition&#xD;
      and functional independence with semi-structured interviews (mixed methods), so that data&#xD;
      from both can be integrated to optimize the adaptation and to gain a better understanding of&#xD;
      MAAT-G's effects that are not fully captured by traditional quantitative measures alone.&#xD;

    <description>The CANTAB Delayed Matching to Sample assesses both simultaneous visual matching ability and short-term visual recognition memory, for non-verbalisable patterns. The subject is shown a complex visual pattern, followed by four similar patterns after a brief delay. The subject must select the pattern which exactly matches the sample.

    <description>Memory and Attention Adaptation Training (MAAT) is a cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)-based intervention for CRCD. As a CBT-based intervention, MAAT focuses on an individual's psychological response to injury as compared to the biological events triggering CRCD. MAAT is a series of manualized workshops delivered by a psychologist via video-conferencing, supplemented by a participant workbook, which provide instruction and practice with adaptive behavioral coping skills, stress management techniques, and compensation strategies.</description>
