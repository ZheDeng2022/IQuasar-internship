  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study sought to investigate the effects of 16/8 time restricted eating (TRE) with windows&#xD;
      of 16 hours of fasting and 8 hours of eating on on body composition, muscle strength, and&#xD;
      metabolic factors during resistance training in healthy resistance trained males&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thirty-four resistance-trained males were randomly assigned to a TRE group or to a control&#xD;
      normal pattern group (ND) with a traditional meal pattern. The TRE group consumed 100% of the&#xD;
      daily energy needs in an 8-hour time window: from 1PM (post meridiem) to 8:00 PM whilst the&#xD;
      ND group consumed 100% of their daily energy needs in 3 meals between 8:00 AM (ante meridiem)&#xD;
      and 8:00 PM. During the experimental period, training loads were similar and standardize in&#xD;
      the two groups. partecipants were tested before and after 8 weeks of the intervention. Body&#xD;
      composition , basal metabolism, performances indexes and blood parameters were measured.&#xD;
      After the completition of the first two months of study, subjects were ask to volunteer to&#xD;
      continue the intervention for 10 extra months. A total of twenty subjects from, 10 from each&#xD;
      group (TRE or ND) continued and completed the second part of the study.&#xD;
