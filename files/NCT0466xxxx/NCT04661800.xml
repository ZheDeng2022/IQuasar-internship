  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Amyloidosis is a disease caused by the continuous accumulation of fibrillary proteins in the&#xD;
      extracellular matrix causing the architecture of different organs to be disrupted. The&#xD;
      prevalence of the disease increases with age. The two most common forms are light chain&#xD;
      amyloidosis (AL) and transthyretin (TTR). TTR amyloidosis may be hereditary (m-TTR, or&#xD;
      mutated) or age-related (WT-TTR, or wild). The latter is also called senile amyloidosis. In&#xD;
      all these forms, cardiac impairment is common and leads the patient to consult/or be referred&#xD;
      to a cardiological center unfortunately often too late when the prognosis is directly related&#xD;
      to the severity of the heart attack. The description/discovery of clinical signs prior to&#xD;
      heart disease is important to improve the detection and diagnosis of early forms of cardiac&#xD;
      amyloidosis (CA). For example, an infiltration of the carpal tunnel synovial by amyloid&#xD;
      deposits is observed in some patients, 5 years before the onset of signs of heart failure and&#xD;
      is the only warning sign of the disease known to date. We also showed in a previous study&#xD;
      that patients had more severe and earlier impairment of hearing function than expected by age&#xD;
      and gender.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective The main objective is to define the prevalence and severity of smell and taste&#xD;
      disorders in a population of patients with cardiac amyloidosis (3 types of mutated or wild AL&#xD;
      amyloidosis and TTR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main endpoint is to determine the number of patients with impaired smell and taste's&#xD;
      functions in a population of patients diagnosed with cardiac amyloidosis (3 types of mutated&#xD;
      (hereditary) or senile wild amyloidosis (3 types of AL amyloidosis and TTR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method Successive monocentric cross-sectional study on the screening of smell and taste&#xD;
      disorders carried out as part of a cardiology hospitalization programmed for the cardiology&#xD;
      follow-up of his pathology in a population of patients diagnosed with AC.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Model description: Successive monocentric cross-sectional study on the screening of smell and taste disorders carried out as part of a cardiology hospitalization programmed for the cardiology follow-up of his pathology in a population of patients diagnosed with AC. All subjects will have an ENT check-up including: an ENT examination with a nasal endoscopy, an evaluation of the olfactory function by Sniffin's stick tests (test which consists of smelling smelling pens) an evaluation of taste (test which consists of discriminating between acid, bitter, sweet and salty using blotting papers placed on the tongue). Nutritional status will be assessed by a mini-questionnaire, measurement of weight, brachial circumference and tricipital skin fold, calculation of body mass index (BMI), orosomucoid dosage.</intervention_model_description>
