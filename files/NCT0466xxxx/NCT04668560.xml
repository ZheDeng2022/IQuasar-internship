  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Norway and other Western industrialized countries are facing major challenges in terms of&#xD;
      preventable health problems, high work absence, largescale demographic changes and rising&#xD;
      social inequalities in health. By applying an interdisciplinary research approach -&#xD;
      integrating perspectives from psychology, sociology, medicine and economics, using multiple&#xD;
      samples and complementary analytical strategies, this project addresses the need for&#xD;
      effective means to meet these important challenges. The project will scientifically evaluate&#xD;
      The 5 Ways to Wellbeing course (5Ways), a novel measure aiming to promote wellbeing and&#xD;
      integration, health and work adherence. Subjective wellbeing is systematically and&#xD;
      prospectively related to important individual and societal outcomes, including social&#xD;
      connectedness and integration, innovation, productivity, work performance, healthy&#xD;
      behaviours, health and longevity. Promotion of wellbeing may therefore contribute to address&#xD;
      the urgent societal ailments of today. Intervention effects and cost effectiveness of the&#xD;
      5Ways will be examined in-depth in four real-life settings, using quantitative and&#xD;
      qualitative methods. Specifically, we will investigate course impact on i) sickness absence&#xD;
      for employees in work places with high sickness absence rates, ii) wellbeing, health and&#xD;
      social participation among immigrants attending the municipalities? Introduction Programmes,&#xD;
      and iii) wellbeing, health and work adherence among users of The Norwegian Labour and Welfare&#xD;
      Administration (NAV) and iv) clients in Healthy Life Centres. If effective, the course may be&#xD;
      implemented nationwide and contribute to increase wellbeing and work participation and reduce&#xD;
      immigrants? exclusion. Findings from the study may thus contribute to enable municipalities&#xD;
      and workplaces to make better priorities for promoting work presence, reducing suffering and&#xD;
      improving mastery and quality of life among their employees and inhabitants&#xD;

      Sample:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample consists of individuals attending the 5Ways course offered in Healthy Life Centres&#xD;
      HLCs (N=600) and in NAV centres (N=120), and two groups of control subjects. The control&#xD;
      groups include i) 1200 individuals participating in the FLS study and ii) 120 individuals in&#xD;
      NAV receiving follow up as usual. The target group for the 5Ways course consists of&#xD;
      individuals with, or at high risk of disease, who need support in health behaviour change and&#xD;
      in coping with health problems and chronic disease. HLCs are interdisciplinary primary health&#xD;
      care services that offer effective measures for people who need support in health behaviour&#xD;
      change and in coping with health problems and chronic disease. All 5Ways course participants&#xD;
      in HLCs will be invited to enrol in the study. In total, the investigators estimate that at&#xD;
      least 30 HLCs will participate in the study and offer the 5Ways course in 2021. Given a&#xD;
      minimum of two courses per year per HLC, the investigators assume that altogether 600&#xD;
      participants from HLCs will be included in the study in 2021. The second group of course&#xD;
      participants will include individuals on sick leave, work assessment allowance and disability&#xD;
      pension who receive the 5Ways course through NAV. NAV currently administers a third of the&#xD;
      national budget through schemes such as unemployment benefit, work assessment allowance,&#xD;
      pensions, etc. The NAV participants will be randomised into an intervention group or a&#xD;
      control group. Exclusion criteria for participation in the course include impaired cognitive&#xD;
      functioning and severe mental illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Course Intervention. The participants will attend the course for 2.5 hours across six&#xD;
      weeks, one session dedicated to each of the five actions, and the last session for&#xD;
      summarising, sharing and evaluating. The course is ready to be implemented. The course&#xD;
      leaders are HLC coaches and NAV employees, with a minimum of three years of relevant&#xD;
      education who are certified to run the 5Ways course. Course leader training consists of a&#xD;
      two-day intensive, highly standardized training program. All course leaders receive a&#xD;
      comprehensive manual to be followed through the course. The participants receive standardised&#xD;
      course material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Pilot Study. During spring 2018, a pilot study was conducted on the 5Ways course in 12&#xD;
      HLCs in the South-Eastern part of Norway. A total of 89 participants completed the evaluation&#xD;
      questionnaire. The evaluation report concluded that the participants were highly satisfied&#xD;
      (score: 8.7/10), intended to continue to practice what they had learnt and experienced&#xD;
      improved wellbeing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research hypotheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that participating in the 5Ways course will improve wellbeing,&#xD;
      physical and mental health, mastery and social participation, and thus ultimately reduce the&#xD;
      burden of disease, reduce utilisation of health care services, and increase work&#xD;
      participation. The investigators will examine effects on all outcome measures in different&#xD;
      vulnerable groups short term, after completion of the course, and long term, after 15 months,&#xD;
      on participants in HLCs and users on welfare benefits in the NAV system. The investigators&#xD;
      have three main hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The 5Ways course improves wellbeing, physical and mental health and mastery, short term&#xD;
           and long term.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The 5Ways course reduces loneliness, strengthens social integration, and increases&#xD;
           social support, short term and long term.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The 5Ways course increases return to work and long-term work participation in&#xD;
           individuals on sick leave or welfare benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design. The design is a prospective controlled comparative study, using two different groups,&#xD;
      with and without randomisation. Group 1: Participants referred to HLCs, and group 2:&#xD;
      Individuals receiving welfare benefits from The Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration&#xD;
      (NAV). The long-term results from group 1 will be compared to a group of HLC users not&#xD;
      offered the course (i.e., participating in the ongoing FLS-study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomised controlled trial (RCT) was originally planned for both HLCs and NAV. However,&#xD;
      both end users and HLC coaches urged the investigators to avoid randomisation in HLCs. HLC&#xD;
      participants often need to build up the courage to seek help over time. Randomisation to&#xD;
      no/delayed course (e.g., waiting list control) was therefore considered unethical. In NAV,&#xD;
      the users have not requested health care services. Hence, not being offered the course is&#xD;
      &quot;treatment as usual&quot;. By conducting a study in NAV, the project meets the gold standard of&#xD;
      using a RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1. Participants referred to HLCs, receiving regular HLC services, will be offered the&#xD;
      course and invited to participate in the study. The HLC coaches will be responsible for the&#xD;
      recruitment of course participants. Control for group 1. A large-scale study on effects of&#xD;
      participation in HLCs, the FLS-study (Frisklivsstudien, N=1200) is about to be completed. The&#xD;
      FLS participants are similar to our group 1 in terms of characteristics. The FLS study also&#xD;
      include some of the outcome measures to be used in our planned study. The FLS data thus give&#xD;
      the investigators the opportunity to compare the 5Ways course with effects of basic HLC&#xD;
      interventions (i.e., 12 weeks follow-up of health behaviour change by a HLC coach). Group 2.&#xD;
      People on welfare benefits, such as long-term sick leave and disability pensions, in the&#xD;
      NAV-system will be recruited by NAV employees and randomised into two groups, an intervention&#xD;
      group and a control group. The intervention group will participate in the course, and the&#xD;
      control group will be followed up as usual in NAV (i.e., not offered the course). In groups 1&#xD;
      and 2 the participants will receive the questionnaire at the start of the course, at the end&#xD;
      of the course, at 6 months and at 15 months. Four measurement waves enable the investigators&#xD;
      to model long-term changes in the outcome variables after the intervention using multilevel&#xD;
      methods, as this requires at least three measurements in the follow up phase. Although one&#xD;
      would expect some dropout, all the available data will be useful in this approach, as it does&#xD;
      not require listwise deletion of individuals with missing data. There will be approximately&#xD;
      70 courses altogether, 60 in HLCs and 10 in NAV. This will allow the investigators to&#xD;
      investigate the extent to which course effects and the subsequent developmental trajectories&#xD;
      in participants differ between groups. The investigators can also account for this&#xD;
      variability by including level two predictors, such as the course leaders' fidelity to the&#xD;
      manual. Follow-up data collected after 15 months will be compared to the 15 months' follow-up&#xD;
      data in the FLS study. This design enables the investigators to examine potential effects in&#xD;
      two ways: 1. Examine the added effect of the 5Ways course to ordinary HLC services at 15&#xD;
      months. 2. Examine the effect of the course in a group of individuals on welfare benefits&#xD;
      compared to a control group in NAV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instruments. Subjective wellbeing is the primary outcome in this study. Secondary outcome&#xD;
      measures are physical and mental health, mastery, social integration, physical activity, use&#xD;
      of health care services and work adherence. Measurement tools in the recent report on&#xD;
      recommendations for a better quality of life measurement system, will be used. These include&#xD;
      OECD's recommended minimum-tool for assessing quality of life, Diener's flourishing scale,&#xD;
      Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS), Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS),&#xD;
      Pearlin and Schoolers Mastery Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2), Oslo Social&#xD;
      Support Scale (OSS-3) and Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL). In addition, the investigators&#xD;
      will use The Short Form Survey-12 (SF-12) and standardised questions on physical activity&#xD;
      from the North-Trøndelag Health Survey (HUNT). The latter questions are used in the&#xD;
      FLS-study. Background data such as age, gender, education, work attachment, economy and&#xD;
      relationship status will also be collected. Three user representatives have tested the&#xD;
      questionnaire, and provided useful feedback resulting in minor revisions. Procedure. The&#xD;
      study participants will fill in the questionnaire on the first and last course sessions. For&#xD;
      the 6 and 15 months' follow-up, the participants will receive a SMS with a link to a common&#xD;
      web page where the questionnaires may be completed. Digital data collection makes it easier&#xD;
      to complete the questionnaires and ease the computing processes. The project will use&#xD;
      external data management services that will program and test the digitalisation of the&#xD;
      questionnaire. The data will be transferred into data files ready for use by the PhD&#xD;
      candidate. Price estimates have been provided by suppliers of such services, and services&#xD;
      will be acquired in line with public procurement policies. The PhD candidate will be in&#xD;
      regular contact with the data management company and with HLC and NAV course leaders via&#xD;
      email and telephone, ensuring timing of the SMSes to the measurement times. The PhD candidate&#xD;
      will introduce the course leaders to the study during their two-day course leader training in&#xD;
      2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis. The effect analysis of the primary outcome will involve a comparison of&#xD;
      self-reported wellbeing at course start and course end, using a two-way repeated (mixed)&#xD;
      measures ANOVA. Additionally, longitudinal analyses will be conducted by fitting linear mixed&#xD;
      (multilevel) models to data from all five time points. Mixed modelling is flexible and can&#xD;
      handle non-balanced data with missing entries and repeated observations. The models allow the&#xD;
      investigators to examine the effectiveness of the intervention and test hypotheses about&#xD;
      group and individual trajectories in wellbeing, while controlling for both time variant and&#xD;
      invariant covariates. Follow-up analyses will be conducted using various time-to-event&#xD;
      approaches. Analyses will be performed in SPSS 25.0 (SPSS I, 2017) and R 3.5.3 (R Core Team&#xD;
      2019). Sample size and power. Simulations were performed in R 3.5.3 to assess power to detect&#xD;
      an increase in wellbeing of 4.3 units from a baseline score of 12.5, the magnitude found in&#xD;
      the pilot study, for each of the two subsamples (n=600 and n= 120) in both intervention and&#xD;
      control groups, (sd=5, rho=0.5). Power to detect an interaction effect in mixed ANOVA (two&#xD;
      tailed test, α=0.05) was found to be 1.0 (HLCs) and 1.0 (NAV), which is adequate, also&#xD;
      allowing for dropout of 17 %. Although dropout is expected to increase for the later&#xD;
      measurements, the multilevel analysis ensures utilisation of all available data. Power is&#xD;
      higher in the linear mixed models, with data from additional three time points included for&#xD;
      each participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dissemination plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dissemination plan will be the key tool to make the project findings available and&#xD;
      relevant to the main stakeholders (users and staff), private, ideal and governmental users,&#xD;
      the scientific community, and the media. The NCMH, core scientists and user groups will be&#xD;
      actively involved in dissemination of all findings. Results from the project will be&#xD;
      published in high quality open access international peer reviewed journals. Tentative titles&#xD;
      of papers:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The 5 Ways to Wellbeing course: The effects on wellbeing, physical and mental health and&#xD;
           mastery. A randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Reducing loneliness and improving social integration and social support: The long-term&#xD;
           impact of the 5 Ways to Wellbeing course.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Effects of the 5 Ways to Wellbeing course on work participation in adults on sick leave&#xD;
           and welfare benefits in The Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration (NAV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, results from the project will be published in condensed form accessible to both&#xD;
      professionals and non-professionals by several means of dissemination. These include national&#xD;
      conferences (e.g., HLC network conferences), Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH)&#xD;
      reports and newsletters, press releases for each scientific paper, and activity in social&#xD;
      media.&#xD;
