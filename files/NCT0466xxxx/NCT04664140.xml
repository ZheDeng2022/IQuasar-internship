    <textblock>
      A significant portion of patients continue to experience both adverse events and symptoms&#xD;
      after angiographically successful PCI. Beyond different underlying mechanisms non-related to&#xD;
      epicardial disease (vasospasm, microcirculatory dysfunction), several recent studies have&#xD;
      shown that in at least 15-20% of PCIs, a prognostically meaningful ischemia, detected with&#xD;
      different coronary physiology tools, is present at the end of a successful angiography-guided&#xD;
      PCI. In addition, physiology is able to discriminate the underlying reason causing the&#xD;
      suboptimal functional result, namely: i) in-stent drop; ii) focal drop outside stent; iii)&#xD;
      diffuse disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the use of post-PCI physiology is still very low, even when it is utilized pre-PCI&#xD;
      to set the indication for stenting. Lack of dedicated randomized clinical trials and&#xD;
      procedural lengthening and increase in side effects are at the basis of this&#xD;
      underutilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the ideal tool should allow to plan the intervention in advance rather than to&#xD;
      assess the results afterwards. To this hand, QFR is particularly appealing, among available&#xD;
      physiology tools, because it does not need wire or adenosine and allows: i) identification of&#xD;
      disease mechanism; ii) co-registration with angiography; iii) pre-PCI planning with residual&#xD;
      vessel QFR value according to a pre-specified treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taken all this characteristics together, QFR is the ideal technology for virtual PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of the present investigation is that a procedural planning based on QFR&#xD;
      (virtual PCI) is able to reduce the rate of patients with post-PCI suboptimal functional&#xD;
      result, that has been found to correlate with prognosis in our earlier study, if compared to&#xD;
      the traditional angio-guided PCI.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Post-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) physiology The results of functional assessment&#xD;
      performed after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) taught us that a &quot;successful&quot;&#xD;
      angiography-guided PCI is often suboptimal in terms of physiology and that physiology result&#xD;
      after PCI is closely linked to outcome. Yet, post-PCI physiology is rarely utilized in&#xD;
      clinical practice, being employed in less than 10% of lesions investigated with physiology&#xD;
      pre-PCI. Reasons for the low use of functional assessment post-PCI and for subsequent&#xD;
      intervention are manifold. First, physiology is actually used after PCI only in cases where&#xD;
      it was utilized pre-PCI. Second, randomized clinical trials (RCT) addressing the use of&#xD;
      physiology to assess PCI results have not been performed, therefore clear instructions and&#xD;
      cutoffs for its use are lacking. Third, when fractional flow reserve (FFR) is measured, the&#xD;
      need to administer adenosine several times during the same procedure results in increased&#xD;
      procedure time, cost and adverse side effects. Fourth, in case of a post-PCI suboptimal&#xD;
      functional result, it may be difficult to ascertain the underlying cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New indices and tools have been developed in an effort to overcome barriers to the widespread&#xD;
      adoption of functional assessment. Non-hyperaemic pressure indices (NHPI) including, resting&#xD;
      distal to aortic coronary pressure ratio (Pd/Pa), and other resting indices have enabled&#xD;
      functional evaluation without pharmacological arteriolar vasodilation, while&#xD;
      angiography-based functional assessment have eliminated the need for a dedicated pressure&#xD;
      wire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importantly, these newer tools may allow operators to understand the mechanism underlying an&#xD;
      abnormal physiology value after angiographically successful intervention. In fact, the real&#xD;
      novelty related to their development is the shift from a binary interpretation of physiology&#xD;
      (positive/negative) to a quantitative site-specific one. For these reasons, they are&#xD;
      extremely appealing post-PCI and several studies have been recently conducted to validate&#xD;
      them in this setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative flow ratio (QFR) In particular, quantitative flow ratio (QFR) is an&#xD;
      angiographically-derived estimate of FFR developed as an alternative to wire-based&#xD;
      intracoronary physiology. One advantage of angio-based FFR systems is allowing the generation&#xD;
      of a pullback curve and discrimination of the physiological contribution of each single&#xD;
      lesion as well as diagnosis of diffuse disease. The value of QFR to assess the functional&#xD;
      results of PCI has been tested in the prospective Angio-Based Fractional Flow Reserve to&#xD;
      Predict Adverse Events After Stent Implantation (HAWKEYE) study. Seven hundred fifty-one&#xD;
      vessels in 602 patients undergoing angiographically satisfactory second-generation drug&#xD;
      eluting stent (DES) implantation were analyzed. At the end of the procedure, the operator&#xD;
      acquired projections for QFR computation performed offline by an independent core laboratory.&#xD;
      Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis identified a post-PCI QFR best cut-off&#xD;
      of &lt;0.90 (area under the curve 0.77; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.74-0.80; p&lt; 0.001).&#xD;
      After correction for potential confounding factors, post-PCI QFR&lt;0.90 was associated with a&#xD;
      3-fold increase in risk for the vessel-oriented composite endpoint at 2 years (HR: 2.91; 95%&#xD;
      CI 1.63-5.19; p&lt; 0.001). Further, a very important finding of the HAWKEYE study was the&#xD;
      demonstration that QFR could discriminate among different coronary artery disease (CAD)&#xD;
      patterns. In vessels with suboptimal functional result, the site of the QFR drop was in-stent&#xD;
      in 13% of the cases, while a focal drop outside the stent was identifiable in 32% of the&#xD;
      cases. Thirty-four percent of vessels showed diffuse disease, while in 21% a combination of&#xD;
      the aforementioned possibilities was present. It is important to note that QFR analyzability&#xD;
      depends on quality of angiography and it is feasible in around 80% of the cases. Moreover,&#xD;
      QFR is not applicable in specific lesion subsets such as left main, bifurcation and ostial&#xD;
      lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Virtual PCI The inherent limit of post-PCI physiology is to add measurement and consequent&#xD;
      actions after the end of a procedure that has been deemed successful by the same operator who&#xD;
      is performing it. In addition, it is associated with the increase in procedural time and&#xD;
      costs. Thus, a broad application of post-PCI physiology, although clinically meaningful, is&#xD;
      implausible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the contrary, the systematic application of QFR before stenting to simulate PCI results&#xD;
      according to different treatment strategies (virtual PCI) would be an interesting alternative&#xD;
      to achieve a fully physiology guided procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The advantages of a virtual PCI strategy based on QFR application are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  QFR is a simple tool, based on what the operator already performs before PCI (namely two&#xD;
           perpendicular angiographic projections) and not requiring wire or adenosine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It enables to obtain a full physiologic map of the vessel with a point-by-point detailed&#xD;
           information of the functional impact of a given stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is possible to simulate the treatment of one or more lesions (virtual PCI) in order&#xD;
           to estimate the final functional value post-PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, virtual PCI based on QFR utilization would not increase procedural time or costs and&#xD;
      could obtain an optimal post-PCI physiology result in most cases. The &quot;Angio-based&#xD;
      Quantitative flow ratio Virtual PCI versus Conventional Angio-guided PCI in the achievement&#xD;
      of an optimal post-PCI QFR&quot; (AQVA) trial is the first step toward this direction and will be&#xD;
      the basis for a bigger study focused on hard clinical endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The rate of lesions with a final post-PCI QFR≥0.90 in patients treated with the QFR&#xD;
           virtual PCI versus patients treated with an angiography-based PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The rate of vessel-oriented composite endpoint (VOCE), defined as the composite of&#xD;
           vessel-related cardiovascular death, vessel-related myocardial infarction (MI), and&#xD;
           ischemia-driven target vessel revascularization (TVR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the HAWKEYE trial population, 16% of lesions presented a post-PCI QFR &lt;0.90 after an&#xD;
      angio-guided PCI. In one third of these lesions, low post-PCI QFR was due to diffuse disease.&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators hypothesize that a procedural plan with QFR could be able to&#xD;
      reduce the rate of lesions with QFR&lt;0.90 by two thirds. Considering that some of the lesions&#xD;
      with focal disease could also present diffuse disease, the investigators can realistically&#xD;
      estimate a reduction by 60% with virtual-PCI. Therefore, 300 patients are required to have a&#xD;
      80% chance of detecting, as significant at the 5% level, an increase in the percentage of&#xD;
      patient achieving a post-PCI QFR≥0.90 from 84% in the angio-guided group to 94% in the&#xD;
      virtual PCI group.&#xD;

    <description>Before starting PCI, the operator must acquire QFR angiographic projections after nitroglycerin administration at 15 frames/second. Angiographic projections should be at least 25 apart, aiming for minimal vessel foreshortening and minimal vessel overlap. In agreement with previous studies, operators follow a table of recommended projection angles. Afterwards, online QFR analysis must be performed. The tool &quot;residual vessel QFR&quot; should be used to anticipate the result of stenting (virtual PCI) by placing the proximal (p) and distal (d) marker in order to obtain a post-PCI QFR ≥0.90. then, the operator has to implant one or more stents following the pre-PCI plan and utilizing the QFR and angio to place the stent(s) according to the virtual PCI plan. Post-dilation with non-compliant (NC) balloon is strongly suggested. Blinded QFR projections must be obtained after PCI.</description>
