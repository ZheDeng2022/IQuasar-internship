    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, open-label, propofol-controlled exploratory clinical&#xD;
      study. In this study, 20 ICU patients undergoing mechanical ventilation are expected to be&#xD;
      enrolled and will be randomly assigned to the HSK3486 group and the propofol group in a 1:1&#xD;
      ratio. This study is not blinded as it is open-label.&#xD;
