  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For drivers with Parkinson's Disease (PD), autonomous in-vehicle technologies may help&#xD;
      mitigate functional deficits, improve driving performance, decrease driving errors and&#xD;
      enhance their ability to stay on the road. Using a pretest/posttest design the investigators&#xD;
      will quantify the use of In-vehicle Information Systems (IVIS) and Advanced Driver Assistance&#xD;
      Systems (ADAS) during driving to illustrate how IVIS and ADAS may affect driving, and provide&#xD;
      recommendations to drivers with PD, the clinical community and industry.&#xD;

    <description>Each driver will drive on-road, everybody will be exposed to two drives (Drive 1, Drive 2) one drive with and the other without in-vehicle technology. The order of technology (with vs. without IVIS or ADAS) and the order of the routes (Drive 1 vs. Drive 2) will be randomly allocated to control for order effects.</description>

    <description>All drives will include events to assess the impact of in-vehicle information systems (IVIS) and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) on the driving performance (driving errors) of drivers with PD. For IVIS the investigators will include options to assess errors with lane maintenance (with and without the lane departure warning system) and signaling (with and without blind spot detection). For ADAS the investigators will include conditions to assess errors in speeding (with and without adaptive cruise control) and lane exceedances (with and without lane keeping assist).</description>
