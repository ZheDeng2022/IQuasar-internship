  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Early Detection Initiative for Pancreatic Cancer is a multi-center randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial to determine if algorithm-based screening in patients with new onset hyperglycemia and&#xD;
      diabetes can result in earlier detection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Early Detection Initiative (EDI), is designed to evaluate if imaging at the time of new&#xD;
      onset hyperglycemia and diabetes, especially at its earliest discovery through passive&#xD;
      surveillance of the electronic medical record (EMR), results in earlier detection of&#xD;
      pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients are identified and enrolled based on a first-time elevation in fasting&#xD;
      blood glucose or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) to the level indicating diabetes as derived from&#xD;
      records in their EMR. All enrolled patients are randomized to either the Observational Arm or&#xD;
      Intervention Arm of the study. Patients randomized to the Intervention Arm have Enriching&#xD;
      New-onset Diabetes for Pancreatic Cancer (ENDPAC) score calculated using age, body weight and&#xD;
      glucose or glycated hemoglobin values in their EMR. Patients with high ENDPAC score (&gt;0) are&#xD;
      approached for informed consent to participate in up to two imaging studies by computerized&#xD;
      tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In addition to imaging,&#xD;
      participants will be asked to complete study questionnaires and participate in serial blood&#xD;
      collection at up to five time points. Blood samples collected in the EDI study will&#xD;
      contribute to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Cancer Institute (NCI)&#xD;
      biorepository located at the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research facility.&#xD;
      Patients in both study arms are followed for development of PDAC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is performed at locations with broad (institutional) consent for use of patient&#xD;
      EMR information for research studies. Passive follow-up by EMR will occur for five years&#xD;
      following enrollment. Any patient that has declined participation in EMR-based research at&#xD;
      the institution is not included in the study.&#xD;
