  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of using the Exablate&#xD;
      Type 2 system using microbubble resonators (Exablate Test Arm) to disrupt the Blood-Brain&#xD;
      Barrier for the purpose of temporarily transforming, and thereby 'marking', regions of&#xD;
      infiltrating gliomas prior to planned surgical resection, for the purpose of improving tumor&#xD;
      visualization during the surgery to achieve a greater proportion of subjects who receive a&#xD;
      GTR per plan compared to those not undergoing a BBBD procedure prior to resection (Control&#xD;
      Arm).&#xD;

      After being informed about the study and potential risks, all patients giving written&#xD;
      informed consent will undergo screening to determine eligibility for study entry. Patients&#xD;
      who meet the eligibility requirements will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to Exablate Test Arm&#xD;
      and to Control Arm, respectively. The following assessments will occur:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pre-surgical planning and Post-surgical visit MRI exams with and without contrast will&#xD;
           be collected for evaluation by the study core lab; Any return to surgery for additional&#xD;
           resection will be captured&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. All subjects will be seen at ~Week 2, and ~4-Weeks post resection for physical and&#xD;
           neurological exams and to assess for complications or adverse events. These visits&#xD;
           should coincide with standard (Neuro-oncology) care following resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Long-term outcomes will be collected during standard of care Neuro-oncology care&#xD;
           follow-up visits for up to 2 years post resection; standard of care MRIs and RANO&#xD;
           assessments will be collected.&#xD;
