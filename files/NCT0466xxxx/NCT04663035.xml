  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled, phase 2 study to assess the efficacy and safety of ablation&#xD;
      followed by tislelizumab versus ablation alone in patients with early recurrent&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ablation is one of the main treatments for early recurrent HCC, and its immune stimulation is&#xD;
      expected to improve the efficacy of anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.&#xD;
      Tislelizumab is a new immunotherapy agent with independent intellectual property rights in&#xD;
      China, which is highly efficient and safe. It is of great value to combine Tislelizumab with&#xD;
      ablation to reduce the risk of recurrence in HCC patients. In this study, early-stage HCC&#xD;
      patients with high risk of recurrence would be included and randomly assigned to receive&#xD;
      ablation plus Tislelizumab or ablation alone. The tumor recurrence, overall survival and&#xD;
      safety would be observed and recorded to analyze whether Tislelizumab can reduce the&#xD;
      recurrence rate.&#xD;

The ablation electrode is a unipolar needle with a bare end of 2 or 3 cm (adjusted to tumor size). The ablation power is 150 watts (range from 100 to 200 watts). In general, the average ablation time for each lesion is about 12 minutes (ranging from 10 to 15 minutes).</description>
