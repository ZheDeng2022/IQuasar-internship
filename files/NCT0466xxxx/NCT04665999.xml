    <textblock>
      This is an observational study. Forty females with type 1 diabetes (age 18-40) using a&#xD;
      continuous glucose monitor and an insulin pump will be enrolled for a 3-month data&#xD;
      collection. Study participants will include free-cycling females and females following oral&#xD;
      contraceptive therapy. All study appointments may be completed virtually.&#xD;

      Females, age 18-40 y.o., diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and currently using an insulin pump,&#xD;
      will be provided a study continuous glucose monitor (CGM) in order to collect 3 full&#xD;
      menstrual cycle data within 180 days. Enrollment may last from 3-5 months. Study participants&#xD;
      will include free-cycling females and females following oral contraceptive therapy. Study&#xD;
      CGMs and activity trackers will be provided for the entire data collection period. During&#xD;
      data collection, all participants will be asked to record meals consumed and free-cycling&#xD;
      females will be asked to confirm ovulation by means of study-provided ovulation kits. The&#xD;
      Clue app will be recommended to study participants to record dates of beginning of menses and&#xD;
      ovulation (if applicable).&#xD;

    <description>Continuous glucose monitor (CGM) data will be collected for three (3) full menstrual cycles. At the end of data collection, data will be analyzed to track insulin sensitivity and glycemic variability changes across the menstrual cycle. Participants will be asked to record meals consumed and free-cycling females will be asked to confirm ovulation by means of study-provided ovulation kits. Participants will be asked to record dates of beginning of menses and ovulation. Participants will also be provide an activity tracker to wear during the duration of the trial.</description>
