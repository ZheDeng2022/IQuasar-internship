    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of an eight-week specific Core Stability&#xD;
      Training (CST) on young rhythmic gymnasts. The literature suggests CST may help improve sport&#xD;
      performance, however, more studies implementing functional CST and accurate methodology are&#xD;
      needed to validate this statement. Little is known about Core Stability (CS) and Rhythmic&#xD;
      Gymnastics (RG). The study intends to find out whether CST contributes to the Rhythmic&#xD;
      gymnasts core stability, balances and jumps execution enhancement, very important RG&#xD;
      performance determinants. It is hypothesized the rhythmic gymnasts will increase their CS,&#xD;
      balances and jumps performance once the specific CST is conducted.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gymnasts were recruited from the Gymnastics Club &quot;Gimnàstica Muntanyenc&quot;. All participants&#xD;
      were rhythmic gymnasts who had at least two-year experience competing in RG at regional&#xD;
      federated and school competition level and trained three times per week. Individuals who&#xD;
      didn't meet these criteria or were injured at the moment were excluded. The participants were&#xD;
      invited to take part in the study voluntarily, and along with their parents were informed&#xD;
      verbally and in writing as to the characteristics of the program. Parents or legal guardians&#xD;
      signed informed consent forms, and a document that explained the objectives and planned&#xD;
      activities of the provided program. The study was approved by the FPCEE Blanquerna Research&#xD;
      Ethics Committee. All protocols applied in this research (including the management of the&#xD;
      personal data of the participants) complied with the requirements specified in the&#xD;
      Declaration of Helsinki of 1975 and its subsequent revisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific CST program is aimed for Rhythmic gymnasts between 8 and 15 years of age who&#xD;
      train in the competitive group and their goal is to improve their RG level. All the study&#xD;
      participants were asked to sign an informed consent document that was drafted in keeping with&#xD;
      all applicable research ethics protocols, including a guarantee of the confidentiality of&#xD;
      personal data and an assurance that participants can choose to abandon the study at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group (CG), experimental group (EG) and pre-test, post-test methodology was selected.&#xD;
      EG performed the specific CST while CG carried out the traditional RG training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CST intervention had been carried out over the course of one academic year (2018-19). The&#xD;
      first 3 months allowed investigators to recruit the participants and design the CST adapted&#xD;
      to the Rhythmic gymnasts and pursuing the highest specificity for the CS exercises. This&#xD;
      design took into account prior experiences of a CS physiotherapist expert and a RG national&#xD;
      coach. The load of the sessions was controlled according to a Rate of Perceived Exertion&#xD;
      (RPE) scale, a valid method of quantifying exercise training during a wide variety of types&#xD;
      of exercise. A training protocol trial will be applied where the subjects will be asked to&#xD;
      point out which is their perceived exercise intensity, thirty minutes after the training&#xD;
      ends. The repetitions will be adjusted to the 7-8 RPE scale values (very hard) allowing the&#xD;
      correct execution of the exercises to the participants and yet permitting adaptations&#xD;
      produced by the training. The conclusions drawn from this initial experience formed the&#xD;
      scientific basis for the definitive version of the CST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the fourth month a pre-test was carried out including an anthropometric study of the&#xD;
      gymnasts, three CS tests, seven balance tests and six jump tests. The participants warmed up&#xD;
      before each test except for the anthropometric study and the order of the subjects and the&#xD;
      order of the applied tests were randomly determined using a true random number generator to&#xD;
      avoid order effects. A group blinded specialized physiotherapist conducted the anthropometric&#xD;
      study and the CS tests, and a group blinded RG expert led the rest of the tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CS tests: Two pressure biofeedback unit (PBU) tests were applied to evaluate the lumbopelvic&#xD;
      motor control (LPMC) and the pelvic tilt tests were conducted to evaluate CS endurance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Balance tests: One leg stand test (OLST) was performed on a force platform to evaluate the&#xD;
      gymnasts' balance. Right and left and open and closed eyes conditions were used to perform&#xD;
      the four Romberg variants balance tests. Three specific Rhythmic balances were chosen to&#xD;
      execute over the force platform and were also evaluated by three RG judge experts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Jump Tests: Counter movement jump (CMJ) and single leg countermovement jump (SLCMJ) were&#xD;
      performed on a force platform to assess the gymnasts' jump. Three specific RG jumps outside&#xD;
      the force platform were evaluated by three RG judge experts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric study: A complete anthropometric study was carried out by a professional&#xD;
      physiotherapist and will allow the investigators to verify the results are not affected by&#xD;
      group initial differences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From February to April the eight-week CST sessions were offered in the gymnasts' regular&#xD;
      training space suitable for the intervention exercises and guaranteeing the safety of the&#xD;
      participants. The investigators provided all the extra equipment required for the study. The&#xD;
      EG participants performed the CST 3 times per week at the same time of their scheduled&#xD;
      training. The duration of the specific training was approximately 30 minutes for 8 weeks with&#xD;
      a total of 24 sessions. EG gymnasts were observed while performing the exercises to ensure&#xD;
      the training was performed correctly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty minutes after every CST session all gymnasts (EG and CG) were asked to pick the score&#xD;
      of the RPE scale that best described their sensation. This score, multiplied by the minutes&#xD;
      of the session (RPE session), helped us modulate the training periodization plan. The average&#xD;
      RPE session values were calculated to ensure no load training differences existed among&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This CST program involves exercises that challenge the balance, postural control and&#xD;
      explosive strength of the gymnasts, executed with specific RG elements and postures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific CST training contains three blocks; a circuit, plyometric exercises and CS&#xD;
      exercises. Three different balances and leaps very common in RG (novice to intermediate&#xD;
      competitive level) were selected to convert the core and the explosive strength exercises&#xD;
      into a very specific and functional training. The balances selected were the passé balance,&#xD;
      the side balance with help and the arabesque, the three leaps were the scissors, the stag&#xD;
      from assemble and the split leap. The mentioned RG elements were selected due to their lower&#xD;
      limb position planes variety and different techniques since it is advised that a range of&#xD;
      exercises should be performed to challenge the core musculature in all three planes and&#xD;
      ranges of movement to develop total CS. Moreover, all exercises were executed equitably for&#xD;
      the right and left side. Unstable superficies as the Bossu, unstable discs and soft balls&#xD;
      were included to perform core and balance exercises. The gymnasts performed 3 exercises of&#xD;
      the circuit on an unstable surface. It is reported, when standing on an unstable support, the&#xD;
      stabilizing muscles make anticipatory adjustments subsequently minimizing postural&#xD;
      destabilization. The protocol training and the exercises were conducted by Club Muntanyenc&#xD;
      professional RG coaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A post-test was performed after the eight-week specific CST following the same procedure as&#xD;
      the pre-test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Statistical Analysis will be performed using an Excel spreadsheet and then exported to&#xD;
      the computer program SPSS statistics 22.0, to then perform the various statistical tests.&#xD;
      Initially, a normality test will be performed to check the distribution of the data and to&#xD;
      decide whether parametric or non-parametric tests are applied. The G-POWER program will be&#xD;
      used to calculate the statistical power of the sample with a value of p &lt;0.05 and an&#xD;
      estimated effect size of 0.5.&#xD;
