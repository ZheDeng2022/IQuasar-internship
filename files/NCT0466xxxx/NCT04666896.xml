  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For hEDS or HSD patients with MDI, a multidisciplinary treatment approach is suggested. As&#xD;
      follows, physiotherapy plays a key role in this integrative management. Nevertheless,&#xD;
      knowledge regarding EDS is limited among health care professionals. Consequently,&#xD;
      evidence-based treatment approaches for the hEDS/HSD population are scarce. Therefore, the&#xD;
      aim of this study is to compare two different home-based exercise programs in order to&#xD;
      increase our knowledge regarding treatment options, and to gain insight in safe, effective&#xD;
      exercises for the unstable shoulder in this study population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the value of two telerehabilitation exercise&#xD;
      programs for treating multidirectional shoulder instability (MDI) in patients diagnosed with&#xD;
      the hypermobile type of The Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) or Hypermobility Spectrum Disorders&#xD;
      (HSD). Patients were randomly assigned to either the control group (B: evidence-based&#xD;
      tailored care) or the experimental group (A: evidence-based standard care). Both groups&#xD;
      received a home-based exercise program of 24 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the&#xD;
      Western Ontario Shoulder Index (WOSI). Secondary outcomes included the Disabilities of the&#xD;
      Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH), Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK), Patient-Specific&#xD;
      Functional Scale (PSFS), Global Rating of Change (GROC), and pain pressure thresholds (PPTs).&#xD;
      Outcomes were assessed at baseline, after 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and at the end of the study (24&#xD;
      weeks).&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index (WOSI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks and 24 weeks, in order to assess the change in WOSI from baseline to 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The WOSI is a responsive patient-reported and disease-specific tool, designed to be used as the primary outcome measure in clinical trials that assess treatments for patients with shoulder instability. Range 0 - 2100 points. Higher scores express worse status.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Disabilities of the Arm Shoulder and Hand (DASH)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The DASH is a region-specific questionnaire of upper extremity disability (range 0-100). Higher scores express worse status</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The TSK is one of the most frequently used measures for evaluating general pain-related fear of movement. Range 17 - 68 points. Higher scores express worse status.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Patient-Specific Functional Scale (PSFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PSFS is a patient-rated outcome measure designed to evaluate functional change. Patients were asked to identify 3 activities they were having difficulty with as a result of their shoulder instability, and to rate each activity on an 11-point Likert scale (0 = impossible to perform the activity; 10 = able to perform the activity without complaints or help). At each follow-up moment, the same 3 activities were rated. The total PSFS score was calculated by adding the scores for the 3 activities. Range 0-30 points. Higher scores express better status.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Global Rating of Change (GROC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The GROC is a transitional scale used to quantify patient-perceived improvement. It can be used to assess the results of treatment since it defines the change in health status as perceived by the patient. We asked patients to rate whether or how much their shoulder has changed since the beginning of the study on a 11 point numerical scale ('How would you describe the change in your shoulder since the beginning of the treatment program?' with -5= a lot worse; 0 = unchanged; +5= fully recovered). Range -5 to 5 points. Higher scores express better status.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain pressure thresholds (PPT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>PPTs were measured on five locations around the shoulder (local PPTs). Additionally, a distal PPT was measured at the midpoint of the quadriceps muscle.</description>
