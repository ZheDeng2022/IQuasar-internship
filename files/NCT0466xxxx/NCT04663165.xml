  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this clinical study, we have collected GCF at diseased teeth and at the same time drawn&#xD;
      blood, both before and at 3, 6 and 12 months after periodontal surgical treatment. This give&#xD;
      us the opportunity to investigate if periodontal treatment could reduce inflammatory&#xD;
      biomarkers in the systemic circulation and if there is a co-variation between biomarkers in&#xD;
      GCF and blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In part I of this study, we focus on biomarkers from blood serum in patients with&#xD;
      periodontitis, before surgical therapy and under a healing period 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In part II, biomarkers in the locally collected GCF will be analyzed together with clinically&#xD;
      reported measurements and compared with biomarkers in blood serum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis are&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Periodontal treatment followed by clinical healing and periodontal health will be&#xD;
           associated a change/ reduction in biomarkers in GCF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The systemic levels of inflammatory biomarkers may show a delayed response to clinical&#xD;
           healing. Periodontal surgical therapy may reduce circulating inflammatory biomarkers&#xD;
           that could affect the low-grade chronic inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There is a co-variation between inflammatory biomarkers in GCF and the systemic&#xD;
           circulation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Periodontitis, a disease affecting the tissue supporting the tooth, is initiated by microbes&#xD;
      colonizing the tooth causing an inflammation of the soft tissue around the tooth. In some&#xD;
      sensitive individuals the inflammatory response leads to loss of jawbone, which affect the&#xD;
      bone support of the tooth and may end up in loss of teeth. Periodontitis is the sixth most&#xD;
      prevalent disease in the world, 40% of the population with affected jawbone support and&#xD;
      approximately 10% of the population suffer from severe loss of the supporting jawbone at&#xD;
      teeth. Periodontitis may be halted or resolved by removing the microbial biofilm from the&#xD;
      teeth root and in severe cases combined with surgical treatment removing inflammatory tissue.&#xD;
      The genetic factors explain approximately 50% of the disease, and but the etiology is in&#xD;
      parts unclear and effective therapy in sensitive individuals is still missing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inflammatory response initiated by microbes leads to degradation of the tooth supporting&#xD;
      tissues. The current view is that pro-inflammatory cytokines and prostaglandins, produced by&#xD;
      leukocytes and cells of mesenchymal origin in the inflamed tissue are responsible for&#xD;
      recruiting and activation of bone-resorbing cells, osteoclasts. The inflammatory biomarkers&#xD;
      and tissue degradation products will leak out into the exudate in the gingival pocket next to&#xD;
      the root surface. The bone resorption activity connected to changes in biomarkers levels and&#xD;
      clinical parameters, during healing after periodontal treatment seem to be of value to study.&#xD;
      The analysis of the local exudate (gingival crevicular fluid, GCF) could be used for&#xD;
      predicting and monitoring periodontitis, as well as finding new targets for treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periodontitis could also have a systemic effect, as locally released inflammatory mediators&#xD;
      might enter the systemic circulation and influence the development of inflammatory conditions&#xD;
      such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis. Earlier studies have&#xD;
      shown that a low-grade chronic inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenies in&#xD;
      atherosclerosis. Substances that indicate low-grade chronic inflammation in blood serum is&#xD;
      for example levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, and adhesion-molecules, and these&#xD;
      biomarkers are related to CVD. The question is if periodontal treatment could change/reduce&#xD;
      the systemic inflammatory burden of inflammatory biomarkers (CRP, fibrinogen, interleukins,&#xD;
      and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We know today that there is association between oral health and CVD, but we do not know if&#xD;
      the relationship it is of a causal nature. There are some intervention studies that indicate&#xD;
      that the oral inflammatory burden may have a systemic effect. To better understand the role&#xD;
      of the oral inflammation in development of atherosclerosis, it is important to study&#xD;
      biomarkers at different timepoints both from the local sites (GCF) and the general systemic&#xD;
      environment in blood. If there is a co-variation in levels of inflammatory biomarkers locally&#xD;
      in the GCF and in the systemic circulation, this could be a strong indication of a more&#xD;
      causal nature of the association, but we need more studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The value of the study is to better understand what drives the local disease progression in&#xD;
      periodontitis and also increase the knowledge by which mechanism the oral inflammation could&#xD;
      exert its systemic effect. Measuring levels of biomarkers in GCF and serum at several&#xD;
      timepoints after treatment we may contribute with new insights in the role of inflammatory&#xD;
      inducing molecules in periodontal disease, but also if there exists any systemic effect from&#xD;
      locally released inflammatory mediators. The possibility that some molecules co-variate with&#xD;
      disease progression or regression is of great value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The possible co-variation of molecules with disease progression or regression is important&#xD;
      knowledge in understanding how oral infection may affect the general health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part I: Serum biomarkers for periodontitis relapse Part II: GCF biomarkers for periodontal&#xD;
      healing and relapse&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective clinical intervention study to investigate healing of severe&#xD;
      periodontitis sites after periodontal surgical therapy and in what extent the clinical&#xD;
      healing is associated with changes of the inflammatory expression of biomarkers in gingival&#xD;
      crevicular fluid (GCF) and in blood serum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      21 patients were recruited consecutively and treated surgically of one experienced specialist&#xD;
      in periodontology. Two teeth in different quadrants per patient, with the deepest pocket&#xD;
      measured, were selected and included in the study. Periodontal surgery was performed and at&#xD;
      13 of the teeth an additional treatment with enamel matrix derivative (EMD/Emdogain®) were&#xD;
      performed. Registration of full mouth plaque score (FMPS), periodontal pocket depth (PPD),&#xD;
      bleeding on probing (BOP) or pus were performed before surgery, after 3, 6 and 12 months.&#xD;
      Radiographs were taken at examination before treatment and at the follow-up at 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples and samples of gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) were collected before and at the&#xD;
      follow-up visits 3, 6 and 12 months after surgical treatment. GCF samples was labelled and&#xD;
      stored at -80°C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples were drawn and handled by the chemical laboratory at Gävle hospital in&#xD;
      conjunction to therapy and follow-up points. Blood were collected from each patient and 5x1mL&#xD;
      serum was labelled and stored at -80°C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protein analysis on blood sera and GCF performed and concentrations of 92 proteins were&#xD;
      assessed by proximity extension assay (Olink Bioscience, Sweden) using the Inflammation&#xD;
      panel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vascular Injury Panel 2 Human Kit (Meso Scale Diagnostics) were used to assess concentration&#xD;
      of C-Reactive Protein (CRP), Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1 (ICAM-1), Serum Amyloid A&#xD;
      (SAA) and Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1 (VCAM-1) in sera.&#xD;
