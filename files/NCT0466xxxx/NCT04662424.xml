  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women's experience of pain during labor varies greatly, and pain control is a major concern&#xD;
      for obstetricians. Several methods have been studied for pain management for women in labor,&#xD;
      including drug and non-drug interventions Most methods of non-pharmacological pain management&#xD;
      are non-invasive and appear to be safe for mother and baby, including immersion in water,&#xD;
      relaxation, acupuncture, and massage. However, their efficacy is unclear, and based mostly on&#xD;
      non-randomized studies. On the other hand, there are strong data to support the efficacy of&#xD;
      pharmacological methods, including epidural analgesia, which improves pain relief but&#xD;
      increase the incidence of operative vaginal delivery Recently a clinical trial showed that&#xD;
      music in labor was associated with maternal benefits in women who underwent spontaneous&#xD;
      vaginal delivery. However, the effect of music in labor in women undergoing induction of&#xD;
      labor is still a subject of debate.&#xD;
