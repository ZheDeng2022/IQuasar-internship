    <textblock>
      All neurosurgical patients at the Neurosurgery University Hospital Bern who will be operated&#xD;
      for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) are routinely operated in deep anae¬sthesia with suppression&#xD;
      of the electrical activity of the electroencephalogram (EEG). To achieve this suppression of&#xD;
      the EEG activity (burst suppression, BS) high effector concentrations (Cet) of Propofol doses&#xD;
      are needed. However, a protracted infusion of large amounts of Propofol to reach a BS during&#xD;
      the operation can lead to accumulation and a protracted wake-up phase with poorer&#xD;
      neurological assessability. Somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP), and trans-cranial Doppler&#xD;
      flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery are measured to detect ischemia until the&#xD;
      operation. The SSEPs are used to verify the functional integrity of the nervous system in&#xD;
      combination of the EEG and both together exclude severe global ischemia during the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The central acting α2-agonist Dexmedetomidine could help to reduce the amount of Propofol&#xD;
      without influencing electrophysical studies. However, no data are currently known for&#xD;
      practical use in carotid endarterectomy with Propofol with co-administration of&#xD;
      Dexmedetomidine in conjunction with electrophysiological studies (SSEPs and MEPs).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In the investigators clinic, as a neuroprotective measure, all neurosurgical patients&#xD;
      operated for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) are routinely operated in deep anaesthesia with&#xD;
      suppression of the electrical activity of the electroence-phalogram (EEG). To achieve this&#xD;
      suppression of the EEG activity (burst suppression, BS) high effector concentrations (Cet) of&#xD;
      Propofol doses are needed. However, a protracted infusion of large amounts of Propofol to&#xD;
      reach a BS during the operation can lead to accumulation and a protracted wake-up phase with&#xD;
      poorer neurological assessability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP), and trans-cranial Doppler (TCD) flow velocity in the&#xD;
      middle cerebral artery are measured to detect ischemia. A significant decrease in TCD&#xD;
      velocity and/or SSEPs amplitudes during cross-clamping of the internal carotid artery (ICA)&#xD;
      gets treated with an adapted increase of arterial blood pressure or placement of a shunt.&#xD;
      Intraoperative monitoring and recording of data in every patient undergoing CEA median nerve&#xD;
      SEPs and MCA flow velocity have been constantly monitored by an additional intraoperative&#xD;
      monitoring (IOM) technician who has been trained and certified in the assessment of&#xD;
      intraoperative monitoring. The median nerve SEP amplitudes are recorded at least at these&#xD;
      events: baseline value before skin incision, EEG burst suppression before cross clamping of&#xD;
      the internal carotid artery, at time of ICA cross clamping, 10 minutes after cross clamping&#xD;
      or immediately after placement of shunt (ICA clamping), reperfusion of ICA and haemostasis /&#xD;
      end of surgery. The predefined criterion for temporary shunting was the reduction of more&#xD;
      than 50% of the SEP amplitude.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Median nerve somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) were performed by stimulation at the&#xD;
      wrist with a pair of needle electrodes (Inomed Germany®). This is a single pulse stimulation&#xD;
      with 0.5 ms pulse duration and a low repetition rate ranging from 0.7 - 2.3 Hz. Recording is&#xD;
      performed via corkscrew electrodes placed accordingly to the 10-20-EEG system on the patient&#xD;
      scalp. For the right median nerve SEP C3´/Fz and for the left median nerve SEP C4´/Fz is&#xD;
      chosen as standard derivation. Alternatively, Cz' or the contralateral Cp' served as&#xD;
      reference to improve quality of recording. To improve the signal to noise ratio the responses&#xD;
      are averaged 150-200 times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator use the somatosensive evoked potentials (SSEPs) to verify the functional&#xD;
      integrity of the nervous system. Standardized surgical and anaesthesiological measures at the&#xD;
      CEA with defined EEG endpoints and depending on the anaesthetic effect can - in normal EEG&#xD;
      and SSEPs - effectively exclude severe global ischemia. The effects of burst suppression and&#xD;
      the volatile anaesthetics on SSEPs were also investigated and showed no significant&#xD;
      difference. Since 2016, motor-induced evoked potentials (MEPs) have also been used, which&#xD;
      are, however, suppressed by volatile anaesthetics in a dose-dependent manner. On the other&#xD;
      hand, Dexmedetomidine in combination with Propofol seems to suppress only insignificantly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The indication spectrum for the centrally acting α2-agonist Dexmedetomidine has been&#xD;
      increasingly extended since its approval in Switzerland. In addition to the use of&#xD;
      Dexmedetomidine in the intensive care units, Dexmedetomidine is also increasingly being used&#xD;
      perioperatively up to premedication in children. In some studies, an anaesthetic reduction of&#xD;
      40-60% could be achieved or the opioid consumption after the addition of a α2-agonist could&#xD;
      be reduced by 50-75%. The blood pressure response to a Dexmedetomidine dose depends on the&#xD;
      rate of infusion). In addition, administration of Dexmedetomidine does not result in&#xD;
      respiratory depression or compromising of the respiratory tract. It has been shown that&#xD;
      Dexmedetomidine can cause a &quot;sleep-like&quot; sedation state and this state can be interrupted by&#xD;
      verbal stimuli), examined the EEG activity in sedations on voluntary subjects compared to a&#xD;
      control group with physiological sleep pattern. In this study, it was shown that the EEG&#xD;
      spindle activity in subjects with Dexmedetomidine infusion was comparable to that of a&#xD;
      physiological non-rapid eye-movement (nonREM) sleep stage II in the control tests. The&#xD;
      authors concluded from their investigations that a &quot;sleep-like state&quot; (stage II non-REM) can&#xD;
      be achieved by the Dexmed-etomidine infusion. However, no data are currently known for&#xD;
      practical use in carotid endarterectomy with Propofol and Dexmedetomidine in conjunction with&#xD;
      electrophysiological studies (somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP) and motor evoked&#xD;
      potentials (MEP)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, there is a high risk of postoperative delirium (POD) in many of these patients.&#xD;
      This was examined in a recently published Lancet study by Xian Su and colleagues in 700&#xD;
      patients with non-cardiac interventions in elderly patients). A reduction of the delirium&#xD;
      incidence from 23% to 9% was found after a low-dose Dexmedetomidine dose of 0.1 μg/kg body&#xD;
      weight/h. In addition, Dexmedetomidine is attributed a neuroprotective effect against&#xD;
      ischemic and hypoxic influences). Other animals-experimental studies indicate neuroprotection&#xD;
      in ischemic insult and subsequent reperfusion).&#xD;
