  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigation is to determine the optimal DRT/VIM target location and its&#xD;
      safety margins based on MR-SISET imaging features by comparing with postoperative lesions and&#xD;
      clinical outcomes in patients with tremor who will undergo the MRgFUS tremor therapy.&#xD;

      Magnetic susceptibility is an important source of contrast in MRI, which arises from the&#xD;
      subtle field perturbations generated by inter-molecular interaction in response to an&#xD;
      external magnetic field. The DRT tract consists mainly of axon fibers covered by myelin&#xD;
      sheaths that cause magnetic susceptibility variations. In addition, magnetic susceptibility&#xD;
      of fiber bundle is in fact anisotropic. Such distinctive features of the DRT can generate a&#xD;
      unique type of susceptibility contrast with respect to its neighboring thalamic tissues, yet&#xD;
      clinically practical protocols are lacking. This study will utilize a novel MR&#xD;
      susceptibility-based method, termed 'MR Susceptibility Imaging with Short Echo Time&#xD;
      (MR-SISET)' which leverages short echo times to realize high contrast for direct and&#xD;
      individualized DRT targeting. Combined with machine learning (ML) approaches, an automatic,&#xD;
      operator-independent DRT-recognition will be achieved. This could provide a valid support to&#xD;
      operators in the surgical planning and significantly improve the current operative&#xD;
      methodology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MR imaging will be done on a 3T MRI Magnet at the NYU Langone Health. All patients will&#xD;
      undergo a routine clinical preoperative MRI of the brain under general anesthesia to reduce&#xD;
      movement artifacts. The proposed sequence (&lt;15 minutes) will be added as a supplementary&#xD;
      sequence only for the preoperative imaging for subjects who agree to participate. The&#xD;
      operator/clinician will be blinded to the results of this study for the MRgFUS treatment. A&#xD;
      routine clinical postoperative MRI will be performed prior to discharge by the clinician,&#xD;
      typically the following day of the MRgFUS treatment. The severity of tremor will be assessed&#xD;
      before and after the treatment (~6 weeks). Postoperative clinical data will be retrieved to&#xD;
      get a surgical target lesion and clinical outcome after treatment in order to confirm our&#xD;
      method.&#xD;
