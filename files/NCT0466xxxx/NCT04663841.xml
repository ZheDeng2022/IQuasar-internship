  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this observational study is to test whether neuroimaging biomarkers of&#xD;
      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can be prospectively replicated in a large&#xD;
      ecologically valid sample. We focus on cognitive network connectivity as a predictive&#xD;
      biomarker of the clinical effect of TMS, and as a response biomarker of change with TMS. We&#xD;
      address this objective through a pragmatic approach in which we recruit patients undergoing&#xD;
      routine clinical care and program evaluation in a Veterans Administration multi-site clinical&#xD;
      TMS program.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is becoming a gold standard&#xD;
      treatment for pharmacoresistant depression, we lack neural target biomarkers for identifying&#xD;
      who is most likely to respond to TMS and why. To address this gap in knowledge this&#xD;
      observational study evaluates neural targets defined by activation and functional&#xD;
      connectivity of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex-anchored cognitive control circuit,&#xD;
      regions of the default mode network and attention circuit, and interactions with the&#xD;
      subgenual anterior cingulate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study evaluates whether these targets and interactions between them change in a&#xD;
      dose-dependent manner, whether changes in these neural targets correspond to changes in&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral performance, and whether baseline and early change in neural target and&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral performance predict subsequent symptom severity, suicidality, and&#xD;
      quality of life outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed as a pragmatic, mechanistic observational trial partnering with the&#xD;
      National Clinical TMS Program of the Veteran's Health Administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All veterans will receive a clinical course of TMS as part of their routine care. Those who&#xD;
      agree to enrollment in the observational study will be assessed at 'baseline' prior to&#xD;
      commencement of their TMS treatment, 'first week' after initiation of TMS (targeting five&#xD;
      sessions) and 'post-treatment' at the completion of TMS (targeting 30 sessions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Veterans will be assessed using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a cognitive&#xD;
      behavioral performance battery, and established questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge, our study will be the first pragmatic, mechanistic observational trial to&#xD;
      use fMRI imaging and cognitive-behavioral performance as biomarkers of TMS treatment response&#xD;
      in pharmacoresistant MDD.&#xD;
