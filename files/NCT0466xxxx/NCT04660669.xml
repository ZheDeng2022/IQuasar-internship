  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Early Start Denver Model (ESDM) has shown its efficiency in the early management of ASD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to evaluate the efficiency of a new type of management based on a&#xD;
      semi-intensive center-based intervention (8h per week) coupled with a MOOC (Massive Online&#xD;
      Open Course: a teaching and learning intervention based on instrumental and interactive&#xD;
      teaching situations) for remote parental training/supervision. The goal is to determine if&#xD;
      compared to the ESDM reference intervention (15h per week), this type of care can bring, a&#xD;
      sufficient improvement in child development course and decreased symptoms of autism in young&#xD;
      children, and if it could be, therefore, better suited to the needs of children and their&#xD;
      family, bypassing the previously stated obstacles.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Group 1 receives 15 hours per week of ESDM intervention from ESDM therapists. The parents benefit from a 20 hour parent training program delivered in the participating center. Group 2 receives 8 hours per week of ESDM intervention from ESDM therapists in addition to whatever community service the parents choose. The parents benefit from a training program remotely delivered via a MOOC platform as well as parental supervision of sessions delivered at home 1 hour per week for the duration of the study.</intervention_model_description>
