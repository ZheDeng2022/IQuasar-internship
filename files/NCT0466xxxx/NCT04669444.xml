  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients in end-stage cardiac failure and/or respiratory failure may be started on a rescue&#xD;
      therapy known as Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO). One of the major clinical&#xD;
      questions is how to manage the ventilator when patients are on ECMO therapy. Ventilator&#xD;
      Induced Lung Injury (VILI) can result from aggressive ventilation of the lung during critical&#xD;
      illness. VILI and lung injury such as Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) can further&#xD;
      increase the total body inflammation and stress, this is known as biotrauma. Biotrauma is one&#xD;
      of the mechanisms that causes multi-organ failure in critically ill patients. One advantage&#xD;
      of ECMO is the ability to greatly reduce the use of the ventilator and thus VILI by taking&#xD;
      control of the patient's oxygenation and acid-base status. By minimizing VILI during ECMO we&#xD;
      can reduce biotrauma and thus multi-organ failure. Since the optimal ventilator settings for&#xD;
      ECMO patients are not known, we plan to study the impact of different ventilator settings&#xD;
      during ECMO on patient's physiology and biomarkers of inflammation and injury.&#xD;
