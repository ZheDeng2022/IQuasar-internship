  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the major causes of prosthetic joint failure is infection. Recently,&#xD;
      coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CoNS) have been identified as emergent, nosocomial&#xD;
      pathogens involved in subclinical prosthetic joint infections (PJIs). The diagnosis of PJIs&#xD;
      mediated by CoNS is complex and demanding due to the absence of clear clinical signs derived&#xD;
      from the host immune system response. In this scenario, the key to successful surgical&#xD;
      treatment is the capability to differentiate between aseptic implant loosening and septic&#xD;
      failure. Hence, the central hypothesis of this study is that proteomic analysis of the&#xD;
      secretome of CoNS clinical isolates associated with the characterization of patient synovial&#xD;
      fluids will reveal a panel of putative biomarkers tightly linked to PJIs. The confirmation of&#xD;
      the presence of bacterial PJI biomarkers in synovial fluids of infected patients will pave&#xD;
      the way for the development of a new reliable test capable of aiding in the diagnosis of&#xD;
      subclinical PJIs.&#xD;

      Task 1.1: Synovial fluids will be collected from 60 patients referred to IRCCS Galeazzi&#xD;
      Orthopedic Institute for the revision of a septic prosthesis and from 40 patients undergoing&#xD;
      revision due to aseptic failure. The collected synovial fluids will be stored at -80°C until&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to MSIS guidelines, the measurement of CRP and ESR levels, synovial WBC count, and&#xD;
      the microbiological culture of the explanted device and periprosthetic tissue will be&#xD;
      conducted following routine protocols. Only synovial fluid collected from patients of the&#xD;
      infected group diagnosed with a PJI mediated by CoNS will be eligible for subsequent&#xD;
      proteomic analyses. Task 1.2: The secretome of at least 10 isolates of the retrieved species&#xD;
      of CoNS will be characterized. In particular, CoNS clinical isolates will be cultured in a&#xD;
      drip flow reactor to induce the production of biofilm and the secretome analyzed to perform&#xD;
      the first selection of proteins of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Task 2.1: Proteins extracted from the synovial fluids of patients with or without PJI will be&#xD;
      carbamidomethylated and digested by trypsin. Thereafter, peptide mixtures will be analyzed by&#xD;
      nano liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (nano LC-MS/MS). Label-free&#xD;
      quantifications (LFQ) will be applied to assess the levels of proteins expressed by bacteria&#xD;
      and secreted in patient synovial fluids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Task 2.2: Using proteomic software (i.e. MaxQuant, Perseus, etc.), the bioinformatic analysis&#xD;
      will be performed to determine a pool of proteins of interest present only in samples&#xD;
      belonging to the infected group of patients which would be closely related to the presence of&#xD;
      bacteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Task 3.1: Proteins of interest identified in Task 1.2 and Task 2.2 as putative biomarkers&#xD;
      related to CoNS-mediated PJIs will be selected for targeted proteomic analyses by means of&#xD;
      additional bioinformatic analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Task 3.2: To confirm the presence of putative biomarkers defined in Task 3.1 in synovial&#xD;
      fluid of enrolled patients, targeted proteomic analysis will be performed on all the&#xD;
      infected/not infected samples collected in Task 1.1. Prototypic peptides for each putative&#xD;
      biomarker will be selected by Skyline software. Ionization and fragmentation behaviors of all&#xD;
      candidate peptides will be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Task 3.3: Finally, the information from the targeted proteomic analysis will be correlated to&#xD;
      the outcomes of the diagnosis formulated following the MSIS guidelines in order to evaluate&#xD;
      the diagnostic value of each selected biomarker.&#xD;
