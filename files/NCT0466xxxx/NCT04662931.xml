  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic blood disorder. Crizanlizumab has been approved in&#xD;
      India and other countries to reduce the frequency of vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs) in patients&#xD;
      with SCD aged 16 years and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this local Phase IV study is to evaluate the safety of crizanlizumab&#xD;
      specifically in Indian patients with SCD aged 16 years or older with a history of VOC leading&#xD;
      to healthcare visit.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic blood disorder, caused by a mutation in the β-globin&#xD;
      gene, which early on progresses into a systemic disease. Vaso-occlusion is a hallmark of SCD&#xD;
      and can lead to serious acute and chronic complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Crizanlizumab has been approved in US, India and other countries to reduce the frequency of&#xD;
      vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs) in patients with SCD aged 16 years and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this local Phase IV study is to evaluate the safety of crizanlizumab&#xD;
      specifically in Indian patients with SCD aged 16 years or older with a history of VOC leading&#xD;
      to healthcare visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is open label and single armed. 140 patients will be treated with crizanlizumab for&#xD;
      about one year at a dose of 5 mg/kg in addition to receiving standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to assess frequency, severity and causality of serious adverse&#xD;
      events (SAEs) during the treatment period. Secondary objective is to assess overall safety&#xD;
      and tolerability of crizanlizumab.&#xD;
