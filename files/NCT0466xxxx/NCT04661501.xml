  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized single blinded prospective clinical trial comparing the surgical&#xD;
      outcomes of four different acellular dermal matrixes (ADMs) after primary breast&#xD;
      reconstruction. ADMs are used in conjunction with tissue expanders or breast implants to&#xD;
      reinforce the recreated breast pocket. Currently, 4 different ADMS are commercially&#xD;
      available: AlloDerm, DermaCell, Allomax and Flex HD. It is unclear which ADM is clinically&#xD;
      superior. The objective of the study is to compare the complications and post-op care of 4&#xD;
      different ADMs within a 2 year follow up to elucidate their surgical outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized control trial and will include all patients who are agreeable and&#xD;
      deemed appropriate for alloplastic breast reconstruction involving the use of an ADM with two&#xD;
      stage tissue expander (TE) reconstruction. The ADMs used will be determined by random&#xD;
      assignment to one of four available products being utilized within the study: AlloDerm,&#xD;
      AlloMax, DermACELL and FlexHD. Each ADM product will comprise of an individual treatment arm.&#xD;
      Participants undergoing bilateral reconstruction will have the same ADM used in each side.&#xD;
      The four treatment arms will be compared to assess their impact on our primary outcome:&#xD;
      proportion of clinically significant post-operative seroma requiring intervention. Analysis&#xD;
      will be performed per surgeon to prevent post-operative outcomes from being confounded by the&#xD;
      principle operator. The trial will initially be conducted as an internal pilot study. The&#xD;
      study will initially target a study population of 40 patients for recruitment as a means to&#xD;
      assess the feasibility of the study. In doing this, the pilot study will be able to establish&#xD;
      the necessary protocol and administrative infrastructure that is needed to complete the trial&#xD;
      in its entirety. This create a sample population for initial outcomes.&#xD;
