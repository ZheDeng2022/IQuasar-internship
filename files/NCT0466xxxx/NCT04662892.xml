  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, prospective, observational cohort registry in subjects receiving&#xD;
      myelosuppressive chemotherapy for a non-myeloid malignancy who are considered to be at high&#xD;
      risk for developing febrile neutropenia (FN).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Little is known about the real-world risk of febrile neutropenia (FN) among subjects&#xD;
      receiving Udenyca. Udenyca was approved due to the totality of evidence under the new Food&#xD;
      and Drug Administration (FDA) pathway 351 (k), which met all the endpoints of pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD) and immunogenicity in healthy volunteers. Udenyca is the only&#xD;
      pegfilgrastim that has not been studied in actual patient cohorts; it has only been studied&#xD;
      in healthy volunteers. This prospective observational cohort study is designed to estimate&#xD;
      the risk of FN among subjects who 1) are at high risk for FN while receiving myelosuppressive&#xD;
      chemotherapy in a real-world outcomes setting and 2) receive Udenyca for FN prophylaxis with&#xD;
      each cycle of highly myelotoxic chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Plans: After signing the informed consent form, data collection will start at visit&#xD;
      1/cycle 1 (screening/enrollment [day 1]); subjects who received chemotherapy up to 1 week&#xD;
      prior to enrollment are eligible to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1/cycle 1 is to coincide with day 1 (± 7 days) of the subjects' chemotherapy treatment;&#xD;
      data collection should start at day 1/visit 1/cycle 1 of chemotherapy. Entries will be&#xD;
      recorded during a subject's medical chart review to obtain information on demographic&#xD;
      factors, malignancy characteristics (e.g., malignancy histology, date of initial malignancy&#xD;
      diagnosis, stage at diagnosis, current malignancy stage, any previous cancer therapy&#xD;
      [radiation, surgery, or chemotherapy]), relevant comorbidities, laboratory data, and relevant&#xD;
      concomitant therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects' socio-demographic and clinical characteristics will be collected on the date of&#xD;
      enrollment and include age, sex, geographic region, health plan information, socioeconomic&#xD;
      status (employment status), body surface area, and tobacco use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed clinical information and laboratory information will be collected, including&#xD;
      subjects' medical and treatment history, comorbid conditions, and history of any other&#xD;
      malignancies (as well as any treatment received for these other malignancies). Additionally,&#xD;
      subject Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status, relevant concomitant&#xD;
      medications, and any adverse events that occur throughout the study will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be followed from study enrollment (Cycle 1, Visit 1) throughout the end of&#xD;
      their treatment cycle or until the earliest of loss to follow-up, withdrawal of consent,&#xD;
      death, end of study (EOS), discontinuation of chemotherapy regimen prior to 4 cycles, or&#xD;
      termination of study by the sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study data will be captured using the electronic case report form (eCRF), which will&#xD;
      contain information collected directly about the subjects and their treatment/outcomes from&#xD;
      the healthcare study research personnel. Data will be entered into the eCRF by research&#xD;
      coordinators at the individual sites. The data to be entered into the eCRF will be obtained&#xD;
      from paper or electronic medical records depending on the technology used by individual&#xD;
      sites. The short form health survey SF-12 Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL) instrument&#xD;
      will be used for HRQoL outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A data management plan will be created and will describe all functions, processes, and&#xD;
      specifications for data collection, cleaning, and validation. The eCRFs will include&#xD;
      programmable edits to obtain immediate feedback if data are missing, out of range, illogical,&#xD;
      or potentially erroneous. Concurrent manual data review will be performed based on parameters&#xD;
      dictated by the plan. Ad hoc queries will be generated within the electronic data capture&#xD;
      (EDC) system and followed up until resolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High data quality standards will be maintained, and processes and procedures will be utilized&#xD;
      to repeatedly ensure that the data are as clean and accurate as possible when presented&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data quality will be enhanced through a series of programmed data quality checks that&#xD;
      automatically detect out-of-range or anomalous data.&#xD;
