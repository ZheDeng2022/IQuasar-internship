  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the level of students' self-esteem (explicit and&#xD;
      implicit) before and after an online intervention. All selected participants will enjoy one&#xD;
      of the online working groups led by a psychologist for five weeks. In these group sessions,&#xD;
      students will be trained to identify how their low self-esteem was developed, what are those&#xD;
      factors that maintain their low self-esteem and what can they do for improving their low&#xD;
      self-esteem, using Fennell model.&#xD;

    <measure>Changes in Rosenberg's Self Esteem Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Pre- to Post-Intervention (5 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Rosenberg's Self Esteem Scale is a self-esteem measure widely used in social-science research. It is a ten-item likert-type scale with items answered on a four-point scale-from strongly disagree to strongly agree.

A higher score means a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>System usability</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-Intervention (5 weeks)</time_frame>
