  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of SLS-002&#xD;
      (intranasal racemic ketamine) in addition to standard of care on symptoms of Major Depressive&#xD;
      Disorder (MDD) and suicidality, in participants who are assessed to be at imminent risk for&#xD;
      suicide, as measured by the change from baseline on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating&#xD;
      Scale (MADRS) total score at 24 hours post first dose.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-part study: Part 1 is open-label, while Part 2 is a randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, multicenter study. The study will enroll participants with MDD for whom a&#xD;
      physician has assessed to be at risk for suicide. The study will consist of a screening&#xD;
      evaluation, a treatment period, and a safety follow-up period. Participants' safety will be&#xD;
      evaluated throughout the study. If you or a loved one are having thoughts of suicide, please&#xD;
      seek immediate medical help. Go to the emergency room or call the National Suicide Prevention&#xD;
      Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1, predose) and 24 hours post first dose (Day 2)</time_frame>
    <description>MADRS is clinician-rated scale designed to be used in participants with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) to measure depression severity and detect changes due to antidepressant treatment. It evaluates apparent sadness, reported sadness, inner tension, sleep, appetite, concentration, lassitude, interest level, pessimistic and suicidal thoughts. Scale consists of 10 items, each of which is scored from 0 (item not present or normal) to 6 (severe or continuous presence of symptoms), summed for total possible score of 0 to 60.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Clinical Global Impression of Severity for Suicidal Ideation and Behavior (CGIS-SI/B) Scale at 24 Hours Post First Dose</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1, predose) and 24 hours post first dose (Day 2)</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical global impression of severity for suicidal ideation and behavior (CGIS-SI/B) scale is revised version of the clinical global impression severity scale (CGI-S), a global rating scale that gives an overall measure of the severity of a participant's illness. The CGIS-SI/B summarizes the clinician's overall impression of severity of suicidal ideation and behavior on a 5-point scale from 1 (not at all suicidal) to 5 (among the most extremely suicidal), based on the totality of information available to the clinician.</description>

    <description>The Sheehan-Suicidality Tracking Scale Clinically Meaningful Change Measure (S-STS CMCM) is a clinician-rated outcome measure which assesses suicidal ideation and behavior on a standard 22-item scale, as well as multiple patient and clinician-rated items. The first 16 items are rated on a Likert-type scale ranging from 0 = not at all to 4 = extremely, where select scoring (i.e., 4 specific items are scored based on the highest score on 2 of those items) yields a total score ranging from 0 to 52.</description>
