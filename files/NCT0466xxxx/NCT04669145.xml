  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To identify the benefits from regional anesthesia use as pain management in the pediatric&#xD;
      population by delineating the differences in efficacy of continuous nerve blockade versus&#xD;
      single-shot techniques after pediatric orthopaedic limb procedures. By doing this, the&#xD;
      investigators can determine if specific anesthetic techniques should become a standard of&#xD;
      care in pain management for the pediatric population and supersede the need for opioid&#xD;
      medication.&#xD;
