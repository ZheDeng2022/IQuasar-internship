  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patellofemoral pain syndrome is a condition of misleading diagnosis. It mostly affects&#xD;
      individuals with ages between 18-40 years. It is believed that much work has been done on the&#xD;
      joint itself in treating the Quadriceps muscles and triggers related to it but now literature&#xD;
      is focusing on the segmental involvement, where weakness of the hip abductors and lateral&#xD;
      rotators play a major role. Therefore, interventions used for treating this syndrome should&#xD;
      include on focusing the hip muscles for trigger point therapy as well as strengthening them&#xD;
      in increasing the stability of the hip and pelvis to reduce excessive valgus forces on the&#xD;
      knee.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Literature regarding Gluteus Medius trigger point is quite scarce especially in alleviating&#xD;
      the pain related to Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome. The management of Patellofemoral Pain&#xD;
      Syndrome includes a segmental treatment, giving special focus to the lateral rotators and&#xD;
      abductors of the hip especially Gluteus Medius muscle, rather than treating the&#xD;
      Patellofemoral Joint itself. It will help in improving the pain of the subjects suffering&#xD;
      from this syndrome effectively, and within a shorter duration of time. It will also provide&#xD;
      the practicing physiotherapist with an insight for treating such patients with better&#xD;
      outcomes. Myofascial Trigger Points of the Gluteus Medius are important contributing factors&#xD;
      in the management of Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome which is identified in a single study as&#xD;
      per author's knowledge. But the treatment used to release the trigger point of Gluteus Medius&#xD;
      in managing this syndrome has not yet been explored. So, this study will compare two&#xD;
      well-known treatments in comprehending which one of the two techniques have better effects on&#xD;
      the population to be studied. Written consent will be taken from all the study participants.&#xD;
      Simple randomization technique will be used through &quot;Randomization Main&quot; software and&#xD;
      randomization sheet will be generated. 60 participants with patellofemoral pain syndrome&#xD;
      having Gluteus Medius trigger point will be randomly allocated in two equal group.&#xD;
