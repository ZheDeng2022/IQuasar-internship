  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease with around 200.000 patients in&#xD;
      Germany. Besides physical symptoms, cognitive resources degrade over the years. Transcranial&#xD;
      direct current stimulation (tDCS) is an established procedure to modulate cortical&#xD;
      excitability in motor and cognitive functions. Therefore, tDCS may improve cognitive&#xD;
      functions in patients with MS. Patients will work on a modified version of the symbol digits&#xD;
      modalities test in two experimental sessions. During the task, they will receive either&#xD;
      active stimulation or sham stimulation in a crossover design. Active stimulation is divided&#xD;
      in anodal and cathodal stimulation. Anodal stimulation should facilitate cognitive&#xD;
      processing; cathodal stimulation, on the other hand, should hinder cognitive processing.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease characterized by a&#xD;
      multitude of symptoms, which greatly reduce the quality of life of patients. In addition to&#xD;
      sensory and visual sensory disorders, movement disorders, paresis, fatigue and other physical&#xD;
      symptoms, 65-95% of patients with MS also suffer from cognitive impairments. These cognitive&#xD;
      impairments develop in the later course of the disease and express themselves in slower&#xD;
      processing speed, delays in learning and memory performance, and executive dysfunction. In&#xD;
      recent years, non-pharmacological approaches aimed at improving cognitive performance in MS&#xD;
      have increasingly come into focus, including the transcranial direct current stimulation&#xD;
      (tDCS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      TDCS has only been investigated in a few studies that had the aim to improve cognitive&#xD;
      performance in MS. Further, it has only been carried out in combination with cognitive&#xD;
      training paradigms and repeated stimulation sessions. Mattioli and colleagues (2016) could&#xD;
      e.g. show that after 10 sessions of cognitive training with tDCS stimulation of the&#xD;
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, there was greater improvement in symbol-digit modalities test&#xD;
      (SDMT) in the experimental group than in the control group. Similarly, Charvet and colleagues&#xD;
      (2018) showed that after 10 sessions of cognitive training with simultaneous tDCS stimulation&#xD;
      of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the experimental group showed a significant&#xD;
      improvement in the domains of attention and response variability compared to the control&#xD;
      group. These studies therefore reflect an interaction between cognitive training and tDCS,&#xD;
      and do not allow any conclusions to be drawn about the effect of tDCS on specific processes.&#xD;
      It is not yet known whether tDCS alone can positively influence specific cognitive functional&#xD;
      impairments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the present study wants to investigate whether acute application of tDCS can&#xD;
      improve specific cognitive functions. An adapted version of the clinically SDMT was&#xD;
      conducted, as this test is one of the most widely used tests to describe cognitive&#xD;
      impairments in MS. Based on a meta-analysis by Silva and colleagues (2018), that shows which&#xD;
      brain areas are related to the implementation of the SDMT, the parietal cortex (BA7) is&#xD;
      stimulated bilaterally with either excitatory (anodal) or inhibitory (cathodal) tDCS.&#xD;
