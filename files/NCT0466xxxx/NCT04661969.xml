  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Illicit subcutaneous injection of high-viscosity fluids for restoration and improvement of&#xD;
      body contour is a growing trend all around the world. Many local and systemic complications&#xD;
      have been described. Local complications include deformity at the site of injection,&#xD;
      granulomas and several skin changes like erythema, induration, and plaques&#xD;
      (well-circumscribed, elevated, superficial, solid lesion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator designed a single-center, cross-sectional, retrospective, consecutive case&#xD;
      series study and evaluated 49 surgeries performed in 35 patients with the history of foreign&#xD;
      substances injection for cosmetic purposes and developed local complications. Investigators&#xD;
      divided 4 groups accordingly to localization of foreign substances (FS). Group 1) FS&#xD;
      disseminated to both lower extremities and buttocks; group 2) FS isolated to buttocks with&#xD;
      moderate to severe skin changes, Group 3) FS isolated to lower legs with mild skin changes&#xD;
      and superficial ulcerations and 4) FS isolated to lower legs with moderate to severe skin&#xD;
      changes and/or ulceration. The investigators treated all patients surgically, which consisted&#xD;
      of isolate ultrasonic liposuction for extraction of the material from the affected region&#xD;
      (group 1) In-bloc excision and primary closure (group 2), Resection plus Vacuum assisted&#xD;
      closure (VAC) and split thickness skin graft (STSG) (group 3) and In-bloc excision and&#xD;
      microsurgical reconstruction (group 4). Statistical analysis was performed to find relations&#xD;
      between type of surgery with complications, reactivation of symptoms, time for reactivation&#xD;
      and a disease-free survival test (kaplan meier) was done.&#xD;
