  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-resistance therapy is a combination of muscle compression relaxation technique and joint&#xD;
      mobilization in patients with acute neck pain caused by traffic accidents. This study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness and safety of non-resistance therapy for pain and function&#xD;
      problems in patients complaining of acute neck pain induced by traffic accidents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So, investigators conduct a randomized controlled trials to verify the effectiveness and&#xD;
      safety of non-resistance therapy. From December 2020 to May 2021, investigators recruit 120&#xD;
      inpatients who are suffered from acute neck pain with the numeric rating scale(NRS) over 5 by&#xD;
      traffic accident(TA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Korean medical treatment group(n=60) receives daily acupuncture, herbal medicine, and&#xD;
      chuna treatment as inpatient treatment from hospitalization until discharge. For the&#xD;
      non-resistance therapy group(n=60), the korean medical treatment is performed in the same&#xD;
      manner, but additional non-resistance therapy is performed once a day from the 2nd day to the&#xD;
      5th day of hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline is the time point before treatment for non-resistance therapy on the second day of&#xD;
      hospitalization, and the primary endpoint is the time point after treatment on the 5th day&#xD;
      (v5) after hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For these two groups, investigators compare NRS(Numeric Rating Scale), Visual Analogue&#xD;
      Scale(VAS), Range Of Motion(ROM), Neck Disability Index(NDI), the 12-Item Short Form Health&#xD;
      Survey(SF-12), and PTSD Checklist for DSM(Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental&#xD;
      Disorders, DSM)-5(PCL-5).&#xD;
