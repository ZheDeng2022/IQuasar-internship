    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the single-dose pharmacokinetics (PK) and pivotal&#xD;
      bioequivalence of 3 compounds Darunavir (DRV), emtricitabine (FTC), and tenofovir alafenamide&#xD;
      (TAF) in the presence of cobicistat (COBI) when administered as an fixed dose combination&#xD;
      (FDC) (Darunavir/Cobicistat/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir Alafenamide [D/C/F/TAF]) compared to the&#xD;
      co-administration as the separate commercial formulations (DRV and F/TAF and COBI), under fed&#xD;
      conditions, in healthy adult participants.&#xD;
