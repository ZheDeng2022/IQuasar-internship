  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemineglect is a sequel to stroke, which appears more frequently when the injury occurs in&#xD;
      the right cerebral hemisphere. Hemineglect refers to those patients who do not pay attention&#xD;
      to their left side, presenting movement disorders that do not allow them to participate&#xD;
      spontaneously in their activities of daily life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are different methodologies for the treatment of hemineglect. Among them, we find&#xD;
      optokinetic stimulation (OKS), which consists of creating an illusory movement to the left to&#xD;
      center the patient's frame of reference and thus, make them pay more attention to their left&#xD;
      side. In recent years, the effect that this therapy has on motor movement disorders has begun&#xD;
      to be explored, although the parameters for its correct application still seem to be unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this reason, our aim is to describe the effect that the OKS has on balance, posture,&#xD;
      spatial representation and conscience, and movement disorders in hemineglect. Patients with&#xD;
      hemineglect will undergo OKS in different experimental conditions, where the speed of the&#xD;
      stimulus and the attention to it will be varied, to see its influence on the recovery of this&#xD;
      sequel of stroke.&#xD;

    <measure>Fluff Test</measure>
    <time_frame>60 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>It is a tool specifically designed to assess body representation in patients with hemineglect, through a body examination with closed eyes, and the removal of stickers located on both sides of the body. The percentage of stickers removed from each part of the body is assessed. It will be measured before and after the application of each experimental situation</description>

    <measure>Bisection of the line</measure>
    <time_frame>60 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>It is one of the most used tools in the assessment of hemineglect. It consists of marking the middle of a line and evaluating how much deviation to the right occurs. The distance in centimeters to the center of the line is calculated. It will be measured before and after the application of each experimental situation</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Motor extinction</measure>
    <time_frame>60 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>It is a phenomenon that occurs when the patient is stimulated in both extremities and is asked to move the one he has felt. The patient verbally expresses having felt the stimulation on both sides but only moves his right limb. To assess its presence, it is recorded whether participant is able to move both limbs when receiving bilateral stimulation or not. It will be measured before and after the application of each experimental situation</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Motor Impersistence</measure>
    <time_frame>60 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>It determines the affectation of attention on motor activities. To assess it, participant is asked to maintain a motor activity (eyes closed, mouth open, arm raised) and it is observed if it is capable of doing it for at least 10 seconds. It will be measured before and after the application of each experimental situation</description>

    <description>Participants are placed in a standing position, with support products, if necessary, and virtual reality glasses will be placed where the visual stimuli will be projected.&#xD;
The study will be carried out in four different experimental conditions. These conditions will be determined by the speed of stimulation and by the voluntary or unwilling attention of the subject during the intervention. Each participant will be exposed to Slow Optokinetic Stimulation without Attention (SOKS -), Fast Optokinetic Stimulation without Attention (FOKS -), Slow Optokinetic Stimulation with Attention (SOKS +) and Fast Optokinetic Stimulation with Attention (FOKS +). The interventions will be carried out on different days with a separation between them of at least one week.&#xD;
Fast stimulations will be performed at 60º / second and slow ones at 10º / second. In the conditions with attention, the participants will be asked to detect changes that will occur in the stimulus.</description>
