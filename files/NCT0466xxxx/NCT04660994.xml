  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A growing number of children with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) or nocturnal&#xD;
      alveolar hypoventilation syndrome are treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)&#xD;
      or nocturnal non-invasive ventilation (NIV) therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The compliance of the child and his caregivers with CPAP / NIV therapy may be challenging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of an educational game (Yapouni) aims at improving communication around CPAP / NIV&#xD;
      between the child and his caregivers, and may facilitate the compliance with CPAP / NIV at&#xD;
      home, by increasing the motivation for using CPAP / NIV at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to assess the parents' feelings regarding the use of CPAP / NIV on&#xD;
      day 0 (D0) and one month (D30) later in a standard group: therapeutic education (TEP) versus&#xD;
      a group: TEP + Yapouni.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study concerns children with severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and / or alveolar&#xD;
      hypoventilation requiring the initiation of CPAP/NIV. Most of these children have associated&#xD;
      diseases (craniofacial malformations, trisomy 21, Prader Willi syndrome or neuromuscular&#xD;
      diseases) which are accompanied by an abnormality of nocturnal breathing causing&#xD;
      abnormalities in gas exchange and abnormalities of architecture and quality of sleep, with&#xD;
      deleterious consequences on neurocognitive, cardiovascular and metabolic functions. In the&#xD;
      absence of other treatments, the initiation of CPAP or NIV during sleep can correct the&#xD;
      respiratory anomalies and the deleterious consequences. Optimal compliance with treatment is&#xD;
      therefore essential for its efficacy and therapeutic education (TEP) plays a key role.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The compliance of the child and his caregivers with CPAP / NIV therapy may be challenging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of an educational game (Yapouni) aims at improving communication around CPAP / NIV&#xD;
      between the child and his caregivers, and may facilitate the compliance with CPAP / NIV at&#xD;
      home, by increasing the motivation for using CPAP / NIV at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Yapouni educational game is based on a hot air balloon that will fly according to the&#xD;
      number of hours the child has slept with his/her CPAP / NIV. Thus, the longer the child&#xD;
      sleeps with his/her CPAP / NIV, the farther and higher his/her hot air balloon will fly in&#xD;
      the sky. The game includes wild cards and rewards that are worked out with the child and&#xD;
      his/her parents for an optimal individualized adaptation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to assess the parents' feelings regarding the use of CPAP / NIV on D0&#xD;
      and D30 later in a standard group: therapeutic education (TEP) versus a group: TEP + Yapouni.&#xD;
