  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators compared the surgical outcomes according to the type of&#xD;
      antibiotics before surgery in patients who did not have evidence of systemic infection during&#xD;
      acute cholecystitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of the study was to determine the type of preoperative antibiotics in&#xD;
      patients who were scheduled for cholecystectomy, because of the mild (grade I) or moderate&#xD;
      (grade 2) acute inflammatory gallbladder disease without gallbladder perforation. The&#xD;
      investigators compared the incidence of postoperative complications according to the types of&#xD;
      preoperative antibiotics(the first-generation vs second-generation cephalosporin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary purpose of the study was to confirm the clinical efficacy of first-generation&#xD;
      cephalosporins following the use of empirical antibiotics. And the investigators compare with&#xD;
      postoperative pain, postoperative hospital stay, re-hospitalization, and need for additional&#xD;
      treatment. In addition, the investigators compare the postoperative complications, such as&#xD;
      atelectasis and postoperative ileus.&#xD;

&#xD;
           D. Subject selection criteria, exclusion criteria, number of target subjects and their&#xD;
           rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. among patients with mild acute cholecystitis (grade I by Tokyo guidelines) or&#xD;
                     moderate acute cholecystitis without evidence of gallbladder perforation(grade&#xD;
                     II)&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. cholecystitis with a thickness of 4 mm or more on gallbladder in preoperative&#xD;
                     imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
                  3. Gallbladder with surrounding organs due to gallbladder inflammation&#xD;
&#xD;
                  4. Patients over 19 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. patients with elective gallbladder surgery (chronic cholecystitis)&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. gallbladder disease not inflammatory disease (GB cancer, GB polyp)&#xD;
&#xD;
                  3. pregnant women, patients under 18 years of age, over 70 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
                  4. patients with simultaneous surgery due to other organ diseases&#xD;

&#xD;
                  6. patients with hemorrhagic tendency, or with hematologic diseases&#xD;
&#xD;
                  7. Patients who underwent percutaneous cholecystectomy (PTGBD)&#xD;
&#xD;
                  8. Drain tube is required during surgery (eg. if delayed biliary leakage was&#xD;
                     concerned, hepatic duct injury was suspected or cystic duct ligation was&#xD;
                     incomplete during operation.)&#xD;
&#xD;
                E. Calculation and basis of the number of target subjects In the previous studies,&#xD;
                infectious complications after laparoscopic surgery for acute inflammatory&#xD;
                gallbladder disease are reported as 2.5%, so it was designed as a non-inferiority&#xD;
                experiment between the two groups.After assuming power 80% and 2-sided confidence&#xD;
                level 95%, the dropout rate was 10%. Considering this, 90 people were assigned to&#xD;
                each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
                F. Random allocation schedule and operation Randomization was performed using block&#xD;
                randomization without stratification, and a block size of 2, 4 or 6 was applied to&#xD;
                complete the randomization table to maintain unpredictability, which was the basic&#xD;
                principle of randomization. .&#xD;
&#xD;
                G. Assignment bags with random assignment numbers and assigned groups were made of&#xD;
                opaque material so that they could be blinded and remain sealed until random&#xD;
                assignment was performed for each subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
                H. The person in charge of the clinical trial or the person in charge of the&#xD;
                clinical trial finally checked the exclusion criteria and, if it was a suitable&#xD;
                subject, a random number was assigned and stored in the allocation bag. Thereafter,&#xD;
                the management pharmacist receives the assignment bag with the assignment number,&#xD;
                releases the seal of the assignment bag, and prescribes antibiotics according to&#xD;
                the administration group assigned to the subject according to each random&#xD;
                assignment number. Afterwards, the managed pharmacist brought the antibiotics&#xD;
                according to the newly developed drug code for the clinical trial in accordance&#xD;
                with the [Medical Clinical Trial Management Standards (related to Article 30,&#xD;
                Paragraph 1)], and then administered to the patient. The management pharmacist&#xD;
                should record the release information (release date and releaser) immediately after&#xD;
                the release of the assignment bag which the random assignment enveloped, when it&#xD;
                had already been released once, it could not reassign the randomization code to&#xD;
                other subjects even if the subject withdraws consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
                I. Clinical trial method (administration / dosage, administration / use method,&#xD;
                administration / use period, combination therapy, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. Research Design Prospective randomized controlled trial in two groups&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. Describe what treatment is performed for the experimental group / control&#xD;
                     group A. Clinical trial flow&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. Before the patient's surgery, hematology, blood chemistry, blood coagulation,&#xD;
                     urine, Chest X-ray, EKG, and Abdomen CT were performed in accordance with&#xD;
                     current clinical practice guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. Select the patient group that met the diagnostic criteria according to the&#xD;
                     test results above.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  3. Select a random patient group to determine the type of empirical antibiotic to&#xD;
                     use before surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
                  4. For each selected group, intravenous antibiotics (Cefazolin inj., 1 g,&#xD;
                     Cefazolin sodium versus. normal saline) were used as before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
                     - The clinical trial manager or the clinical trial manager finally checked the&#xD;
                     criteria for selection exclusion and, if it was a suitable subject, a random&#xD;
                     number was assigned and stored in the allocation bag. Thereafter, the&#xD;
                     management pharmacist received the assignment bag with the assignment number,&#xD;
                     released the seal of the assignment bag, and prescribed antibiotics according&#xD;
                     to the administration group assigned to the subject according to each random&#xD;
                     assignment number. Afterwards, the managed pharmacist brought the antibiotics&#xD;
                     according to the newly developed drug code for the clinical trial in&#xD;
                     accordance with the [Medical Clinical Trial Management Standards (related to&#xD;
                     Article 30, Paragraph 1)], and then administered to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  5. After surgery, both groups were discharged through the same recovery process&#xD;
                     after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  6. On the 1st day after surgery, hematology, blood chemistry, urine, blood&#xD;
                     clotting, and chest x-rays were performed. (Inspection and treatment were&#xD;
                     performed according to the current clinical pathway of gallbladder surgery)&#xD;
&#xD;
                  7. If there are no specifics, a fluid diet was performed starting from lunch on&#xD;
                     the first day after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  8. If there were no specifics, patient would be discharged on the second day&#xD;
                     after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  9. Stability and effectiveness were monitored during hospitalization and after&#xD;
                     discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
                B. Method of operation&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. Surgery was started under general anesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. A trocar of 10 mm was placed on the navel, 5 mm under the blade, and 5 mm&#xD;
                     trocar was placed on the right upper abdomen.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  3. Pneumoperitoneum was performed using CO2 gas in the abdominal cavity. - Double&#xD;
                     pressure through CO2 gas was maintained at 12mmHg / and 2L / min.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  4. Dissection started from Calot's triangle and the operation was performed by&#xD;
                     retrograde cholecystectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
                     - The cystic duct was ligated with a 10mm clip and the cystic artery was&#xD;
                     ligated with a 10mm clip as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
                     - If the cystic duct was unstablely ligated, ligation was performed through an&#xD;
                     endoloop.&#xD;
&#xD;
                     - After ligation, the gallbladder was dissected from the liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  5. Washed the surgical site.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  6. The excised gallbladder was placed in a laparoscopic pocket and extracted&#xD;
                     through the umbilicus.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  7. The trocar was removed, the skin was sutured, and the operation was completed.&#xD;
                     C. Discharge Principle&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. When hematologically stable and vital signs were stable&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. When the patient's condition was stable by proceeding to the normal diet&#xD;
&#xD;
                J. characteristics of observational and clinical test &lt;Observation test&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
                1) Medical history investigation Before entering the clinical trial, checked the&#xD;
                following items through interviews, chart and questions about the subject's&#xD;
                background (demographic information), medical history, etc., and recorded them in&#xD;
                the record.&#xD;
&#xD;
                (1) Background investigation: Subject's initials, date of birth, sex, feasibility&#xD;
                of pregnancy, pregnancy, lactation (2) medical history (3) History history: History&#xD;
                of other diseases 2) Physical examination, vital signs examination Investigators&#xD;
                checked whether the body organs were normal or abnormal through medical examination&#xD;
                and examination and any significant findings found during the examination should be&#xD;
                recorded in the physical examination column of the record sheet, and confirmed to&#xD;
                be suitable for participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
                After surgery, the pain level was measured by questioning the patient himself using&#xD;
                the VAS score, and the amount of analgesics (injection drugs; tramadol and oral&#xD;
                drugs; ircodon) administered after surgery to the patient was recorded through&#xD;
                medication records.&#xD;
&#xD;
                3) Clinical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
                It was performed during the hospitalization after decision to perform&#xD;
                cholecystectomy. Blood sampling for the subjects was performed aseptically.&#xD;
                Investigators recorded the test results, determined whether they were normal or&#xD;
                abnormal, and record the opinions of researchers regarding abnormal values.&#xD;
                Clinical tests included :&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. Hematology tests: Hematocrit, Hemoglobin, MCV, MCH, MCHC, Platelet, WBC &amp;&#xD;
                     Differential count, ESR&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. Blood coagulation test: PT INR, aPTT, BT&#xD;
&#xD;
                  3. Blood chemistry test: SGOT (AST), SGPT (ALT), alkaline phosphatase, γ-GTP,&#xD;

                     medical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. Before surgery, chest X-ray and electrocardiography were performed to evaluate&#xD;
                     whether surgery was possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. Imaging studies such as CT, Sonogram, and MRCP were conducted. 5)&#xD;
                     Postoperative hospital stay The day after surgery, hematology, blood&#xD;
                     chemistry, urine, blood clotting, Chest x-ray.&#xD;
&#xD;
                6) Check for infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Surgical site infection&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Confirmation at every patient visit. Troca insertion site was defined as&#xD;
                superficial surgical site infection if there was redness, heat sensation and&#xD;
                abscess.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. If there was fluid retention and abscess around the surgical site in the abdominal&#xD;
                cavity, it was defined as deep surgical site infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
                - Distant infection&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Respiratory, urinary system infections and bacteremia or lymphangitis 7) Check&#xD;
                     for leakage of bile.&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  Groups who had drainage catheter would be checked through the drainage&#xD;
                          pattern. In the group without drainage catheter, after surgery, if there&#xD;
                          is epigastric pain, indigestion, fever, and jaundice, a selective medical&#xD;
                          imaging test (CT, sonogram, MRCP) was performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
                          8) Surgery time, bleeding amount were described. 9) Postoperative&#xD;
                          complications (things other than those described above) were described.&#xD;
&#xD;
                K. Predicted side effects and precautions&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. Side effects that might occur in the experimental group (the first-generation&#xD;
                     cephalosporin use group)&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  Wound infections and deep infections : Since antibiotics were used, the&#xD;
                          possibility was very low.&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  Side effects of antibiotics (allergic reaction)&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. Side effects that could be occurred in the control group (2nd generation&#xD;
                     cephalosporin use group)&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  Extension of the period of stay&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  Increased hospitalization costs&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  Increase of multi-drug resistant bacteria&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  Side effects of antibiotics (allergic reaction) (In the event of side&#xD;
                          effects, medical judgment was used to actively select a therapeutic&#xD;
                          method.)&#xD;
&#xD;
                L. Stop or drop the test Dosing and testing should be discontinued if any of the&#xD;
                following occurs, and the reasons for discontinuation and findings should be&#xD;
                recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. After surgery, when a side effect that was life-threatening, the investigator&#xD;
                     determined that it was necessary to stop&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. When the patient refused or withdrew consent after starting the test&#xD;
&#xD;
                  3. If the patient was inadequate after starting the test&#xD;
&#xD;
                  4. After the start of the test, if patient had received treatment that might&#xD;
                     affect the course of treatment, such as other combination drugs and herbal&#xD;
                     treatments, without the permission of the test manager&#xD;
&#xD;
                  5. After the start of the test, it was judged that it was impossible to conduct&#xD;
                     inspection or investigation due to the circumstances&#xD;
&#xD;
                  6. After surgery, when surgery was required due to a disease of another organ not&#xD;
                     related to gallbladder surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
                M. Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. Analysis of validity variables A. Analysis of primary efficacy variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  During the postoperative hospital stay, the incidence of wound infection&#xD;
                          and deep infection rates in the group using the first-generation&#xD;
                          cephalosporin and normal saline as an empirical antibiotic before surgery&#xD;
                          was determined by the student's t-test or according to the satisfaction&#xD;
                          of the normal distribution assumption. Test using wilcoxn's rank sum&#xD;
                          test, and present the descriptive statistics (average, standard&#xD;
                          deviation, median, minimum, and maximum). Also, the difference in the&#xD;
                          incidence of infection between the two groups (test group-control group)&#xD;
                          was presented as the mean and 95% confidence interval, and if it was less&#xD;
                          than the non-inferiority limit of 13%, the group using the&#xD;
                          first-generation cephalosporin antibiotics was the second-generation&#xD;
                          cephalosporin. It was not inferior to the group using antibiotics. That&#xD;
                          was, it would decide that it was not inferior.&#xD;
&#xD;
                     B. Complications after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  Complications will be defined and analyzed through researchers'&#xD;
                          experience and review of existing literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
                            -  Fever after surgery: Fever of 37.5 ° C or more that lasts at least&#xD;
                               48 hours after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
                               ② Surgical site infection: In case of seroma, hematoma, or abscess&#xD;
                               in the surgical incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
                               ③ Surgery wound wound: When the wound was opened and opened.&#xD;
&#xD;
                               ④ Coming, vomiting after surgery: If patient needed to use&#xD;
                               antiemetic after 24 hours of surgery, or if patient had vomited even&#xD;
                               once.&#xD;
&#xD;
                               ⑤ Sustained shoulder pain after surgery: If patient complained of a&#xD;
                               stiff shoulder until the outpatient follow-up examination (one week&#xD;
                               after discharge).&#xD;
&#xD;
                               ⑥ Bleeding after surgery: When the patient's vital signs change or&#xD;
                               there was a decrease in Hb 2.0 or higher on the hemoglobin test the&#xD;
                               day after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
                                 -  Abscess in the abdominal cavity after surgery: When an abscess&#xD;
                                    in the abdominal cavity was confirmed by image examination&#xD;
                                    (ultrasound, CT, etc.) accompanied by fever and pain in the&#xD;
                                    physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
                                      -  Persistent bowel obstruction: If the meal could not be&#xD;
                                         started even after 2 days of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. Analysis of secondary efficacy variables In the case of categorical variables&#xD;
                     for the length of stay, surgical time, and complication data obtained as&#xD;
                     secondary endpoints, n (%) was presented, and the ratio difference between the&#xD;
                     two groups was tested using Chi-square or Fisher's exact test. In addition,&#xD;
                     for continuous variables, the mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and&#xD;
                     maximum values were presented, and the normality test was performed to test&#xD;
                     with Student's t-test for normal distribution, and for the non-normal&#xD;
                     distribution, Wilcoxon rank-sum test The difference between the two groups&#xD;
                     would be tested. All statistical analysis would use SPSS version 21.0, and it&#xD;
                     would be judged that it was statistically significant below the significance&#xD;
                     level of 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  3. Analysis target group&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. intention to treat analysis group Randomization would be performed only if the&#xD;
                     selection criteria described above were met, and all randomized subjects would&#xD;
                     be included in statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. per protocol analysis group The Per protocol analysis group was defined as a&#xD;
                     patient who had undergone randomization and had undergone chest imaging the&#xD;
                     next day after surgery, and whose pain had been assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
                4) How to deal with missing values This study was a prospective study, and it was&#xD;
                expected that there would be no missing values of the main or secondary endpoints&#xD;
                during the experiment. However, if a missing value occurred, the missing value was&#xD;
                substituted with the average value.&#xD;
&#xD;
                5) How to deal with compliance Since the intervention applied to this study was an&#xD;
                intervention performed during surgery while the patient had general anesthesia,&#xD;
                there would be no difference in treatment compliance. In addition, postoperative&#xD;
                thoracic imaging and pain assessment were also included in the clinical pathway for&#xD;
                laparoscopic cholecystectomy, so there was no difference in treatment compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
                N. Safety evaluation of side effects and reporting method In the event of adverse&#xD;
                reactions and adverse reactions after surgery, trained the subject to report to the&#xD;
                researcher, checked and recorded the occurrence of adverse reactions at each visit,&#xD;
                symptoms, appearance time, duration, severity of adverse reactions, and causal&#xD;
                relationship with the test drug Record in the report. In the event of a serious&#xD;
                adverse event or unexpected problem, the responsible researcher should report it to&#xD;
                the clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
                O. Compensation Protocol of victim Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was a safe&#xD;
                operation with a very low risk of surgery. Also, there are basically no additional&#xD;
                risks accompanying the study. Antibiotics were drugs that had been used before, so&#xD;
                there are no additional complications beyond the known complications. If patient&#xD;
                got injury or illness by participating in this study, medical treatment would be&#xD;
                provided. In order to receive medical treatment related to the clinical symptoms or&#xD;
                signs, investigators would make a quick diagnosis and receive treatment when needed&#xD;
                through consultation.&#xD;
