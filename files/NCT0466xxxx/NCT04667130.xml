      This study monitor the immediate and persistent impact of a preventive complex six-month&#xD;
      program specifically developed for newly diagnosed people with multiple sclerosis on fatigue,&#xD;
      mental and physical fitness, and quality of life. The study determined whether changes in&#xD;
      clinical function are related to changes in neurohormones, and whether the effect of therapy&#xD;
      is dependent on the active approach of study participants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patients who were newly diagnosed with MS underwent a six-month preventive comprehensive&#xD;
      program, which included individual physiotherapy focused on the treatment of functional&#xD;
      disorders of the loco-motor system and therapy on a neurophysiological basis, group&#xD;
      psychotherapy and controlled aerobic training. The participants were examined three times -&#xD;
      before the start of the physiotherapy program, immediately after its completion and six&#xD;
      months apart. Influence on physical fitness (spiroergometric examination), fatigue (Modify&#xD;
      Fatigue Impact Scale, fatigue scale for motor and cognitive functions), depression (Beck&#xD;
      scale for evaluation of depression), admission of disease RS (Inventory of admission of&#xD;
      multiple sclerosis, quality of life) life and selected neurohormones&#xD;
      (dehydroepiandrosterone-DHEA, dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate - DHEAS, cortisol).&#xD;

    <measure>Questionnaires - The Fatigue scale for motor and cognitive functions</measure>
    <time_frame>change after six months of the program and after next six moths without therapy is being assessed</time_frame>
    <description>FSMC - is an assessment of MS-related cognitive and motor fatigue. A Likert-type 5-point scale (ranging from 'does not apply at all' to 'applies completely') produces a score between 1 and 5 for each scored question. Thus minimum value is 20 (no fatigue at all) and maximum value is 100 (severest grade of fatigue).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Questionnaires - The Satisfaction With Life Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>change after six months of the program and after next six moths without therapy is being assessed</time_frame>
    <description>The scale measures the current level of satisfaction with one's own life. Investigators express the extent to which they agree or disagree with the five statements. The rating scale contains 7 points (1- &quot;strongly disagree&quot; and 7 - &quot;strongly agree&quot;). The maximum number of points on the scale is 35 (maximum satisfaction with your life) and the minimum number of points is 5 (dissatisfaction with your life).</description>

    <measure>Questionnaires - Multiple Sclerosis Acceptance Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>change after six months of the program and after next six moths without therapy is being assessed</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire consists of 20 statements that relate to the lives of patients with MS. The rating scale has seven points (1- &quot;never pays&quot; to 7 - &quot;always pays&quot;). The minimum value is 20 (minimum adaptation to the diagnosis of MS for a large limitation of the normal life of MS) and the maximum value is 140 points (maximum adaptation to the diagnosis of MS - without the limitation of the normal life of MS) .</description>

    <measure>Questionnaires - Beck Depression Inventory Score</measure>
    <time_frame>change after six months of the program and after next six moths without therapy is being assessed</time_frame>
    <description>questionnaire is divided into thirteen categories and patients select a statement in each category which best fits their current feelings on the scale ranged from 0 (the best feelings) to 3 (the worst feelings). The maximum value of the total scale is 39 and shows the worst feeling of the person.</description>

    <description>Preventive program included informations of the possibilities of physiotherapy in the treatment of multiple sclerosis focused on fatigue management - recommending lifestyle changes. Program included a the treatment of psychosomatic, viscerosomatic functional disorders by reflexively poor connection through the locomotor system using computer kinesiology, psychotherapy, manual therapy - where patients are corrected into a postural position and the joints are functionally centred, and aerobic exercise to influence fatigue and improve the performance of the cardiovascular system.</description>
