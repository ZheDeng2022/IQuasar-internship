  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      EP0057-201 is a Phase 2A/B adaptive design study. Phase 2A will test EP0057 in combination&#xD;
      with Olaparib and Phase 2B, the randomised part of the study, will test EP0057 in combination&#xD;
      with Olaparib against SOC chemotherapy. When EP0057 is combined with Olaparib, it is&#xD;
      envisaged that the combination should improve therapeutic responses in the recurrent ovarian&#xD;
      cancer disease setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EP0057 is an investigational nanoparticle-drug conjugate administered intravenously. The&#xD;
      rationale for developing EP0057 is to enable selective entry of EP0057 into tumour tissue and&#xD;
      as a result create preferential accumulation of EP0057, and therefore of the payload&#xD;
      Camptothecin, to translate into maximum tumour cell killing.&#xD;

      EP0057-201 is an adaptive Phase 2A/B study in patients with advanced ovarian cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2A&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2A will be comprised of 2 single-arm treatment cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1 will explore EP0057 in combination with Olaparib in patients with advanced platinum&#xD;
      resistant ovarian cancer (see inclusion criteria for definition of platinum resistant) who&#xD;
      are PARP inhibitor naive and who have received no more than 1 prior line of therapy which&#xD;
      must be platinum-based chemotherapy (n~=30)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2 will explore EP0057 in combination with Olaparib in patients with advanced ovarian&#xD;
      cancer who have received at least 1 prior line of therapy which must include at least 1 line&#xD;
      of platinum-based chemotherapy followed by a PARP inhibitor as maintenance treatment as their&#xD;
      last treatment regimen (n~=30)&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is anticipated that up to approximately 60 patients (approximately 30 patients per cohort)&#xD;
      will be enrolled into Phase 2A. Both treatment cohorts will open in parallel and patients&#xD;
      will be enrolled into each cohort concurrently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of Phase 2A, the Safety Review Committee will guide the decision to initiate 1 or&#xD;
      both cohorts in Phase 2B, or terminate further recruitment into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2B&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2B will be comprised of 2 treatment cohorts, each randomised versus SOC. One or both&#xD;
      cohorts may be opened concurrently to recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1 will explore EP0057 in combination with Olaparib compared with SOC chemotherapy&#xD;
      (TBC) in patients with advanced platinum resistant ovarian cancer who are PARP inhibitor&#xD;
      naive and who have received no more than 1 prior line of therapy which must be platinum-based&#xD;
      chemotherapy (n=~132)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2 will explore EP0057 in combination with Olaparib compared with SOC chemotherapy&#xD;
      (TBC) in patients with advanced ovarian cancer who have received at least 1 prior line of&#xD;
      therapy which must include at least 1 line of platinum-based chemotherapy followed by a PARP&#xD;
      inhibitor as maintenance treatment as their last therapy (n=~192)&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is anticipated that ~324 patients will be enrolled into Phase 2B. Both treatment cohorts&#xD;
      may open in parallel and patients may be enrolled into each cohort concurrently.&#xD;

             be a platinum-based chemotherapy, with maintenance of response by PARP inhibitor&#xD;
             lasting ≥ 6 months, with subsequent confirmed disease progression as defined by RECIST&#xD;

             require current therapy. Brain imaging must not be older than 12 weeks (at the start&#xD;

         14. Any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic conditions (e.g., severe hepatic&#xD;
             impairment) or current unstable or uncompensated respiratory or cardiac conditions&#xD;
             which makes it undesirable for the patient to participate in the study or which could&#xD;

&#xD;
             Completely resected carcinoma in situ of any type&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Any medical condition that would, in the investigator's judgment, prevent the&#xD;
             patient's participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns, compliance with&#xD;
             clinical study procedures, or interpretation of study results&#xD;
&#xD;
