  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a large pragmatic stepped-wedge trial of electronic health record (EHR)-based&#xD;
      implementation strategies informed by behavioral economic principles to increase&#xD;
      lung-protective ventilation (LPV) utilization among all mechanically ventilated (MV), adult&#xD;
      patients. The study will compare the standard approach to managing MV across 12 study&#xD;
      Intensive Care Units (ICUs) within University of Pennsylvania Health System (UPHS) versus&#xD;
      interventions prompting physicians and respiratory therapists (RTs) to employ LPV settings&#xD;
      promote LPV utilization among all MV patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a 5-arm, stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial of electronic health record&#xD;
      (EHR)-based implementation strategies set in 12 community and academic ICUs in 5 hospitals of&#xD;
      UPHS all currently using an EHR-based algorithm to identify patients with Acute Respiratory&#xD;
      Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and prompt physicians to employ LPV will sequentially add two of&#xD;
      three EHR-based implementation strategies to further promote LPV utilization among all MV&#xD;
      patients. ICUs will be randomly assigned to first receive either a default order set&#xD;
      (Strategy A) or physician-targeted accountable justification strategy (Strategy B). ICUs will&#xD;
      be assigned to one of six wedges using computerized random-number generation, thereby&#xD;
      determining the date on which they adopt their assigned EHR-based strategy. The first wedge&#xD;
      will begin in the fourth month of the trial phase, so that all hospitals will contribute a&#xD;
      minimum of 3 months of data prior to having adopted the implementation strategy. Six months&#xD;
      after adoption, ICUs will add on an RT-targeted accountable justification strategy (Strategy&#xD;
      C). By the end of the 27-month study period, all hospitals will have been utilizing two&#xD;
      strategies in combination for at least 3 months. This design enables comparisons of outcomes&#xD;
      before and after implementation within ICUs, as well as at a given point in time among ICUs&#xD;
      which will have been randomly assigned to different strategies. During the two months after&#xD;
      the implementation strategy rolls out in each ICU, researchers will perform semi-structured&#xD;
      interviews of all physicians and RTs who staff study ICUs. After intervention period, there&#xD;
      will be a 12 month observational period where ICUs will resume usual processes for care of&#xD;
      mechanically ventilated patients and no study intervention will occur.&#xD;

    <description>With the default order set strategy, some mechanical ventilation order settings will be pre-populated to be consistent with LPV, including the mode and tidal volume, automatically calculated as 6 cc/kg of the patient's ideal body weight (as determined by each patient's height and gender, which are entered into the EHR on admission). The physician will have the option to opt out of any of the specified LPV settings and select other values.</description>

    <description>When a physician enters a mechanical ventilation order for a tidal volume that is greater than 6 cc/kg ideal body weight, an alert will appear requiring the physician to enter a reason for choosing a setting inconsistent with LPV. Clinicians will be instructed to provide a reason for deviation from LPV settings and that their response will be maintained in the medical record. The physician will not be able to sign the mechanical ventilation order set until after a response is entered.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Aged 18 and over; AND&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Admission to 1 of the 12 participating ICUs; AND&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Undergoing mechanical ventilation&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The episode of MV lasts less than 12 hours, because we believe that the evidence-based&#xD;
             practice may not apply to these patients nor alter their outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The patient is on minimal settings for the entirety of MV, defined as a spontaneous&#xD;
             mode (e.g., pressure support ventilation) with pressure support &lt;10 Centimeters of&#xD;
             Water Column (cmH2O), AND positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) &lt;8 cmH20, AND&#xD;
             fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) &lt;50%, because the clinical significance of&#xD;
             spontaneous tidal volumes is unknown and low tidal volumes may not be beneficial or&#xD;
             desirable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Goals of care are documented as comfort measures only (as identified through their&#xD;
             &quot;code status&quot; field in the EHR) during the first 72 hours during episode of MV,&#xD;
             because mechanical ventilation is managed differently during care focused exclusively&#xD;
             on comfort and low tidal volume ventilation may not be appropriate, nor would it&#xD;
             likely influence clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. There is no height documented in the EHR at the time of initiation of MV, because we&#xD;
             will be unable to estimate ideal body weight, a necessary parameter to calculate the&#xD;
             primary outcome, and because they will not receive the interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The height documented is less than 4 feet, because the formula for ideal body weight&#xD;
             does not hold true below this height.&#xD;
