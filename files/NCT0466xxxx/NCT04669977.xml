  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN is common among cancer patients during or&#xD;
      after chemotherapy, and the currently available drugs cannot effectively manage the symptoms.&#xD;
      Besides, CIPN causes fatigue, anxiety, and depression. CIPN is featured by the interference&#xD;
      of interleukin (IL) pathways, among which escalation of IL-17 is predominant, suggesting that&#xD;
      IL-17 may be manipulated to reduce the inflammation or the immunological disturbance.&#xD;
      Cyanidin, a type of glucosides, has been proved to behave like an IL-17 inhibitor. We have&#xD;
      identified a food material that contains large amounts of glucosides and rutinosides -&#xD;
      mulberry juice. The current proposal aims to explore the effect of this IL-17 inhibitor-rich&#xD;
      material in CIPN and related symptoms. We plan to divide the potential participants into&#xD;
      severe pain and mild pain group to conduct two human studies. A single-blinded randomized&#xD;
      controlled design is adopted to compare the effects of this crude material between the&#xD;
      experimental group and the control group in (1) pain and CIPN of the severe pain participants&#xD;
      and (2) fatigue, anxiety, and depression in the mild pain participants. IL and other immune&#xD;
      markers will be tested as evidence of improvement of inflammation status. We expect a&#xD;
      decrement in pain, CIPN, fatigue, anxiety, and depression severity with the intake of this&#xD;
      IL-17 inhibitor-rich material among cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer is at least partially attributable to immunological disturbance, and its treatment&#xD;
      causes additional inflammatory problems. Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN),&#xD;
      especially that induced by oxaliplatin or Taxanes (including paclitaxel and docetaxel) is&#xD;
      common among cancer patients during or after the treatment of chemotherapeutic agents,&#xD;
      presented as pain and sensory abnormalities for months, and even persists for years in some&#xD;
      patients after the cessation of chemotherapy. Even worse is that currently available drugs&#xD;
      cannot effectively manage these conditions. Besides, CIPN causes fatigue, anxiety, and&#xD;
      depression, which lower patients' quality of life and determination to fight the disease.&#xD;
      Interestingly, CIPN is featured by the interference of interleukin (IL) pathways, among which&#xD;
      escalation of IL-17 is predominant, suggesting that IL-17 may be manipulated to reduce the&#xD;
      inflammation or the immunological disturbance. Cyanidin, a type of glucosides, has been&#xD;
      proved to behave like an IL-17 inhibitor and works in an animal model of skin hyperplasia in&#xD;
      reducing the IL-17 levels and severity of hyperplasia. We have identified a food material&#xD;
      that contains large amounts of glucosides and rutinosides - mulberry juice. Preliminary&#xD;
      findings of an ongoing human study of our team have provided statistical evidence that this&#xD;
      crude material effectively relieves clinical symptoms of a disorder associated with&#xD;
      inflammation features. The current proposal aims to explore the effect of this IL-17&#xD;
      inhibitor-rich material in CIPN and related symptoms. To avoid confounding effects from pain,&#xD;
      we plan to divide the potential participants into severe pain and mild pain group to conduct&#xD;
      two human studies. A single-blinded randomized controlled design is adopted to compare the&#xD;
      effects of this crude material between the experimental group and the control group in (1)&#xD;
      pain and CIPN of the severe pain participants and (2) fatigue, anxiety, and depression in the&#xD;
      mild pain participants. IL and other immune markers will be tested as evidence of improvement&#xD;
      of inflammation status. We expect a decrement in pain, CIPN, fatigue, anxiety, and depression&#xD;
      severity with the intake of this IL-17 inhibitor-rich material among cancer patients&#xD;
      undergoing chemotherapy.&#xD;

    <description>One bottle (600ml/bottle) of sanitized mulberry juice would be sent to participants of the auxiliary group with instructions to consume 50ml of juice diluted with drinking water at room temperature. They are expected to finish the mulberry juice in 10 to 11 days. Measurements of clinical symptoms and blood sampling are conducted on day 1 of every other week for 5 weeks. If clinical measurements or blood extractions fail or miss, a substitute assessment or blood sample will be obtained on day 2 or day 3. The research period for these participants is 29 days (4 weeks). The checkpoints are arranged because patients with oxaliplatin treatment visit the clinic every two weeks, and patients with paclitaxel treatment visit the clinic every week. For patients having docetaxel therapy, the research period is 43 days (6 weeks) because docetaxel is administered every three weeks.</description>
