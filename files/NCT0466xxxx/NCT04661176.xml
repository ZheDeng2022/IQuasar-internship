  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The miR Scientific Sentinel™ Prostate Cancer Classifier Platform (Sentinel™ PCC4 Assay) is a&#xD;
      new molecular assay that interrogates 442 small non-coding RNAs extracted from urinary&#xD;
      exosomes and provides urologists an early, very precise indication of disease status in men&#xD;
      presenting with suspicion of prostate cancer. The assay classifies the disease status as&#xD;
      having no molecular evidence of prostate cancer (NMEPC) or molecular evidence of low-,&#xD;
      intermediate- or high-risk of aggressive, potentially lethal prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the clarity of explanation of the biological&#xD;
      background and clinical impact of the Sentinel™ PCC4 Assay, and the comfort level of&#xD;
      urologists with the clinical data and report form, including the ease of understanding of&#xD;
      results, and the potential use in clinical management of prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Men being seen by urologists in the course of their normal practice, presenting with&#xD;
      suspicion of prostate cancer (based on DRE and/or elevated Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA))&#xD;
      and scheduled for core-needle biopsy will be asked to consent to the clinical study and&#xD;
      provide one or more 50 mL sample of non-DRE urine along with relevant anonymized clinical&#xD;
      data with the study team. The urine samples will be shipped to miR Scientific laboratories in&#xD;
      Rensselaer NY, for exosomal sncRNA extraction and interrogation. The molecular status of the&#xD;
      participant will be reported as a Sentinel™ PCC4 Risk Level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second primary objective of this study is to establish the performance characteristics of&#xD;
      the Sentinel™ PCC4 Assay in the Puerto Rican population for identifying men with NMEPC, and&#xD;
      men with evidence of high-risk prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive the standard of care (SOC), including measurement of PSA, DRE and&#xD;
      TRUS-guided systematic or MRI-guided targeted biopsy. Based on the histopathology report of&#xD;
      the core-needle biopsy, read by pathologists associated with local institution, participants&#xD;
      with no positive cores will be designated &quot;cancer-free&quot;; otherwise patients with cancer in&#xD;
      one or more cores will have the clinical data associated with the SOC collected (including&#xD;
      the Gleason grade group, tumor staging, PSA, race and CAPRA risk assessment score). The CAPRA&#xD;
      score will be compared to the molecular classification provided by the Sentinel™ PCC4 Assay.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Sentinel™ PCC4 Assay is a new molecular classification technology that provides an&#xD;
      assessment of prostate cancer risk of advanced disease based on the expression of a cohort of&#xD;
      442 small non-coding RNAs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the start of the study, miR Scientific will schedule a teleconference call with all of the&#xD;
      participating physicians in Puerto Rico (San Juan Bautista Hospital) to outline the study,&#xD;
      the basis for the test and to explain the differences between this Sentinel™ PCC4 Assay and&#xD;
      the calculators commonly used in risk assessment for prostate cancer (the CAPRA and/or&#xD;
      D'Amico risk calculators and any other risk assessment methodology the uro-oncologists&#xD;
      utilize on a routine basis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the clinical data (see CRF form) and Sentinel™ result have been compiled for each of&#xD;
      the first 50 patients who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria, the CSO and/or Medical&#xD;
      Director of miR Scientific will chair one or more teleconference call with the participating&#xD;
      physicians to compare the results of the Sentinel™ Assay and the CAPRA and other risk&#xD;
      assessment calculators, discuss the relative strengths and weaknesses of the tests and answer&#xD;
      any questions regarding the performance of the Sentinel™ Assay and discordances (if any)&#xD;
      between the test results. It is important to note that while the clinical data and the&#xD;
      Sentinel Score are affiliated with specific barcodes, these data are fully anonymized and&#xD;
      cannot be associated with specific patients. In addition to preserving the PHI&#xD;
      confidentiality, this also ensures that the information related to the Sentinel™ Score will&#xD;
      not influence the current standard of care for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of each session, the participating physicians will complete a questionnaire&#xD;
      designed to evaluate the quality of the training and information related to the test result.&#xD;
      This process will be repeated for every 50 new patients enrolled for the first 200 patients&#xD;
      and then again after the data for 350 patients becomes available. The analysis of the&#xD;
      complete data set for the 500 patient cohort will also be presented at the completion of the&#xD;
      study, and a final questionnaire will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To validate the performance of the miR Sentinel™ PCC4 Assay for identifying patients with&#xD;
      prostate cancer in men of age 45-75 years with suspicion of prostate cancer for whom a&#xD;
      core-needle biopsy is performed, the miR Sentinel™ PCC4 results with low-, intermediate- and&#xD;
      high-risk prostate cancer (Grade Group 1, 2 or 3-5) will be compared to the results of the&#xD;
      CAPRA score. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV)&#xD;
      will be established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical utility study is a prospective, observational, validation study. Patients&#xD;
      between the age of 45-75-year who will have a prostate core needle biopsy and meet the&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria listed below will be enrolled provided that they have provided a&#xD;
      urine sample prior to biopsy. Using the Pathological Grade Group system, the results of each&#xD;
      biopsy will be grouped as either no cancer, CAPRA low-, intermediate- or high-risk by the&#xD;
      pathologists at the participating centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The miR Sentinel™ PCC4 Assay uses a proprietary Classification Algorithm to produce a&#xD;
      Sentinel™ PCC4 classification into one of four groups: NMEPC, low-, intermediate-, high-risk&#xD;
      prostate cancer. The PCC4 Assay controls sensitivity of the diagnosis and prognosis of a&#xD;
      future patient with unknown disease status at a desired level, usually at least 95%. The&#xD;
      proprietary Algorithm has been trained on a dataset consisting of: (1) control subjects who&#xD;
      presented in urology for conditions unrelated to prostate cancer; (2) subjects with suspicion&#xD;
      of prostate cancer assumed to not have prostate cancer based on the negative biopsy results;&#xD;
      and (3) patients diagnosed with prostate cancer and whose core needle biopsy histopathology&#xD;
      was reported as Grade Groups 1 through 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The performance of the miR Sentinel™ PCC4 Assay to classify the disease status of a future&#xD;
      patient as either prostate cancer or no prostate cancer and for patients with prostate cancer&#xD;
      as having low-risk (nominally Grade Group 1), intermediate-risk prostate cancer (nominally&#xD;
      Grade Group 2) or high-risk prostate cancer (nominally Grade Group 3-5) will be established.&#xD;
      The test reports will be provided to the consulting urologists who will also have the core&#xD;
      needle biopsy reports. The discordances between core needle biopsies and the Sentinel™ PCC4&#xD;
      Assay are well documented in Wang et al. (2020). At the start of the study the urologists&#xD;
      will be briefed on the interpretation of the Sentinel™ PCC4 Assay, and will subsequently be&#xD;
      asked to compare and contrast the information provided by the Sentinel™ PCC4 and the SOC (PSA&#xD;
      +/- DRE and pathology report), using a validated questionnaire. To ensure that urologists&#xD;
      associated with the project understand the Sentinel™ PCC4 platform, a review of the&#xD;
      comparative results will be held when the first 50 patients have been accrued, and again for&#xD;
      every additional 50 patients until 200 patients are accrued, and when 350 and 500 patients&#xD;
      have been accrued, at which time the trial will have completed its enrollment. The survey&#xD;
      instrument will be administered after each review to determine whether familiarity with the&#xD;
      Sentinel™ PCC4 Assay imbues confidence in the risk assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definitions. The general notation P (A | B) = P(A , B)/P(B) is the probability of the event A&#xD;
      given that the event B occurred; it is the probability (prevalence) of the event A among the&#xD;
      subgroup of patients in a population encompassing all who have the event B.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sensitivity = P (screening test + | truly disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Specificity = P (screening test - | truly no disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. PPV = P (truly disease | screening test +).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. NPV = P (truly no disease | screening test -).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimate of Sample Size. The proposed prospective study will serve to establish the&#xD;
      performance of the miR Sentinel™ PCC4 Assay on a representative sample of patients with any&#xD;
      suspicion of prostate cancer for whom a core needle biopsy is ordered. The miR Sentinel™ PCC4&#xD;
      Assay is trained on retrospective data as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current proposed study is targeted to enroll at most 500 subjects between the age of&#xD;
      45-75 years who receive a core-needle biopsy and who provided a urine sample prior to biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For any subgroup with a minimum of 100 enrolled participants, if the observed (empirical)&#xD;
      sensitivity of the PCC4 Assay for that subgroup is 95%, then the one-sided upper 95%&#xD;
      confidence interval for the true population sensitivity will be 90% or greater.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective study will continue to enroll participants until the first of either 500&#xD;
      total participants are enrolled, or at least 100 participants have enrolled in each of the&#xD;
      four groups: NEPC; Grade Group 1; Grade Group 2; Grade Group 3 and above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methodology. As outlined below, this clinical study will enroll patients between&#xD;
      the ages of 45 and 75 years that are scheduled for a core needle biopsy based on any&#xD;
      suspicion of prostate cancer. The study will evaluate the properties of the Sentinel™ PCC4&#xD;
      Assay that is based on use of a proprietary Classification Algorithm to identify future&#xD;
      patients with prostate cancer and to classify the risk of prostate cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proprietary Classification Algorithm employed controls sensitivity for both identifying&#xD;
      patients with prostate cancer and identifying high-risk prostate cancer at, or above, a&#xD;
      pre-specified level, denoted 1-α; for example, the value that has been assumed in this design&#xD;
      is α=0.05 so that sensitivity is at least 95% in the population. Note that the value of α&#xD;
      represents the false-negative rate of the assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To describe how the cut-offs for the Sentinel™ PCC4 Assay are calculated to control&#xD;
      sensitivity, for each participant in the training dataset, the Sentinel™ PCC4 Assay result&#xD;
      will be calculated using the remaining members of the training dataset and only the current&#xD;
      participant's sncRNA sequence; that is, the true disease status of each participant in the&#xD;
      training dataset will be blinded, thereby mimicking the setting for classification of a&#xD;
      future patient. The tuning parameters used in the miR Sentinel™ PCC4 Assay are then&#xD;
      calculated so that the empirical sensitivity over participants in the training dataset with&#xD;
      prostate cancer and with high-grade prostate cancer correspond to the value that provides an&#xD;
      upper one-sided 95% confidence interval for the corresponding population sensitivity for a&#xD;
      future patient of at least 1-α.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With these cut-offs for the Sentinel™ PCC4 Assay determined a priori from the training&#xD;
      dataset, the corresponding values of sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative&#xD;
      predictive values will be calculated, along with a corresponding upper 95% confidence&#xD;
      intervals, on the prospective patient data accrued in this proposed study, with each biopsy&#xD;
      result blinded, that is using only the participant's sncRNA sequence. Note that these error&#xD;
      rates refer to the classification of a future patient with unknown disease status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical analysis of the prospective data accrued that blinds the group label from&#xD;
      biopsy will provide an estimate of the proportion of patients that are mis-labeled by biopsy&#xD;
      in the prospective dataset. For example, patients labeled as having no prostate cancer by&#xD;
      biopsy and whose blinded miR Sentinel™ PCC4 Assay result indicates prostate cancer may be a&#xD;
      patient that was potentially a false negative by core-needle biopsy (biopsy label negative).&#xD;
      The validation of this discordance and others are addressed below in the follow-up data&#xD;
      analysis section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Data Analysis. If a follow-up biopsy is scheduled for participants with negative&#xD;
      biopsies as part of their standard clinical care, the follow-up Sentinel Assay and biopsy&#xD;
      results will be deemed as the clinical truth for the outcome analysis.&#xD;
