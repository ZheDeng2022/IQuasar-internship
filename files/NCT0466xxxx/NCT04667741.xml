  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) can experience symptoms such as lassitude, pain, muscle&#xD;
      cramps, nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, rash, skin dryness, sleep disorders, and&#xD;
      emotional and sexual problems after the treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many chronic HD patients do not feel well after the treatment sessions and need some time to&#xD;
      recover. This recovery time is defined as the time required to recover from the feelings of&#xD;
      lassitude and fatigue. The patients are limited in their daily living activities at home and&#xD;
      at work during this period and a significant amount of time is therefore required to go back&#xD;
      to normal life.&#xD;
