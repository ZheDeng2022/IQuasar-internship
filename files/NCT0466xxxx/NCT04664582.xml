      Current guidelines in management of regional lymph node metastases for cSCC patients include&#xD;
      surgical resection with or without adjuvant therapy as well as chemotherapy and&#xD;
      interdisciplinary management; in advanced disease, supportive and palliative care is&#xD;
      recommended. These guidelines also define the role of SLNB in management of high-risk cSCC as&#xD;
      unclear and suggest further studies need to determine its utility and indications11.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, routine practice of performing SLNB in cSCC varies across Quebec and within&#xD;
      Canada. At many institutions, SLNB is not routinely performed on patients with cSCC. The&#xD;
      current standard of treatment is to observe closely when a patient is deemed to have a&#xD;
      high-risk cancer, and if they have clinical or radiological findings of lymphadenopathy, a&#xD;
      formal surgical neck dissection is performed. Given the comorbidities and risks involved in&#xD;
      treatment of regional lymph nodes in cSCC, the role of SLNB in cSCC patients needs further&#xD;
      clarification. This multicentre prospective study aims to better clarify this role and&#xD;
      formulate suggested criteria for its indications.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma (cSCC) is a malignant neoplasm that arises from epidermal&#xD;
      keratinocytes. It is the second most commonly seen nonmelanoma skin cancer after basal cell&#xD;
      carcinoma (BCC) and is one of the most common malignancies in the world. The annual incidence&#xD;
      of nonmelanoma skin cancers exceed all other malignancies combined. It also has a&#xD;
      predilection for the head and neck, due to being a common location for sun-exposed skin.&#xD;
      While incidences of both BCC and squamous cell carcinoma are increasing worldwide, cSCC is&#xD;
      increasing even more disproportionately. This increase in skin cancer trends is likely due to&#xD;
      a combination of factors including increased sun exposure along with increasing life&#xD;
      expectancies. Furthermore, unlike BCC which tends to have an indolent course and is rarely&#xD;
      metastatic, cSCC has more metastatic potential than BCC. While the vast majority of cSCC&#xD;
      cases can be treated with curative intent without complication, there are a certain subset of&#xD;
      cSCC which behave aggressively with significant risk for local recurrence and distant&#xD;
      metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many retrospective studies have tried to define &quot;high-risk&quot; features in cSCC that are&#xD;
      predictive of regional and distant metastasis or poor survival, including local recurrence,&#xD;
      depth of invasion, larger size, perineural and lymphovascular invasion, poor differentiation,&#xD;
      and immunosuppression. Despite this, there is poor concordance in current guidelines on which&#xD;
      patient and tumor characteristics constitute high-risk features. These include discrepancies&#xD;
      between major guiding associations, such as the American Joint Committee on Cancer and&#xD;
      National Comprehensive Cancer Network Clinical Practice Guidelines. Ultimately, a consensus&#xD;
      on the definition of high-risk features of cSCC is necessary in order to produce practical&#xD;
      and precise guidelines to enhance patient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy (SLNB) is an established prognostic procedure in determining the&#xD;
      degree of spread of malignant cells. It is used widely in skin cancers such as melanoma, with&#xD;
      consistent recommended guidelines by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and&#xD;
      Society of Surgical Oncology (SSO). However, no such guideline currently exists for cSCC and&#xD;
      recommendations for its routine use is conflicting in the literature. There exist many&#xD;
      studies concerning the use of SLNB in cSCC, most of which are small and retrospective in&#xD;
      nature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two systematic reviews on the subject both revealed that prospective studies documenting&#xD;
      high-risk features were necessary. A meta-analysis that included 36 studies by Thompson et&#xD;
      al. narrowed down tumor depth and tumor diameter as having the most significant risk ratio&#xD;
      for recurrence, metastasis, and disease-specific death in cSCC respectively. However, they&#xD;
      also concluded that unified, consistent collection and reporting of risk factors in a&#xD;
      prospective, multicentered effort was needed. Lastly, a multi-institutional prospective study&#xD;
      was performed by Mooney at al between 2010-2017. While the study was well designed, they only&#xD;
      looked at 5 tumor characteristics, including tumor site, diameter, depth, differentiation and&#xD;
      invasion. It also appears that they used a blue dye technique for SLNB over radioactive&#xD;
      tracer methods preferred at other institutions. They conclude that significant predictors of&#xD;
      metastasis were four or more high-risk features, which may be vague depending on which&#xD;
      predictors the treating team is considering. Furthermore, the generalizability of the study&#xD;
      may be limited due to including only Australian institutions. No prospective&#xD;
      multi-institutional studies have looked at a North American patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective multicentre study aims to clarify the role of SLNB in cSCC by identifying&#xD;
      patient and tumour characteristics for candidacy criteria in SLNB indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RATIONALE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the introduction of SLNB by Morton and Cochran in the 1990s, many studies and trials&#xD;
      were run to determine its role and indications, particularly in melanoma. Three landmark&#xD;
      trials, MSLT-I, DeCOG-SLT and MSLT-II, among other studies, lead to the creation of SLNB&#xD;
      guidelines by ASCO and SSO for melanoma patients. SLNB has been shown to provide substantial&#xD;
      prognostic information as well as possible therapeutic effects in some cases; whereas&#xD;
      Completion Lymph Node Dissection (CLND) has been demonstrated not to provide any survival&#xD;
      benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current guidelines in management of regional lymph node metastases for cSCC patients include&#xD;
      surgical resection with or without adjuvant therapy as well as chemotherapy and&#xD;
      interdisciplinary management; in advanced disease, supportive and palliative care is&#xD;
      recommended. These guidelines also define the role of SLNB in management of high-risk cSCC as&#xD;
      unclear and suggest further studies need to determine its utility and indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, routine practice of performing SLNB in cSCC varies across Quebec and within&#xD;
      Canada. At many institutions, SLNB is not routinely performed on patients with cSCC. The&#xD;
      current standard of treatment is to observe closely when a patient is deemed to have a&#xD;
      high-risk cancer, and if they have clinical or radiological findings of lymphadenopathy, a&#xD;
      formal surgical neck dissection is performed. Given the comorbidities and risks involved in&#xD;
      treatment of regional lymph nodes in cSCC, the role of SLNB in cSCC patients needs further&#xD;
      clarification. This multicentre prospective study aims to better clarify this role and&#xD;
      formulate suggested criteria for its indications.&#xD;
