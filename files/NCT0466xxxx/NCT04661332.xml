  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of the pathology of the extrahepatic biliary tract is the most frequent indication&#xD;
      for performing endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERCP). The method, which combines&#xD;
      endoscopic and radiological vision, also allows for therapeutic (and diagnostic) procedures&#xD;
      on some pathologies of the pancreas and the papilla of Vater.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the maneuvers it is also possible to obtain cyto-histological material for the&#xD;
      diagnosis of any lesions identified, through the execution of brushing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The endoscope used for ERCP allows for microsurgical procedures to be performed on the&#xD;
      papilla of Vater, on the biliary tract and on the pancreas, procedures that in the past&#xD;
      required a real surgical intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ERCP is a generally well tolerated procedure, but as with all medical procedures it can have&#xD;
      limitations and be followed by some complications. In 5% of cases, the procedure may not be&#xD;
      completed due to anatomical variants that do not allow the endoscope to reach the duodenum or&#xD;
      to cannulate and visualize the bile and / or pancreatic ducts. The most frequent complication&#xD;
      is acute pancreatitis, which can arise as a consequence of surgery on the common outlet of&#xD;
      the biliary and pancreatic tracts; it occurs in 3-5% of cases and to date, it cannot be&#xD;
      predicted or prevented in all cases. In some groups of patients (young, with non-dilated&#xD;
      biliary tract, or with a history of previous pancreatitis) the risk of pancreatitis can reach&#xD;
      10-12% . In rare cases (less than 1%), pancreatitis can have a severe course and may require&#xD;
      surgery. Other less frequent complications (with an overall incidence of less than 2%) are:&#xD;
      infection of the biliary tract or cystic collections, bleeding resulting from&#xD;
      papillo-sphincterotomy, and perforation of the duodenum or ducts. Infection and bleeding are&#xD;
      generally treated medically or endoscopically; the perforation may require surgery in some&#xD;
      cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This registry aims to collect in a prospective and / or retrospective way the data of the&#xD;
      ERCP procedures performed in our center by evaluating the sex, age of the patient, the reason&#xD;
      why the patient was subjected to the examination, diagnosis, clinical risk factors and&#xD;
      technical risk (i.e. associated with the procedure itself), if there have been complications,&#xD;
      the type of instrumentation in use in our operating unit and / or the operators performing&#xD;
      the examinations.&#xD;
