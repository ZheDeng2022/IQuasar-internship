    <textblock>
      This study is for patients that have a type of lymph gland disease called Hodgkin or&#xD;
      non-Hodgkin Lymphoma or T/NK-lymphoproliferative disease or severe chronic active Epstein&#xD;
      Barr Virus (CAEBV) which has come back or has not gone away after treatment, including the&#xD;
      best treatment the investigators know for these diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some patients with Lymphoma or T/NK-lymphoproliferative disease or CAEBV show signs of virus&#xD;
      that is sometimes called Epstein Barr virus (EBV) that causes mononucleosis or glandular&#xD;
      fever (&quot;mono&quot;) before or at the time of their diagnosis. EBV is found in the cancer cells of&#xD;
      up to half the patients with Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, suggesting that plays a role&#xD;
      in causing Lymphoma. The cancer cells (in lymphoma) and some immune system cells (in CAEBV)&#xD;
      infected by EBV are able to hide from the body's immune system and escape destruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill&#xD;
      other cells, including cells infected with viruses and tumor cells. T cells have been used to&#xD;
      treat patients with cancers. T cells, that have been trained to kill EBV infected cells can&#xD;
      survive in the blood and affect the tumor. The investigators have treated over 80 people on&#xD;
      studies using T cells to target these diseases. About half of those patients who had disease&#xD;
      at the time they got the cells had responses including some patients with complete responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators think that if T cells are able to last longer in the body, they may have a&#xD;
      better chance of killing EBV and EBV infected tumor cells. Therefore, in this study the&#xD;
      investigators will add a new gene to the EBV T cells that can cause the cells to live longer&#xD;
      called C7R. The investigators know that T cells need substances called cytokines to survive&#xD;
      and the cells may not get enough cytokines after infusion into the body. The investigators&#xD;
      have added the gene C7R that gives the cells a constant supply of cytokine and helps them to&#xD;
      survive for a longer period of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to find the largest safe dose of C7R-EBV T cells, and&#xD;
      additionally to evaluate how long they can be detected in the blood and what affect they have&#xD;
      on cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patient will donate blood in order to make C7R-EBV T cells. Depending on how long ago the&#xD;
      cells were generated, they have been frozen. To get the C7R to be made by the T-cell, the&#xD;
      investigators inserted a gene into the T-cell. This is done using certain parts of a virus&#xD;
      (known as a retrovirus) that can carry the gene into the T cells. Because patients receive&#xD;
      cells with a new gene in them, they will befollowed for a total of 15 years to see if there&#xD;
      are any long term side effects of gene transfer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When they are enrolled in this study, patients are assigned a dose of C7R EBV T cells. The&#xD;
      assigned dose of cells is based on body weight and height. Patients will receive the C7R EBV&#xD;
      T cells and may also receive cyclophosphamide and fludarabine (these are standard&#xD;
      chemotherapy medicines). The chemotherapy medicines may be given before the T cells to make&#xD;
      space in the blood for the T cells to grow after receiving them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient receives chemotherapy medicines, these drugs will be given through an i.v.&#xD;
      needle inserted in the patient's vein or central line) for 2 days and then fludarabine alone&#xD;
      on the third day. The patient will be given an injection of C7R EBV T cells into the vein&#xD;
      through an IV line at the assigned dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may receive Benadryl and Tylenol. The infusion will take between 1 and 10 minutes.&#xD;
      The investigators will then monitor the patient in the clinic or hospital for about 2 hours.&#xD;
      The treatment will be given by the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy at Texas Children's&#xD;
      Hospital or Houston Methodist Hospital. Patients should plan to stay in Houston for up to 2&#xD;
      weeks after the infusion so the investigators can monitor them for side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have follow-up visits with the clinic (at scheduled visits weeks 2 and 6, and&#xD;
      nursing follow-up at weeks 1, 2, 4, and 6; months 3, 6, 9, and 12; and annually for the next&#xD;
      15 years). Patients will have scheduled disease evaluations after the T-cell injection (at&#xD;
      week 6 +/- 2 weeks and then as clinically needed). After the disease re-evaluation, if the&#xD;
      patient's disease has not gotten worse, or if in the future it seems he/she might benefit,&#xD;
      they may be eligible to receive one additional dose of the T cells. The dose will be at the&#xD;
      same dose level as the patient's first infusion and separated by at least 6 weeks such that&#xD;
      the investigators can make sure that the patient has no severe side effects between&#xD;
      infusions. If the patient receives an additional dose of C7R EBV T-cells, they will need to&#xD;
      stay in Houston for up to 2 weeks after the infusion as well so the investigators can monitor&#xD;
      them for side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical tests before treatment--&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before being treated, the patient will receive a series of standard medical tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurements of the tumor by routine imaging studies. The investigators will use the&#xD;
           imaging studies that have been used in the past to best assess the patient's tumor&#xD;
           (Computer Tomogram (CT) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and Positron Emission&#xD;
           Tomography (PET/CT) and/or Bone Scan).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical tests during and after treatment--&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will receive standard medical tests when they are getting the infusions and&#xD;
      afterwards:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exams&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurements of the tumor by routine imaging studies approximately 6 weeks after the&#xD;
           infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn more about the way the C7R EBV T cells are working and how long they last in the&#xD;
      body, an extra amount of blood will be obtained on the day that chemotherapy starts, the day&#xD;
      of the T-cell infusion(s) and at the end of the T-cell infusion(s), 1, 2, 4, 6 weeks after&#xD;
      the T-cell infusion(s) and every 3 months for the 1st year, and annually for the next 15&#xD;
      years and possibly at additional time points. The amount of blood taken will be based on the&#xD;
      patient's weight with up to a maximum of 60 mL (12 teaspoons) of blood to be obtained at any&#xD;
      one time. For children, the total amount of blood drawn will not be more than 3 mL (less than&#xD;
      1 teaspoon) per 1 kg (2 lbs) of body weight on any one day. This volume is considered safe,&#xD;
      but may be decreased if the patient is anemic (have a low red blood cell count).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient has a procedure where tumor samples are obtained, like a repeat bone marrow&#xD;
      evaluation or tumor biopsy, the investigators request a sample to be used for research&#xD;
      purposes. Patients will receive supportive care for any acute or chronic toxicities,&#xD;
      including blood components or antibiotics, and other intervention as appropriate.&#xD;
