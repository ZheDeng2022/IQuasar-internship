  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preterm births are defined as delivery prior to 37 weeks gestation and account for 35% of&#xD;
      infant deaths in the first year of life. Early preterm birth are deliveries prior to 32 weeks&#xD;
      gestation and account for more than 70% of neonatal deaths and 36.1% of overall infant&#xD;
      mortality. Women who have delivered a preterm infant and who have a short pregnancy interval&#xD;
      (time between giving birth and subsequent conception) have an increased risk of preterm birth&#xD;
      in subsequent pregnancies. The investigators hope to understand if a mobile health strategy&#xD;
      can be used to reduce spontaneous preterm births via improved patient engagement, care&#xD;
      coordination, and adherence to recommended care vs a traditional paper-based health strategy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hope to learn how to engage pregnant women at risk for preterm births and&#xD;
      reduce the incidence of preterm births through this study. The goal of this study is to&#xD;
      reduce the risk of recurrent preterm births for the participating mothers and healthy&#xD;
      development of their infants. The investigators hope that this study will accomplish the&#xD;
      following for the mothers: Utilize technology to strengthen knowledge of healthy behaviors;&#xD;
      Improve adherence to both behavioral and medical interventions that specifically aimed at&#xD;
      reducing the risk of spontaneous recurrent preterm births; Develop a platform that can&#xD;
      capture participant behavior regarding the participant's lifestyle, environment, social&#xD;
      factors, and personal health status; Allow participants to be co-creators of content, thus&#xD;
      creating a support network. The investigators hope to achieve improvements in the following&#xD;
      primary outcome: Inter-pregnancy interval and the following secondary outcomes: postpartum&#xD;
      depression, infant-mother bonding and breast milk feeding between the control and the&#xD;
      intervention groups. Ultimately, the investigators hope improvements in these outcomes will&#xD;
      improve secondary prevention of preterm births and ultimately reduce infant mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, PretermConnect will monitor mothers on their social circumstances, such as&#xD;
      housing and food insecurity, family employment status, and perceived importance of&#xD;
      recommended care for the baby's and the participant's own health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators also want to observe if a mobile-delivered health management approach can&#xD;
      be more effective than a traditional paper-based health management plan in reducing the&#xD;
      incidence of subsequent preterm births amongst individuals who have already had at least one&#xD;
      preterm birth.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Individuals with a mobile phone capable of downloading apps from the Apple App Store&#xD;
             or Google Play.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participants must consent to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Women whose child is in the neonatal intensive care unit/nursery because the infant&#xD;
             was born preterm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Women 16-50 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Women who can read, write and understand English&#xD;
&#xD;
        Site-specific additional recruitment criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh: Mothers whose babies have been in the neonatal&#xD;
             intensive care unit for more than one month.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. UPMC Magee-Womens Hospital: Mothers who have had a preterm baby of &lt;36 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. For this initial study, those who do not have a mobile phone will be excluded. (This&#xD;
             exclusion will not affect the inclusion of minorities as minorities Internet use via&#xD;
             mobile platforms is equal to or greater than whites; hence we are not excluding&#xD;
             minorities, based on the PEW Research Center study (PEW Internet Spring Tracking&#xD;
             Survey, April 17-May 19, 2013)).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Women who have not previously had a preterm birth will be excluded as we are trying to&#xD;
             reduce the risk of recurrent preterm birth.&#xD;
