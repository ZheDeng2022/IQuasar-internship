  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this research is to study the role of hip flexor strength in the act of particular&#xD;
      movement tasks generally required in cricket. In young cricket players, hip flexor training&#xD;
      protocol may be productive in improving the acceleration time of sprint and shuttle run.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was a Randomized Controlled Trial conducted in National Cricket Academy Lahore, Lahore&#xD;
      zonal Cricket Academy, Multan High Performance Cricket Centre during 6 months. 30&#xD;
      participants were selected through Non Probability Convenience Sampling Technique with&#xD;
      inclusion criteria Female cricket players involved in their training programs aged 17-25&#xD;
      years and Participants should be bodily active before the start of trial for minimum 30&#xD;
      minutes a day for 5 days of week. The participants were excluded if Systematic strength&#xD;
      training Performed by the athletes for the hip flexors more than a week before the start of&#xD;
      trial and if Athlete suffered an injury or having pain in low back area, hips or lower limbs&#xD;
      in last 6 months or if they have any diagnosed Neuro-musculoskeletal, musculo-skeletal&#xD;
      pathology. The Data Collection Tools were 40-yd Dash Test, Shuttle Run and Dynamometer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cricket has undergone dramatic changes in recent years, with the development of one day and&#xD;
      Twenty-twenty cricket altering some of the vital characteristics of the game. The shorter&#xD;
      game formats tend to be more physically intensive when related to match duration,&#xD;
      incorporating more maximal sprints when fielding, bowling, and batting. As a result of these&#xD;
      demands, running speed has become an essential athletic quality for cricketers and therefore&#xD;
      must be assessed correctly. Based on the action of the legs, a running cycle can be&#xD;
      subdivided into 3 phases-a supporting phase that begins when the foot lands and ends when the&#xD;
      athlete's center of gravity (CG) passes forward of it, a driving phase that begins as the&#xD;
      supporting phase ends and ends as the foot leaves the ground, and a recovery phase during&#xD;
      which the foot is off the ground and is being brought forward preparatory to the next&#xD;
      landing. Although quadriceps, hamstrings, and calf muscles are mainly responsible for&#xD;
      propelling the body forward during running and jumping exercises, hip flexor muscles also&#xD;
      contribute to these actions. Specifically, the hip flexor muscles assist in bringing the free&#xD;
      leg forward and upward during the recovery phase of running. Muscular strength is one of the&#xD;
      components of physical fitness. Athletes of different sports use resistance training to&#xD;
      improve their muscular strength. Among the exercises that are commonly performed by athletes,&#xD;
      hip flexion is one of the most ignored exercises in strength and conditioning for sports&#xD;
      performance. Hip flexion exercises are often neglected in strength training programs for&#xD;
      popular sports such as football, basketball, and soccer. Young et al. in 2011 study of the&#xD;
      effects of strength training and reported that 2 sessions per week over a soccer season&#xD;
      produced significant gains in isokinetic hip flexor and extensor strength as well as knee&#xD;
      extensor and flexor strength. This was accompanied by a significant increase in maximum&#xD;
      kicking distance, which was not observed in non-strength trained players. F. Tyler et al&#xD;
      reported that the hip strength and flexibility play role in the incidence of adductor and hip&#xD;
      flexor strains in ice hockey players. Deane et al. in an RCT compares two types of training&#xD;
      programs, it was observed that high resistance training resulted in an improved initial&#xD;
      acceleration phase, whereas high-velocity training resulted in an improved initial&#xD;
      acceleration and maximum speed. Almost all methods or interventions focus on muscles&#xD;
      associated with the driving phase of running (i.e., gluteus maximus, 2 quadriceps, and&#xD;
      plantar flexors), whereas the training of muscles responsible for the recovery phase has not&#xD;
      been explored. Specific ways of strengthening the hip-flexors in injury prevention or&#xD;
      post-surgical rehabilitation have not previously been well described in the sports medicine&#xD;
      literature. Acute injuries to the rectus femoris are often experienced in kicking sports,&#xD;
      such as in the different football codes, whereas longstanding iliopsoas-related pain is&#xD;
      common in football players, runners and dancers. Simple ways of improving hip flexor strength&#xD;
      and function are needed in injury prevention. In addition to exercise machines and&#xD;
      free-weight exercises, resistance training using elastic tubing has been demonstrated to be&#xD;
      effective in strength development and improving sports performance. The clinical advantage of&#xD;
      the elastic band is that it is portable and inexpensive, takes up very little space and can&#xD;
      be used everywhere, indoor as well as outdoor, wherever solid attachment of the elastic band&#xD;
      is possible. Hip flexor injuries are common in cricket players.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Literature is available on hip flexor training on soccer and ice hockey and mostly studies&#xD;
      are done on the dominant sided leg. This study will be an initial attempt in Pakistan to&#xD;
      explore the role of hip flexor strength in the performance of selected movement tasks&#xD;
      commonly required in cricket.&#xD;
