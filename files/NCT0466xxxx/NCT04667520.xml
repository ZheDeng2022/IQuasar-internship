    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this project is to test the efficacy of a technology-supported lifestyle&#xD;
      physical activity (LPA) intervention for preventing relapse among women with depression&#xD;
      engaged in alcohol treatment. Participants are randomized to either 1) LPA+Fitbit&#xD;
      intervention or 2) Fitbit Only control condition. Follow-up assessments and EMA data will be&#xD;
      collected.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a significant and costly public health problem that affects&#xD;
      one-third of the U.S. population in their lifetime. Women develop AUD more quickly and suffer&#xD;
      a broader range of adverse alcohol-related health consequences than men. Physical activity&#xD;
      (PA) interventions may play an important role as an alternate coping strategy for women with&#xD;
      AUD and a means to decrease relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this project is to test the efficacy of a technology-supported lifestyle&#xD;
      physical activity (LPA) intervention for preventing relapse among women with depression&#xD;
      engaged in alcohol treatment. A total of 214 women from the Alcohol and Drug Partial&#xD;
      Hospitalization Program (ADP) at Butler Hospital with AUD and depression will be recruited&#xD;
      and randomly assign them to either a: 1) LPA+Fitbit intervention or 2) Fitbit Only control&#xD;
      condition. Follow-up assessments will occur at 6-weeks, end of treatment (EOT) at 3 months,&#xD;
      and 6, 9 and 12 months. Participants will also complete 3, 10-day periods of ecological&#xD;
      momentary assessment (EMA) during early recovery, at approximately weeks 1 &amp; 2, 5 &amp; 6, and&#xD;
      again at weeks 11 &amp; 12.&#xD;
