    <textblock>
      The research was carried out in randomized controlled experimental type in order to determine&#xD;
      the effect of light in ICU on patients' sleep quality and physiological parameters. The cases&#xD;
      were assigned to the experimental and control groups according to the simple randomization&#xD;
      method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research universe; Between May 2019 and December 2019, sick individuals who were admitted&#xD;
      to the 5 isolation rooms in the Reanimation Intensive Care clinic in the education and&#xD;
      research hospital in Istanbul were formed. The research sample is; As a result of the power&#xD;
      made for the study to be experimentally designed; a total of 148, with a minimum of 74 for&#xD;
      each group. In collecting data; Patient Information Form, Numerical Pain Rating Scale,&#xD;
      Richards Campbell Sleep Scale, Glaskow Coma Scale, Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale, Bedside&#xD;
      Monitors were used to measure physiological parameters. The data obtained as a result of the&#xD;
      research were made using the package program named SPSS (IBM SPSS Statistics 24).&#xD;

      Sleep causes temporary, partial and periodic interruption of the organism's interaction with&#xD;
      the environment, is a physiological condition that affects many systems. That sleep activity&#xD;
      is a vital and important activity for individuals.They emphasized and sleep; the alternating&#xD;
      state of inertia and inertia, around the human a situation where they do not respond to the&#xD;
      events that took place. initiation and maintenance through the function of many cortical and&#xD;
      subcortical brain regions. People sleep on average one third of their lives They spend it.&#xD;
      The sleep of a normal adult person consists of night sleep and It lasts an average of 7 to 9&#xD;
      hours, with a sleep time of four to six 90 to 100 minutes. Non-REM (NREM) and REM sleep&#xD;
      change cyclically. In the sleep-wake cycle in man, the most basic and determinant is the&#xD;
      circadian rhythm. Circadian The rhythm refers to changes in the physiological and biological&#xD;
      processes of the organism for about a day. The main center that regulates the circadian&#xD;
      rhythm is located in the anterior hypothalamus as a double structure. suprachiasmatic nucleus&#xD;
      (SKN). Light is the most important rhythm editor. Other regulators are social and are&#xD;
      physical activities. Florence Nightingale and Virgina Henderson in love and day rhythm;&#xD;
      defined the patient as two important factors in supporting the health of the individual. In&#xD;
      the regulation of the circadian rhythm, the light and dark cycle in the external environment&#xD;
      is important. The synthesis and release of melatonin is stimulated in the dark at night, and&#xD;
      during the day by the effect of light It is suppressed. N-acetyl transferase (NAT) enzyme is&#xD;
      effective in melatonin formation. Melatonin The main task of the hormone is to protect the&#xD;
      biological rhythm of the body. In this context; lighting, circadian rhythm and sleep are&#xD;
      related.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health care institutions and especially intensive care units, in terms of physical&#xD;
      environment and lighting the patient can affect the circadian rhythm of the individual,&#xD;
      change the release of melatonin and as a result can affect sleep patterns and cognitive&#xD;
      performance. In our country, in terms of physical environment lighting, it does not support&#xD;
      circadian rhythms. As a result, sick individuals in the ICU are asleep The therapeutic effect&#xD;
      of sleep because they spend a significant amount of time they need to be awake can not&#xD;
      benefit sufficiently. In addition, in the ICU, many There is a factor. These factors are;&#xD;
      pain, physical condition, drug therapy, fear of death, environmental noise, pleasant&#xD;
      non-smells, invasive interventions, loss of privacy and family disability. In the study of,&#xD;
      the greatest stress of the sick individuals in the ICU One of the causes was found to be&#xD;
      sleeping problems. In the literature, especially in health care institutions In patients with&#xD;
      ICU inpatient, sleep activity has a negative effect on both duration and quality. shows that&#xD;
      it is affected In admission to the ICU, when environmental factors are not suitable, the&#xD;
      patient especially the sleep activity of the individual is impaired and this process occurs&#xD;
      even after the patient is discharged from YBU, can continue. One of the biggest reasons for&#xD;
      this; Physical environment and lighting of ICUs in terms of disruption of circadian rhythms&#xD;
      of sick individuals. The presence of night light suppresses the level of melatonin, which is&#xD;
      normally the highest at night. Melatonin level is accepted as an indicator of circadian&#xD;
      rhythm. Artificial lighting is a known factor in the disruption of the circadian rhythm. Sick&#xD;
      individuals in the ICU, 24 hours it is exposed to artificial light throughout a cycle.&#xD;
      Artificial lighting, health of the sick individual health care to help professionals continue&#xD;
      their care and treatment practices It is applied at high levels for 24 hours in institutions&#xD;
      such as ICU. Its as a result, daylight is often obscured / eliminated in ICUs and artificial&#xD;
      lighting are added. Researches conducted, unnatural night disruption of circadian rhythms&#xD;
      with illumination causes health problems related to sleep activity. It is also sufficient and&#xD;
      relaxing non-sleep, negatively affects the immune system, wound healing process and cognitive&#xD;
      functions of the sick individual. It affects in the same direction, increases the level of&#xD;
      stress and delays its recovery. Sick individuals in the ICU are concerned with serious&#xD;
      illnesses or injuries and care and treatment. The illness of the symptoms lies. Today,&#xD;
      long-term health of an illness or injury in an ICU It is known to cause problems. Some of&#xD;
      these problems are sleep problems due to lighting and circadian rhythm disturbances. our&#xD;
      Country Study to determine the effect of environmental factors related to lighting on sleep&#xD;
      problems in ICU There is. Nurses who continue the care and treatment of sick individuals in&#xD;
      ICU, diagnosing problems early, identifying primary nursing diagnoses, existing stressors&#xD;
      important role such as reduction, ensuring the necessary environmental regulation to create a&#xD;
      therapeutic environment, and they have responsibilities. In this context, this research is&#xD;
      based on YBU. to determine the effect of light on sleep quality and physiological parameters&#xD;
      in individuals and nursing will be carried out to guide its applications.&#xD;
