  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a multicenter Phase IIIb open-label, three-cohort study of asciminib in&#xD;
      patients with CML-CP without T315I mutation who have had at least 2 prior TKIs and CML-CP&#xD;
      harboring the T315I mutation with at least 1 prior TKI&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial consists of three periods: screening and baseline for up to 21 days, active&#xD;
      treatment for up to 72 weeks and a safety follow up period for 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred and fifteen (115) patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase&#xD;
      (CML-CP) without T315I mutation who have had at least 2 prior Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors&#xD;
      (TKIs) and CML-CP with the T315I mutation with at least 1 prior TKI will be considered for&#xD;
      the current study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent will be obtained before any procedures are performed for the study including&#xD;
      eligibility assessments. The results of the real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction&#xD;
      (RQ-PCR) must be available prior to randomization and first dose of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with CML-CP without T315I mutation will be randomly assigned to either cohort A or&#xD;
      B. Patients with the T315I mutation will be enrolled in cohort C. During treatment period&#xD;
      asciminib will be taken orally: Cohort A will be administered 40 mg twice a day, Cohort B&#xD;
      will be administered 80 mg once a day and Cohort C will be administered 200 mg twice a day.&#xD;
      The patients will be treated up to end of study treatment period defined as up to 72 weeks&#xD;
      after the last patient receives the first dose. Patients may be discontinued from treatment&#xD;
      with the study drug at any time due to unacceptable toxicity, disease progression and/or at&#xD;
      the discretion of the investigator or the patient.&#xD;

                  have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate&#xD;
                  clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have&#xD;
                  had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy), total&#xD;
                  hysterectomy or bilateral tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study&#xD;
                  medication. In the case of oophorectomy alone, women are considered&#xD;
                  post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential only when the reproductive&#xD;
                  status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Sexually active males unwilling to use a condom during intercourse while taking study&#xD;
             treatment and for 3 days after stopping study (only for patients treated with&#xD;
             asciminib). A condom is required for all sexually active male participants on&#xD;
             asciminib treatment to prevent them from fathering a child AND to prevent delivery of&#xD;
             study treatment via seminal fluid to their partner. In addition, these male&#xD;
             participants must not donate sperm for the time period specified above.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. If a patient is presenting with symptoms suggestive of possible COVID-19 infection, we&#xD;
             advise ruling it out by appropriate testing recommended by health authorities.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Nucleic acid amplification tests for viral RNA (polymerase chain reaction), in&#xD;
                  order to measure current infection with SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Antigen tests for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Antibody (serology) tests to detect the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
