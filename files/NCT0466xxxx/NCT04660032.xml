  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are stress tests which may identify women at high&#xD;
      risk of future cardiovascular disease (CVD), the leading cause of death among women. Given&#xD;
      the public health impact of HDP and CVD, there is a compelling need to identify scalable&#xD;
      interventions to improve preventative care among women who have risk identified during&#xD;
      pregnancy. We will examine the effects of delivering electronic prompts to obstetric care&#xD;
      providers (nudge) on transitions of care in the postpartum period. We will conduct a pilot&#xD;
      randomized trial to evaluate whether this nudge intervention will improve postpartum&#xD;
      counseling and lead to greater follow-up with preventative care providers among women with&#xD;
      HDP.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women with HDP need ongoing care in the postpartum and inter-pregnancy period. HDP, including&#xD;
      preeclampsia (PEC) and gestational hypertension (GHTN), complicate up to 10% of all&#xD;
      pregnancies and are associated with immediate and long-term cardiovascular morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. HDP increase lifelong risk for chronic hypertension, diabetes, ischemic heart&#xD;
      disease, stroke, and heart failure. Black women have a higher incidence of HDP and have a&#xD;
      disproportionately higher morbidity and mortality compared to non-black women. The American&#xD;
      College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the American Heart Association (AHA)&#xD;
      emphasize the postpartum period as an important opportunity to identify and intervene upon&#xD;
      women at high-risk for future cardiovascular disease (CVD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, current postpartum practices inadequately address transitions of care for women with&#xD;
      HDP. A significant proportion of women with HDP do not see a preventative care provider&#xD;
      (primary care, cardiology) in the months after delivery. Black women are particularly&#xD;
      vulnerable to being lost to follow-up after complicated pregnancy. The HSM program is an&#xD;
      innovative, patient-centered program that monitors postpartum blood pressure remotely using a&#xD;
      text-based interface. It is supported by the Way to Health platform. HSM improves blood&#xD;
      pressure management in the two weeks after delivery and eliminates racial disparities in&#xD;
      blood pressure ascertainment during that time. However, enrollment in HSM did not improve&#xD;
      follow-up in the year after delivery, with less than 1/3 of women having a preventative care&#xD;
      visit. Poor follow-up is likely multifactorial, but may be driven by inadequate patient&#xD;
      counseling in the postpartum period. Among women enrolled in HSM, only 21% of women were&#xD;
      counseled on follow-up with primary care and only 4% were counseled on CVD risk at their&#xD;
      postpartum visits based on chart review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nudges are effective for changing medical decision-making and improving clinical outcomes.&#xD;
      Nudges utilize concepts from behavioral economics to subtly change the decision-making&#xD;
      environment to facilitate evidence-based care and can be delivered to patients, providers, or&#xD;
      both. Examples of nudges include electronic prompts to order cancer screening and electronic&#xD;
      defaults that guide ordering practices. Nudges are low cost, scalable using Electronic&#xD;
      Medical Record (EMR) systems, and improve rates of preventative services including influenza&#xD;
      vaccination, referral to mammography, and statin prescription for CVD prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will use a randomized, controlled superiority trial to evaluate a hospital-wide&#xD;
      initiative to improve counseling for postpartum women who experienced HDP during their&#xD;
      pregnancy or in the immediate postpartum period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The investigators hypothesize that the prompt will increase the proportion of women&#xD;
           counseled on transitioning care to a primary care provider or cardiologist after&#xD;
           pregnancy (primary outcome).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The investigators hypothesize that the provider nudge will increase the proportion of&#xD;
           women attending a preventative care visit within 6 months of delivery as assessed by&#xD;
           chart review and patient surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HSM daily log generated through the Way to Health platform will be used to generate lists&#xD;
      of patients who are eligible for the study. For each eligible woman, the date of and&#xD;
      obstetric care provider for her postpartum visit will be recorded within 3 weeks of delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will then be randomly assigned to a control group with no intervention (usual care&#xD;
      through HSM) or the intervention group (physician nudge) using simple 1:1 randomization&#xD;
      through the Way to Health Platform. If a woman is randomized to the intervention arm, her&#xD;
      obstetric care provider for her postpartum visit will receive a staff message in Epic (Penn&#xD;
      Chart) that the provider's patient has an upcoming postpartum visit. The message will be sent&#xD;
      1 week before the scheduled visit. The message will have patient-specific information&#xD;
      including hypertensive diagnosis, blood pressure medication(s), gestational diabetes&#xD;
      diagnosis, and primary care provider as listed in the Epic banner. The message will also have&#xD;
      dot phrases for recommended counseling and contact information for University of Pennsylvania&#xD;
      Health System (UPHS) primary care and cardiology providers. There will be a dot phrase&#xD;
      recommending follow-up with primary care or cardiology; counseling on risk of future CVD; and&#xD;
      recommending aspirin in a future pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A web-based survey will be distributed to all women in the study 6 months after delivery&#xD;
      through the Way to Health platform. The survey will assess attendance at a preventative care&#xD;
      visit, social determinants of health, health status, and insurance status after delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic characteristics, medical and obstetric history, hypertensive disorder, laboratory&#xD;
      test results (platelet count, creatinine, liver function tests, urine protein, total&#xD;
      cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL-C, HDL-C, glucose, hemoglobin A1c), blood pressure&#xD;
      measurements, height, weight, and office visits within 6 months of delivery will be&#xD;
      abstracted from the EMR. Detailed chart abstraction will be performed regarding counseling at&#xD;
      the postpartum visit and additional office visits within 6 months of delivery focusing on 1)&#xD;
      health maintenance 2) hypertension, or 3) cardiovascular risk reduction. Two reviewers will&#xD;
      assess counseling at each visit. The investigators will obtain data on obstetric care&#xD;
      providers including level (resident physician, attending physician, nurse practitioner,&#xD;
      physician assistant, or certified nurse midwife), gender, and years in practice from publicly&#xD;
      available databases or websites online.&#xD;
