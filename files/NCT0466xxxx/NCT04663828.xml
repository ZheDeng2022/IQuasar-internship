    <textblock>
      The study includes a 12-week treatment trial for chronic tinnitus patients using 4 different&#xD;
      types of interventions (hearing aids, sound therapy, structured counseling, cognitive&#xD;
      behavioral therapy) either as a single treatment or a combination of two treatments. There&#xD;
      are several aims of the study: compare 1) single vs. combined treatments, 2) single&#xD;
      treatments vs. other treatments, 3) ear and brain based interventions, 4) analyzing data of&#xD;
      the clinical trial in combination with other recorded data (genetic and proteomic data,&#xD;
      audiology data) to develop in silico models of tinnitus and a decision support system with&#xD;
      the aim to aid in treatment decisions. This randomized controlled trial is harmonized over&#xD;
      five clinical centers in Europe with the aim to include 100 patients per center and is part&#xD;
      of the UNITI-project (UNification of treatments and Interventions for TInnitus patients)&#xD;
      funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 programme (grant agreement number 848261).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted as a randomized controlled trial (RCT), which investigates the&#xD;
      effect of four different tinnitus therapy approaches applied over a time period of 12 weeks&#xD;
      as a single or rather a combinatory treatment in 100 chronic tinnitus patients. The protocol&#xD;
      of the RCT is harmonized over five clinical centers across Europe with each center&#xD;
      responsible for study procedures (regulations with respect to CGP, GDPR etc.) themselves.&#xD;
      Thus, the present protocol is for the Regensburg part of the study. Used therapies are -&#xD;
      hearing aid (HA), sound therapy (ST), structured counseling (SC) and cognitive behavioral&#xD;
      therapy for tinnitus (CBT4T). HA fitting will be conducted with CE-marked hearing aids from&#xD;
      Signia Hearing Aids (Sivantos Pte. Ltd., Singapore, Republic of Singapore/ WSAudiology,&#xD;
      Lynge, Denmark) with respect to patients hearing profile according to a standardized&#xD;
      procedure. ST will be performed via a specifically developed mobile application (according to&#xD;
      the European regulations for medical software (IEC 62304, IEC 82304)). Patients can select&#xD;
      among 64 standardized or individualized (according to their tinnitus characteristics) sounds&#xD;
      presented at a maximum loudness of 85 dB. A standardized SC protocol will be provided via a&#xD;
      mobile application (preferably), URL-links, e-mail or in printed form over a 12-week&#xD;
      treatment period including 12 chapters (one per week). CBT4T will be held on a weekly basis&#xD;
      in groups not bigger than 6 patients á 1.5-2 hours. All interventions will be carried out by&#xD;
      staff with corresponding expertise (e.g., audiologist or psychologists) or specially trained&#xD;
      study assistants by these experts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the start of the study, potential participants will be online pre-screened with&#xD;
      respect to inclusion and exclusion criteria. If the potential candidates are appropriate for&#xD;
      a participation, they will be invited for a first visit on-site for a detailed screening of&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria, and of health-related, tinnitus-specific, audiological&#xD;
      examinations and electrophysiological measurements (auditory brainstem response, auditory&#xD;
      middle latency response). Based on their determined hearing profile the decision will be&#xD;
      made, whether there is an indication for the application of a HA. Accordingly, the sample of&#xD;
      patients will be stratified into two groups: patients with an HA indication and those without&#xD;
      an indication. If such a HA indication does not exist, patients will alternatively receive&#xD;
      ST. Within these two groups (hearing aid indication - yes or no), patients will be randomly&#xD;
      allocated to the intervention arms consisting of single and combinational interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HA (in the group stratified for hearing aids)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ST&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CBT4T&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combinational therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HA + ST (in the group stratified for hearing aids)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HA + SC (in the group stratified for hearing aids)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HA + CBT4T (in the group stratified for hearing aids)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ST + SC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ST + CBT4T&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SC + CBT4T&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening and baseline as well as treatment start can be performed on the same day. In this&#xD;
      case relevant assessments are only performed once. In addition, blood samples can be obtained&#xD;
      during screening, baseline or a separate visit before treatment begin. Blood sampling is&#xD;
      voluntary and does not have influence on participation of the study. After the baseline visit&#xD;
      the respective intervention will start (at latest 4 weeks after the baseline, otherwise&#xD;
      baseline measurements will be repeated) and last for 12 weeks. During an interim assessment&#xD;
      after 6 weeks of treatment participants have to complete health-related and tinnitus-specific&#xD;
      questionnaires again plus additional assessments of adverse events. Interventions will end&#xD;
      after 12 weeks with a repetition of measurements made during baseline and another evaluation&#xD;
      of adverse events. A follow-up measurement is planned 9 months after the first visit&#xD;
      (baseline measurement). Moreover, an additional voluntary follow-up assessment can be done 12&#xD;
      months after the first visit. Each visit will have a duration of approximately 2-3 hours. Our&#xD;
      primary outcome will focus on changes in tinnitus distress measured via the Tinnitus Handicap&#xD;
      Inventory (THI; (Newman et al., 1996)). Participants can choose to cancel their participation&#xD;
      in the study at any point without reasons or any disadvantages except the missing treatment.&#xD;
      Intervention for a single participant can be cancelled in the case of a significant&#xD;
      deterioration of tinnitus symptoms. Slight worsening might be possible but expected to&#xD;
      short-term. In case of worsening, participants receive support by trained medical and&#xD;
      psychological experts. Prior to the start of the study, it will be registered in&#xD;
      clinicaltrials.gov. For detailed information about the study procedure, interventions and&#xD;
      used measurement please see the attached &quot;UNITI - clinical investigation plan&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample A planned sample size of N = 100 patients in Regensburg will be recruited from the&#xD;
      clinic and polyclinic for ear, nose and throat medicine as well as from the clinic and&#xD;
      polyclinic for psychiatry and psychotherapy both part of the University of Regensburg.&#xD;
      Additional recruitment strategies such as marketing via newspaper etc. are planned.&#xD;
