  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Seroma is one of the most common encountered morbidities after inguinal lymph node dissection&#xD;
      (ILND). It can cause not only much nuisance to both patients and doctors but also its&#xD;
      presence can lead to many complications. This study aimed at evaluation of the role and&#xD;
      effect of using fibrin glue on seroma reduction in patients undergoing ILND. Thirty-two&#xD;
      patient have undergone ILND for various causes. The patients were randomized into two groups;&#xD;
      16 ILND in each. In one group, fibrin glue sealant was applied with a dose of 2ml per 100 cm2&#xD;
      surface area then drain placement was performed. Whereas, in the control group, only drain&#xD;
      placement was used. Preoperative, operative and postoperative data were recorded and&#xD;
      analyzed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Seroma is one of the most frequent complications occurring after ILND as it affects nearly&#xD;
      one third of these cases. During the past decades, many actions have been tried in the&#xD;
      perioperative care to decrease the incidence of these complications, as employing well&#xD;
      vascularized bulky flaps to obliterate the dead space and to protect vessels, great saphenous&#xD;
      vein sparing, strict bed rest and fibrin sealant application. Realizing the underlying&#xD;
      pathology for seroma formation is the key point in its prevention. Thirty-nine patients&#xD;
      scheduled to perform Inguinal lymphadenectomy for various causes have been checked for&#xD;
      eligibility to be enrolled in this prospective, randomized study. Thirty-two patients have&#xD;
      met the inclusion criteria. Inguinal lymphadenectomy has been performed including scarifying&#xD;
      saphenous vein. Sartorius muscle transposition flap was routinely performed for protection of&#xD;
      femoral vessels, then an 18 French conventional non-suction tube drain was inserted in all&#xD;
      patients. All the previous steps were similar in both groups. At this stage, the wound was&#xD;
      closed for the control group, while fibrin glue was prepared to be applied to the fibrin glue&#xD;
      group in a dose of 2mL for 100 cm2 surface area. Postoperatively, the daily collected drain&#xD;
      fluid was measured till the drain was removed when the daily drainage was less than 30 ml.&#xD;
      Then the patients were planned to be followed up postoperatively for at least 4 weeks, to&#xD;
      detect the possible clinically encountered complications as seroma, wound infection, or skin&#xD;
      flap necrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' demographic data and preexisting co-morbidities were recorded. Operative and&#xD;
      pathological data regarding defect size, blood transfusion, primary tumor pathology, and&#xD;
      number and status of retrieved lymph nodes were collected. The mean cumulative amount of the&#xD;
      collected serous fluid, length of drain placement, together with occurrence of&#xD;
      post-operative, seroma, infection, or skin flap necrosis were recorded and compared between&#xD;
      the two groups. The length of hospital stay was compared in the groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The normality of distribution of variables was verified by Kolmogorov- Smirnov test.&#xD;
      Chi-square test (Fisher or Monte Carlo) was used for comparisons between groups for&#xD;
      categorical variables. Student t-test was used to compare two groups for normally distributed&#xD;
      quantitative variables. For not normally distributed quantitative variables, Mann Whitney&#xD;
      test was used to compare between two groups. P value was set to be significant if &lt;0.05.&#xD;
