  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Public safety personnel (PSP) have regular and often intense exposure to potentially&#xD;
      traumatic events at work and are at higher risk for developing mental health problems such as&#xD;
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Studies have shown up to 4 times higher suicidal&#xD;
      ideation, attempt and death among this population compared to the general population. Despite&#xD;
      the high rate of mental health problems among PSPs, their willingness to receive mental&#xD;
      healthcare support is fairly low, mainly due to the stigma attached to these disorders. Those&#xD;
      who are willing to seek help face unique barriers including their irregular shift hours,&#xD;
      limiting their access to resources otherwise available to the public. Given these challenges&#xD;
      and the critical contribution of PSPs to public safety, developing innovative solutions to&#xD;
      address their mental health must be a healthcare priority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposal aims to study the efficacy of using an innovative approach in delivering mental&#xD;
      health online, to address mental health problems among correctional workers (CW), who are&#xD;
      especially prone to mental health problems given the high rate of workplace violence. It is&#xD;
      hypothesized that using an online platform to deliver cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT),&#xD;
      would lower the stigma of receiving care in a secure and confidential environment, easing&#xD;
      CW's concerns about stigma from co-workers. The content is delivered through interactive and&#xD;
      engaging therapy modules, designed for specific groups of CWs and customized by situational&#xD;
      examples to make therapy more relatable. These online modules would provide CWs with 24/7&#xD;
      access to therapy content, solving the irregular work hour problem. The online CBT modules&#xD;
      developed in this study would provide high quality and clinically validated resources to&#xD;
      address mental health problems of CWs all across Canada. Knowledge acquired through this&#xD;
      project could also be beneficial to using iCBT in general for addressing mental health&#xD;
      challenges among other PSPs.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Phase 1 An expert end-user group of correctional workers (n = 5) will help the research team&#xD;
      across all phases of this project. These experts will have in-depth knowledge of CW problems&#xD;
      and will be chosen in consultation with CW union members. Provincial correctional workers (n&#xD;
      = 40) (20 male &amp; 20 female) will be recruited to participate in individual interviews and&#xD;
      then in virtual focus groups through Microsoft Teams. These interviews will be used to&#xD;
      identify the main mental health challenges and the best methods to address them in the&#xD;
      context of different groups of CWs (administrative, operational workers, direct vs indirect&#xD;
      contact with prisoners, working in a prison vs working in probation offices, etc.) and&#xD;
      investigate the barriers specific to each group. Interview/focus group members will be&#xD;
      recruited through flyers (distributed in place of work), advertisements in specialized&#xD;
      journals, through union representatives and through word of mouth. Each individual will be&#xD;
      independently interviewed by a trained research assistant (RA) hired for the project&#xD;
      (60-90-minute interviews). Interviews will occur remotely via a secure video conference with&#xD;
      Microsoft Teams. Questions will include topics of the level of interaction with prisoners,&#xD;
      types and frequency of violence at work, sexual assault, work condition (staffing, shift&#xD;
      length, relationship with superiors and co-workers, work-load, over-crowdedness),&#xD;
      socio-economic factors (racial, gender, language, sexuality, religious discrimination),&#xD;
      mental challenges (anxiety, depression, PTSD, suicidal ideation), resources (training,&#xD;
      peer-support and professional help) and frequency they use them, reasons for refraining to&#xD;
      use resources, the preferred method of support (onsite vs offsite, individual vs. group), and&#xD;
      attitude towards online care (willing to do so and what content they want to be covered).&#xD;
      Information gathered through individual interviews will form the basis for further virtual&#xD;
      focus group discussions with Microsoft Teams. The final format of the questionnaire will be&#xD;
      decided in consultation between the PI and all co-applicants including experts of the field&#xD;
      (Drs. Simpson, Gerritsen and Martin) and the expert end-user group to ensure the validity of&#xD;
      each question from psychiatric, epidemiologic, psychologic, forensic and professional&#xD;
      aspects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following individual interviews, 5 half-day focus groups (8 participants per group, 2&#xD;
      exclusively female, 2 exclusively male, 1 evenly mixed) will be conducted to gather more&#xD;
      information regarding issues uncovered in individual interviews. These focus groups will&#xD;
      occur remotely via a virtual video conference with Microsoft Teams. A list of challenges to&#xD;
      be addressed in phases 2-4 will be formed from these interviews. The PI, one psychiatrist,&#xD;
      one psychologist, one RA and at least 2 members of the end-user expert group will attend each&#xD;
      group meeting to form a better understanding of the problems faced by each group. All&#xD;
      interviews and focus group discussions will be recorded and transcribed verbatim for further&#xD;
      discussion at the investigative team meetings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 Following the first round of content development, each CBT module will be presented&#xD;
      to the end-user expert group and a smaller number of interview/focus group participants (10&#xD;
      males &amp; 10 females) for feedback. Each participant will be asked to provide feedback on one&#xD;
      of the six therapeutic modules regarding content, form, presentation, examples and&#xD;
      helpfulness, based on the challenges it tries to address. All feedback will be summarized and&#xD;
      compiled by project RAs and discussed in 6 separate focus group discussions attended by the&#xD;
      PI, one psychiatrist, one psychologist, one RA and at least 2 members of the end-user expert&#xD;
      group. Each participant is requested to attend two virtual focus group discussions on the&#xD;
      module they have not seen yet or commented on. This step is done to ensure each participant&#xD;
      can provide feedback on all gender-specific therapy contents A list of recommended changes to&#xD;
      each module is developed through these group discussions. Recommendations will be reviewed by&#xD;
      the PI, co-applicants and the knowledge users for clinical validation. The final changes,&#xD;
      compiled by clinicians, will be applied to each module and proper graphical changes will be&#xD;
      made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3 CW participants will be recruited for this phase of the study through flyers&#xD;
      (distributed in place of work), advertisements in specialized journals, through union&#xD;
      representatives and through word of mouth. Also, in this phase, the investigators will accept&#xD;
      participants based on referrals from family physicians or psychiatrists in small cities with&#xD;
      correctional facilities who could be easily informed of the study through academic recourses.&#xD;
      All CWs will go through a comprehensive initial mental health assessment by a psychiatrist&#xD;
      either in person or through video, using Ontario Telemedicine Network (OTN). All diagnoses&#xD;
      are validated by a structured Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) performed&#xD;
      by a trained RA. To be included for the study, the CW should be between 18-55 years of age at&#xD;
      the start of the study, diagnosed with either major depressive disorder (MDD), generalized&#xD;
      anxiety disorder (GAD), or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) according to the Diagnostic&#xD;
      and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5) by a psychiatrist on the&#xD;
      team, competence to provide informed consent and participate, able to speak and read English,&#xD;
      and consistent and reliable access to the internet. The CWs are excluded from the study if&#xD;
      they are diagnosed with hypomanic/manic episodes, psychosis, severe alcohol or substance use&#xD;
      disorder, and active suicidal or homicidal ideation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 100 CWs (50 males, 50 females) meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria will complete a&#xD;
      set of socioeconomic and demographic questionnaires and baseline quantitative clinical&#xD;
      questionnaires delivered online through the Online Psychotherapy Tool (OPTT) (DASS42,&#xD;
      Q-LES-Q, QIDS-SR16, PHQ-9, GAD7, PCL-5). OPTT is a secure, cloud-based, online platform.&#xD;
      After the initial assessment, the CWs will be randomly assigned to one of two study arms; 50&#xD;
      CWs receiving iCBT + TAU (treatment) vs 50 CWs receiving TAU (control).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CWs in the iCBT group will be assigned to one of the six therapy modules, based on their&#xD;
      gender and diagnosis (i.e. Female/Male * GAD, MDD or PTSD). Each CW will be assigned a&#xD;
      specific clinician (a trained psychiatrist/psychologist/ social worker) who would be their&#xD;
      care liaison through the study. Each week, the clinician would send one session of the&#xD;
      12-session curriculum to the CW on a pre-determined day of the week. Each weekly session&#xD;
      consists of 20-30 slides followed by a homework assignment. It usually takes 40-60 minutes&#xD;
      for a participant to complete one weekly session which they have to complete by a specific&#xD;
      day of the week. The clinician will review the CW's assignments and provide feedback on their&#xD;
      performance. The clinician feedback is structured and takes approximately 15 minutes to&#xD;
      complete. The clinician will then send the content for the next session along with the&#xD;
      feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CWs in both study arms will be asked to complete biweekly questionnaires depending on&#xD;
      diagnosis to evaluate any change in diagnostic symptoms. At the end of week 12, the CWs will&#xD;
      be asked to complete a final set of questionnaires (same as baseline) and another MINI. In&#xD;
      order to evaluate long-term effects, follow up evaluations of both study arms will be done at&#xD;
      6 and 12 months following initial enrolment using the same quantitative questionnaires. In&#xD;
      addition to clinical evaluations, CWs receiving iCBT will fill a qualitative questionnaire&#xD;
      regarding their experience using OPTT. These questions will include -whether OPTT was&#xD;
      aesthetically appealing, whether OPTT was intuitive, if they needed technical support,&#xD;
      whether the navigation was simple enough, devices they used to access their therapy. The&#xD;
      results of this feasibility survey will be discussed with the end-user expert group and&#xD;
      system changes will be made for a better experience for the next phase. As data is collected&#xD;
      through the experiment, anonymized data (diagnosis, initial and week 12 assessments,&#xD;
      bi-weekly progress and 6- and 12-month follow-up assessments) will be shared with the other&#xD;
      co-investigators to use in publications or presentations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 4 CWs will be recruited for the study using the same methods as in phase 3, going&#xD;
      through a comprehensive interview by a psychiatrist, and validated by a MINI performed by&#xD;
      trained RAs. Similar inclusion/exclusion criteria as in phase 3 are used for this phase as&#xD;
      well. 100 CWs (gender-balanced) meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria will complete a set of&#xD;
      socio-economic and demographic questionnaires and baseline quantitative clinical&#xD;
      questionnaires delivered online through OPTT. Following the initial assessment, the CWs will&#xD;
      then be randomly assigned to either iCBT + TAU (n=50) or in-person CBT + TAU (n=50).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CWs in either study arm will be will then be assigned to one of the therapy modules, based on&#xD;
      primary diagnosis and gender (Female/Male * GAD, MDD or PTSD). Each CW will be assigned a&#xD;
      specific clinician (trained psychiatrist/psychologist/social worker) who will be their care&#xD;
      liaison through the study. The in-person CBT group will receive similar content, homework,&#xD;
      and feedback as in the iCBT group. All in-person CBT will be delivered by a trained&#xD;
      professional (psychiatrist/psychologist/SW). Each appointment is expected to take 60-75&#xD;
      minutes per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CWs in both study arms will complete biweekly tests depending on diagnosis to evaluate&#xD;
      progress. At the end of the 12 weeks, the CWs will be asked to complete a final set of&#xD;
      quantitative questionnaires and to complete another MINI. Feasibility questionnaires will be&#xD;
      sent to CWs in the iCBT group and the responses will be discussed with the end-user expert&#xD;
      group to form recommendations for improving OPTT. As data is collected through the study,&#xD;
      anonymized data (diagnosis, initial, bi-weekly and 12-week assessments) will be openly shared&#xD;
      for other researchers to use as well.&#xD;
