      Briefly, a trained barbershop navigator will work with each barbershop to measure blood&#xD;
      pressure on each adult customer who agrees, and to provide culturally-targeted education&#xD;
      about high blood pressure and its consequences, and motivational interviewing-informed&#xD;
      counseling about therapeutic lifestyle changes. For customers found to have high blood&#xD;
      pressure, the navigator will also provide referral and navigation to a medical provider and,&#xD;
      as appropriate, a local pharmacy.&#xD;

      This program will be patterned after barbershop-based blood pressure programs that have&#xD;
      demonstrated efficacy in achieving lower blood pressure and improved hypertension control&#xD;
      rates among Black men with high blood pressure. This program will reach 10-12 barbershops per&#xD;
      year, working with 2-3 barbershops each quarter. Briefly, a trained barbershop navigator will&#xD;
      work with each barbershop t o measure blood pressure on each adult customer who agrees, and&#xD;
      to provide culturally-targeted education about high blood pressure and its consequences, and&#xD;
      motivational interviewing-informed counseling about therapeutic lifestyle changes. For&#xD;
      customers found to have high blood pressure, the navigator will also provide referral and&#xD;
      navigation to a medical provider and, as appropriate, a local pharmacy. At all recruitment&#xD;
      events, all study team members and potential participants must wear masks and practice social&#xD;
      distancing when appropriate. Participants who do not have face masks should be offered masks&#xD;
      for continued outreach participation. Study team members will also wear gloves and have hand&#xD;
      sanitizer visible. When available, staff should wash hands frequently with soap and water. If&#xD;
      this option is not available, staff should frequently use hand sanitizer.&#xD;

    <description>The Welch Allyn ABPM 7100 is an easy-to-use 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitor that is designed to help avoid the effects of white coat hypertension, provide accurate sleep blood pressure readings, and tailor drug therapy regimes to your individual patient's needs.&#xD;
This device is programmed to take three BP readings a minute apart. To be eligible, participants must have an average SBP &gt; 135 mm Hg or DBP &gt; 85 mmHg (based on the average of 3 BP readings); or average SBP &gt; 130 mm Hg or DBP &gt; 80 mm hg (for those with diabetes or kidney disease) based on JNC-7 criteria for uncontrolled HTN.</description>

        This study is limited to men. Because the goal of this study is to reduce the racial&#xD;
        disparities in hypertension-related outcomes between minority ethnic/racial groups and&#xD;
        whites, the participants in this study will be self-identified as African American or Black&#xD;
