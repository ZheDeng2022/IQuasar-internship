  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Acetabular fractures result from violent trauma, and their incidence has been&#xD;
      increasing in recent years. The Kocher-Langenbeck surgical approach is used for the internal&#xD;
      fixation of displaced fractures of the posterior structures of the acetabulum. The quality of&#xD;
      the reduction and the stability of osteosynthesis directly influence the function of the&#xD;
      repaired acetabulum. In the surgical management of acetabulum fractures, 3D printing of a&#xD;
      bone model is increasingly used during preoperative planning by trauma surgeons worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questions: Is there a difference in the surgical time of the Kocher-langenbeck reduction and&#xD;
      fixation of the posterior structures of the acetabulum between 3D printing (which allows for&#xD;
      shaping of the reconstruction plate prior to surgery) and the conventional technique? Are&#xD;
      there any differences in complications between the two techniques? Are there any short-term&#xD;
      differences in the functional and radiographic scores between 3D printing and the&#xD;
      conventional technique? Methods: 109 consecutive patients who sustained fractures of the&#xD;
      acetabulum were screened for inclusion. 43 patient were studied. The first group (G1)&#xD;
      consisted of 20 patients who underwent prior molding of the osteosynthesis plate on a&#xD;
      3D-printed model. The second group (G2 or control group) included 23 patients who underwent&#xD;
      surgery using the conventional technique. We compared surgical time, intraoperative blood&#xD;
      loss, the difference between pre- and postoperative hemoglobin, and the onset of early&#xD;
      infection, paralysis of the sciatic nerve, and deep vein thrombosis.&#xD;

      This randomized, prospective study included 109 consecutive patients who were treated for&#xD;
      fractures of the acetabulum between September 2016 and February 2019 at our institution. This&#xD;
      study was approved by the ethics committee at our institution and verbal and written informed&#xD;
      consent was obtained from all patients. The final analysis included 43 patients (33 males and&#xD;
      10 females) who underwent the Kocher-Langenbeck approach for the reduction and fixation of&#xD;
      the posterior structures of the acetabulum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients were divided into two groups. Group 1 (G1) consisted of 20 patients who&#xD;
      underwent preoperative molding of the osteosynthesis plate on a 3D printed model of the&#xD;
      pelvis. Group 2 (G2 or control group) included 23 patients who underwent surgery using the&#xD;
      conventional technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were examined in the outpatient department via clinical and radiographic&#xD;
      evaluation at 3, 6, 12, and 24 weeks postoperatively, then every 6 months thereafter. A&#xD;
      standard radiographic assessment including three views (AP, iliac oblique, and obturator&#xD;
      oblique) and a pelvic CT scan were obtained for all patients at the last follow-up visit. The&#xD;
      reductions were classified as one of three types: anatomical (residual displacement &lt;1 mm),&#xD;
      imperfect (residual displacement 1 to 3 mm), and poor (residual reduction &gt;3 mm). Clinical&#xD;
      outcomes were assessed using the modified Harris Hip score. Bone consolidation was obtained&#xD;
      in all cases. Clinical and radiographic results at the last follow-up as well as the minimum&#xD;
      follow-up duration were evaluated by one surgeon who did not participate in the surgical&#xD;
      management of the patients.&#xD;

    <description>Group 1 (G1) consisted of 20 patients who underwent preoperative molding of the osteosynthesis plate on a 3D printed model of the pelvis. A preoperative scan of the healthy hemi-pelvis was used to create the 3D-printed model for patients in G1 according to the following three-step methodology: 1) A scanographic acquisition of images was performed using a multi-strip scanner in thin sections. These images were recorded as digital images in the standard medical format of digital imaging and communications ; 2) A digital, 3D model of the pelvis in the stereolithography format was created to digitally treat the 2D images. The individualization of the healthy hemi-pelvis, to which a &quot;mirror effect&quot; was applied allowed for the creation of a symmetrical 3D image, as hemi-pelvises are globally symmetrical. 3) A 3D printer was used to create a physical, 3D-printed model of the affected hemi-pelvis using polylactic acid.</description>
