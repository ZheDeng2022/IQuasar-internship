  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to use optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) to&#xD;
      compare retinal vasculature after uncomplicated cataract surgery in patients with and without&#xD;
      diabetic retinopathy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing cataract surgery who provided informed consent were enrolled in the&#xD;
      study. There were three comparison groups: control, diabetic retinopathy (DR) and diabetic&#xD;
      macular edema (DME) groups. Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) scans measuring&#xD;
      retinal thickness, vessel density, perfusion density, and foveal avascular zone were obtained&#xD;
      at baseline and postoperative week one, month one and month three.&#xD;
