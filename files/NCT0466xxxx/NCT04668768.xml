  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to use glucarpidase prophylactically to treat methotrexate induced toxicities&#xD;
      in lymphoma patients with cerebral involvement.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment and prophylaxis against CNS (central nervous system) lymphoma typically consist of&#xD;
      a regimen containing high dose methotrexate (HD MTX), which requires inpatient monitoring in&#xD;
      order to ensure adequate clearance of methotrexate levels (MTX). The goal of this&#xD;
      prospective, multi-institution study is to evaluate the effect of prophylactic glucarpidase&#xD;
      in patients receiving high dose MTX and are at increased risk of delayed MTX clearance and&#xD;
      nephrotoxicity. Glucarpidase is a recombinant bacterial enzyme (carboxypeptidase G2) that can&#xD;
      convert MTX to non-cytotoxic metabolites (DAMPA). This is the first controlled trial&#xD;
      comparing glucarpidase with supportive care alone in patients with MTX induced nephrotoxicity&#xD;
      and delayed MTX clearance.&#xD;
