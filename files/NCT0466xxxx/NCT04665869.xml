  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized with both&#xD;
      clinical motor and non-motor features, as well as decrease in balance performance and walking&#xD;
      endurance. The non-motor symptoms such as depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance and fatigue&#xD;
      wound impose negative impacts on the quality of life of the individuals with PD. Aerobic&#xD;
      endurance training can improve physical capacity and reduce those non-motor symptoms such as&#xD;
      mood and sleep disorders. Based on the results of our recent pilot study, brisk walking is a&#xD;
      safe and moderate-level aerobic walking exercise for improving walking capacity in the PD&#xD;
      population up to 6 week after treatment ended. Community-based balance training could also&#xD;
      enhance balance performance and dual-task gait performance up to 12-month follow-up for&#xD;
      people with PD. The primary purpose of this proposed study is to investigate the short- and&#xD;
      long-term effects of a 6-month balance and brisk walking programme in alleviating non-motor&#xD;
      and motor symptoms in people with PD. The secondary objective is to examine the short- and&#xD;
      long-term effects of a 6-month balance and brisk walking program on enhancing walking&#xD;
      capacity, balance performance, and quality of life.&#xD;

    <description>The Non-Motor Symptoms Scale is a 30-item rater-based scale to assess a wide range of non-motor symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). The NMSS measures the severity and frequency of non-motor symptoms across nine dimensions. The NMSS total score ranges form 0 to 360, with a higher score indicates worse PD non-motor symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Parkinson Disease Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39) summary index score</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>It is a health-related quality-of-life outcome measure that contains 39 self-reported items on eight domains, i.e.: mobility [#1-10], activities of daily living [#11-16], emotional well-being [#17-22], stigma [#23-26], social support [#27-29], cognition [#30-33], communication [#34-36], and body discomfort [#37-39]. The PDQ-39 has been translated into Chinese and validated for local use. Each item is scored on 5-point Likert-type scales ranging from 0 (never), 1 (occasionally), 2 (sometimes), and 3 (often) to 4 (always) based on their perception on the item over the past month. The PDQ-39 total score is 156 and the PDQ-39 summary index is created by summing all eight of the PDQ-39 domains and standardizing the score on a scale of 0-100%. A lower PDQ-39 summary index score reflects a better health-related quality-of-life.</description>

    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index is an effective instrument used to measure the quality and patterns of sleep in adults. It differentiates &quot;poor&quot; from &quot;good&quot; sleep quality by measuring seven areas (components): subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medications, and daytime dysfunction over the last month. A total score of &quot;5&quot; or greater is indicative of poor sleep quality.</description>
