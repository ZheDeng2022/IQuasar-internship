  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Every year, thousands of Canadians receive life-saving, cost-effective organ transplants,&#xD;
      while thousands more still wait or die because not enough organs are available. Patients with&#xD;
      non-recoverable illnesses, who are undergoing withdrawal of life sustaining measures, can&#xD;
      donate their organs when they die by a process called donation after circulatory determined&#xD;
      death (DCD). However, over 30% of all DCD attempts are unsuccessful because patients do not&#xD;
      die within the time frame required for healthy organ retrieval and prolonged exposure to low&#xD;
      oxygen during the dying process renders organs unsuitable for transplantation. Predicting&#xD;
      successful DCD is difficult and leads to uncertainty in the clinical community. To address&#xD;
      this issue, the investigators have developed a clinical decision support tool called Donation&#xD;
      Advisor (DA) that will assist the healthcare team in identifying successful DCD donors and&#xD;
      will provide an improved assessment of the health of their organs. The investigators are&#xD;
      ready to implement DA and evaluate its impact in 7 hospitals in Ontario. The investigators&#xD;
      believe use of DA will reduce unsuccessful DCD attempts, enhance family experience of&#xD;
      donation, optimize system costs, and improve transplant outcomes&#xD;

    <description>Heart rate, systolic, mean and diastolic blood pressure and oxymetry will be downloaded from the bedside monitor. Automated algorithms will assess the quality of the waveform data, and detect the necessary fiducial markers (R peaks, systolic and diastolic peaks, and pulse pressure measurements), and perform cleaning of artifacts, missing data and noise, to form vital signs time series, which will be used to calculate variability metrics for the patient.</description>

    <description>Data with be collected using 'Thinking aloud interviews' where Health Care Professional with review DA Reports. Data captured: misunderstandings, pauses, repetitions, and expressions of frustration or confusion. These &quot;usability problems&quot; will become target areas for improvements on subsequent versions of the tool. A series of direct questions will allow the interviewee to report on overall usability (clarity, ease of navigation) and usefulness of the tool. They will be asked about the feasibility and usefulness of using a tool like this in their clinical practice, as well as the amount of time one could reasonably expect a physician to spend with a tool like this in their clinical practice, to inform the final design goals for the tool. Finally, interviewees will be asked to report as many potential barriers to and drivers of use of the tool as they can.</description>

    <description>Estimate of required resources and associated costs to further develop and expand implementation of the DA tool - The investigators will assess the economic feasibility of DA tool by calculating the cost of developing and implementing DA tool. A blended micro- and gross- costing approach will be used. The investigators will develop a data collection form to collect resource use for developing, operating, and maintaining the DA tool. Their unit costs will be obtained from program financial records, service level agreements, and the program budget with a close consultation with the project staff</description>
