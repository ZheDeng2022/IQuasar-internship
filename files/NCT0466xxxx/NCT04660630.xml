      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness, safety and health economics of&#xD;
      precise drug use strategies based on pharmacogenomics compared with traditional drug use&#xD;
      strategies for cardiovascular related chronic diseases.&#xD;

      This study is a randomized controlled, single blind, multicenter clinical study. Beijing&#xD;
      Chaoyang Hospital is the team leader, and director Liu Lihong is the project leader. The sub&#xD;
      center is Daming County Street Town Health Center and Daming County Jiuzhi township health&#xD;
      center. The team leader is responsible for the formulation, implementation and coordination&#xD;
      of the research plan, and each sub center is responsible for the implementation of the&#xD;
      specific study, patient management and research information feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three project groups were set up in this study: primary hypertension, type 2 diabetes and&#xD;
      hyperlipidemia. In each group, the control group and the experimental group were set up, and&#xD;
      the patients in two pilot towns of Daming County were selected by cluster stratified random&#xD;
      sampling. The control group received the treatment of local researchers according to the&#xD;
      traditional medication strategy. The patients in the experimental group were treated with the&#xD;
      drug regimen formulated by local researchers according to the results of their&#xD;
      pharmacogenomic test reports. The subjects were single blind.&#xD;
