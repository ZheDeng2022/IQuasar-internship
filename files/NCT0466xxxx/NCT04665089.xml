  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In sepsis and septic shock, the host response is characterized by a complex of&#xD;
      immune-inflammatory reactions; triggered and activated by microbial components. These&#xD;
      reactions are controlled by a balance of pro-inflammatory cytokines and anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines. The imbalance of this immune response is a source of organ dysfunction; major&#xD;
      prognostic factor during septic condition. This pretext has created the need for therapies&#xD;
      aimed to modulate the overstated of host response. During the past 2 decades, macrolide&#xD;
      molecules proved interest to be immunomodulatory agents; due beyond their antibacterial&#xD;
      activity. Their regulatory role in the production of cytokines was demonstrated in the&#xD;
      management of severe acute community pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the adjunction of macrolides to standard therapy in&#xD;
      patients with sepsis or septic shock is associated to a favorable immunomodulatory and&#xD;
      clinical effects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host&#xD;
      response to infection. It is considered as the main cause of death in critically ill patients&#xD;
      ranging from 20 to 50%. These alarming death rates have prompted several intense research&#xD;
      efforts to better understand the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of sepsis. Currently,&#xD;
      sepsis is recognized as a complex entity created by an immuno-inflammatory reaction of the&#xD;
      infected host; triggered and activated by microbial components. This reaction brings together&#xD;
      the cellular and humoral immunity defense systems. Activation of the cellular system involves&#xD;
      macrophages, polymorphonuclear cells, lymphocytes and endothelial cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, pro-inflammatory cytokines are secreted in order to control the infection (IL-1,&#xD;
      IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha). Simultaneously, anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-10) are&#xD;
      also released, allowing a local and systemic regulation of the inflammatory cascade. The&#xD;
      imbalance of this immune response is a source of organ dysfunction aggravated by the lack of&#xD;
      tissue oxygenation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Understanding that sepsis results from a disproportionate immune-inflammatory response have&#xD;
      created the need for therapies aimed to modulate the overstated host response. The agents&#xD;
      tested were: anti-endotoxin antibodies, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), anti-TNF-alpha,&#xD;
      recombinant human activated protein C (rhAPC), stress-dose hydrocortisone and statins. Most&#xD;
      of these clinical trials showed no obvious clinical impact or a limited clinical efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the past 2 decades, macrolides molecules were revealed to be immune-modulator agents;&#xD;
      beyond their antibacterial activity. Their immune-modulator properties result from their&#xD;
      ability to induce the activity of various immune cells and their regulatory role in the&#xD;
      production of cytokines. Several cellular targets and mechanisms have been described to&#xD;
      explain the immune-modulator effects of macrolides: Respiratory epithelial cells and innate&#xD;
      immunity cells. Overall, macrolides decrease the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by&#xD;
      innate and adaptive immunity cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this clinical trial, the investigators are focusing on the effects of macrolides on the&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory / anti-inflammatory balance by assaying cytokines and other&#xD;
      immune-inflammatory markers during sepsis and septic shock. The main hypothesis is that the&#xD;
      use of macrolides in addition to standard therapy in critically septic patients has a&#xD;
      favorable immune-modulator and clinical effects compared to critically septic patients not&#xD;
      receiving macrolide.&#xD;
