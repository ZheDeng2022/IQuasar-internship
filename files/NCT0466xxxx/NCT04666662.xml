  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to develop a prognostic model to predict the risk of relapse within 6-8&#xD;
      months of patients entering remission. The long-term objective is to facilitate more&#xD;
      efficient targeting of evidence-based relapse prevention strategies to these patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most patients with depression are treated in primary care by general practitioners (GPs).&#xD;
      Relapse of depression is common and leads to considerable morbidity and decreased quality of&#xD;
      life for patients. Estimates suggest that at least 50% of patients treated for depression&#xD;
      will relapse after a single episode. The majority of these will relapse within 6 months and&#xD;
      the risk of relapse increases for each successive episode of depression. GPs see a largely&#xD;
      undifferentiated case-mix of patients and, once patients with depression reach remission,&#xD;
      there is limited guidance and no validated tools to help GPs stratify patients according to&#xD;
      risk of relapse.This study will potentially derive a statistical model to predict relapse of&#xD;
      depression in remitted depressed patients in primary care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have created a longitudinal cohort of patients drawn from seven randomised&#xD;
      controlled trials (RCTs) of non-pharmacological primary care-based interventions for&#xD;
      depression and one longitudinal cohort study. The investigators will use logistic regression&#xD;
      to predict the outcome of relapse of depression within 6-8 months. The investigators plan to&#xD;
      include the following well-evidenced relapse predictors in the model: residual depressive&#xD;
      symptoms; number of previous episodes of depression; co-morbid anxiety; and severity of the&#xD;
      index episode. They will also control for RCT intervention received by participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If sample size and availability of predictor information allows, the investigators will&#xD;
      include the following predictors in an exploratory analysis: age; relationship status;&#xD;
      multi-morbidity; employment status; gender; and ethnicity. Generalisability will be assessed&#xD;
      through internal-external cross-validation and net benefit will be explored.&#xD;
