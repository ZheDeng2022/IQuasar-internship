  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the effect of lutetium Lu 177 dotatate compared to the usual&#xD;
      treatment (everolimus) in treating patients with somatostatin receptor positive bronchial&#xD;
      neuroendocrine tumors that have spread to other places in the body (advanced). Radioactive&#xD;
      drugs, such as lutetium Lu 177 dotatate, may carry radiation directly to tumor cells and may&#xD;
      reduce harm to normal cells. Lutetium Lu 177 dotatate may be more effective than everolimus&#xD;
      in shrinking or stabilizing advanced bronchial neuroendocrine tumors.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare progression-free survival (PFS) of receiving lutetium Lu 177 dotatate to that&#xD;
      of receiving everolimus in patients with bronchial neuroendocrine tumor (NET).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the overall survival (OS) of receiving lutetium Lu 177 dotatate versus&#xD;
      everolimus in patients with bronchial NET.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To compare the overall response rate (ORR) associated with lutetium Lu 177 dotatate&#xD;
      versus everolimus in patients with bronchial NET.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate and compare the toxicity profile of lutetium Lu 177 dotatate and everolimus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To study late toxicities of lutetium Lu 177 dotatate therapy including renal dysfunction,&#xD;
      myelodysplastic syndrome, and acute leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To study the impact of pretreatment disease burden, somatostatin receptor status on&#xD;
      lutetium Lu 177 dotatate (DOTATATE) positron emission tomography (PET) (or other somatostatin&#xD;
      receptor [SSTR]-PET), and measured dosimetry of response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the response rate (RR) and other efficacy parameters in typical and atypical&#xD;
      carcinoid based on central retrospective pathology review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive lutetium Lu 177 dotatate intravenously (IV) over 30-40 minutes on day&#xD;
      1. Treatment repeats every 56 days for 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive everolimus orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat&#xD;
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with&#xD;
      disease progression may be able to cross-over to Arm I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months until disease&#xD;
      progression and then every 6 months for up to 5 years following study registration.&#xD;
