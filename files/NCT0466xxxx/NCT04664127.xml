      This study examined the efficacy, safety and benefits of modern treatment and changes in the&#xD;
      dynamics of the life of adult patients quality with severe herpes simplex in the current&#xD;
      medical practice when combined therapy by acyclic nucleoside Valacyclovir and antiviral agent&#xD;
      Kagocel versus monotherapy by Valacyclovir. This study also evaluated the structure of&#xD;
      herpesvirus infections and the rate of mixed variants of the course, the rate of&#xD;
      exacerbations of herpes simplex, the time of disappearance of human herpesvirus isolation and&#xD;
      the features of the immune phenotype of patients taking different types of therapy.&#xD;
