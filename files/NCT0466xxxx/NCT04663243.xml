      The trial is to evaluate the effect of an evidence-informed, depression focused early&#xD;
      prenatal prevention intervention at six weeks' postpartum. Secondary objective is to explore&#xD;
      demographical and psychosocial factors responsible for development of prenatal and postpartum&#xD;
      depression. Investigator will also examine the potential mediators of depression and the&#xD;
      effect of intervention on depression and its related factors i.e. marital relationship,&#xD;
      social support, empowerment and history of intimate partner violence. Pregnant women coming&#xD;
      for their antenatal visits to the Sheikh Zayed Hospital (SZH), a public facility in Lahore,&#xD;
      Pakistan, will be screened for eligibility. Eligible women will be 24-26 weeks pregnancy who&#xD;
      will be assessed as having mild to moderate levels of depression [i.e., score ≥10 on Personal&#xD;
      Health Care Questionnaire (PHQ-9)] validated in Pakistan for the use of non-specialist.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of evidence informed, depression focused&#xD;
      early prenatal prevention intervention in pregnant women at six weeks' postpartum.&#xD;
      Investigator hypothesize that women with subclinical to clinical levels of prenatal&#xD;
      depression to the intervention will result in fewer cases of depression (mild to moderate) at&#xD;
      six weeks' postpartum. The primary objective of the trial is to evaluate the effect of an&#xD;
      evidence-informed, depression focused early prenatal prevention intervention at six weeks'&#xD;
      postpartum. Secondary objective is to explore demographical and psychosocial factors&#xD;
      responsible for development of prenatal and postpartum depression. We will also examine the&#xD;
      potential mediators of depression and the effect of intervention on depression and its&#xD;
      related factors i.e. marital relationship, social support, empowerment and history of&#xD;
      intimate partner violence. Pregnant women coming for their antenatal visits to the Sheikh&#xD;
      Zayed Hospital (SZH), a public facility in Lahore, Pakistan, will be screened for&#xD;
      eligibility. Eligible women will be 24-26 weeks pregnancy who will be assessed as having mild&#xD;
      to moderate levels of depression [i.e., score ≥10 on Personal Health Care Questionnaire&#xD;
      (PHQ-9)] validated in Pakistan for the use of non-specialist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An intervention thinking Healthy Program (THP) will be done in which Investigator will enroll&#xD;
      up to twenty (20) pregnant women. Low line psychosocial intervention based on the principles&#xD;
      of Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT), designed for non-specialist will be applied for&#xD;
      expectant women experiencing depression during mid to late-pregnancy. It uses the core&#xD;
      principles and strategies of the Thinking Healthy Program (THP), an evidence-based&#xD;
      psychosocial intervention for mothers experiencing perinatal depression, including empathetic&#xD;
      listening, thought challenging, behavior activation, family involvement, and problem&#xD;
      management. Additionally, stress management skills such as breathing exercises are&#xD;
      incorporated. Culturally relevant customized illustrations are used for guided discovery,&#xD;
      behavior activation, stress management, and to convey key health messages. The intervention&#xD;
      is a series of one-on-one sessions, complemented by take home exercises. Before and after&#xD;
      intervention comparison will be made to find out the efficacy of intervention. The data will&#xD;
      be collected at one site: Sheikh Zayed Hospital, a public tertiary care facility in Lahore,&#xD;
      Pakistan. It will take six months for data collection.&#xD;
