  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Twenty-four adult patients (male and female) with generalized gingivitis participated in the&#xD;
      double-blinded randomized crossover trial was divided into two groups, (aloe vera and Colgate&#xD;
      toothpaste). a week after receiving polishing and scaling,24hours plaque re-growth, one group&#xD;
      received Aloe Vera toothpaste twice times daily and the second group received Colgate&#xD;
      toothpaste twice daily. The first visit included PLI measurement after that Investigator&#xD;
      removed the supra gingival plaque by cotton roll to avoid contamination with the PERIOPAPER&#xD;
      strip during GCF collection, then GCF collected from targeted sites(upper incisors, labial&#xD;
      side)and Unstimulated saliva collected (for early colonizer bacterial load S. sanguinis and&#xD;
      S. mutant) after that the other clinical periodontal parameters ( BOP) were measured and then&#xD;
      scaling was done after sample collection because of gingival bleeding which occur during&#xD;
      scaling then inform the patient to use the coded toothpaste which gave to the participant by&#xD;
      the assistant not involve in the study so the researcher did not know the type of toothpaste&#xD;
      that was given to the participant (Colgate or aloe vera twice daily).The toothpastes was&#xD;
      given for one week .The codded toothpaste was gave randomly by a decision on that day for&#xD;
      example on Sunday Investigator gave all the participants code 1 and on other days&#xD;
      Investigator gave to other participants code 2 .In the second visit the PLI was measured&#xD;
      first , then the samples were collected from the same teeth after that the other periodontal&#xD;
      parameters were collected again ( BOP). After that, participants entered a 6-day wash out&#xD;
      period and they were asked to resume oral hygiene measures. After the washout period, the&#xD;
      same protocol was repeated for other type of toothpaste.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the most predominant periodontal diseases is the plaque induced gingivitis. Certain&#xD;
      plants used in folk medicine serve as a source of therapeutic agents that have antimicrobial&#xD;
      and other multipotential effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: The aim of study is to evaluate the toothpaste containing high concentration of Aloe&#xD;
      Vera on reduction of plaque and gingivitis and on clinical periodontal parameter (PI&amp;BOP)&#xD;
      salivary primary colonizers boat (S. sanguinis and S. mutant).and determine the effect of&#xD;
      aloe vera toothpaste on the pro inflammatory cytokines (IL_1β) in the gingival crevicular&#xD;
      fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective To evaluate the efficacy of aloe vera toothpaste on IL_1β by using ELISA technique&#xD;
      and evaluate the efficacy of aloe vera toothpaste on early colonizer load using (PCR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null hypothesis aloe vera has Anti-Inflammatory effect by reducing IL_1β and some clinical&#xD;
      periodontal parameters (plaque index&amp; bleeding on probing index) when used by the patients&#xD;
      with regular mechanical oral hygiene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternative hypothesis the effect of aloe vera toothpaste is less than Colgate toothpaste on&#xD;
      the inflammatory marker IL_1β, early load and some clinical parameters (PI and BOP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods Twenty-four adult patients (male and female) with generalized&#xD;
      gingivitis participated in the double-blinded randomized crossover trial was divided into two&#xD;
      groups, (aloe vera and Colgate toothpaste). A week after receiving polishing and&#xD;
      scaling,24hours plaque re-growth. In zero day, after 24h and 7 days' time points, plaque&#xD;
      index and bleeding on probe was recorded, and then the participants entered a 7-day washout&#xD;
      period with regular oral hygiene measures. And 7days to used other type of toothpaste (aloe&#xD;
      vera or Colgate).in the first visit (zero day) GCF collected from targeted sites (upper&#xD;
      incisors, labial side). In the second visit (after 24 hours) saliva collected (for early&#xD;
      colonizer load) and the patient brushing teeth and wait 2 hours, after 2hour saliva collected&#xD;
      again. the GCF collected in third visit (after7 days), fourth visit (after wash out period)&#xD;
      and fifth visit from the same teeth. Saliva collected in third and fifth visit.&#xD;
