  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate how effective lower doses of CPX-351 are in older&#xD;
      participants with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who are not eligible to&#xD;
      receive intensive chemotherapy and in participants with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) after&#xD;
      Hypomethylating Agents (HMA) failure.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, elderly patients with AML and high risk MDS, who are ineligible to receive&#xD;
      induction chemotherapy and fail HMA +/- combination, have very poor outcomes and there is no&#xD;
      FDA-approved therapy outside of some targeted therapies which can only be applied to a small&#xD;
      patient population. CPX-351 is an investigational (experimental) drug that works by combining&#xD;
      two anti-cancer drugs cytarabine and daunorubicin. CPX-351 is experimental because it is only&#xD;
      FDA approved for the treatment of adults with two types of AML: newly diagnosed&#xD;
      therapy-related AML or AML with myelodysplasia-related changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open label clinical trial of lower doses of CPX-351 in relapsed/primary refractory&#xD;
      older AML and MDS patients ineligible to receive intensive chemotherapy. The first arm is for&#xD;
      particpants with primary refractory/relapsed AML and the second arm is for higher risk MDS&#xD;
      participants after HMA failure.&#xD;
