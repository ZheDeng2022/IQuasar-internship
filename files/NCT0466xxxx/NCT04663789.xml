  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative fistula is the major complications of distal pancreatectomies which prohibit&#xD;
      patients' recovery. Previous studies have reported controversial results regarding the&#xD;
      efficacy of pancreatic stump reinforcement methods. Prior research has commonly included&#xD;
      minimally invasive and open cases together. Moreover, stapler and suture were combined in&#xD;
      most studies making interpretation difficult. Data has shown that staple line plus&#xD;
      reinforcement might potentially decrease the CR-POPF rate of patients who underwent distal&#xD;
      pancreatectomies, but well-designed high-quality evidence is lacking. Thus, the investigators&#xD;
      design the present study to the question that whether routine staple line plus reinforcement&#xD;
      would bring benefit for participants.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Distal pancreatectomy (DP)is the standard surgical method for benign or malignant pancreatic&#xD;
      tumors locating at body and tail [1]. Clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula&#xD;
      (CR-POPF) is the major complication after pancreatectomy. In literature, reported CR-POPF&#xD;
      rate after distal pancreatectomy varied between 5% and 64% from different centers. It's still&#xD;
      a challenge to prevent CR-POPF via effective pancreatic remnant closure and no consensus on&#xD;
      the optimal surgical technique has been established. Reported surgical strategies to prevent&#xD;
      CR-POPF included stapler transection, staple line reinforcement, stump coverage with&#xD;
      autologous tissue or fibrin glue, mesh reinforcement, and prophylactic administration of&#xD;
      octreotide. However, none had convincing outcome [2-4].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data has shown that staple line plus suture reinforcement might potentially decrease the&#xD;
      CR-POPF rate of patients who underwent distal pancreatectomies, but well-designed&#xD;
      high-quality evidence is lacking. Meanwhile, prior researches have commonly included&#xD;
      minimally invasive and open cases together. Moreover, stapler and suture were combined in&#xD;
      most studies making interpretation difficult [5-8].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the investigators design a single-centered, parallel, randomized controlled trial to&#xD;
      compare the efficacy of routine staple line plus reinforcement versus staple only on the&#xD;
      CR-POPF rate of participants who underwent minimally invasive distal pancreatectomies.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The study is a single-center, randomized controlled clinical trial. Grouping: the study group is set as &quot;staple line plus reinforcement&quot; group, in which a lock stitch will be placed after transecting the pancreas with stapler. While the control group is set as &quot;staple line with no reinforcement&quot; group, in which no additional reinforcement is used after transecting the pancreas with stapler.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>CR-POPF is defined according to the revised 2016 version of ISGPS (International Study Group on Pancreatic Surgery) classification and grading of POPF. A CR-POPF is defined as a drain output of any measurable volume of fluid with amylase level greater than 3 times the upper Institutional normal serum amylase level, associated with a clinically relevant development/condition related directly to the POPF.</description>
