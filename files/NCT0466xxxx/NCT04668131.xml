  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is designed as a prospective, randomized, open, controlled clinical trial. For&#xD;
      the first time, acupuncture was applied to the treatment of dry ocular neuropathic pain. Its&#xD;
      mechanism was discussed by comparing the efficacy between acupuncture and artificial tears.&#xD;

    <description>OSDI consists of 12 scoring items, divided into three parts: severity of symptoms, impact of symptoms on daily life, and impact of environment on symptoms.</description>

    <measure>TBUT</measure>
    <time_frame>The treatment period for each enrolled subject is one month</time_frame>
    <description>Drop 1 drop of 0.3% sodium fluorescein eye solution into the subject's conjunctival sac, dry it with a sterile cotton swab, and ask him to blink gently to make the fluorescein sodium evenly distributed. Observe the subject from the last time with a slit lamp cobalt blue light. The time from blinking to the first dark spot on the corneal surface, record three times and take the average</description>

    <time_frame>The treatment period for each enrolled subject is one month</time_frame>
    <description>Fold one end of the special 5mm×35mm filter paper (Tianjin Jingming) for tears by 5mm, and gently place it on the middle and outer 1/3 of the subject's lower eyelid conjunctival sac, and the other end will droop naturally. Ask the subject to gently close their eyes for 5 minutes After measuring the length of the filter paper wetted by tears</description>

    <measure>CFS score</measure>
    <time_frame>The treatment period for each enrolled subject is one month</time_frame>
    <description>Divide the cornea into 5 quadrants (central + nose/temporal/upper/lower), each quadrant has a staining score of 0 to 3 points, and it is specified that no staining is 0 points, and 30 spots are stained as 1 point, and there is flaky staining and fusion 3 points for filament formation, 2 points between the two, the sum of 5 quadrants is the score of the entire cornea, and the CFS score of the entire cornea is 0-15 points.</description>

    <measure>Density and curvature of corneal subbasal nerve</measure>
    <time_frame>The treatment period for each enrolled subject is one month</time_frame>
    <description>Collect corneal subbasal nerve images, 2 images each in the upper, lower, arm, temporal and central areas. Use deep learning methods to analyze nerve density and curvature</description>

    <measure>Tear pain factor content</measure>
    <time_frame>The treatment period for each enrolled subject is one month</time_frame>
    <description>With the aid of a slit lamp, a capillary pipette was used to draw 5 μl tears/eye at the middle and outer edges of the lower eyelid 2/3 of the tear river, and placed in a low protein adhesion EP tube (containing 5 μl 1% BSA) and stored at -80°C. ELISA analyzes the protein levels of PGE2, substance P and NGF in tear fluid.</description>
