  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the impact of cTBS on the incidence of postoperative delirium and changes of&#xD;
      cognitive function in elderly patients after surgery. To explore whether short-term cTBS can&#xD;
      reduce the risk of postoperative delirium as a preventive strategy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative delirium is the most common postoperative complications among elderly.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, there remains no effective medication or intervention been approved in&#xD;
      postoperative delirium. Recent research suggests that continuous theta burst stimulation&#xD;
      (cTBS) has shown positive effect on improving global cognitive function in multiple mental&#xD;
      disorders. However, the effects on cognitive function in postoperative delirium remain&#xD;
      uninvestigated.&#xD;

    <time_frame>3 days after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Severity of postoperative delirium on postoperative day 1, 2 and 3 will be defined according to he Confusion Assessment Method based delirium severity evaluation tool (CAM-S).The sum score of CAM-S ranges from 0 (no) to 19 (most severe).</description>

    <description>Our active treatment will consist of 600 pulses per session, delivered over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex at 80% of resting motor threshold (RMT). Every session cTBS consists of 50 Hz triplets of pulses delivered at 5 Hz for 40 seconds for a total of 600 pulses. Every set simulation includes 3 sessions. All enrolled patient in the cTBS group will receive 1 set simulation per day with an intersession interval (ISI) of over 30 minutes during the hospitalization after the surgery. The first set of stimulation will be given at 4 hours after the end of surgery on the day of surgery. The other sets of stimulation will be given at 8 am, 8:30 am and 9:00 am on postoperative day 1,2 and 3, respectively.</description>

    <description>The sham stimulation group will receive a sham cTBS (600 pulses per session, 3 sessions per day, ISI ≥ 30mins, 4 days) with the coil set at 90 against the skull. The first set of stimulation will be given at 4 hours after the end of surgery on the day of surgery. The other sets of stimulation will be given at 8 am, 8:30 am and 9:00 am on postoperative day 1,2 and 3, respectively.</description>
