      The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of self-administered intranasal cooling for&#xD;
      the symptomatic relief of migraine headache and associated symptoms in an &quot;at home setting&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10-20 patients - who have been diagnosed according to the International Classification of&#xD;
      Headache disorders (2nd Edition) criteria for Episodic migraine, with or without aura - will&#xD;
      be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During a screening period of one month participants will record their migraine symptoms, any&#xD;
      treatment and treatment effects. After a minimum om two migraine attacks the participants&#xD;
      receive individual instructions on how to use the The RhinoChill® system. During the&#xD;
      following treatment period of the study, participants are instructed to treat their upcoming&#xD;
      three migraine attacks with 10 minutes of nasal cavity cooling according to the instructions&#xD;
      and thereby register symptoms and treatment effects after 10 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 24&#xD;
      hours and 48 hours.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mechanical techniques to alleviate migraine symptoms have been used for many years, cooling&#xD;
      and compression being the most frequently applied. Cryotherapy is the most common&#xD;
      non-pharmacological self-administered pain-relieving method currently used by migraine&#xD;
      sufferers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RhinoChill® System is a CE-Marked device that is currently commercially available in&#xD;
      Europe. The RhinoChill® device is intended for temperature reduction in patients via the&#xD;
      nasal cavity and can be used across a range of medical and surgical indications where&#xD;
      reduction in patient temperature is required. The RhinoChill® system was originally designed&#xD;
      specifically for use in the pre-hospital, in-hospital, in-clinic or other clinical settings&#xD;
      for the induction of therapeutic hypothermia (reduction in brain and body temperature to&#xD;
      between 32-34oC), in which other commercial cooling systems are not practical for use. The&#xD;
      RhinoChill® system is portable and runs on batteries. The system cools by spraying an&#xD;
      evaporative coolant into the nasal cavity via intranasal catheters. A previous study has&#xD;
      shown that the use of RhinoChill® intranasal cooling within a clinic environment provided a&#xD;
      statistically significant reduction of pain and associated symptoms of migraine at 5 and 10&#xD;
      minutes (during treatment) and at 1 and 2 hours following treatment along with significant&#xD;
      effect on pain and symptoms at 24 hours (all p values &lt;0.001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of intranasal cooling for the symptomatic&#xD;
      relief of migraine headache and associated symptoms when the treatment is self-administered&#xD;
      by the patient at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will be single group assignment with treatment self-administered by&#xD;
      patients in their own home, with support and oversight from research support staff working&#xD;
      under the direction of the investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study process is as summarized:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be identified through adverts at Lund University and are able to register&#xD;
      interest via telephone or email. They are then contacted by a researcher by telephone for a&#xD;
      brief eligibility check and to book a first meeting at the Braincool office.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meeting 1, at Braincool office (researcher and research support team):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eligibility check - stage one (Case Report Form 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Trial information, viewing of device and catheter&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Informed Consent Form complete&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Instruction on how to register migraine attack symptoms and treatment effects in&#xD;
           application/CRF2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening period starts. When the participant has registered two migraine attacks during the&#xD;
      screeing period the next meeting is booked:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meeting 2, home visit (research support team):&#xD;
&#xD;
      o Training on how to use the RhinoChill® device safely and how to register migraine symptoms&#xD;
      and treatment effects in application/CRF 3&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the following treatment period of the study, participants are instructed to treat&#xD;
      their upcoming three migraine attacks with 10 minutes of nasal cavity cooling according to&#xD;
      the instructions and thereby register symptoms and treatment effects after 10 minutes, 1&#xD;
      hour, 2 hours, 24 hours and 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the participant has used the RhinoChill® device to treat three episodes of migraine, or&#xD;
      a duration of 3 months post-study has passed, the final meeting is booked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meeting 3, home visit (research support team):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collection of device and other equipment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation on any side effects/adverse events/CRF 4.&#xD;
