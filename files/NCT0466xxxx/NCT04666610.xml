    <time_frame>Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>A 24-hour ambulatory electroencephalogram (EEG) will be performed at day 14. The awake hours from the EEG will be analyzed for absence seizures. Every 24-hour EEG will include hyperventilation as a standard provocation test at the beginning of the EEG. Patient will be regarded as not meeting the criteria for absence seizure freedom if they received benzodiazepine in the 4 days prior to the EEG or during the EEG.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of participants who met the criteria for absence seizure freedom during the randomized withdrawal (RDW) period as determined by electroencephalogram (EEG)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Week 13 to Week 17</time_frame>
    <description>Study participants (or their care givers) who believe they are experiencing a recurrence of absence seizures will contact the clinical site for a 1-hour EEG (with hyperventilation (HV)). If no absence seizure is observed during this 1hr EEG (locally read), the study participant will receive a 24-hour ambulatory EEG. If an absence seizure is observed during either EEG, the study participant will be considered as not Absence seizure free and leave the study. If no absence seizures are determined by 1/24hr ambulatory EEG the participant will conduct a 24-hour EEG at week 17. Patient will be regarded as not meeting the criteria for absence seizure freedom if they received benzodiazepine in the 4 days prior to the EEG or during the EEG.&#xD;
The awake hours from the EEG will be analyzed for absence seizures. Every 24-hour EEG will include HV as a standard provocation test at the beginning of the EEG.</description>

    <ipd_description>Data from this trial may be requested by qualified researchers six months after product approval in the US and/or Europe, or global development is discontinued, and 18 months after trial completion. Investigators may request access to anonymized individual patient-level data and redacted trial documents which may include: analysis-ready datasets, study protocol, annotated case report form, statistical analysis plan, dataset specifications, and clinical study report. Prior to use of the data, proposals need to be approved by an independent review panel at www.Vivli.org and a signed data sharing agreement will need to be executed. All documents are available in English only, for a prespecified time, typically 12 months, on a password protected portal. This plan may change if the risk of re-identifying trial participants is determined to be too high after the trial is completed; in this case and to protect participants, individual patient-level data would not be made available.</ipd_description>
