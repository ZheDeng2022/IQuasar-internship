      Introduction: Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is characterized by progressive atherosclerosis in&#xD;
      coronary arteries and may cause coronary artery stenosis or acute thrombus and occlusion. IHD&#xD;
      is often treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with balloon dilatation and&#xD;
      implantation of a stent. The drug-eluting stents (DES) have been developed to minimize&#xD;
      neointimal growth after implantation and reduce the risk of in-stent restenosis compared to&#xD;
      bare-metal stents (BMS). Newer devices, bioresorbable scaffold (BRS), are made from a&#xD;
      bioresorbable material slowly dissolving after implantation. The BRS guarantees optimal&#xD;
      vessel support after balloon dilatation and implantation, but the artery can obtain original&#xD;
      function and flexibility after the BRS has vanished. The development of the Magmaris BRS,&#xD;
      with its improved radial strength, thinner struts compared to previous BRSs, is developed to&#xD;
      reduce the complications seen in earlier generation BRS such as recoil, fracture and late&#xD;
      stent thrombosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have shown that coronary lesions treated with the previous generation of the&#xD;
      Magmaris BRS resulted on lumen area reduction, possibly a consequence by increased plaque&#xD;
      burden, compromising the scaffold area, combined with increased neointimal formation in the&#xD;
      early phase of vascular healing and fast resolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to decreased radial strength of the BRS compared to metal stents, modification of plaque&#xD;
      prior to BRS-implantation is necessary. The ScoreFlex balloon is a non-compliant balloon with&#xD;
      circumference of fixated, scoring elements and permits controlled expansion and fragmentation&#xD;
      of calcified plaque, compared to standard treatments with a non-compliant balloon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravascular imaging with Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) and Optical Coherence Tomography&#xD;
      (OCT) can assess the morphology and location of plaques in the coronary stenosis prior to PCI&#xD;
      thereby optimizing the implantation. The scaffold-treated segment can also be evaluated with&#xD;
      intravascular imaging components such as stent coverage, malapposition and neointimal&#xD;
      hyperplasia, but only if the scaffold is visible. If the scaffold is dissolved, another&#xD;
      method to assess the vascular healing is needed. IVUS can evaluate change in elastic external&#xD;
      membrane (EEM), change in remodeling and minimal lumen area (MLA). The reduction in MLA is&#xD;
      associated with increased neointimal hyperplasia and plaque burden in the vessel wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to investigate if lesion preparation with a ScoreFlex balloon&#xD;
      compared to a standard non-compliant balloon improve vascular healing and minimize lumen&#xD;
      reduction after implantation of a Magmaris bioresorbable scaffold.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: The study is designed as a prospective randomized trial conduced at a single center&#xD;
      (Odense University Hospital, Denmark). Eighty-two patients with stable angina pectoris and&#xD;
      non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarctions are included, if they meet the criteria.&#xD;
      Pre-dilatation with a 2.0 mm balloon is performed followed by pre-interventional IVUS and&#xD;
      OCT. Patients are randomized to lesion preparation and pre-dilatation with either the&#xD;
      ScoreFlex balloon or a standard non-compliant balloon with a 1:1 balloon-to-artery ratio by&#xD;
      measuring the reference segments. The residual stenosis should be less than 20 %. If the&#xD;
      pre-dilatation goal is not achieved, up-scaling to a balloon 0,5 mm larger is allowed. The&#xD;
      lesion is treated with implantation of a Magmaris scaffold. Finally, IVUS and OCT-images of&#xD;
      the final result are obtained. Follow-up IVUS and OCT images are performed after 6 and 12&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-PCI OCT-images are analyzed at baseline and 6 and 12 months after index procedure.&#xD;
      Change in MLA in the stented segment is measured with IVUS and OCT. The vascular healing is&#xD;
      based on finding from the OCT images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is submitted and approved by the Regional Committees on Health Research Ethics for&#xD;
      Southern Denmark (Project-ID: S-20200114) and Danish Data Agency (Journal nr.: 20/49900)&#xD;
      Statistics: Assuming data are normally distributed, categorical data will be presented as&#xD;
      numbers and frequencies and compared using chi2-test. Continuous data will be presented as&#xD;
      mean Â± SD and compared using Student t-test- SPSS version 26.0 will be used for the&#xD;
      statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The estimated sample size is based on data, from the HONEST study by Fallesen et al. The&#xD;
      reduction of MLA from 6.99 mm2 to 5.01 mm (27%) 6 months after implantation of a Magmaris&#xD;
      BRS, represented the expected reference group. Optimal lesion preparation with pre-dilatation&#xD;
      with a ScoreFlex balloon is estimated to minimize MLA reduction from 6.99 mm2 to 6.22 mm2&#xD;
      (11%). A power calculation is conducted using the expected MLA after 6 months (6.22 mm2 for&#xD;
      the ScoreFlex balloon and 5.01 mm2 for the standard non-compliant balloon). Inclusion of 35&#xD;
      patients in each group is necessary to reach statistical significance in case of 2-tailed&#xD;
      significance level of 0.05 and power of 80 %. Loss to follow-up and poor image quality&#xD;
      finalize an expected drop-out rate of 15 %, thereby requiring 82 patients in total.&#xD;
