    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase Ib, open label, single arm, adaptive multi-centre clinical study. The&#xD;
      target population for this study are patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM).&#xD;
      Patients will have a confirmed diagnosis of MM, with measurable disease as per IMWG criteria,&#xD;
      in the second relapse and beyond (third line of therapy and beyond). Patients will need to&#xD;
      have exposure to lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor. Patients will be treated with&#xD;
      Cyclophosphamide-Pomalidomide-Dexamethasone (CPD) in combination with daratumumab (DARA) to&#xD;
      determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) and Recommended&#xD;
      Phase II Dose (RP2D) of the combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pomalidomide will be administered orally at three dose levels 4, 3 and 2mg on days 1-21 of&#xD;
      each 28-day cycle. Treatment will be repeated on day 1 of a 28-day cycle until disease&#xD;
      progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, physician's decision, or sponsor's&#xD;
      decision to terminate the study, whichever occurs first.&#xD;

      Primary Objective 1. To determine the MTD and RP2D for pomalidomide that can safely be&#xD;
      administered with DARA and cyclophosphamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To determine the incidence of DLT within the first cycle of CPD in combination with DARA&#xD;
      at each dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the CPD-DARA regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate efficacy measures. Secondary Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Safety will be assessed by standard clinical and laboratory tests (haematology, serum&#xD;
      chemistry). Adverse events grade will be defined by the NCI CTCAE (National Cancer Institute&#xD;
      Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) version 5.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. The following efficacy endpoints will be measured: i. Complete Response (CR) rate after&#xD;
      six cycles of CPD-DARA and at the end of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. Best Overall Response. iii. Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) negative rate after six cycles&#xD;
      of CPD-DARA. iv. Progression Free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS) at 6 months and 2&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      v. Time to Response. Exploratory Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess effect of CPD-DARA treatment on patient-reported outcomes and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Efficacy according to the IMWG (International Myeloma Working Group) in High Risk vs&#xD;
           Standard Risk patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Disease Control Rate (DCR). Exploratory Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To assess effect of CPD-DARA treatment on patient-reported outcomes and quality of life,&#xD;
      as assessed by the FACT-G and MyPOS questionnaires completed at study commencement, at every&#xD;
      cycle of study treatment and at completion of the study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Efficacy according to the IMWG in High Risk (defined by ISS stage 3 and/or high-risk&#xD;
      cytogenetic findings including t(4;14), t(14;16), and del17p) vs Standard Risk patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Disease Control Rate (DCR) defined as stable disease or better.&#xD;
