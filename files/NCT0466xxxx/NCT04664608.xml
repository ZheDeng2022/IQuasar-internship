  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand if a new, smart, wireless EEG developed by our&#xD;
      team can be used to monitor the continuous electrical activity of the brain in the ICU and&#xD;
      EMU and whether it works as well as the current standard, wired EEGs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to 1) optimize these devices for use in pediatric ICU patients, 2)&#xD;
      demonstrate safety, reliability, and accuracy of these devices for continuous ICU EEG signal&#xD;
      measurements, and 3) demonstrate these devices are preferred by patients and parents to&#xD;
      current EEG devices. Once validated, such sensors could fundamentally change the way patients&#xD;
      are monitored by EEG in the ICU, allowing wireless, continuous, real-time detection of brain&#xD;
      wave activity in ICU patients, reducing limitations in mobility as well as access by staff&#xD;
      and caregivers to the patient, and ultimately offering opportunity to reduce morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality in ICU patients.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Any patient or family determined by an attending physician or bedside care team to be&#xD;
             too unstable (patient) or experiencing too much stress (family) will not be approached&#xD;
             for recruitment.&#xD;
