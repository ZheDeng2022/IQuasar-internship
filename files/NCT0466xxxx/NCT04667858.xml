      This study will assess the ease of use of a Home Ovulation Test when used by lay-users for&#xD;
      one cycle in their home environment. The home ovulation test to be used in the study is a&#xD;
      visual home ovulation test used to detect luteinising hormone (LH) in urine to identify when&#xD;
      ovulation is imminent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size of 120 volunteers (minimum) will provide adequate information for assessing the&#xD;
      usability of the home ovulation test. Usability of the test will be assessed through a&#xD;
      questionnaire completed at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observational study will be conducted remotely and volunteers representative of the&#xD;
      intended user (lay-users) will be recruited.&#xD;
