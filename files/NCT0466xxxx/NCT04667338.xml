  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to review information of people with a sleep condition called narcolepsy.&#xD;
      Narcolepsy is a condition that causes extreme sleepiness during the day including falling&#xD;
      asleep suddenly. Study doctors will review the medical records of the participants from sleep&#xD;
      clinics in Spain. They will do this from 1 year before the participant was diagnosed with&#xD;
      narcolepsy up to the start of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will visit the sleep clinic once. During this visit, the study doctors will&#xD;
      carry out a short medical exam. Participants will also complete a few questionnaires during&#xD;
      this visit. If participants cannot visit the clinic for any reason, the clinic staff will&#xD;
      arrange a phone call instead.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-interventional, cross-sectional study with retrospective medical chart review&#xD;
      conducted in public and private Spanish sleep clinics, to describe the management of adult&#xD;
      participants diagnosed with narcolepsy defined by ICDS-3 in real world practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll approximately 196 participants (137 with NT1 and 59 with NT2).&#xD;
      Participants will be enrolled in 2 cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort A: NT1 Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort B: NT2 Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be collected retrospectively through clinical records and at study visit&#xD;
      (clinical and demographic data, and participant related outcomes [PRO]) in an electronic case&#xD;
      report form (eCRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center study will be conducted in Spain. The overall duration of this study is&#xD;
      approximately 24 months. Participants will attend a single visit in the participating&#xD;
      centers. In the event of a possible outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)&#xD;
      participants will have a telepathic visits, the invitation to participate, the obtention of&#xD;
      participant's informed consent and the collection of participant's questionnaires will be&#xD;
      carried out remotely (by phone or via email).&#xD;

    <description>Behavioral measure of working memory, attention, and impulse/inhibitory control - The Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART) is a computer-based go/no-go task that requires participants to withhold behavioral response to a single, infrequent target (often the digit 3) presented amongst a background of frequent non-targets (0-2, 4-9). After each block, two probe questions are presented in succession. The first asks, &quot;Where was your attention focused during this block of trials?&quot; Participants respond on a 6-point Likert scale, where 1 represents, &quot;on task,&quot; and 6, &quot;off task.&quot; A second question asks, &quot;How aware were you of where your attention was during this block of trials?&quot; Participants respond on a similar scale, where 1 represents, &quot;aware,&quot; and 6, &quot;unaware.&quot;</description>

    <measure>Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>From a year before narcolepsy diagnosis up to study visit (approximately 24 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The MWT is a validated objective measure that evaluates a person's ability to remain awake under soporific conditions for a defined period of time. This tendency to fall asleep is measured via electroencephalography-derived sleep latency. Sleep onset is defined as the first epoch of greater than 15 seconds of cumulative sleep in a 30-second epoch. During each MWT session (1 session equals to [=] 40 minutes), participants will be instructed to sit quietly and remain awake for as long as possible. If no sleep has been observed according to these rules, then the latency is defined as 40 minutes. MWT sleep latency ranges from 0 to 40 minutes, with higher scores indicating greater ability to stay awake.</description>

Each dimension has 3 response categories corresponding to no problems, some problems, and extreme problems. The instrument is designed for self-completion, and respondents also rate their overall health on the day of the interview on a 0-100 hash-marked, vertical visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS). Higher score indicates better health state.</description>
