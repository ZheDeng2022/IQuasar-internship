  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study investigators are conducting an observational, parallel group pharmacokinetic (PK)&#xD;
      study among women living with HIV (WLHIV) already on 1st line antiretroviral therapy (ART)&#xD;
      and virally suppressed, 18-45 years old (inclusive), to evaluate any bidirectional drug-drug&#xD;
      interactions (DDIs) between doravirine (DOR)-containing ART and hormonal contraceptive&#xD;
      methods. This PK study will enroll women in five distinct groups, each with 21 participants&#xD;
      (total of 105 participants), and follow them for approximately 18-30 weeks.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While DOR-containing ART has been evaluated in two large clinical trials, only 16-17% of the&#xD;
      study participants were women and only 6-10% of them were African. In an epidemic, where the&#xD;
      gendered majority affected by the disease are women of reproductive age living in Africa, it&#xD;
      is imperative to conduct a study evaluating reproductive health outcomes among and specific&#xD;
      to African women. Further underscoring the issue is a notable data gap for DOR regarding DDIs&#xD;
      with the most common leading hormonal contraceptives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our intention is to study potential DDIs between DOR and the most common contraceptive&#xD;
      methods used by WLHIV in an African context, which generally include short- (e.g.,&#xD;
      OCPs/COCs), intermediate (e.g., injectable) or long-acting (e.g., implants or IUDs) methods.&#xD;
      Since the drug maker of DOR has already conducted the industry standard PK study with DOR and&#xD;
      a COC product, containing ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel, which did not demonstrate any&#xD;
      bidirectional DDI, the investigators have chosen to exclude this method from the current&#xD;
      study. Thus, the current EPIC study focuses on intermediate- and long-acting contraceptive&#xD;
      methods, which have different PK profiles than daily administrated oral drugs and may be more&#xD;
      susceptible to potential DDIs with DOR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who are interested in self-selecting and initiating one of the study&#xD;
      contraceptive methods listed will be recruited for screening and eligibility assessments. If&#xD;
      eligible and enrolled, there will be a 6-week lead-in period with daily use of oral&#xD;
      DOR-containing ART followed by contraceptive method initiation of their choice. Study&#xD;
      follow-up will take place every 2-4 weeks, at a minimum, for an additional 12 or 24 weeks for&#xD;
      a total of 18 or 30 weeks of follow-up depending on the contraceptive method chosen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also enroll a dolutegravir (DTG) + IM DMPA group, who will be followed&#xD;
      for 12 weeks, as the comparator group for the DOR + IM DMPA group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The comparator group for the DOR + ETG implant group will be a historical control group from&#xD;
      a similar PK study called PARVI (PK study of ARVs and Implants in Kenya) that is currently&#xD;
      being conducted by Dr. Patel and colleagues in Kenya.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The five study groups are summarized below in Table 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Table 1: Study groups by ART regimen and contraceptive method choice&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group number N ART regimen and contraceptive method Group 1 21 DOR-containing ART +&#xD;
      initiating ETG implant Group 2 21 DOR-containing ART + initiating IM DMPA Group 3 21&#xD;
      DOR-containing ART + initiating SC MPA Group 4 21 DOR-containing ART + initiating&#xD;
      non-hormonal IUD Group 5 21 DTG-containing ART + initiating IM DMPA&#xD;
&#xD;
      The co-primary objectives are to evaluate any associations between doravirine (DOR), a newer&#xD;
      antiretroviral agent for the treatment of HIV, exposure and hormonal contraceptive use in the&#xD;
      four groups of DOR + 1) etonogestrel implant (ETG), 2) intramuscular depomedroxyprogesterone&#xD;
      acetate (IM DMPA), 3) subcutaneous medroxyprogesterone acetate (SC MPA), or 4) non-hormonal&#xD;
      IUD users by generating mean hormone concentrations at 12 weeks for IM and SC DMPA or 24&#xD;
      weeks for ETG implants and IUD groups; also to evaluate any bi-directional associations&#xD;
      between hormonal contraceptive exposure and DOR use by generating mean DOR concentration at&#xD;
      24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first hypotheses are: the mean implant hormone concentrations for DOR + ETG implant at 24&#xD;
      weeks after implant placement will be similar (i.e. geometric mean ratio [GMR] within 0.80&#xD;
      and 1.25) to the mean implant hormone concentrations for DTG + ETG implant (historical&#xD;
      controls from Dr. Patel's current PARVI study in a similar population in Kenya). The mean MPA&#xD;
      concentrations for DOR + IM DMPA or SC MPA at 12 weeks after DMPA/MPA administration will be&#xD;
      similar (i.e. GMR within 0.8 and 1.25) to the mean DMPA concentrations for DTG + DMPA&#xD;
      (contemporaneous study group). Also, the mean C24 hours of DOR in the ETG implant and MPA&#xD;
      groups will be similar to the non-hormonal contraceptive method (i.e. the non-hormonal IUD)&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to measure DOR-containing ART's efficacy, via HIV viral load &lt;40&#xD;
      copies/mL, at 12-24 weeks after contraceptive initiation among women of reproductive age&#xD;
      using hormonal and non-hormonal contraceptives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second hypothesis is that proportion of women suppressed (defined as HIV viral load &lt;40&#xD;
      copies/mL) at 16-30 weeks after DOR-containing ART initiation will be similar to a&#xD;
      contemporaneous or historical comparison of the proportion of women suppressed with non-DOR&#xD;
      containing ART from the same study population/sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exploratory objectives are to qualitatively explore decision-making around ART and&#xD;
      contraceptive options, study experiences of ART switch, and use of the contraceptive method,&#xD;
      including self-administration of SC MPA, and to describe self-reported experiences of social&#xD;
      harms and social benefits related to study participation. Also, safety including side&#xD;
      effects, satisfaction, and continuation rates of both the hormonal contraceptive method and&#xD;
      ART will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third hypothesis is that the safety, satisfaction, and continuation rates of the various&#xD;
      contraceptive methods will be similar to each other at 12-24 weeks after contraceptive&#xD;
      initiation. The investigators will gain interesting insights into women's decision-making&#xD;
      around ART and contraceptive method options and are uniquely positioned to describe&#xD;
      experiences of self-administration of SC MPA.&#xD;
