    <textblock>
      The microcirculation plays a fundamental role in metabolic reactions and has been shown as an&#xD;
      essential determinant in many clinical scenarios such as shock states, chronic and&#xD;
      cardio-metabolic diseases. Microcirculation can be assessed directly using laser-based&#xD;
      techniques and intravital microscopes. When combined with provocation tests, microvascular&#xD;
      monitorization can be used to assess microvascular function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laser-based techniques are consist of two different methods named laser doppler imaging&#xD;
      (LDI), laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI). LSCI is a technique based on speckle contrast&#xD;
      analysis that provides an index of blood flux. No need for skin contact, continuous and&#xD;
      real-time assessment of the microcirculation led the LSCI to be broadly used in clinical&#xD;
      practice. LDI is also a non-invasive diagnostic method used to measure the blood flux of&#xD;
      tissue. The technique is based on measuring the doppler shift induced by moving red blood&#xD;
      cells to the illuminating coherent light. Iontophoresis is one of the most commonly used&#xD;
      provocation tests to study the endothelium in terms of endothelium-dependent and&#xD;
      endothelium-independent vasodilation. Simultaneously with LDI and LSCI are used to follow and&#xD;
      assess the skin blood flux during iontophoresis. Therefore, it provides a state to make a&#xD;
      comparison between two different laser-based techniques in terms of flux characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The accurate assessment of burn depth is a critical step in the management of the&#xD;
      burn-injured patient. Currently, LDI is the most widely used non-invasive measurement tool&#xD;
      for assessing burn wounds and the only technique approved by the U.S. Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration. However, the LDI device is rather costly, cumbersome, and has a poor spatial&#xD;
      resolution. LSCI measures perfusion in a similar way, but it provides high-quality images&#xD;
      with a much higher spatial resolution. In addition, LSCI is much quicker, maneuverable, and&#xD;
      able to assess larger skin areas. In order to use the LSCI technique in the clinical practice&#xD;
      of burn-injured patients, as a first step, the linearity of LDI and LSCI should be shown. In&#xD;
      this study, we aimed to compare LSCI and LDI with iontophoresis and stepwise occlusion&#xD;
      technique. So, we will test the linearity of devices over a large range of blood flux values.&#xD;

      Measurements of microcirculation were initiated upon the ethical consent was approved. 15&#xD;
      healthy volunteer were included in the study. All volunteers were asked for the existence of&#xD;
      any symptoms for the on-going disease like flu, infectious disease, and chronic disease&#xD;
      (Diabetes, hypertension, rheumatologic disorders, epileptic disorders, etc.). Once the&#xD;
      volunteer met inclusion criteria, he/she became eligible for study. Volunteers were advised&#xD;
      to beware from food and drink for at least two hours before measurement. Also, they were&#xD;
      advised to come at least two hours after big meals like lunch or dinner. All the volunteers&#xD;
      were evaluated at the same position (sitting and hand at heart level), room and temperature&#xD;
      to provide equal standards. The volunteer had rest for at least 30 minutes in a&#xD;
      semi-recumbent and extending leg position. The room temperature was 24-26C and checked with a&#xD;
      thermometer intermittently. The door was closed to prevent air movement. Lights were switched&#xD;
      off, and the curtains were closed to prevent the effect of light on devices. Once all the&#xD;
      environmental conditions met, two investigators evaluated the volunteer. One investigator&#xD;
      checked the volunteer's blood pressure, temperature, and heart rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A vacuum pillow was used to hold the arm stable during the procedure. Two different devices&#xD;
      (laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) and laser doppler imaging (LDI)) were ready next to&#xD;
      the volunteer. An appropriate intact skin area, inner side of the forearm were used for the&#xD;
      investigation and both electrodes were attached. The skin surface was cleaned with alcohol or&#xD;
      deionized water to remove remnants of cosmetics and creams with low conductivity. This helped&#xD;
      to prevent spots with high current density that may result in local burns and non-specific&#xD;
      vascular reactions. After peeling off the protective tape layer on the bottom of the Drug&#xD;
      Delivery Electrode, the electrode was firmly attached to the skin. The Dispersive Electrode&#xD;
      was placed approximately 10-15 cm from the Drug Delivery Electrode. Power supply was&#xD;
      connected by attaching the electrodes to the leads. After lifting the lid of the Drug&#xD;
      Delivery Electrode using the pointed tab, tip of the syringe was slided under the lid of the&#xD;
      Drug Delivery Electrode and the Drug Delivery Chamber was filled with approximately 0.5 mL of&#xD;
      a 10 mg/ml SNP solution. The drug was then delivered using cathodal iontophoresis for 1&#xD;
      minute with a current strength of 200 µA. The LDI and LSCI instruments are positioned so they&#xD;
      can alternately measure the delivery site. Basal perfusion was measured with both instruments&#xD;
      before starting iontophoresis. Subsequently, iontophoresis was started and measurements are&#xD;
      made alternating between the two instruments. Therefore, we would be able to compare both&#xD;
      devices in terms of supra-baseline flux values. When all measurements were finished, the&#xD;
      electrodes removed from the patient and the Drug Delivery Electrode and the Dispersive&#xD;
      Electrode was removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second part of the study was performed as step-wise occlusion. The arm which was not used&#xD;
      for iontophoresis test was used for step-wise occlusion. The baseline blood flux was followed&#xD;
      for 2 minutes by LDI and LSCI. After 2 minutes, the upper arm was occluded for 30 seconds&#xD;
      with a pneumatic cuff up to 50 mmHg, 80 mmHg, 110 mmHg, 140 mmHg, and 170 mmHg. Between each&#xD;
      part, the volunteer had rest for 5 minutes to let the blood flux to turn the baseline. Once&#xD;
      reaching to the planned pressure, LSCI and LDI devices were alternately be used to record&#xD;
      blood flux. Therefore, we were able to compare both devices in terms of sub-baseline flux&#xD;
      values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data were recorded in 2 external electronic storage, and the names of the volunteers were&#xD;
      coded with numbers. Only main investigator was aware of who corresponds to which number.&#xD;
      Results of Perimed and Moore Devices were analyzed with the software PIMsoft 1.5 (Perimed AB,&#xD;
      Järfälla, Sweden), MoorLDI2-BI Burn's Software Version 4.0, respectively. Two investigators&#xD;
      performed the analysis. If one investigator made the analysis, the other checked the results,&#xD;
      as well.&#xD;
