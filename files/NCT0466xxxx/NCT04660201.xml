    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, Phase 1 study designed to assess safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and immunogenicity 2 formulations of adjuvanted anthrax vaccine (AV7909),&#xD;
      lyophilized and liquid. Forty healthy young adults, 18 to 45 years old, inclusive, who meet&#xD;
      all eligibility criteria, will be randomly allocated to one of two study groups in a 1:1&#xD;
      ratio: 20 will receive AV7909 as the thermostable lyophilized product and 20 will receive&#xD;
      AV7909 as the liquid product. The vaccines will be given intramuscularly in a 2-dose&#xD;
      schedule, 2 weeks apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be assessed by evaluation of non-serious unsolicited Adverse Events, Serious&#xD;
      Adverse Events (SAEs), Medically Attended Adverse Events (MAAEs), Adverse Events of Special&#xD;
      Interest (AESIs) [the AESIs collected in this study are Potentially Immune-Mediated Medical&#xD;
      Conditions (PIMMCs)], and by laboratory evaluations. Reactogenicity will be measured by the&#xD;
      occurrence of solicited injection site and systemic reactions in the week after each study&#xD;
      vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunogenicity testing will include performing serological assays to assess for toxin&#xD;
      neutralizing antibodies (reported as ED50 and NF50), the gold standard assay for assessing&#xD;
      response and protection following anthrax vaccines, prior to vaccination and on approximately&#xD;
      Days 8, 15, 22, 29, 64, 195, and 380. In addition, anti-PA IgG antibodies will be measured by&#xD;
      ELISA from the serum of participants, on those same days. The primary safety objective of&#xD;
      this study is to assess the safety of lyophilized and liquid formulations of AV7909. The&#xD;
      primary tolerability objective is to assess the tolerability of lyophilized and liquid&#xD;
      formulations of AV7909.&#xD;

      ratio: 20 will receive AV7909 as the thermostable lyophilized product and 20 will receive&#xD;
      AV7909 as the liquid product. Stratification by age category and by gender will assure that&#xD;
      near equal numbers of younger (18-30 years) and older (31-45 years) males and females are&#xD;
      assigned to each vaccine. The vaccines will be given intramuscularly in a 2-dose schedule, 2&#xD;
      weeks apart.&#xD;
