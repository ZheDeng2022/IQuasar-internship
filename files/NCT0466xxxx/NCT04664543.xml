  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One tricky aspect of the recommendations for colonoscopy prep is diet. This has a significant&#xD;
      impact on the experience of the patient or participant in the screening program and, on the&#xD;
      other hand, low adherence has been found in some studies despite a potential Hawthorne effect&#xD;
      . It is noteworthy that despite its impact on patient experience, it is an area for which&#xD;
      little evidence is available, which is why the guidelines give low-quality recommendations&#xD;
      and there is probably considerable variability in clinical practice .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the early days of colonoscopy, a liquid diet for 48 hours was mainly recommended, although&#xD;
      some centers indicated a low-residue diet or even the commercially available NASA astronaut&#xD;
      diet. Later, the indication for a liquid diet was consolidated until finally numerous studies&#xD;
      were published in favor of a low-residue diet, managing to increase tolerance and the quality&#xD;
      of the preparation . A limitation of the preparation studies must be borne in mind that the&#xD;
      colon cleansing rating scales were not introduced until 1999 when the Aronchick scale was&#xD;
      published.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there is solid evidence in favor of a low-residue diet versus a liquid diet, the&#xD;
      investigators do not have evidence on how many days of a low-residue diet should be&#xD;
      recommended, and this is reflected in the ESGE (European Society of Gastrointestinal&#xD;
      Endoscopy) and ASGE (American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy) guidelines . A&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial comparing 3 days versus 1 day of a low residue diet has recently&#xD;
      been published . There were no statistically significant differences in the rate of adequate&#xD;
      preparations (82.7% vs. 85.6% OR 1.2 95% IC 0.72 to 2.15). However, this study has limited&#xD;
      statistical power and a design that allows a non-inferiority analysis has not been followed.&#xD;
      In relation to this, our research group is finalizing a non-inferiority clinical trial in&#xD;
      whose intermediate analysis, with 421 participants, the non-inferiority of 1 day of diet is&#xD;
      fulfilled (rate of poor preparation in 1 day 0.95% vs. 4.74% in 3 days; d + 5%, difference&#xD;
      -3.78% IC -6.88% to -1.12%) (38).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is likely, taking into account the available evidence and its evolution, that diet plays a&#xD;
      secondary role in preparation. Although no studies designed to directly assess this have been&#xD;
      conducted, the research group has indirect data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Walter et al, under the hypothesis that the impact of the fractional preparation and the new&#xD;
      preparations on the preparation diminished the importance of the diet, conducted a&#xD;
      non-inferiority clinical trial between 2012 and 2013 in which they randomized the patients to&#xD;
      follow a diet liquid versus low residue for one day and fractional preparation with Moviprep&#xD;
      (39). They established a non-inferiority margin of -13.5%. Their results show a rate of good&#xD;
      preparation (Boston&gt; 5) in 68/72 (94.4%) in a liquid diet compared to 60/68 (88.2%) in a&#xD;
      low-residue diet (p = 0.04) with a difference of -5.08% demonstrating non-inferiority of the&#xD;
      low residue diet.&#xD;
