  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center biomarkers study aiming to prospectively collect biological samples&#xD;
      from patients with ER+ and HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer, who are candidate to&#xD;
      first-line treatment with an aromatase inhibitor and a CDK4/6 inhibitor as per standard&#xD;
      clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and tissue samples will be collected for biomarker analysis, including thymidine&#xD;
      kinase1 activity, gene expression signatures and circulating tumor DNA.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Enrolled patients will receive first-line treatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor + AI&#xD;
      (anastrozole, letrozole or exemestane) in accordance with local practice. No drugs will be&#xD;
      provided by the study Sponsor. Following disease progression on first-line therapy,&#xD;
      subsequent, second-line therapy will be administered at physician discretion and as per&#xD;
      physician choice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all participating patients, serum and plasma samples will be collected at the following&#xD;
      time-points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline (&lt; 2 weeks before treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During treatment with CDK4/6 inhibitors + AI: at day 15 (+/- 2) of the first cycle, day&#xD;
           1 (+/-2) of cycle 2, day 1 (+/- 2) of the cycle closest to the first trial-mandated&#xD;
           tumor evaluation (after 12-18 weeks from study inclusion), day 1 (+/- 2) of cycle 6, and&#xD;
           every 6 cycles thereafter&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At disease progression or permanent discontinuation of CDK4/6 inhibitors + AI (within 35&#xD;
           days from last CDK4/6 inhibitor dosing)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the immediate subsequent treatment (second line) (any type, as per physician&#xD;
           choice): at day 1 (+/- 2) of cycle 1 (if &gt; 7 days from last CDK4/6 inhibitors dosing),&#xD;
           at day 1 of cycles 3, 6 and every 6 cycles thereafter&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At disease progression or permanent discontinuation of second line treatment (within 35&#xD;
           days from last dosing)&#xD;
&#xD;
      One sample of whole blood will be collected at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All blood samples will be taken concomitantly with blood draws for routine clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be eligible for the study, availability of material from one formalin fixed and paraffin&#xD;
      embedded (FFPE) tumor block from a baseline biopsy of a metastatic site taken before starting&#xD;
      treatment is mandatory. Although not mandatory for inclusion, material from an archival FFPE&#xD;
      tumor block from the primary breast tumor must also be provided, whenever available.&#xD;
      Additionally, material from one FFPE tumor block of a tissue biopsy from a metastatic site&#xD;
      collected upon disease progression to first-line treatment with CDK4/6 in and AI will be&#xD;
      collected whenever possible&#xD;
