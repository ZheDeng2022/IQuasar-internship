      Abstract:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a common pathology affecting mainly women (sex ratio&#xD;
      1/10), which starts most often during adolescence. The prognosis of the AN remains poor (10%&#xD;
      of deaths and high risk of chronicity). Body dissatisfaction, disturbances in recognition and&#xD;
      identification of body sensations are some of the key symptoms of AN. There is, however, a&#xD;
      contrast between this consensual observation of the importance of troubles in body image in&#xD;
      AN, and the relative deficit of specifically targeted body treatments. Our proposal for a&#xD;
      body approach specifically dedicated to AN is based on the understanding that posture,&#xD;
      breathing, muscle tension and body perception are closely linked to our psychological and&#xD;
      emotional state, and are therefore disturbed in patients with AN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this monocentric randomized controlled trial is to evaluate if a targeted&#xD;
      osteopathic protocol treatment for AN in addition to as-usual care is significantly more&#xD;
      effective compared to as-usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Seventy-two female patients meeting the inclusion criteria will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to one of the two treatment groups : one receiving the specific osteopathic treatment&#xD;
      targeted for AN in addition to the as-usual care (group A) and the other one, the as-usual&#xD;
      care (group B). The patients of group A will receive 5 sessions of osteopathic treatment for&#xD;
      25 minutes. Soft specific palpatory techniques on the diaphragm, digestive system and&#xD;
      cervical region will be realized. The as-usual care is defined by the multidisciplinary&#xD;
      approach recommended by the high authority of health. The primary outcome is the evaluation&#xD;
      of interoceptive sensibility and secondary outcomes include clinical and&#xD;
      psychopathology-related symptoms and assessment of somatic dysfonctions' evolution. A&#xD;
      qualitative study will also be carried out, applying the Interpretative Phenomenological&#xD;
      Analysis method. Patients will be included for a maximum of 14 weeks between the inclusion&#xD;
      time and the last evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the results of the study are positive (statistically significant effectiveness of this&#xD;
      body approach in addition to as-usual care compared to as-usual treatment), patients with&#xD;
      anorexia will be benefit from the possibility of additional treatment that is effective,&#xD;
      relatively inexpensive, non-invasive and non-pharmacological.&#xD;
