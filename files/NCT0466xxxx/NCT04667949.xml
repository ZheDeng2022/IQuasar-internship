    <textblock>
      To assess the efficacy and safety of 0.5mg Fingolimod (Gilenya) in Chinese patients with&#xD;
      relapsing relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 24-month, open-label, multicenter, interventional, single-arm study to collect&#xD;
      efficacy and, safety of oral fingolimod 0.5 mg/day in approximately 100 relapsing multiple&#xD;
      sclerosis (RMS) subjects in China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of three Phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening (up to 1 month): After signing informed consent, subjects will enter a Screening&#xD;
      Phase to determine eligibility according to inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Period (24 months): On visit Day 1, all eligibility criteria will be confirmed,&#xD;
      including a pre-dose ECG and vital signs. The first dose of study drug will be taken in the&#xD;
      clinic on Day 1 and the subject will be monitored for 6 hours after the first dose&#xD;
      administration before discharge. Participants will return to site for evaluation at month 1&#xD;
      and then every three months until the end of treatment up to 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow Up (2 months): Subjects who completed Treatment Period or discontinued from treatment&#xD;
      will return for the Follow-up visit 2 months after the last dose of study drug.&#xD;

    <description>A relapse is an appearance of a new neurological abnormality or worsening of previously stable or improving pre-existing neurological abnormality, separated by at least 30 days from onset of a preceding clinical demyelinating event which is present for at least 24 hours in the absence of fever or infection. A confirmed relapse by Treating Physician must be confirmed within 7 days of onset of symptoms and accompanied by an increase of at least half a step (0.5) on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) or an increase of 1 point on two different Functional Systems (FS) of the EDSS or 2 points on one of the FS.The EDSS is an ordinal scale used for assessing neurologic impairment based on an exam consisting of seven functional systems (FSs)which are scored from 0 to 10 (death from MS) and an ambulation score that are combined to determine the EDSS steps. The higher score means the worsening of neurological status.</description>
