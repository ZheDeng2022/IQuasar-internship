  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to investigate the association between different reperfusion timing&#xD;
      and ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) to provide evidence for clinical decision-making for&#xD;
      patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). All the participants&#xD;
      included in the study were diagnosed with STEMI according to the 4th universal definition of&#xD;
      myocardial infarction, with a follow-up of 1, 6, 12 months, respectively. Symptom&#xD;
      onset-to-reperfusion timing (SO2RT) and 24h-dynamic electrocardiogram parameters were&#xD;
      recorded to compare different SO2RT and VAs during 3 follow-up visits.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is Class I recommendation that STEMI require emergency revascularization with no delay.&#xD;
      However, arrhythmias after acute myocardial infarction (AMI), particularly VAs, also occur in&#xD;
      the early post-MI phase, leading to increased mortality. Previous studies have shown benefits&#xD;
      of late reperfusion to electrical stability. The aim of this study was to investigate the&#xD;
      association between different reperfusion timing and VAs to provide evidence for clinical&#xD;
      decision-making for STEMI. In this multicenter, prospective, observational study, STEMI&#xD;
      participants from July 2019 to December 2020 confirmed according to the 4th universal&#xD;
      definition of myocardial infarction were enrolled, with a follow-up of 1, 6, 12 months,&#xD;
      respectively. SO2RT was defined as the time interval between symptom onset and reperfusion&#xD;
      timing which referred to the timing when coronary angiography showed Thrombolysis In&#xD;
      Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) blood flow level 2~3 immediately after percutaneous coronary&#xD;
      intervention (PCI). The primary end point was VAs on 24h-dynamic electrocardiogram. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes included a composite of death from coronary heart disease, fetal of non-fetal&#xD;
      ischemic stroke, revascularization, or chest pain requiring readmission.&#xD;

        A prospective cohort study was designed to investigate the effects of different reperfusion&#xD;
        timing on VAs in STEMI patients. During the patients' follow-up, 24h-dynamic&#xD;
        electrocardiography, echocardiography were required to record the incidence of primary&#xD;
        outcome and other parameters. Information on SO2RT, demographic characteristics,&#xD;
        hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidemia history, drug use, smoking, drinking, biochemical&#xD;
        indexes and coronary lesions were also collected.&#xD;
