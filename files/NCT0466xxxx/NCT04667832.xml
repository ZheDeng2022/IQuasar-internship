      Large population cross sectional study between 2019-2020 for 4207 new patients that refer to&#xD;
      professor Kojuri cardiovascular clinic in shiraz, Iran, was conducted. Patients were&#xD;
      undergone selective coronary angiography from radial artery approach by an expert&#xD;
      interventional cardiologist. ABI were measured for all patients. ABI ratio was compared with&#xD;
      the results of coronary angiography for patients who underwent coronary angiography to&#xD;
      measure specificity and sensitivity.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This cross-sectional study was conducted between 2019 -2020. Inclusion criteria was all of&#xD;
      the new patients who referred to Professor Kojuri cardiovascular clinic in Shiraz, Iran&#xD;
      (Iran, Fars Province, Shiraz, Niayesh Boulevard kojurij@yahoo.com, http://kojuriclinic.com )&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria was Patients with DVT, Lower extremity wound that cause severe pain and&#xD;
      patients who were unable to remain supine. Patients with ABI more than 1.4 were also&#xD;
      Excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complete history and physical exam were taken from the patients and risk factors such as&#xD;
      smoking, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, age and gender were considered. We&#xD;
      checked triglyceride, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, HbA1c and High&#xD;
      sensitive CRP (Hs-CRP) for all patients. Blood pressure was measured and electrocardiography&#xD;
      (EKG) was taken for all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dyslipidemia were defined as high total or LDL cholesterol, high triglyceride or low HDL&#xD;
      cholesterol. Diabetes diagnosis were based on 2019 American diabetes association guideline.&#xD;
      Hypertension were defined according to American heart association 2017.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Triglyceride more than 200, Total Cholesterol more than 200, LDL more than 100, HDL less than&#xD;
      40 for men and less than 50 for women, HbA1c more than 6.5 and Hs-CRP more than 2 were&#xD;
      considered abnormal. Patients with Hs-CRP more than 10 were excluded due to possibility of&#xD;
      Acute inflammation. Smoking were defined as regular tobacco smoking or past history of&#xD;
      smoking within 3 months before their visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No evidence of abnormal findings in non-invasive studies were considered absence of CAD.&#xD;
      Patients with strongly positive results of noninvasive studies, were undergone selective&#xD;
      coronary angiography from radial artery approach by an expert interventional cardiologist.&#xD;
      Angiography videos were reviewed by a team of expert cardiologists. Based on the results of&#xD;
      coronary angiography, patients were classified as mild proven CAD with stenosis less than 50%&#xD;
      and severe proven CAD with stenosis more than 50% stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ABI performed for all patients with Huntleigh Dopplex ABIlity Automatic Ankle Brachial Index&#xD;
      System. It was made in Cardiff, United kingdom. This device used Doppler ultrasound for&#xD;
      measuring ABI. The appropriate cuffs were selected for patients. Patients were supine 30&#xD;
      minutes before starting test. Ankle and brachial cuffs were attached directly to the&#xD;
      patient's skin. Both left and Right ABI were measured. ABI under 0.9 were considered as&#xD;
      Abnormal ABI. ABI between 0.9 and 1.4 were assumed as Normal ABI. Patients with both right&#xD;
      and left ABI between 0.9 and 1.4 were classified as normal ABI patients. Other patients with&#xD;
      at least right or left ABI under 0.9 were considered as abnormal ABI patients. Inter-arm&#xD;
      systolic pressure difference was also measured for patients. Inter-arm systolic pressure&#xD;
      difference over 10mmhg were considered abnormal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was double-blinded. The team of cardiologists who reported the results of coronary&#xD;
      angiography were blinded about the results of patient's ABI. The statisticians also didn't&#xD;
      have information about the results of ABI and coronary angiography. For blinding, we used&#xD;
      alphabet for each group of patients with or without coronary artery disease. We also used&#xD;
      alphabet for normal or abnormal ABI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For statistical analysis IBM SPSS statistics version 25 was used . Independent sample t test&#xD;
      and one-way ANOVA were used for parametric variables. We used Mann-whitney u test and&#xD;
      Kruskal-Wallis test for nonparametric data. P value 0.05 were assumed significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the patients were informed about the details of this research and written consent were&#xD;
      obtained from them. Patients who disagreed were excluded from this study&#xD;
