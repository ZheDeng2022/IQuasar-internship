  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess whether participants treated with ofatumumab 20 mg subcutaneous (s.c.) administered&#xD;
      once every 4 weeks (q4) can mount an adequate immune response to inactivated influenza&#xD;
      vaccine as measured by humoral responses compared to participants on an iDMT.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Vaccinations against influenza are an important part of effective management of multiple&#xD;
      sclerosis (MS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ofatumumab is a human anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb) which depletes B-cells, a component&#xD;
      of the immune system. This study investigates if ofatumumab treated patients can have an&#xD;
      immune response that may be protective after receiving the influenza vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a one week screening period to assess eligibility for the trial. All eligible&#xD;
      participants will receive an influenza vaccine during the Screening Period prior to the&#xD;
      Investigational Period. This study will enroll 66 participants with relapsing multiple&#xD;
      sclerosis into three cohorts in multiple centers. Up to 44 of the participants will begin&#xD;
      treatment with ofatumumab or will already be receiving commercial ofatumumab. The remaining&#xD;
      22 participants will remain on their Injectable Disease Modifying Therapy (iDMT). There will&#xD;
      be 4 weekly visits during the Investigational Period which will last 4 weeks. There will also&#xD;
      be an optional, 6 month Extension Period for Cohorts 1 and 2, who received ofatumumab, to&#xD;
      further evaluate immune response. Cohort 3 will not enter the Extension Period.&#xD;
