      U.S. multicenter, parallel group study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral&#xD;
      20 mg twice daily (BID) NE3107 vs placebo in 316 adult subjects with mild to moderate AD. Two&#xD;
      coprimary outcome measures (the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive Subscale 12&#xD;
      [ADAS Cog12] and the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Clinical Global Impression of&#xD;
      Change [ADCS CGIC] will be evaluated as the change from Baseline to Week 30. Secondary&#xD;
      endpoints include measures of neuropsychological deficits, functional performance, and&#xD;
      glycemic control. A subset of patients may volunteer for exploratory magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (volumetric changes) and positron emission tomography (cortical glucose metabolic&#xD;
      rate) scans at baseline and week 30.&#xD;

&#xD;
               4. Has an MRI of the brain that is generally supportive of AD upon local reading. A&#xD;
                  CT scan can be substituted only if the subject has an absolute contraindication&#xD;
                  for MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Has evidence of Aβ pathology based on Aβ PET scan conducted coincident with&#xD;
                  diagnosis of AD or use of APTUS™ Aβ42/40 assay during the Screening Period. Scan&#xD;
                  must be completed prior to randomization at V2.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  3. Has a modified Hachinski Ischemic Scale score of ≤4 at Screening (V1). 4. If&#xD;
                  taking an anticholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI) (e.g., donepezil, galantamine,&#xD;
                  rivastigmine) and/or memantine at Screening (V1):&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Must have been taking the medication(s) for ≥3 mo and&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Current dose regimen and form must have remained stable for ≥6 wk prior to&#xD;
                  randomization and must remain stable throughout participation in the study.&#xD;

                  may also be enrolled if initiation of an AChEI and/or memantine is not planned&#xD;
                  for the time period during which the subject will be participating in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  NOTE: Dosage changes during the study due to clinical deterioration should be&#xD;
                  discussed with the Medical Monitor prior to being implemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  5. If taking medications for glycemic control at the time of Screening (V1), must&#xD;
                  be stable on the current dose regimen and form for ≥3 mo prior to randomization&#xD;
                  and must remain stable throughout participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  6. Must meet one of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Females: Surgically sterilized (e.g., hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or&#xD;
                  tubal ligation) for at least 6 mo prior to Screening (V1) or postmenopausal&#xD;
                  (postmenopausal females must have no menstrual bleeding for at least 1 y). If&#xD;
                  needed, the Investigator may confirm postmenopausal status through an FSH&#xD;
                  assessment at Screening [(V1]). If not surgically sterilized or postmenopausal,&#xD;
                  subject must agree to use a highly effective method of contraception that can&#xD;
                  achieve a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and&#xD;
                  correctly, such as hormonal contraception or a double barrier method (e.g.,&#xD;
                  intrauterine device plus condom or true abstinence defined as in line with the&#xD;
                  preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject) while enrolled in the study.&#xD;
                  Methods of periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post&#xD;
                  ovulation) are not acceptable as noted in Section 6.8.1 of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Males: Vasectomized. If not vasectomized, must use an appropriate contraception&#xD;
                  methods (e.g., double barrier or true abstinence defined as in line with the&#xD;
                  preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject) while enrolled in the study.&#xD;
                  Partner methods of periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,&#xD;
                  post ovulation) are not acceptable as noted in Section 6.8.1 of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  7. Must provide voluntary written informed consent prior to Screening (V1). If&#xD;
                  the subject is unable to provide informed consent due to cognitive status, the&#xD;
                  subject must provide assent, and a legally authorized representative provides&#xD;
                  full written informed consent on behalf of the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  8. Willing to allow collection of blood for ApoE genotyping. 9. Able to comply&#xD;
                  with the study procedures, in the opinion of the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  10. Has a primary caregiver/study partner that has face to face contact with the&#xD;
                  subject for a minimum of approximately 10 hours (h) per week spread over 2 to 5 d&#xD;
                  during the week (e.g., 2 h per day for 5 d a week, or 5 h per day for 2 d a week)&#xD;
                  and is willing to accept responsibility for supervising the treatment (e.g.,&#xD;
                  administering study drug), accompanying the subject to clinic visits and&#xD;
                  assessing the condition of the subject throughout the study in accordance with&#xD;
                  all protocol requirements. The primary caregiver/study partner must be willing to&#xD;
                  sign the caregiver ICF.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  1. Has imaging consistent with other differential dementia diagnoses other than the&#xD;
             diagnosis of AD. For example, any suggestion of vascular disease including multiple&#xD;
             infarction involving large blood vessels or localized single infarction (angular&#xD;
             gyrus, thalamus, anterior cerebral artery, and posterior cerebral artery region),&#xD;
             multiple lacunae of the basal nuclei or white matter, or extensive lesions of the&#xD;
             periventricular white matter or combination of several lesions. Additionally, any&#xD;
             single lacunae in an area known to impact cognition, such as the hippocampus, will&#xD;
             also be exclusionary.&#xD;
&#xD;
             a. Should there be any evidence of neurologic symptoms between the date of the scan&#xD;
             confirming diagnosis and Screening (V1), rescanning is necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Has abnormal laboratory tests that suggest an alternate etiology for dementia, such&#xD;
             as history of uncorrected serum vitamin B12 deficiency, thyroid function abnormality,&#xD;
             severe anemia, electrolyte abnormality, or history of positive syphilis serology. In&#xD;
             these cases, the subject should be re evaluated to determine if these potential causes&#xD;
             of dementia have been addressed. Only if these causes have been ruled out as the cause&#xD;
             of the dementia, can the subject be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Diagnosis of type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes requiring insulin treatment.&#xD;
             Subjects who become insulin dependent during the study may not continue to participate&#xD;
             in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. History of epilepsy or seizure disorder requiring ongoing treatment, or any seizure&#xD;

&#xD;
               1. Alanine aminotransferase &gt;3 × upper limit of normal (ULN), aspartate&#xD;
                  aminotransferase &gt;3 × ULN, or history of clinically significant liver disease in&#xD;
                  the Investigator's medical judgment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Hemoglobin ≤10 g/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. International normalized ratio &gt;1.5 if not on anticoagulant medication; if the&#xD;
                  subject is on anticoagulant medication, the anticoagulant medication should be&#xD;
                  optimized and on a stable dose for ≥4 wk prior to Screening (V1).&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Creatinine clearance (Cockcroft Gault formula) of &lt;45 mL/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Known to be seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (1 and 2), hepatitis B,&#xD;
                  or hepatitis C. Subjects with hepatitis C who had spontaneous resolution or&#xD;
                  received successful curative treatment (e.g., HARVONI® [ledipasvir/sofosbuvir])&#xD;
                  with a documentation of undetectable viral load for at least 3 mo may be allowed.&#xD;
                  Serological testing will not be performed as part of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;

                  illness such as cancer requiring systemic therapy in the last 5 y, except for&#xD;
                  localized basal cell carcinoma of the skin, in situ cervical cancer successfully&#xD;
                  treated with surgical excision, and stable (for ≥90 d prior to Screening [V1])&#xD;
                  prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  8. History of severe heart failure (Grade 2 or higher on the New York Heart&#xD;
                  Association scale), major stroke, uncontrolled seizure disorder, or other medical&#xD;
                  illness that, in the Investigator's opinion, will increase the subject's risk of&#xD;
                  participation in the study or confound study assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  9. Any surgery requiring general anesthesia that is planned to occur during the&#xD;
                  study. Local anesthesia during outpatient surgery is permitted if, in the opinion&#xD;
                  of the Investigator, the operation will not interfere with study procedures and&#xD;
                  subject safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  10. History or current evidence of major psychiatric illness such as&#xD;
                  schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depressive disorder that may interfere&#xD;
                  with the subject's ability to perform the study and all assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
             a. Geriatric Depression Scale Short Form (GDS SF) score &gt;5 at Screening (V1). NOTE:&#xD;
             Mild depression or depressive mood arising in the context of AD are not criteria for&#xD;
             exclusion. The use of anti epileptic medication for non seizure related treatment or&#xD;
             the use of antidepressants is allowed if the dose has remained stable for ≥60 d prior&#xD;
             Screening (V1).&#xD;
&#xD;
             11. History of violent or aggressive behavior requiring medication or a formal program&#xD;
             of psychosocial intervention.&#xD;

             12. History of active suicidal thoughts (Type 4 or 5 on the C SSRS) in the 6 mo prior&#xD;
             to Screening (V1) or at Baseline (V2), history of a suicide attempt in the previous 2&#xD;
             y or &gt;1 lifetime suicide attempt, or are at serious suicide risk, in the&#xD;
             Investigator's clinical judgment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             13. History of alcohol or drug abuse or dependence within 24 mo of Screening (V1) as&#xD;
             defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5.&#xD;
