    <textblock>
      Food addiction is the concept that individuals can be &quot;addicted&quot; to foods, particularly&#xD;
      highly processed foods. This concept has attracted growing research interest given rising&#xD;
      obesity rates and the engineering of food products. Although food addiction is not a&#xD;
      recognized mental disorder, individuals do identify as being addicted to foods and self-help&#xD;
      organizations have existed since 1960 to purportedly treat it (i.e., through abstinence).&#xD;
      However, little research has been conducted on how abstinence approaches work. Such methods&#xD;
      may even be harmful given the risk of disordered eating. Currently, there are no empirically&#xD;
      supported treatments for food addiction. However, evidence-based treatments do exist for&#xD;
      addictions and eating disorders, such as motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioural&#xD;
      therapy, which may prove beneficial for food addiction, given neural similarities between&#xD;
      addictions and binge eating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study proposes a randomized controlled trial using a four-session adapted&#xD;
      motivational interviewing (AMI) and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) intervention for food&#xD;
      addiction. This intervention combines the personalized assessment feedback and person-centred&#xD;
      counseling of AMI with CBT skills for eating disorders, such as self-monitoring of food&#xD;
      intake. The aim is to motivate participants to enact behavioural change, such as reduced and&#xD;
      moderate consumption of processed foods. Outcome measures will assess food addiction and&#xD;
      binge eating symptoms, self-reported consumption of processed foods, readiness for change,&#xD;
      eating self-efficacy, and other constructs such as emotional eating. The intervention&#xD;
      condition will be compared to a waitlist control group. Both groups will be assessed at pre-&#xD;
      and postintervention periods, as well as over a 3-month follow-up period to assess&#xD;
      maintenance effects. Based on a power analysis and previous effect sizes following AMI&#xD;
      interventions for binge eating, a total sample size of n = 58 is needed. A total of 131&#xD;
      individuals will be recruited to account for previous exclusion and withdrawal rates.&#xD;
      Participation is estimated to take place from March 2021 to March 2022. All intervention&#xD;
      sessions will be conducted virtually over secure videoconferencing technology or telephone,&#xD;
      expanding access to all adult community members across Ontario, Canada. Twenty randomly&#xD;
      selected session tapes will be reviewed for MI adherence.&#xD;

      Background: Food addiction is the concept that individuals can be &quot;addicted&quot; to foods,&#xD;
      particularly highly processed foods. This concept has attracted growing research interest&#xD;
      given rising obesity rates and engineering of food products in industrialized countries. Food&#xD;
      addiction is assessed using the validated Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS), which applies&#xD;
      substance use disorder criteria from the most recent Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of&#xD;
      Mental Disorders to the consumption of these types of foods. Prevalence estimates of food&#xD;
      addiction range from 8-15% in two nationally representative samples in the U.S. and Germany.&#xD;
      Although food addiction is not a currently recognized mental disorder, individuals do&#xD;
      identify as being addicted to foods and self-help organizations such as Overeaters Anonymous&#xD;
      have existed since 1960 to purportedly treat it (i.e., through abstinence). However, little&#xD;
      research has been conducted on how abstinence approaches work and such methods may even be&#xD;
      harmful for individuals with eating concerns, given the risk of disordered eating. Currently,&#xD;
      there are no empirically supported treatments for food addiction. However, evidence-based&#xD;
      treatments do exist for addictions and eating disorders, such as Adapted Motivational&#xD;
      Interviewing (AMI) and Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), which may prove beneficial for&#xD;
      food addiction, given neural similarities between substance addiction and binge eating, and&#xD;
      the potential for high ambivalence. AMI is designed to allow clients to voice their own&#xD;
      motivations for change and the use of AMI skills by therapists has been shown in&#xD;
      meta-analyses to predict this type of change talk, which then predicts positive behavioural&#xD;
      outcomes, Given that food addiction is also associated with internalized weight bias and&#xD;
      lower eating self-efficacy, AMI techniques in fostering acceptance, highlighting client&#xD;
      strengths, and providing psychoeducation may help to lower self-blame and bolster confidence&#xD;
      to change one's eating habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: The current study proposes a randomized controlled trial using a four-session AMI and&#xD;
      CBT intervention for food addiction. Due to COVID-19 limitations, all intervention sessions&#xD;
      will be conducted virtually over secure videoconferencing technology or by telephone,&#xD;
      expanding access to all adult community members across the province of Ontario in Canada. The&#xD;
      intervention combines the personalized assessment feedback and person-centred counselling of&#xD;
      AMI with CBT skills for eating disorders, such as self-monitoring of food intake and stimulus&#xD;
      control. The aim is to motivate participants to enact behavioural change, such as moderate&#xD;
      consumption of processed foods in a harm reduction approach. Twenty randomly selected session&#xD;
      tapes will be reviewed by two trained coders to assess for MI adherence using the most&#xD;
      commonly used MI fidelity measure. The intervention condition will be compared to a wait-list&#xD;
      control (WLC) group. Both groups will be assessed at pre- and postintervention periods, as&#xD;
      well as over a 3-month follow-up period to assess maintenance effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypotheses - Food Addiction and Binge Eating Frequency (H1-H3)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H1: Compared to WLC, AMI will lead to a significantly greater reduction in food&#xD;
           addiction symptoms (using the YFAS 2.0) at postintervention and up to 3 months&#xD;
           postintervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H2: Compared to WLC, AMI will lead to a significantly greater reduction in self-reported&#xD;
           consumption of highly processed foods specified in the YFAS 2.0 (using the Canadian Diet&#xD;
           History Questionnaire II) at postintervention and up to 3 months postintervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H3: Compared to WLC, AMI will lead a to significantly greater reduction in number of&#xD;
           binge eating episodes (using select Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire questions)&#xD;
           at postintervention and up to 3 months postintervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Hypotheses - Readiness for Change, Eating Self-Efficacy, and Weight Bias&#xD;
      Internalization (H4-H6)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H4: Compared to WLC, AMI will lead to a greater increase in motivation for changing&#xD;
           one's food addiction symptoms (e.g., reducing consumption of highly processed foods;&#xD;
           using Motivational Rulers) at postintervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H5: Compared to WLC, AMI will lead to a significantly greater increase in eating&#xD;
           self-efficacy (using the Weight Efficacy Lifestyle Questionnaire) at postintervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H6: Compared to WLC, AMI will lead to a greater reduction in weight bias internalization&#xD;
           (using the Modified Weight Bias Internalization Scale) at postintervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Hypotheses - Other Eating-Related Constructs (H7-H14)&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that AMI will lead to significantly greater reductions in other&#xD;
      eating-related constructs compared to WLC at postintervention and up to 3 months&#xD;
      postintervention, in terms of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H7: self-identified food addiction,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H8: addiction-like eating behaviour (AEBS),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H9: binge eating symptoms (Binge Eating Scale),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H10: loss-of-control eating (Loss of Control over Eating Scale),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H11: emotional eating (Emotional Eating Scale),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H12: general appetite for palatable foods or hedonic hunger (Power of Food Scale),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H13: cravings for specific highly processed foods (Food Craving Inventory),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H14: Body Mass Index (BMI)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tertiary Hypothesis - Working Alliance (H15-17)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given that a collaborative partnership is key component of MI and that there is a robust&#xD;
      positive association between working alliance and treatment outcomes, it is hypothesized that&#xD;
      there will be positive associations between postintervention working alliance (using the&#xD;
      Working Alliance Scale Short Form Revised) and postintervention motivation for change (H15),&#xD;
      eating self-efficacy (H16), and weight bias internalization (H17).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: Based on a power analysis and previous effect sizes following AMI interventions&#xD;
      for binge eating (Cohen's d = 0.76), a total sample size of n = 58 is needed. Accounting for&#xD;
      previous withdrawal rates and an inclusion rate of 44.6% in a similar study, a total of 131&#xD;
      individuals should be recruited. Recruitment is estimated to take place over 5 months&#xD;
      beginning in March 2021. Given the 3-month follow-up, participation is estimated to end in&#xD;
      March 2022.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses: To determine whether both AMI and WLC groups are equivalent in terms of sample&#xD;
      characteristics as a result of randomization, independent samples t tests will be conducted&#xD;
      on baseline variables such as age, BMI, YFAS severity, and binge eating frequency. To&#xD;
      determine whether sample characteristics differ between treatment completers and dropouts,&#xD;
      independent samples t tests will be conducted on the same baseline variables and working&#xD;
      alliance. Lastly, to determine if equal proportions dropped out of the AMI and WLC groups, a&#xD;
      chi square test will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Outcomes: For the primary outcomes (i.e., YFAS symptoms,&#xD;
      binge eating frequency, and consumption of highly processed foods), given the between-groups&#xD;
      and repeated-measures mixed design, a 2 (group: WLC vs. AMI) x 4 (time: baseline,&#xD;
      postintervention, and 1- and-, 3-month follow-up) mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be&#xD;
      conducted on SPSS statistical software. For the secondary outcomes (i.e., readiness for&#xD;
      change, eating self-efficacy, and weight bias internalization), a 2 (group: WLC vs. AMI) x 2&#xD;
      (time: baseline, postintervention) mixed ANOVA will be used to compare the WLC and AMI groups&#xD;
      from pre- to postintervention. For the other secondary eating-related outcomes, the same 2&#xD;
      (group) x 4 (time) mixed ANOVAs described above will be used to compare WLC and AMI groups&#xD;
      across time. For the tertiary outcomes, to determine if there is a positive association&#xD;
      between working alliance and readiness for change, eating self-efficacy, and weight bias&#xD;
      internalization, two-tailed, bivariate, Pearson's correlation analyses will be performed. To&#xD;
      explore the changes in readiness for change, eating self-efficacy, weight bias&#xD;
      internalization, and working alliance from pre- to postintervention, paired samples t tests&#xD;
      will be used for the AMI group for these four constructs. Prior to data analyses, data will&#xD;
      be checked for bias and corrected as necessary. Any interactions from the ANOVAs will be&#xD;
      followed up with planned contrasts, with the control group and baseline as the base&#xD;
      categories for the between-groups and repeated-measures variables, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming that there are no valid reasons to ignore missing data and to conduct complete case&#xD;
      analysis (e.g., if less than 5% of data are missing), and assuming that data are missing at&#xD;
      random, multiple imputation will be conducted on SPSS for the missing values, with at least&#xD;
      50 imputed datasets in order to reduce sampling variability in the imputation process.&#xD;
      Results from complete case analyses and multiple imputation analyses will be compared for&#xD;
      differences. To reduce bias of the imputation model, the model will include any variables&#xD;
      that predict missing data. SPSS will automatically scan the data for a monotone pattern of&#xD;
      missing values, and if such a pattern is present, a monotonic multiple imputation will be&#xD;
      conducted. The default number of iterations per missing variable used will be 10 but at least&#xD;
      50 imputed datasets will be computed. If data are not assumed to be missing at random,&#xD;
      sensitivity analyses will be performed for missing binary data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Satisfaction Evaluation: Descriptive statistics will be obtained for the three quantitative&#xD;
      satisfaction questions (e.g., an average score for how satisfied participants were with the&#xD;
      research study). Qualitative responses from the open-ended questions will be analysed as per&#xD;
      thematic analysis methodology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Adherence: The minimum threshold of MI adherence will be based on the Motivational&#xD;
      Interviewing Treatment Integrity Code (MITI) basic competence and proficiency thresholds for&#xD;
      clinicians. Specifically, summary scores must fall in at least the &quot;fair&quot; scores (i.e., the&#xD;
      Relational score must be 3.5/5, the Technical score must be 3/5, 40% of the reflections must&#xD;
      be complex reflections, and the reflection-to-question ratio must be 1:1). If all four&#xD;
      domains meet these thresholds, then the session will be rated as 100% fairly adherent, which&#xD;
      will be the minimum goal. An average percentage of &quot;fair&quot; adherence across raters and tapes&#xD;
      will be calculated to determine if sessions met this threshold. To determine interrater&#xD;
      reliability for each summary score, a two-way mixed-effects model, using the mean of two&#xD;
      raters (k = 2) and absolute agreement will be used. Intraclass correlation coefficients and&#xD;
      their 95% confidence intervals will be reported from the SPSS output.&#xD;
