  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The lifetime prevalence of Bipolar II is 0.4% with the time spent with depressive symptoms&#xD;
      outnumbering the time spent with hypomanic symptoms by 35 to 1. Regarding current treatment&#xD;
      options, psychotherapy is effective for managing depressive symptoms, with CBT being&#xD;
      particularly efficacious. Unfortunately, CBT is often not a feasible treatment option.&#xD;
      Electronic CBT (e-CBT) is more accessible for treating various mental illnesses with evidence&#xD;
      suggesting it can increase treatment adherence and patient satisfaction. Moreover, e-CBT is&#xD;
      suggested to have comparable outcomes to in-person CBT in the treatment of depression and&#xD;
      anxiety. Typically, patient-clinician interactions of e-CBT are administered through email&#xD;
      however, this is an insecure, unsustainable, and non-scalable treatment delivery method. The&#xD;
      proposed study will use the Online Psychotherapy Tool (OPTT), a secure cloud-based platform&#xD;
      for the delivery of e-CBT. The aim is to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of using&#xD;
      OPTT for the treatment of BAD-II with depressive symptoms, while also analyzing social,&#xD;
      cultural, and personal factors affecting patients' experience. Participants (n = 80)&#xD;
      diagnosed with BAD-II in a depressive episode will be recruited from the Mood and Anxiety&#xD;
      Clinic at Providence Care Hospital in Kingston, Ontario, Canada. Eligible participants will&#xD;
      then be randomly assigned to either the treatment group (e-CBT plus treatment as usual (TAU))&#xD;
      (n = 40) or the control group (TAU) (n = 40) where they will complete the 12-week program.&#xD;
      Participants in the TAU group will be offered the e-CBT program after the first 12 weeks if&#xD;
      they wish to take part. Participants in the e-CBT group will complete weekly modules&#xD;
      mirroring in-person CBT content and complete homework assignments that will be evaluated by a&#xD;
      clinician who will provide personalized feedback through OPTT. Progression/regression of&#xD;
      participants will be analyzed using the MADRS, YMRS, and CGI-BP-M questionnaires administered&#xD;
      at baseline, after week 6, and after week 12. Personal, social, and cultural factors&#xD;
      impacting participant experience will be investigated through an in-depth interview utilizing&#xD;
      focus groups. The findings from this study will be the first on the effectiveness of&#xD;
      delivering e-CBT to patients with BAD-II with residual depressive symptoms. This approach can&#xD;
      provide an innovative method to address the barriers associated with in-person psychotherapy.&#xD;

      Population: Individuals (n = 80) diagnosed with BAD-II who are experiencing an acute&#xD;
      depressive episode will be recruited from the Mood and Anxiety Clinic at Providence Care&#xD;
      Hospital (PCH) in Kingston, Ontario, Canada. Inclusion criteria include being between 18 and&#xD;
      55 years of age at the start of the study, a confirmed diagnosis of BAD-II according to&#xD;
      Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5), a&#xD;
      Montgomery Ã…sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score between 7 and 34, competence to&#xD;
      consent and participate, the ability to speak and read English, and having consistent and&#xD;
      reliable access to the internet. Exclusion criteria include experiencing a current acute&#xD;
      hypomanic/manic episode, acute psychosis, severe alcohol or substance use disorder, and&#xD;
      active suicidal and/or homicidal ideation. Additionally, if an individual is currently&#xD;
      receiving or has received CBT in the past year they will be excluded from the study. To&#xD;
      confirm eligibility, participants will undergo a complete assessment from a clinician where&#xD;
      the diagnosis will be confirmed using the DSM-5 and a Mini-International National Interview&#xD;
      (MINI) version 7.0.2. Eligible participants will be randomly allocated into either the e-CBT&#xD;
      plus treatment as usual (TAU) (n = 40) or the control group (TAU exclusively) (n = 40).&#xD;
      Participants in the control group will be offered the e-CBT program after the first 12 weeks&#xD;
      of the study if they are interested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure: Upon completion of the initial assessment, if eligible for the study, participants&#xD;
      from the e-CBT group will be enrolled in the e-CBT program. All e-CBT sessions will be&#xD;
      administered through OPTT and will consist of approximately 30 slides per week. The content&#xD;
      and format of each weekly online session will be designed to mirror in-person CBT for the&#xD;
      treatment of BAD-II. Participants will complete the module and submit the assigned homework&#xD;
      to their clinician through OPTT where the clinician will be able to provide personalized&#xD;
      feedback. These pre-designed engaging and multimedia modules will be able to streamline the&#xD;
      therapy process, helping care providers save time on repeating similar materials to all&#xD;
      patients and focusing on delivering personalized feedback to each patient. The slides will&#xD;
      highlight a different topic each week and include general information, an overview of skills,&#xD;
      and homework that is to be completed within that week. All weekly sessions have an estimated&#xD;
      completion time of 50 minutes. During the 12 weeks, both groups will continue with their TAU.&#xD;
      To ensure the quality and consistency of care, care pathways will be fully assigned&#xD;
      beforehand, and a clinician will be trained to follow the standard care pathways. Through the&#xD;
      training, the clinician will learn the aim and content of each therapeutic session and will&#xD;
      be provided with sample homework submissions and modules to better understand how to&#xD;
      structure feedback.&#xD;
