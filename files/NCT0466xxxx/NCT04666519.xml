    <textblock>
      Prior studies investigating the etiopathogenesis of surgical site infection (SSI)&#xD;
      traditionally suggested three main ways for the infection to occur: local contamination&#xD;
      occurring during the surgery, hematogenous translocation of bacteria during concomitant&#xD;
      bacteraemia, and contamination from adjacent infected tissues by the progression of the&#xD;
      infective process. While most of the research on SSI focused on minimizing any source of&#xD;
      pathogens at the time of the surgery, emerging evidence shows how acute and chronic SSI can&#xD;
      emerge more often from bacteraemia or other tissues in the body, such as the gastrointestinal&#xD;
      system, especially when dysbiosis and high permeability are retrieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intercellular tight junctions (TJs) tightly regulate paracellular antigen trafficking. TJs&#xD;
      are extremely dynamic structures that operate in several critical functions of the intestinal&#xD;
      epithelium under both physiological and pathological circumstances. This paradigm was&#xD;
      subverted in 1993 by the discovery of zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1) as the first component of the&#xD;
      TJ complex 11 now being comprised of more than 150 proteins, including occludin, claudins,&#xD;
      junctional adhesion molecules (JAMs), tricellulin , and angulins . However, despite major&#xD;
      progress in our knowledge on the composition and function of the intercellular TJ, the&#xD;
      mechanisms by which they are regulated are still incompletely understood. One of the&#xD;
      breakthroughs in understanding the role of gut permeability in health and disease has been&#xD;
      the discovery of zonulin, and the only physiologic intestinal permeability modulator&#xD;
      described so far.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since then, zonulin has been used as a marker for increased intestinal permeability and&#xD;
      associated with soluble CD14 (sCD14) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), other common markers&#xD;
      associated with surgical complication, inflammation, and bacterial translocations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As such, Zonulin could be a biomarker for mid- and long-term complications after total joint&#xD;
      replacement such as infection, loosening, and mechanical complications associated with&#xD;
      painful symptomatology.&#xD;
