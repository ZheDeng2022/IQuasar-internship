      The proposed trial design has been developed to assess the consistency and reproducibility of&#xD;
      two consecutive direct skin feeding assays (DSFA) at 24-hour interval. The results will&#xD;
      determine the type of pivotal trial design for a follow-on Phase 2b trial whose objective is&#xD;
      to bridge the standard membrane feeding assay (SMFA) to the direct skin feeding assay (DSFA)&#xD;
      and direct membrane feeding assay (DMFA) using a monoclonal antibody intervention, TB31F mAb,&#xD;
      which interrupts transmission from human to mosquito. The results from this experimental&#xD;
      medicine study will inform whether the preferred &quot;Before-After&quot; trial design in which each&#xD;
      human volunteer serves as their own internal control can be utilized for a follow-on Phase 2b&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;

      Sera collected will be assayed in membrane feeding assay (risk mitigation) only if&#xD;
      gametocyte-positive subject fails to transmit any parasites to mosquitoes in either the DSFA&#xD;
      or DMFA performed either on day 1 or day 2. Sera will be destroyed before study close-out.&#xD;

        The target sample size for subjects with gametocytemia is approximately 45 individuals.&#xD;
        Approximately 180 participants will be screened for gametocyte carriage by PCR to achieve&#xD;
        the target sample size. Screening of subjects will continue until the desired sample size&#xD;
        of gametocytemic individuals who undergo all study procedures is attained. Adults aged 18 -&#xD;
        55 years will be recruited from the villages in the Kombewa Health and Demographics&#xD;
        Surveillance System (HDSS) consisting of half of Kisumu&#xD;

             prevent pregnancy for 30 days after receiving Coartem and primaquine. Non-childbearing&#xD;
             potential means she is surgically sterilized or at least one year post-menopausal.&#xD;

             participant or the partner.&#xD;
&#xD;

             swelling)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant (i.e. a positive pregnancy test)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current or recent (within the preceding 2 weeks) use of antimalarial treatment&#xD;
