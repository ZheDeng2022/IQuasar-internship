    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter, non randomized, single arm, open clinical trial. The selected&#xD;
      disease was relapsed / refractory NHL, and the disease was classified into highly aggressive&#xD;
      lymphoma, invasive lymphoma and inert lymphoma; Highly invasive NHL included Burkitt lymphoma&#xD;
      (BL), lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL), high-grade B-cell lymphoma, etc; Invasive NHL includes&#xD;
      diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma and peripheral T-cell lymphoma; Inert NHL&#xD;
      contains follicular lymphoma, small lymphocytic lymphoma and marginal zone lymphoma.&#xD;

      A single car consists of scFv, hinge region, transmembrane region, costimulatory domain and&#xD;
      zeta subunit of CD3.Prior to CAR-T cell infusion, the patients will be subjected to&#xD;
      preconditioning treatment. After CAR-T cell infusion, the patients will be evaluated for&#xD;
      adverse reactions and efficacy.&#xD;
