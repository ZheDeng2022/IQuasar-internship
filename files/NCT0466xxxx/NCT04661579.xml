  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed trial design has been developed to answer several questions related to the&#xD;
      nature of RTS,S vaccine efficacy in African adults that may be influenced by concurrent&#xD;
      and/or past P. falciparum infection leading to a state of immunologic hypo-responsiveness.&#xD;
      The proposed study design encompasses five groups. Three groups (Groups 1, 2, and 3) will be&#xD;
      administered RTS,S/AS01E on a 0, 1, 7 month schedule with Dose 3 delivered as a 1/5th&#xD;
      fractional dose. Two groups (Groups 4 and 5) will be administered a comparator vaccine on a&#xD;
      0, 1, 7 month schedule.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PATH and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) are committed to developing a malaria vaccine to help reduce&#xD;
      the burden of malaria disease in children and contribute to malaria elimination. GSK has&#xD;
      developed a candidate vaccine against malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum, RTS,S/AS01E.&#xD;
      The vaccine has been shown to be safe in multiple trials and efficacy data in pediatric&#xD;
      populations has led to a pilot implementation program in three African countries including&#xD;
      Kenya. The RTS,S/AS01E vaccine mechanism of action is presumed to work on the initial&#xD;
      sporozoite and liver stages of P. falciparum infection through neutralization of the&#xD;
      circumsporozoite (CS) antigen on parasites invading after a mosquito bite in individuals&#xD;
      immunized with the RTS,S/AS01E vaccine. In order to inform whether a vaccine such as&#xD;
      RTS,S/AS01E may have a future role in malaria elimination, it will be important to establish&#xD;
      vaccine efficacy in adults in Sub-Saharan Africa who are reservoirs of parasites and who&#xD;
      contribute to ongoing malaria transmission. However, in previous trials, the vaccine has been&#xD;
      less effective in adults in endemic regions compared to challenge studies. While the cause of&#xD;
      this is likely multi-factorial, there is a degree of immunologic hypo-responsiveness that&#xD;
      occurs in endemic regions that may impede the development of a protective immune response&#xD;
      following immunization that is presumed to be related to chronic infection. This study&#xD;
      postulates that treatment of infection prior to immunization can reset the immune response&#xD;
      leading to an improved vaccine efficacy. To evaluate this hypothesis, the study will recruit&#xD;
      5 groups. Groups 1 and 4 will have asymptomatic infection with P. falciparum as measured by a&#xD;
      highly sensitive PCR assay (planned assay is an RNA-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR)&#xD;
      though the backup utilizes both RNA and DNA PCR, see protocol for details) and will be&#xD;
      treated with antimalarial medications prior to immunization with RTS,S/AS01E or the&#xD;
      comparator rabies vaccine, respectively, with the primary objective of evaluating the vaccine&#xD;
      efficacy of RTS,S/AS01E relative to the rabies vaccine in this context. Groups 2 and 5 will&#xD;
      be negative for asymptomatic infection with P. falciparum as measured by a highly sensitive&#xD;
      PCR assay and will be treated with antimalarial medications prior to immunization with&#xD;
      RTS,S/AS01E or the comparator rabies vaccine, respectively, with the secondary objective of&#xD;
      evaluating the vaccine efficacy of RTS,S/AS01 relative to the rabies vaccine in this context.&#xD;
      Group 3 will have asymptomatic infection with P. falciparum as measured by a highly sensitive&#xD;
      PCR assay but will not be treated with antimalarial medications prior to immunization with&#xD;
      the RTS,S/AS01E vaccine; the immunological profile (including anti-CS and cell-mediated&#xD;
      immune responses) of this group and groups 1 and 2 will be evaluated as part of secondary and&#xD;
      exploratory objectives. Other secondary objectives include safety assessments and other&#xD;
      exploratory objectives defined in this protocol. A total of 619 subjects will be enrolled&#xD;
      (164 in groups 1 and 4, 128 in groups 2 and 5, and 35 in group 3) over a period of 6 months&#xD;
      and will participate in the study for an initial immunization period (vaccine given on 0, 1,&#xD;
      and 7 month schedule with the final dose being 1/5 of the dose of the first two&#xD;
      immunizations) followed by 6-12 months of follow-up (varying based on the number of events),&#xD;
      with the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints of time to first malaria infection by PCR.&#xD;
      Total duration expected to be 20.5-26.5 months. Those groups receiving antimalarial&#xD;
      medications (1, 2, 3, 4) will receive either dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine or&#xD;
      artemether/lumefantrine and low-dose primaquine as described in the protocol.&#xD;

Anti-malarial treatment with Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA/Pip) to clear asexual stage and young gametocyte parasites plus low dose primaquine (LD PQ) to clear mature gametocytes will be given 4 weeks prior to immunization with RTS,S/AS01E. A 2nd course of DHA/Pip plus Primaquine will be given 2 weeks before second RTS,S/AS01E immunization. One week before 3rd RTS,S/AS01E immunization, a three-day course of Artemether/lumefantrine (A/L) plus Primaquine will be administered to clear infection. Rationale for administration of A/L is its preferred shortened half-life allowing for evaluation of vaccine efficacy thereby excluding any confounder effect due to prolonged anti-malarial effect of drug.</description>

             respiratory infection without fever, i.e. Oral temperature &lt; 37.5°C*. Individuals&#xD;
             excluded with acute disease, including acute malaria, can become eligible again after&#xD;
             complete recovery of the illness, including appropriate treatment as applicable, and&#xD;

             either using either oral, axillary, or infrared thermal thermometers during clinic or&#xD;
             field visits, while subjects enrolled in the reactogenicity cohort will be supplied&#xD;

          -  Pregnant (i.e. a positive pregnancy test) or lactating female during immunization&#xD;
             phase of the study (refer to section 2.3 for rationale). If a woman becomes pregnant&#xD;
