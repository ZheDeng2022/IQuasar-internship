      This study is a randomized, open-label, positive control, multicenter, phase Ⅲ study to&#xD;
      compare the efficacy and safety of Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Liposome Injection with&#xD;
      Chidamide in patients with relapsed/refractory Peripheral T Cell Lymphoma (PTCL). The&#xD;
      eligible patients will be randomly assigned to the experimental and control groups in a 1:1&#xD;
      ratio. The patients in experimental group will receive Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Liposome&#xD;
      Injection (20 mg/m2) once every 28 days for a maximum of 6-8 cycles. Patients in the control&#xD;
      group will be treated with Chidamide (30 mg) twice per week with 3-day intervals until&#xD;
      disease progression. Patients in the control group who had confirmed disease progression will&#xD;
      have the option to switch to the liposomal mitoxantrone hydrochloride treatment. Patients&#xD;
      will receive treatment until the completion of 6-8 cycles of treatment (this applies only to&#xD;
      the experiment group), disease progression, intolerable toxicity, death, loss to follow-up,&#xD;
      withdrawal (patient's decision or investigator's decision), whichever comes first. All&#xD;
      patients will have post-treatment follow-up for disease status until disease&#xD;
      progression/recurrence, initiation of new antitumor therapy, or being lost to follow-up.&#xD;
