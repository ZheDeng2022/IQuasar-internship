  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to assess the impact of a nursing intervention on therapeutic&#xD;
      adherence in elderly patients after acute myocardial infarction compared to a control group&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A comprehensive geriatric assessment was performed during the first admission in all&#xD;
      patients. Patients were randomly allocated to a nursing intervention group or a usual care&#xD;
      group. In patients from the intervention group, a nursing intervention programme was&#xD;
      performed 3 months after admission, based on education, support and patient monitoring to&#xD;
      improve therapeutic adherence and a 6 month phone call. The main outcome measured was&#xD;
      therapeutic adherence at 12 months, as defined by a combination of adherence measurement&#xD;
      tools (Morisky-Green and Hayness-Sacket scales, attendance at visits and withdrawal of&#xD;
      medication from the pharmacy). Therapeutic adherence was assessed by nurses blinded to the&#xD;
      assignment group.&#xD;

    <masking>Triple (Care Provider, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>The random assignment was made to the &quot;nursing intervention group&quot; and the &quot;usual care group&quot;, generating a list using the EPIDAT Â® programme. This list contained the patient number and the assignment group. The randomization procedure was performed during hospitalization for AMI. The researcher did not know the assignment list, calling the research unit at the time of each patient inclusion by phone, when they were told to which group they would belong to once the first interview was over.&#xD;
The main outcome measured was therapeutic adherence 12 months after admission. This assessment was performed by trained nurses blinded to the group assignment.</masking_description>

    <time_frame>12 months after admission</time_frame>
    <description>The main outcome measured was therapeutic adherence 12 months after admission. The definition of adherence was a single measure taking into account 4 different methods (see below). Patients were considered adherent when the 4 criteria were present (called &quot;global adherence&quot;).Measurement unit was: Number of patients with therapeutic adherence&#xD;
Morisky-Green Scale (MGLS): consists of a series of four questions with dichotomous answers (yes/no) that affect the patient's behaviour regarding compliance.&#xD;
Self-reported compliance communication: Haynes-Sackett method: involves asking the patient one question. If the answer is affirmative, is considered adherent.&#xD;
Records of dispensations in the pharmacy: Patients who withdrew all medications during the year were considered adherent.&#xD;
Attendance at scheduled appointments: It is recorded if the patient has missed any of the control visits by both the doctor and the nurse during the first year.</description>

    <description>An educational interview by trained nurses was performed at three months in patients allocated to the intervention group. The visit was carried out at the hospital. Family and caregivers were also asked to attend this visit for instruction. For patients unable to move, the nursing team went to their home to perform the intervention, or it was conducted by phone. The duration of this interview was approximately 40 minutes and was focused on some measures and recommendations to improve or maintain adherence. Then, there is a reminder call at 6 months.</description>
