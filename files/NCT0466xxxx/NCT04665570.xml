  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study drug, fixed dose combination of acarbose and metformin, have already been approved&#xD;
      to take together as a treatment for type 2 diabetes (T2D). Sometimes, researchers continue&#xD;
      studying a treatment after it has been approved to learn more about how doctors decide which&#xD;
      treatment to give to patients. In this study, the researchers want to learn more about how&#xD;
      acarbose and metformin work when taken together and if the patients have any medical&#xD;
      problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include patients with T2D that was diagnosed in the last 3 to 6 months. These&#xD;
      patients will also have recently started treatment with acarbose and metformin. The study&#xD;
      will include about 2,000 men and women in India who are at least 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the patients will take fixed dose combination of acarbose and metformin tablets based&#xD;
      on their doctor's instructions. They will then visit their study site 4 times over 6 months.&#xD;
      At these visits, their doctors will ask them questions about how they are feeling and what&#xD;
      medications they are taking. If require, the doctors will take blood samples to measure the&#xD;
      patients' blood sugar levels as per routine practice. The doctors will also do physical&#xD;
      examinations and check the patients' overall health.&#xD;
