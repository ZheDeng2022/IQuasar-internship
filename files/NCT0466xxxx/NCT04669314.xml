      Operations performed for liver hemangioma at Ankara University Hospitals will be&#xD;
      retrospectively analyzed. Patient and disease characteristics including demographics,&#xD;
      laboratory tests, imaging studies, type of surgical approach and outcomes including&#xD;
      postoperative laboratory tests, record of complications, duration of hospital stay will be&#xD;
      reviewed. Complications were classified according to Clavien-Dindo classification. The&#xD;
      patients were informed about the surgeries in advance and their informed consents about&#xD;
      surgeries and data collection for scientific purposes were obtained. Datafile will be&#xD;
      anonymized before analysis and original file will be destroyed. Outcomes such as&#xD;
      complications, hospital stay, blood transfusion and mortality will be compared between groups&#xD;
      created according to type of surgery, lesion size, preoperative laboratory values and&#xD;
      demographic features. Variables for prediction of better outcomes are expected to be&#xD;
      discovered.&#xD;

    <description>Complications after surgery for hemangioma will be collected from records and and will be classified according to 'The Clavien-Dindo Classification of Surgical Complications'. The classification grades are ranging between Grade 1(better) which indicates minor deviation from normal postoperative course and Grade 5 (worst) which means death as a complication.</description>
