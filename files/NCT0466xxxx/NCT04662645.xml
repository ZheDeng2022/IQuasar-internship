      This trial studies how well embedded palliative care works in managing symptoms in&#xD;
      participants with stage III-IV thoracic malignancies that has come back and their caregivers.&#xD;
      Embedded palliative care may improve distress and anxiety in participants and caregivers.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine feasibility of embedding a palliative care (PC) physician within the James&#xD;
      Thoracic Oncology Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess patient and caregiver outcomes over a 12-month period within an embedded&#xD;
      onco-palliative care clinic model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate and describe clinician attitudes and beliefs regarding utilization of&#xD;
      embedded palliative care as well as symptoms of provider burnout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To analyze health care utilization among participants receiving embedded onco-palliative&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants and caregivers undergo embedded palliative care comprising symptom management&#xD;
      (physical and psychological), advanced directives and goals of care discussion, caregiver&#xD;
      support, and referral for adjunctive supportive services as needed at each clinic visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed for up to 1 year.&#xD;
