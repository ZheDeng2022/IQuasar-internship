  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of one 25 mg dose of&#xD;
      psilocybin in participants with anorexia nervosa based on adverse events (AEs), changes in&#xD;
      vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs) and clinical laboratory tests. The secondary&#xD;
      objectives are to explore the efficacy of a single 25 mg dose of psilocybin on eating&#xD;
      disorder symptoms and behaviors, body image, anxiety, food related obsessions and rituals,&#xD;
      and body weight.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Because there are no proven treatments that normalize core symptoms in adult anorexia&#xD;
      nervosa, a disorder with high chronicity, many individuals seek out alternative approaches to&#xD;
      care. Recent evidence has suggested that anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder, and&#xD;
      diminished reward or motivation play key roles in the development and maintenance of&#xD;
      dysfunctional eating, and poor outcome. In recent years, a growing number of studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated the safety and preliminary efficacy of psilocybin in clinical trials for a range&#xD;
      of psychiatric illnesses including treatment resistant depression, obsessive compulsive&#xD;
      disorder, addiction, and anxiety. Psilocybin may represent a promising new treatment for&#xD;
      anorexia nervosa. However, no studies have tested psilocybin in this eating disorder&#xD;
      population. Accordingly, this study aims to establish the safety, tolerability and dosing of&#xD;
      psilocybin in adult patients with anorexia nervosa, as well as gather pilot data on possible&#xD;
      efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, the investigators will recruit adults who currently have a DSM-V diagnosis of&#xD;
      anorexia nervosa. Participants will undergo medical and psychological screening and those who&#xD;
      are deemed eligible will partake in a maximum of 7 study visits, lasting from 4-8 weeks. On&#xD;
      dosing day, participants will receive a single 25 mg dose of psilocybin along with&#xD;
      psychotherapeutic support, which includes preparation and integration sessions surrounding&#xD;
      the experience. There will be a follow-up period of one month following the psilocybin&#xD;
      session during which a range of psychological measures (questionnaires and interviews) will&#xD;
      be collected.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline to Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>The EDE is a structured clinical interview (investigator rated) and is used to measure the severity of the characteristic psychopathology of eating disorders. The four EDE subscales (Dietary Restraint, Eating Concern, Weight Concern, and Shape Concern) are rated on a 7-point forced-choice format (0-6), with higher scores reflecting greater severity or frequency.</description>

    <description>The PASTAS is a self-reported 16-item measure that assesses anxiety about physical appearance. Each question is rated on a Likert scale from 0 to 4, indicating that the individual feels anxious, tense or nervous about a specific body part or general overweightness. There is a minimum score on each scale 0 and a maximum score of 64, where higher scores indicated greater severity in anxiety.</description>

The six items are: 1) dissatisfaction with physical appearance, 2) dissatisfaction with body size and shape, 3) dissatisfaction with weight, 4) feelings of physical unattractiveness, 5) current feeling about one's look relative to how one usually feels, and 6) evaluation of one's appearance relative to how the average person looks. Each item is evaluated on a 9-point bipolar Likert like scale and higher scores indicate more positive body image.</description>

    <description>This self-report scale consists of 65 items and 19 question items related to eating disorder preoccupations and rituals. There is an emphasis on comparison between current state (last two weeks) and worst state, the one month where the participant believed their eating disorder to be the most severe. The scoring includes a preoccupations subtotal, rituals subtotal and total score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI) total score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Day 1, Day 7, and Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>The EDI is a self-report questionnaire. It consists of 91 items organized into 12 primary scales rated on a 0-4 point scoring system, consisting of 3 eating disorder specific scales and 9 general psychological scales that are highly relevant to, but not specific to, eating disorders. It yields six composite scores: one that is eating disorder specific (i.e., Eating Disorder Risk) and five that are general integrative psychological constructs (i.e., Ineffectiveness, Interpersonal Problems, Affective Problems, Overcontrol, General Psychological Maladjustment). A computer-based scoring program generates a detailed clinical profile and scoring report for each participant.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to Day 1, Day 7, and Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>The EDE-QS is a self-report questionnaire. It consists of 32 items that assess the core symptoms of eating disorders and range of eating-related psychopathology. The EDE-QS is based closely on the EDE interview. Scores range from 0 to 36 and higher scores indicate greater eating disorder symptoms.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS) total score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Day 1, Day 7, and Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>The QIDS is a self-reported scale. Total QIDS scores range from 0 to 27, with scores of 5 or lower indicative of no depression, scores from 6 to 10 indicating mild depression, 11 to 15 indicating moderate depression, 16 to 20 reflecting severe depression, and total scores greater than 21 indicating very severe depression.</description>

    <measure>Change in Clinical Impairment Assessment (CIA) total scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Day 1, Day 7, and Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>The CIA is a self-reported 16-item scale of the level of social and psychological impairment that is due to eating disorder characteristics in the past 28 days. The subscales are in mood, self-perception, cognitive functioning, interpersonal functioning and work preference. The items are rated on a Likert scale with four response categories. The scores range from 0 to 48, with a higher score indicating a higher level of impairment.</description>

    <measure>Change in Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) measures</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Day 1, Day 7, and Day 28</time_frame>

    <measure>Change in Eating Disorder readiness to change and motivation for change (ED-RR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Day 1, Day 7, and Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>The ED-RR is a self-reported, two-part 18-item questionnaire that examines readiness to change in nine dimensions of eating disorder behavior (restriction, weight-shape over evaluation, binge eating, vomiting, laxative use, fasting, diuretic use, weight-gain phobia, exercise). The first part measures on a Likert scale from 1-10 the subjective readiness of the patient to change. The second part measures whether the motivation to change is for others, or the self. The scale ranges from 0% (not much for me) to 100% (mostly for me). There is also an option across both parts if the participant does not engage in a particular eating disorder behavior. Higher readiness to change has shown a correlation with a decrease in eating disorder symptoms over time.</description>

    <description>The 5D-ASC is a self-report questionnaire. It measures the acute drug effects using five primary dimensions and respective subdimensions to assess alterations in mood, perception, and experience of self in relation to environment and thought disorder. The 5 dimensions include: oceanic boundlessness, anxious ego dissolution, visionary restructuralization, auditory alterations, and reduction of vigilance. This will be administered immediately after the psilocybin session.</description>
