  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Weight gain with the integrase inhibitors and tenofovir alafenamide has been observed in&#xD;
      observational cohorts and randomized controlled clinical trials. Although some risk factors&#xD;
      have been identified, the cause is unknown and it remains to be determined if the changes are&#xD;
      reversible. The weight gain is of concern to persons living with HIV. This pilot intervention&#xD;
      study is designed to provide preliminary data on whether switching patients with weight gain&#xD;
      on an INSTI-based regimen to a combination of doravirine/tenofovir disoproxil&#xD;
      fumarate/lamivudine (DOR/3TC/TDF, an NNRTI-based regimen) for one year can slow down or even&#xD;
      reverse weight gain. These data will then be used to inform the design and sample size of a&#xD;
      larger switch study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background and Importance: Lifelong antiretroviral treatment (ART) is recommended for all&#xD;
      people living with HIV (PLWH) primarily with integrase strand inhibitor (INSTI)-based&#xD;
      regimens. While weight gain following ART initiation was previously considered &quot;return to&#xD;
      health&quot;, recent studies have raised concerns of weight gain and increasing obesity in PLWH,&#xD;
      most notably with INSTIs and possibly with tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), a preferred&#xD;
      nucleoside backbone agent. The weight gain may be progressive and may increase cardiovascular&#xD;
      risk. A critical unanswered question is whether weight gain and metabolic effects are&#xD;
      permanent or reversible. This data is crucial to optimize ART therapy and health of PLWH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goal/Research Aims: No therapeutic alternatives are substantiated for ART-associated weight&#xD;
      gain. Doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir DF (DOR/3TC/TDF) is an attractive option to explore as&#xD;
      it does not include an INSTI or TAF, is a well tolerated once daily single tablet, minimal&#xD;
      drug interactions and has not been associated with significant weight gain to date. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that switching from an INSTI regimen to DOR/3TC/TDF will slow or&#xD;
      reverse weight gain while maintaining viral suppression. Before embarking on a large&#xD;
      randomized controlled study (RCT), the investigators propose this pilot study to determine&#xD;
      the feasibility and acceptability and to obtain estimate measures of weight change to inform&#xD;
      its design and sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Open-label, exploratory pilot switch study. Patients who are virally suppressed on&#xD;
      an INSTI regimen for &gt;1 year, without ART resistance, and have experienced significant weight&#xD;
      gain will be approached to switch to DOR/3TC/TDF for 48 weeks. Weight, adherence, viral load,&#xD;
      CD4, and other relevant labs will be measured every 3 months. A DXA body scan and body image&#xD;
      questionnaires will be completed at baseline and 12 months. The anticipated sample size is 25&#xD;
      with an aim to recruit 50% male, 50% female.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to determine what proportion of clinic patients meet eligibility&#xD;
      criteria, agree to participate, and complete the study. The secondary objective is to&#xD;
      estimate the distribution of various weight-related outcomes while on DOR/3TC/TDF compared to&#xD;
      previous INSTI regimens. Exploratory outcomes will address metabolic changes and body image&#xD;
      impact.&#xD;
