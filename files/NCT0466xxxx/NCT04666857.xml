  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators aim to test the feasibility for therapists and acceptability&#xD;
      to parents of an early motor intervention for infants with congenital heart disease (CHD)&#xD;
      after open heart surgery. This intervention will be compared to the standard care of&#xD;
      treatment that is recommended for infants with congenital heart disease at the University&#xD;
      Children Hospital Zurich.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this feasibility pilot randomised study children will be randomly assigned to a control&#xD;
      and an intervention group. Children of the control group will receive standard of care for&#xD;
      infants with severe CHD: cardiac surveillance, counselling and screening at the University&#xD;
      Children's Hospital Zurich and standardised developmental checkups by their paediatrician.&#xD;
      Physiotherapy is normally not comprised in standard of care, but some infants may receive&#xD;
      physiotherapy, if they present with obvious signs of motor developmental delay, detected by&#xD;
      the paediatrician later on in their life. Once enrolled in this study, an infant of the&#xD;
      control group will not receive early motor intervention as an infant enrolled in the&#xD;
      intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants randomly assigned to the intervention group will receive early motor intervention,&#xD;
      which will be based on the results of our qualitative study. It will comprise supporting&#xD;
      parents by a paediatric physiotherapist. Parents will be guided on how to best stimulate&#xD;
      their infant's development during daily activities. Parents will be actively involved in the&#xD;
      intervention with the aim to challenge their infant at the limit of its postural capacity and&#xD;
      thus help the infant to optimize its motor repertoire. The intervention will start after&#xD;
      baseline with infants aged 3-6 months and end after three months with infants aged 6-9&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will start at home, then alternating at the Children's Hospital and at home.&#xD;
      Telephone or video counselling will be provided to support parents if needed. The order may&#xD;
      change according to the needs of the family when necessary and adjusted to best fit the daily&#xD;
      routine the family.&#xD;
