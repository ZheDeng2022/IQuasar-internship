  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates whether a scent applied during exposure therapy and during subsequent&#xD;
      sleep will increase the durability of treatment effects for individuals with fear of spiders,&#xD;
      contamination, and enclosed spaces.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Newly acquired memories encoded during wakefulness are spontaneously re-activated during&#xD;
      sleep, resulting in synaptic potentiation and strengthening of the re-activated traces.&#xD;
      Targeted memory reactivation (TMR) typically involves a period of initial learning in the&#xD;
      presence of an olfactory or auditory contextual cue, coupled with later presentation of the&#xD;
      cue during sleep to ostensibly facilitate memory reactivation and consolidation. Numerous&#xD;
      studies have found evidence of improved task performance subsequent to cue-induced neuronal&#xD;
      replay, however application of TMR to treatment of naturally acquired, clinically significant&#xD;
      fear has been limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study will will provide a rigorous test of TMR's efficacy as an augmentative&#xD;
      strategy for exposure therapy. It is hypothesized that participants who sleep in the presence&#xD;
      of the same odor that they are exposed to during exposure therapy will exhibit reduced fear&#xD;
      at follow up, relative to participants who sleep in the presence of a different odor, or a&#xD;
      non-odorous control.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will undergo exposure treatment for their target fear while in the presence of a distinctive odor. Exposure will occur in repeated 4-minute trials.
