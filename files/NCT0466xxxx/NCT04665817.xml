  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To perform CT-QFR, invasive coronary angiography, FFR, and QFR tests on patients with&#xD;
      moderate coronary stenosis after coronary CTA examination. Use FFR as a reference to verify&#xD;
      the diagnostic performance of CT-QFR, and compare it with QFR.&#xD;

      This study is a prospective and single-center trial in China.It intends to enroll 216&#xD;
      patients with coronary artery disease whose coronary artery is determined to be 30-90%&#xD;
      stenosis after coronary CT scan. CT image data will be imported for CT-QFR detection and&#xD;
      undergo coronary angiography within 30 days. Quantitative analysis of coronary angiography&#xD;
      (QCA) was performed with the degree of coronary stenosis. FFR and QFR were detected during&#xD;
      the operation. Use FFR as a reference standard to verify the diagnostic performance of CT-QFR&#xD;
      and QFR. The primary endpoint is the diagnostic accuracy of CT-QFR in identifying&#xD;
      hemodynamically significant coronary stenosis with FFR as the reference standard. Major&#xD;
      secondary endpoint is the non-inferiority of CT-QFR compared with QFR in the patients without&#xD;
      extensively calcified lesions. The completion of the project will provide patients with a&#xD;
      practical non-invasive assessment method of coronary heart disease which provides the best&#xD;
      treatment strategy.&#xD;
