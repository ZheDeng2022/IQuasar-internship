  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of daily and intermittent&#xD;
      dosing of MK-1942 compared to placebo among participants with Treatment-Resistant Depression&#xD;
      (TRD) on a stable course of antidepressant therapy. The dual primary hypotheses of the study&#xD;
      are that the daily MK-1942 treatment and/or intermittent MK-1942 treatment are superior to&#xD;
      placebo in reducing Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score.&#xD;

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Total Score to Week 3</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 3</time_frame>
    <description>The 10-item MADRS scale will be used to evaluate the severity of depressive symptoms. Participants receiving daily dose of MK-1942 will be rated on 10 items, rated on a scale from 0 (normal, no symptom) to 6 (symptoms of maximum severity) with total scores ranging from 0 (normal/no symptom) to 60 (severe depression). Higher scores correspond to greater symptom severity. A negative change score indicates improvement. The longitudinal analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model will be used to report the mean change from baseline in the MADRS total score to Week 3.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D17) Total Score to Week 3</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 3</time_frame>
    <description>The 17 item HAM-D17 scale will be used to evaluate the depressive symptoms experienced over the past week among participants who received daily dose of MK-1942. Participants will be rated using 17 individual items. Each item is rated on a scale from 0 to 2 or 0 to 4 reflective of severity (0 being absence of symptom and higher scores being more severe), with total scores ranging from 0 (no apparent symptoms) to 52 (most severe symptoms). Higher scores correspond to greater symptom. A negative change score indicates improvement. The longitudinal ANCOVA model will be used to report the mean change from baseline in HAM-D17 total score to Week 3.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 3</time_frame>
    <description>A single-item CGI-S scale will be used to assess the severity of depression among participants who received daily dose of MK-1942. The CGI-S is rated on a 7-point scale using a range of responses from 1 (normal, not at all ill) to 7 (among the most extremely ill patients). Higher score corresponds to greater symptom severity. A negative change score indicates improvement. The longitudinal ANCOVA model will be used to report the mean change from baseline in CGI-S score to Week 3.</description>
