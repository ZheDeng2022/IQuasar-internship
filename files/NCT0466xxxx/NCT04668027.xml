  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the research is to explore the diagnostic efficacy of impulse oscillation (IOS)&#xD;
      before and after bronchial provocation test (BPT) and bronchial dilation test (BDT) in&#xD;
      chronic airway disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study has the following objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      to explore the diagnostic value of IOS before and after BPT/BDT in chronic airway disease, to&#xD;
      assess the diagnostic accuracy of IOS in chronic airway disease with special regard to its&#xD;
      discriminating value between asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, to evaluate&#xD;
      the characteristics of airway resistance after BPT/BDT, to evaluate the airway reversibility&#xD;
      and hyperresponsiveness（AHR）in asthma.&#xD;

    <description>The value of respiratory reactance and resistance will be measured by Jaeger MasterScreen pulmonary function meter. And the main indicators that will be recorded are ΔZ5%、ΔR5%、ΔR20%、ΔR5-R20%、ΔR5-R20/R5%、ΔX5%、ΔAx% and ΔFres%. The receiver operating characteristic (Receiver Operating Characteristic, ROC) curve will be used to analyze the predictive value of IOS parameters for the positive results of BPT and BDT.</description>

    <description>The patient is tested for the first IOS after the screening test, and performed the second IOS test immediately after the results of BPT or BDT. The patient takes seats, body relax, make sure the mouthpiece is fully covered by mouth, then clip nose with both hands to cover both sides of the cheek, and then calms breathing one minutes.</description>

    <description>Patient needs to cooperate with the inhalation of acetylcholine stimulants with low to high concentrations, and operates in accordance with the standard nebulized administration procedure. Measure FEV1 after each inhalation and take the high value. The interval between the inhalation of two adjacent doses is 5 minutes, until the FEV1 decrease value is ≥20% of the FEV1 base value or the highest inhalation concentration. The patient needs to cooperate to ensure that the filter is as tight as possible to prevent air leakage, and performs exhalation and inhalation with the greatest strength and fastest speed. After the examination,the patient should inhale the bronchodilator salbutamol sulfate (400ug).</description>

    <description>The patient inhales the salbutamol sulfate (400ug). 15 minutes later, the pulmonary function tester is used for measurement. The patient needs to cooperate to ensure that the filter is as tight as possible to prevent air leakage, and to exhale and breathe with the greatest strength and fastest speed. Inhale.</description>
