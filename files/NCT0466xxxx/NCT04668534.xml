  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with dyspeptic symptoms vary from 10% to 20% globally. Up to 70% of patients with&#xD;
      dyspepsia who undergo endoscopy have unremarkable examination and are diagnosed with&#xD;
      functional dyspepsia (FD). Given the lack of information related to its pathophysiology, the&#xD;
      treatment is largely empirical and of limited efficacy. Previous small study showed&#xD;
      therapeutic potential of transcutaneous auricular vagal nerve stimulation (taVNS) for FD.&#xD;
      This study aims to investigate whether taVNS can improve the dyspeptic symptoms of patients&#xD;
      with FD.&#xD;

    <description>The proportion of patients whose Functional Dyspepsia Symptom Diary Total Symptom Scores were reduced ≥5 after four weeks treatment when compared with baseline.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Dyspepsia Symptom Diary (FDSD)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The FDSD consists of 5 cardinal items (burning in the stomach, stomach pain, bloating, postprandial fullness, and early satiety) and 3 supplementary items (nausea, burping/belching rating, and burping/belching bother). Each item can be scored from 0 (no) to 10 (worst). Total Symptom Score includes the 5 cardinal items and ranges from 0 to 50.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The GSRS contains 15 items. All individual items are scored on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = not at all to 7 = extremely) and are subsequently clustered into five domains (abdominal pain, reflux, indigestion, diarrhea, and constipation); higher scores indicate more severe symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Adequate relief rate</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of patients who acquire overall symptom relief when compared with baseline</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Elimination rate of cardinal symptom</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of patients whose cardinal symptom is completely eliminated when compared with baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Short Form of Nepean Dyspepsia Index (SF-NDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-NDI consists of 10 questions regarding the effects of dyspepsia symptoms (&quot;stomach problems&quot;) on different aspects of life (tension, interference with daily activities, eating/drinking, knowledge/control, and work/study). Each response can be from 1 (not at all affected) to 5 (extremely affected), or 0 (N/A), for a total summed score out of 50.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Hamilton Anxiety and Depression Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Anxiety and depression of patients are assessed by using Hamilton Anxiety and Depression Scale.&#xD;
Hamilton Anxiety Scale consists of 14 items. Each item is scored on a scale from 0 (absent) to 4 (most severe) with a total score range of 0-56.&#xD;
Hamilton Depression Scale consists of 17 items. Individual items scored on 3 point (0 to 2) or 5 point scale (0 to 4); 0=absent, 4=most severe. Total score: 0 to 52.</description>
