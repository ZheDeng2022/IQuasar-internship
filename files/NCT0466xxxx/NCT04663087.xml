  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the prehospital use of the XSTAT device to control bleeding in&#xD;
      junctional wounds. Participants will be randomized to the use of XSTAT versus standard care.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The XSTAT® device injects small, rapidly-expanding cellulose sponges into the wound cavity&#xD;
      using a syringe-like delivery system. In the wound, XSTAT® sponges expand and swell to fill&#xD;
      the wound cavity, within 20 seconds of contact with blood, facilitating compression of&#xD;
      bleeding structures. XSTAT® can be applied through skin wounds. The system can readily access&#xD;
      deep vascular structures. While rapidly hemostatic, the hemostatic sponges are also&#xD;
      relatively easy to remove. In the setting of junctional bleeding, XSTAT® may allow for&#xD;
      hemostatic pressure generation from within the wound tract rather than from external&#xD;
      compression (as with a tourniquet or manual compression).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemorrhage should be controlled as early as possible, ideally before reaching a trauma center&#xD;
      or medical treatment facility. Given its small size, low weight, and ease of application, the&#xD;
      XSTAT® device is well-suited for prehospital use, in both the civilian and military setting,&#xD;
      and this is probably where the device's applicability lies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators anticipate that a full-scale trial will be conducted based on the questions&#xD;
      this pilot study addresses, including the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the number of penetrating junctional zone injuries encountered in the prehospital&#xD;
           civilian setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the feasibility of randomizing patients in the prehospital setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. usability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. validation of the proposed primary outcome of an efficacy trial.&#xD;

    <description>The investigators will track the number of junctional wounds that are treated by participating EMS personnel versus the number of participants who were enrolled in this study. This will help the investigators understand how many wounds of this type happen, and how many would possibly benefit from the use of the XSTAT device.</description>
