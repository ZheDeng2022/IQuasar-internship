      This is a randomized, double-blind, comparative, parallel group study of the efficacy, safety&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) is a chronic progressive disease that is the main&#xD;
      cause of visual disability in elderly patients (aged over 60 years) in industrialized&#xD;
      countries. Due to increased human longevity, it is expected for the number of patients with&#xD;
      this disease to grow worldwide up to 288 million people by 2040. The highest risk of vision&#xD;
      loss is posed by neovascular (exudative or wet ARMD) macular degeneration observed in 10-20%&#xD;
      of cases. The pathological changes of ARMD are based on the increased production of the&#xD;
      vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) which affects proprioceptors located on the surface&#xD;
      of endothelial cells and causes an anomalous permeability of vessels and stimulates&#xD;
      neovascularization GNR-067 (JSC &quot;GENERIUM&quot;, the Russian Federation) is a humanized&#xD;
      recombinant monoclonal antibody selectively binding to the human vascular endothelial growth&#xD;
      factor [VEGF-A] and is a biosimilar of of the original product Lucentis® (&quot;Novartis Pharma&#xD;
      AG&quot;, Switzerland).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This III phase study is aimed to compare the effectiveness, safety, pharmacokinetics and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of GNR-067 (JSC &quot;GENERIUM&quot;, the Russian Federation) and Lucentis® (&quot;Novartis&#xD;
      Pharma AG&quot;, Switzerland) in order to register of the drug GNR-067 (JSC &quot;GENERIUM&quot;, the&#xD;
      Russian Federation), a solution for intraocular injection administration, in the Russian&#xD;
      Federation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study included patients (n = 408) aged 50 years and older with neovascular (wet)&#xD;
      age-related macular degeneration, types 1 and 2 (occult and classical) choroidal&#xD;
      neovascularization (CNV) with the following activity signs: accumulation of intraretinal&#xD;
      and/or subretinal (under the neurosensory retina or pigment epithelium) fluid, extravasal dye&#xD;
      exit from the newly formed vessels, and the presence of a subfoveal and/or juxtafoveal&#xD;
      membrane and the presence of CNV foci of more than 50% of the total lesion area. With block&#xD;
      randomization, the patients were divided into two groups in a 2:1 ratio&#xD;
      (investigational/reference product): 272 patients to the group of the investigational product&#xD;
      GNR-067 and 136 patients to the group of the reference product Lucentis®. The duration of the&#xD;
      study for each patient will be approximately 52 ± 4 weeks, including a screening period (3&#xD;
      weeks), treatment period and a follow-up period (4 weeks). In this study GNR-067 and&#xD;
      Lucentis® will be used intravitreally once every 4 weeks (thirteen injections in total) in&#xD;
      0.5 mg doses (the injection volume is 0.05 mL).&#xD;
