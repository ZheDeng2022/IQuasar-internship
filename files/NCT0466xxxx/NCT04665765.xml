      This phase II trial studies the effect of polatuzumab vedotin, rituximab, ifosfamide,&#xD;
      carboplatin, and etoposide as initial salvage therapy in treating patients with diffuse large&#xD;
      B-cell lymphoma that has come back (relapsed) or does not respond to treatment (refractory).&#xD;
      Polatuzumab vedotin is a monoclonal antibody, polatuzumab, linked to a toxic agent called&#xD;
      vedotin. Polatuzumab attaches to CD79b positive cancer cells in a targeted way and delivers&#xD;
      vedotin to kill them. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the ability&#xD;
      of cancer cells to grow and spread. Chemotherapy drugs, such as ifosfamide, carboplatin, and&#xD;
      etoposide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the&#xD;
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving&#xD;
      chemotherapy with immunotherapy may kill more cancer cells in patients with diffuse large&#xD;
      B-cell lymphoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the safety and tolerability of polatuzumab vedotin (Pola) added to rituximab,&#xD;
      ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide (PolaR-ICE) as first salvage therapy for relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory (R/R) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). (Safety Lead-in) II. Evaluate the&#xD;
      anti-tumor activity of PolaR-ICE as first salvage therapy for R/R DLBCL as assessed by the&#xD;
      complete response rate after 2 cycles. (Phase 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the overall response rate to PolaR-ICE as first salvage therapy for R/R DLBCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate the progression-free and overall survival of patients who received PolaR-ICE as&#xD;
      first salvage therapy for R/R DLBCL followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT)&#xD;
      and single-agent Pola consolidation after ASCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Evaluate the CR rate after Pola consolidation among those who were partial response (PR)&#xD;
      at ASCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Evaluate the toxicity of PolaR-ICE salvage therapy and that of Pola consolidation after&#xD;
      ASCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Assess the rate of stem cell mobilization and collection failure in patients with R/R&#xD;
      DLBCL who receive PolaR-ICE as first salvage therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess the kinetics of circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) after PolaR-ICE as&#xD;
      first salvage therapy for R/R DLBCL followed by ASCT and single-agent Pola consolidation&#xD;
      after ASCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Assess possible biomarkers of response to PolaR-ICE in patients with R/R DLBCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Examine the association between clinical outcomes (response, progression-free survival&#xD;
      [PFS]) and pathological tumor characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Examine the association between clinical outcomes (response, PFS) and circulating tumor&#xD;
      (ct)DNA characteristics (mutation profile, kinetics of clearance).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SALVAGE THERAPY: Patients receive polatuzumab vedotin intravenously (IV) on day 1, rituximab&#xD;
      IV on day 1, etoposide IV on days 1-3, carboplatin IV on day 2, and ifosfamide IV on day 2 or&#xD;
      days 1-3. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 2-3 cycles in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve complete response, partial&#xD;
      response or stable disease by cycle 2 day 15 (C2D15) may receive 1 additional cycle of&#xD;
      PolaR-ICE IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONSOLIDATION THERAPY: Within 30-60 days after ASCT, patients receive polatuzumab vedotin IV&#xD;
      on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 3-4 cycles in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, and then&#xD;
      periodically for up to 2 years.&#xD;
