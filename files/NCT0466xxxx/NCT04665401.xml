  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Social functioning deficits are among the most disabling and difficult to treat aspects of&#xD;
      schizophrenia. An essential component of social functioning is metacognition-a process that&#xD;
      is profoundly disrupted in schizophrenia and represents the ability to reflect upon the&#xD;
      mental states of oneself and others. To date, treatment efforts in schizophrenia have been&#xD;
      hindered by barriers in accurately monitoring client's real-world social interactions.&#xD;
      Recently, wearable technologies have evolved to provide therapists with innovative,&#xD;
      ecologically-valid tools. The Electronically Activated Recorder is a wearable audio recorder&#xD;
      that collects behavioral samples at pre-programmed intervals; it holds great promise as a&#xD;
      method for yielding concrete, real-world examples of social interactions that can be used by&#xD;
      therapists in session to enhance metacognition. Despite the immense costs of social&#xD;
      functioning deficits, no previous studies have investigated whether functioning can be&#xD;
      improved by integrating wearable audio recorders with psychosocial interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By enhancing therapy using a wearable recording device, this proposal's primary goal is to&#xD;
      implement a novel intervention that targets metacognitive deficits to improve social&#xD;
      functioning. The novel intervention will be tailored to individual clients-based on the&#xD;
      content of recorded social interactions-in a way that is not possible using traditional&#xD;
      psychotherapy. This will allow clients and therapists to step out of the therapy room by&#xD;
      offering a window into how clients process material in real-world interactions. In this&#xD;
      study, a randomized controlled trial will be conducted with two schizophrenia groups&#xD;
      receiving six months of individualized: 1) Metacognition Reflection and Insight Therapy&#xD;
      (MERIT) alone (Standard MERIT); and 2) Tailored MERIT using wearable audio recorders. In this&#xD;
      study, our specific aims will test feasibility, effectiveness, and acceptability of Tailored&#xD;
      MERIT.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Change from baseline symptoms to symptoms after 6 months of MERIT</time_frame>
    <description>30 item measure of symptoms; each item is rated 1 to 7, with greater scores representing more severe symptoms (and lower scores indicating better functioning)</description>

    <measure>EAR Adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>Average of EAR adherence from baseline and 6 month assessment sessions</time_frame>
    <description>Objective measure of how often EAR was worn; 0 (not worn) and 1 (worn) scores given at each of 48 potential time points. Total score represents frequency that the EAR is worn across all time points.</description>

    <description>Assessment of how acceptable wearing the EAR was and how typical days were that EAR was worn. Scores for each item range from 1 to 5 with greater scores indicating greater problems (and lower acceptability).</description>

    <description>EAR coding can be implemented to rate different forms of objective behaviors; codes generated using different scales but primarily use a 0 (not present) or 1 (present) coding scheme. Greater scores typically represent presence of that which is being coded.</description>
