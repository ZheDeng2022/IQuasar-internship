  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Oslo Sports Trauma Research Center (OSTRC) was established in May 2000 at the Norwegian&#xD;
      School of Sport Sciences.The OSTRC aims to prevent injuries and other health problems related&#xD;
      to sports. The majority of the research conducted at OSTRC involves elite sports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of the Oslo Sports Trauma Research&#xD;
      Center (OSTRC) Injury Prevention Program in reducing injuries among athletes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: that Oslo Sports Trauma Research Center (OSTRC) Injury Prevention Program has a&#xD;
      beneficial effect in terms of injury prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of the Oslo Sports Trauma Research&#xD;
      Center (OSTRC) Injury Prevention Program in reducing injuries among athletes.&#xD;

      Study type Interventional Description of intervention(s) / exposure: The intervention group&#xD;
      will be instructed to include the Oslo Sports Trauma Research Center (OSTRC) Injury&#xD;
      Prevention Program as a warm up before training session (3 times per week) during one season&#xD;
      (6 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group sessions will be administered by an exercise physiologist and/ or athletic trainer and/&#xD;
      or soccer coaches and/ or strength and conditioning specialists and/ or physiotherapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session attendance checklists will be used to assess or monitor adherence to the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparator / control treatment The control group will practice their usual warm up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usual warm up is defined as any basic exercises performed before a performance or practice to&#xD;
      prepare the muscles for vigorous actions.&#xD;

    <description>Injury is defined according to a consensus statement on injury definitions and data collection procedures in soccer studies; an injury will be recorded if it caused the player to be unable to completely participate in the following match or training session.Injury rates will be summarised as number of injuries per 1000 player-hours for both matches and training. Exposure time in hours will be calculated for each team over a 6-month period.</description>

    <description>Recurrent injury is defined as a repeat episode of a fully recovered injury. Injury is defined according to a consensus statement on injury definitions and data collection procedures in soccer studies; an injury will be recorded if it caused the player to be unable to completely participate in the following match or training session.</description>
