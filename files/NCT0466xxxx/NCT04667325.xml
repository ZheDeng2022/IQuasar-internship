  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease is one of the most common genetic diseases in the world. (1) It is&#xD;
      characterized by the production of abnormal hemoglobin mainly responsible for vaso-occlusive&#xD;
      clinical manifestations and chronic hemolysis with anemia. (2) It is therefore a chronic&#xD;
      disease with major acute complications, such as acute chest syndrome. The treatment for this&#xD;
      syndrome will be based on oxygenation, hydration and analgesia. At the physiotherapy level,&#xD;
      we will have an action on the prevention and treatment of the syndrome by incentive&#xD;
      spirometry. (3,4) In fact, it is currently the only physiotherapy treatment that has proven&#xD;
      its effectiveness and is recommended for sickle cell patients. (3) As part of prevention, it&#xD;
      is recommended to prescribe incentive spirometry during vaso-occlusive crisis. It has been&#xD;
      shown to reduce the risk of atelectasis and significantly limit the risk of developing ACS.&#xD;
      (5) In treatment, it makes it possible to regain normal chest amplification and therefore to&#xD;
      allow ventilation of unventilated areas. (3.4) However, in order to increase therapeutic&#xD;
      efficacy, patient compliance is essential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adherence to treatment is a major problem in chronic diseases. Currently, it is estimated&#xD;
      that 80% of patients with chronic conditions do not sufficiently follow their therapy, which&#xD;
      limits the optimization of benefits. (6) This is the case in sickle cell patients, especially&#xD;
      with hydroxyurea which is their disease-modifying treatment. Lack of adherence is the most&#xD;
      common cause of primary failure of this treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During various treatments, we noticed the patients' lack of compliance with spirometry.&#xD;
      Indeed, we explained to the patient how to do the incentive spirometry, so that he could&#xD;
      practice it several times a day as recommended. When we returned the next day, or after a&#xD;
      weekend, most of the time the patients had little or no observance. So I wanted to know if&#xD;
      this concerns a majority of patients with sickle cell disease. Indeed, it appears important&#xD;
      to assess compliance in these patients in order to improve the effectiveness of treatment and&#xD;
      reduce the risk of ACS.&#xD;
