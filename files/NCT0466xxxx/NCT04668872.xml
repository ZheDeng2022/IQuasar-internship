  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to study the way radioembolization works by collecting biopsy&#xD;
      samples of participants' tumors after the procedure. This research may improve the way that&#xD;
      radioembolization is performed, which could help people whose cancer has spread to the liver.&#xD;
      The research may also provide information about how tumors respond to radioembolization.&#xD;

    <description>Y90 TARE will be performed as standard of care (SOC)/clinically indicated: 1) in a lobar or sub-lobar fashion (depending on tumor involvement and location; also targeting the tumor as selective as possible and sparing as much as possible of non-involved liver parenchyma), for participants with extensive bilobar disease or 2) in a radiation segmentectomy approach, intending to deliver 190 Gy radiation dose to target tumor: for patients with limited liver metastatic disease, not amenable for surgery or ablation.</description>

        The patients will be identified and recruited from the existing patient population in the&#xD;
        Interventional Oncology/Radiology Service of the Department of Radiology at Memorial&#xD;
        Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC). The patients will be presented with a study consent&#xD;
        form and an explanation of any concerns they may have by the Principal Investigator or&#xD;
        research team (i.e. Co-Investigators and consenting professionals).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

             days prior to treatment OR clinical indication for biopsy at the time of the treatment&#xD;
             under the institutional guidelines for progression of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  adequate blood cell counts (WBC &gt; 1.5 x 109/L, platelet count &gt; 50 x 109/L)&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  total bilirubin level ≤ 1.5 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
        Additional inclusion criteria for patients, undergoing 90Y radiation segmentectomy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A. patients not amenable to surgery or thermal ablation&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Study exclusion criteria will be similar to general TARE exclusion criteria, which are as&#xD;
        follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  prior hepatic radiotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  severe cirrhosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  severe portal hypertension&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  uncorrectable flow to the gastrointestinal tract and/or &gt;30 Gy (or &gt;50 Gy in multiple&#xD;
             sessions) radiation absorbed dose to the lungs&#xD;
&#xD;
        All patients with liver-dominant disease will be considered candidates for TARE even in the&#xD;
        face of oligometastatic (up to 5 sites) extrahepatic disease, that is stable or controlled&#xD;
        by chemotherapy.&#xD;
