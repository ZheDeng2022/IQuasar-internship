  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with dry eye, defined as corneal staining and a reduced tear breakup time,&#xD;
      lifitegrast will improve higher order aberrations, ocular scatter index, corneal staining,&#xD;
      and TBUT as soon as 1 week after initiating treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      This is a multicenter, prospective, open label, self-controlled, single group study of the&#xD;
      efficacy of Lifitegrast 5% in improving higher order aberrations, ocular scatter index, and&#xD;
      best corrected visual acuity in patients with dry eye. All patients will receive lifitegrast&#xD;
      5% for 4 weeks and will be evaluated at baseline (before treatment) and at 7, 14, and 28 days&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Central or inferior corneal fluorescein staining defined by the Oxford Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Reduced tear break up time (TBUT) â‰¤ 10 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to comprehend and sign a statement of informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and able to complete all required postoperative visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ocular surgery (e.g., intraocular, oculoplastic, corneal or refractive surgical&#xD;
             procedure performed in the study eye within the last 3 months or at any time that in&#xD;
             the investigator's clinical judgment if it would interfere with the outcome measures&#xD;
             of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant ocular trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active ocular Herpes simplex or Herpes Zoster infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ocular inflammation (uveitis, iritis, scleritis, episcleritis, keratitis,&#xD;
             conjunctivitis) that is active, at the discretion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ocular infection (e.g., viral, bacterial, mycobacterial, protozoan or fungal infection&#xD;
             or the cornea, conjunctiva, lacrimal gland, lacrimal sac or eyelids including&#xD;
             hordeolum/stye), at the discretion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active, systemic or local disease condition that causes clinically significant ocular&#xD;
             surface irritation such that it could interfere with the questions in the survey and&#xD;
             examination findings, in the opinion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Moderate to severe (Grade 2-4) allergic, vernal or giant papillary conjunctivitis that&#xD;
             would interfere with study findings, in the opinion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe (Grade 3 or 4) inflammation of the eyelid (e.g., blepharochalasis,&#xD;
             staphylococcal blepharitis or seborrheic blepharitis)&#xD;
&#xD;

             ectropion, tumor, edema, blepharospasm, lagophthalmos, severe trichiasis, severe&#xD;
             ptosis) that would interfere with study findings, in the opinion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ocular surface abnormality that may compromise the corneal integrity (e.g., prior&#xD;
             chemical burn, recurrent corneal erosion, corneal epithelial defect, Grade 3 corneal&#xD;
             fluorescein staining, map dot fingerprint dystrophy, or the effect of any other&#xD;
             ophthalmic medication that might in the opinion of the investigator compromise the&#xD;
             ocular surface integrity).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are under age 18, pregnant or breastfeeding, or who may become pregnant&#xD;
             during participation in the study.&#xD;
