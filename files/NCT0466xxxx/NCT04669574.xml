      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep disturbances are among the most common and severe symptoms reported by people with&#xD;
      primary brain tumors (PBT). Smart wearable devices like Fitbits may be able to give detailed&#xD;
      data about people s sleep and circadian rhythms. In this study, researchers will use Fitbits&#xD;
      to learn more about sleep disruptions caused by tumors. This might help them design better&#xD;
      future treatment and supportive care studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To describe sleep disturbances and circadian disruption in people with PBT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      English-speaking adults ages 18 and older who have PBT and are enrolled in the NIH study,&#xD;
      Evaluation of the Natural History of and Specimen Banking for Patients with Tumors of the&#xD;
      Central Nervous System. It is also known as the Natural History Study, trial #16C0151.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened over the telephone or in person. They will be asked about their&#xD;
      medical history. Their cancer diagnosis will be confirmed through test results and pathology&#xD;
      reports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete 4 surveys. The surveys take about 20 minutes to complete and will&#xD;
      ask about:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quality of their sleep&#xD;
&#xD;
      Their ability to fall asleep and stay asleep&#xD;
&#xD;
      How the quality of their sleep affects their daily activities&#xD;
&#xD;
      Their sleep hygiene and preferences&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get a Fitbit. It looks like a watch and is worn on the wrist. They will&#xD;
      connect the device to their smart phone to track sleep, heart rate, and activity. They will&#xD;
      wear it for 1 month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will keep a daily sleep diary for 1 week. It will be sent via an electronic&#xD;
      link. They will also repeat 2 of the surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation will last for 1 month.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep disturbances are among the most common and severe symptoms reported in the Primary&#xD;
      Brain Tumor (PBT)population and incidence rates are associated with oncologic therapies,&#xD;
      particularly radiotherapy. Smart wearable devices have the potential to provide detailed&#xD;
      information about sleep and circadian rhythms in human subjects with lower potential for data&#xD;
      loss, as devices sync automatically and require less charging time. Measurement of sleep&#xD;
      through smart wearables, also eliminates the difficulties of recording in a sleep clinic and&#xD;
      allows for longer monitoring periods. Previous smart wearable research in healthy controls&#xD;
      has found that the Fitbit Charge 3TM model performs better than actigraphy and is the most&#xD;
      comparable to polysomnography, the gold standard of sleep detection. Currently, there are&#xD;
      very few studies examining sleep or circadian rhythms with these devices in the PBT&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To assess detection of sleep disturbances in PBT patients using the physiological sleep&#xD;
      measurements attained from smart wearable devices, as well as, the correlation with&#xD;
      self-reported sleep instruments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PBT patients must be enrolled on the Natural History Study (NHS) trial in the&#xD;
           Neuro-Oncology Branch (NOB) (all tumor types and grades eligible).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants with histologically documented PBT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Concurrent enrollment in other NOB trials is permissible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adults (greater than or equal to 18 years of age) who are English-speaking and able to&#xD;
           self-report symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exclude participants without tissue diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants who are unwilling or unable to synchronize or link their Fitbit smart&#xD;
           wearable device to their personal smart phone are excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A total of 160 PBT participants will participate in this observational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be sampled in a cross-sectional design at 1 of 4 timepoints across the&#xD;
           disease course. The study will collect sleep, activity and heart rate information over a&#xD;
           one-month period via Fitbit wearable device, which will be provided to patients at no&#xD;
           cost. This data includes fine measurements of sleep including sleep stages, latency,&#xD;
           fragmentation and efficiency, as well as, daytime napping duration and bout number.&#xD;
           Additionally, circadian rhythms parameters will be calculated to determine features&#xD;
           associated with chronodisruption including amplitude dampening, precision of rhythm&#xD;
           onset/offset, and rhythm stability. The study will also include the collection of&#xD;
           established self-reported patient reported outcome (PRO) measures for sleep and&#xD;
           circadian rhythms. Participants will be given sleep diaries to be completed at-home for&#xD;
           the fourth week of recording and will be asked to fill out the PRO measures during that&#xD;
           fourth week at the completion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Descriptive statistics, T-tests, Wilcoxon rank sum tests, and multiple logistic&#xD;
           regression models will be used to evaluate the feasibility of the Fitbit device for&#xD;
           measuring sleep disturbance and circadian disruption in participants. Pearson or&#xD;
           Spearman correlations will be used to evaluate the relationship between the Fitbit&#xD;
           wearable biological measures of sleep and circadian rhythms and self-reported PROs.&#xD;
