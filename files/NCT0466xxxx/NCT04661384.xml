      This phase I trial investigates the side effects of brain tumor-specific immune cells&#xD;
      (IL13Ralpha2-CAR T cells) in treating patients with leptomeningeal disease from glioblastoma,&#xD;
      ependymoma, or medulloblastoma. Immune cells are part of the immune system and help the body&#xD;
      fight infections and other diseases. Immune cells can be engineered to destroy brain tumor&#xD;
      cells in the laboratory. IL13Ralpha2-CAR T cells is brain tumor specific and can enter and&#xD;
      express its genes in immune cells. Giving IL13Ralpha2-CAR T cells may better recognize and&#xD;
      destroy brain tumor cells in patients with leptomeningeal disease from glioblastoma,&#xD;
      ependymoma or medulloblastoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Examine and describe the safety and feasibility of IL13Ralpha2-specific hinge-optimized&#xD;
      41BB-co-stimulatory CAR truncated CD19-expressing autologous T-lymphocytes (IL13Ralpha2-CAR T&#xD;
      cells) through intracerebroventricular (ICV) delivery as adjuvant therapy in participants&#xD;
      with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ia. IL13Ralpha2+ leptomeningeal disease from glioblastoma (arm 1). Ib. IL13Ralpha2+&#xD;
      leptomeningeal disease from ependymoma or medulloblastoma (arm 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the activity of IL13Ralpha2-CAR T cells based on survival rate at 3 months for&#xD;
      both arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Describe persistence, expansion and phenotype of endogenous and IL13Ralpha2-CAR CAR T&#xD;
      cells in peripheral blood (PB), tumor cyst fluid (TCF) and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), when&#xD;
      available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Describe cytokine levels in PB, TCF, and CSF (when available) over the study period for&#xD;
      each arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Estimate the rate of disease response by Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology&#xD;
      Leptomeningeal Metastases (RANO LM) criteria by study arm where an active response is defined&#xD;
      as stable disease or better.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Estimate rate of progression free survival at 3 months by study arm. V. Estimate rate of&#xD;
      overall survival (OS) at 3 months by study arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. In study participants who undergo post therapy biopsy/resection or autopsy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIa. Evaluate IL13Ralpha2-CAR T cell persistence in the tumor tissue and the location of the&#xD;
      IL13Ralpha2-CAR T cells with respect to the infusion site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIb. Evaluate IL13Ralpha2 antigen on tumor tissue pre- and post-CAR T cell therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. Use biomathematical modeling of tumor growth to evaluate benefit of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive IL13Ralpha2-CAR T cells ICV over 5 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every&#xD;
      7 days for 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients&#xD;
      may receive additional cycles per the discretion of the principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, months 3, 6, 9, 12,&#xD;
      and then yearly for up to 15 years.&#xD;
