  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common biopsy-proven&#xD;
      glomerulonephritis in the world. Approximately 40% of IgAN patients reach end-stage kidney&#xD;
      disease (ESKD) 20 years after their kidney biopsy. The high prevalence of ESKD suggests the&#xD;
      need to move from a generalized therapy for all patients to personalized therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many RCTs have been conducted stratifying patients based on the laboratory findings (serum&#xD;
      creatinine, eGFR and daily proteinuria). In contrast, data from the kidney biopsy has been&#xD;
      used only for clinical diagnosis. Therefore, IgAN patients with acute and/or chronic renal&#xD;
      lesions have been equally distributed in experimental and control arms of the randomized&#xD;
      clinical trials (RCTs) The clinical study of IgAN (CLIgAN) is a multicentre, prospective,&#xD;
      controlled and open-label randomized clinical trial based on patients' stratification at the&#xD;
      time of their kidney biopsy. The investigators will consider, first, the type of renal&#xD;
      lesions followed by the serum creatinine values, eGFR and proteinuria. IgAN patients with&#xD;
      active renal lesions (n=132) will be enrolled in the first RCT (ACIgAN) in which they will&#xD;
      receive corticosteroids combined with RASB or only RASB. IgAN patients with chronic renal&#xD;
      lesions (n=294) will be enrolled in the second RCT (CHRONIgAN) in which they will receive the&#xD;
      SGLT2 inhibitor combined with RASB compared with RASB alone. Using this approach, the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that patients could receive personalized therapy based on renal&#xD;
      lesions to ensure that the right drug gets to the right patient at the right time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, we developed a Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) tool using artificial&#xD;
      intelligence (artificial neural networks) to identify IgAN patients at high risk of&#xD;
      developing ESKD. The IgAN tool was validated in a retrospective cohort of IgAN patients but&#xD;
      not in a prospective clinical study. The investigators propose to measure the power of the&#xD;
      CDSS tool in patients enrolled in both RCTs to determine whether personalized therapy can&#xD;
      slow the decline of the renal function to delay the ESKD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CLIgAN study also includes a cutting-edge molecular study for precision therapy&#xD;
      (PRECIgAN).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE. Idiopathic Immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common&#xD;
      biopsy-proven glomerulonephritis in the world. It is more prevalent in Asia than in Europe&#xD;
      and the US worldwide. Approximately 40% of IgAN patients reach end-stage kidney disease&#xD;
      (ESKD) 20 years after their kidney biopsy. The high prevalence of ESKD shows that IgAN has a&#xD;
      significant economic impact in the all countries because renal replacement therapy is costly.&#xD;
      Moreover, the disease's onset in the second and third decades of life represents a social&#xD;
      challenge because young adult patients are very active and highly productive in the&#xD;
      workplace. This challenge is one more reason to move from a generalized therapy for all&#xD;
      patients to a personalized therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first edition of the KDIGO guidelines, published in 2012, suggested different therapeutic&#xD;
      approaches for IgAN patients based on the clinical setting. Unfortunately, the KDIGO&#xD;
      guidelines do not consider the presence of acute and chronic renal lesions at the time of the&#xD;
      kidney biopsy for therapy decision. The investigators of the clinical study in IgAN patients&#xD;
      (CLIgAN) will consider for the patient's stratification the type of renal lesions,&#xD;
      preliminarily, and then the clinical parameters as estimated glomerular filtration rate&#xD;
      (eGFR) and proteinuria because the categorization of proteinuria and eGFR is not enough for a&#xD;
      complete diagnosis of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS. Considering the critical role of kidney biopsy, in this CLIgAN study the investigators&#xD;
      plan to evaluate (i) the effect of corticosteroids combined with RASBs in IgAN patients with&#xD;
      active renal lesions (ACIgAN) versus RASBs alone to determine whether the renal lesions are&#xD;
      reversed by corticosteroids; (ii) the effect of SGLT2i in patients with chronic renal lesions&#xD;
      (CHRONIgAN) to determine whether a delay of the ESKD onset is achieved; (iii) after the&#xD;
      prediction of ESKD through the IgAN CDSS tool to determine whether personalized therapy&#xD;
      delays the impairment of the renal function; (iv) finally, on a small cohort of active and&#xD;
      chronic IgAN patients enrolled in the CLIgAN study, a cutting edge-molecular study will be&#xD;
      conducted to evaluate the effect of precision therapy (PRETIgAN).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN. The investigators have designed a prospective, multicentre, open-label clinical&#xD;
      study that includes two multicentre randomized controlled trials (RCTs) based on the kidney&#xD;
      biopsy report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first RCT, patients with active renal lesions (E1 and/or C1,2), daily proteinuria &gt;0.5&#xD;
      g and GFR ≥ 30 ml/min/1.72 m2 will be enrolled. They will be randomized to receive&#xD;
      corticosteroids combined with RASBs in the experimental arm or RASBs alone in the control&#xD;
      arm. Aim of this trial is to demostrate the benefit of corticosteroids in patients with&#xD;
      active renal lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second RCT, patients with chronic renal lesions (T1,2) and patients with moderate&#xD;
      renal lesions (M0,1; S0,1; T0; E0; C0) at high or very high CKD risk (proteinuria&gt; 0.5 g/day&#xD;
      and GFR ≥ 30ml/min/1.73 m2) will be enrolled. They will be randomized to receive SGLT2&#xD;
      inhibitor (SGLT2i) combined with RASBs (experimental arm) or RASBs alone (control arm). Aim&#xD;
      of this trial is demostrate the benefit of SGLT2i combined with RASBs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, we have designed two RCTs (i) to study personalized therapy in biopsy-proven&#xD;
      IgAN patients and (II) to monitor the outcomes to look at whether personalized therapy may&#xD;
      delay the time to reach the ESKD predicted by our IgAN tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RECRUITMENT AND FOLLOW-UP. Renal Units will be involved in the enrollment of IgAN patients&#xD;
      during a period of three years. The follow-up study to measure the outcomes will consist of&#xD;
      regular visits at the prescribed times and to collect clinical and laboratory data and&#xD;
      information on drug adherence. Before the trial is complete, each patient will receive a&#xD;
      final visit in the outpatient section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OTHER MEAUSURES. Age, body mass index, eradication of infectious foci, or concurrent&#xD;
      antibiotic therapy to prevent infections or to avoid the transformation of a trivial&#xD;
      infection into a severe complication will be considered. In addition, home and life&#xD;
      conditions and culture will be analyzed. Regular daily exercise to prevent obesity and&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease will be prescribed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary counseling. Patients with CKD stage 1 and 2 will observe the Mediterranean diet&#xD;
      combined with reduced intake of proteins (1.0 - 0.8 g/kg bw/day). A reduced intake of&#xD;
      proteins (0.6 - 0.8 g/kg bw/day) will also be prescribed to patients with CKD stage 3. Salt&#xD;
      intake will be limited to 1.5 g/day. Dietary compliance will be assessed by measuring daily&#xD;
      urinary sodium and urea excretion. Physical activity will be observed for 30 min. every day,&#xD;
      primarily in the morning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severe adverse events. Infections, impaired glucose tolerance, weight gain, hypoglycemia will&#xD;
      be monitored during the follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VARIABLES OF THE DISEASE. Kidney biopsy will be scored according to the Oxford classification&#xD;
      because it is a simple method for predicting renal outcomes and for differentiating active&#xD;
      and chronic renal lesions. Therefore, the kidney biopsy will be the principal key-note, not&#xD;
      only for diagnosis but also for personalized therapy, because active renal lesions (E1,C1,2)&#xD;
      will be treated with immediate corticosteroid therapy before lesions become chronic. In some&#xD;
      RCTs IgAN patients received six months of RASBs treatment before their enrollment for&#xD;
      corticosteroid therapy. In our opinion this approach is not correct because the acute renal&#xD;
      lesions evolve in the chronic stage and are no-responsive to corticosteroid therapy.&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim of the first RCT is early treatment of the active renal lesions because&#xD;
      they are responsible for altered GFR and proteinuria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The definition of remission or no response of the MESTC lesions to therapy in published&#xD;
      studies is inconsistent. Therefore, high-quality clinical trials with a large sample size are&#xD;
      necessary to define the response of histological renal lesions to corticosteroids in&#xD;
      biopsy-proven IgAN. The kidney biopsy will be analyzed using digital histopathologic analysis&#xD;
      coupled with machine-learning tools. At least eight glomeruli will be available for a correct&#xD;
      diagnosis. Renal tissue sections will be stained with hematoxylin and eosin, periodic&#xD;
      acid-Schiff and methenamine silver. The last edition of the Oxford classification (MESTC)&#xD;
      will be used for scoring the renal lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three independent renal pathologists, blinded to the study results, will score the lesions in&#xD;
      the kidney biopsy using the Aperio System. The histology report will be necessary for the&#xD;
      enrollment of patients. No larger RCT has confirmed that the disease improves when clinical&#xD;
      decisions are made in a short time in the presence of the MESTC score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum creatinine will be measured using enzymatic methods calibrated to the National&#xD;
           Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) liquid chromatography isotope dilution&#xD;
           mass spectrometry method. eGFR creatinine will be evaluated by the CKD-EPI formula.&#xD;
           Moreover, the slope of eGFR (16) will be calculated. Patients, categorized in CKD stages&#xD;
           1 to 3, will be included in the clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proteinuria. Patients will collect 24 hour urine for proteinuria. Values of &gt;0.5 g/ day&#xD;
           will be considered abnormal. Proteinuria reduction (geometric mean of 30% within 6&#xD;
           months), time-average proteinuria (TA-P) and slope of proteinuria will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum creatinine, proteinuria, age and hypertension have a lower weight when histological&#xD;
      lesions are not considered. This finding highlights the importance of the kidney biopsy, not&#xD;
      only for diagnosis but for personalized treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood hypertension is defined when values are &gt; 130/80 mmHg or in subjects treated with&#xD;
           anti-hypertensive drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For hyperuricemia allopurinol therapy is recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACIgAN. Data from the literature show a difference in renal survival between corticosteroids&#xD;
      and controls when we assume a difference of 50% in the primary end point (i.e. in the&#xD;
      between-arms difference of delta 24 hour proteinuria from baseline to 6 months) as clinically&#xD;
      relevant. We assume that a mean delta proteinuria (±SD) from baseline to 6 months in patients&#xD;
      treated with Ramipril alone (control arm) is 0.6±1.0 g/24 hours versus a mean delta&#xD;
      proteinuria (±SD) from baseline to 6 months in patients treated with Ramipril and&#xD;
      corticosteroids (experimental arm) 1.2±1.0 g/24 hours. Based on these assumptions, we&#xD;
      calculated a sample size of 132 patients (66 patients per group including a 10% dropout rate)&#xD;
      for a power of 90%, a two-sided significance level of 0.05 and 3 years of recruitment. If the&#xD;
      number of the enrolled patients will be insufficient, the recruitment period will be extended&#xD;
      for two years. At 6 months, all patients of the control arm who will display a 24 hour&#xD;
      proteinuria &gt;0.5g will be switched to the experimental treatment and will receive&#xD;
      corticosteroids for 3 months. They will be followed-up until the study termination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CHRONIgAN. Data from the literature suggest a difference of renal survival between SGLT2is&#xD;
      and controls. Here we assume a difference of 40% in the primary end point (i.e. in the&#xD;
      between-arms difference of delta 24 hour proteinuria from baseline to 6 months) as clinically&#xD;
      relevant. We assume that a mean delta proteinuria (±SD) from baseline to 6 months in patients&#xD;
      with Ramipril alone is 0.6±1.0 g/24 hours versus a mean delta proteinuria (±SD) from baseline&#xD;
      to 6 months in patients treated with SGLT-2 inhibitor and Ramipril (1.0±1.0 g/24 hours).&#xD;
      Based on these assumptions, we have calculated a sample size of 294 patients (147 patients&#xD;
      per group including a 10% dropout rate) for a power of 90%, a two-sided significance level of&#xD;
      0.05 and 3 years of recruitment. If the time-recruitment will be insufficient, the&#xD;
      recruitment period will be extended for two years. At 6 months, all patients of the control&#xD;
      arm who will display a 24 hour proteinuria &gt;0.5 g will be switched to the experimental&#xD;
      treatment (SGLT-2 inhibitor combined with Ramipril). They will be followed-up until the study&#xD;
      termination.&#xD;

    <description>Patients assigned to the corticosteroid group will receive (pulse) methylprednisolone succinate 500-1000 mg/day for 3 consecutive days followed by oral prednisolone (0.5 mg/kg/bw) on alternate days until the end of month. This treatment will be repeated for three consecutive months. In addition, patients will receive RASBs that will be titrated to their maximum anti-proteinuric effect. The dose of methylprednisolone succinate will be individualized (15 mg/kg) based on the ideal body weight. In overweight and obese IgAN patients the ideal body weight will be considered. The drug will be administered in a single daily dose intravenously for 30-60 min. To avoid obesity and diabetes corticosteroids will be administered only in the morning.</description>
