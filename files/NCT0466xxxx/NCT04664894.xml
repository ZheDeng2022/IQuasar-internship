      The objective of the study is to determine the safety of DAA's among chronic HCV patients.&#xD;
      The outcomes of the study are; To determine the frequency of adverse events while receiving&#xD;
      DAAs with or without RBV and/or Pegylated Interferon To calculate the percentage of patients&#xD;
      with severity of medical event as per Karch and Lasagna classification To determine the&#xD;
      percentage of patient having serious adverse event as per ICH Classification&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The cross sectional survey data will be collected on a pre-defined questionnaire from&#xD;
      Gastroenterologist and Hepatologist. The questionnaire will provide us information on&#xD;
      demographics, relevant patient history, concomitant medication, ongoing treatment plan&#xD;
      recommended for chronic HCV and adverse event details.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questions related to Pharmacovigilance and safety assessment includes the International&#xD;
      Nonproprietary Names (INN) unless it is prescribed brand of Getz Pharma. All adverse events&#xD;
      associated with the prescribed treatment will be recorded. Data on outcome assessment will be&#xD;
      based on action taken due to AE and other reported details. Seriousness of adverse event will&#xD;
      also be recorded as per the ICH classification and severity of medical event will be assessed&#xD;
      as per Karch and Lasagna classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the information will be recorded by the healthcare professionals on the questionnaire&#xD;
      during direct interaction with the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' written authorization to use and/or disclose the patient's personal and/or health&#xD;
      data will be obtained. However, patient data secrecy will follow ICH GCP requirements.&#xD;
