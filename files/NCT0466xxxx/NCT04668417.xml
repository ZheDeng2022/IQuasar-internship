  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is taking place in Los Angeles, CA among patients from primary care practices&#xD;
      within the UCLA Health System.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is a parallel 2-arm trial. The parallel arms are 1) a reminder letter for&#xD;
      the second dose of influenza vaccine (reminder messages sent via the patient portal) with a&#xD;
      direct appointment scheduling link included in the reminder and 2) a reminder letter for the&#xD;
      second dose of influenza vaccine, but no direct appointment scheduling link included.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This trial is taking place in Los Angeles, CA among patients from primary care practices&#xD;
      within the UCLA Health System, using a parallel 2-arm trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-optimal vaccination rates are a significant problem in the U.S., despite their&#xD;
      effectiveness in preventing morbidity and mortality from vaccine-preventable illness. In the&#xD;
      U.S., annual epidemics of influenza cause substantial morbidity in the U.S. with up to&#xD;
      40,00-80,000 deaths/year and many hospitalizations, emergency and outpatient visits, and&#xD;
      significant costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Young children-especially those younger than 2- are at high risk of developing serious&#xD;
      flu-related complications. Children ages of 6 months to 8 years getting vaccinated for the&#xD;
      first time with influenza vaccine should get two doses, and those who have only previously&#xD;
      gotten one dose of influenza vaccine, should get a second dose (spaced at least 4 weeks&#xD;
      apart).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reminder/recall (R/R) messages, sent by phone, mail or other modality, can improve child&#xD;
      vaccination rates. However, the majority of pediatric or adult primary care practices to not&#xD;
      conduct R/R. Barriers are lack of finances, personnel, and algorithms to identify eligible&#xD;
      patients. A technological breakthrough that might overcome these barriers involves patient&#xD;
      portals-- secure, web-based communication systems, embedded within electronic health records&#xD;
      (EHRs), for patients and providers to communicate with each other via email and the internet.&#xD;
      Portals are increasingly used by healthcare systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized controlled trial will assess the effectiveness of reminders messages, sent to&#xD;
      the proxy of pediatric patients ages 6 months to &lt;36 months of age eligible for a second dose&#xD;
      of the influenza vaccine based on data in the EHR. Patients will be randomized into one of&#xD;
      two arms to receive 1) a reminder letter for a second dose of influenza vaccine, with a&#xD;
      direct appointment scheduling link included in the letter or 2) a reminder letter for a&#xD;
      second dose of influenza vaccine, without a direct appointment scheduling link included in&#xD;
      the letter.&#xD;

Outcomes will be assessed via vaccine data extraction from the electronic health record and external claims and pharmacy data. The patient must also be an active UCLA Health MyChart user (&gt;= 1 login over the last 12 months from 12/15/2020), excluding activity on the user's initial profile activation date. Individuals not affiliated with any primary care practice will be excluded from the analysis.</description>
