    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate if traumatic intracranial hemorrhage can be safely ruled out by&#xD;
      using a microwave scanner (MD100) in conjunction with a combination of different brain&#xD;
      biomarkers analyzed in serum.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open, multicentre trial that will enrol patients presenting to the&#xD;
      Emergency Department (ED) because of isolated head trauma or head trauma as part of a multi&#xD;
      trauma. Microwave scanning characteristics and biomarkers in patients with traumatic&#xD;
      intracranial haemorrhage (TICH) (Group A) will be compared to patients with head trauma that&#xD;
      do not have TICH (Group B). All adult patients with trauma to the head will be eligible for&#xD;
      inclusion if a medical professional has evaluated the risk of spine injury. After additional&#xD;
      physical examination, control of inclusion- and exclusion criteria and after informed consent&#xD;
      has been acquired, the microwave measurement and blood sampling will be performed. Before&#xD;
      enrolment in the study, and in the acute phase, one of the investigators or a member of the&#xD;
      investigator staff must explain verbally the implications of study participation to the&#xD;
      patient, and the patient is asked to give a verbal consent. As soon as is practically&#xD;
      possible after the acute phase of the disease, the patient will sign and personally date the&#xD;
      informed consent form. In cases where the patient is not capable to read and/or sign the&#xD;
      informed consent, due to disability, an independent witness shall be present throughout the&#xD;
      process of reading the written informed consent and any other information aloud and explained&#xD;
      to the prospective patient. As an independent witness, healthcare professionals who are not&#xD;
      responsible or in any way involved in the patient's care or treatment are accepted. The&#xD;
      independent witness can sign on the behalf of the patient in the presence of the patient and&#xD;
      the Investigator. More details of the informed consent procedure are described in this&#xD;
      Clinical Investigation Plan, section 6.3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The microwave measurement will take less than five minutes (the duration of the actual&#xD;
      measurement is about 1,5 min and will not interfere with the patient's standard of care). The&#xD;
      Research Nurse or the Investigator documents all patient clinical trial information in the&#xD;
      eCRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and usability will be evaluated throughout the trial, and a safety follow-up will be&#xD;
      performed by the Research Nurse or Investigator approximately 24 hours after the measurement&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the data processing phase of study, the result of the microwave measurement will be&#xD;
      compared to the result of the biomarkers, CT examination and the patient's final diagnosis.&#xD;
      As a control group, approximately 50 demographically matched healthy volunteers (Group C)&#xD;
      will be asked to participate in the trial. The trial will provide knowledge of the predictive&#xD;
      value of microwave measurement and biomarkers for the diagnosis of intracranial haemorrhages&#xD;
      in the acute TBI phase.&#xD;
