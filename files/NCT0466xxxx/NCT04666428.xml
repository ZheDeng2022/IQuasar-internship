    <textblock>
      This trial studies the effects of human papillomavirus diagnosis on the relationships of&#xD;
      patients with head and neck cancer. Determining the effects of human papillomavirus diagnosis&#xD;
      on relationships may determine whether human papillomavirus-positive patients and their&#xD;
      partners are more likely to experience decline in relationship intimacy after diagnosis than&#xD;
      human papillomavirus-negative patients and their partners. This may help researchers provide&#xD;
      valuable insight into the degree to which a diagnosis of human papillomavirus affects patient&#xD;
      relationships over and above the effects of a cancer diagnosis and address the need for&#xD;
      additional patient counseling or education following diagnosis.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To explore the agreement between patients' perceived intimacy level and their partners'&#xD;
      perceived intimacy level at different time points in the course of their head and neck cancer&#xD;
      (HNC) treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To compare any changes in the patients' perceived intimacy scores between human&#xD;
      papillomavirus (HPV)-positive and HPV-negative HNC patients at different time points in the&#xD;
      course of their HNC treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Identify areas of concern or misinformation among patients and partners where further&#xD;
      patient counseling or education may be indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and partners complete surveys over 10 minutes prior to surgery and 3-6 months after&#xD;
      completion of treatment.&#xD;
