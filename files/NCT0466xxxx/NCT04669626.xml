  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malodours are a common complication of chronic wounds. They are the result of the&#xD;
      proliferation of aerobic and anaerobic micro-organisms on the wound surface, where they&#xD;
      metabolize healthy tissue which leads to the production of sloughy and even necrotic tissue.&#xD;
      Wound odour has a big impact on the quality of life of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently the standard of care for the management of malodourous wounds are systemic&#xD;
      antibiotics, absorbent wound dressings with or without activated carbon and, topical&#xD;
      antimicrobials. The application of topical antimicrobials such as antiseptics against wound&#xD;
      odour is part of the standard care. One suggested antiseptic in a recent published standard&#xD;
      is Octenilin®. There is ample anecdotal evidence about the efficacy of Octenilin® in reducing&#xD;
      wound odour. Therefore, we propose here to document this ability by evaluating the odour of&#xD;
      wounds washed with Octenilin® versus standard care (NaCl 0.9% solution).&#xD;

      Malodours are a common complication of chronic wounds. They are the result of the&#xD;
      proliferation of aerobic and anaerobic micro-organisms on the wound surface, where they&#xD;
      metabolize healthy tissue which leads to the production of sloughy and even necrotic tissue.&#xD;
      Wound odour has a big impact on the quality of life of patients. Patients describe living&#xD;
      with a chronic malodourous wound as devastating particularly in respect to social&#xD;
      interaction. The key to addressing the negative consequences of malodorous and/or discharging&#xD;
      wounds is an effective wound managements plan based on accurate and holistic assessment of&#xD;
      the patient and the wound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently the standard of care for the management of malodourous wounds are systemic&#xD;
      antibiotics, absorbent wound dressings with or without activated carbon and, topical&#xD;
      antimicrobials. The application of topical antimicrobials such as antiseptics against wound&#xD;
      odour is part of the standard care. One suggested antiseptic in a recent published standard&#xD;
      is Octenilin®. Octenilin® wound cleansing solution is on the Swiss market since 2006 and is&#xD;
      routinely used in outpatient wound care centers. It exhibits good performance in the&#xD;
      reduction of biofilm's pathogens and has excellent moisturizing properties. While there is&#xD;
      ample anecdotal evidence about the efficacy of Octenilin® in reducing wound odour, we propose&#xD;
      here to document this ability by evaluating the odour of wounds washed with Octenilin® versus&#xD;
      standard care (NaCl 0.9% solution).&#xD;
