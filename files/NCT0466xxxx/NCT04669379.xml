  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recovery after the surgery depends on psychological factors such as preoperative information,&#xD;
      expectations, and surgery-associated anxiety. Prior studies have shown that even short&#xD;
      preoperative psychological interventions can improve postoperative outcomes. However, the&#xD;
      content of these interventions needs further examination. This study aims to examine if the&#xD;
      developed preoperative intervention (i) reduces preoperative anxiety, (ii) increases positive&#xD;
      expectations, and (iii) improves the long-term outcome and postoperative recovery. Therefore&#xD;
      an online-tool has been developed. Using an online-approach makes it possible to reach many&#xD;
      patients taking as little time and cost as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who undergo surgery in the next two weeks and want to participate in the study will&#xD;
      be asked for the planned surgical procedure. There will be a filter (stratum) for surgery.&#xD;
      Patients with the same kind of surgery are randomized into two groups (Control vs.&#xD;
      intervention group) after they've filled some questionnaires at the baseline assessment.&#xD;
      Following this, the intervention group will participate in the psychological online&#xD;
      intervention (around 30 minutes). The intervention will focus on the treatment outcome&#xD;
      expectations and personal control expectations to increase patients' positive expectations.&#xD;
      The control group will receive no psychological intervention. Both groups will fill out&#xD;
      questionnaires again in the evening, two days before the surgery, around one week after the&#xD;
      surgery, and three months after the surgery.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline, up to one week post-surgery, up to three months post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Items range from 0 (no disability at all) - 10 (total disability). Consequently higher scores mean a worse outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in The Amsterdam Preoperative Anxiety and Information Scale (APAIS) from Baseline to two days pre-surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, two days pre-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Items range from 1 (not at all) - 5 (extremely). Higher scores mean patients are more interested in information and do have greater worries</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, up to one week post-surgery, up to three months post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>There are different item scales. The item scale of the first item (General health perceptions) ranges from 1 (excellent)to 5 (bad). The item scales of the second and third item (limitations in physical activities because of health problems)range from 1 (yes, absolutely restricted) to 2 (yes, a bit restricted) to 3 (no, not restricted at all). The item scales of the items 4-7 (limitations in usual role activities because of physical health or emotional problems) are just &quot;yes&quot; and&quot;no&quot;. The item scale of the eighth item (bodily pain) ranges from 1 (Absolutely not) to 5 (a lot). The item scales of the items 9-12 (general mental health, vitality and limitations in social activities because of physical or emotional problems)range from 1 (always) to 5 (never).</description>
