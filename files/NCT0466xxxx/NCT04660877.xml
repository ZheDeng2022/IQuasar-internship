      The goal of this project is to use a cross over design in young healthy male and female&#xD;
      adults:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the amino acid blood response to the acute ingestion of cheddar cheese in&#xD;
           comparison to that of milk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the muscle mTORC1 response to the acute ingestion of cheddar cheese in&#xD;
           comparison to that of milk.&#xD;

      Each subject will take part in two metabolic studies. Each metabolic study was designed to&#xD;
      test the acute blood and muscle response to an ingested amount of either cheddar cheese or&#xD;
      milk. Approximately, one month after the first experiment (Metabolic Study #1), the&#xD;
      participant will complete the second experiment (Metabolic Study #2) which was exact in&#xD;
      design and at the same time of day as the first study but the participant ingested the&#xD;
      alternate food product. The morning of the metabolic studies, the participant will arrive at&#xD;
      the clinical research center after a 10h fast. A catheter will be placed in the participants'&#xD;
      arm for blood sampling. Next, the participant will undergo a fasted thigh skeletal muscle&#xD;
      biopsy. Following the muscle biopsy, the participant will consume either cheddar cheese (65g)&#xD;
      or milk (370 mL) each amounting to 20g of protein. Subsequent muscle biopsies will occur at&#xD;
      60 and 180min after product ingestion. Blood sampling will occur in the fasted state and&#xD;
      periodically after ingestion of the products (up to 300min).&#xD;
