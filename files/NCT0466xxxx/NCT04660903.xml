    <textblock>
      This is a prospective interventional study on the treatment of transsphincteric fistula in&#xD;
      ano. After abdominal or thigh liposuction, fat was injected around the fistula tract that was&#xD;
      then transected percutaneously with a sharp cannula and fat injected between and around the&#xD;
      cut parts. The internal opening was closed with a suture. Minimum follow up of 12 months is&#xD;
      planed&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is intended to be carried out at the Department of Surgery of Uppsala University&#xD;
      Hospital, as a single-center study. All (consecutive) otherwise healthy patients between the&#xD;
      ages of 18-70 who have been diagnosed with perianal fistula where attempts to close the&#xD;
      fistula is considered appropriate are asked to participate. This is done by the examining&#xD;
      physician at their visit at the outpatient clinic. These are either patients who already have&#xD;
      a relieving seton or those who need to be revised and treated with a seton before final&#xD;
      closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They receive written information about the study plan and have time to think about it. If&#xD;
      they choose to participate in the study, they are planed for a visit to one of the surgeons&#xD;
      involved in the study and here get another opportunity to ask questions and then also sign an&#xD;
      informed consent. This step can be adjusted as telephone contact due to the Covid-19&#xD;
      pandemic. Thereafter, they are included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants are operated on only by the surgeons involved, all of whom have undergone&#xD;
      practical training in how fat cell transplantation is carried out according to the&#xD;
      standardized Coleman method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure itself then takes place as a day surgery operation at the Samariter Hemmet (&#xD;
      part of the Surgical Department, Uppsala University Hospital ) operating department and&#xD;
      either as a one- or two-step procedure, depending on whether they have a relieving seton or&#xD;
      not. The seton has to be placed sometime before the definitive fatty tissue procedure so that&#xD;
      there is no sign of inflammation/infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 3- and 12-months follow up visit is then arranged. In these visits, the patients are&#xD;
      examined for evaluation of the result, possible residual fistulas, and complications. Wexner&#xD;
      score and VAS scale are filed in and saved in their patient files.&#xD;
