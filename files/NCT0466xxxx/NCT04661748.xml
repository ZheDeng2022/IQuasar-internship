  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the current study is to assess the effect of continuous wireless vital&#xD;
      signs monitoring with generation of real-time alerts compared to blinded monitoring without&#xD;
      alerts on the cumulative duration of any severely deviating vital signs in patients admitted&#xD;
      to general hospital wards with acute medical conditions. Patients admitted with medical&#xD;
      conditions represents a large and heterogenous group occupying a substantial part of the&#xD;
      total in-patient capacity in the Danish hospitals today. The hypothesize is that continuous&#xD;
      vital signs monitoring, and real-time alerts will reduce the cumulative duration of severely&#xD;
      deviating vital signs.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Deterioration of patients on general hospital wards often goes unnoticed for prolonged&#xD;
      periods of time. This delay can potentially result in severe adverse outcomes such as&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary arrest and need for admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). These&#xD;
      complications occur despite the fact that, in most cases, measurable changes in physiological&#xD;
      vital signs, could identify patients at risk. Moreover, occurrence of complications increase&#xD;
      treatment costs considerably underpinning the rationale of early detection of patient&#xD;
      deterioration in both human and economic terms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring of vital signs outside of ICU or telemetry units usually relies on intermittent&#xD;
      manual assessments performed by clinical staff at intervals of up to 12 hours with the &quot;Early&#xD;
      Warning Score (EWS)&quot;, &quot;Tidlig Opsporing af Kritisk Sygdom (TOKS)&quot; or similar systems.&#xD;
      However, significant deterioration may occur in-between these intervals, which may explain&#xD;
      the EWS/TOKS score's proven lack of impact on morbidity and mortality in Danish hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent medico-technical advances have allowed for clinical use of small wireless&#xD;
      wear-and-forget devices that continuously monitor various indices of cardiopulmonary status,&#xD;
      ambulatory activity, temperature etc. Studies suggest that integration of continuous&#xD;
      monitoring into automated patient surveillance systems more often detects cardiorespiratory&#xD;
      instability and may decrease number of Emergency Response Team activations, ICU transfers,&#xD;
      length of hospital stay, morbidity and mortality but further randomized controlled trials&#xD;
      (RCTs) are needed to confirm this. Other advantages may be a decrease in the time required&#xD;
      for vital signs measurement and recording compared to routine monitoring and overall health&#xD;
      care cost savings with return-on-investment estimates ranging from 127%-1739%.&#xD;
