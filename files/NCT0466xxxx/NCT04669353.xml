      Objective: To assess the effect of autologous Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) on wound healing and&#xD;
      pain perception in high risk women undergoing cesarean sections in a low resource setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This was a randomized controlled trial of 200 women who attended the outpatient&#xD;
      clinic of Menoufia University Hospital for elective cesarean surgery. The women were randomly&#xD;
      assigned to two groups. The intervention group received PRP after surgery, whereas the&#xD;
      control group received the usual care. Outcomes included Redness, Edema, Ecchymosis,&#xD;
      Discharge, Approximation (REEDA) scale, Vancouver scar scale (VSS), and the visual analog&#xD;
      scale (VAS).&#xD;

      The investigators conducted this randomized controlled trial from April 2018 to July 2020 at&#xD;
      the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Menoufia University Hospital, which is a large&#xD;
      tertiary center in the Delta region in Egypt with a delivery rate of about 10000 per year.&#xD;
      This study was approved by Menoufia university hospital ethical committee Institutional&#xD;
      review board (198190PSGN33). The investigators obtained informed consent from all&#xD;
      participants before initiating any study procedures. CONSORT guidelines were observed and&#xD;
      completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients included in the study were between 20 and 40 years of age. Eligible women had&#xD;
      one or more of the following risk factors: Body mass index (BMI) &gt; 30 kglcm2, prior cesarean&#xD;
      section, pregestational or gestational diabetes, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy,&#xD;
      placenta Previa, twin pregnancy, anemia, and corticosteroid medication. Exclusion criteria&#xD;
      were chronic pain disorders, hepatitis, thrombocytopenia, and coagulation disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators randomized participants in a 1:1 ratio to two equal groups containing one&#xD;
      hundred patients each (intervention and control groups). A statistician not directly involved&#xD;
      in the study prepared a computer generated randomization list and placed the allocation&#xD;
      information in sequentially numbered sealed envelopes that were opened according to the&#xD;
      attendance of the patients after signing the informed consent. The study authors were unaware&#xD;
      of the envelope allocation sequence. Participants and outcome assessors did not know which&#xD;
      group had been assigned to for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the operating room before the start of each procedure, approximately 15 cm of whole blood&#xD;
      was drawn from the uninvolved arm of each patient in the intervention group (group I) into a&#xD;
      20 ml sterile syringe containing citrate for anticoagulation. The blood was immediately&#xD;
      centrifuged at 3200 Revolutions per Minute (PRM). Following 15 minutes of centrifugation, 4 -&#xD;
      5 mL of PRP was obtained. Then, the PRP was buffered by using sodium bicarbonate. After&#xD;
      closure of the fascia and prior to skin closure, PRP was directly applied to the subcutaneous&#xD;
      tissue of the wound site by using a sterile syringe. In the control group (group II), the&#xD;
      patients did not receive topical treatment and the subcutaneous tissue was cleaned with&#xD;
      normal saline before skin closure. For all patients, the skin was closed with polyprolene 2-0&#xD;
      suture with a curved cutting needle. The patients were examined by the physicians who were&#xD;
      blinded to the group allocation on day 1, and then day 7 and 6 months after the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain was evaluated by the visual analog scale system (VAS) which assesses changes of pain via&#xD;
      a continuous measurement instrument that is operationally comprised of a horizontal line,&#xD;
      anchored at each end by verbal descriptors such as no pain and the worst pain imaginable. The&#xD;
      subject is asked to indicate a spot on the scale that best represents her degree of pain. The&#xD;
      score is determined by measuring the distance (mm) between the no pain anchor to the point&#xD;
      that the patient marks, providing a range of scores from 0 - 10. A higher score indicates&#xD;
      greater pain intensity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome was the Redness, Edema, Ecchymosis, Discharge, Approximation (REEDA)&#xD;
      scale for assessing the changes in wound healing. REEDA as a descriptive scale has 4 points&#xD;
      in a categorical score that measures 5 items of healing: redness (hyperemia), edema,&#xD;
      ecchymosis, discharge, and approximation of the wound edges (coaptation). Each item is rated&#xD;
      on a scale of 0 to 3, and total scores may range from 0 to 15. A lower score indicates better&#xD;
      healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcomes were measured by Vancouver scar scale (VSS) and VAS. VSS use to detect&#xD;
      changes of formation of keloids or hypertrophic scars. It assesses 4 subjective variables:&#xD;
      vascularity, height/thickness, pliability, and pigmentation within a possible range of 0 - 14&#xD;
      for the total score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was calculated by using Epi-Info program version 3.5.4 by adjusting&#xD;
      confidence interval to 95%. With an alpha error of 5% and study power of 80% and assuming a&#xD;
      clinically relevant reduction in REEDA and VSS scores based on results of previous studies,&#xD;
      the invesigators estimated a total sample size of 182 women (91 for each group). This was&#xD;
      increased to 200 women considering about 10% drop out rate. The data collected, were&#xD;
      tabulated and analyzed by SPSS (statistical package for the social science software)&#xD;
      statistical package version 20 (Chicago Inc., USA), the following tests were used;&#xD;
      Quantitative data were expressed as mean and standard deviation (X ± SD) and analyzed by&#xD;
      applying student t test. Qualitative data were analyzed by Chi Square test. P-value at 0.05&#xD;
      was used to determine significance regarded as non-significant P&gt; 0.05, significant P≤ 0.05&#xD;
      or highly significant P≤ 0.001.&#xD;
