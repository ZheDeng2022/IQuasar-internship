      the treatment of Multiple Sclerosis. This study will be for 24 subjects with 6 infusions over&#xD;
      a 52 week period. Study participants will continue their established concomitant medications&#xD;
      during participation in this investigation.&#xD;

      Each eligible study subject will receive a total of 6 intravenous infusions of HB-adMSCs or&#xD;
      placebo. Study infusions will be administered with the following regimen, Week 0, 4, 8, 16,&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To investigate the efficacy of intravenous infusions of HB-adMSCs vs placebo in patients with Multiple Sclerosis as determined by improvements in the Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life (MSQOL) 54 Instrument.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The MSQOL-54 is a comprehensive health-related quality of life measure incorporating general and MS-specific questions into a single instrument.&#xD;
The developers used the SF-36 as a base and added 18 questions to address MS-specific problems, including fatigue and cognitive function.&#xD;
This 54-item questionnaire provides 12 sub-scales, two summary scores, and two extra single-item measures. The sub-scales are physical function, role limits-physical, emotional role restrictions, pain, emotional well-being, energy, health perceptions, social position, cognitive function, health distress, overall quality of life, and sexual function. There is no single overall score for MSQOL-54. Two summary scores - physical health and mental health - can be derived from a weighted combination of scale scores (scale scores range from 0 to 100 and a higher scale score indicates improved quality of life).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate the efficacy of intravenous infusions of HB-adMSCs vs placebo in patients with Multiple Sclerosis as determined by changes in the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The EDSS is a method of quantifying disability in multiple sclerosis and monitoring changes in the level of disability over time. This scale ranges from 0 to 10 in 0.5-unit increments that represent higher levels of disability. Scoring is based on an examination by a neurologist.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate the efficacy of intravenous infusions of HB-adMSCs vs placebo in patients with Multiple Sclerosis as determined by changes in the Barthel Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The Barthel index is an ordinal scale that evaluates functional independence in the domains of personal care and mobility. A total of ten variables describing activities of daily living and mobility are considered, with a higher number reflecting better capacity to operate independently. The Barthel Index assesses the level of help needed by a person on a set of ten activities of daily living (ADL) related to mobility and self-care.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To determine the efficacy of intravenous infusions of HB-adMSCs vs. Placebo in patients with Multiple Sclerosis as determined by changes in 9-Hole Peg Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The 9-HPT is a short, standardized upper extremity exam. It measures the time taken to complete the test activity, recorded in seconds. The higher the score the worse the disability.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To identify the safety of intravenous infusions of HB-adMSCs vs. Placebo in patients with Multiple Sclerosis as determined by changes in Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-9 is the most used depression and suicidal thoughts screening test used to monitor the severity of depression and response to treatment.&#xD;
Depression Severity: 0-4 none, 5-9 mild, 10-14 moderate, 15-19 moderately severe, 20-27 severe.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess the safety of intravenous infusions of HB-adMSCs vs. Placebo in patients with Multiple Sclerosis as determined by the incidence of adverse events or serious adverse events</measure>
