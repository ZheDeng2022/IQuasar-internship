    <textblock>
      Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory&#xD;
&#xD;
      disease that involves different organs and systems. The heterogeneous nature of&#xD;
&#xD;
      the disease represents a great challenge in its diagnosis and management.1 Studies&#xD;
&#xD;
      reported that the percentage of SLE patients demonstrating ocular manifestations&#xD;
&#xD;
      can reach up to 30%.2&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathogenesis of the ocular involvement is still unclear, but immune&#xD;
&#xD;
      complex vasculopathy and inflammatory mediators might be implicated. The most&#xD;
&#xD;
      common ocular manifestation in SLE was found to be kerato-conjunctivitis&#xD;
&#xD;
      sicca(KCS) followed by retinopathy, where is the most severe manifestation was&#xD;
&#xD;
      the optic nerve involvement, which might end up with irreversible blindness while&#xD;
&#xD;
      anterior uveitis is a rare manifestation in SLE.3&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retinal involvement can vary from subclinical vascular changes to vaso-&#xD;
&#xD;
      occlusive vision-threatening retinopathy. Lupus retinopathy is secondary to IgG&#xD;
&#xD;
      complex-mediated micro-angiopathy that leads to small vessels infarcts. Currently,&#xD;
&#xD;
      there is no agreement on existing biomarkers to identify SLE patients who have&#xD;
&#xD;
      subclinical retinal involvement, or to identify whether micro-vascular changes in&#xD;
&#xD;
      the retina are attributable to SLE.4 Lupus retinopathy is usually associated with&#xD;
&#xD;
      high disease activity especially nephritis and cerebritis. 5&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other side, hydroxychloroquine,(HCQ) a cornerstone in lupus treatment, rarely causes&#xD;
      ocular toxicity at doses of less than 6.5 mg/kg per day. Moreover, HCQ is found to be&#xD;
      associated with retinopathy after a prolonged time of treatment (&gt;5 years). 6 HCQ bind to&#xD;
      melanin pigments in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). This binding may serve to&#xD;
      concentrate the agents in the cell and contribute to their long-term effects. The classic&#xD;
      pattern of retinal toxicity of HCQ is RPE depigmentation with foveal sparing, known as&#xD;
      bull's-eye maculopathy. Although visual acuity in these patients seems intact, patients&#xD;
      complain from paracentral scotomas associated with reading difficulties. Besides, reduced&#xD;
      color perception can be seen as retinopathy symptoms. That is why it is important to evaluate&#xD;
      the eyes before starting therapy and during follow-up visits. 7 To diagnose HCQ-induced&#xD;
      retinopathy, various methods have been recommended, including: Spectral Domain Optical&#xD;
      Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT), automated perimetry test, multifocal electroretinogram&#xD;
      (mfERG), But it is controversial as to which of these methods is the Gold Standard early&#xD;
      detection of HCQ-induced retinopathy. So it's important to find a tool that can help us&#xD;
      diagnose early. 8 mfERG is highly sensitive among the mentioned tests and because it is an&#xD;
      objective test, it is less dependent on the patient's response and cooperation .The mfERG&#xD;
      objectively evaluates the electroretinographic response of the macular region, and in HCQ&#xD;
      retinopathy, this response is reduced in the paracentral region&#xD;
