    <textblock>
      The study main objective will be to compare measurements of heart rate, respiration rate,&#xD;
      blood pressure and movement done by LYNG by Ably Medical with the corresponding measurements&#xD;
      made by standard equipment in a patient sample in a hospital setting. The comparison will&#xD;
      show the degree of agreement between LYNG and the existing current standard equipment. Data&#xD;
      from the study will support Ably Medical in optimizing the LYNG product and measurement&#xD;
      precision.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The LYNG sensor mat is placed beneath a regular bed matrass and captures data without direct&#xD;
      patient contact. Data collected by the LYNG sensor is transmitted via cables to the bed-side&#xD;
      connectivity box for initial local analysis and storage. Data will be extracted and formatted&#xD;
      for post-analysis in additional software for verification and validation purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, the LYNG study objectives are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. collect sensor data from LYNG Solution to optimize the LYNG data algorithms to further&#xD;
           improve parameter estimations of patient heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure&#xD;
           and movement indicators.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compare parameter estimation by LYNG against current and relevant standard of care&#xD;
           measurement methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is a within-subjects comparison in parameter estimation with Ably LYNG as&#xD;
      comparator to standard of care. Patients will take part in 60-minute sessions where&#xD;
      measurements are collected in accidence to standard procedure for the standard equipment&#xD;
      while the LYNG system collects the same data non- intrusively. The data will not be part of&#xD;
      any clinical decision making or have any impact of the patient care. The study will take&#xD;
      place during Q2-Q3/2021 with estimated 8-12 weeks duration including logistics, setup, data&#xD;
      collection, study closure.&#xD;
