  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to prospectively document changes in FEV1 and health-related quality&#xD;
      of life 12 months following sequential segmental treatment with InterVapor® in patients with&#xD;
      heterogeneous emphysema with upper lobe predominance. For validity of the study, the results&#xD;
      will be compared to patients that receive optimal medical therapy.&#xD;

      The primary objectives are to prospectively document changes in FEV1 and health-related&#xD;
      quality of life 12 months following sequential segmental treatment with Bronchoscopic Thermal&#xD;
      Vapor Ablation (BTVA) using the InterVapor system in patients with heterogeneous emphysema&#xD;
      with upper lobe predominance. The French TARGET trial is a prospective, multi-center, single&#xD;
      blind, randomized controlled study. 150 participants will be enrolled in the study (1:1&#xD;
      randomization with 75 InterVapor, 75 controls) with a 12-month follow-up period. Subjects&#xD;
      randomized to the Control Group may be allowed to cross over to the treatment group and&#xD;
      offered the InterVapor treatment once they have completed the protocol defined follow-up&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
