      The influence of age and physical fitness level on the level of energy metabolism and&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over four hundred healthy, adult males of different age categories and physical fitness&#xD;
      levels were included in the study. There is much research convincing that in athletes of&#xD;
      various sports disciplines the level of energy metabolism, oxidative stress, and amino acid&#xD;
      profiles during years of training undergoes sports adaptation. The study aimed to evaluate&#xD;
      how age and physical fitness level affects the level of purine metabolites and metabolites of&#xD;
      nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, the level of antioxidant capacity, and amino acid&#xD;
      profiles. Investigators hypothesized that there will be an age-related decline in most of the&#xD;
      physiological indices, but significant differences will appear regarding the level of an&#xD;
      individual's sports adaptation.&#xD;

    <description>An incremental running test was conducted on the treadmill. Initially, the exercise protocol included standing still for 3 min and walking for 3 min at a constant speed of 4 km/h. After this introductory part, the speed was increased to 8 km/h and then every 3 min by 2 km/h until the volitional exhaustion was reached. During all procedure oxygen consumption was measured with the use of a portable breath-by-breath ergospirometer.</description>
