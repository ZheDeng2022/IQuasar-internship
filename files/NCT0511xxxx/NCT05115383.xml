  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The SARS-COV-2 virus uses a molecule on the surface of the cell to invade it and use its&#xD;
      internal mechanisms to reproduce. Once the virus is inside, the cell significantly decreases&#xD;
      the amount of ACE2 that it produces. ACE2 is part of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS),&#xD;
      which is involved in maintaining blood flow and electrolyte balance. It has been shown in&#xD;
      obese and hypertensive individuals that levels of another molecule ACE are much higher,&#xD;
      leading to inflammation, fibrosis, vasoconstriction and high blood pressure. ACE2 has a&#xD;
      protective effect from ACE, leading to anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic and vasodilating&#xD;
      effects. After infection with the virus, the body produces too much ACE and not enough ACE2&#xD;
      leading to complications or morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In animal models, it has been shown that aerobic exercise can increase levels of ACE2, while&#xD;
      decreasing levels of ACE and offers protection to the cardiovascular system by keeping these&#xD;
      two molecules balanced. In infected individuals with SARS-COV-2, it is possible that aerobic&#xD;
      exercise could be used to protect individuals from the long term effects of the virus and&#xD;
      lower the chance of future complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the effects of exercise on the RAS have been studied significantly, ACE2 is a&#xD;
      relatively new discovery and has not been studied as extensively in humans. The purpose of&#xD;
      this research is to determine the effects of aerobic exercise on the RAS, specifically on&#xD;
      ACE2 and its products to determine if it could be used as a potential treatment for&#xD;
      individuals infected with the SARS-COV-2 virus or reduce their risk of severe complications&#xD;
      upon infection.&#xD;

      The design of the proposed study is an intervention study, where participants are selected&#xD;
      into either a physically active group or a sedentary group. The physically active group will&#xD;
      be set as our control, as the physiological stress of the exercise protocol should be lower&#xD;
      in the physically active group and limit the magnitude of the response. Both groups will be&#xD;
      exposed to the same experimental procedure. Participants will be placed in their group based&#xD;
      on their responses to the CSEP Get Active questionnaire. Individuals who do not accumulate&#xD;
      less than 75 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity a week will be placed in the&#xD;
      sedentary group, while those who accumulate more than 150 minutes will be placed in the&#xD;
      active group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be requires to keep a food log for 24 hours prior to the second session.&#xD;
      They will then be asked to mimic their dietary intake in the food log 24 hours prior to the&#xD;
      third session. Participants will be asked to avoid anti-Inflammatory medications, alcohol and&#xD;
      smoking 48 hours prior to any of the sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in both groups will undergo the same testing procedure. Tests will include&#xD;
      densitometry and a graded exercise test to measure maximum VO2 and associated parameters. Two&#xD;
      additional exercise sessions will be conducted, one at moderate intensity and another at high&#xD;
      intensity, and venipuncture (5 ml) will be performed before and after each of these two&#xD;
      sessions immediately and 30 and 60 minutes post. The proposed study is a 2x2x4 repeated&#xD;
      measures design, with analysis being conducted using a dependent groups ANOVA and Tukey's&#xD;
      post hoc testing.&#xD;
