      The study was conducted experimentally (prospective randomized single-blind clinical trial&#xD;
      model) to evaluate the effect of neurolinguistic programming (NLP) on fear of Covid-19 in&#xD;
      kidney transplant patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was carried out between June 2021 and October 2021. Personal Information Form and&#xD;
      Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) were used to collect data. The data obtained from the&#xD;
      research were evaluated with SPSS 25.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the calculation made using G*power 3.1 software, the sample size was determined&#xD;
      as 74 (each group 37) with an effect size of 0.80, a margin of error of 0co.05, a confidence&#xD;
      level of 0.95, and a population representation of 0.95. Simple random sampling method, one of&#xD;
      the probability sampling methods, was used to determine the participants. Single-group&#xD;
      columns between 1 and 300 were created using the Random Integer Generator method, which&#xD;
      located in the Numbers sub-heading of the random.org website for the participants who met the&#xD;
      sample selection criteria. Participants were randomly assigned to numbers 1 and 2,&#xD;
      considering the numbers 1 and 2 in the column. The number of the experimental or control&#xD;
      group was determined by drawing lots at the beginning of the research&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The population of the study consisted of patients who had kidney transplants in the hospital in question. The sample of the study was determined by power analysis. According to the calculation made using G*power 3.1 software, the sample size was determined as 74 (each group 37) with an effect size of 0.80, a margin of error of 0co.05, a confidence level of 0.95, and a population representation of 0.95.
