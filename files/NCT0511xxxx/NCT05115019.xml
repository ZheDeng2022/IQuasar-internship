  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of the RUTI® vaccine in achieving clinical&#xD;
      improvement of COVID-19 symptoms and to evaluate the safety of RUTI® in patients with&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 infection. The study will include a comparison between placebo and RUTI® vaccine&#xD;
      in a 1:1 design.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Once it has been confirmed that the patient meets the selection criteria, subjects will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to one of the two study groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Experimental group: Administration of RUTI®&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control group: Administration of Placebo (physiological serum)&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomization follows a 1:1 ratio. In this way, of the total of 550 subjects who intend&#xD;
      to be recruited for this study, 275 will receive the prophylactic treatment, and 275 will&#xD;
      receive the placebo treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neither patient nor the doctor will know if the subject is part of the experimental group or&#xD;
      the control group, that is to say, the treatment assignment is blind.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjets will receive just one inoculation of treatment (either RUTI® or Pacebo). The&#xD;
      standard treatment of COVID-19, if is necessary, will continue after RUTI® administration&#xD;
      according to the local guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the subjets will be followed for one month after the first day of RUTI® or Placebo&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
