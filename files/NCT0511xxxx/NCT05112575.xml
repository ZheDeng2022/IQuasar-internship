  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative imaging after neurosurgical intervention is usually performed in the first 72&#xD;
      hours after surgery. Postoperative radiological examinations in the first 72 hours provide&#xD;
      accurate assessment of postoperative resection status. On the other side is frequently&#xD;
      reported by patients that the earlier postoperative examinations after craniotomy for tumor&#xD;
      and vascular procedures are associated with distress, exertion, nausea, and pain. Therefore,&#xD;
      psychological and physical stress on the patient could be a potential disadvantage of earlier&#xD;
      (up to 36 hours postoperatively) follow-up. The goal of this study is to evaluate and&#xD;
      determine the optimal time frame for postoperative imaging with MRI and CT in terms of&#xD;
      medical and neuroradiological implications and patient's subjective stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of the study is the extent of subjective distress due to postoperative&#xD;
      MRI and CT monitoring in relation to the time interval after surgery Data will be&#xD;
      prospectively collected from all patients aged 18 to 80 years who receive postoperative MRI&#xD;
      or CT follow-up after craniotomy for resection of a cerebral tumor (benign and malignant) or&#xD;
      vascular surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study determines, whether a timing of postoperative imaging can improve patient&#xD;
      satisfaction and reduce pain, stress and discomfort caused by postoperative imaging. The&#xD;
      outcome corresponds to the value-based medicine approach of modern patient-centred medicine.&#xD;
      Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and electronic patient data will be&#xD;
      safely stored for 15 years.&#xD;

      Background and rationale Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after neurosurgical resection of a&#xD;
      cerebral tumor is usually performed in the first 72 hours after surgery. 1-4 Accurate&#xD;
      assessment of early postoperative resection status in brain tumors is mandatory for further&#xD;
      treatment planning, e.g., delineation of the radiation field in radiotherapy, or reoperation&#xD;
      for significant residual tumor. 5 Various MRI-sequences provide information on tumor size and&#xD;
      location, as well as additional insight into secondary phenomena such as edema, hemorrhage,&#xD;
      infarct, necrosis, and signs of increased intracranial pressure. 1, 3, 5, 6 The 72 hours'&#xD;
      time window is crucial for accurate assessment of resection status and is additionally used&#xD;
      for quality control of the neurosurgical procedure. 7 Postoperative MRI later than 72 hours&#xD;
      after surgery can lead to false positive contrast enhancement due to absorption of contrast&#xD;
      in the surgical area which can complicate the assessment of resection status. 1, 6&#xD;
      Postsurgical repair mechanisms at the resection site that result from hypervascularization&#xD;
      and disruption of blood-brain barrier are probably responsible for this delayed enhancement.&#xD;
      7 The potential advantages of early imaging (within 36 hours after surgery) are better&#xD;
      radiological assessment of the surgical site and earlier diagnosis of postoperative&#xD;
      complications, such as infarcts, postoperative bleeding or edema. This may help in improving&#xD;
      the postoperative management of patients with complications. Moreover, earlier information&#xD;
      about the outcome of surgery could also lead to psychological relief for patients in the&#xD;
      early postoperative period. Disadvantages of early postoperative examinations after&#xD;
      craniotomy are frequently reported by patients and include distress, exertion, nausea, and&#xD;
      pain during and after the examination. As such, psychological and physical patient stress&#xD;
      could be a potential disadvantage of early (within 36 hours after surgery) MRI examination.&#xD;
      An alternative image modality is Computed Tomography (CT), which may be less stressful for&#xD;
      the patients because it takes only 5 to 10 minutes to complete the scan and the patients do&#xD;
      not have to lie in small claustrophobic space compared to MRI. However, with this modality&#xD;
      the postoperative resection status cannot reliably be assessed. To the authors knowledge, no&#xD;
      previous literature has been published which addressed the stress factors during&#xD;
      postoperative imaging. To authors opinion, a more patient-centered view regarding&#xD;
      postoperative MRI investigation needs more clarification, so the authors want to investigate&#xD;
      the intensity of patient stress after postoperative imaging at different intervals from&#xD;
      surgery. With optimization of the time window of the MRI examination, the authors want to&#xD;
      improve the psychological and physical patient stress, which may have a positive influence on&#xD;
      early recovery. Additionally, establishing an optimal time window for postoperative MRI&#xD;
      imaging will help in scheduling the examination before the elective surgical treatment. This&#xD;
      will have a positive impact on preparing patients, radiology employees, nurses and physicians&#xD;
      for a smooth and easy transport to and from the MRI examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives The goal of this study is to assess whether early imaging with MRI (within 36&#xD;
      hours) after craniotomy is different regarding patient stress, than delayed imaging (between&#xD;
      36 and 72 hours). Secondly, the authors want to assess whether there is a difference in&#xD;
      patient stress level between postoperative MRI and CT within 72 hours postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The authors hypothesize that delayed imaging with MRI after craniotomy is more comfortable&#xD;
      for patients without negative implication of radiological assessment, than imaging within 36&#xD;
      hours. Secondly, the authors hypothesize that postoperative MRI is more stressful for&#xD;
      patients than CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial design The IPAST-CRANIO study (Evaluation of patient STress level caused by&#xD;
      radiological Investigations in early Postoperative phase After CRANIOtomy) is a&#xD;
      patient-oriented, prospective, exploratory cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Participants, interventions and outcomes Data will be collected from patients&#xD;
      between 18 and 80 years old who receive MRI or CT follow-up after craniotomy for resection of&#xD;
      a space occupying lesion (benign or malignant) or vascular procedure at the Department of&#xD;
      Neurosurgery at the University Hospital Zurich&#xD;
