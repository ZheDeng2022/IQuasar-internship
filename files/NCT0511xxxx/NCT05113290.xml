    <textblock>
      Sorafenib, as a first-line treatment for patients with advanced HCC, can significantly&#xD;
      prolong the overall survival rate of patients. However, about 53-71% of patients showed&#xD;
      stable disease (SD) after sorafenib treatment, and further studies to explore optimal therapy&#xD;
      for these patients are still needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oncolytic viruses are a type of virus that can selectively replicate in tumor cells and then&#xD;
      destroy tumor cells, of which recombinant human adenovirus type 5 (H101) is the first&#xD;
      oncolytic virus drug which was approved in the world. Recent studies indicate that H101 shows&#xD;
      anti-tumor effects on liver cancer and there may be a synergistic effect between recombinant&#xD;
      human adenovirus type 5 and sorafenib in the inhabitation of hepatoma cells in vitro. This&#xD;
      study aims to further verify the effect and safety of recombinant human adenovirus type 5&#xD;
      combined with sorafenib in the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary liver cancer is the fourth most common malignant tumor and the second most lethal&#xD;
      cause of tumor in China, mainly including Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and Intrahepatic&#xD;
      Cholangiocarcinoma. ICC) and HCC-ICC, among which hepatocellular carcinoma accounts for about&#xD;
      75% of all primary liver cancer, bringing a heavy disease burden to China's health system and&#xD;
      society. At present, for patients with unresectable advanced liver cancer, the commonly used&#xD;
      treatment options include transcatheter chemoembolization (TACE), systemic therapy and&#xD;
      radiotherapy. Since the introduction of the molecular-targeted drug Sorafenib in 2007, a&#xD;
      number of clinical studies have shown that sorafenib has benefits for patients with advanced&#xD;
      liver cancer in different countries and regions and with different liver disease backgrounds.&#xD;
      It has become the standard therapy for advanced HCC and has been recommended for first-line&#xD;
      treatment of advanced HCC patients by guidelines of many countries. However, although&#xD;
      sorafenib can significantly prolong the overall survival rate, about 53-71% of patients still&#xD;
      show stable disease (SD) after treatment. For these patients, further exploration is needed&#xD;
      to optimize the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oncolytic viruses are a class of viruses that can selectively replicate in tumor cells and&#xD;
      then lytic tumor cells. Among them, recombinant human adenovirus TYPE 5 H101 is the world's&#xD;
      first commercially available oncolytic drug, which has been approved for the treatment of&#xD;
      head and neck tumors in 2003. Recombinant human adenovirus type 5 (H101) is a kind of&#xD;
      oncolytic adenovirus, which can selectively replicate in tumor cells with deficient tumor&#xD;
      suppressor gene p53 by knocking out e1B-55KD gene and partial gene fragment (78.3 ~ 85.8Î¼m)&#xD;
      of E3 region of human adenovirus type 5. Based on the data from the head and neck&#xD;
      tumor-related clinical trial of recombinant human adenovirus H101, the drug has been approved&#xD;
      for the treatment of advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma in China. Based the study found that&#xD;
      in recent years, in addition to the head and neck cancer, human recombinant adenovirus type 5&#xD;
      H101 also displayed antitumor effect on liver cancer, and the selective killing effect of the&#xD;
      low concentration H101 on liver cancer cell associated with p53 gene mutation, and the high&#xD;
      concentration of H101 on liver cancer cell and immortalized the role of normal liver cells is&#xD;
      not restricted by cell p53 status. In vitro studies showed that both H101 and sorafenib alone&#xD;
      could significantly inhibit the proliferation and induce apoptosis of human hepatoma cell&#xD;
      lines HepG2 and Hep3B, and the combined effect of the two drugs was more significant than&#xD;
      that of single drug 16. The synergistic mechanism of recombinant adenovirus H101 and&#xD;
      sorafenib may be related to the influence of Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway. Sorafenib can&#xD;
      block Raf/MEK/ERK signal transduction pathway, thereby inhibiting angiogenesis, while&#xD;
      down-regulating the expression level of anti-apoptotic protein McL-1, and further inducing&#xD;
      apoptosis of tumor cells. Meanwhile, sorafenib can upregulate the expression of Coxsackie&#xD;
      adenovirus receptor (CAR) on the surface of hepatocellular carcinoma cells, increase the&#xD;
      sensitivity of tumor cells to adenovirus, and enhance the oncolytic effect of H101. In&#xD;
      addition, H101 combined with sorafenib can also effectively inhibit the expression of VEGF,&#xD;
      thereby inhibiting the proliferation of tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the human recombinant adenovirus type 5 show the joint sorafenib synergy and its&#xD;
      potential for the curative effect of hepatocellular carcinoma, this research intends to carry&#xD;
      out a prospectie, intrusive, single-arm study, further validation of human recombinant&#xD;
      adenovirus type 5 joint sorafenib therapy efficacy and safety of primary liver cancer,&#xD;
      provides evidence-based medical evidence to support for clinical medication.&#xD;
