  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We need to identify the essential factors that are linked to readmission among older medical&#xD;
      patients as approximately 20% of all medical patients above the age of 65 are readmitted&#xD;
      within 30 days after discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this cross-sectional survey study is to to identify factors and aspects that&#xD;
      contribute to unplanned hospital readmissions of older medical patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be done through a survey where readmitted patients and their relatives and&#xD;
      healthcare professionals answer questions about the patients readmission. The survey&#xD;
      questions cover following themes: 1) disease, 2) diagnostics, treatment and care, 3) social&#xD;
      network, 4) organisation, 5) communication, 6) competences and knowledge, 7) resources and 8)&#xD;
      practical aspects. The hypothesis is that the more knowledge we gain on factors that&#xD;
      contribute to readmission, the more targeted actions and interventions and thus preventing&#xD;
      readmissions.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The objective of this cross-sectional survey study to identify unique factors and aspects&#xD;
      involved in the process of unplanned hospital readmissions of medical patients aged 65 or&#xD;
      above within 30 days of discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify these factors following research questions will be examined:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. what are the most prevalent factors that contribute to 30-days readmissions among&#xD;
           medical patients above 65 years?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to what degree do patients, relative and health care professionals agree upon the&#xD;
           contributing factors?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. where on the patient pathway between sectors are the contributing factors most&#xD;
           prevalent?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unplanned Readmission is defined as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The admission occurs between four hours and 30 days after the last admission&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The onset of the admission is acute&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The admission cannot be a result of a referral from another hospital or ward&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient cannot have a cancer- or accident diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Admission not part of existing treatment regimen, such as intravenous antibiotic&#xD;
           treatment, or readmission planned at latest discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respondents are divided in five groups: patients and their relative, community-based nurses,&#xD;
      general practitioners (GP) and hospital-based doctors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA COLLECTION Patients will be prospectively recruited September 2020 to June 2021. All&#xD;
      eligible patients will be asked to sign an informed consent for use of individual healthcare&#xD;
      data. No formal ethical approval is necessary. Data collection will be performed by the PhD&#xD;
      student and project staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected from two sources; 1) from questionnaires and from 2) CROSS-TRACKS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from questionnaires There is no existing questionnaire that examine factors that&#xD;
      contribute to readmissions among medical patients aged 65 or above. Therefore, to evaluate&#xD;
      unique dimensions on the same readmission, study-specific questionnaires have been developed&#xD;
      to examine the perspectives on the readmission from the patient, relative, community-based&#xD;
      nurse (if the patient has home health care), GP, and receiving hospital-based doctor. The&#xD;
      development process will be described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Development of the questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In short, the stepwise process of developing the study-specific questionnaires is described&#xD;
      below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 1: to prepare and conduct semi-structured interviews to generate knowledge from the&#xD;
      target groups. In total, 25 interviews of one hour were conducted with patients, relatives,&#xD;
      GPs, community-based nurses and hospital doctors. These interviews were transcribed and the&#xD;
      content was condensed and coded using NVIVO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 2: to gain knowledge from peer reviewed evidence on risk factors and predictors of&#xD;
      readmission among older medical patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 3: the 3 questionnaires were developed. Knowledge gathered from the two preliminary&#xD;
      steps were used to create the individual items in the questionnaire. A formative&#xD;
      questionnaire model was chosen. Likert scales, open-ended questions, multiple choice and&#xD;
      yes/no/don't know were chosen as response formats, developed, and subsequently validated by&#xD;
      an expert in questionnaires. The questionnaires were pilot tested twice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 4: the 3 questionnaires were finalized, implemented and pilot tested in a study-specific&#xD;
      REDCap database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaires to GPs, hospital doctors and community-based nurses are identical. The 3&#xD;
      questionnaires cover following factors that can contribute to unplanned hospital&#xD;
      readmissions: 1) disease specific factors, 2) diagnostic specific factors, treatment and care&#xD;
      specific factors, 3) social network specific factors, 4) organisation specific factors, 5)&#xD;
      communication specific factors, 6) competences and knowledge specific factors, 7) resources&#xD;
      specific factors and 8) practical specific factors. The questionnaire to the patients is a&#xD;
      short version modified to frail and vulnerable older people. The questionnaire to the&#xD;
      relatives is an intermediate version between the questionnaire to the health care&#xD;
      professionals and patients. All responders receive a personal link which ensures that the&#xD;
      survey only can be answered by this specific person.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unplanned readmitted patients will be approached and enrolled in the study within 72 hours&#xD;
      after readmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who accept to participate in the study, accept data collection through registers,&#xD;
      questionnaire and accept data collection from their relatives, GP, community-based nurse and&#xD;
      hospital-based doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from CORSS-TRACKS Data will be retrieved from CORSS-TRACKS. CORSS-TRACKS data are&#xD;
      gathered from different Danish sources and cover; 1) Primary care; Municipality-based&#xD;
      electronic care provision record, Danish National Health Service Register, Danish National&#xD;
      Database of Reimbursed Prescriptions, Prehospital electronic record, 2) Secondary care;&#xD;
      Danish National Patient Registry, Electronic health record, Clinical laboratory information&#xD;
      system, 3) Danish Civil Registration System and 4) Danish Register for Evaluation of&#xD;
      Marginalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORSS-TRACKS data is merged with data collected from questionnaires to conduct sub-analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANALYSIS Quantitative analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Descriptive analysis including prevalence&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohen's kappa or similar analysis for the level of agreement between responses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ Quantitative content analysis will be used as method to analyze open-ended questions. NVivo&#xD;
      will be used when coding the content.&#xD;
