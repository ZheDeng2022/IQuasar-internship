  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gates MRI-RSM01-101 is a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, occurrence&#xD;
      of ADA, and assessment of neutralizing antibody against RSV after administration of single&#xD;
      intravenous or intramuscular doses of RSM01 to healthy adults.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of lower respiratory tract&#xD;
      infection (LRTI) among infants and young children, resulting in annual epidemics worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RSM01, a monoclonal antibody targeting RSV, may potentially provide an effective method to&#xD;
      protect infants from RSV disease based on its potency and an extended half-life that is&#xD;
      expected to support once-per-RSV-season administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a first-in-human evaluation of RSM01 in healthy male and female adults with the&#xD;
      goal of characterizing the safety and tolerability of a range of single doses of RSM01 to&#xD;
      enable determination of appropriate dose(s) to be administered to infants in a future study.&#xD;
      Enrollment is planned at a single study center in the United States. Approximately 56&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled; 48 participants to receive RSM01 and 8 participants to&#xD;
      received placebo. Participants will be followed for approximately 5 months (151 days) after&#xD;
      dosing.&#xD;
