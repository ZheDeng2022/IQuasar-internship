    <textblock>
      The goal of this longitudinal and observational study is to better understand the psychiatric&#xD;
      consequences of COVID-19 over time. Psychiatric outcomes like mood, anxiety, stress, and&#xD;
      cognitive symptoms in patients who underwent inpatient hospitalization at&#xD;
      NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medicine for COVID-19 will be assessed at 12-36&#xD;
      months post-discharge.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive functioning as measured by Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) (English or Spanish)</measure>
    <time_frame>Once, 12-36 months post discharge from the hospital</time_frame>
    <description>The Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) comprises auditory and visual subtasks of attention, language, visuospatial/constructional abilities, and immediate and delayed memory. Each subtask is assessed as accuracy (number of correct responses) and subsequently combined into a composite score (RBANS Total Scale score).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Executive functioning as measured by the Oral Trail Making Test-B (OTMT-B; English or Spanish)</measure>
    <time_frame>Once, 12-36 months post discharge from the hospital</time_frame>
    <description>The oral version of the Trail Making Test (OTMT) assesses processing speed, working memory, and attention. Participants have to say out loud numbers and letters in alternating sequence and the time to completion is recorded.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive control as measured by the Stroop test (English or Spanish)</measure>
    <time_frame>Once, 12-36 months post discharge from the hospital</time_frame>
    <description>The Stroop Color and Word Test (SCWT) is used to assess verbal processing speed and ability to inhibit cognitive interference. Participants have to read out loud words, colors, and color words printed in different colored ink. The number of correct responses in 45 seconds is recorded.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Verbal intellectual ability as measured by the National Adult Reading Test (NART) for English speakers and the Word Accentuation Test (WAT), a Spanish-language analog of the NART for Spanish speakers.</measure>
    <time_frame>Once, 12-36 months post discharge from the hospital</time_frame>
    <description>Participants have to read a set of words out loud and the number correct is recorded. Number of errors are recorded out of 61 words.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Verbal Fluency (English or Spanish)</measure>
    <time_frame>Once, 12-36 months post discharge from the hospital</time_frame>
    <description>This test requires participants to verbally produce words that start with given letters in a given time. The number of total valid words is used to indicate of successful selective information retrieval from memory.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mood symptoms as assessed by DASS (English or Spanish)</measure>
    <time_frame>Once, 12-36 months post discharge from the hospital</time_frame>
    <description>Participants' moods will be assessed by Depression and Anxiety Scale (DASS) which is 42 item quantitative measure of three related negative emotional states of depression, anxiety and stress. The scores are interpreted for all three areas and higher scores indicate that the participant experiences increased emotional distress in either or all areas. For depression, the score ranges of 0-9 mean normal, 10-13 is mild, 14-20 moderate, 21-27 severe, and 28+ would be categorized under extremely severe depression. For anxiety, 0-7 is normal, 8-9 mild, 10-14 moderate, 15-19 severe, 20+ extremely severe. And for Stress, 0-14 is normal, 15-18 mild, 19-25 moderate, 26-33 severe, and 34+ extremely severe.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mood symptoms as assessed by PANAS (English or Spanish)</measure>
    <time_frame>Once, 12-36 months post discharge from the hospital</time_frame>
    <description>The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) is a 20-item scale to measure affect. The scale consists of different words that alternate between positive and negative affect and each item is rated on a 5 point scale. Scores can range from 10-50 for both the Positive and Negative Affect with the lower scores representing lower levels of Positive/Negative Affect and higher scores representing higher levels of Positive/Negative Affect.</description>

    <measure>Resilience as assessed by Brief Resilience Scale (English or Spanish)</measure>
    <time_frame>Once, 12-36 months post discharge from the hospital</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief Resilience Scale (BRS) is 6-item questionnaire used to assess the participant's perceived ability to recover from stressful events. The possible score range on each item is from 1 (low resilience) to 5 (high resilience).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive difficulties in daily life as assessed by Neuro Quality of Life (NeuroQOL) (English or Spanish)</measure>
