  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, single-arm, interventional phase I/II trial to evaluate the safety&#xD;
      profile and potential efficacy of allogeneic CAR19 regulatory T cells (CAR19-tTreg) in adults&#xD;
      with relapsed/refractory (R/R) CD19+ B Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (B-ALL). The study consists&#xD;
      of two components. The dose finding component is a modified version of a Phase I trial and&#xD;
      the extended component is a modified Phase II trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I Dose Finding Component:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phase I component incorporates the continual reassessment method (CRM) to determine the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CAR19-tTreg. Up to 5 doses levels will be tested. The goal of&#xD;
      the CRM is to identify the dose level which most closely corresponds to the targeted dose&#xD;
      limiting toxicity (DLT) rate of 25%. Patients are enrolled in cohorts beginning at the&#xD;
      Initial Dose Level (1.0 x 10 6 CAR19-tTreg/kg). A minimum of 28 days (end of the DLT&#xD;
      evaluation period) will separate each cohort prior to enrollment in the next cohort. In&#xD;
      cohort 1, a minimum of 28 days separates each patient. In subsequent cohorts, a minimum of 28&#xD;
      days separates the 1 st and 2 nd patient and 14 days separates the 2 nd and 3 rd patient. As&#xD;
      enrollment proceeds, each cohort is assigned to an increased, decreased or equivalent dose&#xD;
      level based on prior data in the trial until the study sample reaches 21 or 9 patients are&#xD;
      sequentially enrolled at the same dose. At this time, the last dose is declared the MTD and&#xD;
      becomes the CAR19-tTreg dose for the extended component.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II Extended Component:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of the extended component is to study the potential efficacy of CAR19-tTreg&#xD;
      in this patient population. Efficacy is measured using rates of complete and partial&#xD;
      remission. A maximum of 10 patients will be enrolled at the MTD (including patients enrolled&#xD;
      at the MTD in the phase I component). Patients will not be staggered.&#xD;
