  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a cluster randomized controlled trial in maternity facilities&#xD;
      in Kenya to evaluate the impact of a maternal and neonatal health package intervention on&#xD;
      patient and provider outcomes. This package intervention includes two programs: PROMPTS, a&#xD;
      digital health platform for mothers aimed to improve knowledge and health behaviors and&#xD;
      increase care-seeking behavior at the right time and place, and MENTORS, a facility-based&#xD;
      program aimed to increase and sustain providers' knowledge and skills in basic and emergency&#xD;
      obstetric and newborn care. Facilities will be randomized into a treatment group that&#xD;
      receives the package or a control group that receives usual care. Patient outcomes include&#xD;
      health knowledge, health behaviors and health care utilization in the prenatal and postnatal&#xD;
      period; provider outcomes include knowledge and quality of care.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed as a parallel arm cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT).&#xD;
      Randomization of the intervention package will occur at the facility level. The investigators&#xD;
      will randomize 40 facilities across 8 counties into either the intervention or control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected at multiple points during the study period. Facility baseline data&#xD;
      collection will occur over a one month period in each facility. Baseline data collection will&#xD;
      include a facility assessment, maternity register data extraction and health worker&#xD;
      interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to evaluate the PROMPTS component of the intervention, the investigators will enroll&#xD;
      a cohort of women during baseline facility data collection that will be followed through&#xD;
      their pregnancy, delivery and postpartum period. The investigators will recruit pregnant&#xD;
      women attending study clinics for antenatal care during the baseline data collection period.&#xD;
      They will be surveyed by phone twice in the follow-up period: once in the last month of&#xD;
      pregnancy and again at 7- to 8-weeks postpartum. Women enrolled from the intervention&#xD;
      facilities will be offered the PROMPTS intervention immediately after the baseline survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The facility-based endline data collection will occur 4-5 months after the end of baseline&#xD;
      and will last for 1-2 months in each facility. The facility-based endline data collection&#xD;
      will include register data extraction, health worker interviews, and observations of quality&#xD;
      of care during labor and delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A process evaluation will be conducted using administrative program data collected by&#xD;
      Jacaranda Health to monitor intervention implementation within the treatment facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the endline, facilities in the control group will also be offered the intervention.&#xD;
