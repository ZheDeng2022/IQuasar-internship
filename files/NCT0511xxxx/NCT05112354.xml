    <textblock>
      Sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) is an otological emergency that is defined as a&#xD;
      hearing loss greater than 30 dB over three consecutive frequencies within 72 hours, with&#xD;
      abnormalities of the cochlea, auditory nerve, or central auditory system.1 During 2006 and&#xD;
      2007, the annual incidence of SSNHL was 5-27/100,000 persons per year in the United&#xD;
      states.2,3 The causative etiologies for SSNHL included viruses, microcirculation&#xD;
      abnormalities, and autoimmune disorders. However, definitive evidence remains elusive.4,5&#xD;
      Currently, steroids are the treatment of choice due to their effects on the inner ear such as&#xD;
      immunosuppression and circular enhancement.6,7 Combined systemic and intra-tympanic steroid&#xD;
      treatment has previously been reported to be beneficial for SSNHL patients, with overall&#xD;
      better treatment outcomes.8,9 However, due to the heterogeneous pathological nature and&#xD;
      spontaneous recovery potential of the disease, few controlled studies exist in the&#xD;
      literature. As a result, the treatment strategies of SSNHL remain a controversial issue in&#xD;
      clinicalpractice .10 The condition exhibits a wide age distribution , with an average of&#xD;
      50-60 years and no sex preference. The hearing loss is unilateral in most Population studies&#xD;
      of sudden sensorineural hearing loss cases, with bilateral involvement reported in less than&#xD;
      5%. 11 The severity of the hearing loss is divided roughly equally into mild, moderate, and&#xD;
      severe profound. The configuration of the hearing loss varies and can affect high, low, or&#xD;
      all frequencies. Tinnitus occurs in about 80% of patients, and vertigo, indicating an&#xD;
      associated peripheral vestibular dysfunction, in about 30%. 12 The response to medical&#xD;
      therapy shows inconsistent results regarding symptoms especially hearing loss may be due to&#xD;
      the uncertainty about the cause of the disease and its progress. little is known about the&#xD;
      factors which may contribute to either success or failure of the medical therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of work&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the factors contributing to the success or failure of standardized medical&#xD;
           therapy in cases of ISSNHL&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To detect the degree of correlation of the presenting symptoms and comorbidities to the&#xD;
           patient final hearing prognosis.&#xD;

      Patient and methods Study design The study will be conducted as across sectional observation&#xD;
      study. Study setting ENT Department Assiut University Hospital outpatient clinic in the&#xD;
      period between the 1st July 2019 end of June 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria All cases above 6 years presented with unilateral or bilateral ISSNHL&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria Patient below 6 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      After fulfilling all inclusion and exclusion criteria all the patient will be subjected to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Full History taking including : the residency, occupation, duration of the clinical&#xD;
           symptoms , associated symptoms like tinnitus , vertigo and aural fullness, the presence&#xD;
           of previous episodes of hearing loss, the presence of any chronic medical condition&#xD;
           especially diabetes and hypertension and neurological history, the medication history&#xD;
           and surgical history specially ear surgeries, in addition to family history if relevant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Full medical examination including general examination with special emphasizing upon&#xD;
           blood pressure measurements, full neurological examination, full ENT examination with&#xD;
           vestibular testing especially in cases presented with vertigo&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laboratory investigation Complete blood count test with differential to detect&#xD;
           neutrophil lymphocyte monocyte ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Renal function test Liver function test. Random blood sugar, oral glucose testing, HbA1c&#xD;
&#xD;
      audiological evaluation upon recruitment, all the patient will be subjected to audiological&#xD;
      evaluation using audiogram where the hearing loss will be graded into mild, moderate, , sever&#xD;
      and profound. speech discrimition will be graded into good ,fair and poor upon recruitment,&#xD;
      all the patient will be subjected to audiological evaluation using ABR to asses retrocochlear&#xD;
      pathology&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management plan&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. If the patient come at first two weeks of onset of hearing loss the patient will be&#xD;
           manged by oral corticosteroid in the form of ,prednisolone60mg in two divided doses for&#xD;
           2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patient will be manged by 5 sessions of intratympanic steroid after failure of systemic&#xD;
           steroid and patient who come after 2 weeks of onset of hearing loss , each session will&#xD;
           be 3 days apart. The injectable material will be 1ml of hydrocortisone 8ml. The&#xD;
           injection will be done under local anesthesia and microscope magnification. A pack of&#xD;
           lidocaine gel will be applied in the external canal for 10 minutes in EAC to induce&#xD;
           anesthesia by using insulin syringe 1ml bore.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An 8 ml of hydrocortisone will be injected in the ME through posteroinferior part of TM All&#xD;
      patients will receive antiviral therapy in the form of acyclovir,valcyclovir All the patient&#xD;
      will receive vasodilator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up All the patient will be subjected to audiological evaluation using the audiogram 2&#xD;
      weeks and one month after the initiation of the therapy to detect the treatment outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Factors affecting the treatment outcome will be grouped into&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Age.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Onset of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. . tinnitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. vertigo.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. audiogram to detect the degree of hearing loss mild,moderate severe profund .speech&#xD;
                discrimition low frequencies versus high frequencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Complete blood count test with differential to detect neutrophil lymphocyte&#xD;
                monocyte ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. Comorbidities as hypertension cardiac All those factors will be compared to each&#xD;
                other and to the final hearing outcome using correlation coefficient, regression&#xD;
                analysis using the SPSS 20 software.&#xD;
