  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metabolic acidosis is a common problem that occurs with worsening chronic kidney disease.&#xD;
      Dietary acid can build up when the kidneys are not working well. This can be associated with&#xD;
      a higher risk of worsening kidney function and death. The usual treatment is a medication&#xD;
      called sodium bicarbonate which works to balance the acids in the body. The medication&#xD;
      however often does not work and causes side effects. Consumption of alkalizing fruits and&#xD;
      vegetables may work as a treatment for metabolic acidosis. This trial is being done to see if&#xD;
      fruits and vegetables, provided via home delivery, can become a viable treatment for&#xD;
      metabolic acidosis in patients with chronic kidney disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Metabolic acidosis is a common complication of advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). As&#xD;
      kidney function declines, the ability to excrete excess dietary acid is reduced. This can&#xD;
      lead to the development of metabolic acidosis, an imbalance in the body's acid-base balance.&#xD;
      Metabolic acidosis is associated with a higher risk of CKD progression and mortality. Typical&#xD;
      treatment includes an oral alkali, such as sodium citrate or sodium bicarbonate. Recent&#xD;
      studies have shown that the treatment of metabolic acidosis can reduce the decline in kidney&#xD;
      function and potentially prevent progression of CKD to dialysis. Treatment rates with an oral&#xD;
      alkali are low because the treatments are ineffective, often poorly tolerated, and may be&#xD;
      associated with net harm. Base producing fruit and vegetables are a potential treatment of&#xD;
      metabolic acidosis by reducing the dietary contribution to overall acid load that must be&#xD;
      managed by the kidneys. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials using&#xD;
      oral alkali supplements or reduction in dietary acid intake using fruits and vegetables, when&#xD;
      compared to no treatment, usual care or placebo found that these treatments increased serum&#xD;
      bicarbonate and slowed the decline of kidney function. Fruits and vegetables are an effective&#xD;
      and well-tolerated therapy for the treatment of metabolic acidosis in CKD. While oral alkali&#xD;
      therapy has known adverse effects, important limitations also exist in the widespread&#xD;
      applicability of fruits and vegetables as a treatment for metabolic acidosis. Only 2 single&#xD;
      center randomized trials have examined the efficacy of fruits and vegetables as a treatment&#xD;
      for acidosis. This dual-center pilot trial will be the first randomized trial in Canada to&#xD;
      evaluate the feasibility of providing fruits and vegetables via home delivery to patients as&#xD;
      a treatment for CKD and metabolic acidosis. This study will be critical in designing a&#xD;
      pan-Canadian phase 3 trial testing the efficacy of alkalizing fruits and vegetable provision&#xD;
      on slowing the progression of CKD.&#xD;

    <description>Participants randomized to fruit and vegetables (F+V) will receive weekly supplementation of alkalizing fruits and vegetables via home delivery in a box format. Participants will receive a 1-hour dietary counseling session in the first week from a registered dietitian (RD), either in person or via videoconference, depending on regional coronavirus disease (COVID) 19 restrictions and participant preference, which will outline the concepts of the dietary intervention. The RD will also recommend the best ways to prepare and include the F+V into the participant's current diet. Intervention will last 12 months.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to the alkali therapy will receive oral sodium bicarbonate 500mg tablets three times a day, reflecting a common starting dose at clinical practice. Thereafter, decisions around dose titration for the sodium bicarbonate will then be transferred to the participant's nephrologist who will be responsible for monitoring the participants serum bicarbonate concentration with a goal of maintaining a serum bicarbonate level &gt;22 mEq/L. Participants will receive counselling from a registered dietician (RD) as part of the standard care. Intervention will last 12 months.</description>

    <description>The weekly deliveries will contain combinations of fresh, frozen, and dried fruits and vegetables, as well as juices and soups which have been selected for their negative potential renal acid load (PRAL) values and shelf-life. All participants will be started at a F+V intake equal to -30 to -40 mEq per day reduction in dietary acid load estimated by the PRAL equation. Participants serum bicarbonate concentration will be measured at 1 month, and at 3 months, those with values &lt; 22 mEq/L will have their recommended amount of F+V increased to -40 to -50 mEq per day. If a participant's 1- or 3-month serum bicarbonate value exceeds 29 mEq/L, their target dose of F+V in mEq/d will be reduced by 25%.</description>
