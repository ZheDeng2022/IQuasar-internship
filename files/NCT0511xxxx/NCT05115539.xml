  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fluid are used to increase cardiac output (CO) and blood pressure in patients admitted to the&#xD;
      intensive care unit (ICU) .Fluid is an important line of therapy that needed in shocked&#xD;
      patient, hypovolemic and following surgery to correct the volume state and avoid acute kidney&#xD;
      injury. However, excess fluid administration may be harmful leading itself to increase rates&#xD;
      of acute kidney injury (AKI), prolonged days of mechanical ventilation and death . Excess&#xD;
      fluid administration may increase right and left atrial pressure leading to congestion and&#xD;
      edema.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Increasing cardiac output more than 15% following fluid administration was used as fluid&#xD;
      responsiveness method by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) guidelines. However, these&#xD;
      strategies may promote over-resuscitation as most recommend continuing fluid administration&#xD;
      until the patients are no longer VR. VR-based strategies do not assess elevations in right&#xD;
      atrial pressure (RAP) or assess for venous congestion which could occur earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The elevations of left atrial pressure can be seen clinically with hypoxia, cephalization on&#xD;
      chest X-ray and B-lines on ultrasound resulting from pulmonary edema, while the elevation in&#xD;
      right-sided pressure is much more difficult to detect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is possible that rightsided venous flow changes detect clinically important elevations in&#xD;
      right atrial pressure that lead to venous congestion and end organ injury . Doppler flow&#xD;
      patterns of hepatic veins (HV), portal vein (PV) and intra-renal veins (RV) are noninvasive&#xD;
      and accurately identify early stages of right-sided venous congestion in patients who have&#xD;
      cardiac dysfunction and congestive heart failure with elevated right atrial pressures . If&#xD;
      HV, PV and RV can be validated as reliable measures of elevated RAP, such indicators might&#xD;
      have utility in modulating fluid resuscitation in other critically ill patient populations.&#xD;

    <description>Hepatic Vein Doppler : To obtain the HV PW, a phased array transducer is used with cardiac pre-sets. ECG leads are placed to assist in the interpretation of HVD in sinus rhythm as well as atrial fibrillation. The middle hepatic vein is identified from mid-subcostal or lateral views during the end-expiratory phase of the patients respiratory cycle.&#xD;
Portal vein Doppler: From a lateral costal or subcostal window, the portal vein is identified in the coronal plane using a phased-array transducer. The PV were considered abnormal if the pulsatilty index was greater than 30%. The portal pulsatility index was defined as: (VMax - VMin/VMax) * 100%. Here, VMax is the maximal velocity and VMin is the minimal velocity during the cardiac cycle.&#xD;
Intra-renal venous Doppler: From lateral costal window, the kidney is located in the coronal plane and a color flow box placed over the distal renal calyceal junction to cortex.</description>
