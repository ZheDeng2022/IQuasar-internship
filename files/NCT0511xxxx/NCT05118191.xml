  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this research study is to assess how the implementation of various&#xD;
      commercially available devices affect sleep quality, sleep structure, nocturnal physiology,&#xD;
      subjective wellness, recovery from stressors, and resultant effects on performance and&#xD;
      well-being.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sleep is a vital process for memory, cognitive performance, physical recovery, hormonal&#xD;
      balance, and the repair of cellular damage, among numerous other functions. Despite its&#xD;
      importance for maintaining one's health, it is amongst the most variable human behaviors&#xD;
      experienced across the population. While many individuals fail to allocate sufficient time in&#xD;
      their schedules for sufficient sleep, many individuals allocate plenty of time but struggle&#xD;
      to receive efficient, and good quality sleep. In both cases, failure of the body to receive&#xD;
      its required combination of enough and efficient enough sleep can result in significant&#xD;
      consequences, including increased rates of disease development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an effort to help with these issues, which affect a significant portion of the adult&#xD;
      population, commercial companies have sought to combine science, convenience, and good&#xD;
      hygienic practices in the development of products aimed toward augmenting sleep. A wide range&#xD;
      of products have hit the market including supplements (i.e. melatonin, melatonin infused&#xD;
      products, GABA), sound producing devices (i.e. white noise machines), wearable products (i.e.&#xD;
      sleep masks, special pajamas), and physiological modification devices and routines (i.e.&#xD;
      temperature modulators, meditation), among dozens of other products, all with varying degrees&#xD;
      of validity and scientific backing. Thermoregulatory products, the types of technologies&#xD;
      utilized herein, have a great deal of scientific backing in how they have the potential to&#xD;
      enhance sleep behaviors. Given the critical reduction in core body temperature that is needed&#xD;
      at sleep onset, careful modulation of reduced body temperature is vital for falling asleep,&#xD;
      staying asleep, and receiving good quality sleep. While these products demonstrate promising&#xD;
      potential, further research is needed to identify the efficacy of these products in enhancing&#xD;
      sleep. Further, it is of high interest what aspects of sleep can be enhanced via&#xD;
      thermoregulation, what factors contribute to the degree of intervention impact, and what&#xD;
      subsequent facets of overall well-being and performance are most improved by this type of&#xD;
      sleep modulation.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will undergo 4 weeks of baseline data collection followed by 4 weeks of data collection while utilizing an assigned sleep augmentation device each night during sleep. Augmentation devices will be assigned with respect to 1) eligibility of inclusion/exclusion criteria of each device and 2) interest in participating with the available devices based upon responses in the qualifying survey on sleep preferences. If participants indicated that they were willing to try both the OOLER &amp; the Embr Wave, &amp; were eligible to do so, they will be randomly assigned a device based upon current availability. Women who experience menstrual flow will be scheduled to ensure that flow occurs on weeks 4 &amp; 8 for consistency.&#xD;
Participants will complete daily, weekly, &amp; monthly surveys, as well as weekly &amp; monthly cognitive assessments. Participants will also have their sleep monitored nightly via the OURA ring &amp; EEG headband. An additional exit survey will be completed at the end of week 8.</intervention_model_description>
