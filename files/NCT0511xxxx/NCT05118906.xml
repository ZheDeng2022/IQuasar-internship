    <description>Quality of life as per assessment on the Clinical Global Improvement (CGI-I) scale measured at randomization and at the end of the treatment period. The CGI is a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to assessment of the patient's illness at the beginning of the intervention (Baseline state) and rated as: 1, Normal, not at all ill; 2, Borderline mentally ill; 3, Mildly ill; 4, Moderately ill; 5, Markedly ill; 6, Severely ill; 7, Among the most extremely ill patients.&#xD;
The Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale (CGI-I) is a 7 point scale that requires the clinician to assess how much the patient's illness has improved or worsened relative to a baseline state at the beginning of the intervention and rated as: 1, very much improved; 2, much improved; 3, minimally improved; 4, no change; 5, minimally worse; 6, much worse; or 7, very much worse.</description>
