    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop comprehensive and efficient pre- and post-&#xD;
      musculoskeletal injury (MSKI) risk assessments for Service members, incorporating both&#xD;
      objective and subjective measures. This is a multi-site observational study to identify the&#xD;
      pre- and post-MSKI physical and psychosocial factors contributing to MSKI risks and undesired&#xD;
      patient outcomes following MSKI. The study hypothesis is that a set of field-expedient&#xD;
      clinical assessments can identify Service member specific MSKI risk factors and post-MSKI&#xD;
      deficits that contribute to undesired patient outcomes and provide data to guide&#xD;
      patient-specific risk mitigation and rehabilitation programs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-combat related musculoskeletal injuries (MSKI) are the leading cause of morbidity and&#xD;
      disability in the United States Military, eroding combat readiness more than any other single&#xD;
      disease or health condition. The MSKI problem is challenging to address, in part because it&#xD;
      is difficult to systematically and comprehensively assess all of the factors that increase&#xD;
      MSKI risk and those factors that influence post-MSKI outcomes, value-based care must have the&#xD;
      necessary infrastructure to capture and process actionable information, and then implement&#xD;
      relevant changes (i.e., learning healthcare system). However, there are no comprehensive&#xD;
      Military Health System (MHS) recommendations regarding the collection and use of objective&#xD;
      and subjective patient-centric data to inform MSKI risk assessment and mitigation strategies.&#xD;
      PREPARE will develop efficient pre- and post-MSKI risk assessments that incorporate objective&#xD;
      and subjective measures. The overall study objective is to develop comprehensive clinical&#xD;
      assessments that identify the Service member specific factors that contribute to MSKI risks&#xD;
      and undesired post-MSKI outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These objectives will be achieved by the following Specific Aims (SA):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #1: Determine the intra-rater, inter-rater, and inter-day reliability of the&#xD;
      study related measurements within a (pilot) cohort of healthy active duty Service members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis SA#1: There will be good-to-excellent intra-rater, inter-rater, and inter-day&#xD;
      reliability for study related measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #2: Determine the pre-MSKI physical and psychosocial traits of Service members&#xD;
      that differentiate between individuals who go on to sustain an MSKI and those who do not&#xD;
      within 1 year of study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis SA#2: A common set of field- expedient physical (e.g., movement assessments, gait,&#xD;
      joint range of motion) and psychosocial (e.g., National Institutes of Health Patient-Reported&#xD;
      Outcomes Measurement Information System [PROMIS], TSK-11) assessments can identify the&#xD;
      pre-MSKI factors that contribute to greater MSKI risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #3: Determine the post-MSKI physical and psychosocial traits of Service members&#xD;
      with conservatively (i.e., non-surgically) managed MSKIs that differentiate between&#xD;
      individuals who go on to have undesired outcomes and those who have expected outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis SA#3: A common set of field- expedient physical (e.g., movement assessments, gait,&#xD;
      joint range of motion) and psychosocial (e.g., NIH PROMIS, TSK-11) assessments can identify&#xD;
      the post-MSKI factors that contribute to undesired patient outcomes (e.g., increased MSKI&#xD;
      risk, symptom/condition chronification, delayed return-to-duty/activity [RTD/A]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #4: Create optimized pre- and post-MSKI clinical assessments for the&#xD;
      identification of physical and psychosocial factors that provide the information needed to&#xD;
      improve pre- and post-MSKI risk mitigation and rehabilitation strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis SA#4: A common set of semi-automated field-expedient assessments can be structured&#xD;
      to correctly inform clinical decision-making and inform Service members and healthcare&#xD;
      providers about likely patient outcomes (e.g., MSKI risk, time to RTD/A).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multi-site observational study to identify the pre- and post-MSKI physical and&#xD;
      psychosocial factors contributing to greater MSKI risk (Specific Aim #2) and undesired&#xD;
      post-MSKI outcomes (Specific Aim #3) and to identify the minimum set of clinical assessments&#xD;
      needed to provide healthcare providers with the data required to optimize MSKI care (Specific&#xD;
      Aim #4). For Specific Aim #1, 10 healthy active duty Service members will serve as a pilot&#xD;
      cohort for participation in the study. These individuals will complete all study related&#xD;
      activities so that the study team can establish the best time estimate possible for the&#xD;
      completion of study related activities. Additionally, these individuals will repeat the same&#xD;
      study related activities 7-10 days following the initial visit; this will allow the study&#xD;
      team to establish the intra-rater, inter-rater, and inter-day reliability of the study&#xD;
      related measures. For Specific Aim #2, Service members (n=560) who are onboarding to a new&#xD;
      military unit will be prospectively enrolled. Participants will undergo a comprehensive&#xD;
      pre-MSKI clinical assessment at the time of study enrollment, including clinical movement and&#xD;
      range of motion assessments, and patient reported outcome (PRO) measures. MSKI data will be&#xD;
      electronically collected monthly for up to 1-year following initial assessment. For Specific&#xD;
      Aim #3, Service members (n=780) who are receiving conservative treatment for a&#xD;
      musculoskeletal injury of the low back or lower extremity will be prospectively enrolled.&#xD;
      Service members will receive treatment for MSKIs at the discretion of the Service members'&#xD;
      healthcare providers. Participants will undergo repeat (â‰¤3 days of starting physical therapy&#xD;
      [&quot;initial&quot;]; 4 weeks post-initial assessment, or at RTD/A clearance, if prior to 4 weeks; and&#xD;
      12 weeks post-initial assessment, or at RTD/A clearance, if prior to 12 weeks) clinical&#xD;
      movement and range of motion assessments. PRO and MSKI data will be electronically collected&#xD;
      monthly for up to 1-year following the initial assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Specific Aims #2 and #3, participants will complete: 1) Clinical movement assessments&#xD;
      utilizing semi-automated kinematic (markerless motion capture system) and kinetic&#xD;
      (instrumented walkway) measurements for jump-landing, triple hop, single leg squat, double&#xD;
      leg squat, and gait assessments; 2) Range of motion measurements including hip extension, hip&#xD;
      abduction, knee flexion, knee extension, and dorsiflexion; 3) PRO measures including NIH&#xD;
      PROMIS and Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK-11),and 4) MSKI Tracking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address Specific Aim #2 and #4, the study team will use a statistical approach to select&#xD;
      and evaluate candidate assessments for the prediction of MSKIs. Optimal assessments will be&#xD;
      determined based on lowest rates of misclassification of MSKI prediction. This analysis will&#xD;
      use a machine learning algorithm (hierarchical cluster analysis) to define groups of highly&#xD;
      correlated response variables among the comprehensive set of clinical assessments. The study&#xD;
      team will describe and compare variables obtained from individual assessments by the presence&#xD;
      versus absence of MSKI through up to one year follow-up, using t-tests or a nonparametric&#xD;
      alternative. Hierarchical cluster analysis (Ward's method) will be used to next identify&#xD;
      clusters of correlated variables that minimize within-cluster variance in the dataset. Tree&#xD;
      diagrams and cluster means will be used to interpret clusters in relation to individual&#xD;
      variables and functional domains described in the literature, including performance and&#xD;
      general health measures and self- assessment of function. Sensitivity analyses will evaluate&#xD;
      the robustness of assigned groupings to the choice of clustering method, using alternative&#xD;
      algorithms to calculate similarity between clusters (e.g., complete linkage or group average&#xD;
      methods).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cluster analysis results will be used to derive reduced, candidate assessments from potential&#xD;
      combinations of the individual variables found characterized by the identified clusters. The&#xD;
      candidate assessment variables will be evaluated as predictors in binary classification&#xD;
      models (e.g., logistic or Lasso regression) of MSKI through up to one year follow-up.&#xD;
      Misclassification rates will be reported as the percent of participants where the outcome was&#xD;
      incorrectly predicted after thresholding using clinically relevant sensitivities and&#xD;
      specificities. Cross-validation will be used to minimize bias in estimated probabilities. The&#xD;
      study team will select assessments that combine to have the lowest model-based&#xD;
      misclassification rates and shortest completion times to create the optimal MSKI risk&#xD;
      assessment (Specific Aim #4). Completion times will be estimated based on observed times to&#xD;
      administer each individual item. Analyses will be repeated restricting outcomes to the most&#xD;
      common individual MSKI types (versus no MSKI), to evaluate for qualitative differences in&#xD;
      optimal assessments by injury type.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address Specific Aims #3 and #4, the study team will use a statistical approach to select&#xD;
      and evaluate candidate assessments for the prediction of MSKI outcomes (Specific Aim #3).&#xD;
      Optimal assessments will be determined based on lowest rates of misclassification of outcomes&#xD;
      and shortest assessment times. This analysis will use a machine learning algorithm&#xD;
      (hierarchical cluster analysis) to define groups of highly correlated response variables&#xD;
      among the comprehensive set of clinical assessments. The study team will use hierarchical&#xD;
      cluster analysis (Ward's method) to identify clusters of observations that minimize&#xD;
      within-cluster variance at the baseline visit. Tree diagrams and cluster means will be used&#xD;
      to interpret clusters in relation to individual variables and functional domains described in&#xD;
      the literature, including performance and general health measures and self-assessment of&#xD;
      function. Sensitivity analyses will evaluate the robustness of assigned groupings to the&#xD;
      choice of clustering method, using alternative algorithms to calculate similarity between&#xD;
      clusters (e.g., complete linkage or group average methods). Analyses will be repeated within&#xD;
      subgroups of MSKI type to evaluate for potential qualitative differences in identified&#xD;
      clusters across injury types.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cluster analysis results will be used to derive reduced, candidate assessments from potential&#xD;
      combinations of the individual variables characterized by the identified clusters. The&#xD;
      candidate assessment variables will be evaluated as predictors in binary classification&#xD;
      models (e.g., logistic or Lasso regression) of undesired patient outcomes. Misclassification&#xD;
      rates will be reported as the percent of patients where the outcome was incorrectly predicted&#xD;
      after thresholding using clinically relevant sensitivities and specificities.&#xD;
      Cross-validation will be used to minimize bias in estimated probabilities. The study team&#xD;
      will select assessments that combine to have the lowest model-based misclassification rates&#xD;
      and shortest completion times to create the optimal post-MSKI assessment (Specific Aim #4).&#xD;
      Completion times will be estimated based on observed times to administer each individual&#xD;
      item. Analyses will be repeated for back pain versus less frequent MSKI types, and for the&#xD;
      12-week follow-up visit, to evaluate for differences in optimal assessments by MSKI type and&#xD;
      time post-MSKI. Because primary analyses will be based on baseline assessments and outcomes&#xD;
      ascertained by internet-based questionnaires to minimize attrition, no imputation of missing&#xD;
      data is planned.&#xD;
