  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The effectiveness of the pulsed field ablation system in the treatment of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is evaluated by the 12-month ablation success rate of atrial fibrillation.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months after the ablation</time_frame>
    <description>12-month ablation success rate of atrial fibrillation is defined by ECG data (including ECG and 24-hour dynamic electrocardiogram (Holter)) during the effective evaluation period (blanking period to the end of 12-month follow-up), without recording AF, AFL or AT (Arrhythmia monitoring device ≥ 30 seconds).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Acute isolation success rate</measure>
    <time_frame>20 minutes after the ablation</time_frame>
    <description>Acute isolation success refers to maintaining electrical isolation of the pulmonary vein 20 minutes after completion of all pulmonary vein ablation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ablation efficiency including total procedure time, catheter dwell time, pulse discharge time and total X-ray exposure time</measure>
    <time_frame>immediately after the ablation</time_frame>
    <description>Total procedure time (defined as the total time from initial femoral venipuncture to final catheter removal), catheter dwell time (time between the pulsed field ablation catheter entering the left atrium and its withdrawal from the left atrium), pulse discharge time (The total time of delivering pulse energy through the pulsed field ablation catheter, single ablation time ablation times), total X-ray exposure time (the total time of X-ray imaging of the catheter).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of device-related or operating-related major adverse events (MAE) 3 months after surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months after the ablation</time_frame>
    <description>Including death, myocardial infarction, stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), pulmonary vein stenosis, phrenic nerve palsy, systemic circulatory embolism, pericarditis*, cardiac tamponade/perforation, atrial esophageal fistula, and severe vascular access complications.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of severe adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months after the ablation</time_frame>
    <description>Refers to an event that occurs during the clinical trial that results in mortality or serious deterioration in patient health, including a fatal illness or injury, a permanent defect in body structure or body function, or an event that requires medical or surgical intervention to avoid one or more permanent defects in body structure or body function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of device-related adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months after the ablation</time_frame>
    <description>Device-related adverse events refer to an adverse medical event related to the use of a device that occurs during the course of the clinical trial. However, a distinction should be made with respect to normal postoperative stress response, such as fever and chest and back discomfort, which, in the judgment of the investigator, need not be recorded as an adverse event. Recording of device-related adverse events will be applicable for conditions that are deemed by the investigator to be definitely related, possibly related, or of indeterminate relationship, to the test device.</description>
