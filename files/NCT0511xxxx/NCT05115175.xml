  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study had two primary aims. First, the investigators examined the associations between&#xD;
      mindfulness and diabetes-related outcomes. It was hypothesized that at baseline, increased&#xD;
      mindfulness would be associated with decreased diabetes distress and more optimal glycemic&#xD;
      levels and that all three variables would share similar associations with related constructs&#xD;
      including greater self-compassion, lower general stress, better psychosocial health,&#xD;
      increased diabetes treatment engagement, and greater diabetes-related quality of life. The&#xD;
      association between specific aspects of dispositional mindfulness and diabetes distress was&#xD;
      also explored. Second, the investigators examined the acceptability, feasibility, and&#xD;
      potential utility of self-led MBSR intervention. It was hypothesized that participation in a&#xD;
      self-led MBSR intervention would be feasible and acceptable, evidenced by treatment attrition&#xD;
      and participant feedback. It was also hypothesized that participants who received the&#xD;
      self-led Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) intervention would experience increased&#xD;
      mindfulness and decreased diabetes distress compared to a waitlist control group.&#xD;

      The goal of the present study was to assess the associations of dispositional mindfulness,&#xD;
      diabetes distress, and glycemic outcomes for adolescents with type 1 diabetes as well as to&#xD;
      use an iterative approach to developing a self-led scalable mindfulness-based intervention. A&#xD;
      self-led mindfulness-based intervention may provide a mindfulness practice to help&#xD;
      adolescents with type 1 diabetes improve glycemic outcomes through diabetes distress&#xD;
      reduction while also being practical within a pediatric endocrinology clinic. A self-led&#xD;
      intervention may also reduce the burden associated with mindfulness-based interventions. This&#xD;
      is important considering the heightened emotional and time burden adolescents may already&#xD;
      experience due to disease management and the intensity of a traditional mindfulness-based&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Adolescents (N=25) aged 14 to 18 diagnosed with type 1 diabetes completed a baseline assessment. Participants were randomized to receive a 10-week self-guided mindfulness-based stress reduction program immediately (n=10) or after a 10-week wait (n=15). During the intervention period, participants completed weekly assignments and qualitative and quantitative feedback surveys. At 10-weeks and 20-weeks follow-up assessments were completed.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Mindfulness as Assessed by Mindful Attention Awareness Scale-Adolescent (MAAS-A)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks intervention, 20 weeks waitlist</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed difference in dispositional mindfulness in adolescents from pre-intervention to post-intervention. The Mindful Attention Awareness Scale-Adolescent has a single-factor structure with 14 items rated on a 6-point scale (1 = almost always, 6 = almost never). Higher scores indicate higher trait mindfulness.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Engagement in Self-Compassionate Behavior as Assessed by Self-Compassion Scale (SCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks intervention, 20 weeks waitlist</time_frame>
    <description>Participants rated how often they engage in each self-compassionate behavior in specific situations pre- and post-intervention. The Self-Compassion Scale is a 26-item measure rated on a 5-point scale (1 = almost never, 5 = almost always). Higher scores indicate higher self-compassion.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Diabetes Stress as Assessed by Diabetes Stress Questionnaire (DSQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks intervention, 20 weeks waitlist</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed different daily, diabetes-specific stressors from pre-intervention to post-intervention. The Diabetes Stress Questionnaire consists of 65 items and includes eight subscales. Participants rate severity of stress across several diabetes-related scenarios on a 4-point scale (0 = not at all, 3 = very much). Higher scores indicate higher diabetes distress.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Health-Related Quality of Life as Assessed by Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) 3.2 Diabetes Module</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks intervention, 20 weeks waitlist</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed diabetes-specific, health-related quality of life in children, adolescents, and young adults from pre-intervention to post-intervention. The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 3.2 Diabetes Module consists of 33 items rated on a 5-point scale (0 = never, 4 = almost always). Higher scores indicate greater quality of life.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Perceived Stress as Assessed by Perceived Stress Scale-10 Item Version (PSS-10)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks intervention, 20 weeks waitlist</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed the severity of broad, stressful situations in adolescents from pre-intervention to post-intervention. Participants rank how often each statement applies to their feelings of stress on a 5-point scale (0 = never, 4 = very often). Negative items are reversed and the sum of all 10 items is calculated. Higher scores indicate higher perceived stress.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Psychosocial Impairment as Assessed by Pediatric Symptoms Checklist-17 (PSC-17)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks intervention, 20 weeks waitlist</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed psychosocial functioning from pre-intervention to post-intervention. Participants rate how frequently each symptom occurs on a 3-point scale (0 = never, 2 = often). Total scores range from 0-34 with higher scores indicating greater risk of psychosocial impairment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Diabetes Treatment Engagement as Assessed by Self Care Inventory (SCI)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks intervention, 20 weeks waitlist</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed to what degree individuals follow health care provider guidelines for diabetes-management behaviors from pre-intervention to post-intervention. The investigators removed the item &quot;how frequently do you come in for appointments&quot; from the study as the measure was not used within a physician/ appointment context. After removing the item, the Self Care Inventory consisted of 22 items and is rated on a 5-point scale (1 = never, 5 = always). Higher scores indicate higher diabetes treatment engagement.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Glycosylated Hemoglobin Percentage</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks intervention, 20 weeks waitlist</time_frame>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Engagement with the Scaled Mindfulness-Based Intervention as Assessed by Number of Weekly Surveys Completed.</measure>
    <time_frame>20 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed the number of weekly surveys each participant completed during the intervention period. Participants were asked to complete at least 6 out of the 10 weekly surveys during the intervention period to be considered highly engaged.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility of the Scaled Mindfulness-Based Intervention as Assessed by Participant Feedback</measure>
    <time_frame>20 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed the acceptability and feasibility of a mindfulness-based intervention for teens with type 1 diabetes by examining participant feedback on reasons for attrition and low engagement. Weekly feedback surveys asked about barriers to engaging in the weekly material.</description>
