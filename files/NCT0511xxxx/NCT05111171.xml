  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary angiography is a relatively safe and reliable invasive diagnostic technique,&#xD;
      clinically considered the &quot;gold standard&quot; for diagnosing coronary heart disease. In 1989,&#xD;
      Canadian doctor Campeau performed trans-radial angiography (TRA) for the first time&#xD;
      percutaneous puncture of the radial artery. In 1993, Dutch doctor Keimeneij and others&#xD;
      completed the first trans-radial coronary intervention (trans-radial intervention, TRI) .&#xD;
      After nearly 30 years of clinical practice, the radial artery approach has become the first&#xD;
      choice for coronary intervention and treatment. Compared with the femoral artery approach,&#xD;
      the radial artery approach has the advantages of fewer traumas, less risk of bleeding,&#xD;
      shorter hospital stay, and patients' early mobility. However, there are also few&#xD;
      disadvantages of the radial access, such as small inner diameter, repeated puncture prone to&#xD;
      spasm, limiting the implantation of larger sheaths to treat complex coronary artery diseases&#xD;
      and postoperative complications such as thickening and stenosis and occlusion of the radial&#xD;
      artery. The incidence is higher, and so on.Previous studies have found that the mismatch&#xD;
      between the radial artery's inner diameter and the sheath's diameter is an essential factor&#xD;
      that causes complications such as thickening, stenosis, and occlusion of the radial artery&#xD;
      after intervention. Patients with coronary heart disease often need to repeat coronary&#xD;
      interventional examinations and treatments. To ensure the radial artery route and avoid&#xD;
      complications such as radial artery occlusion (RAO) after intervention for repeated use. It&#xD;
      is worthy of attention. At present, in clinical ascending coronary angiography (CAG) or&#xD;
      coronary interventional therapy (PCI), most of the radial artery sheath sizes are not&#xD;
      selected according to the diameter of the patient's radial artery. The surgeon is only&#xD;
      subjectively based on the patient's radial artery pulsation strength and coronary artery&#xD;
      pulsation. It depends on the complexity of the pulse pathology. The incidence of radial&#xD;
      artery occlusion reported in previous studies is 5%-38%. Most of these studies only rely on&#xD;
      clinical forearm examination and pulse palpation without vascular ultrasound, radial&#xD;
      angiography, and other imaging examinations to assess catheter placement. The degree of&#xD;
      patency of the posterior radial artery has caused considerable differences in the reported&#xD;
      incidence of radial artery occlusion. However, PCI treatment of complex lesions such as&#xD;
      bifurcation, high calcification, severe distortion, chronic total occlusion, etc., usually&#xD;
      requires a 7F sheath to provide better support and convenient equipment delivery. Still, the&#xD;
      latter has the following problems: on the one hand, patients' pain, vasospasm, and other&#xD;
      reasons can easily lead to failure of the radial artery sheath grafting; on the other hand,&#xD;
      although the 7F sheath is used to complete PCI for complex lesions, the postoperative Radial&#xD;
      artery occlusion is prone to occur, resulting in long-term failure to undergo re-radial&#xD;
      artery angiography or PCI treatment.The innovation of this study lies in the use of&#xD;
      ultrasound and radial angiography for the measurement of the inner diameter of the patient's&#xD;
      radial artery, to examine the distribution of the inner diameter of the radial artery, and to&#xD;
      predict the cut-off value of the radial artery inner diameter for successful sheath&#xD;
      implantation and the inner diameter resection of the radial artery occlusion after the&#xD;
      operation. The point value provides an evidence-based basis for selecting the sheath size of&#xD;
      the radial artery in the future to achieve the clinical purpose of protecting the radial&#xD;
      artery for repeated use.&#xD;
