  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing coronavirus disease,&#xD;
      Covid-19, has spread rapidly across the globe since its emergence in January 2020. As of&#xD;
      January 2021, there are 87.6 million confirmed cases worldwide, with 1.9milion deaths. In&#xD;
      conjunction with this high disease incidence, there have also been reports of Covid-19&#xD;
      related sleep disordered breathing, with up 18% in a Chinese study and 57% in an Italian&#xD;
      study of individuals with Covid-19 reporting sleep disturbance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is a common, chronic condition due to partial or complete upper&#xD;
      airway collapse during sleep. OSA is more common in males &amp; obese individuals, both of which&#xD;
      are more adversely affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, inflammation of the upper&#xD;
      airway, or nasal passages leading to congestion could lead to a compromised upper airway&#xD;
      during sleep and subsequently, obstructive sleep apnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We believe that's SARS -CoV-2 infection, and subsequent Covid-19 will lead to an altered&#xD;
      microbiome in the upper airway. This is turn will lead to worsening nasal inflammation and&#xD;
      congestion, which could predispose individual with previous Covid-19 disease to OSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, OSA is treated with Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) a machine which&#xD;
      delivers pressurized air into the upper airway via a face mask. This keeps the upper airway&#xD;
      open during sleep. When CPAP is well tolerated by individuals, it works well to reduce the&#xD;
      symptoms of OSA. Unfortunately, many patients find it difficult to tolerate CPAP. One reason&#xD;
      often reported for poor tolerance is nasal congestion. We believe that an altered upper&#xD;
      airway microbiome, due to previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, will affect treatment adherence to&#xD;
      CPAP therapy. Secondly, we will investigate if treatment with CPAP therapy causes any change&#xD;
      in the upper airway microbiome.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Nasal Lavage and Oral Wash</intervention_name>
    <description>Nasal Lavage: The nasal lavage will be performed using a spray technique. Using a disposable metered-dose inhaler (100 µl per spray), room temperature saline will be sprayed in one nostril while the other nostril is closed. After 5 sprays, the subject will gently exhale through the lavaged nostril and the fluid will be collected in a specimen cup. The procedure will be repeated a minimum of 8 times and a maximum of 15 times in each nostril. After collection, the sample will be placed on ice and processed within 2 hours.&#xD;
Oral Rinse: Oral samples will be collected using a standardized procedure in accordance with the Manual of Procedures for Human Microbiome Project.Study participants will rinse their mouth (swish/gargle) with 15 mL sterile normal saline for 1 min, and will expectorate the contents of the mouth into a 50 mL centrifuge tube. Sample should be kept cold on ice until processing.</description>
