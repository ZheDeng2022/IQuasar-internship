      This study will explore and map the potential shifts in vaginal microbiomes as a consequence&#xD;
      of a microbial intervention with product FB101 in healthy, asymptomatic volunteer women&#xD;
      screened to have vaginal dysbiosis based on criteria defined by metagenomic sequencing of a&#xD;
      vaginal swab sample. A dose of FB101 will be given on 3 different days and subjects will be&#xD;
      followed for changes in their vaginal microbiomes until approximately 6 months after the&#xD;
      first FD101 dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes a screening visit where all criteria for participation are checked and a&#xD;
      vaginal swab is obtained to check if pre-defined dysbiosis criteria are met based on&#xD;
      metagenomic sequencing. If, and when, all criteria are confirmed, a baseline visit, visit 2,&#xD;
      is scheduled to be performed around day 8 of the following menstrual cycle of each individual&#xD;
      subject. Besides baseline assessments, the subject is randomised to active FB101 or placebo&#xD;
      in a ratio of 3(active): 1(placebo) and the first dose is given. At visit 3 and 4 (performed&#xD;
      on day 9 and 10 in the same menstrual cycle as Visit 2) the following 2 doses are given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In total, 7 follow-up visits (visit 5-11) are scheduled to occur for a period of up to 6&#xD;
      months after the first dose. All follow-up visits will be scheduled to occur around day 8 in&#xD;
      the subject's menstrual cycle with one menstrual cycle in between visits. At follow up&#xD;
      visits, close safety monitoring will be performed as well as metagenomic sequencing&#xD;
      assessment of the microbiota in a vaginal swab.&#xD;

             menstrual cycle length (28 days) after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are post-menopausal, defined as more than 12 consecutive months of&#xD;
             amenorrhea without another known cause than use of long-acting progestin or hormonal&#xD;
             contraceptives.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are pregnant, breastfeeding and/or have been pregnant within the last&#xD;
             two months.&#xD;

             contraception, as outlined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Complete abstinence from intercourse two weeks prior to the intervention,&#xD;
                  throughout the clinical study, until the completion of follow-up procedures or&#xD;
                  for two weeks following discontinuation of the study participation in cases where&#xD;
                  participant discontinues the study prematurely. (Participants utilising this&#xD;
                  method must agree to use an alternate method of contraception if they should&#xD;
                  become sexually active and will be queried on whether they have been abstinent in&#xD;
                  the preceding 2 weeks when they present to the clinic for the Final Visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Has a male sexual partner who is surgically sterilised prior to the Screening&#xD;
                  Visit and is the only male sexual partner for that participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Use of acceptable method of contraception, such as a spermicide, mechanical&#xD;
                  barrier (e.g., male condom, female diaphragm), or contraceptive pill. The&#xD;

                  the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Use of any non-hormonal intrauterine device (IUD) or contraceptive implant with&#xD;
                  published data showing that the highest expected failure rate is less than 1 %&#xD;
                  per year. The participant must have the device inserted at least 3 months prior&#xD;
                  to the first Screening Visit, throughout the study, and 2 weeks following the end&#xD;
                  of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women in same-sex relationships, or who are likely to engage in sexual relationships&#xD;
             with other females throughout the study.&#xD;

             condition requiring treatment that by the opinion of the investigator contraindicates&#xD;
             participation in the current study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants may not be receiving treatment involving experimental drugs. If the&#xD;
             participant has been in a recent experimental study, these must have been completed&#xD;
             not less than 30 days prior to this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have undergone some sort of procedure involving trauma to the cervix&#xD;
             within the last 2 months prior to screening (i.e., IUD removal, cervical cryotherapy,&#xD;
             or cervical laser treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with any known condition requiring regular use of antibiotics, that would&#xD;
             suggest the participant is likely to require antibiotic treatment during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;

             screening.&#xD;

             may be enrolled if stable (&gt;3 months) or existing therapy as determined by the&#xD;
             investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with any social, medical, or psychiatric condition that in the opinion of&#xD;
             the investigator would make it unlikely for the participant to comply with the study&#xD;
             or would complicate interpretation of data from her participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a history of drug or alcohol abuse that in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator would make it unlikely for the participant to comply with the study or&#xD;
             would complicate interpretation of data from her participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a history of gynaecological cancers, gynaecological conditions, or&#xD;
             surgical gynaecological medical history, which, in the opinion of the investigator,&#xD;
             precludes participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with abnormal finding on screening exam, which, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, precludes participation.&#xD;
