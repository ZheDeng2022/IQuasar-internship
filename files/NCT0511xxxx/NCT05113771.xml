      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Provide signed informed consent which includes pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Have a diagnosis of MDD without psychotic features, according to the Diagnostic and&#xD;
             Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5) criteria, based on&#xD;
             clinical assessment and confirmed by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview&#xD;
             (MINI).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Have a history of TRD within the past 5 years as documented by the Massachusetts&#xD;
             General Hospital (MGH) Antidepressant Treatment Response Questionnaire (ATRQ) (5-year&#xD;
             version). That is, within the past 5 years study participants must have had a&#xD;
             clinically meaningful inadequate response (estimated &lt; 50% improvement per&#xD;
             Investigator/patient consensus and documented by the Investigator) to at least two&#xD;
             treatment courses with antidepressant regimens. These must involve at least two&#xD;
             different pharmacologic treatment classes* and have been given at accepted therapeutic&#xD;
             doses for an adequate duration (at least 6 weeks). One of these treatment failures&#xD;
             must have occurred within the current episode.&#xD;
&#xD;
             *Note: Augmentation with an approved agent (eg, quetiapine or aripiprazole) for at&#xD;
             least 6 weeks can be considered to be a separate failed treatment course.&#xD;
             Documentation may be by notes from the treating clinician (documented, dated oral&#xD;
             report is acceptable) or pharmacy records. Reports from a prior clinical trial are NOT&#xD;
             adequate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. To be eligible, patients may be either genotype GG for DGM4 (DGM4 positive) or&#xD;
             genotype AA or AG for DGM4 (DGM4 negative), however most DGM4 negative patients (~85%)&#xD;
             will be randomly excluded by an IRT system in order to achieve the appropriate&#xD;
             randomization ratio of DGM4 positive vs negative patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Pregnancy conception limitations&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Female patients must be postmenopausal or surgically sterile or, if of&#xD;
                  childbearing potential and the partner is not vasectomized (6 months minimum),&#xD;
                  must agree to use a medically acceptable form of contraception from the time of&#xD;
                  signing the informed consent form through at least 60 days following the last&#xD;
                  administration of study drug. If only the barrier method is used, a double&#xD;
                  barrier must be employed. Postmenopausal women must have had ≥ 24 months of&#xD;
                  spontaneous amenorrhea. Surgically sterile women are defined as those who have&#xD;
                  had a hysterectomy, bilateral ovariectomy, or bilateral tubal ligation. All women&#xD;
                  of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test result before&#xD;
                  administration of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male patients must be biologically incapable of having children (eg,&#xD;
                  vasectomized) or must agree to use the above forms of birth control for&#xD;
                  themselves and their partner from the time of signing the informed consent form&#xD;
                  through at least 120 days following the last administration of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Be fluent in the local language.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Male or female aged 18 to 70, inclusive, at time of enrollment.&#xD;

          8. Have a HAMD-17 total score ≥ 21 at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Be willing to discontinue the use of antidepressants at least 2 weeks prior to&#xD;
             baseline (Day -1). For fluoxetine, a washout period of at least 3 weeks for ≤ 20&#xD;
             mg/day and at least 4 weeks for &gt; 20 mg/day is required.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. A history or presence of a clinically significant hepatic, renal, gastrointestinal,&#xD;
             cardiovascular, endocrine, respiratory, immunologic, hematologic, dermatologic, or&#xD;
             neurologic abnormality, or any other condition, that in the investigator's opinion,&#xD;
             represent potential risk to the patient's safety, full participation in the study, or&#xD;
             affect the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of liafensine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Autoimmune hepatitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, untreated hepatitis C, active&#xD;
             hepatitis B, or any other uncontrolled or unstable liver disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. One or more clinical laboratory evaluations are outside the reference range, at&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Alkaline phosphatase &gt; 1.5x the ULN at screening. Note: Laboratory tests can be&#xD;
                  repeated to see if values return to within range, but any such laboratory&#xD;
                  abnormality must be resolved by the Baseline Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Clinically significant vital signs abnormality at screening. This includes, but is not&#xD;

             Where legal, prior use of cannabis is permitted provided the patient agrees to abstain&#xD;
             from smoking or ingesting cannabis or cannabis products during the study and provided&#xD;
