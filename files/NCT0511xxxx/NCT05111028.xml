      Purpose of this study is to compare the reversal responses of 4°C cold stored platelets (CSP)&#xD;
      versus 7 day, 22°C room temperature stored platelets (RTP) when given to healthy adult&#xD;
      subjects who have received a loading dose of aspirin antiplatelet therapy.&#xD;

    <description>Each research subject will participate in two study periods that will crossover from one storage product to the other storage product (Cold Stored Platelets vs Room Temperature Platelets) based on the randomization assignment. In Period 1 subjects will undergo an apheresis platelet collection, aspirin dosing, transfusion of their autologous platelets, and followed by platelet response testing and safety assessments. This is repeated in Period 2 using the other storage product. CSP is the the experimental comparator and RTP is the active comparator.</description>
