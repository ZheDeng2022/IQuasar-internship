    <textblock>
      Cross-sectional observational study to improve MRI data acquisition techniques by optimising&#xD;
      MRI sequences for multiple organs and assessing the repeatability and reproducibility of&#xD;
      multiparametric MRI, in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a cross-sectional, observational study recruiting up to 200 healthy participants&#xD;
      designed at improving MRI data acquisition techniques by optimising MRI sequences and&#xD;
      assessing different aspects of the repeatability and reproducibility of multiparametric MRI.&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from Perspectum's own networks, as well as through&#xD;
      advertisements on social media platforms (e.g. Facebook, Instagram), Perspectum's website, as&#xD;
      well as through charities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Suitable participants will be invited to attend a screening visit, normally over the&#xD;
      telephone, which will involve collection of participant's self-reported medical evaluation to&#xD;
      assess eligibility according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria.Visit 1 will consist of&#xD;
      the collection of basic anthropometric measurements (e.g. height, weight, waist&#xD;
      circumference), a medical history, and a MRI scan. Visit 2 will be a repeat of Visit 1.&#xD;

             electronic implants including cochlear implants, infusion pumps, and pacemakers,&#xD;
             shrapnel injury, severe claustrophobia, allergic reaction to contrast agents).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other cause, including a significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of&#xD;
             the investigator, may either put the participant at risk because of participation in&#xD;
             the study, or may influence the participant's ability to participate in the study.&#xD;
