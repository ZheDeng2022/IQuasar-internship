  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Regorafenib is an investigational drug that works by interrupting the rapid and uncontrolled&#xD;
      growth of cancer cells by stopping the signals that tell the cancer cells to grow and the&#xD;
      ability of the cancer cells to form new blood vessels which they need to be able to grow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicities. For&#xD;
      participants with a complete response to therapy, maintenance therapy with both drugs will be&#xD;
      continued for 12 months.&#xD;
