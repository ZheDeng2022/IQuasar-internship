  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, two-arm study designed to measure the effectiveness of&#xD;
      the SELENE system in reducing the number of unaddressed positive margins in breast lumpectomy&#xD;
      procedures when used in addition to standard intraoperative margin assessment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Optical coherence tomography (OCT) -- the optical analogue of high-frequency ultrasound -- is&#xD;
      well suited for operative suite decision making because it offers real-time, high-resolution&#xD;
      tissue imaging with a penetration depth up to 2 mm. The 2 mm depth of penetration is&#xD;
      sufficient to accommodate the current national US (and international) guidelines which state&#xD;
      that following resection there should be no tumor &quot;on ink&quot; for invasive cancer and not less&#xD;
      than a 2 mm margin for DCIS in the absence of invasive disease. Recently, automated image&#xD;
      analysis has demonstrated the potential to both improve diagnostic accuracy and reduce&#xD;
      overall assessment time. OCT combined with deep learning algorithms has the potential to aid&#xD;
      surgeons in identifying regions of interest on scanned samples, enabling them to make key&#xD;
      decisions on margin status intraoperatively.&#xD;
