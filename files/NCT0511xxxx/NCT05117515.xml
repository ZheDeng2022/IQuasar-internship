  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Uni-Graft® K DV Patch is marketed in Europe since 1999 for reconstructive interventions of&#xD;
      the deep femoral, femoral and iliac artery and was also indicated for carotid interventions&#xD;
      until 01/2020. Previous studies focused on the clinical performance of different patch&#xD;
      materials used for patch angioplasty in different indications, without specifying the product&#xD;
      or manufacturer. Thus, it is not surprising that there is a limited amount of published&#xD;
      literature available describing the use of the Uni-Graft® K DV Patch in the clinical routine.&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim of the present non-interventional study (NIS) is to close this gap by&#xD;
      collecting and evaluating existing safety and performance data documented in the clinical&#xD;
      routine especially during the application of the Uni-Graft® K DV Patch.&#xD;
