  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with cancer are more likely than those without cancer to develop blood clots (deep&#xD;
      vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism), which are treated using blood thinners&#xD;
      (anticoagulants). When clots occur, cancer patients carry a higher risk of recurring clots&#xD;
      and more likely to bleed on blood thinning treatments. Therefore, it is critical to use blood&#xD;
      thinners that optimize the safety and benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two main types of blood thinners that are recommended. The tablets which are&#xD;
      direct-acting oral anticoagulants and the injections (low molecular-weight heparin). Clinical&#xD;
      trials show the tablets may reduce clot risk but may potentially lead to more frequent&#xD;
      bleeding, particularly in those with certain risk factors such as stomach ulcers, previous&#xD;
      bleeding problems, certain cancer type.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to examine the effectiveness and safety of the tablets versus the injections for&#xD;
      treatment of clots in cancer patients, to better understand these treatments' benefits and&#xD;
      risks.&#xD;
