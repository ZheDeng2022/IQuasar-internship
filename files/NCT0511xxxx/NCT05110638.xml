    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to determine the pharmacokinetics, systemic exposure, safety&#xD;
      and tolerability after daily topical application of SKX-16 (Luliconazole 10% Solution) for&#xD;
      duration of 29 days in a maximal use setting in adults with moderate to severe distal&#xD;
      subungual onychomycosis of the toenails.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects in this open-label study will receive once daily, topical applications of SKX-16&#xD;
      (Luliconazole 10% Solution) in the clinic for 29 days. Subjects will be followed for seven&#xD;
      days after the last application (Day 29).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be admitted into the study after written informed consent has been obtained and&#xD;
