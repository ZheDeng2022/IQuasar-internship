  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrinopathy in women, primarily&#xD;
      affecting the reproductive system, with substantial collateral negative health effects on&#xD;
      metabolic, psychological, and cardiovascular functions. Patients with this syndrome are at&#xD;
      higher risk of developing insulin resistance (IR), obesity, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease (CVD), and endometrial carcinoma.IR and hyperinsulinemia are responsible for the&#xD;
      low-grade chronic systemic inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periodontitis, an immuno-inflammatory disease, is a result of interaction between bacterial&#xD;
      attack and host inflammatory response, causing inflammation of supporting tissues of the&#xD;
      teeth leading to tissue destruction and tooth loss. Chronic low-grade inflammation is&#xD;
      emerging as a plausible etiologic mechanism linking periodontal disease and many systemic&#xD;
      diseases. Previous cross-sectional studies described a possible relationship between PCOS and&#xD;
      periodontitis and the impact of PCOS on gingival inflammation and vice-versa in terms of&#xD;
      increased inflammatory markers (hsCRP, IL-6, IL-17 and TNF-α). In PCOS females, there is an&#xD;
      alteration of various hormone levels in the body. Female sex steroid hormones play a key role&#xD;
      in periodontal disease progression and periodontal and implant wound healing. Human gingiva&#xD;
      has the capacity to metabolize hormones such as estrogen and progesterone. Moreover, gingival&#xD;
      tissue exhibits receptors for such hormones and it is considered as a target organ for their&#xD;
      direct action. These hormones might act on gingival cells by changing the effectiveness of&#xD;
      the epithelial barrier to bacterial injury or by affecting the collagen maintenance and&#xD;
      repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To avoid periodontal implications as these hormonal changes can worsen the vulnerability to&#xD;
      plaque-induced periodontal disease. So, present study is going to conduct in females with&#xD;
      PCOS and periodontitis at different age groups like adolescent and adult age groups. AIM -&#xD;
      Assessment of impact of polycystic ovary syndrome on periodontal status of women of&#xD;
      adolescent and adult age groups.&#xD;

      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrinopathy in women, primarily&#xD;
      affecting the reproductive system, with substantial collateral negative health effects on&#xD;
      metabolic, psychologic, and cardiovascular functio ns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a complex disease with characteristics of hyperandrogenism and chronic anovulation (CA)&#xD;
      with global prevalence ranging from 2.2% to 26% in Western countries, 2% to 7.5% in China,&#xD;
      6.3% in Sri Lanka,and 9.13% to 36% in India.Patients with this syndrome are at higher risk of&#xD;
      developing insulin resistance (IR), obesity, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and&#xD;
      endometrial carcinoma IR and hyperinsulinemia are responsible for the low-grade chronic&#xD;
      systemic inflammation. Periodontitis, an immunoinflammatory disease, is a result of&#xD;
      interaction between bacterial attack and host inflammatory response, causing inflammation of&#xD;
      supporting tissues of the teeth leading to tissue destruction and tooth loss. It has been&#xD;
      suggested as a risk factor for many systemic diseases such as diabetes mellitus,&#xD;
      dyslipidemia, obesity, CVDs, rheumatoid arthritis, and respiratory diseases. Chronic&#xD;
      low-grade inflammation is emerging as a plausible etiologic mechanism linking periodontal&#xD;
      disease and many systemic diseases. Increased concentrations of inflammatory biomarkers (CRP&#xD;
      and interleukin -6) have been reported in periodontitis and periodontal treatment helps in&#xD;
      decreasing these biomarkers. Timonen P et al. in their cross sectional study demonstrated&#xD;
      association of insulin sensitivity with the periodontal infection but they could not draw&#xD;
      definite conclusions about the role of reduced insulin sensitivity in the pathogenesis of&#xD;
      periodontal infection. Furthermore, Periodontal intervention may improve glycemic control,&#xD;
      insulin resistance and serum inflammatory cytokine levels in type II Diabetes patients having&#xD;
      chronic periodontitis. Both PCOS and periodontitis has been linked to elevated CRP levels,&#xD;
      therefore it is postulated that CRP might be a possible mediator of the association between&#xD;
      periodontitis and PCOS As, periodontitis and PCOS are associated with systemic inflammation&#xD;
      and insulin resistance, these two disorders may be linked through a common pathophysiologic&#xD;
      pathway. Previously conducted cross-sectional studies described a possible relationship&#xD;
      between PCOS and periodontitis and the impact of PCOS on gingival inflammation and vice-versa&#xD;
      in terms of increased inflammatory markers (hsCRP, IL-6, IL-17 and TNF-α). However, they have&#xD;
      not evaluated the effect of periodontal therapy on systemic inflammation and insulin&#xD;
      resistance in PCOS women suffering with periodontitis. It was hypothesized that periodontitis&#xD;
      and insulin resistance may add to the systemic inflammatory burden and may consequently&#xD;
      contribute to progression of PCOS and vice -versa. So, controlling systemic inflammatory&#xD;
      burden by scaling and root planing and medical treatment may have an effect in the management&#xD;
      of PCOS women ha ving periodontitis. Therefore, the study was attempted to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of non-surgical periodontal therapy along with medical treatment on hsCRP, Homeostatic&#xD;
      Model Assessment (HOMA) and periodontal parameters in PCOS women having periodontitis.&#xD;
      Available evidence suggests that oxidative stress may be a common link for the association&#xD;
      between periodontitis and components of the metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and CVD. Both&#xD;
      nitrites and nitrates, which appear in nitric oxide (NO) metabolism, and myeloperoxidase&#xD;
      (MPO) are considered to reflect the strength of oxidative stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM - assessment of impact of polycystic ovary syndrome on periodontal status of women of&#xD;
      adolescent and adult age groups. A cross-sectional study PRIMARY OBJECTIVES Comparative&#xD;
      evaluation of periodontal parameters like Bleeding on probing(BOP), probing pocket&#xD;
      depth(PPD), clinical attachment level(CAL)in both groups. Comparative evaluation of serum&#xD;
      hsCRP levels( high sensitivity C reactive proteins) in both the groups. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
      Assessment of Plaque index, Gingival index, Gingival phenotype, Gingival recession, Education&#xD;
      status, Socio-economic status, Anthropometric parameters. Objectives Outcome Method of&#xD;
      measurement of outcome Comparative evaluation of periodontal parameters( BOP, PD, CAL,PI, GI)&#xD;
      in both the groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present cross-sectional study will be conducted in the Department of periodontology, Post&#xD;
      Graduate Institute of Dental Sciences, Rohtak in collaboration with Department of Obstetrics&#xD;
      and Gynaecology Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Rohtak&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.PLAQUE INDEX(PI)- Plaque index by Silness and Loe 43(1964) will be used for assessment of&#xD;
      plaque. For the scoring, a mouth mirror, an explorer and a light source will be used on air&#xD;
      dried teeth and gingiva. GINGIVAL INDEX (GI) : Lӧe and Silness-Gingival Index by Loe and&#xD;
      Silness (1963) will be used. 3.BLEEDING ON PROBING (BOP):BOP will be recorded as 1 (present)&#xD;
      if it occurred within 15 sec of probing and 0 (absent) if no bleeding occurred. It will be&#xD;
      calculated in %.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After adding all the scores, total score will be divided by the total no. of surfaces&#xD;
      accessed and multiplied by 100. It will be designed as % sites with bleeding on probing.&#xD;
      4.PROBING POCKET DEPTH (PPD):Probing pocket depth will be measured as the distance from the&#xD;
      gingival margin to the base of the clinical pocket. The probing depth measurements will be&#xD;
      assessed using a calibrated manual periodontal probe (PCP-UNC 15Hu-Friedy, Chicago, IL, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. CLINICAL ATTACHMENT LEVEL (CAL): Clinical Attachment Level will be measured as the&#xD;
      distance between the base of the clinical pocket and the cemento-enamel&#xD;
      junction(CEJ).Measurements will be made at 6 sites of involved tooth- mesio-buccal,&#xD;
      mid-buccal, disto-buccal, mesio-lingual, mid-lingual, disto-lingual using UNC-15 probe.&#xD;
      Measurements will be rounded to the nearest whole millimetre. Distance of base of the pocket&#xD;
      from gingival margin, distance of free gingival margin from CEJ. 6. Gingival health&#xD;
      (According to AAP,2017 classification) 7. Gingivitis (Dental plaque induced)-According to&#xD;
      AAP,2017 classification&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.SURVEILLANCE OF PERIODONTITIS( According to AAP,2017 classification) Radiographs (if&#xD;
      needed) for evaluation of staging and grading of periodontitis. (According to AAP, 2017&#xD;
      classification) 9. Gingival phenotype Thin scalloped biotype in which there is a greater&#xD;
      association with slender triangular crown, subtle cervical convexity, interproximal contacts&#xD;
      close to the incisal edge and a narrow zone of KT, clear thin delicate gingiva, and a&#xD;
      relatively thin alveolar bone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thick flat biotype showing more square-shaped tooth crowns, pronounced cervical convexity,&#xD;
      large interproximal contact located more apically, a broad zone of KT, thick, fibrotic&#xD;
      gingiva, and a comparatively thick alveolar bone. Thick scalloped biotype showing a thick&#xD;
      fibrotic gingiva, slender teeth, narrow zone of KT, and a pronounced gingival scalloping. 10.&#xD;
      Gingival recession It is defined as the apical shift of the gingival margin with respect to&#xD;
      the cemento-enamel junction (CEJ); it is associated with attachment loss and with exposure of&#xD;
      the root surface to the oral environment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cairo, 2011:&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to American Academy of Periodontology and European Federation of&#xD;
      Periodontology,2017 classification. 11. Analyses of Anthropometric Parameters,Waist&#xD;
      circumference (WC) will be measured in centimetres, at the midpoint between the lower margin&#xD;
      of the lowest palpable rib and the top of the iliac crest. For waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), hip&#xD;
      circumference will be measured around the widest portion of the buttocks. BMI(Kg/m²) will be&#xD;
      recorded as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. 12.Blood Sampling- Blood&#xD;
      samples for the investigation of serum hsCRP will be collected after overnight fasting.&#xD;
      Venous blood from the antecubital vein will be collected after applying a tourniquet in plain&#xD;
      tubes without additive. Serum hsCRP levels will be assessed using a kit‡ with high&#xD;
      sensitivity methodology in an auto-analyzer§ according to the manufacturer's instructions.&#xD;
      The test principle will be particle-enhanced immune-turbidimetric assay, in which human CRP&#xD;
      agglutinates with latex particles coated with monoclonal anti-CRP antibodies. The turbidity&#xD;
      induced by the formation of immune complexes will be measured at 546 nm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lower detection limit for the assay was 0.15 mg/L. Serum Testosterone levels (if&#xD;
      required) 13. PCOSQ (Polycystic ovary syndrome questionnaire)- Given by Cronin et al. for&#xD;
      psychological status and quality of life. 14. Phenotype of PCOS- According to Rotterdam&#xD;
      criteria and AE-PCOS Society criteria.&#xD;
