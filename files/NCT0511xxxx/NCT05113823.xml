  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to determine the role of in situ simulation training during a pandemic by&#xD;
      using standard and high-fidelity mannequins to improve interprofessional communication,&#xD;
      skills, and teamwork in transferring critically ill COVID-19 patients.&#xD;

      Fourty subjects were randomly allocated into two large groups, the High Fidelity Simulator&#xD;
      group and the Low Fidelity Simulator group. Each group was divided into small groups, consist&#xD;
      of 2 doctors and 3 nurses. All subjects underwent the same interactive lectures, and two&#xD;
      sessions of in-situ simulation according to their assign group. In-situ simulation and&#xD;
      debriefing were performed by implementing appropriate personal protective equipment and&#xD;
      social distancing. At the end of each simulation session, each group would underwent a&#xD;
      debriefing session, which was performed by an experience instructor. The first simulation was&#xD;
      aimed to teach participants skills and steps in transporting critically-ill COVID-19 patients&#xD;
      according to the hospital check-list. While the second simulation was aimed to assess skills,&#xD;
      team work and communication that participants had learned from the previous simulation, by&#xD;
      using assessment tools that had been developed before. In addition to comparing each point in&#xD;
      the assessment tool between the two groups, the points that had been earned were also added&#xD;
      up to get the overall points for total skills, cooperation and communication score. At the&#xD;
      end of the session, learner immediate feedback were also collected using an online feedback&#xD;
      form, which provided accountability for attendance, content learning, and course evaluation&#xD;
      feedback.&#xD;
