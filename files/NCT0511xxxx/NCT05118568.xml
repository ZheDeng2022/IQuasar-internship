      Study to assess the capability of using the Histolog Scanner, a recent large field-of-view&#xD;
      confocal laser scanning medical imaging device for the breast cancer detection in fresh&#xD;
      lumpectomy margins.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. For early-stage breast cancers,&#xD;
      breast-conserving surgery (BCS) is applied to excise the tumor while saving surrounding&#xD;
      healthy tissue as much as possible to avoid radical excisions and achieve better aesthetic&#xD;
      and psychological outcomes for the patient. This surgical approach requires postoperative&#xD;
      tumor-free margin assessment of the surgical resection in order to carry on with next steps&#xD;
      of the patient care treatment (e.g. radiotherapy). Unfortunately, at least 20% of patient&#xD;
      undergo more than one procedure to achieve acceptable margin status due to difficulties to&#xD;
      identify subclinical and deep-seated tumor during BCS. During the surgery, the surgeon mainly&#xD;
      relies on nonspecific visual changes and manual palpation of subtle irregularities to guide&#xD;
      cancer excision. While these determinants enable bulk tumor assessment, they do not offer the&#xD;
      information to adequately identify tumor infiltrates on lumpectomy margin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An efficient intraoperative assessment of the margin may solve these issues and confocal&#xD;
      imaging has shown some promises by providing real-time imaging of fresh tissue with the&#xD;
      resolution sufficient to visualize microscopic tissue features. The Histolog Scanner is a&#xD;
      recent confocal microscope designed for clinical use on large surgical specimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to confirm that the use of the Histolog Scanner by&#xD;
      surgeons allows to detect breast cancer on lumpectomy margins and compare the performance of&#xD;
      the detection with local standard-of-care intraoperative imaging techniques (ultrasound and&#xD;
      radiography) using the final assessment performed in pathology as reference.&#xD;
