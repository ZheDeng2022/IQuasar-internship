  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the Phase 1 portion is to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the&#xD;
      recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of NKT2152. The Phase 2 portion will evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
      NKT2152 in ccRCC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2 open label multicenter study of NKT2152. Phase 1 is a first in human&#xD;
      (FIH) dose escalation study in patients aged 18 years or older with clear cell renal&#xD;
      carcinoma (ccRCC) who have exhausted available standard therapy as determined by the&#xD;
      investigator. Eligible patients will have received &lt;=4 prior lines lines of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 is designed to determine the MTD and/or RP2D of NKT2152 as a single agent&#xD;
      administered orally once daily. Depending on the tolerability and PK, additional dosing&#xD;
      schedules may be tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 will evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and antitumor efficacy of NKT2152 in ccRCC&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
