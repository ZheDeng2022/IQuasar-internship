  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to investigate the injury panorama of acute and overuse&#xD;
      injuries in women and men who regularly participate padel. The intention is to provide&#xD;
      insights on injury prevalence, injury location, injury consequences, gender differences and&#xD;
      risk factors .&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted as a retrospective cohort study where the participants consist&#xD;
      of female and male padle players, both at the recreational and competition level, with at&#xD;
      least 6 months' experience in the sport. The information from this project can be valuable in&#xD;
      the work of identifying risk factors for padle injuries and injury prevention strategies.&#xD;

      Study design and participants This study will be conducted as an observational study using a&#xD;
      retrospective survey. The participants will consist of padle players at both recreational and&#xD;
      competitive level. An estimated 300 players will participate (~ 50% women). Recruitment will&#xD;
      take place through inquiries via padle associations, social media and information flyers&#xD;
      posted on padle courts around the Stockholm and Kalmar region. The survey will be aimed at&#xD;
      all regularly active women and men padle players, aged 18-65, with at least 6 months'&#xD;
      experience in the sport. Players with &lt;1 hour of padle training per week will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure During the autumn of 2021, data collection will start for the retrospective part&#xD;
      and then continue for about 3 months. Injury registration will be carried out using a&#xD;
      web-designed registration form (SurveyMonkey®). The survey is designed with a previously&#xD;
      developed form for acute injuries and with the help of the online survey OSTRC Overuse Injury&#xD;
      Questionnaire for injuries of an overuse nature. The participant will register any&#xD;
      musculoskeletal injury and complaints that have occurred during the last 6 months. The&#xD;
      players will also provide information about age, gender, number of training hours per week&#xD;
      and experience of padle and other training routines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Injury definition The injuries will be classified as either traumatic, i.e., the player could&#xD;
      define a specific sudden onset of pain with a defined trauma included, or as due to overuse.&#xD;
      The severity of the injury will be graded by the time of absence from training and match&#xD;
      participation. The injuries will be divided into three categories. ''Minor'' is defined as an&#xD;
      injury leading to an absence from training/matches of no more than 1 week. Injury leading to&#xD;
      an absence of 2-4 weeks is defined as ''moderate''. ''Major'' is defined as an injury leading&#xD;
      to an absence of more than 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements The OSTRC survey was developed in Norway and has been translated and validated&#xD;
      into Swedish. The sensitivity of this survey is assumed to be much greater than traditional&#xD;
      questionnaires about injuries in sports and enables more overload injuries to be identified.&#xD;
      In addition, the survey registers the extent of injury prevention strategies as well as&#xD;
      training frequency, intensity, amount and type of training. The body regions that will be&#xD;
      registered are neck, shoulder, elbow, hand/wrist, thoracic spine, lumbar spine, hip, thighs,&#xD;
      knees and lower legs and foot/ankle. Participants will also estimate the severity of the&#xD;
      problems on ordinal scale ranging from 0-4, where &quot;0&quot; is referring to no problem, for each&#xD;
      body region. The acute injuries will be registered using previously developed forms for acute&#xD;
      injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics Statistics will be calculated using SPSS®25.0 (IBM SPSS Statistics, New York,&#xD;
      USA). Descriptive statistics (mean ± SD and range) will be calculated for each variable. To&#xD;
      compare means between the groups (women and men, age groups, recreational versus competitive&#xD;
      players), independent student T-tests will be used. Fisher's exact test will be used to&#xD;
      compare different injury location between groups. Pearson's correlation coefficient will be&#xD;
      used to assess associations between variables.To calculate if data is normally distributed,&#xD;
      in the retrospective part, a Shapiro-Wilks test of normality will be performed. The level of&#xD;
      significance will be set at p&lt;0.05.&#xD;
