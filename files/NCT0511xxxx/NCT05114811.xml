    <textblock>
      Perineal massage increases elasticity of myofascial perineal tissue and decreases the burning&#xD;
      and perineal pain during labour, thus optimizing child birth, although an application&#xD;
      protocol has not been standardized yet. The objective of this non-randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      is to determine the efficiency of massage in perineal tear and urinary incontinence&#xD;
      prevention and identification of possible differences in massage application. The sample&#xD;
      target is to exceed 75 women analysed between January and May 2020. The interventions&#xD;
      include: (a) perineal massage and EPI-NO® device group, applied by an expert physiotherapist;&#xD;
      (b) self-massage group, where women were instructed to apply perineal massage in domestic&#xD;
      household; and (c) a control group, which received ordinary obstetric attention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approval for the study was obtained through the Ethics Committee of the University of Leon&#xD;
      (code: ETICA-ULE-021-2018). All participants signed an informed consent form, in accordance&#xD;
      with the Declaration of Helsinki (rev. 2013), and had the option to revoke their&#xD;
      participation in the study at any time. Ethical regulations were respected as well as the&#xD;
      Spanish Law for Protection Data Organic Law and for Biomedical Research in Human&#xD;
      Participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection took place during an evaluation session on the fifth- or sixth- postpartum&#xD;
      week through a self-reported form where participants registered the characteristics of&#xD;
      delivery (gestation week, baby's weight, duration and posture of delivery, tear, episiotomy,&#xD;
      use of equipment and/or analgesia). The form also included a question on intensity of&#xD;
      perineal pain at the time of evaluation (quantified by visual analogue scale) and and urinary&#xD;
      incontinence incidence through ICIQ-SF (punctuation higher than 0) and description (quantity&#xD;
      of loss of urine and how this affects to their daily life), identified on the items included&#xD;
      on the questionnaire.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This non-randomized controlled trial has the sample target of 75 women analysed, at least,&#xD;
      between January and May 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following inclusion criteria were defined to participate in the study: (a) women between&#xD;
      18 and 40 years of age; (b) full term delivery (37th week or more); (c) single gestation and&#xD;
      with cephalic presentation; (d) pregnancy with no complications, nor added risks during&#xD;
      gestation; (e) no participation in any other psychoprophylaxis intervention; (f) deliver at&#xD;
      the Hospital Nuestra Señora de Sonsoles (Spain). The following exclusion criteria were&#xD;
      simultaneously defined: (a) any contraindication for perineal massage and/or vaginal&#xD;
      delivery; (b) medical diagnosis of any urogynecologi-cal pathology previous to gestation&#xD;
      process; (c) any records of cesarean delivery and/or history of perineal injury and/or&#xD;
      urinary incontinence; (d) not giving informed consent of participation in the study or lack&#xD;
      of attendance to every programmed intervention and/or evaluation session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approval for the study was obtained through the Ethics Committee of the University of Leon,&#xD;
      Spain (code: ETICA-ULE-021-2018). All participants signed an informed consent form, in&#xD;
      accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (rev. 2013), and had the option to revoke their&#xD;
      participation in the study at any time. Ethical regulations were respected as well as the&#xD;
      Spanish Law for Protection Data Organic Law and for Biomedical Research in Human&#xD;
      Participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology The interventions include: (a) perineal massage and EPI-NO® device group, applied&#xD;
      by an expert physiotherapist; (b) self-massage group, where women were instructed to apply&#xD;
      perineal massage in domestic household; and (c) a control group, which received ordinary&#xD;
      obstetric attention. Groups were not randomized since the priority was the wellbeing of the&#xD;
      pregnant par-ticipant and were assigned according to the participant's preferences&#xD;
      (attendance at the medical centre for physiotherapy treatment, self-massage at home or&#xD;
      attendance at childbirth preparation sessions only).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection took place during an evaluation session on the fifth- or sixth- postpartum&#xD;
      week through a self-reported form where participants registered the characteristics of&#xD;
      delivery (gestation week, baby's weight, duration and posture of de-livery, tear, episiotomy,&#xD;
      use of equipment and/or analgesia). The form also included a question on intensity of&#xD;
      perineal pain at the time of evaluation (quantified by visual analogue scale).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perineal self-massage intervention Self-massage group received permanent instructions on&#xD;
      perineal massage during pregnancy: it should be applied at least twice a week (on alternate&#xD;
      days) during 10 minutes using a water-based lubricant from the 34th gestation week until&#xD;
      delivery. The position during self-massage should be comfortable and relaxed (recommended:&#xD;
      lying face up or semi-seated position). External massage should be applied in semicircles&#xD;
      (towards the medial) on both sides of the vaginal vestibule and by 'pumping' (rhyth-mically&#xD;
      pressing and releasing) on the central core of the perineum. Internal massage should be&#xD;
      applied intracavitary with the thumb by dorso-central glides on both vaginal lateral walls&#xD;
      (gliding on the introitus vaginae from 8 to 11 and from 4 to 1 clockwise until tissue&#xD;
      relaxation). Then, with the help of the index finger, identify tenser areas on the vaginal&#xD;
      walls (such as thin strings) that could be gently pressed or rubbed and then wait for&#xD;
      relaxation. Finally, apply tissue stretching technique by clamp traction with one&#xD;
      intracavitary finger and other external finger until tension or discomfort, hold the position&#xD;
      until relief and then without releasing, apply traction again. This latter tech-nique should&#xD;
      be repeated three times on both sides (gliding on the introitus vaginae from 11 to 1&#xD;
      clockwise). Participants in the self-massage group received exhaustive in-formation on&#xD;
      massage application and filled in a daily register to check on their ad-herence to guidelines&#xD;
      given and were also checked weekly (at consultation in person or by phone).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perineal massage intervention Perineal massage was applied by a physiotherapist expert in&#xD;
      urogynecology and obstetrics during a total of 6 to 10 sessions (from 34th gestation week&#xD;
      until delivery) of 30 minutes each on a weekly basis. The position of the pregnant&#xD;
      participant is semi-seated, with her back against the stretcher and the legs on the&#xD;
      stretchers' legs. A water-based lubricant was used for massage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment sequence included external massage with two manouvres: vulvar drainage and pump&#xD;
      of the perineum central core. Drainage is a semicircular applica-tion with two or three&#xD;
      fingers towards the medial on both sides of the vaginal vesti-bule, 15 semicircles on each&#xD;
      side, in 3 series of 5 repetitions and moving forward in an-teroposterior direction. In case&#xD;
      of identification of vulvar edema, there should be as many applications as needed. Pumps is a&#xD;
      series of rhythmical pressures with one or two fingers (3 series of 5 repetitions, that is,&#xD;
      15 pumps in total). In case of muscular edema or hypertone, as many pumps as needed should be&#xD;
      applied until normalization of tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intracavitary techniques were then applied through three maneuvers. First, mas-sage with&#xD;
      longitudinal glides on the ani levator muscles, on both lateral walls of the vagina in&#xD;
      anteroposterior direction (following the track of the ischiopubian branches) with the second&#xD;
      and third fingers. There were 3 series of 5 glides on both sides, in-creasing its number&#xD;
      until normalization of tissue. Second, application of treatment of myofascial trigger points&#xD;
      of pelvic diaphragm identified by tense bands or active points that provoked referred pain&#xD;
      recognizable to the patient and/or response to local spasm. In such cases, manual technique&#xD;
      involves inhibition by pressure and/or friction until normalization of tissue and&#xD;
      disappearance of associated symptomatology. Finally, application of manual stretches on both&#xD;
      sides of the vagina (on the area coinciding with a future possibility of lateromedial&#xD;
      episiotomy). The stretching was applied in three stages, moving progressively, according to&#xD;
      the sensations of the pregnant partic-ipant and the elasticity of the perineal muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After application of manual techniques, instrumental massage was applied with the EPI-NO®&#xD;
      device. First, the device should be introduced deflated and once placed in the vagina, slowly&#xD;
      inflated until finding the first barrier, where the pregnant partici-pant manifests sensation&#xD;
      of stretching (never discomforting nor painful). Inflation volume was held until the pregnant&#xD;
      participant noted her sensation of stretching di-minished, then the ball was slowly inflated&#xD;
      again until meeting another stretching bar-rier. Three barriers should be met, and the device&#xD;
      should be moved gently in the search for stretching barriers and local massage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, an external manual technique was applied to relax the perineal area through perineal&#xD;
      global pumping by contacting with the first phalanx of the four last fingers of the hand&#xD;
      (with fist closed) on the vulvar area. 3 series of 5 pumps were ap-plied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety considerations None of the interventions and assessment tools used (applied as&#xD;
      described and as recommended in the available literature) have shown adverse effects after&#xD;
      application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up The research protocol does not include follow-up for data collection. However, the&#xD;
      women participants will be able to go to the physiotherapist who recruited the participants,&#xD;
      who applied the different interventions and who collected the information analysed through&#xD;
      direct consultation in the public health centre where it is expected that she will continue&#xD;
      to work.&#xD;
