  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Today, pregnancy and childbirth are important life events that involve many difficulties and&#xD;
      changes that must be overcome for both men and women. During this process, changes occur in&#xD;
      the pregnant woman's body, emotional state and family life. These changes often cause&#xD;
      pregnant women to experience anxiety about the baby's health and their own health, and to&#xD;
      create new stressful situations. Adding the pandemic conditions to this situation further&#xD;
      complicates the process and it is seen that the fears of women towards the birth and&#xD;
      postpartum period will increase even more. Childbirth preparation classes reduce the fear and&#xD;
      anxiety of women and create a positive perception of birth. For this reason, it is more&#xD;
      important to give birth preparation education to women during in pregnancy during the&#xD;
      pandemic period. However, it is not possible to give face-to-face birth preparation education&#xD;
      to women in this process. For this reason, the aim of this study is to examine the effect of&#xD;
      online childbirth preparation education in pregnancy on worries and fear of birth,&#xD;
      preparation for birth, and well-being of self and baby in the Covid 19 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research is a pre-post test randomized controlled experimental study. The block&#xD;
      randomization method will be used. The universe of the research will consist of women who&#xD;
      applied to Pamukkale University Research and Application Hospital pregnant outpatient clinic,&#xD;
      and have a healthy pregnancy at 24-34 weeks of gestation. The education will be done online.&#xD;
      The sample size was calculated in the G*power statistics program using the data of a study in&#xD;
      which the childbirth preparation education intervention was previously performed (Î± =0.05,&#xD;
      d=1.05). Accordingly, it was found that 16 people should be taken for each group to sampling&#xD;
      for 80% power. Considering that there might be losses, the number of samples was increased by&#xD;
      10% and it was planned to include a total of 36 people in the study. Intention-to-treat&#xD;
      analysis will be performed to manage bias and losses.&#xD;

    <description>The scale will be filled online by each pregnant woman before and after the education. The scale is used to evaluate concerns about the birth process and consists of 10 items. Scoring is done between 1-4. The scale consists of 3 sub-dimensions. There is no reverse scored item. The points that can be taken are min:10, max:40. As the score increases, it is interpreted that the anxiety level of women decreases.</description>

    <measure>Fear of Birth Scale (FOBS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline Fear of Birth score at 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The scale will be filled online by each pregnant woman before and after the education. The scale was developed to measure the fear of childbirth. In the scale, the participants asked the question &quot;How do you feel about the upcoming birth right now?&quot; In response to the question, they are asked to rate their emotions by marking them on two 100 mm lines defined as (a) 'calm and anxious', (b) 'no fear and severe fear'. The cut-off point of the scale is 50 points. It has been defined that people who score 50 and above experience fear of childbirth. The scale can be applied to both pregnant women and their partners. Scoring of the scale: The scores marked on two 100 mm lines are summed and divided into two. The resulting score gives the FOBS score of the pregnant or spouse who answered the scale. Individuals with a score of 50 and above are considered to have fear of childbirth.</description>
