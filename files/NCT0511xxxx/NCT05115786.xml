      A Retrospective Cohort Study to Evaluate a Multigene assay to assess the recurrence risk of&#xD;
      colorectal cancer.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colon cancer is the fourth most prevalent cancer for both men and women and also the third&#xD;
      most common cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The primary consideration in deciding&#xD;
      whether the moderate benefits from adjuvant chemotherapy for colon cancer (a 20% to&#xD;
      25%proportional reduction in the risk of recurrence and death) will be worth-while is the&#xD;
      likelihood of disease recurrence, with larger absolute benefits for higher-risk patients.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, the recurrence of cancer and decisions about its treatment still rely largely&#xD;
      on classic histopathological and immuno histochemical techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to validate a previously developed multigene assay for a more&#xD;
      quantitative approach to predict the recurrence risk and rational individualization of&#xD;
      treatment are needed. A retrospective cohort of stage II and stage III patients with average&#xD;
      5 years follow up after resection surgery will be selected. Formalin fixed paraffin-embedded&#xD;
      (FFPE) tumor tissue collected during patients' resection surgery with either recurrence or&#xD;
      non-recurrence follow-up will be used validate the test. This multigene assay result will&#xD;
      provide a precise estimate of the risk of recurrence and chemotherapy benefit for colorectal&#xD;
      patients to help guide the most appropriate treatment decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three types of patients in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort A&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 20 year or older who were diagnosed with anatomic stage II, T3, MMR-P colorectal&#xD;
      cancer and had recurrence of tumor within 5 years follow-up. FFPE tumor tissue samples must&#xD;
      be collected after surgical resection and before starting chemotherapy or other treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort B&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 20 year or older who were diagnosed with anatomic stage II, T3, MMR-P colorectal&#xD;
      cancer and had no-recurrence of tumor within 5 years follow-up. FFPE tumor tissue samples&#xD;
      must be collected after surgical resection and before starting chemotherapy or other&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort C&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 20 year or older who were diagnosed with stage III A/B colorectal cancer and had&#xD;
      recurrence of tumor within 5 years follow-up. FFPE tumor tissue samples must be collected&#xD;
      after surgical resection and before starting chemotherapy or other treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort D&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 20 year or older who were diagnosed with stage III A/B colorectal cancer and had&#xD;
      no-recurrence of tumor within 5 years follow-up. FFPE tumor tissue samples must be collected&#xD;
      after surgical resection and before starting chemotherapy or other treatment.&#xD;

        This is an exploratory study utilizing archived tumor specimens and demographic and&#xD;
        pathologic characteristics derived from the patient's medical charts. As such, all eligible&#xD;
        patients must have a stored tumor specimen which can be accessed for analysis.&#xD;
