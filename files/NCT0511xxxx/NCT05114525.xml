  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct a descriptive feasibility study of assessing how&#xD;
      patients retain and understand information regarding radiation therapy obtained from an&#xD;
      initial consult visit. This study will also pilot the use of visual aids and assess their&#xD;
      utility to patients during a consult. The study will provide a baseline to conduct larger&#xD;
      studies that will later incorporate additional patient education tools to assess changes in&#xD;
      patient understanding of information received in radiation oncology patient consultations.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will also be asked to rate the ease of understanding of visual aids provided and their utility in facilitating patient understanding of radiation oncology concepts. It will be analyzed via ANOVA to investigate the association of various factors to the patient's total score. Each participant's interview will be scored based on the following scoring system: Correct&quot;=1point; &quot;Incorrect&quot; = 0 point.</description>
