  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The general purpose of this initial study is to evaluate whether parametric PET/CT improves&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment monitoring in select diseases. The specific aim of the HYPOTHESIS&#xD;
      GENERATION study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To obtain and compare parametric as well as traditional static PET/CT images and determine&#xD;
      the number of lesions identified on each type of scan.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis generating study will include a wide range of patients scheduled for PET/CT as&#xD;
      part of either pre-therapy staging or treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most scans will be performed with FDG, with indications for PET/CT including hematological,&#xD;
      urogenital, thoracic and gynecological malignancies as well as patients with suspected&#xD;
      infections and inflammation. We will also include patients referred for PET/CT using other&#xD;
      radiotracers, such as tumour markers (68Ga-DOTATOC, 18F-FDOPA, 68Ga-PSMA, 18F-PSMA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instead of the usual procedure of having the injection of the radiotracer in the waiting room&#xD;
      and having to wait 60 minutes before being moved to the scanner room for imaging, the study&#xD;
      participants will be injected with the radiotracer already laying on the scanner bed and the&#xD;
      scan will commence immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, in this study the patients are still only being scanned once, but we are gathering&#xD;
      PET information in a different way.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a planned clinical standard PET/CT as part of pre-therapeutic staging,&#xD;
             response assessment scanning or evaluation of infection/inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Good performance status, which permits patients to lay still in the scanner for ca. 70&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &lt; 18 or &gt; 85 years&#xD;
&#xD;
