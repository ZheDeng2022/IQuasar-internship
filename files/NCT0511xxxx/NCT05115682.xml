  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical exercise is efficacious in controlling blood glucose levels in individuals with Type&#xD;
      2 diabetes. An individual's exercise capacity and ability to utilize glucose as an energy&#xD;
      source oscillates throughout the day. Hence, the beneficial effects of exercise on blood&#xD;
      glucose levels may depend on the time of day when the exercise bout is performed. However,&#xD;
      the time of day in which the most beneficial adaptations to exercise can be achieved remains&#xD;
      unknown. This project aims to answer the following questions: Does time of day impact the&#xD;
      beneficial effects of exercise on blood glucose? If so, when can the most beneficial effects&#xD;
      of exercise be achieved? Which metabolic mechanisms links time of day, exercise and blood&#xD;
      glucose control? To address these questions, individuals with or without Type 2 diabetes will&#xD;
      perform an exercise session at two different times (09:00 and 16:00), and continuous glucose&#xD;
      monitoring will be used to assess the effects of exercise on blood glucose. We will determine&#xD;
      the specific metabolic processes which promote the most beneficial blood glucose response. To&#xD;
      achieve this, we will measure which metabolic substrates (carbohydrates, lipids and proteins)&#xD;
      are used and which metabolites produced in blood, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue in&#xD;
      response to exercise at different times of the day.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exercise has well-established metabolic benefits and is a preferred intervention for Type 2&#xD;
      diabetes prevention and management. Metabolic determinants of exercise such as skeletal&#xD;
      muscle and whole-body substrate oxidation capacity, glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity&#xD;
      and adipose tissue fatty acid release all show circadian oscillations. These rhythms may&#xD;
      promote substantially different responses depending on the time of day when exercise is&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an exploratory study aiming to determine whether exercise at specific times of day&#xD;
      can amplify the beneficial effects on glycemia and metabolism in twi groups of individuals:&#xD;
      those with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) or Type 2 diabetes (n=40 per group). The primary&#xD;
      objective is to determine the glycemic response to an exercise bout at two distinct times of&#xD;
      day, measured by continuous glucose monitoring, in men and women with NGT or Type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
      The secondary aim is to identify specific metabolites which facilitate the strongest glycemic&#xD;
      response to exercise by examining the whole-body and peripheral tissue metabolomic response&#xD;
      to an exercise bout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of the study is to examine the glycemic and metabolic response to exercise&#xD;
      within-group for participants with NGT or Type 2 diabetes. Further comparisons will be made&#xD;
      between groups with NGT or Type 2 diabetes, across sexes, and by individual chronotype&#xD;
      (determined by a standardized questionnaire) to examine the variation in the exercise&#xD;
      response across these parameters.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The study will include a group of individuals with type 2 diabetes and a group of individuals with normal glucose tolerance. Each group of participants will complete either a morning (09:00) or an afternoon (16:00) exercise bout. After a one-week washout period, the participants will complete an additional exercise bout at the opposing time.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>3 days (1 day before to 1 day after exercise)</time_frame>
    <description>Glucose excursions will be charted using continuous interstitial glucose monitors. The day immediately before exercise will be used as baseline, the day of exercise to assess the acute response, and the day after exercise to assess lasting effects on glycemia. Exercise effects on glucose concentration will be primarily assessed by comparing 24-hour curves between conditions.</description>

    <intervention_name>High-intensity Intermittent Exercise</intervention_name>
    <description>The participants will perform a low-volume, High-intensity Intermittent Exercise bout on a cycle ergometer. Peak exercise capacity of the study participants will be determined on a separate occasion using a ramp-up maximal oxygen consumption test (VO2peak). A single exercise bout will consist of a 7-minute warm-up on a cycle ergometer, followed by 6 1-minute intervals of cycling at individual maximal capacity and 75rpm (rotations per minute). These intervals will be interspersed with 1-min breaks of cycling at low resistance and 75rpm, and the session will conclude with a 3-minute cool-down interval (20 minutes in total).</description>
