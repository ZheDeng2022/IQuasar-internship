  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gestational diabetes is the most common metabolic abnormality during pregnancy. In a Swedish&#xD;
      population 2-10% of all pregnant women are diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus&#xD;
      (GDM). The frequency differs dependent of methods for screening and diagnostic references,&#xD;
      even within Sweden. Women with GDM have about 50% risk to develop manifest type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      (T2DM) within 20 years. Most counties in Sweden have a recommendation to follow women with&#xD;
      GDM yearly with an examination and an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Unfortunately, this&#xD;
      recommendation often fails, partly due to limited resources at the health care units but also&#xD;
      due to lack of compliance from the women. Often after the baby is born focus is changed from&#xD;
      the mother to the child and only 30.7% of the women with one or more risk factors performed&#xD;
      an OGTT, despite stipulated OGTT in local guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnose GDM is under debate and Sweden has started to implement the recommendations from&#xD;
      World Health Organisation (WHO) from 2013 with a lower cut-off for GDM, which will increase&#xD;
      diagnostic sensitivity and consequently increase the number of women diagnosed with GDM. The&#xD;
      plan was to conduct a randomized, clinical trial testing implementation the new&#xD;
      recommendations in Sweden step-wise from 2018 and onwards. The recruitment is now complete&#xD;
      and the results are expected to be published in 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overarching aim of this study is to conduct a randomized, controlled clinical trial to&#xD;
      test the effect of a model for a lifestyle intervention in clinical practice, using technical&#xD;
      support as well as personal, individual support. The intervention is based on the existing&#xD;
      organisation and structure in Primary Care and would thus be inexpensive and straight-forward&#xD;
      to implement. An additive aim is to explore background mechanisms for the development of type&#xD;
      2 diabetes in women with gestational diabetes.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Survey of the field Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) is increasing in the world today and&#xD;
      is strongly correlated to adverse outcomes both for the baby and the mother. The prevalence&#xD;
      differs considerably depending on screening recommendations and diagnostic criteria and is&#xD;
      increased among women with obesity. Both the mother and the child face higher health&#xD;
      challenges, including manifest T2DM, over the years to come due to GDM. In turn, type 2&#xD;
      diabetes increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, nephropathy, retinopathy and&#xD;
      neuropathy. Based on the results of the HAPO study, the International Association of Diabetes&#xD;
      and Pregnancy Study Groups proposed new criteria for GDM in a consensus statement in 2012.&#xD;
      Adopting a one-step strategy would at least double the number of women with the diagnose GDM.&#xD;
      Sweden has started to implement the new diagnostic criteria step-wise in different counties.&#xD;
      For diagnostic criteria, see Table 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Table 1. Diagnostic criteria for gestational diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gestational fP- glucose* 1-hour 2-hour glucose(venous) According to EASD 1991 ≥7.0 mmol/L ≥9&#xD;
      mmol/L&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  10mmol/L (capillary) According to WHO Since 2013 ≥5.1 mmol/L ≥10.0 mmol/L ≥8.5 mmol/L&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. and 2-hour glucose after ingestion of 75g glucose after an overnight fast.&#xD;
                *fP-glucose= fasting plasma glucose&#xD;
&#xD;
      The metabolic demands of pregnancy can reveal a predisposition for T2DM, especially within 5&#xD;
      years postpartum. Women with GDM are eight times more likely to develop T2DM than women with&#xD;
      normoglycemic pregnancies. Risk factors for development of manifest T2DM are common and&#xD;
      well-known; 1) Overweight 2) Ethnicity 3) Low level of physical activity. 4) Heredity for&#xD;
      T2DM. Women with first degree relatives with T2DM have an increased risk to develop T2DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering all the risk factors it is possible to influence both weight and physical&#xD;
      activity and even if women with GDM are called for a follow up the first year after delivery,&#xD;
      they are often left on their own thereafter to implement lifestyle changes and pursue a&#xD;
      healthy life-style. This, while the child/children require care and often are the focus of&#xD;
      the family. The planned intervention is based on already existing routine care added by&#xD;
      information to the nurse at the Child Health Care Centre and a supportive website, specially&#xD;
      developed for women at risk to develop T2DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background to the exploratory aims Women with GDM have demonstrated aberrations in lipolytic&#xD;
      markers in addition to disturbances in glucose metabolism, eg increased fasting blood free&#xD;
      fatty acids (FFA) compared with healthy controls as well as an impaired anti-lipolytic effect&#xD;
      of insulin. Abundance of FFA have also been implicated in the development of type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      (T2DM) and are also an independent forerunner of T2DM in at-risk populations. An infusion of&#xD;
      FFA has been shown to reduce insulin-stimulated uptake of glucose in skeletal muscle.&#xD;
      However, the effect FFA on insulin secretion is not resolved, with both increase as well as&#xD;
      decreased insulin release being reported. Because GDM subjects are at high risk of transition&#xD;
      to T2DM, they constitute an attractive prediabetes group for studies of associations between&#xD;
      FFA abnormalities and markers of insulin secretion and insulin resistance. Although, there&#xD;
      are several reports on the role of FFA for insulin secretion in GDM no study with enough&#xD;
      power has evaluated the relationship in well-matched groups of GDM women and healthy controls&#xD;
      in carefully phenotyped subjects. In this study, the intension is to follow fasting FFA,&#xD;
      fasting C-peptide, fasting insulin and repeated measurements of these variables for 2 hrs&#xD;
      after an OGTT in GDM women out of pregnancy and compare effect of lifestyle intervention with&#xD;
      that of care as usual during 5 years. Thus, metabolically healthy women without previous GDM&#xD;
      who are out of pregnancy will be enrolled as a reference population. In particular, it is of&#xD;
      great interest to test the hypothesis that fasting FFA could be a driver of insulin secretion&#xD;
      in normal fasting glycaemia and whether weight reduction may suppress fasting insulin&#xD;
      (evaluated in part by HOMA-IR) and FFA in parallel. This sheds light on fundamental metabolic&#xD;
      questions in the pathogenesis of GDM and T2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Digital support and coaching Mobile technology has been used to treat a variety of clinical&#xD;
      conditions, for lifestyle interventions regarding physical activity and diet as well as&#xD;
      quitting smoking. For diabetes prevention there are a number of studies with varying&#xD;
      methodology (mainly messages on the mobile phone) and most of them have a relatively short&#xD;
      follow-up time and have focused on changing weight or HbA1c. In a review article from 2017,&#xD;
      the interventions are often assessed as cost-effective. Three success factors are mentioned;&#xD;
      automatic transmission of the patient's measurement data rather than manual entry by the&#xD;
      patient, tailor-made personal messages or the addition of direct face-to-face contact, and&#xD;
      the intervention being in a context where participants can interact with each other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MyMOWO - The application and website used in this lifestyle intervention is MyMOWO&#xD;
      (www.mymowo.com) which is an established company that offers physical training and activity&#xD;
      with over 250 different training sessions of various intensity and scope through digital&#xD;
      management and support. The service can be accessed using modern technology, such as mobile&#xD;
      phone, tablet or computer, via webpage, application or social media. A licenced&#xD;
      physiotherapist at the public health unit in Region Jämtland Härjedalen has together with&#xD;
      MyMOWO developed special training programs for pregnancies and obesity. These groups also&#xD;
      make it possible for MyMOWO's personal trainers to stay in contact with the participants. All&#xD;
      participants in the intervention group will receive access to MyMOWO for free with automated&#xD;
      support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this digital platform links will be given to information films regarding nutrition, the&#xD;
      benefit of lifestyle and physical activity, stress, sleeping habits and tobacco. This from&#xD;
      www.sundkurs.se. These are films by Prof. Mai-Lis Hellénius produced by the Karolinska&#xD;
      Institute and the patient organization Hjärt-Lungfonden and they are used with permission in&#xD;
      this project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned intervention is based on already existing routine care added by an interactive&#xD;
      digital service specially developed for women at risk to develop T2DM, information to the&#xD;
      nurse at the Child Health Care Centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Characterization of the phenotype in the PEPP Diabetes study Medical history, socio-economic&#xD;
      and lifestyle factors: Standard questionnaires will be used to gain information on previous&#xD;
      hospitalisations, on smoking and alcohol habits and on physical activity, leisure time as&#xD;
      well as at work. A well validated questionnaire will be used to report diet (MiniMeal-Q).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physiologic measures: The nurses will measure standard resting blood pressure two times 1&#xD;
      minute apart after five minutes rest with the subjects in a sitting position. (Right brachial&#xD;
      artery, arm in heart level, cuff size adjusted for arm circumference, and reading the&#xD;
      pressure at the closest 2 mmHg). Body mass index (BMI) and waist hip circumferences are&#xD;
      measured using standard methods. All participants will be examined with a bioimpedance&#xD;
      measurement at base-line, after one year and at follow-up. All participants will also have&#xD;
      their oxygen uptake capacity (VO2max) measured with a bicycle test (Ekblom-Bak) and their&#xD;
      physical activity measured with an accelerometer, and a pulswave-measurement will be&#xD;
      performed at baseline, after one year and at end-of-study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical chemistry: Venous blood samples will be collected after an overnight fast. HbA1c,&#xD;
      glucose, insulin and cholesterol (HDL, LDL, total cholesterol and triglycerides) will be&#xD;
      analysed without delay. Aliqouts of blood, plasma and serum will be frozen immediately at -82&#xD;
      degrees C. A standard oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is done in all participants. Insulin&#xD;
      secretion and insulin sensitivity is estimated using the HOMA indexes [37], and for insulin&#xD;
      secretion also the increment during the first 30, 60 and 90 minutes of the OGTT. Further&#xD;
      sera, plasma, and whole blood (for DNA) are stored in a biobank at Gothenburg University.&#xD;
      First-voided urine on waking in the morning is collected to determine the albumin-creatinine&#xD;
      ratio. Samples will be collected at baseline, after one year and at end-of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both women diagnosed with gestational diabetes according to the &quot;old&quot; (before 2013) and &quot;new&quot;&#xD;
      criteria will be included and will be analysed both jointly and as separate subgroups (see&#xD;
      table 1). Power calculation is based on data using the old criteria. Inclusion will continue&#xD;
      until the number of women with gestational diabetes based on the old criteria is included&#xD;
      according to the power calculation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation: Around 30% of the participants are expected to convert to T2DM after 5&#xD;
      years without intervention. The effect of the intervention is expected to be around 35% with&#xD;
      less individuals progressing to T2DM. According to the power calculation a total of 150&#xD;
      participants will be needed in each group for interindividual comparisons between the&#xD;
      intervention and &quot;care as usual&quot; group. Recruitment is planned for three years. Participants&#xD;
      will be randomized to either intervention or care as usual in equal numbers (150 in each&#xD;
      group). The participants will be stratified according to age, BMI and ethnicity. Data from a&#xD;
      number of 150 healthy women with normal with normal glucose tolerance will also be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals progressing to the primary endpoint will be compared with logistic regression and&#xD;
      adjusted for baseline data concerning glucose variables, age, BMI, ethnicity, time in study&#xD;
      and socioeconomic factors. Differences between changes in BMI, waist-circumference, insulin&#xD;
      resistance and HbA1c will be calculated with general linear models (GLM) and adjusted for the&#xD;
      same variables, Differences in quality of life will evaluated using Mann-Whitney test. Women&#xD;
      who get pregnant during the study time will be examined as soon as the new pregnancy comes to&#xD;
      the knowledge of the coordinator and be excluded from the final analyses but will asked to&#xD;
      remain in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from the women with normal glucose will be collected and matched with data from the&#xD;
      women with GDM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially the aim is to conduct a pilot study over one year to test the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study time line&#xD;
&#xD;
      As participation in the follow-up after delivery at the health care unit is often low we plan&#xD;
      to base the intervention on the regular and well-attended meetings at the Child Health Care&#xD;
      Centre. The intervention will be based on information from the Maternity Clinic to Child&#xD;
      Health Care Centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maternity center and two months after delivery. The women will get information orally and&#xD;
      in writing about the study. A metabolically healthy women will be matched and given&#xD;
      information about the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4 months post-partum If the woman agrees to be contacted she will be referred to the study&#xD;
      center and examined with a physical examination and blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examination (by the study nurse):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric measurements: Bloodpressure, body weight and height, hip and waist&#xD;
      circumference. Bioimpedance and pulse-wave measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires: Diet, Life-style, socioeconomic data. Fitness: The Ekblom-Bak submaximal&#xD;
      bicycle test. A accelerometer will be applied during ten days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sampling: Blood samples for plasma glucose, HbA1c, cholesterol (high densitiy&#xD;
      lipoprotein, low density lipoprotein and triglycerides) an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)&#xD;
      will be analysed at once. Samples of whole blood, serum and plasma will be kept and preserved&#xD;
      in the biobank.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If informed consent is signed the women will be randomized to intervention or care as usual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Matched controls from a group of women with a metabolically normal pregnancy will be examined&#xD;
      in parallel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: At all visits at the child health care centre women in the intervention group&#xD;
      will be reminded concerning physical activity and diet and blood-samples will be taken for&#xD;
      fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c, weight and waist-circumference and the nurse at the child care&#xD;
      clinic will give feed-back concerning the tests. The participant will be supported concerning&#xD;
      physical activity and diet at every visit at the clinic on-wards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants in the intervention group will also be informed and given support through a&#xD;
      health coach service in V:a Götaland aimed to support lifestyle changes, and by an&#xD;
      application, MyMOWO to support lifestyle changes, increase their knowledge of&#xD;
      lifestyle-related issues, improve physical activity and dietary habits. The &quot;Hälso-coach&quot;&#xD;
      service may be available in other parts of the country, using other names and will be used if&#xD;
      available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At all visits at the child health care centre the participants in the intervention group will&#xD;
      have their blood glucose, HbA1c, weight and waist-circumference measured. The nurse will give&#xD;
      support concerning physical activity and diet and give feed-back concerning the test results.&#xD;
      The participant will be reminded of physical activity and diet at every visit at the clinic&#xD;
      on-wards (at most once a month). If the women is diagnosed with either IFG, IGT or have an&#xD;
      HbA1c ≥42 mmol/mol the nurse responsible for diabetes care at the health care center will be&#xD;
      contacted for action in accordance with standard of care. The women will keep the regular&#xD;
      controls at the Child care clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Care as usual: This group of GDM women will be provided care according to health care routine&#xD;
      and referred to the health care centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This extensive examination will be repeated 18 months and four years after delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dataprotection Data will be secured in a protected database on a special server in the Vastra&#xD;
      Gotaland. All data will be anonymized and coded. Only the responsible researchers will have&#xD;
      the code.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection will be monitored by an independent monitoring service from the Gothia Forum.&#xD;
