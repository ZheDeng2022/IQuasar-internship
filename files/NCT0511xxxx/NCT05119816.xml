  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kidney biopsy (KB) is an invasive procedure that is very useful in diagnosing kidney disease&#xD;
      in both the native kidney and the transplanted kidney. Patients undergo KB can feel anxiety&#xD;
      and pain. Pain is considered one of the worst experiences for patients and anxiety affects&#xD;
      the sympathetic nervous system, the endocrine system and the immune system. The aim of this&#xD;
      preliminary study was to evaluate the influence of MTI as a complementary/nonpharmacological&#xD;
      intervention on heart rate variability, anxiety and pain and promote more compliant&#xD;
      behaviours during KB.&#xD;

    <measure>State Trait Anxiety Inventory Y-1</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes before biopsy</time_frame>
    <description>State Trait Anxiety Inventory Y-1(STAI-Y1) was used to measure how the subject felt in that moment. Subjects were asked to rate the intensity of their anxious feelings on 20 items on a four point scale: not at all, somewhat, moderately so, or very much so. STAI-Y values &lt;40 defined absence of anxiety, between 40 and 50 mild anxiety, 51-60 moderate anxiety, and&gt; 59 severe anxiety. T0 30 minutes before biopsy</description>

    <measure>visual analogic scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion - 5 mitues after biopsy</time_frame>
    <description>A Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) is a measurement instrument that tries to measure a characteristic or attitude that is believed to range across a continuum of values and cannot easily be directly measured.VAS is usually a horizontal line, 100 mm in length, anchored by word descriptors at each end. The patient marks on the line the point that they feel represents their perception of their current state.&#xD;
The VAS score is determined by measuring in millimetres from the left hand end of the line to the point that the patient marks.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>heart rate variability</measure>
    <time_frame>during biopsy procedure</time_frame>
    <description>HRV is a non-invasive measure reflecting the variation over time of the period between consecutive heartbeats (RR intervals) and has been proved to be a reliable marker of ANS activity.</description>
