    <textblock>
      The study included 40 patients with gastric cancer or gastroesophageal junction&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma with clinical stage T3-4aN+M0; and confirmed after HER2 IHC results Patients&#xD;
      with medium and high expression of HER2 (defined as: IHC 2+ 3+); the neoadjuvant treatment&#xD;
      plan is: disitamab vedotin + PD-1 + capecitabine; the main goal of the study is to explore&#xD;
      The effectiveness of disitamab vedotin combined with PD-1 monoclonal antibody and&#xD;
      capecitabine in the neoadjuvant treatment of locally advanced gastric or gastroesophageal&#xD;
      junction adenocarcinoma, and ultimately provide a basis for the update of treatment decisions&#xD;
      for locally advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma Proof of medical&#xD;
