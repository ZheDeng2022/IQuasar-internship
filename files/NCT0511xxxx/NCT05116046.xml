  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All participants who completed the prior study to assess long-term safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and efficacy, and in the opinion of the investigator, continue to have a&#xD;
      positive risk:benefit profile, will be offered to enroll in this open-label extension (OLE)&#xD;
      study for up to an additional 24 months of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 63 participants will be offered to continue at the previously received dose of&#xD;
      Recifercept either&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low Dose Medium Dose High Dose&#xD;
&#xD;
      or at the therapeutic dose once it is identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will attend the clinic monthly for 24 months. Assessments include safety, blood&#xD;
      sampling, physical examination, vital signs, anthropometric body measurements &amp;&#xD;
      patient/caregiver quality of life questionnaires.&#xD;

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Treatment-Related Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0) up to 24 months after last dose of study medication</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment-related AE was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to study drug in a participant who received study drug. Serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug and up to 24 months after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. Relatedness to Recifercept was assessed by the investigator (Yes/No). Participants with multiple occurrences of an AE within a category were counted once within the category.</description>
