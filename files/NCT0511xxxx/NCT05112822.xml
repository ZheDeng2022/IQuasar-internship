      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To evaluate the effect of treatment with OCA versus treatment with placebo on duodenal polyp&#xD;
      burden (sum of polyp diameters) in participants with FAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety profile of treatment with OCA versus placebo in participants with&#xD;
           FAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effect of treatment with OCA versus placebo on rectal and pouch polyp&#xD;
           burden (sum of polyp diameters) in participants with FAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the effect of treatment with OCA versus placebo on polyp burden (absolute&#xD;
           number) in the duodenum of participants with FAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the effect of treatment with OCA versus placebo on polyp burden (absolute&#xD;
           number) in the rectum and rectal pouch of participants with FAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effect of treatment with OCA versus placebo on serum levels of&#xD;
           Fibroblast Growth Factor-19 (FGF19) and 7 Alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (7AC4, also&#xD;
           known as C4) in participants with FAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the effects of treatment with OCA versus placebo on gene expression in&#xD;
           duodenal, rectal pouch, and rectal adenomas and uninvolved mucosa in participants with&#xD;
           FAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identify differentially expressed genes between duodenal and colorectal adenomas and&#xD;
      uninvolved tissue at baseline and post-intervention for participants who received OCA or&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantify the effect of OCA on the expression of downstream targets of FXR in adenomas and&#xD;
      uninvolved tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantify the effect of OCA on the expression of cancer stem cell markers (e.g. LGR5, ASCL2,&#xD;
      LRIG, BMI) and intestinal stem cell markers (e.g. Villin, KRT20, MUC, LYZ) in adenomas and&#xD;
      uninvolved tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the cell-type specific effects of treatment with OCA versus placebo on gene&#xD;
           expression and abundance in duodenal, rectal pouch, and rectal adenomas and uninvolved&#xD;
           mucosa in participants with FAP via single-cell transcriptomics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effect of treatment with OCA versus placebo on microbiome diversity in&#xD;
           duodenal, rectal pouch, and rectal adenomas and uninvolved tissue in participants with&#xD;
           FAP Compare alpha- and beta-diversity analysis and identify differential abundance in&#xD;
           adenomas and uninvolved tissue.&#xD;

                  obligate carrier.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Clinical diagnosis: FAP phenotype with &gt;100 adenomas in large intestine and&#xD;
                  participant has a family history of FAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Clinical diagnosis: FAP phenotype who are status post colectomy for polyposis,&#xD;
                  participant has a family history of FAP, and 2 FAP experts agree to the&#xD;
                  diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Attenuated FAP diagnosis: APC germline mutation required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have no evidence of active or recurrent invasive cancer for 6 months&#xD;

             or radiation).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event (AE) data are currently available&#xD;
             on the use of OCA in participants &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded from this&#xD;
             study but will be eligible for future pediatric trials, if applicable.&#xD;

             approved protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of OCA on the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic dose&#xD;
             are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to&#xD;
             use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence)&#xD;
             prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman&#xD;

             should inform her study physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior use of study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Duodenal or rectal/pouch polyp burden that is not quantifiable&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically-confirmed high-grade dysplasia or cancer on biopsy at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals with active, known or suspected chronic liver disease including cirrhosis,&#xD;
             nonalcoholic steatohepatitis with liver fibrosis, NASH with cirrhosis, primary&#xD;
             sclerosing cholangitis, biliary atresia&#xD;
&#xD;

             and/or dietary modifications&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Pregnant, breast-feeding, or women of childbearing potential unwilling to use a&#xD;
             reliable contraceptive method. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because OCA&#xD;
             is an agent with unknown effects on the developing human fetus. Because there is an&#xD;
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with OCA, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother&#xD;

             similar chemical or biologic composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any serious and/or unstable pre-existing medical disorder (aside from malignancy&#xD;
             exception above), psychiatric disorder, or other conditions that could interfere with&#xD;
             participant's safety, obtaining informed consent, or compliance to the study&#xD;
             procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants may not be receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;

             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals taking the drugs listed below may not be randomized unless they are&#xD;
             willing to stop the medications (and possibly change to alternative non-excluded&#xD;
             medications to treat the same conditions) no less than 5 half-lives days prior to&#xD;
             starting OCA or placebo on this study. Consultation with the participant's primary&#xD;
             care provider may be obtained but is not required. The use of the following drugs or&#xD;
             drug classes is prohibited during OCA/placebo treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Investigational agents;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Bile acid sequestrants (bile acid binding resins): cholestyramine, colestipol, or&#xD;
