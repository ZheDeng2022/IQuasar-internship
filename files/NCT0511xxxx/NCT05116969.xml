    <textblock>
      This is a double blind, placebo controlled, Phase 1 study of PTX-35 administered via IV&#xD;
      infusion to healthy male and female participants. This study will be conducted in 2 stages:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stage 1 is a single ascending dose (SAD) escalation period in which 5 dose levels of&#xD;
           PTX-35 will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stage 2 is a multiple dose period in which the highest tolerated dose determined from&#xD;
           Stage 1 will be tested in 2 different treatment regimens in 2 cohorts (i.e., 7- and 14-&#xD;
           days dosing regimen).&#xD;

             condom AND one other form of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Established hormonal contraception (with approved oral contraceptive pills&#xD;

             and withdrawal are not considered highly effective methods of birth control.&#xD;
             Participant complete abstinence for the duration of the study and for 1 month after&#xD;
             the last study treatment is acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Female participants who are in same-sex relationships are not required to use&#xD;
             contraception.&#xD;

             contraceptive method from Screening until study completion, including the Follow-up&#xD;

             an effective contraceptive for the female partner that includes: OCPs, long acting&#xD;
             implantable hormones, injectable hormones, a vaginal ring, or an IUD. Participants&#xD;
             with same-sex partners (abstinence from penile-vaginal intercourse) are eligible when&#xD;
             this is their preferred and usual lifestyle.&#xD;
&#xD;
             WOCBP must have a negative pregnancy test at Screening and Day 1 and be willing to&#xD;
             have additional pregnancy tests as required throughout the study.&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Presence of any underlying physical or psychological medical condition that, in the&#xD;
