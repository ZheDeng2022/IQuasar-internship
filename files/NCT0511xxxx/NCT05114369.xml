  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Various factors determine the long term survival in this non-uniform cohort of incidental&#xD;
      gallbladder cancer. Timing of re-intervention is suggested to play an important role in the&#xD;
      outcome. Few centers are proponents of early surgery in order to prevent dissemination, while&#xD;
      others have suggested an intentional delay of 3 months to filter out cases with aggressive&#xD;
      pathology. In the present study, investigators intend to evaluate the factors affecting&#xD;
      survival in incidental Gallbladder Cancer (IGBC) with special reference to timing of&#xD;
      re-intervention.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Surgical Gastroenterology department at our institute is a tertiary referral center for&#xD;
      hepatobiliary malignancies; covering a large part of North and North-east India. The details&#xD;
      and progress reports of patients of Gallbladder Cancer (GBC) being referred to and treated at&#xD;
      the institute is maintained in a prospective manner on hospital data base. This includes&#xD;
      demographic data, presenting complains, details of relevant investigations done outside and&#xD;
      in the hospital, previous surgery, pre-hospital course, operative findings, post operative&#xD;
      course and final histopathology. Being a retrospective analysis of data not affecting&#xD;
      clinical outcomes, ethical approval was not taken. During the study period (Jan 2009 to Dec&#xD;
      2018), 1049 participants with diagnosis of GBC (including 91 IGBC participants) were&#xD;
      admitted; 239/958 participants with diagnosis of GBC and 48/91 with diagnosis of GBC could&#xD;
      undergo resection with curative intent. Information regarding adjuvant therapy, recurrence,&#xD;
      and survival were retrieved through data maintained on follow up out-patient cards till&#xD;
      December 2019. Few participants who stopped visiting the hospital were contacted&#xD;
      telephonically or through letters. All available histopathology blocks and slides following&#xD;
      the index cholecystectomy were re-reviewed by the pathologists in the institute. Tumor type,&#xD;
      differentiation and primary T stage were documented for majority of cases. Interval between&#xD;
      index cholecystectomy and date of re-operation was calculated for all the participants and&#xD;
      divided into 3 groups: Early (&lt;4weeks), Intermediate (4-12 weeks) and Late (&gt;12 weeks).&#xD;
      Primary objective was to assess the effect of tumor characteristics and the time gap (between&#xD;
      index surgery and re-resection) on overall survival following curative (R0/R1) resection.&#xD;
