    <textblock>
      Necrotizing soft-tissue infections (NSTI) are rare and life-threatening bacterial infections&#xD;
      characterized by subcutaneous tissue, fascia or muscle necrosis. Few prospective studies have&#xD;
      been performed and our current knowledge on NSTI is mostly derived from retrospective single&#xD;
      center studies. The &quot;SKin and soft tissue necrotizing INfections in the ICU&quot; (SKIN-ICU) study&#xD;
      is a multinational prospective non-interventional cohort study that will include patients&#xD;
      admitted to the ICU/intermediate care unit for NSTI or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of the study are :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess hospital (i.e., ICU and hospital mortality) and medium-term (day-90 mortality,&#xD;
           functional outcomes and health-related quality of life scores, HR-QoL) outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To report the clinical presentation and microbiological epidemiology of NSTI and&#xD;
           identify independent prognostic factors of mortality and altered quality of life&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Necrotizing soft-tissue infections (NSTI) are rare and life-threatening bacterial infections&#xD;
      characterized by subcutaneous tissue, fascia or muscle necrosis. The mortality of NSTIs is&#xD;
      high, ranging from 9% in non-selected patients to up to 30% in the most severe forms&#xD;
      requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission .&#xD;
&#xD;
      With an incidence of 4/100 000 persons per year, initial misdiagnosis is frequent, with no&#xD;
      reliable diagnostic test available, frequently leading to a delayed surgical debridement of&#xD;
      infected tissues, one of the main modifiable prognostic factors. According to international&#xD;
      recommendations, any cutaneous infection associated with the failure of one or more organs or&#xD;
      showing a dramatic deterioration must include the diagnosis of NSTI for consideration, even&#xD;
      if there is no local sign of the condition being severe. The diagnosis is confirmed by&#xD;
      identifying during surgery deficient tissue, sometimes necrotic, which comes away easily in&#xD;
      the fingers and by the presence of the typical, foul-smelling &quot;dishwasher&quot; exudate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The early management of NSTIs is challenging and requires a coordinated and multidisciplinary&#xD;
      approach. Treatment of NSTIs consists of early broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy together&#xD;
      with emergency and aggressive surgical debridement including excision of all necrotic and&#xD;
      infected tissues. Few prospective studies have been performed and our current knowledge on&#xD;
      NSTI is mostly derived from retrospective single center studies.The few randomized&#xD;
      therapeutic trials testing interventions in this setting have been disappointing, in part&#xD;
      because of the difficulty to identify subgroups for individualized treatments. A large&#xD;
      international study aimed at collecting granular data on the clinical presentation,&#xD;
      microbiology, management and outcomes of patients with NSTI admitted in the ICU and involving&#xD;
      a large number of centers and countries is thus desirable to improve our knowledge on this&#xD;
      devastating condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;SKin and soft tissue INfections in the ICU&quot; (SKIN-ICU) study is a multinational&#xD;
      prospective non-interventional cohort study that will include patients with NSTI admitted or&#xD;
      not to the ICU/intermediate care unit and aim at addressing the following points: 1) Hospital&#xD;
      (i.e., ICU and hospital mortality) and medium-term outcomes (three- and six-month survival,&#xD;
      functional outcomes and health-related quality of life scores, HR-QoL); and 2) Clinical&#xD;
      presentation and microbiological epidemiology of NSTI.&#xD;
