      The aim of this study is to evaluate the outcomes of transvaginal natural orifice specimen&#xD;
      extraction (NOSE) in patients who are planning multiport laparoscopic surgery for resection&#xD;
      of solid organs including kidney, liver, stomach, adrenal gland and bladder.&#xD;

      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was a prospective, single center, single arm study. This clinical trial was approved by&#xD;
      the Institutional Review Boards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study process:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients gave informed written consent after being informed of the details of the study.&#xD;
      All participants underwent demographic and history taking, laboratory tests and a&#xD;
      gynecological examination to determine whether specimen removal through vagina is possible.&#xD;
      The patients who was adequate for this study were planned to perform multiport laparoscopic&#xD;
      surgery and patients were subjected to transvaginal NOSE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To perform transvaginal NOSE procedure, the patients were placed in the lithotomy position&#xD;
      with Trendelenburg position. After about 1-2cm incision at the posterior vaginal fornix,&#xD;
      endopouch was introduced into the abdominal cavity through vaginal incision site. The&#xD;
      specimen was placed inside a endopouch and removed through vagina. Closure of vaginal&#xD;
      incision site was achieved by transvaginally with 2/0 absorbable suture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the second and third visit at 1 week and 8 week, Patient and Observer Scar Assessment&#xD;
      Scale (POSAS) was performed to assess cosmetic outcomes of scar. Subjects with sexual&#xD;
      activity carried out Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) questionnaire to assess sexual&#xD;
      function at final visit which occurred at 6 months after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data are summarized as means Â± standard deviation or as numbers with proportions. A p &lt;&#xD;
      0.05 was considered to indicate significance. Student's t-test and Mann-Whitney U test were&#xD;
      conducted to compare continuous parametric variables and non-parametric variables,&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
