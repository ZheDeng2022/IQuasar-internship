      This is a prospective cohort evaluation of vaccine effectiveness of a single dose of&#xD;
      Typbar-TCV® against symptomatic blood culture-confirmed typhoid fever when administered&#xD;
      through a mass vaccination campaign to children 9 months to &lt;16 years of age in Kisantu, DRC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is conducted in Kisantu, DRC and is comprised of a mass vaccination campaign of&#xD;
      children aged 9 months to &lt;16 years with a single dose of Typbar-TCV® and a concomitant&#xD;
      surveillance study to assess the incidence of culture-confirmed typhoid fever in the&#xD;
      population during a period of three years following vaccination. Safety events will be&#xD;
      monitored for 30 minutes following vaccination for all participants. In a subset of&#xD;
      age-eligible participants living in the study area, the investigators will assess local and&#xD;
      systemic solicited adverse events/adverse reactions and unsolicited adverse events occurring&#xD;
      within the first 7 days post-vaccination and unsolicited and serious adverse events within 28&#xD;
      days post-vaccination. A population census will be conducted at baseline to enumerate and&#xD;
      characterize the population under study and demographic information will be collected to&#xD;
      allow for minimization of potential sources of bias during analysis. An interim censuses and&#xD;
      a census at study closure will be carried out to update population information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the Typbar-TCV® vaccine is effective in large scale&#xD;
      vaccination campaigns, thereby lowering the incidence of blood-culture confirmed typhoid&#xD;
      fever in children. Lessons and experiences on vaccination feasibility and uptake will be&#xD;
      important for informing TCV introduction across the African continent.&#xD;
