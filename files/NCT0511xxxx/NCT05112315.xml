  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      International, multicentre, randomized 1:1 controlled trial to prove the clinical and medico&#xD;
      economic benefits of the medical device Predigraft, by showing that the use of Predigraft&#xD;
      could improve patient's follow-up.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to demonstrate improvement of the prevalence of biopsies leading to&#xD;
      therapeutic change in the Predigraft group compared to the Standard of care group in kidney&#xD;
      transplanted patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that using Predigraft as a monitoring tool will help the physician detect&#xD;
      earlier and more often abnormalities with the patient allograft. This should lead to an&#xD;
      increased number of biopsies leading to therapeutic change. These biopsies should be&#xD;
      performed earlier than without the iBox monitoring tool. This would improve long-term&#xD;
      allograft function, kidney allograft and patient survival.&#xD;
