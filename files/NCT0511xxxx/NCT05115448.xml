  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A patient with an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) receiving chronic hemodialysis (HD) treatment&#xD;
      is cannulated 312 times a year on average. The patients cannot comply with dialysis treatment&#xD;
      and the quality of life is decreased by pain when the fistula cannot be accessed with a&#xD;
      single attempt. Sharp pain depends on the tear in the skin, the tissue where the sensitive&#xD;
      nerve ends receptive to pain are located, and it is particularly important during AVF&#xD;
      puncture. Also, punctures are accompanied by haemorrhages and frequent loss of blood.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The repeated puncture of the AVF leads to a considerable degree of pain, due to the calibre&#xD;
      and length of the bevel of fistula needles. When the fistula needle is removed, the small&#xD;
      punctures that occur in the entrance area are closed with a thrombus. As a result, scar&#xD;
      tissue forms in the entrance area and the surrounding skin, which can lead to the development&#xD;
      of stenosis and aneurysm. For this reason, the needle conical tip direction is important in&#xD;
      terms of delaying the loss of tissue elasticity and prolonging the use of the intervention&#xD;
      area. There are very few studies investigating the effect of the conical tip being up or down&#xD;
      on the pain that develops during cannulation in the patient.&#xD;
