      COPD is a common, preventable and treatable disease that is characterized by persistent&#xD;
      respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation that is due to airway and/or alveolar&#xD;
      abnormalities, usually caused by significant exposure to noxious particles or gases. COPD is&#xD;
      third leading cause of death worldwide. &quot;Ideal cardiovascular health,&quot; a set of factors,&#xD;
      including several directly along the causal pathway of transitions from health to disease,&#xD;
      that protect against the development of cardiac disease. Working definition of respiratory&#xD;
      health are the dual concepts of pulmonary reserve, as reflected by peak lung function in&#xD;
      young adulthood, and susceptibility, as reflected by risk for future accelerated decline in&#xD;
      lung function after the attainment of this peak. There is relationship between physical&#xD;
      activity, disease severity, health status and prognosis in patients with COPD. Common&#xD;
      pulmonary function tests include spirometry, lung volumes, and diffusing capacity for carbon&#xD;
      monoxide (DLCO). Spirometry assesses airflow limitation. Diffusing capacity for carbon&#xD;
      monoxide provides information on the health of alveolar-capillary membrane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be cross-sectional correlational study. It will find correlation between&#xD;
      person's physical activity and respiratory health. IPAQ and 6MIN walk test will be used as&#xD;
      measuring tools of physical activity and FEV1 and TLV for estimating respiratory health.&#xD;
      Spirometer will be used to measure respiratory health. Data will be collected from different&#xD;
      hospital settings and analysed using SPSS software. All ethical considerations will be&#xD;
      followed.&#xD;

      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous and multisystemic disease&#xD;
      with progressive increasing morbidity and mortality. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&#xD;
      (COPD) is a deteriorating respiratory disease with some extrapulmonary effects that&#xD;
      contribute to disease severity in patient. The etiology, in general, involves exposure to&#xD;
      external noxious particles or gases. In the Western world this is particularly a result of&#xD;
      (cigarette) smoking and in the non-Western world it is mainly a result of indoor cooking.&#xD;
      COPD pathology is driven by chronic inflammation, which continues to be observed after&#xD;
      stopping smoking, even after ⩾1 year. The combination of the exposure and inflammation leads&#xD;
      to lung tissue damage, resulting in remodeling of the lung.Global Burden of Disease programme&#xD;
      in 2010 identified chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as the third leading cause of&#xD;
      death worldwide up from 4th in 1990. This high mortality due to COPD is caused due to smoking&#xD;
      and rapidly aging population. China alone contributed to about one-third (0.9million/year) of&#xD;
      all deaths from COPD worldwide. Within China, the prevalence of COPD varies substantially by&#xD;
      region and death rates attributed to COPD are twofold greater in South-West compared with&#xD;
      North-East regions for reasons that are not fully understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical activity in terms of body movements, walking time and standing time has been shown&#xD;
      to be reduced in patients with severe COPD. However, it is currently unknown at which&#xD;
      clinical stage of the disease limitations of physical activity are first displayed.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the relationships between physical activity and clinical characteristics&#xD;
      reflecting the disease severity, such as the degree of airway obstruction, distance walked in&#xD;
      6 min, self-reported grade of dyspnea and clinical stages of COPD, need to be investigated&#xD;
      as, to date, data are inconclusive or have never been evaluated. For example, some studies&#xD;
      have found substantial correlations between airway obstruction and physical activity, while&#xD;
      others found no or only loose relationships. Previous studies indicate that the 6-min walking&#xD;
      distance (6MWD) might best reflect physical activity, while a recent study found airway&#xD;
      obstruction to correlate with physical activity better than 6MWD.&#xD;
