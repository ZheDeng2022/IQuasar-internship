      Healthcare-associated infections are infections that patients acquire during the course of&#xD;
      receiving treatment for other conditions within a healthcare setting and are not present at&#xD;
      the time of admission. Medical instrumentation increases the risk of development of HAIs.&#xD;
      Such devices include, venous and urinary catheters, and ventilators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most ventilator-dependent patients undergo respiratory stabilization with an endotracheal&#xD;
      tube in a critical care setting. Later on, translaryngeal tubes are converted to a&#xD;
      tracheostomy to provide long-term airway access for ventilatory support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tracheostomy is a commonly performed airway surgery for critically ill patients. It has&#xD;
      variable complications, a common one being secondary infection with bacteria and fungi, which&#xD;
      in turn leads- to granulation formation in stoma and on peristomal region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk factor for infection in patients with tracheostomy occurs due to exposure to large&#xD;
      amounts of bacteria because they do not pass through the upper airway defense system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The commonest microorganism colonizing the tracheostomy tube leading to respiratory&#xD;
      infections include Pseudomonas aeurginosa, Acinetobacter baumanii, and methicillin resistant&#xD;
      Staphylococcus aureus, some of these organisms are antibiotic resistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biofilm formation is a unique self-protective mechanism of bacteria, protects them from host&#xD;
      immune response and antimicrobial agents. Studies showed that more than 60% of hospital&#xD;
      acquired infections are caused by biofilm forming bacteria on medical devices. These&#xD;
      infections are most commonly attributed to Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas, and mixed&#xD;
      flora.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are infections that patients acquire during the&#xD;
      course of receiving treatment for other conditions within a healthcare setting and are not&#xD;
      present or incubating at the time of admission. Medical instrumentation increases the risk of&#xD;
      development of HAIs and most patients admitted for health care are exposed to some kind of&#xD;
      medical device in the course of their treatment. Such devices include, but are not limited&#xD;
      to, venous and urinary catheters, and ventilators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most ventilator-dependent patients first undergo respiratory stabilization with a&#xD;
      translaryngeal endotracheal tube in a critical care setting. At some time during the course&#xD;
      of their disease, translaryngeal tubes are converted to a tracheostomy to provide long-term&#xD;
      airway access for ventilatory support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tracheostomy is a commonly performed airway surgery for critically ill patients. It is a&#xD;
      lifesaving procedure done for mechanical ventilation, bronchopulmonary toileting and reduce&#xD;
      pulmonary effort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tracheostomy tubes have a main shaft (cannula) attached to a neck plate (or flange), and&#xD;
      cuffed tubes have a pilot balloon, which shows whether the cuff is inflated. The neck plate&#xD;
      has a slot where ties can be placed, and fenestrated tubes can have a cuff and/or inner&#xD;
      cannula. Their insertion is aided with an obturator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has variable complications, a common one being secondary infection with bacteria and&#xD;
      fungi, which in turn leads- to granulation formation in stoma and on peristomal region. As&#xD;
      tracheostomy tube is an indwelling prosthesis, it provides potential surface for growth of&#xD;
      bacteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In tracheostomized patients, the role of the nose, nasopharynx and upper respiratory mucosa&#xD;
      as a defensive mechanism is absent which allows bacteria to have direct access from the stoma&#xD;
      to the respiratory tract. Infections in tracheostomy stoma, tracheobronchitis, and pneumonia&#xD;
      are common infections that occur after tracheostomy. The risk factor for infection in&#xD;
      patients with tracheostomy occurs due to exposure to large amounts of bacteria because they&#xD;
      do not pass through the upper airway defense system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a 20 fold increase in the development of respiratory tract infection following&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation in tracheostomized or mechanically ventilated patients, the incidence&#xD;
      vary between 4% and 28%. The commonest microorganism colonizing the tracheostomy tube leading&#xD;
      to respiratory infections include Pseudomonas aeurginosa, Acinetobacter baumanii, and&#xD;
      methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, some of these organisms are antibiotic resistant&#xD;
      which in turn increase the morbidity and costs involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tracheal cannula is often be exposed to enzymes, antioxidants and bacteria found in the&#xD;
      tracheal mucosa, thereby accelerating aggregation, increasing colonization of microorganisms&#xD;
      and forming biofilms on the surface of the cannula. The irritation by tracheostomy tube&#xD;
      causes local inflammatory reaction and edema leading to bacterial colonization. To avoid the&#xD;
      lower respiratory tract infection, careful hygiene of tracheostomy is recommended. Using&#xD;
      sterile disposable suction catheters, gentle tracheal suction, bacteria free humidifiers,&#xD;
      less visitors are recommended. However, despite of high level of hygiene, exogenous&#xD;
      colonization with or without subsequent infection is common.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outer cannula of tracheostomy tubes are routinely changed for a number of reasons.&#xD;
      Regular tube changes are thought to aid in the prevention of stoma granulation tissue&#xD;
      formation and tube blockage but are mainly done to reduce the rates of possible infection.&#xD;
      Biofilm formation is a commonly cited reason for regular tracheostomy tube changes despite&#xD;
      little supporting evidence, as they have are believed to cause deterioration in the tube&#xD;
      surfaces. Inner cannulas of tracheostomy tubes act as liners and are changed on a daily or&#xD;
      more often basis to prevent mucous build-up. A clinical consensus statement on tracheostomy&#xD;
      care emphasized that effective wound care for tracheostomy patients has the positive effects&#xD;
      of reducing the infection rate, shortening the time with a tracheal tube and improving&#xD;
      patients' life quality. Gauze or moist dressings are widely used to take care of tracheostomy&#xD;
      wounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biofilm formation is a unique self-protective mechanism of bacteria, as it protects them from&#xD;
      host immune response and antimicrobial agents. Biofilms are complex three dimensional&#xD;
      structures, which are composed of bacteria, living in an extracellular matrix made of&#xD;
      polysaccharides, nucleic acids and proteins. Studies showed that more than 60% of hospital&#xD;
      acquired infections are caused by biofilm forming bacteria on medical devices. These&#xD;
      infections are most commonly attributed to Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas, and mixed&#xD;
      flora.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data regarding the colonization rates of tracheostomy tubes and the antimicrobial resistance&#xD;
      and biofilm forming potential of bacteria colonizing tracheostomy tubes in Upper Egypt is&#xD;
      still lacking.&#xD;
