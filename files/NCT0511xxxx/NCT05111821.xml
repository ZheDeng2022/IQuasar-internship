  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is a major cause of disability over the world. While acute therapies have made huge&#xD;
      progresses, the number of survivors leaving with clinical consequences of stroke is&#xD;
      increasing. Beyond stroke itself, secondary neurodegeneration of disconnected areas,&#xD;
      especially of central hubs such as the substantia nigra or the thalamus, could significantly&#xD;
      impact the overall outcome of the patients. Data have identified iron accumulation within the&#xD;
      disconnected areas as potentially accelerating neurodegeneration. In this research, the main&#xD;
      objective is test whether long-term chelation through Deferiprone (FerrirpoxÂ®, Chiesi)&#xD;
      administered daily from 3-to-5 days following stroke to 6 months could avoid iron&#xD;
      accumulation as measured with Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within disconnected areas&#xD;
      (substantia nigra).&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI imaging methods such as the quantification of the transverse relaxation rate R2* provide&#xD;
      highly correlated information to the histologically measured iron load&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  With a stroke involving the deep territory of the middle cerebral artery (including at&#xD;
             least half of the volume of the striatum) due to occlusion of the carotid artery or of&#xD;
             proximal M1 or M2 segments. The artery can be occluded when the patient is admitted at&#xD;
             the acute phase or already recanalized as soon as the striatum is involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute neutrophil count â¥1.5 x109/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For women of childbearing potential, negative Î² HCG test and highly effective&#xD;
             contraception (oestroprogestative contraception, intra-uterine device, bilateral&#xD;
             salpingectomy) to be continued 6 months after the last administration of deferiprone.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men whose partner provides a highly effective contraception or who accept to use a&#xD;
             contraception method (condom) while treated by deferiprone and to continue 90 days&#xD;
             after the last administration of deferiprone&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent dated and signed prior to the beginning of any procedures&#xD;
             related to the clinical trial. Patients unable to give their personal consent (severe&#xD;
             aphasia, impaired understanding or attention induced by the infarction) may be&#xD;
             included with the consent by a trusted person provided in article L. 1111-6, by the&#xD;
             family or by a person who has a close and stable relationship with the person&#xD;
             concerned. The person concerned is informed as soon as possible and his consent is&#xD;
             sought during visit at 3 month or 6 month if he regains his capacity to consent. These&#xD;
             patients may be included because the treatment may be provided by the caregiver, or a&#xD;
             home nurse for patients alone or for whom the caregiver is unable to follow the&#xD;
             treatment. Most severe patients, in rehabilitation structure will have support for&#xD;

             include clozapine as well as some NSAIDs (e.g. Phenylbutazone or Metamizole),&#xD;
