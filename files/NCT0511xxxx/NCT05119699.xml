    <textblock>
      This study is a single-arm, open-label, feasibility trial for the assessment of the clinical&#xD;
      effects of a course of accelerated bilateral sequential theta burst stimulation (TBS) for&#xD;
      late life depression (LLD). Over approximately 1 year, 30 outpatients at the Centre for&#xD;
      Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) meeting diagnostic criteria for LLD will be recruited and&#xD;
      will receive 5 consecutive days (always Monday to Friday) of TBS repetitive transcranial&#xD;
      magnetic stimulation (rTMS), administered 8 times daily at approximately 1 hour intervals,&#xD;
      with continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) applied to the right dorsolateral prefrontal&#xD;
      cortex (DLPFC) followed by left DLPFC intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo a series of assessments as well as motor threshold testing to determine&#xD;
      the appropriate site and strength of stimulation according to standard methods and then begin&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an evidenced based treatment for&#xD;
      medically refractory major depressive disorder (MDD). rTMS involves direct stimulation of&#xD;
      cortical neurons using externally applied, powerful, focused magnetic field pulses. Dozens of&#xD;
      studies and several meta-analyses over the last 15 years have shown that rTMS of the&#xD;
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) produces statistically significant improvements in&#xD;
      MDD, even when medications have failed. In the most recent generation of randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials, rTMS consistently achieves response rates of 50-55% and remission rates of&#xD;
      30-35% in medically refractory MDD patients. rTMS has been shown to be effective and well&#xD;
      tolerated for depression in younger and older adults. However, early rTMS studies with older&#xD;
      adults were limited by suboptimal stimulation parameters, small sample sizes and insufficient&#xD;
      treatment durations. The optimal parameters for rTMS are still in the process of being&#xD;
      established, however the most widely-used rTMS protocols apply excitatory, 10 Hz stimulation&#xD;
      to the left DLPFC; high frequency left (HFL) or inhibitory, 1 Hz stimulation to the right&#xD;
      DLPFC; low frequency right (LFR), or both. Taken together with the reported findings of&#xD;
      several other groups, results suggest that accelerated rTMS may be feasible, tolerable, and&#xD;
      capable of achieving comparable and potentially better remission rates than longer 20 to 30&#xD;
      day courses. However, all of these studies were small, open-label case series, focused on&#xD;
      younger adults.&#xD;

    <description>Subjects will receive 5 consecutive days (always Monday to Friday) of TBS rTMS, administered 8 times daily at 1 hour intervals. Patients will undergo cTBS of the R DLPFC at 110-120% RMT using bursts of 3 pulses at 50 Hz, bursts repeated at 5 Hz for a total of 600 pulses over 40 seconds, followed by iTBS of the L DLPFC at 110-120% resting motor threshold (RMT) using bursts of 3 pulses at 50 Hz, bursts repeated at 5 Hz with a duty cycle of 2 s on, 8 s off for a total of 600 pulses over 3 min 9 s. Participants will be titrated to 110-120% RMT within the first four treatments to aid with tolerability. If patients tolerate the stimulation well, the target will be 120%. Assessments focused on depressive symptoms will be administered at baseline, after final treatment and four weeks post final treatment.</description>
