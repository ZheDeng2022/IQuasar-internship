  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Silicosis is one of the leading causes of occupational respiratory disease worldwide. It is&#xD;
      due to inhalation of respirable crystalline silica and can lead to progressive massive&#xD;
      fibrosis (PMF), respiratory failure, and death. It is estimated that it causes more than&#xD;
      10,000 deaths a year worldwide, mainly in developing countries, although the level of&#xD;
      underdiagnosis is high. In developed countries the incidence of the disease has been&#xD;
      progressively decreasing in recent years, mainly due to the implementation of effective&#xD;
      prevention measures, better occupational health surveillance systems and the displacement of&#xD;
      mining activity to other countries, in a way that in the United Kingdom 216 cases were&#xD;
      reported from 1996 to 2017. At the moment, there is no curative treatment for the disease,&#xD;
      and the only therapeutic option is lung transplantation (when the disease evolves to PMF and&#xD;
      subsequent respiratory failure). Meanwhile, the only accepted treatment is supportive&#xD;
      treatment, with the administration of oxygen therapy in case of respiratory failure, early&#xD;
      treatment of respiratory infections, vaccinations and respiratory rehabilitation. In recent&#xD;
      years, molecules with antifibrogenic capacity have been developed and have demonstrated their&#xD;
      ability to decrease pulmonary fibrogenic activity in diseases such as Idiopathic Pulmonary&#xD;
      Fibrosis (IPF). This has been a milestone in the treatment of this disease and, therefore,&#xD;
      its possible application to other diseases that share fibrogenic mechanisms with IPF, as PMF.&#xD;
      The two molecules with the most clinical experience and approved for IPF are nintedanib and&#xD;
      pirfenidone. The antifibrotic properties of pirfenidone have raised great expectations and&#xD;
      many clinical trials are currently being carried out in other lung diseases that cause&#xD;
      fibrosis, that is why we decide to study the efficacy of pirfenidone in reducing metabolic,&#xD;
      inflammatory, and fibrogenic lung disease in patients with artificial stone silicosis and&#xD;
      progressive massive fibrosis (PMF).&#xD;

      Hypothesis: Pirfenidone reduces pulmonary metabolic activity in patients with Progressive&#xD;
      Massive Fibrosis (PMF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objetives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objetive: To evaluate the efficacy of pirfenidone in reducing pulmonary metabolic&#xD;
      activity quantified by PET-CT Scan (F-FDG) in patients with Progressive Massive Fibrosis&#xD;
      (PMF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secundary objetives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the efficacy of pirfenidone in reducing pulmonary inflammatory and&#xD;
           fibrogenic activity in patients with Progressive Massive Fibrosis (PMF), quantified by&#xD;
           cell biomarkers, and the relation with the pulmonary metabolic activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess changes brought about by pirfenidone in the different cells biomarkers&#xD;
           patterns and metabolic activity resulted by PET/TC with 18-FDG&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess radiological changes in TCAR that occur after administration of pirfenidone&#xD;
           and the relation with biomarkers and with 18F FDG acquisition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To assess wheter administration of pirfenidone generates changes on standard funtional&#xD;
           respiratory explorations, and the relation with inflammatory and metabolic activity. 5.&#xD;
           To assess clinical changes (if any) and safety of pirfenidone after administration to&#xD;
           patients with PMF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: An Open, Randomised, Controlled, 2 arms and Unicenter Clinical Trial to Assess&#xD;
      the Efficiency of Pirfenidone for the Reduction of Pulmonary Metabolic, Inflammatory and&#xD;
      Fibrogenic Activity in Patients With Silicosis Due to Artificial Stone and PMF.&#xD;
