    <textblock>
      Objective: &quot;Decentering&quot; is defined as the ability to observe one's thoughts and feelings as&#xD;
      temporary, objective events in the mind, and is increasingly regarded as a candidate&#xD;
      mechanism in mindfulness-based interventions. The current study sought to examine the role of&#xD;
      decentering, and other related variables, in the efficacy of Mindfulness-based cognitive&#xD;
      therapy (MBCT) as compared to two active comparison conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: Formerly depressed individuals (N = 227), randomly assigned to MBCT (n = 74),&#xD;
      relaxation group therapy (RGT; n = 77) or treatment-as-usual (TAU; n = 76), completed&#xD;
      self-report measures of decentering and symptoms of depression at pre-, mid-, and&#xD;
      post-treatment, and relapse was assessed at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, post-treatment.&#xD;

    <description>Remitted depressed participants received eight-weekly, two-hour MBCT sessions (Segal et al., 2013). This program combines MBSR meditation practices (e.g., body scan, mindful stretching, mindfulness of breath/body/sounds/thoughts) with traditional CT techniques (e.g., psychoeducation about depression symptoms and automatic thoughts, exercises designed to demonstrate how the nature of one's thoughts change with one's mood, questioning of automatic thoughts and creating a relapse prevention plan). Finally, participants engaged in a daily meditation practice and homework exercises directed at integrating the application of awareness skills into daily life. Each MBCT group was led by a masters-level clinician who was an active MBCT/Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) instructor.</description>

    <description>The revised edition of the Changeways Relaxation Programme (Paterson, 1997) served as the active control condition to control for non-specific group factors including group participation, expectation of change or therapeutic contact and attention. The rationale was that relaxation can be used to better manage life stressors which precipitate depressive episodes. Participants received eight-weekly, two-hour relaxation training sessions. This group program combines psychoeducation regarding the effects of stress, diaphragmatic breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, passive relaxation and imagery. It also incorporates time for participants to discuss the events of the week to facilitate the supportive aspect of group participation. Finally, participants were asked to engage in daily exercises to practice the various relaxation strategies. Each RGT group was led by a doctoral-level therapist.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to the TAU group were instructed that participants would receive MBCT at the end of the follow-up period and to seek help from their family doctors or other sources as the normally would, should the participants encounter symptomatic deterioration or other difficulties over the course of the study. At the end of the follow-up phase, participants in the TAU and RGT group were offered the opportunity to receive MBCT.</description>
