  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The electroencephalogram or EEG is a painless and non-invasive exploratory examination&#xD;
      routinely performed in clinical and experimental medicine and has various applications. It is&#xD;
      therefore relevant to develop application-specific EEG measurement devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical development of therapies based on brain control has led to the emergence of&#xD;
      numerous EEG devices that aim to allow mobile, autonomous, and easy use for users.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from the literature have proven the ability of neurofeedback (a form of biofeedback in&#xD;
      which subjects respond to a display of their own brainwaves in order to improve their health&#xD;
      or performance) to improve brain function in healthy or pathological subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These therapeutic applications are offered in hospital settings with conventional systems and&#xD;
      in the presence of a therapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EEG measurement device URGOnight was developed with the aim of offering autonomous&#xD;
      neurofeedback exercises at home. URGOnight is a portable device. It uses passive electrodes&#xD;
      (which do not send an electric current) and so-called dry electrodes, i.e. no gel or&#xD;
      conductive paste is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the SIGMA study aims to evaluate the quality of the EEG signal collected by&#xD;
      URGOnight and compare it with an electroencephalography device commonly used in clinical and&#xD;
      research settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also evaluate the quality of the brain wave measurement usually retained in&#xD;
      comparative studies of EEG systems.&#xD;
