      this project seeks to understand and quantify the effects of powered transtibial prostheses&#xD;
      on socket loading and direct measures of residual limb health so as to inform the&#xD;
      optimization of prosthesis fit.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Some estimates suggest that by 2050, as many as 3.6 million people in the United States will&#xD;
      be living with limb loss, and at least 60% of them will have had at least a foot removed For&#xD;
      military personnel, combat-related amputations remain one of the most common major disabling&#xD;
      war-related injuries from modern armed conflict. Technological advancements in active&#xD;
      prosthetic devices for individuals with transtibial amputation offer the potential for&#xD;
      superior function in key areas that could lead to higher rates of RTD and improved quality of&#xD;
      life. Currently intended primarily for individuals with a K-level of 3 or 4, active&#xD;
      transtibial prostheses that provide controlled plantar/dorsiflexion in either swing&#xD;
      (microprocessor-controlled prostheses) or late stance (prostheses with powered propulsion)&#xD;
      are likely to become the gold standard in the future as technology continues to improve&#xD;
      Indeed, users of these types of prostheses have higher mobility than those using any of the&#xD;
      other four categories of prosthetic ankle-foot mechanisms for unlimited community ambulators.&#xD;
      Note that a major insurer has recently declared microprocessor-controlled ankle-foot&#xD;
      prostheses medically necessary for members whose functional level is 3 or above.The PROPRIO&#xD;
      FOOT® by Ossur, is a microprocessor-controlled prosthesis that regulates the angle of ankle&#xD;
      dorsiflexion during the swing phase. This added ankle control of these devices reduces the&#xD;
      risk of falls by increasing toe clearance supports more natural standing posture on slopes&#xD;
      and improves stair and slope ascent/descent capability by adapting to the change in&#xD;
      terrain.On stairs, the PROPRIO FOOT® has been shown to improve affected leg knee kinematics&#xD;
      (increased knee flexion) and kinetics (increased knee moment) instance. These improvements&#xD;
      also contributed to higher interlimb symmetry reduced energetic cost of slope ascent and&#xD;
      higher Amputee Mobility Predictor with a Prosthesis (AMPPRO) scores . Although the ankle of&#xD;
      the PROPRIO FOOT® can be controlled in swing, the device does not have adequate power to&#xD;
      provide an active propulsion instance. The Empower ankle by Ottobock is a powered prosthesis&#xD;
      that provides active propulsion in late stance to mimic the positive work performed by the&#xD;
      ankle plantar flexors in push-off. The Empower has been shown to improve affected leg&#xD;
      kinematics (increased ankle range of motion and reduced knee flexion) on smooth flat ground&#xD;
      ramp ascent and gravel]. In terms of kinetics, the Empower likewise results in increased&#xD;
      ankle power on level ground stairs and ramps . Active prostheses like the PROPRIO FOOT® and&#xD;
      Empower ankle offer great potential to more completely restore the locomotor capabilities of&#xD;
      individuals with transtibial amputation, perhaps enhancing RTD for military personnel. As&#xD;
      with all prosthetic components, though, these active devices are of little use if they induce&#xD;
      pain and/or injury at the residual limb to the degree that the user will simply not wear&#xD;
      them. The investigators will examine how optimal fit of lower limb prostheses can impact&#xD;
      individuals comfort and/or reduce irritation.&#xD;

The investigators will examine factors of socket loading and direct measures of residual limb health so as to inform the optimization of prosthesis fit. The testing will consist of walking on a treadmill and the use of a 3D motion capture camera to track movement and angles of the participant's upper and lower extremities. Ascending and descending on stairs and ramps with the device will be completed. Participants will also have laser speckle imaging to measure blood flow to skin and transepidermal water loss measurement to check skin health.</description>
