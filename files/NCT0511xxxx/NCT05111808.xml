  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized prospective, open label, single site study to evaluate the&#xD;
      feasibility of recruitment for the use of an Investigational Endoscopic Fluorescence Imaging&#xD;
      System, PINPOINT, in intraoperative bilateral visualization of ureters using intravenous&#xD;
      injection of methylene blue. Feasibility of urine sample collection during surgery will also&#xD;
      be assessed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background - During certain abdominal surgeries there is difficulty in finding the ureters,&#xD;
      which act as a conduit for urine from the kidneys to the bladder. If they are sectioned&#xD;
      during surgery this causes great suffering for the patient and increased costs for the&#xD;
      hospital and the NHS. Even experienced surgeons are at risk of causing this dreaded&#xD;
      complication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methylene blue can emit a fluorescent signal and highlight the ureters in real time during&#xD;
      surgical procedures. A study is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of methylene blue&#xD;
      fluorescence to identify the ureters during surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods - In this study, patients undergoing abdominal surgery with high risk for ureter&#xD;
      complications will be included. The feasibility of recruitment of these patients will be&#xD;
      assessed using a screening log. Included patients with receive intraoperative methylene blue&#xD;
      injection in increasing doses. Urine samples will be taken to establish the conversion of&#xD;
      methylene blue to leucomethylene blue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results - we expect to define the recruitment rate of the patient group of interest&#xD;
      and to identify the causes for non recruitment. Secondary outcomes are ureteric&#xD;
      identification and conversion of methylene blue to leucomethylene blue.&#xD;

    <measure>Rate of ureteric identification and signal intensity at defined time points</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The operation will be paused and image switched to the Pinpoint camera at 5, 10, 15, 20, 30 and 40 minutes. The signal to background ratio will be calculated from the near infra-red images. This will allow us to quantify the fluorescence of methylene blue under near infra-red light.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage conversion of methylene blue to leucomethylene blue at defined time points</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Urine samples will be taken at 10 minute intervals after the administration of methyl blue. The ratio of methylene blue to leucomethylene blue will be calculated at each of these stages to determine the likely rate of conversion rate.</description>
