      Background: The operating room (OR) environment presents specific conditions that put stress&#xD;
      on work dynamics. Disruptive behavior (DB) among members of the health team is recognized to&#xD;
      affect work dynamics and patient outcomes. The objective was to explore the perceptions of&#xD;
      different members of the health team, including surgeons, about the occurrence of DB and the&#xD;
      work dynamics in the OR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Qualitative exploratory study, based on semi structured individual interviews.&#xD;
      Twenty participants were sampled until data saturation, including surgeons, anesthetists,&#xD;
      nurses among other. Data extraction from verbatim transcriptions was performed by&#xD;
      investigators via qualitative analysis software, using grounded theory framework.&#xD;

      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      A qualitative exploratory study was carried out within an analytical and relational framework&#xD;
      of the contents [19,20]. The study was approved by a Scientific Ethics Committee (project ID:&#xD;
      15-340) and meets the quality standards for reporting qualitative Research (COREQ checklist).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection of participants Intentional theoretical sampling was performed, which considered&#xD;
      the representation of different members of the health team to seek maximum heterogeneity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criterion was that the health members had at least one year of experience in&#xD;
      the operating room. Participants were included until achieving data saturation from the&#xD;
      information obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection In-depth individual interviews were based on a semistructured script designed&#xD;
      to investigate the perceptions of the participants about the activity they performed, the&#xD;
      ideal working conditions, the presence of disruptive behaviors, and their management. The&#xD;
      final version of the script was reached after the first four interviews. Once the adjustments&#xD;
      were made, the same script was used with the other participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interviews were conducted by two interviewers (DZ and MC) with experience in this&#xD;
      collection technique and who were not linked to the activities of the health team that was&#xD;
      the subject of this study. The information was collected in 2017 and 2018. The participants&#xD;
      were invited by email, and once they signed an informed consent, which explained the&#xD;
      research´s goal and information about their participation. Once they agreed to participate,&#xD;
      the interviewers interviewed an office face-to-face to guarantee privacy and confidentiality.&#xD;
      Interviews lasted an average of 45 minutes, and all were audio-recorded and later transcribed&#xD;
      verbatim.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis The participants' responses were analyzed with open and axial coding, based on&#xD;
      the grounded theory model to relate the categories emerging from the responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grounded theory is based on the analysis of the narrative contained in the interviews. This&#xD;
      in turn leads to the development of codes, categories and themes based on the descriptions to&#xD;
      culminate in hypotheses of how these themes interact. Atlas.ti v8.0 software was used for the&#xD;
      data analysis (ATLAS.ti Scientific Software Development GmbH, Lietzenburger Str. 75, D-10719&#xD;
      Berlin, Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six researchers from the team collaborated in the analysis of the transcripts through an&#xD;
      iterative process of intersubjective data triangulation sessions until definitive categories&#xD;
      and guiding questions were reached regarding the phenomenon under study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the analysis, all participants received an email, who explained the findings and asked&#xD;
      for feedback (member checking).&#xD;
