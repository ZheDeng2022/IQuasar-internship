    <textblock>
      This initial study is a pilot feasibility study with a primary objective of assessing the&#xD;
      feasibility of a larger study by evaluating the procedures and methodology, as well as&#xD;
      collecting pilot data. The eventual research goal is to demonstrate whether a suicide&#xD;
      prevention video in addition to standard care for suicidality is an effective strategy to&#xD;
      reduce suicidal behaviours in individuals with a history of such. The suicide prevention&#xD;
      video is developed as an educational tool to inform participants of the various consequences&#xD;
      of suicide as well as giving a message of hope. It is hoped that such an approach will help&#xD;
      to reduce future suicidal behaviours in those who have a history of such. If so, then this&#xD;
      could be made as a part of the standard of care in treating patients with suicidality.&#xD;

      This pilot study will assess the study procedures and methodology to determine the&#xD;
      feasibility of a larger study that will be done to asses for any difference in suicidal&#xD;
      behaviours when the suicide prevention video is used in addition to standard of care. As&#xD;
      such, the primary objectives will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Testing of recruitment, retention, consent, and assignment procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Validating the inclusion/exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determining the acceptability and safety of the proposed intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluating implementation procedures and methodology for the intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluating the appropriateness of timing and frequency of data collection points&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluating the appropriateness and feasibility of the assessment tools&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obtaining parameters for sample size estimation for the larger study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessing the effectiveness of the video medium, content in the video and length of the&#xD;
           video&#xD;

    <measure>Mean change from baseline in the expression of suicidal ideation on the Modified Scale for Suicidal Ideation at 48 hours, 3 months and 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>To measure the change in suicidal behaviours after viewing the video using the &quot;The Modified Scale for Suicidal Ideation&quot;. The scale is used to assess the presence or absence of suicide ideation and the degree of severity of suicidal ideas. The benefit of this scale is that it was developed so that paraprofessionals could administer the scale, yet demonstrated excellent internal consistency and interrater reliability, correlated highly with clinician's ratings of suicidal ideation and risk, and discriminated between suicide attempters and nonattempters prior to hospitalization. The scale would be administered at baseline, after watching the video and at 3 and 6 months after watching the video. Each question is scored for a total score that is interpreted as degree of suicidal ideation. Total score range is 0 to 54. Higher scores indicate more severe suicidal ideations. Changes in the total scores will be analyzed.</description>
