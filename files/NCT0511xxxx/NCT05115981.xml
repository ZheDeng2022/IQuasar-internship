  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Drug addiction to psychoactive substances, widely consumed in France, represents a major&#xD;
      public health issue. The three main motivations identified for the consumption of&#xD;
      psychostimulants would be self-medication, the party aspect and the improvement of school&#xD;
      performance. Students of medicine and pharmacy are a population exposed to academic and&#xD;
      professional stress, vulnerable to health problems and psycho-social disorders (anxiety,&#xD;
      depression), with direct access to many drugs at their workplace. Almost a third of these&#xD;
      students declared to consume these products to improve their cognitive performance, while a&#xD;
      recent study showed that they take them instead to manage their stress and sleep. However, no&#xD;
      study has characterized all the different uses of psychoactive drugs (PAD) in this&#xD;
      population, nor the motivations for consumption, while an analysis of motives would help to&#xD;
      develop better screening and prevention strategies. The main objective of the research is to&#xD;
      characterize the motivations for PAD consumption among students of medicine and pharmacy in&#xD;
      France. The most represented motives will be analyzed on the questionnaire of motivations for&#xD;
      consumption (threshold frequency ≥20%). The secondary objectives are to identify the risk&#xD;
      factors linked to the individual, to the environment and to drugs in students with PAD use&#xD;
      disorders regardless of their motivation and in those using to improve their performance.&#xD;
