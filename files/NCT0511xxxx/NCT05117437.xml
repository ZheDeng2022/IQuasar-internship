  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 9 from the BMP family has an important role in the&#xD;
      remodeling of bone and cartilage. Due to these features, BMP9 can play an important role in&#xD;
      especially anaerobic exercise training adaptations. However, the role of anaerobic exercise&#xD;
      in these effects is still unclear. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of BMP9&#xD;
      on the effects of acute and chronic anaerobic exercise on bone metabolism markers.&#xD;
      Postprandial venous blood samples were taken pre- and post- acute YOYO intermittent recovery&#xD;
      test (level 1) in 40 trained male athletes aged 18-35 who did anaerobic sports (such as&#xD;
      basketball, volleyball and handball) and 41 sedentary volunteers aged 18-35. Serum BMP9, as&#xD;
      markers of bone formation and resorption; alkaline phosphatase (ALP), C-terminal telopeptide&#xD;
      of type 1 collagen (CTX1), cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) and calcium levels were&#xD;
      determined. The data to be obtained as a result of our study can give information about the&#xD;
      relationship between the skeletal and bone health of the athletes and anaerobic exercise.&#xD;

    <description>Postprandial venous blood samples were obtained before and after acute YOYO IR test (level 1). The YOYO test lasted 10-20 minutes depending on the ability level of the participants. A blood sample was taken 15 minutes before and 15 minutes after the YOYO test. From these blood samples, serum Bone morphogenetic protein 9 (BMP9) was determined.</description>
