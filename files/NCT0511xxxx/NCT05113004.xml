  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are no approved treatments for pSS and the clinical endpoints currently used in&#xD;
      clinical trials are inadequate to capture all aspects of the disease that should be evaluated&#xD;
      in clinical trials. The newly developed composite endpoint: Sjögren's Tool for Assessing&#xD;
      Response to treatment (STAR) will allow a more specific and meaningful assessment of&#xD;
      treatment efficacy in pSS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the heterogeneity of the disease and of the central role of the interplay between&#xD;
      B- and T-cells in the pathogenesis, it is worth to evaluate combination of conventional&#xD;
      synthetic immunomodulatory drugs targeting both B- and T-cells.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) is a systemic autoimmune disease with a female-to-male&#xD;
      predominance of 9:1 and a peak incidence at 50 years of age. It is characterized by chronic&#xD;
      inflammation and subsequent destruction of exocrine glands, mainly lacrimal and salivary&#xD;
      glands, with ocular and oral dryness. Patients also experience joint pain and extreme&#xD;
      fatigue. In 20-40% of patients, the inflammatory process extends beyond the exocrine glands&#xD;
      and patients experience systemic extra glandular manifestations, with 5-10% developing B-cell&#xD;
      lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two populations of pSS patients can be defined. Patients with dryness, fatigue, pain and low&#xD;
      systemic activity present no or limited long-term extraglandular damage but they have a&#xD;
      profoundly reduced quality of life with marked anxiety, depression, and social isolation&#xD;
      (Rischmueller 2016)(Meijer, 2009). Patients with high systemic activity have important&#xD;
      long-term damage and bad prognosis. To date, there are no approved disease-modifying&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current clinical outcome assessment (COA) tools in pSS have shown important weaknesses (e.g.&#xD;
      high placebo response rate) which may hamper demonstration of therapeutic benefit. A novel&#xD;
      COA called STAR has recently been developed by the NECESSITY consortium (funded by the&#xD;
      Innovative Medicines Initiative) and should allow the identification of new therapeutic&#xD;
      options for both patient populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to demonstrate, thanks to the new STAR outcome measure, efficacy of a combination&#xD;
      therapy targeting both B- and T-cells in pSS patients.&#xD;

    <description>Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is a 4-aminoquinoline belonging to the group of antimalarial agents. Its immunomodulatory activity on B-cells has mainly been attributed to its inhibition of antigen presentation, cytokine production, and recently on Toll-like receptor signaling and IFN secretion that drives B cell activation.</description>
