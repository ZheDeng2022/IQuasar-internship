  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to compare pembrolizumab plus paclitaxel with or without bevacizumab&#xD;
      to placebo plus paclitaxel with or without bevacizumab, with respect to progression-free&#xD;
      survival (PFS) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 as assessed by&#xD;
      the investigator. The hypotheses are that pembrolizumab plus paclitaxel with or without&#xD;
      bevacizumab is superior to placebo plus paclitaxel with or without bevacizumab, with respect&#xD;
      to PFS per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by the investigator for participants with programmed cell&#xD;
      death ligand 1 (PD-L1) positive tumors (Combined Positive Score [CPS] ≥1) and that&#xD;
      pembrolizumab plus paclitaxel with or without bevacizumab is superior to placebo plus&#xD;
      paclitaxel with or without bevacizumab, with respect to PFS per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by the&#xD;
      investigator for all participants.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Up to ~42 months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) per RECIST 1.1 based on Investigator assessment or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Per RECIST 1.1, PD is defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. Note: The appearance of one or more lesions and the unequivocal progression of non-target lesions is also considered PD. The PFS per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by the Investigator will be presented.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Global Health Status/Quality of Life (GHS/Qol) Score (Items 29 and 30) Using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to ~68 months</time_frame>
    <description>The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a questionnaire to assess the overall quality of life of cancer patients. Participant responses to the questions &quot;How would you rate your overall health during the past week?&quot; and &quot;How would you rate your overall quality of life during the past week?&quot; are scored on a 7-point scale (1= Very poor to 7=Excellent). Using linear transformation, raw scores are standardized, so that scores range from 0 to 100. A higher score indicates a better overall health status. The change from baseline in EORTC QLQ-C30 Items 29 and 30 combined score will be presented.</description>

    <measure>Time to Deterioration (TTD) in the GHS/Qol Score (Items 29 and 30) Using the EORTC QLQ-C30</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to ~68 months</time_frame>
    <description>TTD is defined as the time from Baseline to the first onset of a ≥10-point negative change (decrease) from Baseline in GHS (EORTC QLQ-C30 Items 29 and 30) score. Using linear transformation, raw scores are standardized, so that scores range from 0 to 100. The TTD, as assessed based on a ≥10-point negative change (decrease) from Baseline in GHS score, will be presented. A longer TTD indicates a better outcome.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and up to ~68 months</time_frame>
    <description>The EORTC QLQ-OV28 is an abdominal and gastrointestinal questionnaire (items 31-36). Participant responses to the question &quot;Did you have abdominal pain ?&quot; are scored on a 4-point scale (1=Not at All to 4=Very Much). Using linear transformation, raw scores are standardized, so that scores range from 0 to 100. The change from baseline in abdominal and gastrointestinal symptoms (EORTC QLQ-LC28 Items 31-36) score will be presented. A lower score indicates a better outcome.</description>
