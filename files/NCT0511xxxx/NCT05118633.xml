  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trichotillomania is characterized by recurrent hair pulling resulting in hair loss causing&#xD;
      significant distress and impairment which persists despite repeated attempts to stop.&#xD;
      Behavioral based therapies focused on increasing awareness of hair pulling followed by the&#xD;
      use of an incompatible behavior have proven effective. In an effort to enhance awareness, a&#xD;
      wrist worn motion detection device and a companion mobile application was created. In this&#xD;
      study, we will test the initial efficacy of the HabitAware device and accompanying app as a&#xD;
      system for delivering self-administered habit reversal training (HRT).&#xD;
