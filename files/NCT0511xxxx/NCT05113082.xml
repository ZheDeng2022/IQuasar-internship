  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of this study is to capture management and treatment outcome data in&#xD;
      participants with short bowel syndrome and chronic intestinal failure (SBS-IF) that underwent&#xD;
      intestinal transplantation in Brazil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is about collecting data available in the participant's medical record and will&#xD;
      also describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of these participants. No&#xD;
      medication will be provided to participants in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data will be collected from a period up to 10 years before the day of the intestinal&#xD;
      transplantation. No clinic visits will be required as part of participation in this study.&#xD;
