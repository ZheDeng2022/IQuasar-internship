  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research will test the efficacy of group conversation treatment for people with&#xD;
      aphasia and explore whether the effects of treatment differ as a result of the following&#xD;
      factors:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Group size: Do large groups of 6-8 people with aphasia or dyads of 2 people with aphasia&#xD;
           demonstrate different levels of improvement with this treatment?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Group composition: Do effects of conversation group treatment differ if the groups&#xD;
           include members with similar or different types of aphasia?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Aphasia severity: Do effects of conversation group treatment differ if the individuals&#xD;
           within the group have mild-moderate or moderate-severe profiles of aphasia?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment sessions will occur in groups of 6-8 people with aphasia or with 2 people with&#xD;
      aphasia. During treatment sessions, discourse will be facilitated on a focused set of every&#xD;
      day topics, such as current events or travel. Linguistic and multi modal cueing hierarchies&#xD;
      will be tailored to individual client goals and used to maximize communication success.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prediction is that conversation treatment is an effective method for improving&#xD;
      communication in people with aphasia, but that specific benefits may differ based on&#xD;
      variables such as group size, group composition, and aphasia severity. The results will help&#xD;
      inform best practices for aphasia treatment and refine a hypothesized model about the&#xD;
      mechanisms underlying conversation treatment.&#xD;

    <description>The Aphasia Communication Outcome Measure (ACOM; Hula et al, 2015) is a patient reported outcome measure that reflects the clinical endpoint of conversation treatment. The ACOM is a psychometrically validated measure of the impact of aphasia on communication in daily life. The ACOM asks questions such as how effectively the person with aphasia talks to family members or clerks in a store. Standardized scores (T-scores) are computed, with higher values indicating better self-reported communication ability.</description>

    <description>The Comprehensive Aphasia Test (CAT; Swinburn, Howard, &amp; Porter, 2004) is a standardized test battery that targets expressive and receptive language in the oral and written modalities. Six sections of the language battery will be administered: comprehension of spoken language, comprehension of written language, repetition, naming, oral reading, and spoken picture description. Standardized scores (T-scores) are computed, with higher values reflecting better outcomes.</description>

    <description>Conversation treatment is a theoretically motivated approach in which a speech language pathologist facilitates discourse about topics of interest to the client using individualized, multi-modal supports. Treatment occurs either in groups of 6-8 people with aphasia or 2 people with aphasia. Individual communication goals are targeted for each group member within the context of naturalistic conversations.</description>
