  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At present, it is recommended to continue immunotherapy until progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, only a minority of patients benefits from a durable response and most see the&#xD;
      disease progress despite several months of control under immunotherapy. Multimodal approaches&#xD;
      have been developed to improve their prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study, randomized, open-label study aims to evaluate the impact of addition of ablative&#xD;
      radiotherapy on OS of patients with NSCLC and oligometastatic lesions and treated by&#xD;
      immunotherapy in first line (potentially associated with chemotherapy) or beyond.&#xD;
      Stereotactic radiotherapy will be performed on a maximum of 5 residual hypermetabolic lesions&#xD;
      seen on 18F-FDG PET / CT, in patients responding to immunotherapy (or with a stable disease)&#xD;
      for at least 6 months.&#xD;

      Description of the modalities for recruiting :&#xD;
&#xD;
      During a standard consultation, the oncologist presents the study to the patient with locally&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer long-term responders to immunotherapy. He&#xD;
      gives the patient the consent form to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the consent form has been signed by the patient and the investigator, the investigator&#xD;
      prescribes a screening test which must be carried out within 30 days before the randomization&#xD;
      (Day 0, D0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The screening step includes in particular a complete physical exam, a clinical laboratory&#xD;
      tests a thoraco abdomino pelvic (TAP) and cerebral CT scan, a cerebral MRI (for patients with&#xD;
      cerebral lesions observed on cerebral CT scan), a Spinal MRI (for patients with bones lesions&#xD;
      observed on TAP CT scan), a PET scan (18F-FDG) (the results will be routinely interpreted in&#xD;
      the centre and will be centrally reviewed), Patient Reported Outcome (PRO), QLQ-C30 and QLQ&#xD;
      LC13&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion of a patient is conditioned by the following definitive criterion : Maximum 5&#xD;
      residual hypermetabolic lesions measured on the CT from the 18F-FDG PET / CT centrally&#xD;
      reviewed, including primary tumor and a maximum of 3 brain asymptomatic metastases (even if&#xD;
      they are poorly seen in 18F- FDG PET/CT) treatable in stereotactic radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients registration and randomization :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any patient who has signed an informed consent form (ICF) must be registered in the eCRF in&#xD;
      order to be assigned a patient number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be centralized and performed via the eCRF. Patients will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned (1:1) to either continuation of immunotherapy alone or addition of local ablative&#xD;
      radiotherapy to immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomization procedure using minimization method will be stratified by the investigation&#xD;
      center, by the treatment line (1 vs â‰¥2) and by the immunotherapy (pembrolizumab and nivolumab&#xD;
      versus atezolizumab).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment period :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both arms continue the anti-PD1 or anti-PDL-1 immunotherapy according to the medical&#xD;
      prescription.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A (experimental), SRT start maximum 3 weeks after randomisation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visits include in particular a complete physical exam, a clinical laboratory tests,&#xD;
      a thoraco abdomino pelvic and cerebral CT scan, a cerebral MRI (for patients with cerebral&#xD;
      lesions observed on cerebral CT scan), a Spinal MRI (for patients with bones lesions observed&#xD;
      on TAP CT scan), a PET scan (18F-FDG) at 6 months post-randomization only (the results will&#xD;
      be routinely interpreted in the centre and will be centrally reviewed) ; Patient Reported&#xD;
      Outcome (PRO), QLQ-C30 and QLQ LC13&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging surveillance (CT scan +/- cerebral MRI +/- spinal MRI) will be performed for each&#xD;
      patient up to progression or up to 12 months after randomization of the last patient included&#xD;
      in the absence of progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vital status is collected once a year and also date of death if applicable for each patient&#xD;
      up to 12 months after randomization of the last patient included.&#xD;
