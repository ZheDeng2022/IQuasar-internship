    <textblock>
      To evaluate whether stringent follow-up consisting of combined laboratory and ultrasound&#xD;
      surveillance is superior to clinical monitoring alone to maintain clinical remission in&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis.&#xD;

      Randomized, controlled, parallel-group, multi-centre study in which patients with rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis treated with biological/targeted synthetic disease modifying antirheumatic drug&#xD;
      (b/tsDMARD) in mono- or combination therapy with conventional synthetic disease modifying&#xD;
      antirheumatic drug (csDMARD) in a stable dosage and interval for ≥6 months with low disease&#xD;
      activity or remission will receive an power Doppler musculoskeletal ultrasound examination&#xD;
      (PDUS) and monitoring of C-reactive protein (CRP) levels at baseline and several timepoints&#xD;
      within a 24 month study period (primary endpoint) and within a 48 month long-term extension.&#xD;
      At baseline, b/tsDMARD medication will be withdrawn in all patients, who will be randomized&#xD;
      in a 1:1 ratio in an &quot;Assisted monitoring&quot; (arm A) or a &quot;Clinical monitoring&quot; (arm B) arm&#xD;
      respectively. Further stratification for remission vs. low disease activity and mono- vs&#xD;
      combination therapy will be implemented in the randomisation process. In arm A, CRP and PDUS&#xD;
      information will be made available to the clinical assessors who, at each time-point will use&#xD;
      this information along with that from clinical examination, to identify patients experiencing&#xD;
      recurrence of inflammation which will then be counted as subclinical flare according to&#xD;
      predefined criteria. In arm B the results of CRP and PDUS will be recorded but will not be&#xD;
      made available to the clinical assessor who will have to identify clinical flares according&#xD;
      to predefined criteria based on information from the clinical examination only.&#xD;
