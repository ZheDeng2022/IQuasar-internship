  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) has granted approval for Rahika® (Capmatinib)&#xD;
      film-coated tablet 150 and 200 mg for the treatment of adult patients with&#xD;
      advanced/metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have a mutation that leads to MET exon 14 skipping&#xD;
      mutation with condition to perform a Phase IV clinical trial in Indian patients. As&#xD;
      recommended by DCGI, this Phase IV study has been planned to evaluate the safety and efficacy&#xD;
      of capmatinib in treatment of adult Indian patients with advanced/metastatic NSCLC whose&#xD;
      tumors have a MET exon 14 skipping mutation positive advanced NSCLC in any line of therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IV, prospective, multicenter, open-label, interventional study. The study&#xD;
      will include approximately 50 patients. The study will include molecular prescreening (28&#xD;
      days for patients who do not have documented MET exon 14 skipping mutation positive results),&#xD;
      screening period (28 days), treatment period of 24 weeks, end of treatment (EOT) visit, and&#xD;
      follow-up period of 30 days post last dose of study treatment. During the treatment period,&#xD;
      study treatment will be administered as capmatinib 400 mg orally as twice daily (BID) on a&#xD;
      continuous dosing schedule for 24 weeks. The treatment with capmatinib will be started only&#xD;
      when the previous anti-cancer treatment was stopped within 4 weeks or ≥5 x half-life&#xD;
      (whichever is longer) in subject who were on prior line/s of treatment. The treatment period&#xD;
      begins on Day 1 of Cycle 1. Each treatment cycle will be of 21 days. Cycle 2 will start on&#xD;
      Day 22 of the study and will be considered as Cycle 2 Day 22 (C2D22) and so on if there is no&#xD;
      temporary discontinuation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may be discontinued from treatment earlier due to unacceptable toxicity, disease&#xD;
      progression, withdrawal of consent, or at the discretion of the investigator or the patient.&#xD;
      These patients will have end of study (EOS) assessment 30 days after the administration of&#xD;
      last dose of the study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every effort will be made by Novartis to continue provision of study treatment capmatinib via&#xD;
      post trial access (PTA) to the patients who are ongoing on treatment at the end of the&#xD;
      planned duration of study and deriving clinical benefit. Patients transitioning to PTA will&#xD;
      also have to compete the EOS Visit assessment after the last dose administration of&#xD;
      capmatinib for the current study.&#xD;

             significant abnormal physical findings that in the opinion of the investigator may&#xD;

&#xD;
         16. Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of&#xD;
             becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception&#xD;
             while taking study treatment and for 7 days after stopping study treatment. Highly&#xD;
             effective contraception methods include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of&#xD;
                  the patient. Note that periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar, ovulation,&#xD;
                  symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not considered highly&#xD;
                  effective and therefore not acceptable methods of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without&#xD;
                  hysterectomy), total hysterectomy, or bilateral tubal ligation at least six weeks&#xD;
                  before taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the&#xD;
                  reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow-up hormone level&#xD;
                  assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female patients on&#xD;
                  the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that&#xD;
                  patient&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Use of oral, (estrogen and progesterone), injected, or implanted hormonal methods&#xD;
                  of contraception or placement of an intrauterine device or intrauterine system,&#xD;
                  or other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure&#xD;
                  rate &lt;1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception.&#xD;
                  In case of use of oral contraception women should have been stable on the same&#xD;
                  pill for a minimum of 3 months before taking treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Sexually active males unwilling to use a condom during intercourse while taking study&#xD;
             treatment and for 7 days after stopping study treatment. A condom is required for all&#xD;
             sexually active male patients to prevent them from fathering a child AND to prevent&#xD;
             delivery of study treatment via seminal fluid to their partner. In addition, male&#xD;
             patients must not donate sperm for the time period specified above.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Any other condition that would, in the Investigator's judgment, contraindicate&#xD;
             patient's participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns or compliance&#xD;
             with clinical study procedures, e.g., active infection (including active hepatitis B&#xD;
             and C, SARS-CoV-2), inflammation, intestinal obstruction, unable to swallow&#xD;
             medication, social/ psychological issues, etc.&#xD;
