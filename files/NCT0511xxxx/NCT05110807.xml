  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TQB3617 is a bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) inhibitor that can competitively bind to&#xD;
      bromodomains (BRDs) with Acetylated lysine(Kac) and block or partially block the role of KAc&#xD;
      in subsequent gene transcription and regulation of chromatin structure, thereby playing an&#xD;
      anti-tumor role.&#xD;
