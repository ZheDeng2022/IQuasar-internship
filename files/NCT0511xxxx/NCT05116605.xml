  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this research study is to assess how the implementation of&#xD;
      photobiomodulation affects sleep quality, sleep structure, nocturnal physiology, subjective&#xD;
      wellness, recovery from stressors, and resultant effects on performance and well-being.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Photobiomodulation (PBM) is light therapy in both the visible and near-infrared range&#xD;
      (non-UV). This light is absorbed through the skin and functions at the cellular level,&#xD;
      providing a lowering of inflammation and oxidative stress. By provoking these photochemical&#xD;
      changes, previous research indicates that PBM can provide both physical (e.g. pain reduction,&#xD;
      strength enhancement) and cognitive benefits (e.g. increased memory extinction, improved&#xD;
      cortical oxygen consumption). PBM is effective both preceding and succeeding functional&#xD;
      tests, proving its ability to provide a preventative and rehabilitative impact on the&#xD;
      functionality of cells and tissues. Metabolic changes to the cerebral cortex and the muscular&#xD;
      system combine with anti-inflammatory and protective capabilities to augment recovery from&#xD;
      physiological stressors. A plurality of literature reports light therapy given solely to&#xD;
      specific body regions. However, partial body treatment may limit the comprehensive and&#xD;
      systematic response to PBM treatment. Consequently, recent developments from commercial&#xD;
      companies, such as NovoTHOR, have generated a consumer market for whole-body PBM. Yet, the&#xD;
      physiological responses to these treatment modalities, as well as their effects on health and&#xD;
      well-being is not fully understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo a four week block of baseline data collection, which involves&#xD;
      nightly sleep monitoring, as well as daily, weekly, and monthly surveys and assessments.&#xD;
      Following the baseline block, participants will complete a four week intervention block&#xD;
      completing 3 PBM sessions per week. PBM sessions will be completed using the NovoThor light&#xD;
      bed and will last 20 minutes in duration. Daily, weekly, and monthly monitoring and tasks&#xD;
      will continue throughout this block.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>All participants will complete the following design. Women who experience menstrual flow will be scheduled to ensure that flow occurs on weeks 4 &amp; 8 for consistency.&#xD;
Baseline block (weeks 1-4): At intake, participants will complete up to 13 surveys, which includes 2 baseline questionnaires, &amp; the first rendition of weekly &amp; monthly surveys, as well as complete a physical performance task &amp; 4 cognitive tasks. Participants will complete daily surveys each morning &amp; night, &amp; wear wearable devices to monitor physiology during sleep. A laboratory visit will occur once per week for completion of weekly surveys, as well as cognitive &amp; physical performance assessments; monthly surveys will also be completed during the fourth week.&#xD;
Intervention block (weeks 5-8): Daily, weekly, &amp; monthly activities described for the baseline block will continue; participants will additionally complete three 20-minute PBM sessions per week. The final week of this block will also involve an exit survey.</intervention_model_description>
