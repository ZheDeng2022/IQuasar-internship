    <textblock>
      The aim of this explorative pilot study is to present muscle perfusion of the lower extremity&#xD;
      in patients with PAD using the Multispectral Optoacoustic Tomography (MSOT) method to build a&#xD;
      3D reconstruction of the calf muscle. This study aims to show the feasibility of 3D&#xD;
      reconstruction of this non-invasive method. Advantages in diagnostics for patients with PAD&#xD;
      and three-dimensional tomography representation of the perfusion situation based on muscle&#xD;
      oxygenation will be evaluated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Functional imaging diagnostics is becoming increasingly important due to the steadily growing&#xD;
      knowledge of physiological processes in many diseases. Also in peripheral arterial occlusive&#xD;
      disease (PAD), new insights into the pathomechanism of the disease are continuously being&#xD;
      gained. This also increases the need for new non-invasive imaging methods that are able to&#xD;
      visualize the functional level of the disease progression and thus make it possible to&#xD;
      diagnose it at an early stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies indicate that it may be feasible to use multispectral optoacoustic tomography&#xD;
      (MSOT) to visualize hemodynamics as well as the fibrotic muscle remodeling process in PAD.&#xD;
      For a better understanding of the distribution pattern , the exploration of a 3D technique is&#xD;
      a next necessary step in imaging. This may show a possible existing heterogeneity of these&#xD;
      molecules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Holzwarth et al. were already able to gain knowledge about the 3D reconstruction from 2D&#xD;
      photoacoustic image slices using an optical pattern and the method's feasibility using&#xD;
      phantoms as well as in-vivo measurements of the forearm in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this exploratory pilot project is to bring these previous findings together and to&#xD;
      image muscle perfusion of the lower extremity in three dimensions using the MSOT method and&#xD;
      to verify its feasibility. The advantage of 3D imaging is, beyond the anatomical topography&#xD;
      of the muscle, to map a three-dimensional representation of the perfusion situation based on&#xD;
      muscle oxygenation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this purpose, six patients of different symptomatic PAD stages and a healthy control of&#xD;
      two volunteers will be included and examined by means of longitudinal MSOT scans in the area&#xD;
      of the gastrocnemius muscle. To evaluate the current stage of the disease or to exclude&#xD;
      relevant PAD in the healthy control population, non-invasive examination measures commonly&#xD;
      used in routine diagnostics of PAD will be applied. In addition to the relevant risk&#xD;
      factors/adjacent diseases and the current medication intake, these include the recording of&#xD;
      the ankle-brachial index (ABI), color-coded duplex sonographic vascular imaging (CCDS) and a&#xD;
      treadmill examination.&#xD;
