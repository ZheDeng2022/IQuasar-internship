  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will address key testing challenges in Utah schools by building on&#xD;
      collaborations with public school districts, private schools, charter schools and with Utah&#xD;
      Department of Health on coronavirus disease (COVID-19) testing and existing infrastructure.&#xD;
      The study team will work closely with schools and the Utah public health system to implement&#xD;
      and test a shovel-ready and scalable health information technology approach that delivers&#xD;
      automated text messages (TM) to students' parents and faculty/staff members around COVID-19&#xD;
      testing. In addition, some students and faculty/staff will receive a health navigator (HN)&#xD;
      follow-up to ensure that tests are completed. Families (both of students and faculty/staff&#xD;
      members) will be offered the recently FDA-approved in-home serial testing approach if&#xD;
      accessing in-person testing is a challenge. While this project is focused on COVID-19&#xD;
      testing, in the case that the COVID-19 vaccination becomes more relevant or is the priority&#xD;
      of the school, the study team is able to tailor the intervention to focus on the vaccine as&#xD;
      well.&#xD;

      Recruitment: The proposed study will partner with 30 or more elementary and middle schools&#xD;
      from Utah school districts, as well as private and charter schools in the surrounding area.&#xD;
      All students who attend partnering schools will be enrolled, with parents provided with a&#xD;
      study information sheet/cover letter with details about the study and information on how to&#xD;
      opt out. Staff at the participating schools/districts who wish to participate will also be&#xD;
      enrolled and receive the same information sheet/cover letter and opt-out information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Randomization of parent/student and staff participants will consist of two&#xD;
      phases, both taking placed upon enrollment in the study. Phase 1 will consist of assigning&#xD;
      participants to text messaging or to usual care groups. The Phase 2 randomization will take&#xD;
      place among participants in the TM condition. They will be assigned a Phase 2 condition of&#xD;
      continued TM or TM + health navigator (HN), which they will received during intervention&#xD;
      cycles in which they are evaluated as non-compliant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants included in Phase 1 are those who did not opt-out of the study. Participants&#xD;
      eligible for Phase 1 Randomization will either be assigned to 1) Usual Care (control,&#xD;
      approximately 20% of participants) or 2) Text Messages (TM, approximately 80% of&#xD;
      participants).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Usual Care- Participants will only receive public service announcement-type messaging on&#xD;
           COVID-19 testing every 3 weeks (e.g., recommendation to obtain COVID-19 testing if&#xD;
           exposed or experience symptoms; information on testing options through the school or&#xD;
           district).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TM consists of a text message prompt asking if a participant has COVID-19 symptoms or if&#xD;
           a participant has been exposed to a person that has tested positive for COVID-19. If a&#xD;
           participant responds yes, they will receive a TM prompt for immediate testing and to&#xD;
           re-test. Participants will be provided with information on testing options for COVID-19.&#xD;
           After 24 hours, the participant will be asked if they tested and what their results are.&#xD;
           After 3 days, participants will be prompted to re-test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      For participants in the TM condition, the Phase 2 condition will be randomly assigned upon&#xD;
      enrollment. Participants will receive their Phase 2 condition if they are non-compliant with&#xD;
      the TM intervention. Participants will be evaluated as non-compliant if they had reported&#xD;
      symptoms or contact and then stop responding to text messages or respond that they did not&#xD;
      test. Participants will be randomized to 1) TM or 2) TM plus health navigator (TM+HN).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TM will continue to consist of prompts and reminders on COVID-19 testing options.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TM+HN consists of continued text messages about COVID-19 testing options with the&#xD;
           addition of a brief telephone call from a health navigator (HN). These calls will be&#xD;
           conducted using Motivation and Problem Solving (MAPS). MAPS is an empirically validated&#xD;
           proactive coaching approach used to address barriers and motivate participants to&#xD;
           utilize testing options if they are experiencing COVID-19 symptoms or have been exposed&#xD;
           to someone that has tested positive for COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments: The study team will collect survey data from students, staff members and parents&#xD;
      at pre- and post-intervention as well as throughout the trial. COVID-19 test results of&#xD;
      participants will be collected through self-report as well as through results reported to the&#xD;
      &quot;Ellume&quot; testing app. Additionally, the study team will conduct stakeholder interviews with&#xD;
      students, parents, and staff on ways to improve the interventions to better meet their needs&#xD;
      and preferences.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>A Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) design will be employed using short time frames (&lt;1 month) and iterative evaluation cycles. The proposed trial will compare the efficacy of text messaging (TM) versus usual care in a first randomization of the study. Non-compliant participants (if no COVID-19 test is completed or no response received) will then receive their Phase 2 condition of continued TM or TM + Health Navigator (HN) to test whether &quot;stepping up&quot; to HN improves outcomes for those not responding to the first-line intervention of TM. All randomizations will take place on the individual level at the beginning of the study; participants will be randomized to the initial intervention (TM vs. usual care; Phase 1 Randomization), and TM participants will also be randomized to the Phase 2 condition (TM or TM+HN) which they would receive during cycles during which they are non-compliant.</intervention_model_description>
