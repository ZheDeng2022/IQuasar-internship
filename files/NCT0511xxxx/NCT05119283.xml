  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Periodontitis is a chronic and destructive inflammation that leads to the loss of tissue&#xD;
      supporting the teeth, the periodontium, and possibly tooth loss and edentulism. Its etiology&#xD;
      is related to an overload on the host's defense mechanisms, consequent to the accumulation of&#xD;
      plaque or suppression of the immune system. Standard treatment for periodontitis includes&#xD;
      scaling and root planing (RAR) and possible association with therapeutic adjuvants such as&#xD;
      systemic and local antimicrobials. However, the use of these drugs supporting the treatment&#xD;
      of periodontitis, has shown adverse effects such as loss of taste, soft tissue burn, pain,&#xD;
      xerostomia, supragingival calculus formation and change in staining of teeth, restorations,&#xD;
      prostheses and tongue. Other effects not as common as mucosal ulcerations, desquamative&#xD;
      lesions, urticaria, dyspnea, anaphylactic shock and swellings reversible effects in the&#xD;
      parotid glands and lips have also been observed and reported in the literature. Thus, there&#xD;
      is a need for new adjuvant therapies, which cause less effects side effects and that are more&#xD;
      effective in the treatment of periodontitis and in the maintenance of oral health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The commercial product PHTALOX® is a phthalocyanine dental mouthwash that has a spectrum of&#xD;
      action based on the formation of reactive oxygen that acts by inhibiting odor-causing&#xD;
      substances, on microorganisms and on the mechanisms of coagulation and healing. Your&#xD;
      supporting action in periodontal treatment may have promising potential. Thus, the purpose of&#xD;
      this study clinical trial will be testing a formulation containing PHTALOX® for disease&#xD;
      prevention and control Periodontal (PD). 30 patients will be recruited who will undergo&#xD;
      scaling and straightening coronaroradicular (RAR), and after basic periodontal treatment will&#xD;
      be randomly divided into 3 groups according to the supporting treatment: G1 - patients who&#xD;
      will receive mouthwashes with physiological solution; G2 - patients who will receive 0.12%&#xD;
      chlorhexidine mouthwash; G3 - patients who will be treated with PHTALOX®. Clinical&#xD;
      reassessments of patients will be carried out before the treatments, and at 15, 30 and 60&#xD;
      days after the performance of the RAR and beginning of the respective mouthwash. After data&#xD;
      collection, intra and intergroup analyzes will be performed comparing the therapeutic results&#xD;
      for the periodontal condition through the &quot;Bioestat&quot; program.&#xD;

      PATIENT SELECTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research project will be submitted to the Ethics Committee for Research with Human&#xD;
      Beings, at the Federal University of Alfenas (UNIFAL-MG), following the resolution of the&#xD;
      National Health Council 466/2012.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical planning was performed using the formula n = 1 + [2 * 10.51 * (0.2 / 0.172) ²],&#xD;
      obtaining a number of approximately 30 patients, with a study power of 90%. This study will&#xD;
      be clinical, double blind, involving patients aged between 18 and 50 years, who will be seen&#xD;
      at the Periodontics Clinic of the Faculty of Dentistry, UNIFAL-MG and diagnosed with&#xD;
      periodontitis. Secondary data will not be used for the study. After diagnosis, patients will&#xD;
      read and sign the Informed Consent Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will answer a questionnaire about their socioeconomic conditions, and soon after&#xD;
      undergoing the examination for bleeding, probing, clinical attachment level, probing depth&#xD;
      and plaque index for initial clinical evaluation. Basic periodontal treatment will be carried&#xD;
      out with the same operator (blind to the treatments performed), with complete removal of&#xD;
      plaque and calculi, prophylaxis with pumice and prophylactic paste and oral hygiene&#xD;
      instructions. After basic periodontal treatment, patients will be randomly divided based on a&#xD;
      draw with closed, opaque and non-translucent envelopes, into 3 groups according to the&#xD;
      supporting treatments: G1 - patients who will receive mouthwashes with saline solution; G2 -&#xD;
      patients who will be rinsed with 0.12% chlorhexidine and G3 - patients who will be treated&#xD;
      with PHTALOX®. Each group will consist of the same number of patients, that is, 10. Patients&#xD;
      will receive 140 mL of the substances, to be used for 7 days, twice a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical reassessments of patients will be made before the treatments, and at 15, 30 and 60&#xD;
      after the performance of the RAR and beginning of the respective mouthwashes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INSTRUCTIONS TO PATIENTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be instructed on how they will use therapeutic adjuvants, according to the&#xD;
      product to be used. In the act of orientation, the patient will use the adjunct for further&#xD;
      explanation and standardization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treated patients will be instructed to use the product twice a day for 7 days, one in the&#xD;
      morning and one in the evening, 30 minutes after brushing and flossing. The mouthwash should&#xD;
      be carried out for 30 seconds with 10 mL of the solution corresponding to the group. All&#xD;
      products must be completely expelled after rinsing. No product can be diluted in water and,&#xD;
      after its use, the patient cannot eat or drink any liquid for at least 30 minutes. The&#xD;
      patient will be advised that any signs of irritation, pain or other adverse effects that may&#xD;
      appear are reported to the research group for evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As for oral hygiene habits, the patient should brush their teeth at least 3 times a day and&#xD;
      floss at least once a day. The mean value of the frequency of oral hygiene habits will be&#xD;
      collected at the end of the treatment, as well as information regarding gender, age,&#xD;
      socioeconomic level, education level and number of teeth, for further analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, patients will be evaluated through the Community Periodontal Index, O' Leary&#xD;
      Index and Bleeding Index on Probing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      After collecting the primary data, intra and intergroup analyzes will be performed comparing&#xD;
      socioeconomic results, periodontal condition, and treatments in isolation and their&#xD;
      interrelationships through the &quot;Bioestat&quot; program.&#xD;
