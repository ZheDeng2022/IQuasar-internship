  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aphasia is an impairment in the expression or comprehension of language that results from&#xD;
      stroke, traumatic brain injury or progressive neurological disease. Approximately two million&#xD;
      people in the United States suffer from aphasia, which has profound impacts on quality of&#xD;
      life, the ability to return to work and participation in life activities. Research has shown&#xD;
      that speech-language therapy, the treatment for aphasia, can significantly improve people's&#xD;
      ability to communicate. However, a major limitation in the field of aphasia rehabilitation is&#xD;
      the lack of predictability in patients' response to therapy and the inability to tailor&#xD;
      treatment to individuals. Currently, aphasia treatments are selected largely based on&#xD;
      patient's language abilities and language deficits with little consideration of learning&#xD;
      ability, which this study refers to as learning phenotype. Learning phenotype has been used&#xD;
      to inform rehabilitation approaches in other domains but is not currently considered in&#xD;
      aphasia. The overarching hypothesis of this work is that poor alignment of learning ability&#xD;
      and language therapy limits progress for patients and presents a barrier to individualizing&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of the proposed study are to (1) determine the learning phenotype of&#xD;
      individuals with aphasia, and (2) examine how lesion characteristics (size and location of&#xD;
      damage to the brain), language ability and cognitive ability relate to learning ability. To&#xD;
      accomplish objectives, investigators propose to measure implicit (observational) and explicit&#xD;
      (rule-based) learning ability in people with aphasia via computer-based tasks. Regression&#xD;
      models will be used to examine brain and behavioral factors that relate to learning ability.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aphasia is an impairment in the expression or comprehension of language that can limit&#xD;
      people's ability to communicate needs, reduce comprehension in complex environments, and&#xD;
      prevent a return to work or limit participation in everyday life activities. An approximate&#xD;
      795,000 individuals suffer from strokes each year, with 25% to 40% resulting in aphasia. The&#xD;
      process of aphasia rehabilitation engages many mechanisms of learning as patients are guided&#xD;
      to relearn, reaccess or regain functional use of language via therapies that involve stimuli,&#xD;
      tasks, cues, and feedback. Currently however, clinicians base decisions about the tasks and&#xD;
      targets of treatment methods on language deficits, and the strength and weakness of learning&#xD;
      systems is rarely, if ever, considered. The understanding of learning in aphasia and the way&#xD;
      that learning influences treatment outcomes is incomplete and presents a barrier in the&#xD;
      ability for clinicians to individually tailor treatment and reliably predict outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An in-depth characterization of learning in aphasia is important, as research has suggested&#xD;
      that multiple learning systems exist. Furthermore, manipulations to stimuli, task, and&#xD;
      feedback can lead to differential recruitment of learning systems and unlock learning&#xD;
      potential, particularly in clinical populations. Prior work in aphasia supports the&#xD;
      hypothesis that individuals with aphasia suffer from impaired learning mechanisms and are&#xD;
      sensitive to task manipulations. Such findings demonstrate that that people with aphasia&#xD;
      (PWA) are successful learning in some conditions and not others and provides the rationale&#xD;
      for the proposed series of studies focused on characterizing learning abilities in&#xD;
      individuals with aphasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current project proposes to use a single-subject experimental design to determine the&#xD;
      behavioral learning phenotype of individuals with aphasia subsequent to stroke. Implicit&#xD;
      (observational) and explicit (rule-based) learning is quantified in individuals with aphasia&#xD;
      using short computer-based experimental tasks. Investigators additionally explore whether&#xD;
      effect size of learning under observational and rule-based conditions is predicted by lesion&#xD;
      characteristics (size and extent of brain damage in regions of interest), cognitive abilities&#xD;
      (such as attention, working memory, executive function) and language severity. Findings will&#xD;
      help establish the behavioral and biological validity of learning phenotypes in aphasia and&#xD;
      will provide essential information needed to support future treatment studies that align&#xD;
      learning ability and language therapy to promote enhanced outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall Study Design The study will be conducted at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH)&#xD;
      MGH-Institute of Health Professions. Structural scans will be obtained at the MGH Athinoula&#xD;
      A. Martinos Biomedical Imaging Center. Participants with aphasia subsequent to stroke, in the&#xD;
      chronic stages of their aphasia (at least 6 months post-stroke) will be recruited to&#xD;
      participate. All participants will complete standardized assessments of cognitive and&#xD;
      language abilities and will complete computer-based tasks evaluating observational and&#xD;
      rule-based learning ability. Structural scans will be obtained to quantify the presence brain&#xD;
      damage in parts of the brain that are thought to relate to learning. A key novelty of the&#xD;
      approach is to introduce an evaluation of learning ability into diagnostic models of aphasia,&#xD;
      incorporating subject-specific behavioral and neural metrics.&#xD;

    <description>All participants will complete a computer-based serial response time task intended to measure observational (implicit) learning ability. In this task, participants look at a dot move from one of 4 positions on a computer screen. Unbeknownst to participants, dot movement followed a 12-movement pattern for most experimental blocks. Eye-tracking data is collected and eye fixations within regions of interest trigger trial advancement. Learning ability is evaluated as a comparison of saccadic response times during sequenced trials relative to pseudorandomized trials.</description>

    <description>All participants will complete a computer-based rule-based learning task intended to measure rule-based (explicit) learning ability. In this task, participants look at sequences of geometric shapes on a computer screen. Through visuals and verbal instruction, they are taught 5 rules that govern sequences. After learning rules, participants are asked to judge via button press whether novel sequences adhere to rules or not.</description>
