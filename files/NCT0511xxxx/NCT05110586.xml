  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurological disease with local inflammation, gliosis&#xD;
      and demyelination in the central nervous system (CNS). It is characterized by demyelinating&#xD;
      plaques in the brain and spinal cord. Many different symptoms can be seen in the CNS,&#xD;
      depending on the affected areas. One of the most common symptoms in these patients is pain.&#xD;
      Approximately 50% of patients complain of pain at some point in their lives, and pain is one&#xD;
      of the initial symptoms in 20%. Pain may originate from the musculoskeletal system; It may&#xD;
      also develop due to inflammation and upper motor neuron damage and may have a neuropathic&#xD;
      character . In conclusion, pain in MS negatively affects the physical and emotional functions&#xD;
      and quality of life of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to pharmacological treatments, non-pharmacological interventions such as&#xD;
      electrotherapy and exercise are present among the available treatments for pain in MS&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In electrotherapy applications, Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) is defined&#xD;
      as a method of applying high-frequency low-intensity electric current to the nervous system&#xD;
      through superficial electrodes placed on the painful area or the nerve innervating that area,&#xD;
      used all over the world in the treatment of pain, FDA approved in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Its effectiveness is thought to be the result of a combination of effects such as stimulation&#xD;
      of large-scale afferent fibers that inhibit the activity of primary afferent pain neurons or&#xD;
      endogenous opioid-dependent mechanisms including the release of dynorphins, enkephalins and&#xD;
      endorphins in the central nervous system .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interferential current are medium frequency currents. The analgesic effect of this current is&#xD;
      based on the gate control theory. The disadvantage compared to TENS is that it provides lower&#xD;
      neural adaptations with higher currents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result of this study, it is thought that the determination of effective treatment&#xD;
      methods for pain, which is one of the common symptoms of MS patients, will increase the&#xD;
      functional capacity and quality of life of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the study, patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be divided into 2 groups by&#xD;
      randomization, TENS will be applied to the 1st group, and interference current will be&#xD;
      applied to the 2nd group. Applications will be applied for 4 weeks, 5 days a week.&#xD;
      Evaluations will be made by a blind physiotherapist twice, before and after the treatment.&#xD;
      Assessments include sociodemographic information, pain, functional capacity, and quality of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the studies in the literature, this study will be the first to compare the&#xD;
      effectiveness of different electrical stimulations in pain in MS.&#xD;

    <description>The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) is a scale used to determine the severity of pain. Two end definitions of the parameter to be evaluated are written on the two end points of a 100 mm line and the patient is asked to indicate where his/her condition is appropriate on this line.</description>
