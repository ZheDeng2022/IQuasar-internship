    <textblock>
      This phase I trial tests the safety, side effects, and best dose of ZEN003694 and Binimetinib&#xD;
      in treating patients with solid tumors that have spread to other places in the body&#xD;
      (advanced/metastatic) or cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable) with RAS alterations.&#xD;
      ZEN003694 and binimetinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes&#xD;
      needed for cell growth. Giving ZEN003694 and binimetinib together may help shrink or&#xD;
      stabilize cancer.&#xD;

      chromatin regions in response to the ZEN003694 (ZEN-3694) and binimetinib combination using&#xD;
      assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (ATACseq). (Part 2 [Dose Expansion])&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of ZEN-3694.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive ZEN-3694 orally (PO) once daily (QD) and binimetinib PO twice daily (BID) on&#xD;
      days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 2&#xD;
      years.&#xD;

             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of&#xD;
             study participation, and 4 months after the completion of ZEN003694 (ZEN-3694) and&#xD;
             binimetinib administration. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant&#xD;
             while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her&#xD;
             treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also&#xD;
             agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study&#xD;
             participation, and 4 months after completion of ZEN003694 (ZEN-3694) and binimetinib&#xD;

          -  Prior therapy with BET, RAF, MEK, or ERK inhibitor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;

             warfarin, fondaparinux) are allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because ZEN003694 (ZEN-3694) and&#xD;
             binimetinib are a BETi and MEK inhibitor agent, respectively, with the potential for&#xD;
             teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk&#xD;
             for AEs in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with ZEN003694&#xD;

             of an orally administered drug (e.g., gastrectomy, ileal bypass, chronic diarrhea,&#xD;
             gastroparesis) are excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has a history of retinal vein occlusion&#xD;
