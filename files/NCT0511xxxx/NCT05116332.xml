  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators postulate that there is a difference in the acquisition of fundamental&#xD;
      laparoscopic skills (FLS) between general surgical and Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology (O&amp;G)&#xD;
      trainees, although not investigated previously. This discrepancy is also likely to influence&#xD;
      the musculoskeletal and cognitive fatigue trainees experience within both specialties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, there is likely to be a discrepancy in the expectations by consultants and&#xD;
      trainees on skills perceived to be important at the completion of training (CCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to compare and evaluate the discrepancy in FLS acquisition amongst O&amp;G and GS&#xD;
      trainees in order to identify areas for improvement in the training pathway, the associated&#xD;
      fatigue experience and highlight the expectations perceived to be required at the completion&#xD;
      of training.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic surgery (LS) is currently the gold standard for many operative procedures in&#xD;
      general surgery and obstetrics and gynecology (O&amp;G). However, the psychomotor skills of&#xD;
      laparoscopic surgery can be difficult to develop and trainees pursuing a laparoscopic&#xD;
      surgical career often face a steep learning curve. Whilst simulation-based training can lead&#xD;
      to a demonstrable acquisition of transferrable laparoscopic skills,(1) they must be&#xD;
      considered an adjunct rather than a substitute for in-theatre operating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both specialties, obtaining adequate exposure to operative work is a multifaceted&#xD;
      challenge for the trainees as well as those involved in designing and delivering surgical&#xD;
      training. Amongst other factors, NHS pressures driving service provision, European Working&#xD;
      Time Directive (EWTD), loss of firm structures, and the cost of training to the trainees&#xD;
      themselves have been identified as factors affecting the quality of surgical training in the&#xD;
      UK. (2,3) This is reflected in annual training surveys highlighting concerns over loss of&#xD;
      practical training and experience across both specialties.(4,5,6) Within O&amp;G, when obtaining&#xD;
      a Certificate of Completion of Training (CCT), there is concern that trainees lack the&#xD;
      confidence and skills to perform the same breadth of procedures as the previous generation.&#xD;
      (3) An intra deanery survey showed that 67% of O&amp;G trainees felt inadequately prepared for&#xD;
      CCT(8). In 2012, an analysis of 155 successful applications for CCT in general surgery (GS)&#xD;
      revealed that only 67% of the cohort had achieved the logbook requirement of 1600 cases and&#xD;
      around 73% had the necessary experience in index procedures(9). There is currently no&#xD;
      literature to highlight expectations and opinions of consultants or programme directors&#xD;
      reagrding trainees' skills within GS or O&amp;G in the UK, which the investigators believe to be&#xD;
      one of the indicators of training standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whilst the requirements for CCT for general operative skills in open and laparoscopic surgery&#xD;
      are comparable in both specialties, the training pathways defer significantly. GS training is&#xD;
      8 years in duration (CT1, CT2, ST3-ST8), whereas O&amp;G consists of 7 years of specialty&#xD;
      training (ST1-ST7). The ST1-ST5 years in O&amp;G is mainly devoted to obstetrics and only those&#xD;
      trainees pursuing a gynaecological training pathway undertake an intensive period of surgical&#xD;
      training in the last two years of their training. The investigators believe there is also&#xD;
      earlier exposure to laparoscopy in GS training with a greater volume of laparoscopic work in&#xD;
      comparison to O&amp;G training. So far there is no direct comparison of O&amp;G and GS training&#xD;
      pathways and outcomes in laparoscopic skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is known that greater exposure to laparoscopic training is associated with &quot;muscle memory&quot;&#xD;
      and may contribute to reducing the physical and mental stress of the surgeon. It is not known&#xD;
      whether the existing training is sufficient to meet the demands of a laparoscopic&#xD;
      gynaecological or GS consultant or whether the differences in training affect the development&#xD;
      of fundamental laparoscopic skills (FLS). These FLS include spatial awareness, hand-eye&#xD;
      coordination, bimanual dexterity, and laparoscopic suturing. The investigators would expect&#xD;
      trainees to be better at FLS with more laparoscopic surgery exposure. The measurement of&#xD;
      muscular and cognitive fatigue can be regarded as a surrogate marker of exposure to&#xD;
      laparoscopy giving further insights into the quality of laparoscopic training between the two&#xD;
      training programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of the study include; To compare FLS in O&amp;G and GS trainees at ST3/4/5 and&#xD;
      those in their final 2 years [ST7/8(GS) and ST6/7 (O&amp;G)], to compare the musculoskeletal and&#xD;
      cognitive fatigue experienced by O&amp;G and GS trainees in performing FLS as a marker of their&#xD;
      competence, and to compare the standards of laparoscopic ability expected from trainees by&#xD;
      experienced GS and gynecological consultants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This is a prospective comparative study and the investigators will recruit&#xD;
      participants from professional membership bodies and the North West health education formerly&#xD;
      known as the North West deanery. The study is divided into two parts. In part 1, Consultants&#xD;
      and trainees from O&amp;G and GS specialties will be contacted electronically through&#xD;
      professional membership bodies (O&amp;G consultants through RCOG/BSGE, GS consultants through&#xD;
      ASGBI, O&amp;G trainees through RCOG/BSGE, and GS trainees through ASiT). In addition to the&#xD;
      above communication methods, the investigators will consider the use of social media and&#xD;
      direct emails to increase the survey response rate. The consultants and trainees will be&#xD;
      requested to fill out an online short questionnaire designed to assess trainees perceptions&#xD;
      of FLS required at CCT and the consultants' expectations of laparoscopic competencies&#xD;
      required by trainees at CCT. These surveys will not include any personal details and will be&#xD;
      returned anonymously to the investigators via the survey monkey platform. In the second part,&#xD;
      the investigators will recruit trainees from the two specialties via the North West deanery&#xD;
      by sending out a centralized email requesting them to volunteer for the FLS tasks. In&#xD;
      addition to the above recruitment methods, the investigators will consider the use of social&#xD;
      media and direct emails to increase trainee recruitment for the study. Trainees will be able&#xD;
      to volunteer their help by replying to a secure email address. Those trainees who respond and&#xD;
      meet the inclusion criteria will subsequently be invited to attend a study day to perform&#xD;
      four FLS tasks with a choice of 6 days across 3 possible weekends. On the day, trainees will&#xD;
      be asked to fill out another short questionnaire to gather some demographic information and&#xD;
      account for potential confounding variables. Personal details from these questionnaires will&#xD;
      be separated and a study number will be randomly allocated to both parts of the&#xD;
      questionnaires and this number will be written on the trainee's badge which will be used for&#xD;
      filling out the task evaluation sheets. A single sheet of paper will allow the investigators&#xD;
      recognize the study number against the relevant trainee in case there is a need to contact&#xD;
      them at some point. This form will be securely stored in a locked cabinet in an NHS locked&#xD;
      office accessible only to the research team. A sub-selection of trainees will be randomly&#xD;
      chosen to have an electromyography (EMG) and electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring whilst&#xD;
      performing the tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are four FLS tasks and they are carried out using validated training models called&#xD;
      LASTT (Laparoscopic Skills Training and Testing method) and SUTT-1 (Suturing and knot tying&#xD;
      Training and Testing method). LASTT is a wooden model and SUTT-1 is a foam sponge. The tasks&#xD;
      are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Laparoscopic Camera Navigation; Laparoscopic camera navigation (LCN) assesses the&#xD;
           trainee's ability to navigate a 30 degrees camera using either their dominant hand (DH)&#xD;
           or their non-dominant hand (NDH). The task requires the trainee to insert a 10mm 30&#xD;
           degrees optic through the central port of the Szabo box trainer. 14 targets will be&#xD;
           dispersed around the LASTT model. Each target contains a large size character (either a&#xD;
           large number or a large alphabet letter) and a small size character (either a number or&#xD;
           an alphabet letter). The large character can be seen from a panoramic field but the&#xD;
           smaller character requires the trainee to zoom in. The trainees will be required to&#xD;
           sequentially locate all targets whilst being timed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hand-eye coordination (HEC); Task 2 - Hand-eye co-ordination (HEC) To assess HEC,&#xD;
           trainees are assessed on their ability to transfer objects as well as navigate the&#xD;
           camera. The trainee is expected to use the dominant hand (DH) to hold grasping forceps&#xD;
           and the non-dominant hand (NDH) to hold the camera. The LASTT model will be used to&#xD;
           assess this. There will be coloured cylinders of different colours, which the trainees&#xD;
           will be required to place in corresponding coloured targets nails.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Bimanual co-ordination (BMC); BMC is assessed by measuring the time taken for a trainee&#xD;
           to transfer 6 objects between their DH and NDH and position them correctly on the LASTT&#xD;
           model. Coloured pins will be transferred from a central location to the corresponding&#xD;
           coloured targets. The trainees are expected to identify a coloured pushpin (e.g. red),&#xD;
           grasp it by the head with grasping forceps(Johans) using their NDH, then transfer the&#xD;
           pin to their DH and grasp the pin by its tail using curved forceps like Maryland. The&#xD;
           pushpin then needs to be placed in the corresponding disc of the same colour correctly&#xD;
           before moving on to the next coloured pushpin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Suturing and knot placement; All trainees will be shown a video demonstration of&#xD;
           laparoscopic suturing and intra-corporeal knotting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Suturing and knot tying Training and Testing method (SUTT1) foam pad will be used for&#xD;
      assessment of suturing and knot placement. This has 5 rows of dots. For this task, the top 4&#xD;
      rows are used and the 5th row is disregarded. Trainees will be expected to place interrupted&#xD;
      sutures between two dots and perform 4 intracorporeal knots with 3 throws. A total of 15&#xD;
      minutes will be allowed for this task and the time taken to complete 4 sutures and 4 knots if&#xD;
      performed will be recorded. If the trainee runs out of time, then a total number of sutures&#xD;
      +/- knots performed within the 15 minutes will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of EMG and EEG A random selection of trainees will have wireless electromyography&#xD;
      (EMG) and electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring whilst performing the above tasks. As the&#xD;
      equipment is wireless, it is anticipated that the trainee's freedom of movement will not be&#xD;
      affected by it. EMG activity will be measured in the arm, shoulder, upper and lower back&#xD;
      muscles, and the EEG activity of interest will be the alpha wave pattern observed during the&#xD;
      activities.&#xD;
