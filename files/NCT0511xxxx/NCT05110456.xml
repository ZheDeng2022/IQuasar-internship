  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women's perinatal mental health problems can create a cascade of short- and long-term&#xD;
      negative influences for the mother, child, and the family as a whole. To prevent these&#xD;
      impacts, preventive online and telephone interventions exist, but need to be tested and&#xD;
      improved to develop this type of support to women in Quebec. The Parents &amp; Babies program,&#xD;
      which is a distance learning course, followed during pregnancy and accompanied by telephone&#xD;
      follow-up, aims to improve the mental health of future parents.The investigators seek to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of the intervention of the Parents &amp; Babies program offered with&#xD;
      telephone support compared to the course offered without telephone follow-up.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Parents &amp; Babies intervention to be evaluated is an adaptation of the existing,&#xD;
      evidence-based Mothers &amp; Babies program which has shown efficacy in four clinical trials for&#xD;
      the prevention of postpartum depression through in-person (group or individual) counseling&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Parents &amp; Babies program was adapted to be virtual and include: 1) specific modules for&#xD;
      the mother-partner dyad; 2) third-wave cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) strategies&#xD;
      targeting well-being, relaxation, mindfulness, self-compassion, and gratitude; 3) confinement&#xD;
      and social distancing related material. Participants follow the program online or with a&#xD;
      paper workbook and are called weekly by a member of the intervention team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will fill out three questionnaires (online or by telephone) at 12-25 weeks'&#xD;
      gestation, 3 months' postpartum and 6-months postpartum to assess baseline values and trial&#xD;
      outcomes, respectively.&#xD;
