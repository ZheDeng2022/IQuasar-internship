  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of a home rapid test for the detection of gluten immunogenic peptides (GIP) in urine&#xD;
      of treated adolescent patients with celiac disease (CD) could facilitate the adherence to the&#xD;
      gluten-free diet (GFD) and contribute to symptoms control and quality of life improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This single centre, randomized, unblinded, controlled study consists of 4 run-in weeks period&#xD;
      followed by 8-weeks study period in which patients will be randomized to intervention group&#xD;
      (home urine GIP testing) or the control group (no home urine GIP testing). The 12-week study&#xD;
      will involve surveys, home stool and urine collection, home urine GIP test performance, and&#xD;
      two study visits with the gastroenterologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome is to determine whether the self-monitoring of the GFD with GIP testing in&#xD;
      urine improves adherence to the GFD in treated adolescent patients with CD (measured by&#xD;
      CDAT-Celiac Dietary Adherence Test, GFD adherence evaluation by gastroenterologist and rates&#xD;
      of gluten exposure in urine and/or stool measured at a central laboratory) and subsequently&#xD;
      improves quality of life (CDDUX-Coeliac Disease Dutch Questionnaire) and reduces symptoms&#xD;
      (CSI-Celiac Symptoms Index questionnaire).&#xD;

      Hypothesis: the use of a home rapid test for the detection of gluten immunogenic peptides&#xD;
      (GIP) in urine of treated adolescent patients with celiac disease (CD) could facilitate the&#xD;
      adherence to the gluten-free diet (GFD) and contribute to symptoms control and quality of&#xD;
      life improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: to determine in adolescent patients with CD whether the self-monitoring of&#xD;
      the GFD with GIP testing in urine changes treatment adherence (intervention group) in&#xD;
      comparison with patients that do not use the test (control group) measured by 1 - CDAT-Celiac&#xD;
      Dietary Adherence Test; 2 - GFD adherence evaluation by gastroenterologist; 3- Detection&#xD;
      rates of GIP in urine and/or stool (to be measured at a central laboratory); 4- Detection&#xD;
      rates of GIP in urine (to be measured by home rapid tests).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives: to determine whether the use of the home test for GIP detection in&#xD;
      urine samples of treated patients with CD leads to 1 - change of quality of life&#xD;
      (CDDUX-Coeliac Disease Dutch Questionnaire); 2- change of symptoms (CSI-Celiac Symptoms Index&#xD;
      questionnaire).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Single centre, randomized, unblinded, controlled, study. The study will consist&#xD;
      of 4 run-in weeks period followed by 8-weeks study period in which patients will be&#xD;
      randomized to intervention (home urine GIP testing) or the control group (no home urine GIP&#xD;
      testing).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants: adolescent patients with CD, diagnosed by European Society for Paediatric&#xD;
      Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) guidelines, that have been following a&#xD;
      strict GFD for at least 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Run-in period (4 weeks): all participants will: A- complete quality of life&#xD;
           questionnaire (CDDUX); B - complete GFD adherence questionnaire (CDAT); C - complete&#xD;
           food diary for 4 consecutive days and GFD adherence will be evaluated by&#xD;
           gastroenterologist; D - complete symptom questionnaire (CSI); E - be instructed in the&#xD;
           use of the tests and sample collection; F - collect at the beginning and end of the&#xD;
           period urine and stool samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study weeks (8): patients will be randomized to either the control or the study group by&#xD;
           block randomization (size 4) using WINPEPI (Programs for epidemiologists for Windows)&#xD;
           v11.65 (Abramson, J.H.). The study group will receive home use tests for GFD monitoring&#xD;
           to be used at their discretion (but using at least 8 tests during the study period&#xD;
           (1/week) so that they may receive immediate qualitative feedback regarding the presence&#xD;
           of biomarkers of gluten exposure in their urine and they will have to register the&#xD;
           results obtained. The control group will not receive the tests. Additionally, all&#xD;
           patients will collect a urine and a stool sample every 4 weeks with the purpose of&#xD;
           evaluating their adherence to the GFD. All collected samples will be kept frozen until&#xD;
           their analysis and will be brought to the centre by the patients at the end of the&#xD;
           study. All samples will be sent to a central laboratory for their analysis (Biomedal&#xD;
           S.L., Seville, Spain).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. At the end of the study, patients will be evaluated as in the run-in period&#xD;
           (post-intervention).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of participants: with an alpha risk of 5%, a beta risk of 20% (80% of statistical&#xD;
      power) and an estimated rate reduction of 0.33 the sample size needed was 66 subjects (33&#xD;
      subjects per group). The calculation was made using the tool Calculadora de Grand√†ria Mostral&#xD;
      (GRANMO) v7.12 April 2012 (Municipal Institute of Medical Research, Barcelona, Spain).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements: 1- Home rapid test (GlutenDetect, Biomedal S.L., Seville, Spain) for GIP&#xD;
      determination in urine samples, laboratory rapid test (iVYCHECK GIP Urine, Biomedal S.L.,&#xD;
      Seville, Spain) for GIP determination in urine samples and ELISA test (iVYLISA GIP Stool,&#xD;
      Biomedal S.L., Seville, Spain) for GIP determination in stool samples; 2- CD related symptoms&#xD;
      (CSI questionnaire); 3- quality of life questionnaire (CDDUX); 4- GFD adherence questionnaire&#xD;
      (CDAT); 5- GFD adherence evaluation by specialist (questionnaire and food diary); 6 - test&#xD;
      results for the study group. Samples will be analysed in a central laboratory (Biomedal S.L.,&#xD;
      Seville, Spain).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: Will be done with IBM SPSS Statistics 25.0 for Windows (IBM&#xD;
      Corporation, Armonk, New York, United States). 1- Difference in all parameters between and&#xD;
      within the control and the study groups. Results will be compared at baseline, week 4 and&#xD;
      week 12. 2- Differences in all parameters between patients with positive GIP testing compared&#xD;
      to those with negative GIP testing (both home and laboratory GIP measurements). 3 - number of&#xD;
      additional tests used by the patients since they will receive 24 tests and they must perform&#xD;
      only 8 tests. They can use the additional test at their discretion.&#xD;
