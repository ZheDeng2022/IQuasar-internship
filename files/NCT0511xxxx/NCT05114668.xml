  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of EVT801 in&#xD;
      subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumours. The study also aims to determine the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and / or a recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of EVT801 when&#xD;
      administered daily to subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study comprises two stages, each with distinct purposes, patient populations, and&#xD;
      procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stage 1: a multiple ascending dose escalation of EVT801 to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
           tolerability of EVT801 and to determine MTD / RP2D in subjects with advanced solid&#xD;
           tumours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stage 2: a biomarker expansion cohort, in which all subjects will receive EVT801 at the&#xD;
           MTD / RP2D, to explore pharmacodynamic outcomes and further elucidate tolerability,&#xD;
           activity, and pharmacokinetics.&#xD;

      Stage 1 - Dose Escalation Cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1 is a multiple ascending dose escalation of EVT801 in patients with advanced solid&#xD;
      tumours to determine MTD / RP2D for further investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing screening and signing informed consent, subjects will be enrolled. The first&#xD;
      dose of study drug will be administered at the site, and patients will undergo intensive PK&#xD;
      assessment for 48 hours before receiving the second and subsequent doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first subject in Stage 1 will receive EVT801 at a dose of 50 mg QD (Quaque Die: once&#xD;
      daily) (Dose Level 1). If no Doses Limiting Toxicity (DLTs) are observed in a 28-day period,&#xD;
      the second subject may be enrolled at Dose Level 2. The study will proceed by way of&#xD;
      single-patient cohorts until (a) treatment-related toxicity of at least Grade 2 is observed,&#xD;
      or (b) Dose Level 5 is reached, or (c) the Principal Investigator, in consultation with the&#xD;
      sponsor, determines that it is appropriate to transition to larger cohorts. At this point,&#xD;
      the study will move to a conventional 3+3 design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a DLT is observed in any cohort, that cohort will expand to six patients. If two DLTs are&#xD;
      observed at a given dose level, the prior dose level will be declared the MTD, and Stage 1&#xD;
      will be deemed complete. If the prior dose level had recruited only a single patient, then&#xD;
      that dose level will be expanded to three patients, such that the MTD will have been&#xD;
      administered to a minimum of three patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If two DLTs are observed at Dose Level 2 (100 mg QD), a de-escalation cohort (Dose Level -1)&#xD;
      will enrol three patients in order to establish the viability of twice-daily dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the MTD has been established, the sponsor will evaluate, in consultation with the&#xD;
      investigators, whether that dose or a lower dose should be used for subsequent investigation&#xD;
      (the RP2D). This evaluation will be based on a consideration of broader factors than safety,&#xD;
      including PK and PD. The RP2D shall under no circumstances be greater than the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sequence of doses examined will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
      50 mg QD → 100 mg QD (→50 mg BID [Bis In Die (i.e. twice daily)] if 2 DLTs / 6 patients @ 100&#xD;
      mg QD) → 100 mg BID → 200 mg BID → 400 mg BID → 500 mg BID → 600 mg BID → 800 mg BID (up to 8&#xD;
      cohorts).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of at least two cycles at the dose level to which they were initially&#xD;
      assigned, individual subjects may escalate to higher dose levels, providing the higher dose&#xD;
      level has (a) been administered to at least one patient for at least 28 days without grade 2&#xD;
      treatment-related toxicity, or (b) been administered to at least three subjects for at least&#xD;
      28 days without a DLT, or (c) been administered to at least six subjects for at least 28 days&#xD;
      with no more than one DLT. A given subject may escalate through multiple dose levels in this&#xD;
      fashion, providing the aforementioned criteria continue to be satisfied and the patient has&#xD;
      no ongoing clinically significant adverse event &gt; grade 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2 - Biomarker Expansion Cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately following determination of the MTD / RP2D in Stage 1, Stage 2 will open to&#xD;
      recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2 comprises two sub-components:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stage 2A :patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stage 2B: patients with advanced soft-tissue sarcoma. Subjects may be enrolled in&#xD;
           parallel, as they become available through screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects in Stage 2 will receive EVT801 at the MTD / RP2D established in Stage 1.&#xD;
