      This study proposes to characterize skeletal muscle amino acid kinetics to an EAA challenge,&#xD;
      i.e., an oral amino acid tolerance test (OATT), in order to determine the state of muscle&#xD;
      health. Analogous to the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) used to characterize alterations&#xD;
      in glucose metabolism, the proposed OATT represents a potential low-cost solution to&#xD;
      classifying patients' skeletal muscle health. The extrapolation of this work is the&#xD;
      development of a simple analytical tool that would provide clinicians the ability to discern&#xD;
      alterations in muscle amino acid kinetics prior to a loss of function.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Sarcopenia increases the risk of a number of deleterious health conditions and represents a&#xD;
      major financial cost to our healthcare system. Among older adults who are hospitalized, those&#xD;
      with sarcopenia on admission are 5-fold more likely to incur higher hospital costs than those&#xD;
      without. The operational definition of sarcopenia is defined as meeting the criteria for all&#xD;
      of the following: low muscle strength, low muscle quantity or quality, and low physical&#xD;
      performance. The diagnosis of sarcopenia requires techniques that are both expensive and&#xD;
      operator-dependent. Simple measurements, such as BMI, do not necessarily identify sarcopenia.&#xD;
      Importantly, current techniques can only identify sarcopenia after a physical/functional&#xD;
      impairment has occurred. Skeletal muscle amino acid kinetics predict muscle health and&#xD;
      functionality. Altered amino acid kinetics lead to decrements in muscle mass, quality, and&#xD;
      performance. Muscle response to circulating essential amino acids (EAA) determines muscle&#xD;
      amino acid kinetics. Thus, this study proposes to characterize skeletal muscle amino acid&#xD;
      kinetics to an EAA challenge, i.e., an oral amino acid tolerance test (OATT), in order to&#xD;
      determine the state of muscle health. Analogous to the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)&#xD;
      used to characterize alterations in glucose metabolism, the proposed OATT represents a&#xD;
      potential low-cost solution to classifying patients' skeletal muscle health. The&#xD;
      extrapolation of this work is the development of a simple analytical tool that would provide&#xD;
      clinicians the ability to discern alterations in muscle amino acid kinetics prior to a loss&#xD;
      of function.&#xD;
