  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Around 3,300 people are diagnosed with soft tissue sarcoma (STS) each year in the UK, and a&#xD;
      significant proportion of STS diagnoses are in people aged under 30 years. STS can arise from&#xD;
      various tissue types and is comprised of over 50 tumour types. Although STS is treated with a&#xD;
      combination of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, the prognosis is relatively poor with&#xD;
      a five-year survival rate of 54%. There is an unmet need for further treatment modalities in&#xD;
      STS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a non-invasive way of treating cancers with&#xD;
      minimal side effects, low complication rate and quick recovery. Ultrasound waves are used to&#xD;
      destroy tumour cells and improvements in technology and experience are enabling complete&#xD;
      destruction of tumour. HIFU also releases tumour antigens, increasing the immune response&#xD;
      against cancer. HIFU has received FDA approvals for several indications, including bone&#xD;
      metastases and we are using a CE-approved HIFU device in Oxford (UKCA-approvals anticipated&#xD;
      for 2023). There have been some publications from China showing promise in STS, however this&#xD;
      technology needs further evaluation within the UK's healthcare setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will recruit patients with both resectable and unresectable STS, in addition to&#xD;
      unresectable small symptomatic desmoid tumours. 12-16 patients, and a minimum of 10 patients&#xD;
      with malignant STS, will be treated over a maximum recruitment period of three years. HIFU&#xD;
      treatment will be carried out as a day case procedure, and patients will be expected to be&#xD;
      discharged home the same day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed to generate evidence regarding safety and feasibility of HIFU for&#xD;
      ablation of STS and intra-abdominal desmoids. In addition, the study is anticipated to&#xD;
      provide information about the efficacy of HIFU against these tumour types which can help in&#xD;
      the design of later phase studies. Short-term outcomes include feasibility, safety and the&#xD;
      completeness of destruction of the tumour. Long-term outcomes include one-year survival,&#xD;
      local recurrence and quality of life metrics (including pain scores). The study will also&#xD;
      look at immunological response following ablation of STS using both blood and tumour samples&#xD;
      pre- and post-HIFU ablation.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tissues that can be affected by soft tissue sarcomas include fat, muscle, blood vessels,&#xD;
      nerves, deep skin tissues, tendons and ligaments. Sarcoma accounts for 1% of all cancer&#xD;
      diagnoses; around 3,300 people are diagnosed with soft tissue sarcoma (STS) each year in the&#xD;
      UK. The incidence of STS is unusual for cancer in that a relatively large proportion can&#xD;
      occur in children and young adults, with 9% of cases in the under 30-year group and only 43%&#xD;
      of cases in the 65 and over group. Whilst STS is rare, it remains a significant cause of&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. Prognosis is typically poor, with a five-year overall survival of&#xD;
      approximately 54%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Oxford Bone and Soft Tissue Tumour Service at the Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre, Oxford, is&#xD;
      a nationally approved tertiary referral centre for the treatment of soft tissue and primary&#xD;
      bone sarcomas, receiving 400 new patient referrals annually. These patients are currently&#xD;
      treated via a multidisciplinary approach involving expert radiologists, surgeons, clinical&#xD;
      oncologists and histopathologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At our centre, patients with smaller (&lt;5cm) STS proceed directly to surgical resection; this&#xD;
      provides a low-risk opportunity to evaluate safety, feasibility and efficacy of novel&#xD;
      pre-operative non-ionising ablative technologies, such as High Intensity Focused Ultrasound&#xD;
      (HIFU). Patients with larger (&gt;5cm) resectable STS currently receive neoadjuvant radiotherapy&#xD;
      within six weeks of surgery, in line with national guidelines (Dangoor, 2016). Upon&#xD;
      recurrence within the radiotherapy field (in-field recurrence), radiotherapy has high&#xD;
      morbidity, including complications such as poor wound healing and infection (Tsagozis, 2018),&#xD;
      and is not indicated prior to further surgical resection. Thus, in resectable cases of&#xD;
      in-field recurrence, there is further opportunity to evaluate non-invasive HIFU, anticipated&#xD;
      to both reduce tumour size and tumour vascularity, facilitating subsequent surgical&#xD;
      resection. Furthermore, recurrent STS or metastatic STS not suitable for surgery have limited&#xD;
      treatment options, and if not suitable for further chemo- or radio-therapy, HIFU may provide&#xD;
      an alternative treatment option before palliation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIFU is a versatile treatment modality capable of destruction of tumours by focusing&#xD;
      ultrasound waves from outside the body, usually through the medium of water, to cause&#xD;
      ablation at a precise anatomical location.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has demonstrated an impressive safety profile by virtue of being both non-invasive and&#xD;
      lacking radiation, leading to FDA approvals for several indications including pain relief in&#xD;
      bone metastases (Scipione, 2018) and uterine fibroids. Previous studies using an&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided therapeutic device in China have demonstrated that HIFU is a successful&#xD;
      treatment modality for soft tissue sarcoma (Yu, 2019), but this treatment has currently not&#xD;
      been widely investigated within the UK's health care setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The University of Oxford and the Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust have extensive&#xD;
      clinical HIFU experience. The first extracorporeal HIFU device in Europe was used for a study&#xD;
      performed at the Churchill Hospital between 2002 and 2004 (Illing, 2005). The study used an&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided HIFU system (Model-JC Tumour Therapy System, HAIFU Technology Company Ltd,&#xD;
      Chongqing, China) to treat 30 patients with tumour deposits in the kidney or liver and&#xD;
      demonstrated both safety and efficacy. This was followed by a non-randomised Phase II&#xD;
      clinical trial of HIFU ablation of liver tumours (Leslie, 2008), which compared radiological&#xD;
      response against histological findings and again demonstrated safety and feasibility for&#xD;
      non-invasive treatment of solid tumour deposits. These studies have led to CE-marking of the&#xD;
      JC and JC-200 treatment devices for non-invasive treatment of solid tumours such as liver&#xD;
      cancer, kidney tumours, breast cancer, bone tumours, pancreatic tumours and uterine fibroids,&#xD;
      based on previous clinical trials at our unit (Lyon, 2019), the latter indication recently&#xD;
      receiving NICE approval for US-guided HIFU ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and efficacy of HIFU has already been demonstrated for sacral chordoma in our&#xD;
      institution (Gillies, 2016). Due to the highly targeted capabilities of HIFU, whilst leaving&#xD;
      superficial skin and pre-focal tissues unharmed, the ablative technology may have a role in&#xD;
      treating local recurrence following previous neoadjuvant radiotherapy. For example, following&#xD;
      recurrence, HIFU may be able to facilitate conversion from amputation for local control to&#xD;
      limb salvage surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Desmoid tumours are a relatively poorly understood subtype of STS which are benign and do not&#xD;
      metastasise. However, this tumour subtype demonstrates characteristics of aggressive&#xD;
      fibromatosis and comes with significant morbidity and mortality due to their locally invasive&#xD;
      nature and, in the familial form, typical bowel involvement. Treatment options are limited&#xD;
      and poorly evaluated; mortality is 34% in patients undergoing surgery for intra-abdominal&#xD;
      desmoid and post-resection recurrence rates for abdominal wall and intra-abdominal desmoids&#xD;
      are 41% and 71% respectively (Sturt, 2006). By virtue of not disrupting the tissue planes,&#xD;
      promoting further fibromatosis, HIFU has previously been used on desmoid tumours in small&#xD;
      case series outside the UK and have demonstrated encouraging outcomes for both extra- and&#xD;
      intra-abdominal desmoid tumours (Shi, 2016), (Ghanouni, 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIFU is an attractive treatment modality for these indications due to its excellent safety&#xD;
      profile, versatility in treating a range of tumour locations (Shim, 2016), its capability to&#xD;
      treat multiple smaller tumours in a single session and, furthermore, being repeatable due to&#xD;
      the lack of ionising radiation. Oxford has over two-decades of world-class expertise in&#xD;
      clinical HIFU with published experiences in translational research of many benign and&#xD;
      malignant solid tumour subtypes (Iling, 2005), (Lyon, 2019), (Gilies, 2016), (Leslie, 2012),&#xD;
      (Lyon, 2018), (Wu, 2004), (Kennedy, 2004). As the Chinese JC200 device used in Oxford uses&#xD;
      diagnostic ultrasound through a water bath to target tumours, rather than an integrated MRI&#xD;
      tunnel, treatment of tumours at a variety of anatomical locations becomes both more practical&#xD;
      and financially economical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical HIFU service is complimented by an extensive pre-clinical therapeutic ultrasound&#xD;
      research facility at the Institute of Biomedical Engineering, University of Oxford. This&#xD;
      laboratory has provided expertise in treatment planning for a previous HIFU clinical trial&#xD;
      using patient specific models which employ CT data (Gray, 2019). The multidisciplinary team&#xD;
      of co-investigators and other researchers in Oxford have world-class expertise in academic&#xD;
      and musculoskeletal radiology, sarcoma surgery, sarcoma radiotherapy and oncology, clinical&#xD;
      histopathology and immunology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, in Oxford there is a unique opportunity to explore the utility of preoperative HIFU in&#xD;
      the ablation of infield recurrent STS, smaller STS and desmoid tumours as a pilot study. The&#xD;
      primary outcome measure of the study will be safety and feasibility. Radiological response&#xD;
      will be explored as a secondary endpoints of efficacy using cross sectional (MRI) and&#xD;
      functional imaging (18F-FDG PET), incorporating both size, perfusion and metabolic activity.&#xD;
      In addition, novel MRI sequences (DWI including whole body MRI, CEST) may also be explored&#xD;
      with the academic radiology department, which pose minimal addition risk to the patient&#xD;
      (Chetan, 2019), (Schmidt, 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Crucially, post-resection histology will permit histopathological correlation, mitigating&#xD;
      against the possibility of falsely reassuring radiological evaluations (false positive&#xD;
      complete ablations). Tertiary endpoints will explore immune response, which HIFU has been&#xD;
      demonstrated to mediate (Wu 2004), (Wu, 2016), both through circulating blood markers and&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry. This is of importance, as whilst this study may demonstrate safe and&#xD;
      effective ablation of targeted STS tumours, there may be micro-metastases or known metastases&#xD;
      elsewhere which may limit the overall survival. Thus, thorough understanding of the immune&#xD;
      mechanisms at play during HIFU ablation may inform future complimentary systemic treatments.&#xD;
      Whilst one other centre has recently published early HIFU experience in STS [6], we believe&#xD;
      our proposed study will be the first to elucidate immune mechanisms in HIFU-ablation of STS,&#xD;
      and the first trial of HIFU for STS in Europe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain scores and quality of life metrics will also be captured both pre- and post-HIFU and&#xD;
      this qualitative data can be used to demonstrate that the HIFU procedure was acceptable to&#xD;
      the patient.&#xD;
