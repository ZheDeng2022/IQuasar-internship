  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intractable high intracranial pressures (ICP) are associated with poor functional outcomes&#xD;
      and mortality, so the SCALPEL trials aims to evaluate the effect of decompressive craniectomy&#xD;
      against decompressive laparotomy to lower those pressures in diffuse TBI. The primary outcome&#xD;
      measure for that evaluation is functional outcome after 12 months on the extended Glasgow&#xD;
      Outcome Scale (GOS-E).&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale for trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traumatic brain injuries (TBI) are held responsible for about half of the trauma related&#xD;
      death rate and a main driver of trauma related morbidity. While outcomes from trauma have&#xD;
      improved in the last decades, the mortality and morbidity caused by TBI stayed about the&#xD;
      same.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgical interventions for raised ICP in TBI have been studied extensively with varying&#xD;
      outcome. Craniectomy did reduce mortality in several trials. There were additional survivors&#xD;
      with favorable neurological outcome, as well as additional survivors with poor functional&#xD;
      outcome. That effect might partly be explained by the inherent morbidity of the craniectomy&#xD;
      or the consecutive cranioplasty. Various studies have shown surgical complications post&#xD;
      cranioplasty in around one third of the cases including reoperation for hematoma,&#xD;
      hydrocephalus, seizures, and graft infections and there is evidence for negative effects due&#xD;
      to the rapid decompression of the pressure as growing hematoma size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Decompressive laparotomy (DL) on the other side is thought to lower not only the dynamic&#xD;
      pulsatile effect on the brain, it also causes increased venous outflow from the brain which&#xD;
      reduces the intracranially present amount of venous blood and therefore ICP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that a decompressive laparotomy may have the benefit of lowering the ICP,&#xD;
      without the inherent risks and complications caused by a large craniectomy and its influence&#xD;
      on long-term outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial seeks to inform future guidelines about this potentially alternative intervention&#xD;
      in TBI patients. Another potential benefit might be in the applicability of the findings in&#xD;
      settings without neurosurgical capabilities (expertise or instruments) like in military&#xD;
      conflicts, rural areas, or developing countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the treating team involving a neurosurgeon and a general, abdominal, or trauma surgeon&#xD;
      depending on the local setting and jurisdiction agree that the participant matches the&#xD;
      eligibility criteria, consent is given and no exclusion criteria are met, the participant can&#xD;
      be enrolled in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolment of a participant:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a potential participant is admitted to a study center the local principal investigator&#xD;
      (PI) is informed. If the local team is uncertain about eligibility or exclusion, advice from&#xD;
      a senior clinician of the trial management committee (TMC) will be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If after all there is still uncertainty about the potential eligibility, the patient will not&#xD;
      be enrolled in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By definition the included participants will be unable to give written consent to&#xD;
      participation in this study. In those cases, the investigators plan to discuss the procedures&#xD;
      and the trial with the next of kin and acquire consent for the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are cases imaginable when the next of kin is unknown, cannot be reached, or there is no&#xD;
      time to arrive and have that detailed discussion, due to the emergence of that immediate&#xD;
      life-threatening condition. Those situations are covered by the Declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
      Detailed standard operating procedures as discussed in the SCALPEL Study Protocol, will be&#xD;
      put in place together with the participating centers and the ethical monitoring board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to set up 10 international centers in order to increase external&#xD;
      validity of the trial and to complete the inclusion phase within 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The medical and interventional therapies included in step I and II are representing the&#xD;
      current standard of care and are discussed extensively in the guidelines for severe traumatic&#xD;
      brain injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step I includes head elevation 30-45°, adequate sedation, neuroprotective ventilation,&#xD;
      sufficient analgesia and the use of vasopressors if necessary to support cerebral perfusion&#xD;
      pressure. Monitoring includes measurement of ICP, IAP, and mean airway pressure. Those&#xD;
      measures are all considered to be mandatory before progressing to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step II includes ventriculostomy and drainage of CSF, infusion of mannitol or hypertonic&#xD;
      saline, as well as therapeutic hypothermia. Those measures are considered to be facultative.&#xD;
      The latter two are not of proven value, or might even be harmful, so the local team can very&#xD;
      well skip those measures with respect to the local centers guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the ICP remains over 25 mmHg for 1-12h and the inclusion criteria are met, without any&#xD;
      exclusion criteria the patient can be randomized in the surgical intervention groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If randomized to the craniectomy treatment arm, it is discretionary to the treating&#xD;
      neurosurgeon if a bifrontal vs. frontotemporoparietal hemicraniectomy is performed, depending&#xD;
      on the clinical situation and local protocols. The bone flap should be generous. Secondary to&#xD;
      the decompression there will be the necessity for a cranioplasty after resolving of the brain&#xD;
      swelling 2 to 20 weeks after craniectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The performance of the decompressive craniectomy is described in the Appendix B of the&#xD;
      SCALPEL Study Protocol - Best practice guideline for the decompressive craniectomy in the&#xD;
      SCALPEL trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If randomized to the laparotomy treatment arm, A long median laparotomy will be performed in&#xD;
      the laparotomy group. The skin and fascia is left open after that as a laparostomy. It is&#xD;
      covered by a negative pressure dressing or other adequate laparostomy dressings according to&#xD;
      the local protocols. A traction-free mesh should be used with the fascial edges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To further improve the procedural safety and effectiveness the investigators plan to monitor&#xD;
      the effect on ICP for one hour directly in the operating theater after the negative pressure&#xD;
      dressing is applied and before the patient is transferred to the neurosurgical ICU.&#xD;
      Neurocritical care measures like head elevation 30-45°, adequate sedation, neuroprotective&#xD;
      ventilation, sufficient analgesia and the use of vasopressors if necessary to support&#xD;
      cerebral perfusion pressure, will be performed during that period as it would be done on the&#xD;
      ICU ward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary to the decompression the closure of the fascia and skin is needed. If the ICP and&#xD;
      neurological recovery of the patient allows, it is encouraged to perform the closure around&#xD;
      7-14 days after decompression. In the case-control study out of the Shock Trauma Center&#xD;
      survivors were allowed to granulate and then closed with Vicryl mesh and split thickness skin&#xD;
      grafting, this option is not recommended anymore due to improved laparostomy management. The&#xD;
      performance of the decompressive laparotomy and the management of the open abdomen is&#xD;
      described in the Appendix A of the SCALPEL Study Protocol - Best practice guideline for the&#xD;
      decompressive laparotomy in the SCALPEL trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      GOS-E and EQ-5D will be evaluated at follow-up at 6 and 12 months in keeping with the IMPACT&#xD;
      group recommendations. The investigators will use postal questionnaires, pre-paid envelopes,&#xD;
      phone call reminders, structured phone call interviews and face-to-face interviews if&#xD;
      necessary. The protocol does not allow members of the acute care team to participate in those&#xD;
      interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaires will be collected centrally, and two examiners will determine the outcome&#xD;
      scores independently from each other.&#xD;
