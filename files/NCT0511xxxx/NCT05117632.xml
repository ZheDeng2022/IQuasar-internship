    <measure>To understand the relationship between baseline biology and clinical outcome with ALTO-100 using the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured 5 times over 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) measures the severity of depression where smaller scores indicate less depression and higher scores suggest more severe depression. Possible scores for this 10 item version range from 0 to 60. The change from baseline to the end of the study is the primary outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To understand the relationship between baseline biology and clinical outcome with ALTO-100 using the Clinical Global Impression scale - Severity (CGI-S)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured 5 times over 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Global Impression scale - Severity (CGI-S) measures the severity of psychopathology in general where smaller scores indicate less illness and higher scores suggest more severe illness. Possible scores for this scale range from 1 to 7. The change from baseline to the end of the study is the primary outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To understand the relationship between baseline biology and clinical outcome with ALTO-100 using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured 3 times over 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) measures the severity of PTSD where smaller scores indicate less severe PTSD and higher scores suggest more severe PTSD. Possible scores for this 30 item version range from 0 to 120. The change from baseline to the end of the study is the primary outcome.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs) as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability of ALTO-100</measure>
    <time_frame>From the signing of the ICF until the follow-up visit (up to 12 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical event that occurs in a participant administered an investigational product, and it does not necessarily indicate only events with clear causal relationship with the relevant investigational product.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Vital Signs Abnormalities as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability of ALTO-100</measure>
    <time_frame>From the signing of the ICF until the end-of-treatment visit (up to 11 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Vital signs measured include blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature, and weight.</description>
