  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized comparison of pericapsular nerve group (PENG) blocks with&#xD;
      bupivacaine and a placebo control (PENG blocks with normal saline). The overall objective of&#xD;
      the proposed research is to determine the relative risks and benefits of a single-injection&#xD;
      PENG block to provide postoperative analgesia following hip arthroscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Following hip arthroscopy, participants with a PENG block will experience less&#xD;
      pain in the recovery room compared with current standard-of-care as measured with the Numeric&#xD;
      Rating Scale (NRS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Following hip arthroscopy, participants with a PENG block will consume less&#xD;
      opioid in the operating and recovery rooms compared with current standard-of-care as measured&#xD;
      in oral morphine milligram equivalents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary end point: In order to claim that PENG blocks are superior to placebo overall, at&#xD;
      least one of these two hypotheses must demonstrate PENG superiority while the other cannot&#xD;
      demonstrate inferiority.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following painful surgical procedures of the hip, postoperative analgesia is often provided&#xD;
      simply with intravenous and oral analgesics. Peripheral nerve blocks using local anesthetic&#xD;
      have been investigated, and while they do provide analgesia, they all carry a high risk of&#xD;
      inducing weakness of the quadriceps and/or hip adductors. This, in turn, results in an&#xD;
      unacceptably high risk of subsequent falls, and peripheral nerve blocks are therefore not&#xD;
      standard-of-care at most health centers. For example, at the University of California San&#xD;
      Diego hospitals, no peripheral nerve block is provided even for the most painful hip surgery,&#xD;
      hip arthroplasty. This results in a strong dependence on opioid analgesics which frequently&#xD;
      provide inadequate analgesia and have undesirable side effects for both individuals and&#xD;
      society. Peripheral nerve blocks with local anesthetic can provide analgesia for over 12&#xD;
      hours without any systemic side effects. Thus, it would be preferable to provide peripheral&#xD;
      nerve blocks to patients having painful hip surgery to reduce pain as well as decrease opioid&#xD;
      use and their associated adverse side effects. Recently, a new type of block has been&#xD;
      reported to provide analgesia to the hip joint: the &quot;pericapsular nerve group&quot; (PENG) block.&#xD;
      Twenty case reports and series have been published suggesting potent analgesia while not&#xD;
      inducing any motor block. However, no randomized, controlled clinical trial is available to&#xD;
      validate the technique and quantify both risks and benefits. The investigators therefore&#xD;
      propose such a study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This investigation will be a randomized, triple-masked, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm,&#xD;
      human subjects clinical trial. Adults undergoing painful unilateral primary hip arthroscopy&#xD;
      with general anesthesia will be offered enrollment. Of note, the investigators will be using&#xD;
      standard-of-care analgesics including oral and intravenous opioids as well as&#xD;
      surgeon-infiltrated local anesthetic directly into the wound under an FDA-approved purpose&#xD;
      and do not plan to research a possible change of indication or use of these medications as&#xD;
      part of this research project. These treatments will be administered in both groups&#xD;
      constituting our institution standard-of-care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following written, informed consent, all participants will have a peripheral intravenous&#xD;
      catheter inserted and standard noninvasive monitors applied. The investigators will evaluate&#xD;
      muscle strength with an isometric force electromechanical dynamometer (MicroFET2, Lafayette&#xD;
      Instrument Company, Lafayette, IN) to measure the force produced during a maximum voluntary&#xD;
      isometric contraction (MVIC) in a seated position with the knees flexed at 90ยบ. For&#xD;
      quadriceps femoris evaluation, the dynamometer will be placed on the ipsilateral anterior&#xD;
      tibia perpendicular to the tibial crest just proximal to the medial malleolus. For hip&#xD;
      adductor evaluation, the femoral shaft will be held at 30ยบ off midline and the dynamometer&#xD;
      placed over the medial femoral epicondyle (adductor tubercle). For all measurements,&#xD;
      participants will be asked to take 2 seconds to come to maximum effort contracting the target&#xD;
      muscle(s), maintain this effort for 5 sec, and then relax. The measurements immediately prior&#xD;
      to perineural ropivacaine administration will be designated baseline measurements, and all&#xD;
      subsequent measurements will be expressed as a percentage of the pre-infusion baseline.&#xD;
      Participants who cannot perform these maneuvers will have their data excluded from the muscle&#xD;
      strength calculations (i.e., a &quot;zero&quot; will not be entered for these participants).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will then be randomized using a computer-generated list to one of two treatment&#xD;
      groups (blocks of 4): a PENG block with 20 mL of either (1) bupivacaine 0.375% or (2) normal&#xD;
      saline [epinephrine added to both]. Investigational pharmacists will create the lists and&#xD;
      fill syringes with one of the two possible study solutions and provide investigators with&#xD;
      syringes that will not identify the treatment. Bupivacaine and normal saline are identical in&#xD;
      appearance, and all investigations, patients, and clinical staff will remain masked to&#xD;
      treatment group. Following enrollment completion, the Investigational Drug Service will&#xD;
      provide the statistician with lists of the treatment groups labeled &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;. Only&#xD;
      following statistical analysis will the specific treatment groups be identified by the&#xD;
      Investigational Drug Service so that the investigators may prepare the manuscript reporting&#xD;
      the results (termed &quot;triple masked&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All blocks will be placed by a regional anesthesia fellow or resident under the direct&#xD;
      supervision and guidance of a regional anesthesia attending (or by the attending themselves).&#xD;
      Participants will have supplemental oxygen administered via a nasal cannula or face mask and&#xD;
      placed in the supine position. Intravenous midazolam and fentanyl will be titrated for&#xD;
      patient comfort, while ensuring that patients remain responsive to verbal cues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blocks technique: A low-frequency curved-array ultrasound transducer will be placed in a&#xD;
      transverse plane over the anterior inferior iliac spine &quot;and then aligned with the pubic&#xD;
      ramus by rotating the probe counterclockwise approximately 45 degrees. In this view the&#xD;
      iliopubic eminence, the iliopsoas muscle and tendon, the femoral artery, and pectineus&#xD;
      muscle&quot; are observed. A 17-gauge needle will be inserted using an in-plane technique directed&#xD;
      medially. The needle tip will be inserted in the musculofascial plane between the psoas&#xD;
      tendon anteriorly and the pubic ramus posteriorly. After gentle negative aspiration, the&#xD;
      study fluid will be slowly injected with frequent aspiration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty to 30 minutes following the initial local anesthetic bolus injection, muscle strength&#xD;
      will be evaluated and recorded in the same manner as the baseline measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperatively, all participants will receive a general anesthetic using inhaled and&#xD;
      intravenous anesthetic and oxygen. Intravenous fentanyl and/or morphine will be administered&#xD;
      for cardiovascular responsiveness to noxious stimuli at the discretion of the anesthesia&#xD;
      provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperatively, participants will be discharged with a prescription for oxycodone 5 mg&#xD;
      tablets for supplementary analgesia and instructed to record the time at which they take&#xD;
      their first opioid tablet as well as the time at which they believe the block starts to wear&#xD;
      off. If a study subject is admitted to the hospital, the investigators will continue to&#xD;
      follow as described herein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measurements. Within the recovery room, pain scores, opioid requirements, and&#xD;
      antiemetic administration will be recorded by nursing staff masked to treatment group&#xD;
      assignment. The morning following surgery, all participants will be contacted by phone or in&#xD;
      person [if hospitalized] to record outcomes. For outpatients, opioid requirements will be&#xD;
      recorded during the call, while inpatients will have opioid requirements extracted from the&#xD;
      electronic medical record. In addition, the investigators will extract antiemetic use from&#xD;
      the electronic record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to claim that PENG blocks are superior to placebo overall, at least one of these two&#xD;
      hypotheses must demonstrate PENG superiority while the other cannot demonstrate inferiority:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Following hip arthroscopy, participants with a PENG block will experience less&#xD;
      pain in the recovery room compared with current standard-of-care as measured with the Numeric&#xD;
      Rating Scale (NRS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Following hip arthroscopy, participants with a PENG block will consume less&#xD;
      opioid in the operating and recovery rooms compared with current standard-of-care as measured&#xD;
      in oral morphine milligram equivalents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary hypotheses are as follows (postoperative day 1 data collection for all):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2.1: Average and worst pain with movement Hypothesis 2.2: Opioid consumption;&#xD;
      average and worst pain at rest Hypothesis 2.3: Awakenings due to pain and difficulty sleeping&#xD;
      due to pain&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary test will be for superiority of bupivacaine over saline. If tests of superiority&#xD;
      fail, exploratory tests for noninferiority will follow with margins specified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline characteristics of the randomized groups will be summarized with means, standard&#xD;
      deviations, and quartiles. Balance between groups will be assessed. Specifically,&#xD;
      standardized differences will be calculated using Cohen's d whereby the difference in means&#xD;
      or proportions is divided by the pooled standard deviation estimates. Any key variables (age,&#xD;
      sex, height, weight, and BMI) with an absolute standardized difference &gt;1.96 x square root of&#xD;
      2/n, where n is the sample size per group will be noted and included in a linear regression&#xD;
      model to obtain an estimate of the treatment group differences adjusted for the imbalanced&#xD;
      covariate(s). If residuals from the linear regression indicate violations of key assumptions&#xD;
      (i.e. homoscedasticity or Gaussian distribution), data transformations and/or alternative&#xD;
      generalized linear models will be applied as appropriate. If all key covariates are found to&#xD;
      be balanced between groups, the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test will be used for primary&#xD;
      inference. Secondary outcomes will also be analyzed by Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test, or linear&#xD;
      models (or generalized linear models) as appropriate to adjust for any imbalanced covariates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Family-wise Error Control. Hypotheses will be tested with strong control of the family-wise&#xD;
      error rate at 5%. Testing begins with equally weighted co-primary hypotheses H11 and H12. If&#xD;
      either of these are significant at the 0.05/2 = 0.025 level, that alpha is passed on to other&#xD;
      hypotheses following the arrows in the figure. For example, if the p-value for H12 is less&#xD;
      than 0.025, but the p-value for H11 is not, then H11 can be tested at the 0.025 + 0.025/2 =&#xD;
      0.0375 level. If both H11 and H12 are rejected, no alpha is spent, and the investigators go&#xD;
      on to similarly test H21a, H21b, H22a, H22b, and H23a, and H23b. If a given test does not&#xD;
      reach local significance, alpha is spent and cannot be passed along to hypotheses further&#xD;
      along the graph.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size justification. Simulated Power for NRS: Simulated Power for NRS. YaDeau et al.&#xD;
      (2012) reports mean +/- standard deviation NRS pain score at rest of 4.2 +/- 1.8 NRS units.&#xD;
      The investigators simulated data from the distribution shown in Figure below, which yields&#xD;
      mean standard deviation of 4.2 +/- 1.8 and 3.0 +/- 1.7. Based on 1,000 simulated trials the&#xD;
      investigators found a sample size of n=50 per group provides 85.7% power with two-sided alpha&#xD;
      =2.5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      YaDeau (2012) reports mean +/- standard deviation NRS pain score with movement (0-10) at 24&#xD;
      hours of 5.5 +/- 2.3 NRS units. The investigators simulated data from the distribution, which&#xD;
      yields mean +/- standard deviation of 5.5 2.6 and 3.9 +/- 2.5. Based on 1,000 simulated&#xD;
      trials the investigators found a sample size of n=50 per group provides 83% power with&#xD;
      two-sided alpha=2.5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simulated Power for opioid consumption. Opioid consumption was assumed to follow a truncated&#xD;
      normal distribution with mean 29 +/- 21 mg (as reported in YaDeau et al. (2012)). A sample&#xD;
      size of n = 50 per group provides about 84% power to detect a treatment difference as small&#xD;
      as 18 mg (mean of 29 mg with normal saline vs 11 mg with bupivacaine) with two-sided alpha =&#xD;
      2.5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators will enroll 50 participants for each of two treatments with&#xD;
      primary end point values for a total enrollment of 100 participants. To allow for dropouts,&#xD;
      the investigators request a maximum enrollment of 120 participants.&#xD;
