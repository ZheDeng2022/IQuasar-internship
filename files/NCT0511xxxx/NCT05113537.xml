    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial tests the safety, side effects, and best dose of abemaciclib and&#xD;
      whether it works before 177Lu-PSMA-617 in treating patients with castration resistant&#xD;
      prostate cancer that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic). Abemaciclib is in a&#xD;
      class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It is highly selective inhibitors of&#xD;
      cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6, which are proteins involved in cell differentiation and&#xD;
      growth. It works by blocking the action of an abnormal protein that signals cancer cells to&#xD;
      multiply. Radioligand therapy uses a small molecule (in this case 177Lu-PSMA-617), which&#xD;
      carries a radioactive component to destroys tumor cells. When 177Lu-PSMA-617 is injected into&#xD;
      the body, it attaches to the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) receptor found on&#xD;
      tumor cells. After 177Lu-PSMA-617 attaches to the PSMA receptor, its radiation component&#xD;
      destroys the tumor cell. Giving abemaciclib before 177Lu-PSMA-617 may help 177Lu-PSMA-617&#xD;
      kill more tumor cells.&#xD;

      treatment prior to lutetium Lu 177 vipivotide tetraxetan (177Lu-PSMA-617) for each treatment&#xD;
      cycle, as well as dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) of this combination regimen. (Part A)&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the change in prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) uptake on gallium Ga&#xD;
      68 gozetotide (68Ga-PSMA-11) positron emission tomography (PET) scan following fourteen days&#xD;
      of priming with abemaciclib treatment, relative to the pre-treatment baseline scan. (Part B&#xD;
      (Expanded Cohort)).&#xD;
&#xD;

      serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) (PSA50) response of this combination treatment. (Part B&#xD;
      [Expanded Cohort]) II. To describe the safety of this combination treatment regimen using&#xD;
      National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)&#xD;
      version (v.)5.0. (Part B [Expanded Cohort]) III. To determine the radiographic progression&#xD;
      free survival (rPFS) according to Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3) guidelines among&#xD;
      patients treated with this combination regimen. (Part B [Expanded Cohort]) IV. To determine&#xD;
      the objective response rate (ORR) (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR]) as&#xD;

      tissue, lymph node and visceral lesions. (Part B [Expanded Cohort]) V. To determine the&#xD;
      disease control rate (DCR) (CR + PR + stable disease (SD)) as measured by RECIST v1.1&#xD;
      response in soft tissue, lymph node and visceral lesions. (Part B [Expanded Cohort]) VI. To&#xD;
      determine the overall survival (OS) of patients treated with this combination regimen. (Part&#xD;

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess changes in tumor microenvironment using ribonucleic acid (RNA) and whole exome&#xD;
      sequencing by comparing biopsies obtained pre and post-combination treatment using the&#xD;
      established institutional biopsy protocol (PROMOTE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess changes in PSMA expression in biopsies at the time of progression relative to&#xD;
      pre-treatment biopsies using immunohistochemistry (IHC).&#xD;

      III. To describe PSMA upregulation on imaging following 7 days of treatment with abemaciclib,&#xD;
      and in particular compare to PSMA upregulation on imaging seen following 14 days of&#xD;
      abemaciclib treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To describe PSMA expression and upregulation on imaging following combined treatment with&#xD;
      abemaciclib and 177Lu-PSMA-617 at the time of subsequent therapy cycles (pre and post&#xD;
      abemaciclib treatment with cycle 3) in some patients treated with RP2D in Part B (expansion&#xD;
      cohort).&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To describe patterns of progression following completion of treatment, including in&#xD;
      patients with available 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To compare response to treatment and clinical outcomes with different dose levels of&#xD;
      abemaciclib used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of abemaciclib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive abemaciclib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14 and lutetium Lu 177&#xD;
      vipivotide tetraxetan intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 15. Treatment repeats every 6&#xD;
      weeks for up to 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study intervention, patients are followed up at 30 days, and then every 3&#xD;
      months for up to 2 years.&#xD;

To be assigned a status of objective response (CR or PR), changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed by repeat scans no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response are first met.

&#xD;
         14. Patients with serious and/or uncontrolled preexisting medical condition(s) that, in&#xD;
             the judgment of the investigator, would preclude participation in this study (for&#xD;
             example, interstitial lung disease, severe dyspnea at rest or requiring oxygen&#xD;
             therapy, severe renal impairment [e.g. estimated creatinine clearance &lt; 30ml/min],&#xD;
             history of major surgical resection involving the stomach or small bowel, or&#xD;
             preexisting Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis or a preexisting chronic condition&#xD;

&#xD;
         15. The patient has active systemic bacterial infection (requiring intravenous (IV)&#xD;
             antibiotics at time of initiating study treatment), fungal infection, or detectable&#xD;
             viral infection (such as known human immunodeficiency virus positivity or with known&#xD;
             active hepatitis B or C (for example, hepatitis B surface antigen positive). Screening&#xD;
             is not required for enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. The patient has a personal history of any of the following conditions: syncope of&#xD;
             cardiovascular etiology, ventricular arrhythmia of pathological origin (including, but&#xD;
             not limited to, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation), or sudden&#xD;
             cardiac arrest.&#xD;
