  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim in this &quot;proof-of-concept&quot; study is to evaluate if a diet concept, based on&#xD;
      foods that have individually been reported to beneficially affect gut microbiota in fact has&#xD;
      an effect on gut microbiota composition and activity among healthy and obese subjects and&#xD;
      whether the effects are associated with altered cardiometabolic risk factors. The aim is&#xD;
      further to investigate if such alterations are reflected in changes of the fecal and plasma&#xD;
      metabolome. In total, 40 men and women, who meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the&#xD;
      exclusion criteria will be invited to participate in the study. The participants will follow&#xD;
      an intervention diet for 6 weeks and a control diet for 6 weeks, with a 6-week wash-out&#xD;
      period in between and will be randomized to either begin with the intervention diet or the&#xD;
      control diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be running over 18 weeks (including a 6-week wash-out period) and it will&#xD;
      include 9 visits at the clinic.&#xD;
