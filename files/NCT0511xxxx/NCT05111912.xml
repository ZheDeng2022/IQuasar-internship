  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      XW003 is an acylated human glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) analogue and is being developed&#xD;
      for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity management.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study treatment period for 4 groups in the study will be divided into the four Titration&#xD;
      Treatment periods and one Core Treatment period. The overall duration of the study treatment&#xD;
      for each group will be 26 weeks. The duration of Titration Treatment will be up to 14 weeks&#xD;
      for the three groups of XW003 treatment but 4 weeks for Saxenda group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 250 participants who are adults with obesity, in the absence of type 2 or any&#xD;
      other type of diabetes, are planned to be screened. Based on a 20% screening failure rate, a&#xD;
      total of 200 participants are expected to be enrolled for the four groups.&#xD;
