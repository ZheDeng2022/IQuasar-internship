  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to compare the effects of mandibular and intraligamentary anesthesia&#xD;
      techniques on pain scores during restorative treatment of permanent mandibular molars in&#xD;
      pediatric patients. Additionally, comparing the anesthesia techniques in terms of injection&#xD;
      pain, the success of anesthesia, postoperative complications, and the subjects' preference&#xD;
      was planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized, controlled, cross-over, single-blind, split-mouth study was conducted on 78&#xD;
      subjects aged 6 to 12 years. Subjects with enamel-dentin caries on the bilateral permanent&#xD;
      mandibular molar were included.&#xD;

      First, the subjects who met the inclusion criteria in the study were included in 2 study&#xD;
      groups according to age, gender, dental experience, DMFT / dmft values, and ICDAS II and&#xD;
      radiographic evaluation criteria. Two different anesthesia techniques were applied to the&#xD;
      right / left permanent first molar teeth of the patients included in the study, with an&#xD;
      interval of one week. The subjects have been divided into two groups as 39 subjects were&#xD;
      Group 1 received intraligamentary anesthesia in the first visit, and 39 subjects were Group 2&#xD;
      received mandibular anesthesia in the first session. The pain perception rates of the&#xD;
      patients during the injection and treatment phases were recorded subjectively using a visual&#xD;
      analog scale and Wong-Baker FACES pain rating scale. Heart rate and arterial oxygen&#xD;
      saturation were determined as the physiological parameters. The quality of anesthesia and&#xD;
      success were evaluated by the operation at the end of each visit. Complications (pain, raised&#xD;
      teeth, hematoma, trauma due to lip/tongue bites, swelling, infection, and bleeding) were&#xD;
      explained to the patients after anesthesia. They were asked to take note of the complications&#xD;
      they encountered. Postoperative complications were recorded by calling the cases 1 day after&#xD;
      the 1st and 2nd visits. At the end of the second visit, anesthesia preference of the patient&#xD;
      was asked and recorded.&#xD;

For the Wong Baker FACES pain rating scale, the maximum value (10) means &quot;it hurt a lot&quot; is the worst and the minimum value (0) means &quot;it does not hurt&quot; is the best outcome. For the Visual Analogue Scale for pain containing Numeric Rating Scale , while the minimum value (0) means &quot;no pain&quot; is the best outcome, the maximum value (10) means &quot;worst possible pain&quot; is the worst outcome.</description>

    <description>Before the restorative treatment of mandibular first molar, SOPIRA® 30 gauge extra-short cartridge needle attached to the tip of the SOPIRA® Citoject (SOPIRA® Heraeus Kulzer, Hanau, Almanya) pressure injector will be inserted into the periodontal sulcus 1-2 mm until resistance. The needle will be at an angle of 30 degrees to the long axis of the tooth. As recommended by the manufacturer, a total of 0.36 ml (mesiobuccal and distobuccal) 4% articaine solution containing 1:100,000 epinephrine (Ultracaine DS forte cartridge, Sanofi-Aventis GmbH, Almanya) will be injected slowly over 42 seconds by pressing the dosing lever 3 times for each root. If the anaesthesia will be failed, we would use the 4-point IL injection by injecting the mesiolingual sulcus and distolingual sulcus with the same technique.</description>

    <description>Before the restorative treatment of mandibular first molar, inferior alveolar nerve block will be provided using the direct standard method. The 27 gauge needle of a 2ml disposable plastic syringe (Ayset, Adana, Turkey) enters from the intersection of the internal oblique edge and the midline of the pterygomandibular raphe, and 1 ml of 4% articaine solution containing1:100,000 epinephrine (Ultracaine DS Forte ampul, Sanofi-Aventis GmbH, Almanya) will be injected slowly in 60 seconds. 15 minutes after the injection the anaesthesia of the lip/tongue will be checked by probing the labial mucosa of the ipsilateral canine tooth.</description>
