  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to determine the impact of a behavior change&#xD;
      intervention that partners Orthodox priests with members of the Health Development Army (HDA)&#xD;
      and train them to conduct newborn health outreach to increase rates of early initiation of&#xD;
      and exclusive breastfeeding through 6 months and vaccination coverage at six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the impact of the intervention on infant growth at six months, observed and&#xD;
           self-reported changes in nutrition and feeding practices of mother and infants, and&#xD;
           early identification of newborn illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Design a culturally relevant, scalable intervention for community-based newborn and&#xD;
           infant health in Gondar in partnership with local partners, the Federal Ministry of&#xD;
           Health, and the Gondar Regional Health Bureau.&#xD;

      The study will test a model the leverages existing community networks to improve the health&#xD;
      of newborns in Gondar, Ethiopia. The intervention will be implemented at the community level&#xD;
      by pairs of trained Ethiopian Orthodox priests and members of the Heath Development Army&#xD;
      (HDA). A list of priests serving at the EOC churches in the intervention arm will be obtained&#xD;
      through the woreda diocese and their respective churches. All the priests will be contacted&#xD;
      through the church leadership and asked to participate in the study intervention. The&#xD;
      intervention will be implemented in collaboration with HDA members recruited by HEWs under&#xD;
      the health centers in the catchment areas of the intervention churches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An initial 5 day training will be given to priests and HDA members. The training will focus&#xD;
      on newborn health topics including early initiation of and exclusive breastfeeding, maternal&#xD;
      nutrition, immunization, childhood illnesses, child health care services, etc. At the end of&#xD;
      the training action plans will be prepared by the training organizers, priests, and HDA.&#xD;
      Priest will be asked to integrate health messages and education into their routine family&#xD;
      visits around the birth of a child in structured intervals as culturally appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trained priests and HDA members will be dispatched to their respective communities to&#xD;
      begin the intervention. Their primary activities will be identification of near-term pregnant&#xD;
      and newly delivered women, providing health education to their families, follow-up visits to&#xD;
      enable newborn-mother pairs to access child health care services, and to provide health&#xD;
      education at religious and community gatherings. Specifically, pre-planned visits of&#xD;
      parishioners' families will be done by the respective priests and the partnering HDA members&#xD;
      during the last month of pregnancy, immediately after the delivery of the baby and around the&#xD;
      time of baptism for the newborn. These visits will be used to educate pregnant and postpartum&#xD;
      women and their families on newborn health topics including initiation of breastfeeding,&#xD;
      duration of breastfeeding/ exclusive breastfeeding, vaccination, cord care, and utilization&#xD;
      of available newborn health care services. These community based activities will be monitored&#xD;
      through regular follow-up visits by the UoG study team and discussions with priests and HDA&#xD;
      members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Newborn-mother pairs will be recruited within the first 10 days after delivery as reported to&#xD;
      the study team by Health Extension Workers (HEWs) engaged in the study. Recruitment will&#xD;
      start one month following the start of the intervention and all reported newborn-mother pairs&#xD;
      who meet the screening criteria will be included in the study until the calculated sample&#xD;
      sizes are reached. HEW's routine registers of new deliveries will be used to trace, recruit&#xD;
      and screen study participants. Newborn-mother pairs who fulfill an initial screening criteria&#xD;
      will be reported to the study team at the University of Gondar (UoG) who will travel to the&#xD;
      study site regularly for recruitment of study participants and data collection.&#xD;
      Newborn-mother pairs will be reported to the UoG study team both through phone calls made by&#xD;
      HEWs and in-person at the time of regular onsite visits by the team.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Eligible newborn-mother pairs will be visited by a member of the study team at their home or&#xD;
      at an appointed meeting location in their community to complete the verbal informed consent&#xD;
      process. Those pairs who attend church at a parish that received the intervention will be&#xD;
      assigned to the intervention arm, and those from the parishes where no intervention was&#xD;
      conducted will be assigned to the control arm. Initial baseline data will then be collected&#xD;
      and follow-up visit schedules arranged with the study team.&#xD;
