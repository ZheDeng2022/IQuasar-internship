      This study developed the first prediction model for risk of critical ITP bleeds for ITP&#xD;
      inpatients using a novel machine learning algorithm. This model has been implemented as a&#xD;
      web-based model so that clinicians can obtain the estimated probability of critical ITP&#xD;
      bleeds for ITP inpatients. The objective of this study is to prospectively and externally&#xD;
      validate the risk of critical ITP bleeds in newly admitted ITP patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a common acquired autoimmune disease characterized&#xD;
      by reduced platelet production and increased platelet destruction due to autoimmune&#xD;
      disorders, as patients present with low platelet counts and a high risk of bleeding. Although&#xD;
      most ITP patients present a good prognosis, the rare but important critical ITP bleeds events&#xD;
      are the threatening-life complication to ITP patients, severely affecting their prognosis,&#xD;
      quality of life and treatment decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently, the development of clinical prediction models has provided powerful tools for&#xD;
      precision diagnosis and early intervention of diseases, especially the application of machine&#xD;
      learning methods. Machine learning approaches can overcome some of the limitations of current&#xD;
      risk prediction analysis methods by applying computer algorithms to large data sets with&#xD;
      numerous multidimensional variables, capturing the high-dimensional nonlinear relationships&#xD;
      between clinical features to produce data, drive outcome prediction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It suggests an unmet need for personalized patient management strategies and an urgent need&#xD;
      for effective tools to predict the risk of critical ITP bleeds in hospitalized patients in&#xD;
      medical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here, we aim to integrate clinical and laboratory data based on a nationwide multicenter&#xD;
      study in China to build a clinical prediction model. In particular, we also perform external&#xD;
      and prospective validation with large sample sizes to improve the robustness and utility of&#xD;
      our models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a simple and convenient tool to quickly assess newly admitted ITP patients and achieve&#xD;
      early identification and intervention for those at high risk of life-threatening bleeding&#xD;
      events, thus reducing disability and mortality rates in the future.&#xD;
