  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Limited large-scale studies have been conducted to investigate the adverse effects of&#xD;
      COVID-19 vaccine in Latin America, particularly among the healthcare worker (HCW) population&#xD;
      in Ecuador. The objective of this study was to assess a cohort of Ecuadorian healthcare&#xD;
      workers for adverse reactions following vaccination with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic bears a burden on medical care and economies worldwide, however&#xD;
      immunization at the population level provides a way for to reduce future morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. Vaccine hesitancy and reluctance in getting the COVID-19 vaccine and apprehensions&#xD;
      about them have been present along the course of vaccination programs and mass immunizations&#xD;
      across the world. Factors such as the quick, large-scale production of vaccines, lack of&#xD;
      information, and uncertainty about adverse reactions in the public's eye as well about myths&#xD;
      spreading through media channels have given rise to suspicion and fear in the Latin American&#xD;
      population. Limited large-scale studies have been conducted to investigate the adverse&#xD;
      effects of COVID-19 vaccine in Latin America, particularly among the healthcare worker (HCW)&#xD;
      population in Ecuador. The objective of this study was to assess a cohort of Ecuadorian&#xD;
      healthcare workers for adverse reactions following vaccination with the Pfizer-BioNTech&#xD;
      vaccine.&#xD;
