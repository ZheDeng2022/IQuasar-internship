  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the effect of a plant-based oral nutrition supplement, Kate Farms&#xD;
      Standard 1.4 and/or Standard 1.0. as a primary source of nutrition in reducing the&#xD;
      gastrostomy tube placement rate in patients with head and neck cancer that has spread to&#xD;
      nearby tissue or lymph nodes (locally advanced) and who are undergoing chemoradiation&#xD;
      therapy. Gastrostomy tube (G-tube) placement can be used for enteral feedings and may lead to&#xD;
      long term side effects such as swallowing dysfunction and lead to higher rates of permanent&#xD;
      G-tube dependence. The Kate Farms pea protein oral nutrition supplement is formulated with&#xD;
      organic, planted-based protein for easier digestibility without artificial sweeteners or&#xD;
      additives and without common allergens such as dairy, soy, gluten or corn. It is&#xD;
      nutritionally complete, calorie and protein dense and available in multiple flavors that can&#xD;
      be consumed directly or as a base for other recipes. Giving pea protein oral nutrition&#xD;
      supplement may provide nutritional support to decrease the need for therapeutic G-tube rate&#xD;
      during chemoradiation compared to standard supportive care.&#xD;

      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive Kate Farms pea protein oral nutrition supplement orally (PO) during their&#xD;
      mealtimes as directed by their clinical dietitian during and up to 1 month following&#xD;
      chemoradiation in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study intervention, patients are followed up for a minimum of 2 years.&#xD;
