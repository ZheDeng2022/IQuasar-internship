      The SHIELD (Screening for High Frequency Malignant Disease) study is a prospective,&#xD;
      observational, multi-site basket design trial without randomization. The primary objective of&#xD;
      the study is to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of a blood-based GuardantLUNAR-2&#xD;
      test to detect high frequency cancer in screen-relevant populations.&#xD;

      The SHIELD (Screening for High Frequency Malignant Disease) study is a prospective,&#xD;
      observational, multi-site basket design trial without randomization. The primary objective of&#xD;
      the study is to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of a blood-based GuardantLUNAR-2&#xD;
      test to detect high frequency cancer in screen-relevant populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SHIELD study will recruit patients in separate cancer-risk cohorts with specified&#xD;
      pathways for cancer screening. Patients eligible for high frequency cancer screening will be&#xD;
      screened for study eligibility per each cohort's criteria (see appendixes). Within each&#xD;
      cohort, individuals eligible for the study will be consented for the investigational blood&#xD;
      draw and applicable questionnaires within 90 days of standard of care screening method and&#xD;
      prior to any invasive procedure for cancer diagnosis and/or treatment (T0). Subjects will&#xD;
      have at least 2 follow-up visits at 1 year and 2 years (T1 and T2) since the index blood draw&#xD;
      during the study. Additional follow-up is defined per each cohort. Updated medical data,&#xD;
      repeat investigational blood draw and study questionnaires will be collected at follow-up&#xD;
      intervals per each cohort's study procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first cohort to be recruited will be designated as cohort A for lung cancer screening&#xD;
      (appendix 1). Additional baskets with other cancer-risk cohorts of interest will be&#xD;
      considered and added as the study expands. Additional appendixes will be designed for these&#xD;
      cohorts at that time.&#xD;
