    <textblock>
      The spectrum of pathologies accompanied by tissue mineral deposits is wide. In dermatology,&#xD;
      several pathologies are associated with calcium mineral deposits, such as calciphylaxis and&#xD;
      pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE). However, few studies have been carried out on the chemical&#xD;
      characteristics of these deposits, their implication on the pathophysiology and their&#xD;
      consequences. This motivated our two previous studies on the characterization of skin mineral&#xD;
      deposits during calciphylaxis and sarcoidosis. We have shown that these deposits were most&#xD;
      often composed of carbapatite and preferentially localized to elastic fibers. Most calcifying&#xD;
      dermatoses are preceded by an inflammatory skin condition. Some authors suspect the digestion&#xD;
      of elastin by metalloproteinase (MMP) of the extracellular matrix, thus creating nucleation&#xD;
      nuclei favoring phosphocalcic deposits. We thus wish to study the structural alteration of&#xD;
      dermal elastic fibers during calcifying dermatoses using multiphoton microscopy, a tool&#xD;
      available at the Laboratoire d'Optique et Biosciences (LOB) at the Ecole Polytechnique.&#xD;
      Multiphoton microscopy presents several contrast modes that can be used in parallel and&#xD;
      without marking. This makes it possible to identify constituent elements of tissues without&#xD;
      the use of artificially added fluorescent dyes or proteins, for example fibrillar collagen by&#xD;
      the so-called &quot;SHG&quot; contrast and elastin by its intrinsic fluorescence. It is then possible&#xD;
      to deeply image an intact tissue, without staining, by specifically visualizing its various&#xD;
      components. Used in several studies on the skin, including the LOB, multiphoton microscopy&#xD;
      has shown its interest in the characterization of dermal fibers, in particular elastin and&#xD;
      collagen fibers, but also in the structural study of these and of their possible alteration.&#xD;
      It has thus been applied to the study of skin aging, but also of pathologies leading to&#xD;
      degeneration of elastic fibers (PXE) or collagen (Marfan syndrome). The main objective of our&#xD;
      project is to characterize the structural alterations of elastic fibers during calcifying&#xD;
      dermatoses. The secondary objectives are to study the consequences of skin inflammatory&#xD;
      phenomena on the deterioration of elastic fibers and to identify a possible nucleus of&#xD;
      phospho-calcium deposits within elastic dermal and vascular fibers. We will thus study human&#xD;
      skin biopsies already carried out in the context of the diagnosis of these calcifying&#xD;
      dermatoses, skin biopsies from the murine model of PXE and in control, human biopsies of&#xD;
      healthy skin from patients of different ages (excision margin of skin tumors). This project&#xD;
      should provide a better understanding of the genesis of skin phosphocalcic deposits and&#xD;
      provide therapeutic avenues for treating them and limiting their occurrence.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The variety of pathologies accompanied by mineral deposits in tissues is large (cancers,&#xD;
      infectious processes, environmental diseases) (1). In dermatology, several pathologies are&#xD;
      associated with calcium mineral deposits, such as calciphylaxis and pseudoxanthoma elasticum&#xD;
      (PXE). To date, few studies have been carried out on the chemical characteristics of&#xD;
      cutaneous mineral deposits, their physiopathological consequences, the occurrence of&#xD;
      associated pathologies and their repercussions on human organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This has motivated the PhD project of Hester COLBOC, M.D., on the characterization of calcium&#xD;
      deposits in various calcifying dermatosis, including calciphylaxis (2) and sarcoidosis (3).&#xD;
      This fundamental research project is carried out in the framework of a collaboration between&#xD;
      the LCP (Institute of Physico-Chemistry, CNRS, Paris-Saclay University) and AP-HP, in&#xD;
      particular in the fields of uro-nephrology (urinary lithiasis) and oncology (4)&#xD;
      (calcifications in breast and thyroid cancer). We have shown that skin calcifications consist&#xD;
      of carbapatite in calciphylaxis and calcite in sarcoidosis. We have also shown that these&#xD;
      deposits are mainly located in the dermal or vessel wall elastic fibres, suggesting a&#xD;
      molecular nucleation pathway within these fibers to be explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This structural and chemical description is innovative, but does not answer all the questions&#xD;
      that arise around these calcium deposits: why do some patients, who present a normal&#xD;
      phosphocalcium balance, have massive skin calcifications? Why, on the contrary, do other&#xD;
      patients, such as some dialysis patients, present extremely disturbed phosphocalcic balance&#xD;
      sheets, but no skin calcification? This paradox raises the possibility of the existence of&#xD;
      &quot;nucleation foci&quot; within the elastic dermal and vascular fibers, favouring the precipitation&#xD;
      of phosphocalcic deposits in some patients. Some in vitro models have explored these&#xD;
      nucleation foci within elastic fibres. (ref Gourgas et al) Quite remarkably, most calcifying&#xD;
      dermatosis are preceded by a cutaneous inflammatory state. These skin inflammatory phenomena&#xD;
      could also induce the precipitation of calcium deposits. Some authors thus speculate that&#xD;
      elastin is digested by metalloproteinase (MMP) in the extracellular matrix, thus creating&#xD;
      nucleation foci favouring phosphocalcic deposits. Munavalli et al. showed an increase level&#xD;
      of MMP in urinary sample of a patient with calciphylaxis in a context of rapid weight loss&#xD;
      (5). They hypothesize that elevated serum MMP levels in this patient could lead to an&#xD;
      alteration of the external elastic limit and vascular calcifications. This hypothesis is&#xD;
      supported on the other hand by other models of elastic fiber alteration, such as during skin&#xD;
      aging (dermatoporosis), in which there is no inflammation and no calcification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The background hypothesis of our project is that skin inflammation leads to a specific&#xD;
      alteration of the elastic fibres, which is conducive to their calcification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to explore this hypothesis, particularly during calciphylaxis and PXE, we propose to&#xD;
      use multiphoton microscopy, an imaging technique available at the Laboratoire d'Optique et&#xD;
      Biosciences (LOB) at the Ecole Polytechnique. Multiphoton microscopy has been developed in&#xD;
      the early 1990s as an alternative to confocal microscopy, to improve in-depth imaging of&#xD;
      biological tissues with sub-micrometric resolution. Most importantly, multiphoton microscopy&#xD;
      can combine several lodes of contrast in parallel and without any labeling to identify the&#xD;
      various elements of a tissue. Second harmonic generation (SHG) signals allow specific imaging&#xD;
      of unstained fibrillar collagen with unequalled sensitivity, while two-photon excited&#xD;
      fluorescence (2PEF) allows cellular imaging thanks to various intrinsic cellular chromophores&#xD;
      as well as elastin imaging in the dermis or in other tissues (see Figure 1) (6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiphoton microscopy has been used in several studies on the skin, including at LOB (see&#xD;
      Figure 1), which have proven the high relevance of this technique for the structural&#xD;
      characterization of dermal fibers, particularly elastin and collagen fibers, and their&#xD;
      possible alteration. It has been applied to the study of skin ageing, as well as to&#xD;
      pathologies leading to degeneration of elastic (PXE) or collagen fibres (Marfan Syndrome)&#xD;
      (7-9). This technique is therefore highly appropriate for exploring the structure of elastic&#xD;
      fibres during cutaneous inflammatory phenomena and calcifying dermatoses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In parallel, the cutaneous inflammatory process will be explored by other methods.&#xD;
      Immuno-histochemistry will be used to detect dermal MMP and X-ray fluorescence (at&#xD;
      Synchrotron Soleil, Diffabs line) will be used to evidence intradermal zinc and other&#xD;
      metallic deposits, as done in our previous studies (Figure 2).&#xD;

      Figure 2: X-ray fluorescence of a skin biopsy: example of correlation between dermal&#xD;
      inflammatory infiltrate (A) and the presence of intradermal Zinc (B), here during a lichenoid&#xD;
      reaction on tattoo (images recorded at the Soleil Synchrotron, Diffabs line, by S. Reguer, D.&#xD;
      Bazin and H. Colboc).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of our project is to characterize the structural alterations of elastic&#xD;
      fibers during calcifying dermatosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to study the consequences of cutaneous inflammatory processes on the alteration of&#xD;
           elastic fibers,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to identify a possible nucleation foci for the formation of phospho-calcium deposits&#xD;
           within the elastic dermal and vascular fibers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin samples. The study will be mainly performed on human skin, but also on a mouse model of&#xD;
      PXE: ABCC6 KO mouse. More precisely, the material studied at LOB will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Human skin biopsies already collected for the diagnosis of these calcifying dermatoses:&#xD;
           PXE, calciphylaxis, other calcifying inflammatory dermatoses (lupus panniculitis,&#xD;
           dermatomyositis), from the pathology laboratory of the Tenon hospital (Dr Moguelet).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  As controls, human biopsies of healthy skin from patients of different ages, (margin of&#xD;
           skin tumour removal), from the Tenon Hospital. We will focuse on patient with advanced&#xD;
           skin aging, especially patients with solar elastosis. This model of UV induced elastic&#xD;
           fibers alteration is a great control in term of non-inflammatory and non-calcified&#xD;
           elastic fibers damages.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cutaneous biopsies from the mouse model of PXE (ABCC6 KO mouse) and from matched control&#xD;
           mice, from INSERM Unit 1155, Tenon Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocols. All these biopsies will be characterized by multiphoton microscopy by combining&#xD;
      2PEF and SHG contrasts in order to simultaneously image elastic and collagen fibers. In a&#xD;
      first step, the experimental protocol will be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Production at Tenon Hospital of several serial slides from each biopsy: 1 unstained&#xD;
           (&quot;white&quot;) slide for multiphoton imaging, 1 slide with usual morphological staining&#xD;
           (hematoxylin-eosin-safran, HES), 1 slide with staining highlighting calcium deposits&#xD;
           (Von Kossa) and 3 slides with immuno-histochemical labelings of the main MMPs&#xD;
           (antibodies against MMP-1, 2 and 9).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  imaging at LOB on a standard brightfield optical microscope (standard and polarized&#xD;
           transmitted light, fluorescence, DIC) of all the stained slides over a large field of&#xD;
           view by mosaicking; identification of regions of interest (ROI) corresponding to&#xD;
           inflammatory processes, tissue remodeling or mineral deposits. Note that mineral&#xD;
           deposits are revealed by polarized transmitted light or by phase contrast or DIC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  X-ray fluorescence imaging at Soleil Synchrotron to identify the metallic deposits&#xD;
           present in the biopsies, specially Zinc. This will be done in collaboration with&#xD;
           Dominique Bazin (Institute of Physico-Chemistry, CNRS, Paris-Saclay University), which&#xD;
           has a strong expertise in mineral imaging in the Diffabs line.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multiphoton imaging at LOB of the identified regions of interest, or even on a large&#xD;
           field of view by automatically stitching several tiles. Polarization-resolved images&#xD;
           will also be carried out in very dense areas or in remodeled areas in order to map the&#xD;
           direction of collagen and elastin fibers (10).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Automated quantitative analysis of multiphoton LOB images to measure several parameters&#xD;
           related to the quantity and structure of elastin. Automated quantitative analyses will&#xD;
           also be performed on collagen and other structures of interest observed on multiphoton&#xD;
           images or histological images. The results of the different imaging modalities will be&#xD;
           correlated on each series of slides. Note that automatic analysis is essential both to&#xD;
           avoid the usual biases of semi-quantitative analysis and to obtain more informative&#xD;
           structural parameters. For instance, the following parameters will be extracted from the&#xD;
           elastin images: the mean density of the elastic fibers (per cm², in the papillary dermis&#xD;
           and in the reticular dermis), the orientation distribution of the elastic fibers, the&#xD;
           entropy and the circular variance of this distribution, the degree of curvature of the&#xD;
           elastic fibers, their distance from the mineral deposits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Statistical analysis of multimodal data, based on appropriate statistical tests. A&#xD;
           priori non-parametric tests (Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney) will be used in view of the&#xD;
           relatively small number of available human samples. A minimum of 8 patients per group&#xD;
           will be studied, which should be sufficient due to the accuracy and reproducibility of&#xD;
           the automated measurements. If several samples or image series are performed on the same&#xD;
           patient, nested statistical tests will be used (nested t-tests or nested Wilcoxon).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a second step and based on the results of the first step, various items of this protocol&#xD;
      will be improved to access more information:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multiphoton imaging will be performed in intact murine skin biopsies to better highlight&#xD;
           the 3D organization of elastin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Advanced fluorescence imaging of inflammation will be performed in ex vivo murine skin,&#xD;
           using spectral or FLIM (fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy) measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Third Harmonic Generation (THG) will be used to visualize the structure of the mineral&#xD;
           deposits.&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Statistical analysis of multimodal data, based on appropriate statistical tests. A&#xD;
           priori non-parametric tests (Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney) will be used in view of the&#xD;
           relatively small number of available human samples. A minimum of 8 patients per group&#xD;
           will be studied, which should be sufficient due to the accuracy and reproducibility of&#xD;
           the automated measurements. If several samples or image series are performed on the same&#xD;
           patient, nested statistical tests will be used (nested t-tests or nested Wilcoxon).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a second step and based on the results of the first step, various items of this protocol&#xD;
      will be improved to access more information:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multiphoton imaging will be performed in intact murine skin biopsies to better highlight&#xD;
           the 3D organization of elastin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Advanced fluorescence imaging of inflammation will be performed in ex vivo murine skin,&#xD;
           using spectral or FLIM (fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy) measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Third Harmonic Generation (THG) will be used to visualize the structure of the mineral&#xD;
           deposits.&#xD;
