  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, multicenter, open-label, single arm study evaluating the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of trilaciclib administered prior to sacituzumab govitecan-hziy in patients with&#xD;
      unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) who&#xD;
      received at least 2 prior treatments, at least 1 in the metastatic setting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will include 3 study phases: Screening Phase, Treatment Phase, and Survival&#xD;
      Follow-up Phase. The Treatment Phase begins on the day of the first dose of study treatment&#xD;
      and completes at the Safety Follow-up Visit. Trilaciclib and sacituzumab govitecan-hziy will&#xD;
      be administered intravenously (IV) in 21-day cycles. Study drug administration will continue&#xD;
      until progressive disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 or&#xD;
      clinical progression as determined by the Investigator, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of&#xD;
      consent, Investigator decision, or the end of the study, whichever occurs first. The first&#xD;
      Survival Follow-up assessment should occur approximately 3 months after the Safety Follow-Up&#xD;
      Visit and will continue every 3 months until the end of the study (or death).&#xD;
