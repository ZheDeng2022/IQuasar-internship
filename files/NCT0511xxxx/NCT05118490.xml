    <textblock>
      A multicenter, randomized, stratified, open-label, phase IV trial among HIV-positive persons&#xD;
      (PLHIV) on antiretroviral therapy (ART), or HIV-negative household contacts of patients with&#xD;
      rifampicin-sensitive pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), who do not have evidence of active TB.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be stratified by indication for tuberculosis (TB) preventive treatment&#xD;
      (TPT) - HIV seropositive persons or HIV-negative household contact of person with infectious&#xD;
      TB - and will receive either one of two TB preventive therapy regimens:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: People living with HIV infection without active TB&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A: isoniazid (300mg) and rifapentine (600mg) daily for 4 weeks (1HP)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm B: isoniazid (900mg) and rifapentine (900mg) weekly for 12 weeks (3HP)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A (n=250): 250 participants age ≥13 years of age who are HIV seropositive and taking ART&#xD;
      who do not have evidence of active TB will be recruited from local clinics. After being&#xD;
      consented, screened, and randomized, participants in Arm A will receive the 1HP regimen once&#xD;
      daily for 4 weeks (28 doses).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study events include a health history, physical exam, TB symptom screen, symptom screen for&#xD;
      adverse events (AEs), adherence checks during 1HP, and clinic visits at months 1, 2, and 6,&#xD;
      at the least. Safety labs for liver function will be checked as clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm B (n=250): 250 participants age ≥13 years of age who are HIV seropositive and taking ART&#xD;
      who do not have evidence of active TB will be recruited from local clinics. After being&#xD;
      consented, screened, and randomized, participants in Arm B will receive the 3HP regimen once&#xD;
      weekly for 12 weeks (12 doses).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study events include a health history, physical exam, TB symptom screen, symptom screen for&#xD;
      adverse events (AEs), adherence checks during 3HP, and clinic visits at months 1, 2, 3, and&#xD;
      6, at the least. Safety labs for liver function will be checked as clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: HIV-negative household contacts of newly diagnosed adults with rifampicin-sensitive&#xD;
      pulmonary TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A: isoniazid (300mg) and rifapentine (600mg) daily for 4 weeks (1HP)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm B: isoniazid (900mg) and rifapentine (900mg) weekly for 12 weeks (3HP)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A (n=250): 250 participants age ≥13 years of age who are HIV-negative household contacts&#xD;
      of adults with rifampicin-sensitive pulmonary TB who do not have evidence of active TB will&#xD;
      be recruited from local clinics and households of active cases. After being consented,&#xD;
      screened, and randomized, participants in Arm A will receive the 1HP regimen once daily for 4&#xD;
      weeks (28 doses).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study events include a health history, physical exam, TB symptom screen, symptom screen for&#xD;
      adverse events (AEs), adherence checks during 1HP, and clinic visits at months 1, 2, and 6,&#xD;
      at the least. Safety labs for liver function will be checked as clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm B (n=250): 250 participants age ≥13 years of age who are HIV-negative household contacts&#xD;
      of adults with rifampicin-sensitive pulmonary TB who do not have evidence of active TB will&#xD;
      be recruited from local clinics and households of active cases. After being consented,&#xD;
      screened, and randomized, participants in Arm B will receive the 3HP regimen once weekly for&#xD;
      12 weeks (12 doses).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study events include a health history, physical exam, TB symptom screen, symptom screen for&#xD;
      adverse events (AEs), adherence checks during 3HP, and clinic visits at months 1, 2, 3, and&#xD;
