  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety and depression have far-reaching&#xD;
      potential to overcome common barriers to accessing evidence-based treatment, such as waiting&#xD;
      lists, travel distance and costs. Despite the undeniable promise of iCBT, several aspects&#xD;
      remain poorly understood and warrants further study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The INTERMENTAL project is a joint effort between Norwegian Institute of Public Health,&#xD;
      Norwegian Directorate of Health and six Prompt Mental Health Care (PMHC) services, situated&#xD;
      in 11 municipalities, to evaluate the iCBT interventions developed by the technology company&#xD;
      &quot;Assistert Selvhjelp&quot; (AS-iCBT). We will conduct a large-scale hybrid&#xD;
      effectiveness-implementation randomized controlled non-inferiority trial that will provide&#xD;
      new knowledge on the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and implementation of AS-iCBT and&#xD;
      blended CBT in primary care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: Examine the non-inferiority of guided internet-based cognitive behavioural&#xD;
      treatment &quot;Assistert Selvhjelp&quot; (AS-iCBT) and blended CBT (bCBT) compared to face-to-face&#xD;
      (F2F)-CBT for anxiety and depression in primary care with regard to effects on symptoms of&#xD;
      anxiety and depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives: (i) Examine the non-inferiority of AS-iCBT and bCBT compared to F2F-CBT&#xD;
      on other outcomes such as quality of life, functional level, specific anxiety measures&#xD;
      (social anxiety, panic disorder), sleep and employment status; (ii) Examine the&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of AS-iCBT and bCBT compared to F2F-CBT; (iii) Examine to what extent&#xD;
      moderators and mediators of change are associated with treatment effectiveness of AS-iCBT and&#xD;
      bCBT; (iv) Assess whether AS-iCBT and bCBT are as acceptable and appropriate for treatment of&#xD;
      anxiety and depression as F2F-CBT, and examine barriers/facilitators for their further&#xD;
      implementation.&#xD;

    <description>Changes in mean levels of physical activity at 6-, 12-, 18-, and 24-months follow-up. Physical activity will be assessed using three sets of questions, assessing the average number of times exercising each week, and the average intensity and average hours each time. This 3-item questionnaire has previously been used in the large population-based Nord-Trøndelag Health Study (the HUNT studies). A physical activity index will be derived in line with the work from Kurtze et al. (2008). Scores from 0 to 15. Lower scores indicate worse outcome.</description>

    <description>Changes in mean levels of sedentary behaviour (SB) at 6-, 12-, 18-, and 24-months follow-up. Sedentary behaviour was assessed using two questions assessing the average number of hours of sedentary behaviour during the last two weeks. The first questions covers sedentary behaviour during weekdays, whereas the second question covers sedentary behaviour during the weekend. A weighted sum score of these items is used to derive an index for SB. The items are based on the single item on SB in the short form of the international physical activity questionnaire (IPAQ-SF). Scores from 0 to 5. Higher scores indicate worse outcome.</description>

    <description>AS-iCBT offers guided CBT intervention for anxiety and depression, each consisting of 6 modules. It is recommended for clients to complete 1 module weekly. The structure and content of the programme modules follow evidence-based CBT principles, and comprises cognitive and behavioural components such as self-monitoring, gradual stimulus control, exposure, behavioural activation, and cognitive restructuring. It is recommended that therapist support is provided weekly during short sessions that focus on progress monitoring and feedback on completed work. Support sessions should last 15-20 minutes and are preferably delivered by phone or video conference.</description>

    <description>F2F-CBT typically consists of 2-15 sessions with a therapist, each session lasting 45-60 minutes. The median number of treatment sessions for F2F-CBT in PMHC was previously estimated to be around 6.</description>

    <description>bCBT includes both low-intensity (iCBT, group-based psychoeducation) and high-intensity CBT (F2F-CBT). The bCBT condition basically represents how PMHC services currently operates (i.e. a pragmatic stepped care model) and provides therapists with more flexibility to accommodate client needs and preferences.</description>
