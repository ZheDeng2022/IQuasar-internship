  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease (CKD) results from the progressive and irreversible destruction of the&#xD;
      kidneys. As of December 31, 2018, there were 89,692 people in France undergoing replacement&#xD;
      therapy, including 49,271 (55%) on dialysis and 40,421 (45%) with a functioning kidney&#xD;
      transplant. The primary treatment modality is currently hemodialysis. It is known to activate&#xD;
      the coagulation cascade and blood platelets, leading to thrombus formation and premature&#xD;
      termination of the hemodialysis session. This loss of circuitry results in a decrease in&#xD;
      session time leading to an insufficient dialysis dose and blood loss in patients who are&#xD;
      already often anemic due to their chronic renal failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To avoid this complication, current recommendations recommend the use of unfractionated&#xD;
      heparin (UFH) or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) during the hemodialysis session at the&#xD;
      cost of an obligatory hemorrhagic risk due to the systemic administration of heparin.&#xD;
      However, this risk of bleeding is already very high, due to platelet dysfunction, a direct&#xD;
      consequence of uremic toxin impregnation in these patients. In addition, this hemodialysis&#xD;
      population is frequently exposed to antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants (heparin or VKA),&#xD;
      which aggravate the hemorrhagic risk inherent to renal pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, bioactive membranes such as the HeprAN™ membrane, coated in heparin, have&#xD;
      been developed to minimize or even eliminate the need for anticoagulation during sessions in&#xD;
      chronic hemodialysis patients. Several studies with this membrane have demonstrated the&#xD;
      absence of the need for additional heparin in populations with no particular bleeding risk&#xD;
      and in populations at risk of bleeding: post-operative (HepZero study), patients on VKA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HYDROLINK™ membrane offers the same anticoagulant prospects as the HeprAN™ membrane, but&#xD;
      its mode of action involves the use of a copolymer with hydrophilic properties, making it&#xD;
      possible to avoid the presence of heparin. This membrane would have an influence on platelet&#xD;
      aggregation. It would also make it possible to avoid the risk of heparin-induced&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia (HIT) by completely excluding heparin from the dialysis session&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the HYDROLINK™ membrane to the HeprAN™ membrane in a&#xD;
      large-scale trial with the strategy of minimizing the dose of peridialytic heparin in order&#xD;
      to reduce the risk of bleeding in chronic hemodialysis patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in the research will be offered at the time of a hemodialysis session to any&#xD;
      eligible patient, i.e., over 18 years of age, who has been on chronic hemodialysis for at&#xD;
      least 3 months at a rate of three times a week and who has given their consent to this study.&#xD;
      A cross over trial will be performed. Each included patient will have hemodialysis sessions&#xD;
      with HYDROLINK™ and HeprAN™ membrane.&#xD;
