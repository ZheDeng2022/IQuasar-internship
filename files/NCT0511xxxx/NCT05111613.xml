        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must meet each of the following criteria to be included in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Echo, computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA), or pulmonary angiographic&#xD;
             evidence of any proximal filling defect in at least one main or lobar pulmonary artery&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Classification of intermediate-high-risk PE by ESC Guidelines 2019, including ALL of&#xD;
             the following: clinical signs and symptoms consistent with acute PE, or PESI class&#xD;
             III-V, or sPESI ≥1; AND hemodynamically stable; AND RV dysfunction on echocardiography&#xD;
             or CT; AND elevated cardiac troponin levels&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intervention planned to begin within 72 hours of the later of either: confirmed PE&#xD;
             diagnosis; OR if transferring from another hospital, arrival at the treating hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Symptom onset within 14 days of confirmed PE diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will be excluded from the study for any of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unable to anticoagulate with heparin, enoxaparin or other parenteral antithrombin&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Index presentation with hemodynamic instability that are part of the high-risk PE&#xD;
             definition in the ESC Guidelines 2019, including ANY of the following: cardiac arrest;&#xD;
             OR systolic BP &lt; 90 mmHg or vasopressors required to achieve a BP ≥90 mmHg despite&#xD;
             adequate filling status, AND end-organ hypoperfusion; OR systolic BP &lt; 90 mmHg or&#xD;
             systolic BP drop ≥40 mmHg, lasting longer than 15 min and not caused by new-onset&#xD;
             arrhythmia, hypovolemia, or sepsis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known sensitivity to radiographic contrast agents that, in the Investigator's opinion,&#xD;
             cannot be adequately pre-treated&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Imaging evidence or other evidence that suggests, in the opinion of the Investigator,&#xD;
             the patient is not appropriate for catheter-based intervention (e.g. inability to&#xD;
             navigate to target location, clot limited to segmental/subsegmental distribution,&#xD;
             predominately chronic clot)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has right heart clot in transit identified at baseline screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy &lt; 30 days (e.g. stage 4 cancer or severe COVID-19 infection), as&#xD;
             determined by the Investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current participation in another drug or device study that, in the Investigator's&#xD;
             opinion, would interfere with participation in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current or history of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) or chronic&#xD;
             thromboembolic disease (CTED) diagnosis, per ESC 2019 guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Invasive systolic PA pressure ≥70 mmHg prior to study device entering the body&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Administration of bolus or drip/infusion thrombolytic therapy or mechanical&#xD;
             thrombectomy for the index PE event within 48 hours prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ventricular arrhythmias refractory to treatment at the time of enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known to have heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has any condition for which, in the opinion of the Investigator, participation&#xD;
             would not be in the best interest of the subject (e.g., compromise the well-being or&#xD;
             that could prevent, limit, or confound the protocol-specified assessments)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has previously completed or withdrawn from this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient unwilling or unable to conduct the follow up visits per protocol.&#xD;
