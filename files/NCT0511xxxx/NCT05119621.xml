  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study which was planned in a randomized controlled experimental design, it was&#xD;
      aimed to determine the effect of Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS)&#xD;
      application on pain level before mobilization in the postoperative period in children.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children can often experience chronic muscle, bone, joint pain, headache and abdominal pain,&#xD;
      and acutely experience pain due to postoperative and procedural procedures. Effective&#xD;
      management of childhood pain is emphasized as a health priority by the World Health&#xD;
      Organization and pain communities. The findings of various epidemiological studies emphasized&#xD;
      that a significant proportion (49% to 64%) of children receiving treatment in a hospital&#xD;
      setting received inadequate pain management services despite the increase in available&#xD;
      knowledge and treatments. One of the situations in which pediatric patients encounter acute&#xD;
      pain is the postoperative period. Mobilization is delayed in patients who cannot provide&#xD;
      adequate pain control, and accordingly, serious complications such as impaired tissue&#xD;
      perfusion, atelectasis and deep vein thrombosis may develop. There are studies on the use of&#xD;
      TENS, one of the methods used in non-pharmacological pain management, in postoperative pain&#xD;
      management in adults. Studies on pain management in children for TENS application are very&#xD;
      limited today. There was no evidence for the effectiveness of TENS application applied before&#xD;
      mobilization in the postoperative period in children.&#xD;

    <time_frame>(First measurement-After the operation, when the patient is taken to her bed and fully awakened)</time_frame>
    <description>The introductory information form was prepared by the researcher in line with the literature information. The introductory information form consists of 10 questions covering the characteristics of children and their families (age, gender, parental age, education level, family type, income status), and operational characteristics (patient's complaints, type of surgery, previous operation experience).</description>

    <measure>Children's Fear Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>(First measurement-40 minutes on average before mobilization)</time_frame>
    <description>The mean score of the scale, which was translated into Turkish by five independent linguists, was 1.9 ± 0.1 (min=0, max=4). The scale can also be scored by the parent and the researcher. The scale consists of five drawn facial expressions ranging from a neutral expression (0=no anxiety) to a frightened face (4=severe anxiety).</description>

    <measure>Visual Analogue Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>(First measurement-40 minutes on average before mobilization)</time_frame>
    <description>The scale consists of a horizontal or vertical ruler, 10 cm or 100 mm in length, showing &quot;painlessness&quot; at one end and &quot;the most severe pain&quot; at the other end. For children over the age of six, this scale is reported to be an easy-to-understand and easy-to-apply scale.</description>

    <measure>The Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>(First measurement-40 minutes on average before mobilization)</time_frame>
    <description>In this scale, there are six facial expressions representing the increasing pain intensity from 0 to 5 from left to right. Six facial expressions are scored between 0-5 points from left to right (0 points = very happy/no pain, 5 points = indicates the most severe pain). As the score obtained from the scale increases, pain tolerance decreases, and as the score decreases, the tolerance increases.</description>
