      This is a phase II, single-arm, open-label study evaluating the efficacy, safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of neoadjuvant sotorasib in combination with cisplatin (or carboplatin) and&#xD;
      pemetrexed chemotherapy for patients with surgically resectable stage IIA - IIIB (T3-T4/N2)&#xD;
      (based on AJCC 8th edition), non-squamous NSCLC with a KRAS p.G12C mutation. The primary&#xD;
      objective of the study is to determine whether neoadjuvant therapy with 4 cycles of at least&#xD;
      one dose of sotorasib plus cisplatin (or carboplatin) and pemetrexed can be administered&#xD;
      safely and result in improved MPR rate in patients with KRAS p.G12C-mutant non-squamous NSCLC&#xD;
      compared with the historical control MPR rate for platinum-based chemotherapy alone.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. [*] Subject or subject's legally acceptable representative has provided signed and&#xD;
             dated written informed consent prior to initiation of any study specific&#xD;
             activities/procedures in accordance with ICH-GCP guidelines and the local legislation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. [*]Age &gt; 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. [*]Histologically or cytologically confirmed previously untreated non-squamous&#xD;
             non-small cell lung cancer. If a diagnostic biopsy is available, a pre-treatment&#xD;
             biopsy is not required. Patients with a suspected lung cancer are eligible, but&#xD;
             pathology must be confirmed prior to initiating treatment on study. Pure squamous cell&#xD;
             carcinomas are not eligible but mixed histologies (for example adenosquamous&#xD;
             carcinoma) are eligible. Sarcomatoid carcinomas are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Neuroendocrine carcinomas are not eligible. Carcinomas with neuroendocrine&#xD;
             differentiation are eligible. Patients with mixed small-cell lung cancer and NSCLC are&#xD;
             not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Identification of a KRAS p.G12C mutation in tumor tissue or plasma by an approved&#xD;
             diagnostic device for detection of KRAS p.G12C in NSCLC or through any nucleic&#xD;
             acid-based diagnostic testing method [including droplet-digital PCR, real-time PCR&#xD;
             based methods such as the Idylla KRAS Mutation Assay (Biocartis), tissue and&#xD;
             circulating tumor DNA -based next generation sequencing, Sanger-sequencing etc]&#xD;
             performed in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified or&#xD;
             equivalently accredited laboratory. Patients meeting [*] highlighted criteria will be&#xD;
             offered study-provided droplet digital PCR or alternative PCR-based method such as the&#xD;
             Idylla KRAS Mutation Assay (Biocartis) for detection of KRAS p.G12C using tumor tissue&#xD;
             (1st choice if adequate tissue is available) or plasma (if tumor tissue is not&#xD;
             available or cannot be accessed within 5 working days). Turnaround time for reporting&#xD;
             of the presence or absence of a KRAS p.G12C mutation will be ≤ 5 working daysfor&#xD;
             plasma-based testing and ≤7 working days from the date of confirmation of tissue&#xD;
             availability for tissue-based testing. If analysis of tumor tissue fails due to&#xD;
             technical reasons, the same patient can undergo analysis of circulating tumor DNA&#xD;
             using droplet-digital PCR or alternative PCR-based method such as the Idylla KRAS&#xD;
             Mutation Assay (Biocartis). If plasma-based analysis failes to detect a KRAS p.G12C&#xD;
             mutation and tumor tissue becomes available, the same patient can undergo analysis of&#xD;
             tumor tissue using droplet digital PCR or alternative PCR-based method such as the&#xD;
             Idylla KRAS Mutation Assay (Biocartis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with disease stage IIA to select stage IIIB (T3-4N2) (according to version 8&#xD;
             of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer Staging Manual in&#xD;
             Thoracic Oncology [IASLC Staging Manual in Thoracic Oncology 2016]). Patients with&#xD;
             multistation N2 disease are eligible provided that complete surgical resection is&#xD;
             considered feasible by multidisciplinary evaluation which must include a thoracic&#xD;
             surgeon that performs lung cancer surgery as a prominent part of his/her practice&#xD;
             Invasive mediastinal staging with endosonography (EBUS or EUS) with fine-needle&#xD;
             aspiration (FNA) and/or mediastinoscopy should be completed within 42 days from the&#xD;
             start of treatment in the following cases:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  In case of mediastinal lymph nodes that are enlarged by CT criteria and/or&#xD;
                  PET-positive mediastinal lymph nodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  In case of tumors &gt; 3 cm in maximum diameter&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  In case of centrally located tumors&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For tumors with N1 nodes (cN1) Invasive mediastinal staging should include&#xD;
                  evaluation of contralateral stations 2 and/or 4 to exclude N3 disease as well as&#xD;
                  of subcarinal (station 7) lymph nodes. When there are no enlarged mediastinal&#xD;
                  lymph nodes by CT criteria and there is no uptake on PET/CT (cN0) direct surgical&#xD;
                  resection with lymph node dissection is indicated for tumors ≤ 3cm that are&#xD;
                  located in the outer third of the lung.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. [*] Absence of unequivocal evidence of stage IV disease based on contrast-enhanced CT&#xD;
             chest, abdomen, pelvis or PET/CT and brain MRI with IV contrast (or contrast-enhanced&#xD;
             CT of the head) performed within 60 days is sufficient for study registration but must&#xD;
             be confirmed with whole-body PET/CT as well as contrast-enhanced CT chest and abdomen&#xD;
             (or contrast-enhanced CT chest including the whole liver and both adrenal glands) and&#xD;
             brain MRI with IV contrast (or contrast-enhanced CT of the head) within 28 days prior&#xD;
             to the start of treatment. Patients with lesions that are considered equivocal for&#xD;
             metastatic disease in the opinion of the local principal investigator are elibile to&#xD;
             register and undergo molecular testing if they meet all other [*] marked criteria but&#xD;
             must meet the full trial eligibility criteria prior to study enrollment. In patients&#xD;
             with severe allergy to iodinated contrast absence of stage IV disease on PET/CT and&#xD;
             brain MRI with IV contrast performed within 28 days prior to enrollment suffices to&#xD;
             satisfy this eligibility criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. [*]Measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1 as determined by the local site&#xD;
             investigator/radiology assessment.&#xD;

             performed within 5 minutes).&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Subjects must have available (or accessible) and be willing to provide archival tumor&#xD;

             willing to undergo pretreatment tumor biopsy (excisional, core needle, or fine needle&#xD;
             aspirates) prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Subjects who do not have archived tissue available can be allowed to enroll without&#xD;

         12. [*]Any serious or uncontrolled medical disorder that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, may increase the risk associated with study participation or study drug&#xD;
             administration, impair the ability of the subject to receive protocol therapy, or&#xD;
             interfere with the interpretation of study results.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. [*]Serious illness or concomitant non-oncological disease such as neurologic,&#xD;

             associated with study participation or study drug administration and in the judgment&#xD;
             of the treating physician (local principal investigator or sub-investigator)would make&#xD;
             the patient inappropriate for entry into the study.&#xD;

         18. Positive test for hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg). If the patient is&#xD;
             negative for HBsAg) but has positive hepatitis B core antibody, then hepatitis B&#xD;
             surface antibody [Anti-HBs] testing is necessary (Hepatitis B core antibody testing is&#xD;
             not required for screening but if this is done and is positive, then anti-HBs testing&#xD;
             is necessary). Undetectable anti-HBs in this setting would suggest unclear and&#xD;
             possible infecition and needs exclusion. Patients receiving antiviral therapy for&#xD;
             Hepatitis B or C are not eligible.&#xD;
