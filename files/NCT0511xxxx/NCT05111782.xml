  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain is a debilitating condition experienced by people of all age groups. This study&#xD;
      will be completed in two stages in which back pain assessment tools will be first translated&#xD;
      to Urdu language and later on age-related bias on biopsychosocial factors will be assessed&#xD;
      using various biopsychosocial tools over a period of six months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain (LBP) is an extremely common symptom experienced by people of all ages. The&#xD;
      current incidence, prevalence and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) account for 245.9&#xD;
      million cases/year (15th worldwide cause; 32.4% cases associated with leg pain), 577.0&#xD;
      million cases (15th worldwide cause) and 64.9 million DALYs (6th worldwide cause),&#xD;
      respectively. In recent decades, the biopsychosocial model has been applied as a framework&#xD;
      for understanding the complexity of low back pain disability in preference to a purely&#xD;
      biomedical approach. Considering the large population of patients with LBP and limited&#xD;
      medical resources, the development of brief and efficient prognostic clinical tools for use&#xD;
      in routine practice is particularly significant. Recent data from epidemiological studies&#xD;
      suggest that LBP could affect the physical function of young and older individuals&#xD;
      differently. The age-related differ¬ences in the prevalence of some low back pathologies may&#xD;
      explain the differential treatment outcomes. The aim of the study is to explore the age bias&#xD;
      on biopsychosocial factors in persons with non-specific low back pain.&#xD;
