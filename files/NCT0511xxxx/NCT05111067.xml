  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a heterogeneous disease that is associated with a&#xD;
      younger age of onset, worse stage matched-outcomes, and women of African ancestry in North&#xD;
      America. A higher incidence of TNBC is also seen in West Africa, despite unique&#xD;
      environmental, socioeconomic and modifiable risk factors. Transcriptome analysis of TNBC has&#xD;
      delineated four distinct subgroups with therapeutic and prognostic significance. With further&#xD;
      characterization, important regional differences have emerged between populations of African&#xD;
      vs. European ancestry. These differences may have significant implications for the efficacy&#xD;
      of novel TNBC-targeted therapy and need to be further evaluated. Transcriptional data on TNBC&#xD;
      in sub-Saharan African also offers the opportunity to evaluate the relationship between&#xD;
      breast cancer phenotype and ancestry-linked differences in the tumor-immune microenvironment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to characterize the mRNA profile of TNBC in Nigeria and compare to a&#xD;
      reference population in Nova Scotia. Insight into the unique tumor-immune profile of TNBC in&#xD;
      Nigeria and the link between the West African-linked Duffy-antigen receptor for chemokines&#xD;
      (DARC) and TNBC subtype will be explored for the first time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fresh frozen TNBC tissue from the African Research Group for Oncology (ARGO) and&#xD;
      Dalhousie/NSHA breast cancer biobanks' will be processing and analyzed by the Genomics Core&#xD;
      Facility at Dalhousie University. Clinical data is prospectively collected with specimen&#xD;
      acquisition in the ARGO biobank. For the Dalhousie /NSHA biobank, clinical data will be&#xD;
      retrospectively gathered from the medical record and migrated to an electronic database for&#xD;
      prospective collection during the course of the study. Both cohorts of specimens will be run&#xD;
      through DNA and whole transcriptome (mRNA) sequencing on the TSO500 platform (Illumina Ulc.).&#xD;
      The tumor-immune microenvironment will be compared between cohorts and by mRNA cluster using&#xD;
      the transcriptional signatures for 22 leukocyte populations and immune-regulating proteins&#xD;
      CTLA-4 and PD-L1. Finally, tumor expression of DARC will be generated from the transcriptome&#xD;
      data that will allow for an assessment of the relationship between DARC expression, TNBC mRNA&#xD;
      clusters, and sociodemographic variables (i.e. race/ancestry, gender). Whole transcriptome&#xD;
      data from The Cancer Genome Atlas will be pulled as the third cohort, including 55 TNBC&#xD;
      specimens from African Americans.&#xD;
