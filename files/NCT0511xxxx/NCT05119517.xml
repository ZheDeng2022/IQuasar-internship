  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic lymphedema is defined as swelling or edema (excess fluid in the interstitial space)&#xD;
      that does not fully resolve overnight by elevating the limb or body part to the level of the&#xD;
      heart. Chronic lymphedema is a major clinical problem that is difficult to treat. Osteopathic&#xD;
      Pedal Pump is a simple manipulation technique anecdotally thought to reduce leg edema and&#xD;
      chronic lymphedema. However, the clinical evidence is only anecdotal and no clinical trials&#xD;
      have ever been conducted to test this observation. The purpose of the research is to measure&#xD;
      the effectiveness of the Osteopathic Pedal Pump technique for treating lymphedema by&#xD;
      measuring before and after treatment limb volumes. The second purpose of this project is to&#xD;
      mentor osteopathic medical students in clinical research. There is also a great need to&#xD;
      mentor Osteopathic Medical Students because relatively few pursue careers involving clinical&#xD;
      research and the benefits osteopathic manipulative treatment remain under investigated.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For phase one subjects must be age 18 or older, be a medical students at Rowan&#xD;
             University School of Osteopathic Medicine and not have leg edema which does not&#xD;
             resolve with overnight limb elevation. For phase two subjects must be patients at the&#xD;
             NJISA in Stratford, NJ age 55 and over and have lower limb lymphedema. Lymphedema is&#xD;
             defined as edema that does not resolve with overnight elevation of the lower limb.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exclusion criteria is the same for both phases. Because the measurements involve&#xD;
             placing the lower limb into water subjects with an open wound, sore or cellulitis in&#xD;
             the lower limbs will be excluded to ensure good hygiene. Because lymphatic pumping can&#xD;
             cause a redistribution of volume in the body, subjects with decompensated heart&#xD;
             failure, acute asthma, COPD exacerbation, or active cancer will be excluded. For&#xD;
             obvious reasons, those with a non-healed or healing bone fractures will be excluded.&#xD;
             Due to potential problems with informed consent those with a diagnosis of dementia on&#xD;
             the chart problem list will be excluded.&#xD;
