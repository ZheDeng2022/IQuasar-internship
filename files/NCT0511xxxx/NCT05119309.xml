  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The term &quot;Monoclonal Gammopathies of Renal Significance&quot; (MGRS) describes a group of diseases&#xD;
      characterized by the presence of an immunoglobulin or monoclonal immunoglobulin fraction that&#xD;
      has the ability to cause renal damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to diagnose MGRS correctly and early as renal survival depends on the renal&#xD;
      function present at the time of diagnosis and it is necessary to establish a specific&#xD;
      treatment that aims to stop the progression of the damage. organ and restoration of renal&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there are no targeted therapeutic strategies that can prevent the formation of&#xD;
      deposits or that can eliminate the deposits already present in the kidney, which constitute&#xD;
      the etiopathogenetic factor of these pathologies. Therefore, the only valid therapeutic&#xD;
      option is to act against the clone of B lymphocytes underlying the nephrological pathology,&#xD;
      although it is not a clone with such requirements to be able to define it as a tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, given the absence of a well-defined policy in the therapy of MGRS and the doubts&#xD;
      present on the validity of a therapeutic approach aimed at the suppression of a plasma cell&#xD;
      clone, the investigators decided to carry out an observational retrospective study with the&#xD;
      aim of describing, in a large series of MGRS treated with oncohematological therapy, the&#xD;
      renal and overall outcome of patients and identify any presenting prognostic characteristics&#xD;
      that can help improve the diagnosis of these disorders and the long-term survival of&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

      The group will be compared with patients suffering from renal disease associated with&#xD;
      oncohematological diseases with full clinical expression (multiple myeloma and B cell&#xD;
      lymphomas) which produce monoclonal component and who have been treated according to the&#xD;
      established specific schemes of each disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will have a total duration of 12 months. It will analyze the data of the patients&#xD;
      included in the clinical charts from 01/01/2010 to 31/12/2020. A total of 120 patients and 60&#xD;
      pathological controls will be enrolled (2:1 ratio), expected total number of patients from&#xD;
      the centers participating in the study enrolled through the outpatient clinics of the&#xD;
      Departments of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The variables considered in the study are routine laboratory data (renal function,&#xD;
      electrophoresis of serum and urinary proteins with immunofission, serum free light chains and&#xD;
      their ratio, proteinuria 24 h serum albumin), clinical and anamnestic data, data on current&#xD;
      drug therapy and description of renal biopsy characteristics using a predefined database with&#xD;
      statistical analysis of data.&#xD;
