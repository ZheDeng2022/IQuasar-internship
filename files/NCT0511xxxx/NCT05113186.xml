    <textblock>
      Percutaneous ablation (PA) is the only non-surgical curative treatment of hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma (HCC). Due to its excellent tolerance, particularly in patients with portal&#xD;
      hypertension or bearing comorbidities, it now represents in France nearly 70% of the&#xD;
      first-line curative treatment of &quot;in Milan&quot; tumours. For HCC less than 3 cm, ideal indication&#xD;
      for percutaneous ablations, results of monopolar radiofrequency ablation (mRFA), are&#xD;
      excellent with only 5% of reported non-tumoral control after a first procedure. In addition&#xD;
      to mRFA the arsenal of ablations has grown considerably with the emergence of new techniques&#xD;
      which allow the expansion of indications for PA, especially in patients with poor prognostic&#xD;
      tumors or relatively advanced beyond the Milan criteria. In this setting, multibipolar mode&#xD;
      using no touch technique (mbpRFAnt) increases the tumour volume than can be ablated, allowing&#xD;
      the removal of large tumors&gt; 5 cm. Inadequate tumour control is then de facto greater in&#xD;
      these situations, around 20%. Difficult-to-access tumors can furthermore be treated by&#xD;
      percutaneous irreversible electrotroporation (IRE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite a tumor burden accessible for curative ablation, a phenotype of &quot;aggressive&quot; HCC&#xD;
      characterized by high rates of local recurrences is yet to be defined. Up to now, several&#xD;
      characteristics might define this subtype with a poor-prognosis and include 1) high serum&#xD;
      alpha-foetoprotein (AFP) levels, 2) radiological infiltrative form, and 3) histological&#xD;
      macrotrabecular subtype. Based on these characteristics, median recurrence-free survival of&#xD;
      these patients is usually below 10 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High serum AFP level is a well-known predictor of HCC recurrence following curative&#xD;
      procedure. In patients treated by percutaneous ablation, regardless of the technique used and&#xD;
      irrespective of tumor burden, high baseline serum AFP level has tenaciously been reported as&#xD;
      an independent predictor or recurrence..&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently, the radiological description of infiltrative HCC (as opposed to mass-forming)&#xD;
      has been identified as an aggressive from of HCC with a poor prognosis even when eligible for&#xD;
      ablation. This aspect is often associated with infra-clinical invasion of the portal veins&#xD;
      (PV), leading to poor prognosis. Finally, a &quot;massive macrotrabecular&quot; (MTM) histological&#xD;
      subtype of HCC associated with specific molecular features has recently been described. This&#xD;
      MTM-HCC subtype, reliably observed in 12% of patients eligible for curative treatment,&#xD;
      represents an aggressive form of HCC is an independent predictor of early and overall&#xD;
      recurrence following PA, which is retained even after patient stratification according to&#xD;
      common clinical, biological, and pathological features of aggressiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The idea of optimizing HCC curative treatments using adjuvant biotherapy, particularly in&#xD;
      patients with poor-prognosis tumors in curative intent, is particularly attractive. One trial&#xD;
      in adjuvant setting was conducted, the STORM trial, that tested the benefit of sorafenib in&#xD;
      curative intent of in Milan HCC. This negative trial included patients within Milan HCC, with&#xD;
      an expected low rate of recurrence with only few patients treated by PA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lenvatinib is a multikinase inhibitor which has been recently approved as firs-line therapy&#xD;
      for advanced HCC. The investigators assume that lenvatinib could have also a synergistic&#xD;
      local action with PA in two ways. First, given as neoadjuvant regimen, lenvatinib by reducing&#xD;
      tumor and liver perfusion could decrease the global heat sink effect associated with&#xD;
      loco-regional blood microcirculation during PA. Second, by carrying on in adjuvant treatment,&#xD;
      lenvatinib could decrease the magnitude of non-specific inflammatory angiogenesis around the&#xD;
      treatment zone, therefore reducing the risk of locoregional (intrasegmental) cells tumor&#xD;
      spreading or promotion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the dismall prognosis of the aforementioned poor-prognosis HCC eligible for PA with an&#xD;
      overall median recurrence-free survival below 10 months, the investigators hypothesis is that&#xD;
      addition of Lenvatinib as neo- and adjuvant therapy might increase tumour control in these&#xD;
      difficult-to-treat patients. Patients combining either high serum AFP levels, infiltrative&#xD;
      form or MTM-HCC histological subtype represent 30% of BCLC A stage HCC patients in expert&#xD;
      centers, and are the ideal candidates for such trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the first aim of this proposal is to assess the benefit of lenvatinib in neo- and&#xD;
      adjuvant setting combined with curative percutaneous ablation for BCLC A HCC patients&#xD;
      considered at high risk of local recurrence (high AFP or infiltrative form or macrotrabecular&#xD;
      massive subtype).&#xD;
