  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess effects of core stability training on functional&#xD;
      ability, balance, gait, motor functions, quality of lite and core muscle thickness of chronic&#xD;
      stroke patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After being informed about the study all the patients giving written informed consent were&#xD;
      assessed. At the beginning the eligible patients were randomized into two groups: core&#xD;
      stability and conventional therapy group. The therapy programs were performed 5 times a week&#xD;
      for 45 min over a period of 3 weeks. Patients were assessed twice: before and after&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline score of Berg Balance Scale at week 3</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 3 (after treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>Berg Balance Scale is reliable and valid tool to assess balance and functional mobility. It is a 14 item list with each item consisting of a five-point ordinal scale ranging from 0 to 4, with 0 indicating the lowest level of function and 4 the highest level of function.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline score of Motricity Index Scale for lower extremity at week 3</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 3 (after treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The Motricity Index was used to measure strength in upper and lower extremities after stroke. Assessing lower extremity strength is a 3 item list with each item consisting of a six point scale ranging from 0 to 33 (0, 9, 14, 19, 25, 33).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline score of Trunk Control Test at week 3</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 3 (after treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>Trunk Control Test assess four simple aspect of trunk movement. Total score range: 0 to 100.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline score of 6 Minute Walk Test (6MWT) at week 3</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 3 (after treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>6MWT is valid and reliable test to assess walking capacity of stroke patients. The distance that a patient can walk within six minutes is evaluated.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline score of Functional Independence Measure (FIM) at week 3</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 3 (after treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>FIM is valid and reliable scale to assess and grade the functional status of a person based on the level of assistance he or she requires. FIM is an 18-item, seven-level, ordinal scale intended to be sensitive to changes over the course of a comprehensive inpatient medical rehabilitation program.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline score of Trunk Impairment Scale (TIS) at week 3</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 3 (after treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>TIS is a tool to assess static and dynamic sitting balance and trunk coordination in a sitting position. On the static and dynamic sitting balance and coordination subscales the maximal scores that can be attained are 7, 10 and 6 points.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline score of Timed Up and Go Test (TUG) at week 3</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 3 (after treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>TUG test is an assessment tool for measuring mobility in stroke patients. The TUG times a patient standing from a chair, walking 3 metres and returning to sit down.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline score of Stroke Specific Quality of Life Scale (SS-QOL) at week 3</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 3 (after treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>SS-QOL is a patient-centered outcome measure intended to provide an assessment of health-related quality of life specific to patients with stroke. Patients must respond to each question of the SS-QOL with reference to the past week. It is a self-report scale containing 49 items. Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline measurements Core muscle thickness at week 3</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 3 (after treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>Thickness of five core muscles (rectus abdominis, external oblique, internal oblique, transversus abdominis, multifidus and gluteus medius) are measured by ultrasound. Paretic and nonparetic side of each patient are assessed twice (at baseline and after treatment).</description>
