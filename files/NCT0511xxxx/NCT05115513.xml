  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research responds to NHTSA's request with a proposal to increase our understanding of&#xD;
      smoked cannabis' (CNB's) acute effects on driving-relevant cognition and simulated driving&#xD;
      performance, the persistence of these deficits over the hours after use, and the influence of&#xD;
      prior experience with CNB on these effects. This extension study will aim to further&#xD;
      investigate marijuana impaired behavior, using a similar design to our previous NHTSA Examine&#xD;
      the Feasibility of a Standardized Field Test for Marijuana Impairment and the prior NIDA&#xD;
      Neuroscience of Marijuana-Impaired Driving award, that used similar techniques and measures&#xD;
      to quantify marijuana impaired automobile driving. We will be utilizing tasks and assessments&#xD;
      that were shown to be strong indicators for cognitive and driving impairment in our NHTSA&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study was based upon a careful and thorough review of the scientific literature&#xD;
      describing CNB effects on cognitive test performance and driving, as well as current&#xD;
      state-of-knowledge on the sensitivity of biological assays for identifying recent CNB use.&#xD;
      The study will carefully characterize the persistence of CNB's acute effects on cognitive&#xD;
      test performance and driving over a several-hour time span. This will allow us to identify&#xD;
      the point at which any effects of CNB intoxication driving-related cognitive tests, and&#xD;
      driving performance cannot be distinguished from normal, i.e., the first step towards&#xD;
      establishing standards for legal and social policy. The data obtained from simulated driving,&#xD;
      cognitive tests, and biological assays of THC will be used in analyses aimed at identifying&#xD;
      what tests or combination of tests predict both recent use and driving impairment risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will consist of 2 days (screening visit and dose visit). In a non-randomized,&#xD;
      single blinded study, we will dose participants with placebo and high THC marijuana, about an&#xD;
      hour apart, using paced inhalation through a vaporizer, an efficient means of delivering a&#xD;
      standard THC dose. Participants will be told that the order they receive the doses will be&#xD;
      random but they will always receive the placebo first, followed by the high dose. This will&#xD;
      allow for standardization across all subjects and comparative values between placebo and&#xD;
      drug. After inhaling the placebo dose, participants will be asked to complete one round of&#xD;
      cognitive testing and a shortened version of the driving simulator (10 mins vs 30 mins).&#xD;
      Approximately one hour post placebo dose, subjects will be administered high THC marijuana.&#xD;
      Following this dosing, we will assess impairment through cognitive testing as well as a&#xD;
      simulated driving test and neuropsychological tests. Samples of blood will also be collected&#xD;
      at multiple time points throughout the study visits to be measured for THC concentration and&#xD;
      its metabolites. This allows clarification between the relationship of impairment, as well as&#xD;
      subjective and objective intoxication, and levels of THC and it's metabolites in the users&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
