  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Renal autotransplantation (RAT) is a method of removing a kidney from its place of origin in&#xD;
      a patient, repairing it, and transplanting it in another location of the body, generally the&#xD;
      iliac fossa of the same patient.RAT is a relatively new technique; the first ever RAT&#xD;
      procedure in the US was performed in 1963. Advances in preservation and transplantation&#xD;
      techniques have made RAT a modality that can be utilized in complex renal diseases. RAT is&#xD;
      indicated for conditions such as renal vascular disease, nutcracker syndrome, pelvic venous&#xD;
      congestion, pelvic trauma, refractory stone disease and, in some cases, loin pain hematuria&#xD;
      syndrome and conventionally unresectable renal tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Irrespective of the excellent outcomes shown by RAT, the conventional open approach requires&#xD;
      a large midline xiphoid-to-pubis or flank incision for donor nephrectomy with a second pelvic&#xD;
      incision for renal transplantation into the iliac fossa.The current gold standard approach to&#xD;
      RAT is a laparoscopic nephrectomy followed by open auto-transplantation. However, this&#xD;
      approach still requires a large pelvic incision. Robotic technology enables us to perform&#xD;
      more complex minimally invasive surgery. Gordon et al. performed and reported the first&#xD;
      completely intracorporeal robotic RAT to repair a ureteral injury in 2014.&#xD;

      This is a retrospective chart review case series study of all consecutive cases in which&#xD;
      robotic RAT was performed that meet the study inclusion and exclusion criteria. The case&#xD;
      series will be performed starting from January 2018 until June 2021 to include all cases of&#xD;
      robotic RAT procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perioperative and short-term clinical data will be obtained from the EMR. All the data&#xD;
      variables will be documented in the case report forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because the data will have been de-identified and is archival in nature, there will be no&#xD;
      active subject recruitment and no patient consenting is required.&#xD;
