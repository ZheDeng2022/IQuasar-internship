  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      About six months after patellastabilizing surgery postoperative restrictions are commonly&#xD;
      lifted and patients may consider whether a return to activity/sports is feasible. Currently,&#xD;
      there are no evidence-based criteria to determine a patients readiness for sports and/or&#xD;
      activity (RTS) following stabilizing surgery. The purpose of this project was therefore to&#xD;
      investigate the feasibility of a test battery to evaluate knee function in postoperative&#xD;
      follow-up evaluation - and in RTS decisions - for patients with patellar instability. Banff&#xD;
      Patellofemoral Instability Instrument 2.0 and Norwich Patellar Instability Score is being&#xD;
      translated and validaten in a Norwegian population.&#xD;

    <description>At baseline, approximately 3 weeks before surgery and 6 months after surgery: patients conduct a testbattery consisting of 2 PROMs: the NPI-No and BPII2.0-No together with four physical tests: isokinetic strength tests, hop tests, Y-balance test and forward step down test. For the cross-cultural validation of NPI and BPII2.0 patients also conduct KOOS, IKDC 2000 and Tampa Scale.</description>
