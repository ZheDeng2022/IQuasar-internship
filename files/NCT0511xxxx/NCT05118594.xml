  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of an evidence-based system to&#xD;
      recommend core interventions, before the beginning of treatment, to psychotherapists treating&#xD;
      low-income patients with depressive or anxiety disorders.&#xD;

      After providing a written inform consent, potential patients will undergo a 2-weeks screening&#xD;
      period to determine if they meet eligibility criteria. Baseline information (i.e., derived&#xD;
      from semi-structured intake interviews and baseline clinical measures) from patients who meet&#xD;
      eligibility criteria and consent to participate in the study, will be use to feed a machine&#xD;
      learning algorithm, developed in a previous study, to perform individual predictions and&#xD;
      determine which interventions (i.e., cognitive, behavioral, interpersonal, or&#xD;
      patient-centered) will be recommended for the individual patient. This recommendation (i.e.,&#xD;
      about the most personally well-suited intervention for a given patient) will be provided to&#xD;
      therapists before the beginning of treatment. Patients will be treated with 15 sessions of&#xD;
      psychotherapy. The investigators will examine the extent to which therapists adhered to the&#xD;
      recommended interventions as the primary outcome. The investigators will also examine patient&#xD;
      symptomatic/functional improvement as a secondary outcome.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 15</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-9 is a validated 9-item self-reported measure of depression severity grounded on the diagnostic criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV), with higher scores representing greater severity. Items are rated on a four-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (&quot;Not at all&quot;) to 3 (&quot;Nearly every day&quot;).&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 15</time_frame>
    <description>The GAD-7 is a self-reported measure that evaluates the overall anxiety severity with seven items rated on a four-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (&quot;Not at all) to 3 (&quot;Nearly every day&quot;). Greater scores represents higher severity.&#xD;
Change= Estimated weekly change on severity from Baseline to Week 15 from a multilevel growth curve model</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Overall Functioning on the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS) at Week 15</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 15</time_frame>
    <description>The WHODAS is a validated self-reported measure that evaluates overall functioning with 12 items rated on a five-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (&quot;None&quot;) to 4 (&quot;Extreme&quot;). Greater scores represents higher disability.&#xD;

    <measure>Average Adherence to the Recommended Interventions on the Multitheoretical List of Therapeutic Interventions (MULTI-30) Across Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1 and Week 15</time_frame>
    <description>The MULTI-30 is a validated and reliable measure to assessed the adherence to therapeutic interventions in a given session. Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (&quot;Not at all typical to the session&quot;) to 5 (&quot;Very typical to the session&quot;). For the project the investigators will test the following MULTI-30 subscales: Cognitive, Behavioral, Interpersonal, and Person-centered. In this study the investigators will use the therapist version of the MULTI-30.&#xD;
Average Adherence= Mean Score of the Recommended Interventions Across all the Sessions of the Treatment.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 15</time_frame>
    <description>The MINI is a brief structured diagnostic interview for psychiatric disorders developed based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) and the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnostic criteria. Several studies have positioned the MINI as a highly reliable and valid instrument for determine psychiatric disorders.&#xD;
