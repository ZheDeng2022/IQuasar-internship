  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The IRENE-G trial is a randomized controlled study that aims to investigate the effect of a&#xD;
      supervised resistance exercise program (2x/week for 24 weeks) in combination with a&#xD;
      nutritional intervention on physical performance/frailty in patients with GvHD symptoms&#xD;
      treated with high dose steroids.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) remains the major complication and limitation to successful&#xD;
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Treatment of GvHD is&#xD;
      challenging, with high-dose steroids remaining the established first-line treatment in both&#xD;
      acute and chronic GvHD. Long-term doses of systemic corticosteroids have many well-known&#xD;
      side-effects such as myopathy, though often an overlooked diagnosis. Previous studies in&#xD;
      non-cancer patients treated with corticosteroids demonstrated that resistance training can&#xD;
      reverse muscle atrophy and weakness. Despite the beneficial effects of exercise, no research&#xD;
      effort to date has explicitly examined the effect of a progressive moderate-to-high intensity&#xD;
      resistance training on the physical performance and well-being of GvHD patients treated with&#xD;
      high-dose steroids. As GvHD patients are commonly found to be malnourished, which affects&#xD;
      muscle mass and strength and thus quality of life, nutritional endorsement and optimization&#xD;
      should be considered when investigating the effect of exercise in GvHD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IRENE-G study (acronym for Impact of Resistance Exercise and Nutritional Endorsement on&#xD;
      GvHD symptoms) is a 24 week prospective, randomized controlled intervention trial with a&#xD;
      two-armed parallel design and 1:1 allocation ratio of GvHD patients treated with high-dose&#xD;
      steroids.The exploratory study examines and compares the effects of a supervised resistance&#xD;
      exercise intervention - 2x per week, 60 minutes - and a nutritional optimisation program&#xD;
      (experimental group) against a nutritional optimisation program only (control group) on&#xD;
      physical performance in GvHD patients treated with high-dose steroids. We hypothesize that&#xD;
      patients in the experimental group will show significantly greater improvements (or an&#xD;
      attenuated decrement) in their physical performance after 24-weeks compared to the control&#xD;
      group. Moreover, the investigators hypothesized that the experimental group will have lower&#xD;
      levels of fatigue, a higher perceived quality of life, better muscle strength values and a&#xD;
      higher vastus lateralis muscle volume, a better nutritional status as well as a better&#xD;
      submaximal endurance capacity compared to the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the basis of power calculations, the goal is to include 56 patients per intervention arm,&#xD;
      resulting in a total patient number of n=112.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments will take place at week 8, 16 and 24 after baseline. A follow-up assessment is&#xD;
      planned at week 48.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of IRENE-G is physical performance measured via the Short Physical&#xD;
      Performance Battery. Further endpoints are muscle strength and volume, submaximal endurance&#xD;
      capacity, nutritional status and patient-reported outcomes such as quality of life and&#xD;
      fatigue.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from baseline to week 24 in Physical performance, as measured by the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 24 weeks (&amp; 6 month follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>Physical Performance will be assessed with the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). The SPPB is based on three timed tasks: 4-meter walking speed test, standing balance (feet side-by-side, semi-tandem, full tandem) and sit-to-stand test. Participants score on each component of the battery. Each task is scored out of 4. The sum of the three assessments comprised the final SPPB score with a possible range from 0 to 12. A higher score represents a higher level of function, while lower level indicate lower level of function. Change = (Week 24 Score - Baseline Score). The SPPB is a well-established instrument for the measurement of physical performance, commonly used is elderly patients both in hospital and community setting.</description>

    <description>The study participants receive a progressive moderate-to-high-intensity resistance training program (a 60 minutes twice a week for a period of 24- weeks) plus nutritional endorsement. The training will take place at the NCT Heidelberg, in regional qualified facility centers or online under supervision and guidance of experienced exercise therapists.&#xD;
The progressive resistance program for participants who train at facility centers comprises of 6 machine-based exercises, each performed 2 sets,12 repetitions of 60%-80% of 1 RM. For participants who train online, the training load will be defined during the introductory training session with the aim of choosing a load which to perform two times 12 repetitions. The program targets major upper and lower body muscle groups (with emphasis on the lower extremities). In addition, patients receive nutritional advice/diet modification, depending on their individual requirements and/or changes in general condition.</description>
