      This study aims to quantify the variation in postprandial AA profiles between (and within)&#xD;
      individuals after consumption of a poorly digestible plant protein source (Lucerne) and to&#xD;
      compare the variation in postprandial AA profiles between a poorly digestible plant protein&#xD;
      source and an easy digestible protein source (whey).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has a randomised, cross-over, controlled design. Two different treatments, all&#xD;
      representing a 20g protein load, will be evaluated on five occasions with a washout period of&#xD;
      minimum one week between the test days. On test days, research subjects will receive two&#xD;
      different protein sources, in the form of a protein drink, in randomised order; on three test&#xD;
      days they will receive a poor-digestible protein source, on two test days an easily&#xD;
      digestible protein source. Blood will be collected via a catheter before and up-to four hours&#xD;
      after protein consumption. Wellbeing, health complaints or other adverse effects will be&#xD;
      collected via short questionnaires during each test day. After each test day gastrointestinal&#xD;
      complaints will be collected via an online questionnaire.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is currently no information on personal protein digestion variability. We recently&#xD;
      performed a human intervention study on protein digestibility and absorption and observed&#xD;
      that postprandial plasma amino acid (AA) profiles from an easy digestible animal protein were&#xD;
      highly comparable among individuals. However, the same profiles from a less digestible&#xD;
      plant-protein source (e.g. water lentil) showed a large variability among individuals. But in&#xD;
      order to really speak of personalized digestibility, we must be able to demonstrate that the&#xD;
      absorption rate of an individual is reproducible. Demonstrating personal differences in AA&#xD;
      uptake kinetics will affect the way we value (new) protein sources. Determining and&#xD;
      quantifying individual differences in digestion and absorption will allow us to better&#xD;
      predict nutritional value of products and diets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to quantify the variation in postprandial AA profiles between (and&#xD;
      within) individuals after consumption of a poorly digestible plant protein source (Lucerne).&#xD;
      Secondary objective is to compare the variation in postprandial AA profiles between a poorly&#xD;
      digestible plant protein source and an easy digestible protein source (whey).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has a randomised, cross-over, controlled design. Two different treatments, all&#xD;
      representing a 20g protein load, will be evaluated on five occasions with a washout period of&#xD;
      minimum one week between the test days. On test days, research subjects will receive two&#xD;

      after protein consumption. Wellbeing, health complaints or other adverse effects will be&#xD;
