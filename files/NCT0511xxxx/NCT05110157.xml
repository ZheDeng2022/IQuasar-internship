      Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy, safety,&#xD;
      and tolerability of valbenazine when administered orally once daily as adjunctive treatment&#xD;
      in subjects with schizophrenia who have had an inadequate response to antipsychotics. The&#xD;
      study will enroll approximately 400 subjects with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. The expected&#xD;
      duration of study participation for each subject is approximately 16 weeks.&#xD;
