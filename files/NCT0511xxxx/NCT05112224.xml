    <textblock>
      This was a randomized controlled trial to assess how an education program based on health&#xD;
      belief model (HBM) may affect oral health status in the elementary school going children. For&#xD;
      this, a convenient sample including 112 school going children aged between 6-12 years old&#xD;
      were recruited and randomized into intervention or control groups. Education program&#xD;
      consisted five weekly session each lasted for 1 hour approximately. Based on the main&#xD;
      constructs of the HBM, each session was organized and a combination of educational methods&#xD;
      were used in the intervention group while the control group only received the routine program&#xD;
      provided by the dental clinic. Measures such as papillary bleeding index; decayed, missing,&#xD;
      filled teeth (DMFT) and a scale based on the HBM were used for data collection. Three months&#xD;
      after the intervention the measures were administered again and comparisons between baseline&#xD;
      and follow-up were done.&#xD;

      Oral health problems especially dental carries are common in school children and education&#xD;
      programs may help to prevent these conditions. The aim of current study was to investigate&#xD;
      how an education program based on health belief model (HBM) may improve oral health status of&#xD;
      the elementary school children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred twelve 6-12 year children along with one of their parents assigned into trial and&#xD;
      control groups using a randomized controlled trial. For trial group 5 education sessions&#xD;
      based on HBM were held, whereas control group only received routine education program&#xD;
      delivered by the dental clinic. Decayed, missing, filled teeth (DMFT) score, papillary&#xD;
      bleeding index, and HBM questionnaire for oral were used for evaluation of the program. Three&#xD;
      month after the intervention reassessment was performed and the changes were measured by&#xD;
      student t test as well as analysis of covariance test.&#xD;
