  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is An Open, Single Arm, Multicenter, Exploratory Phase II study, to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of TQB2450 Plus anlotinib as adjuvant therapy in hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma(HCC) patients at high risk of recurrence after resection. The patients who are&#xD;
      confirmed by Histology or cytology as HCC with high-risk recurrence after R0 liver resection&#xD;
      will be enrolled. 18 cycles adjuvant treatment with TQB2450 Plus anlotinib can improve&#xD;
      one-year recurrence free survival (RFS) rate of HCC patients after R0 surgical resection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TQB-2450 is a humanized mAb of PD-L1 that prevents PD-L1 from binding to PD-1 and B7.1&#xD;
      receptors on the T cell surface, enabling T cells to restore immune activity and thus enhance&#xD;
      the immune response. Anlotinib is a novel multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) for&#xD;
      tumor angiogenesis and proliferative signaling.&#xD;
