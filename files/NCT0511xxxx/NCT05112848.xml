  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, randomized, observer-blinded study evaluating the safety and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 with Matrix-M™ Adjuvant in people living with human&#xD;
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (PLWH) and HIV- negative adults, seronegative to SARS-CoV-2 at&#xD;
      baseline.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigational product will be a monovalent Serum Institute of India (SII) severe&#xD;
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 recombinant spike protein nanoparticle vaccine&#xD;
      (SARS-CoV-2-rS) at a dose of 5 µg antigen adjuvanted with 50 µg Matrix-M (referred hereafter&#xD;
      as NVX-CoV2373). A total of 270 PLWH, 18 to 65 years of age, inclusive, will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned 1:1:1 to receive NVX-CoV2373 in either a two-dose regimen on Day 0 and Day 21 or Day&#xD;
      0 and Day 70 or a three-dose regimen on Days 0, 21, and 70. Randomization of PLWH will be&#xD;
      stratified by level of control of HIV infection to distribute well-controlled and&#xD;
      less-well-controlled participants approximately evenly among all the 3 PLWH treatment groups.&#xD;
      Approximately 90 HIV-negative participants, 18 to 65 years of age, inclusive, will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned 1:1 to receive NVX-CoV2373 in a two-dose regimen on Day 0 and Day 21 or Day&#xD;
      0 and Day 70. All HIV-negative participants will be baseline seronegative (for SARS-CoV-2).&#xD;
      Placebo (normal saline solution) will be administered to participants who receive a two-dose&#xD;
      regimen of NVX-CoV2373 to maintain overall blinding.&#xD;
