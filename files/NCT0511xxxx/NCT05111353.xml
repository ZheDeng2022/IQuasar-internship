    <textblock>
      This is a randomized phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the safety of a neoantigen peptide&#xD;
      vaccine strategy in pancreatic cancer patients following neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The&#xD;
      neoantigen peptide vaccines will incorporate prioritized neoantigens and personalized&#xD;
      mesothelin epitopes and will be co-administered with poly-ICLC. Patients will be randomized&#xD;
      to one of two arms: Arm 1 (neoantigen vaccine following neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgery)&#xD;
      or Arm 2 (neoantigen vaccine following neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the window prior to&#xD;
      surgery).&#xD;

             might make it difficult for the patient to complete the full course of treatments or&#xD;
             to generate an immune response to vaccines. In the case of asthma or chronic&#xD;
             obstructive pulmonary disease taking inhaled corticosteroids that does not require&#xD;
             daily systemic corticosteroids is acceptable. Additionally, local acting steroids&#xD;
             (topical, inhaled, or intraarticular) will be allowed. Patients on intermittent or&#xD;
             short course steroids will be allow if the dose does not exceed 4 mg of dexamethasone&#xD;
             (or equivalent) per day for &gt; 7 consecutive days. Any patients receiving steroids&#xD;
             should be discussed with the PI to determine if eligible.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Step 1 Eligibility: At Step 1 eligibility confirmation prior to vaccination, the above&#xD;
        criteria must be met plus:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Completed at least 4 months of neoadjuvant chemotherapy such as FOLFIRINOX, modified&#xD;
             FOLFIRINOX, or gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel. Dose modifications and/or delays in&#xD;
             neoadjuvant chemotherapy may be made at the discretion of the treating physician&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Reimaging within 4 weeks of last dose of chemotherapy demonstrates no evidence of&#xD;
             progressive disease. Patients who progress on mFOLFIRINOX and transition to&#xD;
             gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel can remain on study at discretion of PI and treating MD&#xD;
             provided they do not show progression following completion of chemotherapy. Patients&#xD;
             who, in the opinion of the treating physician, require SBRT prior to surgery will&#xD;
             receive vaccine after surgery regardless of randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  There is a 1 week washout prior to Day 1 of vaccine for patients on daily systemic&#xD;
             steroids at doses exceeding 10 mg prednisone.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must not be receiving or have received any other investigational agents within the&#xD;
             last 30 days. Note that patients who are receiving or will be receiving adjuvant&#xD;
             chemotherapy are permitted to continue on study and are considered eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first day of treatment. Examples&#xD;
             of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps,&#xD;
             rubella, varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus&#xD;
             Calmette-Guerin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection&#xD;
             are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza&#xD;
             vaccines (e.g. FluMist) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sufficient wound healing per the evaluation of the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If a patient experiences disease progression or recurrence during neoadjuvant&#xD;
             chemotherapy, or is otherwise unable to complete a surgical resection after sufficient&#xD;
             progress has been made on the vaccine production, the participant may still receive&#xD;
             treatment with the peptide vaccine. Eligibility for continued participation in these&#xD;
             cases will be at the treating physician and PI's discretion.&#xD;
