  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a double-blind, randomized, trial of a commercially available meal-replacement&#xD;
      shake versus a placebo control designed to evaluate the impact on quality of life, safety,&#xD;
      and tolerability. It also includes a randomized, non-blinded third arm consisting of only&#xD;
      dietary guidelines.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 219 participants will be recruited for the study following screening, with the&#xD;
      expectation that approximately 200 participants will complete the trial. The 219 participants&#xD;
      will be randomized to the three different study arms, 73 participants per arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will be mostly virtual, with in-person visits to a laboratory facility for blood&#xD;
      draws, as well as standardized BMI calculations, waist circumference, and blood pressure&#xD;
      readings. A technology platform will be utilized to screen, enroll and capture study data of&#xD;
      the participants.&#xD;
