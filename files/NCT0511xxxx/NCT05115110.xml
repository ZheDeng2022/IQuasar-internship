  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Risdiplam works by helping the body produce more survival motor neuron (SMN) protein&#xD;
      throughout the body. This means fewer motor neurons - nerve cells that pass impulses from&#xD;
      nerves to muscles to cause movement - are lost, which may improve how well muscles work in&#xD;
      people with SMA. RO7204239 is an investigational anti-myostatin antibody that is designed to&#xD;
      target myostatin. Myostatin plays an important role in the regulation of skeletal muscle size&#xD;
      by controlling growth. Inhibiting myostatin may help muscles grow in size and strength.&#xD;
      RO7204239 in combination with risdiplam, which is designed to increase the amount of SMN&#xD;
      protein throughout the body, has the potential to further improve motor function and clinical&#xD;
      outcomes for people living with SMA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will study the safety and efficacy of RO7204239 in combination with risdiplam in&#xD;
      children aged 2-10 years with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) that are ambulant.&#xD;
