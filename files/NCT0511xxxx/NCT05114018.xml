  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of pasteurized Akkermansia&#xD;
      muciniphila (pAKK) in improving insulin sensitivity in hyperglycaemic, but otherwise healthy&#xD;
      persons with metabolic syndrome. This is the primary objective of this study. Secondary&#xD;
      objectives consist of evaluation of the effects of next generation beneficial microbes on&#xD;
      metabolic health, anthropometry and body composition, and safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the trial is designed as a phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      parallel group, multi-center trial comparing pAKK with placebo in restoring insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity in dysglycaemic but otherwise healthy subjects with metabolic syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In total, 98 enrolled participants will attend 6 study visits in total. Study visits may be&#xD;
      conducted in the clinic, at home by a Healthcare Professional, or by telephone /&#xD;
      telemedicine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overweight and obesity have reached worldwide epidemic level. Observation of elevated&#xD;
      glycaemia like impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance are reflecting&#xD;
      pre-diabetic states often occurring in the context of development of insulin resistance in&#xD;
      persons with metabolic syndrome. Moreover, this status is associated with the risk for&#xD;
      developing type 2 diabetes as well as cardiovascular disease. In a proof of concept study the&#xD;
      supplementation with A. muciniphila was safe and improved metabolic health in persons with&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of pasteurized Akkermansia&#xD;
      muciniphila (pAKK) in improving insulin sensitivity in hyperglycaemic, but otherwise healthy&#xD;

      objectives consist of evaluation of the effects of next generation beneficial microbes on&#xD;
      metabolic health, anthropometry and body composition, and safety.&#xD;
