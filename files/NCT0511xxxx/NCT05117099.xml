  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is clear that the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted families adversely in multiple ways,&#xD;
      including economic stressors, mental health-related functioning, social/familial functioning,&#xD;
      as well as responses to mandated safety measures (e.g. social distancing, stay-at-home&#xD;
      orders, mask-wearing). Furthermore, families of school-age children have had to navigate&#xD;
      online instruction and home schooling in the context of these difficult circumstances with&#xD;
      little preparation for doing so effectively. School districts have varied widely in their&#xD;
      ability to support parents during this crisis. These stressors are likely to have&#xD;
      disproportionately adverse effects on lower-income and racial/ ethnic minority populations,&#xD;
      for whom economic, academic, and family-level challenges were already pronounced. For&#xD;
      instance, health effects of COVID-19 have hit African American and Latinx populations with&#xD;
      disproportionate severity, including higher rates of hospitalization and death. Given the&#xD;
      scale of pandemic impacts for families with school-aged children, the identification of&#xD;
      effective family-focused interventions that target core mechanisms of change with a broad&#xD;
      range of benefits for parents and youth across diverse populations, and that can be brought&#xD;
      to scale rapidly and with fidelity, represent critical public health goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study will adapt and test the efficacy of the Family Check-Up Online as a&#xD;
      treatment to foster resilient family functioning in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We&#xD;
      will test the effects of the adapted FCU Online program on key mechanisms of change that we&#xD;
      predict will directly impact child and family functioning: parenting skills, parental&#xD;
      depression, and parent and child self-regulation. We predict that changes in these key&#xD;
      targets of the intervention will impact participant's response to the COVID-19 pandemic,&#xD;
      including youth depression and behavior problems, the ability to cope with pandemic-focused&#xD;
      stressors, and social/familial functioning.&#xD;
