  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The WINGMEN trial aims to understand how a hormone-like protein called insulin-like growth&#xD;
      factor (IGF) helps prostate cancers grow and become aggressive. IGF is required for normal&#xD;
      development, and also helps cancers grow and spread. Men with high blood IGF are at increased&#xD;
      risk of developing prostate cancer, and tall men are more likely to get aggressive prostate&#xD;
      cancer. The WINGMEN trial will recruit 30 men with prostate cancer who have been offered an&#xD;
      operation to remove the prostate. Most men have to wait 4-5 weeks between a decision to have&#xD;
      prostate removal surgery, and actually having the operation. In this 4-5 week window we will&#xD;
      offer treatment with a new IGF-blocker drug called xentuzumab. The drug is provided by&#xD;
      Boehringer Ingelheim and the trial is funded by Prostate Cancer UK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Xentuzumab will be given as an outpatient by once weekly intravenous infusion (drip) in the&#xD;
      Early Phase Clinical Trials Unit, Oxford Cancer Centre, Churchill Hospital. In other trials,&#xD;
      xentuzumab is being tested in patients with advanced cancer, and is proving to be&#xD;
      well-tolerated. After the 4-week treatment, WINGMEN trial patients will have routine prostate&#xD;
      removal surgery. Samples of blood and prostate cancer that are surplus to diagnostic need&#xD;
      will be taken from the diagnostic prostate biopsy (pre-xentuzumab) and the cancer removed at&#xD;
      surgery (after xentuzumab) for research tests. These samples will be compared to measure how&#xD;
      effectively xentuzumab reduces signs of tumour growth, and identify which genes and proteins&#xD;
      are switched on or off by xentuzumab, and which may therefore be important in helping IGF&#xD;
      promote prostate cancer growth. The information we get from the WINGMEN trial may help us to&#xD;
      improve treatment of men with prostate cancer, with the long-term aim of reducing the risk of&#xD;
      aggressive prostate cancer&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Men with prostate adenocarcinoma confirmed on prostate biopsy and with sufficient&#xD;
             cancer-containing biopsy tissue surplus to diagnostic need to provide 2 sections for&#xD;
             primary endpoint analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Scheduled for open or robotic radical prostatectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
