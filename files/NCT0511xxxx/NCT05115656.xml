  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients face notable impairments which lead to reduced&#xD;
      performance and regulation of daily and overall functioning. There are a number of&#xD;
      interventions made to combat these qualms; however, such interventions have historically been&#xD;
      therapeutically demanding, which limits their practical benefit. A mindfulness-based&#xD;
      therapeutic intervention can provide a cost-effective approach that can be particularly&#xD;
      well-suited to the needs and limitations of TBI. It focuses both on developing awareness and&#xD;
      attention, which are often impaired, and are critical to improving emotional and behavioral&#xD;
      regulation and everyday function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project is aimed at assessing the effectiveness and underlying mechanism of modified&#xD;
      mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) using a rigorous randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
      Poised to provide a rigorous approach to efficacy development and analysis, Results of the&#xD;
      study will provide valuable information that will ultimately support the refinement of an&#xD;
      intervention that can have a real impact on patients' ability to resume a fully functional&#xD;
      and satisfying life, and the design of an adequate therapeutic intervention for TBI patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TBI patients suffer from a host of cognitive and behavioral deficits that requires a&#xD;
      comprehensive therapeutic approach to be effective at improving self-regulation and everyday&#xD;
      function. These deficits can affect a number of critical aspects of individual performance&#xD;
      such as awareness, emotional regulation, and self-efficacy. As an alchemy, these serve to be&#xD;
      instrumental to TBI patients' emotional regulation capability, and serve as complements to&#xD;
      overall satisfactory executive functioning. Efforts have been made in therapeutics to&#xD;
      supersede barriers to improving these factors in the form of interventions. Those observed in&#xD;
      history had required considerable resources, evident in the apparent high cognitive load and&#xD;
      by limits to their effective implementation, wide dissemination and, ultimately, their&#xD;
      potential benefit to TBI patients. At present, it is fundamental to explore the benefits of a&#xD;
      mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR), an intervention promising a favorable effect on&#xD;
      both attention and present moment awareness (Aim 1), effectiveness in developing emotional&#xD;
      regulation and everyday life function (Aim 2), and structured to permit investigation of the&#xD;
      functional and structural neural effects on attention (Aim 3). This hypothesis aims to prove&#xD;
      these attributes are central to the development of adaptive self-monitoring and&#xD;
      self-regulation skills that can be used in a real life environment. The study results will&#xD;
      provide valuable information that will ultimately support the refinement of an effective&#xD;
      intervention that can have a real impact on patients' ability to improve quality of life,&#xD;
      community integration, and supporting an active lifestyle. In addition, acquired neuroimaging&#xD;
      will aid in analyzing the effect of the intervention on brain function which will allow for a&#xD;
      more established comprehension of the underlying mechanisms driving the benefits, permitting&#xD;
      improved design of an effective therapeutic intervention for TBI patients.&#xD;

               -  Loss of consciousness exceeding 30 minutes (unless due to sedation or&#xD;
                  intoxication)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  GCS in the emergency department of less than 13 (unless due to intubation,&#xD;
                  sedation, or intoxication);&#xD;

          3. Presence of a deficit in sustained attention as measured by the Attention-Related&#xD;
             Cognitive Errors Scale (ARCES) [69] score greater than 3.5 or presence of a deficit in&#xD;
             sustained attention as measured by the sustained attention to response task (SART)&#xD;
             [64]. Impairment will be defined as having omissions or the reaction time variability&#xD;
             scores, two measures of &quot;inattentiveness,&quot; one standard deviation above the normative&#xD;
             mean.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Willingness and ability to participate in all testing and the 10-week intervention and&#xD;
             daily home activities/exercises.&#xD;

&#xD;
        General Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Severe cognitive impairment as defined by a Mini-Mental State Examination score &lt; 18.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Any previous neurological injury or illness in addition to the documented TBI (e.g.&#xD;
             epilepsy, MS).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Active substance abuse&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Acquired brain injury of nontraumatic origin&#xD;

             participation in this research study&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Significant psychiatric history (e.g. schizophrenia, bipolar disorder) due to the&#xD;
             potential influence of such disorders on cognitive functioning (because of the&#xD;
             prevalence of depression/anxiety in the TBI population, subjects will not be excluded&#xD;
             based on a history of depression/anxiety; rather, these will be controlled by&#xD;
             including measures of depression/anxiety as covariates in group-level analyses)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Had previously participated in regular mindfulness based activities such as meditation&#xD;
             and yoga.&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Have had a penetrating TBI&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Left handed (to control for hand dominance effect on neuroimaging)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Focal injury if the injury necessitated neurosurgical intervention and/or caused gross&#xD;
             derangement of neuroanatomy (Given that TBI is most often represented by mixed&#xD;
             pathophysiology and diffuse axonal injury is nearly universal findings, focal injury&#xD;
             will not be a systematic exclusionary criteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. For all study participants, additional exclusionary criteria associated with MRI will&#xD;
             be discussed and enforced. This includes, conditions contraindicated for MRI&#xD;
             (implanted metallic devices-aneurysm clips, pacemakers, claustrophobia for subject&#xD;
             safety), surgical hardware in the head or cervical spine will also be excluded due to&#xD;
             potential for severe image artifacts. We will be using the RONIC MRI screening form&#xD;
             for this purpose.&#xD;
