  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women. The morbidity and mortality of breast&#xD;
      cancer are much higher than those observed with other female cancers (1). The incidence of&#xD;
      breast cancer increases with age (2, 3). Approximately 1.7 million new cases are estimated to&#xD;
      occur worldwide, and mortality is increasing in developing countries, primarily because the&#xD;
      disease is not diagnosed until it is in an advanced stage(4) Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT)&#xD;
      is considered the standard of care for the management of locally advanced breast cancer and&#xD;
      although this treatment has historically been reserved for those with inoperable breast&#xD;
      cancer now is increasingly being used for women with earlier stage disease. (5). Encouraging&#xD;
      results obtained with neoadjuvant chemotherapy in have resulted in clinicians using&#xD;
      preoperative chemotherapy for patients with smaller tumors(6) . Neoadjuvant chemotherapy&#xD;
      (NACT) could reduce surgical morbidity of the breast and axilla. By down staging of the&#xD;
      tumor, NACT can convert patients who are candidates for mastectomy to breast-conserving&#xD;
      surgery (BCS) candidates [7]. Furthermore, it has potential to reduce excision volumes in&#xD;
      patients with large tumors who are already candidates for BCS. Another surgical advantage is&#xD;
      down staging of the axilla so that axillary lymph node dissection can be avoided (8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complete pathological response after neoadjuvant systemic treatment is high, while complete&#xD;
      clinical response rates are even higher. Because it is difficult to localize the original&#xD;
      tumor bed after a complete clinical and radiological response, marking the tumor before the&#xD;
      start of neoadjuvant systemic treatment is required to enable breast-conserving surgery&#xD;
      afterward. Achieving adequate margins of excision is an important component of breast&#xD;
      surgery. Local recurrence rates are significantly higher for patients who have positive&#xD;
      margins of excision (9) some prospective and retrospective data suggested that patients with&#xD;
      BCT after neoadjuvant therapy may have an increased risk for the development of a local&#xD;
      recurrence .&#xD;
&#xD;
      If this were true, there would be no further advantage of neoadjuvant therapy and this&#xD;
      treatment option could be questioned altogether.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A common question raised with respect to performing breast-conserving therapy after&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy is the volume of breast tissue that should be resected&#xD;

      Study subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Inclusion criteria:&#xD;

             1. Female patients with operable breast cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Female Patient aged from 20 to 60 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Patients who are fit for general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Patients who provide a written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Patient who agree to provide short term outcome data and agree to provide contact&#xD;
                information to provide contact information.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Female patients less than 20 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Stage 4 breast cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Patient has no pathological or clinical response to NACT&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Patients who are contraindicated for radiotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Pregnant patients in first trimester&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Patient with inflammatory carcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Sample Size Calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective trial study include 50 patient whom fulfilled the inclusion criteria 2.4.4 -Study&#xD;
      tools (in detail, e.g., lab methods, instruments, steps, chemicals, â€¦): This prospective&#xD;
      study is including patients will be diagnosed breast cancer and will receive neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy .&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients underwent a preoperative clinical evaluation including physical examination&#xD;
      (PE), ultrasonography, mammograph and MRI then biopsies of the breast tumor were performed to&#xD;
      determine the histological subtype and receptor status Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pro-operative preparation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After confirming diagnosis of breast cancer and its molecular type patient undergoing marking&#xD;
      the tumor and axillary lymph nodes by clips before receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Making Virtual pre-operative breast conserving surgical technique based on the previous tumor&#xD;
      size&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Surgical steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Depending on new tumor size ,site of the tumor ,breast cup size and degree of breast&#xD;
           ptosis ;oncoplastic breast conserving technique would be selected&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A prophylactic antibiotic as first generation cephalosporin is given intravenous.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin preparation by povidine iodine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Excision of the mass with safety margin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sentinel axillary lymph node or complete axillary clearance depend on axillary lymph&#xD;
           node status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All specimens were oriented with sutures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A frozen section examination of the specimen was performed intraoperative&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  When the margin status was inadequate, a re-excision was performed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Closure as drawn by different oncoplastic technique&#xD;
