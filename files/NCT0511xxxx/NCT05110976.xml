  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first in human (FIH) clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of AZD8630 in healthy adults (Part A) and adult asthma&#xD;
      patients on medium to high dose inhaled corticosteroids / Long-acting beta-agonists (Part B)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is divided in 2 parts, A and B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A will be conducted in healthy adults, whereas Part B will be conducted in adult asthma&#xD;
      patients on medium/high dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)/long-acting beta-agonists (LABA)&#xD;
      to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and immunogenicity of AZD8630 by&#xD;
      dry powder inhaler (DPI) administration. Part A consists of single ascending dose (SAD) and&#xD;
      multiple ascending dose (MAD) cohorts in sequential order and Part B will be evaluating&#xD;
      multiple dose levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A: this part will consist 4 sub-parts and will include healthy participants and healthy&#xD;
      participants of Chinese and Japanese ethnicity. These participants will randomized to receive&#xD;
      AZD8630 and to receive placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sub-Part A1, SAD in healthy participants&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sub-Part A2, SAD in healthy participants of Chinese and Japanese ethnicity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sub-Part A3, MAD in healthy participants&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sub-Part A4, MAD in healthy participants of Chinese and Japanese ethnicity&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B: adult asthma patients will be randomized to one of 3 inhaled dose levels of AZD8630&#xD;
      or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected duration of study participation for each participants in the part A is up to 87&#xD;
      days, and each patients in the Part B is up to 70 days.&#xD;
