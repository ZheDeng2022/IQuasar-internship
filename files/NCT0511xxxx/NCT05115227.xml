  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Long-term approaches are challenging to implement within the current care system, which&#xD;
      rewards clinicians for attempting to quick-fix a long-term condition. This results in&#xD;
      increased inappropriate imaging, opioid prescriptions, surgery, and visits/rehabilitation in&#xD;
      secondary care, leading to higher societal costs and the continuing increase of LBP-related&#xD;
      disability that is currently observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators argue that LBP management can be optimized by providing patients with&#xD;
      self-management strategies supported by a multidisciplinary team and providing simple, safe,&#xD;
      and low-cost interventions that adhere to clinical guidelines. This has the potential to&#xD;
      change patient behaviors and facilitate empowerment to self-manage LBP leading to lower&#xD;
      societal costs of LBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will develop and test a long-term supportive multidisciplinary team-based&#xD;
      management strategy with a specific focus on communicating a structured and unchanging&#xD;
      message about individualized diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis, focusing on conducting a&#xD;
      large randomized controlled trial as the next phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This feasibility trial will be completed in a secondary care settings, where relevant&#xD;
      patients with poor management skills and insufficient effects of usual (primary) care&#xD;
      management can be identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (I) To develop a long-term supportive multidisciplinary team-based management strategy for&#xD;
      secondary-care low back pain patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      (II) To test the feasibility by assessing:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Changes in relevant outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Utilization of Primary care&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients and clinicians experience with the intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Practical challenges of the setting&#xD;
&#xD;
      The management strategy development follows the principles provided by the Medical Research&#xD;
      Council for developing complex interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Development of the framework&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 1: Framework setup&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators constructed a basic framework for the intervention by reviewing relevant&#xD;
      systematic reviews and clinical guidelines. The research group determined the initial&#xD;
      management intervention. Afterward, the investigators conducted a small survey on 191&#xD;
      participants (11% of the total sample of patients between February and May 2021), about their&#xD;
      interest in participating. The majority would find such an approach of interest (147(77%)).&#xD;
      In parallel, the investigators conducted short semi-structured interviews concerning the&#xD;
      intervention with a convenient sample of 20 patients. Seventeen provided usable data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 2 - Development&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the participants' information, the investigators re-framed the management strategy.&#xD;
      Subsequent semi-structured focus-group interviews with a clinical panel for further&#xD;
      modifications before testing was conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 3 - Feasibility&#xD;
&#xD;
      The multidisciplinary team for the feasibility trial consists of two coordinators&#xD;
      (chiropractors), two therapists (physical therapists), one medical doctor, and one nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The feasibility trial aims to identify and develop the appropriate framework by:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I) Investigating the patients' experiences of the current management strategy II) Ensuring&#xD;
      satisfactory work-relations between clinicians III) Determining the primary outcome IV)&#xD;
      Mapping the multiple interacting components of the management strategy V) Investigating how&#xD;
      to measure parallel use of primary care and how this could be applied in the trial evaluation&#xD;
      VI) Estimating the workload (number of hours) of the clinicians VII) Quantifying any&#xD;
      out-of-protocol behaviors by clinicians and patients alike VIII) Quantifying the different&#xD;
      aspects of the intervention using the clinical records&#xD;
&#xD;
      The feasibility trial will include 25 LBP patients from the Spine Centre willing to&#xD;
      participate in a limited three-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention procedure is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) A team meeting will be held each morning where the coordinator and the feasibility team&#xD;
      will go through the patients. This will start the initial sparring process to ensure a&#xD;
      structured and unchanging message for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The coordinator will first assess each patient face-to-face according to ICD-10 principles&#xD;
      and enroll eligible patients in the trial. Afterward, the therapist will evaluate the&#xD;
      patient's current functional status and management strategy. During the three months,&#xD;
      patients will have multiple encounters with the coordinator, the therapist, and the nurse, if&#xD;
      needed. The therapist will provide further interventions (e.g., exercise and&#xD;
      cognitive/behavioral therapy) to encourage self-management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will assess the following outcomes at three months: Disability (primary),&#xD;
      pain, self-efficacy, quality of life, LBP trajectory, workability, and work retention.&#xD;
