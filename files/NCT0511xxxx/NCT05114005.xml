  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Group dance classes have been found to improve markers of quality of life and physical health&#xD;
      (i.e., balance) among some populations engaged in rehabilitation, such as the elderly and&#xD;
      individuals with Parkinson Disease. However, such interventions have yet to be studied among&#xD;
      cancer survivors despite the relevance of quality of life and physical health within cancer&#xD;
      survivorship. Group dance classes are a promising avenue in that they deliver activity-based&#xD;
      medicine in a social context, thus potentially improving physical as well as psychosocial&#xD;
      aspects of health. To further this avenue of inquiry, we propose to study the effect of&#xD;
      dance-based interventions for cancer survivors.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be randomized (1:1) to one of two activity intervention arms: Argentine&#xD;
      Tango dance or home exercise. Information about neuropathy symptoms, motion, falls incidence,&#xD;
      and participant feedback about the interventions will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim1: To evaluate change in postural control over 16 sessions of Tango (exp) vs HEX (control)&#xD;
      (n=26 per group) as primary endpoint. As secondary measures, to assess: balance function&#xD;
      (i.e., TUG) and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) (i.e., symptoms, pain, fatigue, mood,&#xD;
      quality of life) monthly including 1 month post-intervention completion; postural control and&#xD;
      symptoms within-session; and falls incidence weekly for 6 months following intervention&#xD;
      completion. Hypothesis: At primary endpoint, participants in the experimental group will show&#xD;
      more improvement than participants in the control group in measures sensitive to neuropathy&#xD;
      disease state (i.e., sway variability and area).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim2: To evaluate change in gait variability after 16 sessions of Tango (exp) vs HEX&#xD;
      (control) (n=26 per group; 1:1 randomization). As secondary measures, to analyze local and&#xD;
      orbital dynamic stability (pre, post, and 1mo post-intervention), PROs (monthly), and falls&#xD;
      incidence (weekly) following intervention completion. Hypothesis: At primary endpoint,&#xD;
      participants in the experimental group will show more improvement than participants in the&#xD;
      control group in measures of gait variability (i.e., stride-to-stride variability in speed).&#xD;
