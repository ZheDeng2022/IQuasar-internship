    <textblock>
      The PLAN-V Study is an Ontario-based prospective, longitudinal study that will consist of&#xD;
      extensive biosampling and detailed data collection from pregnant women/individuals, who have&#xD;
      received the COVID-19 vaccine during their pregnancy, and their infants across the antenatal,&#xD;
      delivery and postpartum periods.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a pressing need for research to answer critical questions about the role of maternal&#xD;
      vaccination for protection of the mother-infant dyad, to inform public health recommendations&#xD;
      and to support evidence-based decision-making by Canadian families and their care providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' goal is to generate rapid, reliable evidence specific to the&#xD;
      immunogenicity and safety of COVID-19 vaccines in the pregnant population. The specific&#xD;
      PLAN-V Study objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccines in pregnant women/individuals and the&#xD;
           fetal/newborn immune response to maternal vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate safety of COVID-19 vaccination in pregnant women/individuals based on&#xD;
           obstetrical, fetal and newborn health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare immune responses to COVID-19 vaccination and natural COVID-19 disease among&#xD;
           pregnant women/individuals and their infants exposed in utero&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To compare the immune responses to COVID-19 vaccination between pregnant and&#xD;
           non-pregnant women/individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PLAN-V is an Ontario-based prospective, longitudinal study that will consist of extensive&#xD;
      biosampling and detailed data collection from pregnant women/individuals and their infants&#xD;
      across the prenatal, delivery and postpartum periods. With this approach, detailed&#xD;
      participant profiles will be generated that will enable us to explore vaccine reactogenicity;&#xD;
      vaccine-associated adverse events; frequency of obstetrical and fetal/newborn outcomes; and&#xD;
      measures of infant health and well-being. The study will build on existing resources and&#xD;
      expertise available through the COVID-19 Ontario Pregnancy Event (COPE) Network to establish&#xD;
      a prospective, longitudinal cohort study of pregnant women/individuals, and their infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PLAN-V Study will consist of pregnant women/individuals who are planning to receive a&#xD;
      COVID-19 vaccine(s) at any stage in pregnancy.&#xD;
