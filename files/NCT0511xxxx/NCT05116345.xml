  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, comparative, open-label, single-center, randomized,&#xD;
      investigator-sponsored clinical study and seeks to investigate clinical outcomes with&#xD;
      standard of care and high dose DEXTENZA treatment compared to standard of care topical&#xD;
      dexamethasone in patients undergoing trabeculectomy, trabeculectomy Ex-PRESS, Xen Gel stent,&#xD;
      and Ahmed Valve surgery. Patients will be followed through 6 months. After screening a given&#xD;
      patient for inclusion and exclusion criteria, and gaining informed consent, eyes of n=30&#xD;
      patients will be randomized to one of the following two groups (n=15per group) and followed&#xD;
      from Baseline through Month 6.&#xD;

    <description>Mean change in Visual Field (MD) will be detected using a perimeter device. The patient looks into the perimeter at a center target. Only one eye is tested at a time. The eye not being tested is covered with an eye patch. Small, dim lights will flash in the device and the patient will press a button each time they see the light. The results will show if the patient has had any changes in their visual field.</description>
