  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years there has been an increase in interest from surgeons in the use of synthetic&#xD;
      bone graft substitutes to avoid the need of sourcing allograft or iliac crest autograft for&#xD;
      use in spinal fusion procedures. This will be an open label, prospective, first in man,&#xD;
      single-centre clinical study to evaluate the safety and performance of Osteo3 ZP Putty&#xD;
      synthetic bone graft in TLIF procedures with instrumentation. Safety and performance data&#xD;
      obtained in this clinical study will be used to estimate clinical success rates achieved with&#xD;
      the use of Osteo3 ZP Putty synthetic bone graft in TLIF procedures. No comparative control&#xD;
      group is intended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is expected to run for approximately three years with each subject being followed&#xD;
      up for a two- year post-operative period. The target is to recruit approximately 17 subjects&#xD;
      to this clinical study, allowing for some subject attrition to get 15 evaluable.&#xD;

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Oswestry Disability Index questionnaire to assess Quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>3,6,12 and 24 months (unless fused at 12 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Validated off-the-shelf questionnaire asking patients questions about their ability to perform basic life tasks. It will be used to assess both the subject's back pain and how that pain affects the subject's ability to manage in everyday life. The questionnaire is divided into ten sections designed to assess limitations of various activities of daily living. Each section contains six statements and each statement describes a greater degree of difficulty in that activity than the preceding statement. Each section is scored on a 0-5 scale, 5 representing the greatest disability. The scores for all sections are added together, giving a possible score of 50. The total is doubled and expressed as a percentage.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analog Score to measure pain</measure>
    <time_frame>3,6,12 and 24 months (unless fused at 12 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Subject will score their pain from 0 to 100 by making a mark on a 10cm line where 0 = no pain and 100 = worst pain imaginable. The change in score from baseline (pre-surgical score) will be assessed at the time points below and reported as a percentage change.</description>

    <time_frame>3,6,12 and 24 months (unless fused at 12 months)</time_frame>
    <description>It will be used to assess both the subject's back pain and how that pain affects the subject's ability to manage in everyday life. The questionnaire is divided into eleven sections designed to assess limitations of various activities of daily living. Subject will score each section and the resulting scores are entered into a validated software evaluation tool which produces a result out of 100, allowing percentage change to be assessed from baseline (pre-surgical) score. Change in score will be assessed at the time points below and reported as a percentage change.</description>

The following scale will be used to assess muscle strength:&#xD;
No evidence of contractility 0 Slight contractility, no movement 1 Full range of motion, gravity eliminated (passive movement) 2 Full range of motion with gravity 3 Full range of motion against gravity, some resistance 4 Full range of motion against gravity, full resistance 5</description>
