  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urinary incontinence (UI) is defined as any involuntary loss of urine. It affects a&#xD;
      significant percentage of the population, mainly female, with a prevalence of 21.4% in&#xD;
      Portuguese women, having a negative impact on quality of life and sexual function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About half presents with stress UI (SUI), followed by mixed UI (MUI), with isolated urgency&#xD;
      UI being less common.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pelvic floor rehabilitiation is a first line treatment for SUI and MUI, however, it is not&#xD;
      yet defined which is the best treatment program or the ideal strategies to improve adherence&#xD;
      to it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telerehabilitation assumed a leading role in the covid pandemic phase, although there are few&#xD;
      studies on pelvic floor rehabilitation for UI, none in Portugal to date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The authors aim to evaluate the effectiveness of a hybrid program of pelvic floor&#xD;
      rehabilitation in female patients with SUI and MUI with a predominance of SUI, including&#xD;
      consultation and face-to-face sessions complemented with telerehabilitation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Randomized longitudinal study including consecutively admitted patients on pelvic floor&#xD;
      rehabilitation consultation of the Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Department of Centro&#xD;
      Hospitalar São João for conservative treatment of UI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who meet the inclusion criteria and do not meet any of the exclusion criteria will&#xD;
      be randomized one to one between the intervention group and the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group includes a hybrid program of face-to-face sessions followed by&#xD;
      sessions of video, while the control group develops the entire program in face-to-face&#xD;
      sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness of the program will be assessed by the results in the UI-related quality of&#xD;
      life (primary outcome); UI severity, patient's overall perception of improvement, sexual&#xD;
      function, depression/anxiety symptoms and satisfaction and adherence to treatment (secondary&#xD;
      outcomes).&#xD;

    <description>The intervention group includes a hybrid program of face-to-face sessions and video sessions. In the first consultation, a face-to-face one, patients will be instructed with behavioral and lifestyle measures and it will be prescribed a 12-week exercise program, including exercises to be performed three times a day and two weekly exercise sessions - three face-to-face sessions (2 initial and one at 8 weeks) and video sessions of 30 minutes, divided into 3 phases with gradual addition of exercises of increasing difficulty in terms of duration, number of repetitions and positions.&#xD;
In the middle of the treatment (at 6 weeks) a medical teleconsultation is performed for reassessment. In the end of the 12-week program there will also be a face-to-face consultation.</description>
