  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aluminum is a very abundant element in nature. Humans are exposed to this metal through the&#xD;
      environment, diet, and drinking water, as well as through the consumption of certain&#xD;
      medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aluminum is not an essential element for human, being able to become neurotoxic when it&#xD;
      reaches the brain once ingested at very high doses and, above all, if there is also kidney&#xD;
      dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Silicon is one of the most abundant elements on the planet and although it is not considered&#xD;
      an essential element for humans, some beneficial activities have been documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Silicon has been found to be readily available in food and that 41% of ingested silicon is&#xD;
      excreted in the urine, with a significant correlation between silicon ingested with food and&#xD;
      urinary silicon excretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most bioavailable silicon is that found in the form of silicic acid or orthosilicic acid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous studies suggest that silicon can reduce the oral absorption of aluminum and / or&#xD;
      improve its excretion and, therefore, protect against the adverse effects induced by the&#xD;
      ingestion of aluminum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a clinical study with healthy individuals as a control group for Alzheimer's disease, the&#xD;
      levels of aluminum excretion were analyzed after the continuous ingestion of water enriched&#xD;
      in silicon. The results in the first urine of the morning during the first week of ingestion&#xD;
      of the enriched water showed that the excretion of aluminum was 136.9 ± 81.4 µmol / nmol&#xD;
      creatinine while in the baseline week it was lower, 98.8 ± 64.3 nmol / nmol creatinine. These&#xD;
      results indicated that the Al excreted came from Al stored in the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of the consumption of three food&#xD;
      supplements formulated with different silicon compounds (monomethylsilanetriol and / or&#xD;
      silicic acid) on the urinary excretion of aluminum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the bioavailability of the silicon contained in three food supplements formulated with&#xD;
           different silicon compounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the effect of the consumption of three food supplements formulated with different&#xD;
           silicon compounds on urinary excretion of mercury, nickel, arsenic, cadmium, iron and&#xD;
           copper.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the safety of the consumption of three food supplements formulated with different&#xD;
           silicon compounds.&#xD;

      It will be conducted a single-center, randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trial&#xD;
      with four groups in parallel (placebo, Supplement A, Supplement B and Supplement C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be carried out with a total of 40 individuals (10 individuals per group), men&#xD;
      and women aged 40 to 65 years. Individuals will have normal serum creatinine levels: up to&#xD;
      1.1mg/dl in women and up to 1.4mg/dl in men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigational products involved in this study are four food supplements made from&#xD;
      silicon compounds and the corresponding placebos.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will receive a kit containing a bottle with 10 capsules and a bottle of 100&#xD;
      ml of liquid according to the treatments corresponding to the randomly assigned group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, the volunteers will consume one capsule and 100ml of product each day for 7&#xD;
      days. The first morning urine will be collected during the 7 days of treatment and also&#xD;
      during the previous 7 days to analyze the baseline values. In addition, on days 6 and 7 of&#xD;
      the study, the urine will be collected in three fractions up to 24h to evaluate the&#xD;
      bioavailability of silicon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will make a total of 5 visits, including the pre-selection visit. In these&#xD;
      visits, the following will be carried out: Revision of Inclusion and exclusion criteria;&#xD;
      Informed consent signature;Safety biochemistry; Demographic variables (age, sex),&#xD;
      anthropometric variables; Evaluation of dietary intake; Randomization; Delivery of the&#xD;
      sampling material; Verification of compliance with dietary requirements; Collection of urine&#xD;
      samples; Investigation product delivery; Determination of metals in urine; Registration of&#xD;
      Medication and food supplements; concomitants adverse event registry.&#xD;
