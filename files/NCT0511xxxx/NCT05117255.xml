  <brief_summary>

      This project is designed to determine if a computer-delivered cognitive-behavioral treatment&#xD;
      can improve the otherwise poor alcohol use disorder treatment outcomes for individuals with a&#xD;
      co-occurring anxiety disorder. In the past, we showed that this treatment does improve&#xD;
      outcomes for these individuals when delivered by a therapist. If the present work shows that&#xD;
      the computer-delivered version is also effective, it would provide an inexpensive program&#xD;
      with virtually unlimited scalability to enable access to the treatment by many more&#xD;
      individuals than is currently the case.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The broad goal of the proposed work is to conduct a randomized controlled trial of a&#xD;
      specialized computer-delivered cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to supplement standard&#xD;
      alcohol use disorder (AUD) treatment in patients with a co-occurring anxiety disorder&#xD;
      (&quot;comorbidity&quot;). Comorbidity is both common in AUD treatment patients (up to 50%) and confers&#xD;
      a substantial increase in the risk of a return to drinking in the months following treatment.&#xD;
      Because research shows that simply adding a standard psychiatric treatment does not&#xD;
      substantially improve the AUD outcomes of comorbid individuals, we developed a CBT-based&#xD;
      intervention aimed at disrupting the positive-feedback loop (&quot;vicious cycle&quot;; VC) of mutually&#xD;
      aggravating negative affect and drinking behavior/urges (the &quot;VC-CBT&quot;). In an Randomized&#xD;
      Controlled Trial (RCT), AUD treatment patients who received the therapist-delivered VC-CBT&#xD;
      demonstrated significantly improved alcohol use outcomes as compared to those who received a&#xD;
      standard anxiety treatment. Unfortunately, most community-based AUD treatment programs do not&#xD;
      have clinical staff with the specialized training and technical expertise needed to deliver&#xD;
      the VC-CBT. To help bridge this &quot;research-to-practice&quot; gap, we went on to develop a fully&#xD;
      autonomous and interactive computer-delivered version of the VC-CBT and have demonstrated its&#xD;
      functionality in AUD patients. Now, we propose to test the clinical efficacy of the&#xD;
      computer-delivered VC-CBT, as well as the mechanisms and processes by which it is&#xD;
      hypothesized to work. Aim I is a randomized controlled trial comparing the computer-delivered&#xD;
      VC-CBT to an intensity-matched computer-delivered active control intervention that focuses on&#xD;
      healthy lifestyles. 256 individuals in residential AUD treatment who have a comorbid anxiety&#xD;
      disorder will receive either the VC-CBT or the active control intervention to obtain 200&#xD;
      cases that complete a 1-, 4- and 8-month follow-up. We predict the VC-CBT group will&#xD;
      demonstrate superior alcohol-related outcomes at follow-up relative to the control group. Aim&#xD;
      II evaluates the extent to which the computer-delivered VC-CBT selectively imparts the skills&#xD;
      targeted and whether they convey (mediate) the interventions therapeutic effect. This entails&#xD;
      a formal series of &quot;causal steps&quot; analyses of the associations of: treatment-&gt;skills;&#xD;
      skills-&gt;outcomes; and, treatment -&gt; outcomes, with vs. without the effect of skills-&gt;outcomes&#xD;
      statistically controlled. Aim III will test the theoretically-derived prediction that the&#xD;
      computer-delivered VC-CBT moderates (i.e., weakens) the association of near real-time&#xD;
      negative affect and negative situations with drinking behavior and drinking urges. This will&#xD;
      be accomplished by analyzing a series of electronic Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA)&#xD;
      recordings completed in participants' natural environment in each of the 30 days following&#xD;
      the conclusion of treatment. The impact of this work would be to provide a scalable and&#xD;
      inexpensive means of improving the otherwise poor AUD treatment outcomes of comorbid AUD&#xD;
      treatment patients. The work will also provide new scientific knowledge about the mechanisms&#xD;
      and processes of change stemming from comorbidity treatment.&#xD;
