  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open-label, randomized, 2-arm, within-arm cross-over study designed&#xD;
      to evaluate elements of abuse liability (AL) including subjective effects and physiological&#xD;
      measures (pharmacodynamics [PD]), and plasma nicotine uptake (pharmacokinetics [PK]) during&#xD;
      and following ad libitum use of the study investigational products (IPs) by generally healthy&#xD;
      smokers.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Smokers of both non-menthol and menthol combustible cigarettes (CC) will be recruited into&#xD;
      this AL study to evaluate elements of AL of four heated tobacco products (HTP) (hereinafter,&#xD;
      HTP investigational products [IPs]) compared to combustible cigarette (CC) and nicotine&#xD;
      polacrilex gum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential subjects may complete a pre-screening telephone interview. They will complete a&#xD;
      Screening Visit to assess their eligibility within 45 days prior to check-in (inclusive of&#xD;
      enrollment/randomization) and to determine their assignment to either Study Arm 1&#xD;
      (non-menthol smokers) or Study Arm 2 (menthol smokers). Enrollment and clinical conduct for&#xD;
      each of the two Study Arms will occur sequentially.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting on Day 1, subjects will check-in at the study site to complete procedures to confirm&#xD;
      eligibility. Eligible subjects will be enrolled into the appropriate Study Arm and confined&#xD;
      for either 11 days (Study Arm 1) or 13 days (Study Arm 2). Based on their Study Arm&#xD;
      assignment, subjects will be randomized to a product use sequence (using a Williams Design)&#xD;
      in which they will evaluate one IP in each Test Session, including both a high-AL comparator&#xD;
      (subject's usual brand [UB] cigarette) and a low-AL comparator (a commercially available&#xD;
      nicotine replacement therapy [NRT] nicotine gum). In addition to the AL-comparators, Study&#xD;
      Arm 1 will evaluate three HTP IPs (i.e., 5 Test Sessions) and Study Arm 2 will evaluate four&#xD;
      HTP IPs (i.e., 6 Test Sessions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 and continuing through Day 11 (Study Arm 1) or Day 13 (Study Arm 2), subjects will&#xD;
      participate in Test Sessions that will last for approximately 4 hours. Each Test Session will&#xD;
      include collection of both PD measures (subjective and physiological) and PK measures prior&#xD;
      to, during and following IP use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a 1.5-day Product Acclimation Period prior to each Test Session. During the&#xD;
      Product Acclimation Period, subjects will be permitted ad libitum use of randomized IP for&#xD;
      familiarization prior to use in the next Test Session, as well as ad libitum smoking of their&#xD;
      UB cigarettes.&#xD;
