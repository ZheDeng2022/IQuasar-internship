  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, active comparator-controlled phase Ⅲ trial&#xD;
      using non-inferior design. A total of 188 patients with breast cancer who are suitable for&#xD;
      endocrine therapy will be enrolled into the screening period from D-28 to D-1 before&#xD;
      administration. Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive LY01005 3.6 mg&#xD;
      intramuscularly or ZOLADEX ® 3.6 mg subcutaneously once every 28 days for three doses until&#xD;
      intolerable toxicity, disease progression requiring other anti-tumor treatments, withdrawal&#xD;
      of consent, loss to follow-up, death or the end of the whole study, and stratified according&#xD;
      to history of chemotherapy (yes vs. no) and age (&lt;45 vs. ≥45 years old). And all subjects&#xD;
      will be also treated with tamoxifen orally twice per day (10 mg/tablet, 1 tablet/time). Blood&#xD;
      samples will be collected at the specified time points of the study to detect serum E2, LH&#xD;
      and FSH. Safety evaluation (including vital signs, physical examination, laboratory tests, 12&#xD;
      ECG, adverse events, etc.) will be conducted as required in the protocol. Additional blood&#xD;
      samples will be collected from 12 subjects (PK subgroup) who are randomized to LY01005 group&#xD;
      to assess the PK and PD characteristics of LY01005 in patients with breast cancer.&#xD;
