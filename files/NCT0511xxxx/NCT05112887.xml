    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to determine the efficacy of a treatment method that increase a&#xD;
      participants sense of smell after suffering from COVID-19 related decline in smell.&#xD;
      Participants have to be greater than 14 days from positive COVID-19 test and still have a&#xD;
      decreased sense of smell. https://jaoa.org/article.aspx?articleid=2765119 this article is a&#xD;
      review of literature regarding why OMT can have a positive effect on individuals suffering&#xD;
      from COVID-19&#xD;

      The goal of this project will be to determine if OMT can return the sense of smell to&#xD;
      participants who previously contracted COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have to email a positive COVID-19 test result &gt;14 days prior to&#xD;
      MS861918@ohio.edu. There will be a correspondence with the participant to ask them if they&#xD;
      feel their sense is still decreased or absent and then candidacy for study will be&#xD;
      determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      20 participants will be divided randomly into sham OMT treatment groups and real OMT&#xD;
      treatments. 10 in each group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will rate on a scale of 0-10 (0 being no smell, and 10 being pre-COVID19&#xD;
      exposure smell) the ability to smell the following items blindfolded pre-treatment as well as&#xD;
      attempt to identify the substance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      These will be performed with&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Perfume&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Red Onion (sliced)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Bourbon&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Orange&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the sham treatment group will receive a non-osteopathic approach to&#xD;
      treatment, which will consist of general palpation of head/neck/shoulder region. Participants&#xD;
      in the Osteopathic Manipulation Therapy (OMT) group will receive:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rib raising&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Suboccipital Release&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Thoracic Inlet Release&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Miller Thoracic Pump&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pedal Pump&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cranial OMT, Performed Indirect Vault hold at conclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stevan Walkowski, D.O. will be providing treatment to both the OMT and Sham group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will rate on a scale of 0-10 (0 being no smell, and 10 being pre-COVID19&#xD;
      exposure smell) to smell the following items blindfolded pre-treatment as well as attempt to&#xD;
      identify the substance 10 min post-treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Perfume&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Red Onion (sliced)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Bourbon&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Orange&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be debriefed following the research procedure. They will be informed of&#xD;
      potential side effects that is listed in the risks or discomfort category and will be&#xD;
      encouraged to drink water following treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Side effects from sham treatment group: Frustration of not re-acquiring sense of smell&#xD;
&#xD;
      Side effects from OMT treatment group: Headache, dizziness, increase secretion (diarrhea,&#xD;
      diuresis) from increase in fluid flow, frustration of not re-acquiring sense of smell&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in both groups will be told of the side effects of the OMT treatment group and&#xD;
      will be encouraged to drink water following treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits from sham treatment group: none&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits from OMT treatment group: May have an increase sense of smell post-treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple post-COVID19 individuals who lost sense of smell continue to have a decrease sense&#xD;
      of smell after surviving the illness. These people have a decreased ability to smell food,&#xD;
      drinks and enjoy shared human experiences which can lead to isolation. Individuals who have a&#xD;
      decrease sense of smell are also in increased danger due to not being able to smell hazardous&#xD;
      events around them i.e. smoke from a fire, gas filling their house from a leaking gas stove,&#xD;
      spoiled food etc..&#xD;

    <description>Participants in the sham/placebo group were lightly touched in equivalent positions to the OMT treatments. First, sham participants were lightly touched on the thoracic cage while seated, followed by light touch of the neck, chest, feet, and cranium while supine. The length of light touch was modeled after the approximate time needed for the OMT matching each treatment region. Each treatment sequence lasted about 20 minutes in total.</description>
