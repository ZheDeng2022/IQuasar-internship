  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer is the most prevalent cancer and the third cancer related death in Taiwan.&#xD;
      Adenoma is a precancerous lesion of colorectal cancer. Using colonoscopy to detect and remove&#xD;
      the adenoma has a chance to prevent colorectal cancer development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the resection of colorectal polyps, for medium and large polyps that are more than one&#xD;
      centimeter and less than two centimeters, because these polyps are at risk of cancer, they&#xD;
      currently use hot-snaring polypectomy or more advanced endoscopic mucosal resection.&#xD;
      Resection of such tumors ensures that a sufficient depth of resection and a high complete&#xD;
      resection rate (R0 resection) are achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flat serrated adenoma (sessile serrated lesion) is a special adenoma that accounts for 10-12%&#xD;
      of all colorectal polyps. Different from traditional adenomas, flat serrated adenomas within&#xD;
      two centimeters in size have very little chance of becoming cancerous. And we know that on&#xD;
      removal of medium and large polyps of 10-20mm, compared with the cold snaring polypectomy,&#xD;
      the postoperative bleeding of the hot-snaring polypectomy technique is higher. Therefore,&#xD;
      when removing low-risk polyps such as flat serrated adenomas, we may choose using a&#xD;
      non-energized technique with low complications and we then would like to know whether the&#xD;
      complete resection rate can be achieved by using the non-energized technique in the resection&#xD;
      of a flat serrated adenoma of 10-20 mm, despite the large size, and compare the success rate&#xD;
      and complications with traditional hot snaring polypectomy.&#xD;

      This study is a single-country, multi-center, randomized controlled study. The subjects of&#xD;
      the case were patients who underwent colonoscopy for various indications and found flat&#xD;
      serrated adenomas ranging in size from 10-20 mm during the procedure. Excluded criterias are&#xD;
      patients who are younger than 20 years old and have contraindications for colonoscopy. All&#xD;
      patients included in the study will sign the informed consent sheet at the outpatient clinic.&#xD;
      Once a flat serrated adenoma with a size of 10-20 mm is found during colonoscopy, the&#xD;
      subjects will be randomly assigned to Cold snaring polypectomy group, cold endoscopic mucosal&#xD;
      resection group or hot endoscopic mucosal resection group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The preoperative preparation for bowel cleansing and colonoscope insertion method for these&#xD;
      three groups of patients are totally the same as those of general colonoscopy. The only&#xD;
      difference is the resection method flat serrated glands of 10-20 mm. The tumor was resected&#xD;
      by cold snaring polypectomy, one group was resected by cold endoscopic mucosal resection, and&#xD;
      the other group was resected by hot endoscopic mucosal resection. The endoscopists&#xD;
      participating in this research project have extensive experience in endoscopy and perform at&#xD;
      least one hundred polypectomy operations every year. The excised tumor will be sent to the&#xD;
      pathology department for pathological diagnosis, and the pathology doctor will judge the&#xD;
      completeness of the tumor resection&#xD;
