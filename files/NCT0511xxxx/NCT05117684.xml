  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      DIPSS has become a widely accepted treatment for complications of portal hypertension. Shunt&#xD;
      or hepatic vein stenosis are common short and mid term complications of the procedure. When&#xD;
      identified early, shunt stenosis or occlusion may be treated before recurrence of the&#xD;
      symptoms for which DIPSS was done at the first place. Present day endovascular DIPSS revision&#xD;
      techniques have significantly improved the primary assisted patency rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to understand the newer technique of Combined balloon occlusion&#xD;
      thrombolysis and intra stent balloon sweeping being practiced at our institute and compare it&#xD;
      with the widely used conventional thrombolytic methods.&#xD;

      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To study the outcome of combined technique of Balloon occluded thrombolysis, Balloon&#xD;
           sweeping and maceration of thrombus in Blocked DIPSS stent and compare it with&#xD;
           Conventional catheter directed thrombolysis and angioplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study DIPSS stent patency and re-occlusion rates at 1 month followup&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Patients with Budd -Chiari syndrome who underwent DIPSS revision till&#xD;
      February 2021&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Single center retrospective cohort study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study period: 1year&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: All eligible patients according to inclusion and exclusion criteria who&#xD;
      underwent TIPS/DIPS revision will be included in thestudy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: DIPSS Revision&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring andassessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following parameters to be evaluated over a period at least 1 month after DIPSS revision&#xD;
      and compare with pre revisionvalues&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Status of ascites Urine output Recurrence of UGI/LGI bleed&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ALBI Score,LFT, KFT&#xD;
&#xD;
      DOPPLER PARAMETERS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mid stent velocity, velocity at hepatic venous end Main portal vein velocity Direction of&#xD;
      flow in intrahepatic portal vein branches&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stopping rule: Not applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcome of the project: Balloon Occluded thrombolytic infusion alongwith intratsent&#xD;
      balloon sweeping gives faster and better patency as compared to conventional&#xD;
      pharmaco-mechanicalthrombolytic methods&#xD;
