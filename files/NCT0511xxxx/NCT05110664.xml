      A double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept study using oral peptide&#xD;
      YY3-36 solution to investigate the mechanistic role of lingual PYY in regulating appetite,&#xD;
      energy intake and food preference in people with overweight/obesity. The aim of this study is&#xD;
      to investigate the mechanistic role of lingual PYY in regulating appetite, energy intake and&#xD;
      food preference in people with overweight/obesity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to address the study objective two independent investigations in two separate groups&#xD;
      of participants will need to be undertaken, to avoid cross-contamination of the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Cohort/Investigation 1: A randomised within-subject double-blind cross-over&#xD;
           placebo-controlled study to investigate the role of lingual PYY in regulating fasted and&#xD;
           post-meal appetite following a fixed energy intake meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cohort/Investigation 2: A randomised within-subject double-blind cross-over&#xD;
           placebo-controlled study to investigate the role of lingual PYY in regulating ad libitum&#xD;
           energy intake and food preference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with overweight or obesity (BMI 25.0-39.9 kg/m2), identified via the University&#xD;
      College London Hospitals (UCLH) Bariatric Centre for Weight Management and Metabolic Surgery&#xD;
      and through advertising via University College London (UCL) and ULCH, will be invited to take&#xD;
      part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants will initially attend a screening visit, where informed, written&#xD;
      consent will first be taken. During the screening visit, medical, drug and dietary histories&#xD;
      will be taken and participant eligibility will be confirmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will attend on two separate occasions at least 7 days apart for both&#xD;
      cohort/investigation 1 and cohort/investigation 2. 20 participants per cohort/investigation&#xD;
      will be randomised (in a 1:1 manner), stratified by sex, to receive either oral PYY3-36&#xD;
      solution or matched placebo at their first study visit. Participants will be recruited onto&#xD;
      study/investigation 1 first and once this is complete, new subjects will be enrolled onto&#xD;
      study/investigation 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort/Intervention 1: The day prior to each visit participants will complete a 24 hour food&#xD;
      diary and appetite scores at home. Participants will fast overnight (12 hours) and consume&#xD;
      only water until reaching the clinical facility the following morning. Participants will need&#xD;
      to refrain from exercise for 2 days prior to the study visits and from drinking alcohol. On&#xD;
      arrival, medical history will be re-reviewed, sociodemographic information collected and a&#xD;
      pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential will be performed. Body weight and&#xD;
      composition will be measured. Baseline assessments of fasted subjective appetite assessed&#xD;
      using validated visual analogue scales (VAS), saliva PYY levels (via saliva sample) and&#xD;
      circulating gut hormones (via blood sample) will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single dose of lingual PYY (GT-001) or placebo will be administered. Appetite scores and a&#xD;
      paired blood and saliva sample will be collected 10-15 minutes later. 30 minutes after study&#xD;
      drug application, participants will then be asked to consume a standardised fixed meal over&#xD;
      15 minutes using established protocol and appetite scores (VAS) and saliva and blood samples&#xD;
      will be taken for 180 minutes post-meal at regular intervals. Participants will be asked to&#xD;
      complete 24-hour food diary and appetite scores 6, 12 and 24 hours after the study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort/Intervention 2: The day prior to each study visit participants will complete a 24-hour&#xD;
      food diary and appetite scores at home. Participants will fast overnight (12 hours) and&#xD;
      consume only water until reaching the clinical facility the following morning. Participants&#xD;
      will need to refrain from exercise for 2 days prior to the study visits and from drinking&#xD;
      alcohol. On arrival, medical history will be re-reviewed, sociodemographic information&#xD;
      collected and a pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential will be performed. Body&#xD;
      weight and composition will be measured. Baseline assessments of fasted subjective appetite&#xD;
      assessed using validated VAS, saliva PYY levels (via saliva sample) and circulating gut&#xD;
      hormones (via blood sample) will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single dose of lingual PYY (GT-001) or placebo will be administered. Appetite scores and a&#xD;
      paired blood and saliva sample will be collected 10-15 minutes later. 30 minutes after study&#xD;
      drug application, participants will be offered an extensive free-choice buffet lunch and&#xD;
      asked to eat until full. Ad libitum energy intake and food preferences will be assessed.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to rank likeness of the items of the buffet. Appetite scores (VAS)&#xD;
      and paired blood and saliva sample will be taken again 60 minutes from the onset of the meal.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to complete 24-hour food diary and appetite scores 24 hours after&#xD;
      the study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a 7-day washout period participants in each cohort/intervention will be crossed-over&#xD;
      and the same visit will be repeated. Both the participants and researchers will be blinded to&#xD;
      the study condition.&#xD;
