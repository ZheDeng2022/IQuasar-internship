      The purpose of this study is to compare the positive and negative effects of Dex4® tablets,&#xD;
      as an alternative form of fast acting carbohydrate, compared to the current standard&#xD;
      diagnostic test, glucose beverage. The investigators hypothesis that because of their&#xD;
      availability in solid, chewable form, variety of flavours and lack of carbonation, Dex4®&#xD;
      tablets may result in fewer side effects than glucose beverage and provide an equivalent&#xD;
      carbohydrate challenge for diagnosis of gestational diabetes.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The project is a population-based, prospective randomized crossover study. Women who fall&#xD;
      into the screen positive group of the 50g GCT (1 hour serum glucose of 7.8-11 mmol/L) will be&#xD;
      offered participation in the study. 28 participants will be recruited and will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned using a pre-populated allocation table to take either the standard OGTT test (75g of&#xD;
      glucose beverage) first or the alternative OGTT test (21 Dex4® tablets) first. The first test&#xD;
      will be referred to as OGTT-1 and the second test will be referred to as OGTT-2. After&#xD;
      completing OGTT-1 at the first test appointment, a questionnaire about pregnancy, health,&#xD;
      diet and exercise habits, and side effects from the first test will be completed by the&#xD;
      participant (Questionnaire A). After completing OGTT-2 at their second test appointment, a&#xD;
      questionnaire about side effects from the second test and test preference will be completed&#xD;
      by the participant (Questionnaire B). Each woman will complete both tests within one week and&#xD;
      each subject will serve as their own control. Results will be kept blinded in the case report&#xD;
      forms until both OGTT tests are done. Serum glucose will be measured using the same&#xD;
      internationally standardised glucose-oxidase method (RocheDiagnosis) in the Sunnybrook&#xD;
      Biochemistry lab. After serum glucose measurement, all results will be sent to the research&#xD;
      team but only the standard of care glucose beverage test data will appear in electronic (or&#xD;
      classical) medical records and be used for GDM diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant population consists of 28 pregnant women between 24-28 weeks' gestation who&#xD;
      have screened positive for gestational diabetes on the 50g glucose challenge test. The main&#xD;
      drawback to participation is that women will have to undergo two fasting, 1 hour and 2 hour&#xD;
      glucose values within one week. Risks involved with participating in the study include:&#xD;
      possibility of pain, bruising, swelling or infection related to drawing blood, allergic&#xD;
      reaction symptoms such as itching, facial swelling and anaphylaxis upon consumption if the&#xD;
      participant has an allergy to corn based products such as dextrose. These risks will be&#xD;
      minimized by screening patients for dextrose allergy before having them sign the informed&#xD;
      consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The benefit may not be directly to the patient as they will still need to complete the&#xD;
      standard 75g glucose beverage test but they will be contributing to new knowledge on&#xD;
      alternatives to the standard test that may benefit other pregnant women, including&#xD;
      themselves, in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ultimate goal of this project is to improve women's health by 1) allowing more women to&#xD;
      be screened for GDM and 2) providing an equivalent glucose beverage alternative with fewer&#xD;
      side effects, making the screening process more comfortable for patients who cannot tolerate&#xD;
      glucose beverage. Improving the tolerability of the test is important because there is&#xD;
      growing evidence that GDM significantly increases the risk of short and long term adverse&#xD;
      consequences for both the fetus and the mother (10,11). Accurate diagnosis may allow women to&#xD;
      implement preventative measures such as a healthy lifestyle, which has shown to be effective&#xD;
      in preventing T2DM in women with previous GDM (19,20). There have been recent quality control&#xD;
      issues with the commercially available glucose beverage product (16), so this alternative&#xD;
      test could become the standard test if the dose calibration is found to be more reliable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective 1 (PO-1): to determine if Dex4® tablets is equivalent to glucose beverage&#xD;
      for use in the 2-hr 75g OGTT in pregnant women between 24-30 weeks gestation who have&#xD;
      screened positive for GDM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective (SO-1): to determine if women have fewer side effects and prefer the&#xD;
      standard (glucose beverage) OGTT test or the alternative (Dex4® tablets) OGTT test&#xD;
