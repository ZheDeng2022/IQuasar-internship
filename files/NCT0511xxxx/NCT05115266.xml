  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Animal-assisted therapy (AAT) is a complementary intervention of therapy that has shown&#xD;
      positive results in the treatment of various pathologies. This study assesses the viability&#xD;
      of the implementation and the effectiveness of an AAT program in patients diagnosed with&#xD;
      borderline personality disorder and substance abuse disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypotheses are that participation in the TAA program will reduce negative symptoms,&#xD;
      improve the quality of life of people with dual pathology, whose mental illness is&#xD;
      schizophrenia, and increase adherence to treatment for people with dual pathology, whose&#xD;
      mental disorder it's schizophrenia.&#xD;
