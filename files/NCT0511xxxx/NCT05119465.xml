  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, 195 million people have been infected and 4.2&#xD;
      million have died from the disease or its side-effects. Physicians, healthcare scientists and&#xD;
      medical staff continuously try to deal with overloaded hospital admissions, while in&#xD;
      parallel, they try to identify meaningful correlations between the severity of infected&#xD;
      patients with their symptoms, comorbidities and biomarkers. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and&#xD;
      Machine Learning (ML) have been used recently in many areas related to COVID-19 healthcare.&#xD;
      The main goal is to manage effectively the wide variety of issues related to COVID-19 and its&#xD;
      consequences. The existing applications of ML to COVID-19 healthcare are based on supervised&#xD;
      classification which require a labeled training dataset, serving as reference point for&#xD;
      learning, as well as predefined classes. However, the existing knowledge about COVID-19 and&#xD;
      its consequences is still not solid and the points of common agreement among different&#xD;
      scientific communities are still unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this study aimed to follow an unsupervised clustering approach, where prior&#xD;
      knowledge is not required (tabula rasa).&#xD;
&#xD;
      More specifically, 268 hospitalized patients at the First Propaedeutic Department of Internal&#xD;
      Medicine of AHEPA University Hospital of Thessaloniki were assessed in terms of 40 clinical&#xD;
      variables (numerical and categorical), leading to a high-dimensionality dataset.&#xD;
      Dimensionality reduction was performed by applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the&#xD;
      numerical part of the dataset and Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) on the categorical&#xD;
      part of the dataset. Then, the Bayesian Information Criterion(BIC) was applied to Gaussian&#xD;
      Mixture Models (GMM) in order to identify the optimal number of clusters, under which, the&#xD;
      best grouping of patients occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed methodology identified 4 clusters of patients with similar clinical&#xD;
      characteristics. The analysis revealed a cluster of asymptomatic patients that resulted in&#xD;
      death at a rate of 23.8%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This striking result forces us to reconsider the relationship between the severity of&#xD;
      COVID-19 clinical symptoms and patient's mortality.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An algorithmic pipeline based on unsupervised machine learning algorithms, which aims to&#xD;
      operate in tandem with physicians and provide additional knowledge for the proper&#xD;
      categorization of COVID-19 infected patients based on their severity, is proposed in this&#xD;
      study. Data from patients hospitalized in our clinic are collected and stored in separate&#xD;
      Microsoft Excel files (.xlsx), which are loaded into memory. A script is concatenating them&#xD;
      all into a single dataframe where they are checked for NaN (Not a Number) values. Because of&#xD;
      the nature of the data, patients with missing information are discarded entirely from the&#xD;
      dataset, since information inference would be a biased practice for the particular&#xD;
      application. Next, we apply data normalization by scaling all numerical variables between the&#xD;
      (0,1) range, so that the range of all numerical variables is the same, and any bias towards&#xD;
      certain variables is avoided .A thorough and detailed data collection process was designed in&#xD;
      order to collect information for the patients, without disturbing the clinical treatment, or&#xD;
      upsetting them in the process.&#xD;
