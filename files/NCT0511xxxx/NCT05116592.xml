      Lower urinary tract symptoms caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) are the most common&#xD;
      urological problem among men. monopolar transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), in&#xD;
      which the enlarged prostate tissue is resected piece by piece using a monopolar electrode,&#xD;
      has been the gold standard since the 1970s. It can substantially improve the maximal flow&#xD;
      rate (Qmax), urinary symptoms (International Prostate Symptom Score, IPSS), and&#xD;
      health-related quality of life (QOL), with long-term efficacy compared to medications or&#xD;
      other minimally invasive treatments.4 5 However, monopolar TURP is a risky procedure because&#xD;
      of the likelihood of severe complications such as massive bleeding or transurethral resection&#xD;
      (TUR) syndrome.6 Therefore, it is of paramount importance to develop minimally invasive&#xD;
      surgical techniques with outcomes similar to those of monopolar TURP, but with fewer side&#xD;
      effects. Therefore, new energy system with different surgical methods developed after 2000s.&#xD;
      Among all, Enucleation methods was proved to have better Qmax and IPSS after surgery than&#xD;

      important issues. The study using prospective cohort design recruit 300 BPH patient receiving&#xD;
      enucleation methods. To investigate the risk factors of transient incontinence and establish&#xD;
      model to predict the incontinence. Besides we will evaluate different surgical methods and&#xD;

      Lower urinary tract symptoms caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) are the most common&#xD;
      urological problem among men. Approximately one-third of men over the age of 50 are affected&#xD;
      by this problem. Surgical intervention is the most effective treatment for BPH, with around&#xD;
      100,000 procedures carried out annually in the United States. Of all surgical treatments,&#xD;
      monopolar transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), in which the enlarged prostate&#xD;
      tissue is resected piece by piece using a monopolar electrode, has been the gold standard&#xD;
      since the 1970s. It can substantially improve the maximal flow rate (Qmax), urinary symptoms&#xD;
      (International Prostate Symptom Score, IPSS), and health-related quality of life (QOL), with&#xD;
      long-term efficacy compared to medications or other minimally invasive treatments. However,&#xD;
      monopolar TURP is a risky procedure because of the likelihood of severe complications such as&#xD;
      massive bleeding or transurethral resection (TUR) syndrome. Therefore, it is of paramount&#xD;
      importance to develop minimally invasive surgical techniques with outcomes similar to those&#xD;
      of monopolar TURP, but with fewer side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the 2000s, new energy systems for BPH surgical interventions quickly became popular,&#xD;
      including systems that use bipolar energy and various laser systems, such as the holmium&#xD;
      laser, potassium-titanyl-phosphate (KTP) laser, thulium laser, and diode laser. The trend in&#xD;
      BPH surgical therapy has shifted from monopolar TURP to laser therapies and bipolar TURP over&#xD;
      the past 10 years. Bipolar energy can be used to incise, resect, and vaporize prostate tissue&#xD;
      using different electrodes. Holmium and thulium laser beams are mainly absorbed by water and&#xD;
      act as incisional lasers. The KTP laser is selectively absorbed by hemoglobin and debulks&#xD;
      prostate tissue through vaporization. The diode laser is absorbed by water and hemoglobin can&#xD;
      therefore vaporize and incise prostate tissue. These new methods all use normal saline&#xD;
      instead of distilled water to avoid hyponatremia. They can be further divided into three&#xD;
      types according to their treatment principles: resection methods (resection of prostate&#xD;
      tissue piece by piece), vaporization methods (vaporization of excessive prostate tissue), and&#xD;
      enucleation methods (peeling the enlarged prostate from the prostate capsule).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enucleation methods was proved to have better Qmax and IPSS after surgery than vaporization&#xD;
      and resection methods. In a network meta-analysis, enucleation methods, including bipolar&#xD;
      enucleation of prostate , holmium, thulium, and diode laser enucleation of prostate, yielded&#xD;
      greater Qmax values at 6-12-months after surgery than did the resection and vaporization&#xD;
      methods, and the difference could still be observed at 24-36 months after treatment. The&#xD;
      advantages of the enucleation over vaporization methods were mainly observed in large&#xD;
      prostates. Enucleation methods also achieved better IPSS than resection and vaporization&#xD;
      methods, although the difference was not statistically significant. The new methods were&#xD;
      generally safer than monopolar TURP. They were less likely to require patient transfusion,&#xD;
      cause blood clot tamponade, lead to postoperative hemoglobin decline, or cause TUR syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the risk of short-term transient incontinence was higher in enucleation than in&#xD;
      resection methods. Compared with resection methods, enucleation methods had more events of&#xD;
      short-term transient urinary incontinence than resection methods. (odds ratio (OR)=1.91, 95%&#xD;
      Confidence interval (CI); 1.35 to 2.71) Liu et al compared bipolar enucleation with bipolar&#xD;
      TURP and found that after Foley removal, the incontinence rate was higher in enucleation than&#xD;
      in resection at 24 hours (35.6 % vs 18.9%, p&lt;0.01) and one week (20% vs 7.8%, p&lt;0.05).28&#xD;
      There was no difference after two weeks postoperatively (3.3% vs 2.2 % at 2 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Xu et al retrospectively reviewed 1288 patient receiving bipolar enucleation and found that&#xD;
      older age and large prostate volume were associated with postoperative stress urinary&#xD;
      incontinence. Besides, operation time and blood loss were also reported as risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence many authors used modified methods such as upside down, apical preservation methods,&#xD;
      defining the limits of dissection proximal to external sphincter prior to enucleation, in&#xD;
      order to reduce postoperative urinary incontinence. Besides pelvic floor exercise was&#xD;
      demonstrated to shorten the periods of stress urinary incontinence. However, the role of&#xD;
      pelvic floor exercise in enucleation methods in BPH patients are unclear. These questions&#xD;
      need further investigations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6、study aim： To investigate the risk factors of transient incontinence and establish model to&#xD;
      predict the incontinence. Besides we will evaluate different surgical methods and treatment&#xD;
      methods to improve transient incontinence and the long-term results of different enucleation&#xD;
      methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7、material and methods： I. study design: prospective cohort study II. . We plan to invite 300&#xD;
