  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Guillain-Barre syndrome is an immune-mediated acute inflammatory peripheral neuropathy. The&#xD;
      currently effective treatment methods include intravenous immunoglobulin and plasma exchange.&#xD;
      Immunoadsorption has been widely used to treat immune-related diseases. There are currently&#xD;
      no prospective large-sample clinical trials of immunoadsorption therapy for Guillain-Barre&#xD;
      syndrome. The neuro-intensive care unit of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou&#xD;
      University is preparing to carry out a prospective, multi-center, randomized parallel&#xD;
      controlled clinical study on the efficacy and safety of protein A immunoadsorption and&#xD;
      intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in the treatment of Guillain-Barre syndrome. It is&#xD;
      estimated that 204 patients with Guillain-Barre syndrome will be included. The patients will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to the immunoadsorption group and the IVIG group. The primary outcome&#xD;
      measure: changes in Hughes scores (4 weeks after starting treatment vs. baseline (before&#xD;
      starting treatment) ). This study aims to explore the efficacy and safety of protein A&#xD;
      immunoadsorption and intravenous immunoglobulin in the treatment of Guillain-Barre syndrome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is an immune-mediated acute inflammatory peripheral neuropathy.&#xD;
      The currently proven effective treatment methods include intravenous immunoglobulin and&#xD;
      plasma exchange. In the clinical treatment process, the plasma source is often stressed,&#xD;
      forcing the treatment to be terminated. Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy may cause&#xD;
      allergies. Based on the above reasons, immunosorbent technology came into being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunoadsorption technology is widely used in clinical treatment of immune-related diseases.&#xD;
      Protein A can recognize and bind to the Fc segment of human antibodies. The protein A&#xD;
      immunosorbent column uses recombinant staphylococcal protein A as its ligand. The protein can&#xD;
      specifically recognize and bind to the Fc segment of human antibodies, so it can adsorb human&#xD;
      antibodies, mainly immunoglobulin G, and can adsorb immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin A at&#xD;
      the same time. The binding of protein A and antibody is reversible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunoadsorption therapy has obvious advantages: The patient's own plasma is transfused&#xD;
      without replacement fluid; It can prevent infection Diseases such as viral hepatitis, AIDS,&#xD;
      etc.; The adsorption is selective or specific, and normal plasma components including&#xD;
      coagulation factors, etc., only slightly decrease; Does not affect the simultaneous drug&#xD;
      treatment; The protein A immunosorbent column can be reused; The treatment effect is better,&#xD;
      and the amount of plasma purified by a single immunoadsorption is 1.5 to 3 times that of&#xD;
      plasma exchange.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University is preparing to carry out a&#xD;
      prospective, multi-center, randomized parallel controlled clinical study on the effectiveness&#xD;
      and safety of protein A immunoadsorption and intravenous immunoglobulin in the treatment of&#xD;
      Guillain-Barre syndrome. The control group received intravenous immunoglobulin injections&#xD;
      using the standard treatment recommended by the Guilan-Barre Syndrome Guidelines. Compare the&#xD;
      effectiveness and safety of the two treatment regimens in the treatment of Guillain-Barre&#xD;
      syndrome, and explore a more effective and safe treatment regimen for the treatment of&#xD;
      Guillain-Barre syndrome.&#xD;
