  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite strong consensus that early, specialized intervention for children with Autism&#xD;
      Spectrum Disorder (ASD) can have a dramatic impact on outcomes, the public health system's&#xD;
      capacity to provide such services is severely challenged by the rapid rise in ASD prevalence.&#xD;
      The goal of this research project is to increase timely and equitable access to&#xD;
      ASD-specialized early intervention during the critical first three years of life by&#xD;
      capitalizing on the existing infrastructure of the Part C Early Intervention (EI) system,&#xD;
      which is publicly funded and available in all U.S. States. This project will train EI&#xD;
      providers to use an evidence-based, inexpensive, parent-mediated intervention that can&#xD;
      improve child and family outcomes as well as mitigate the long-term substantial economic&#xD;
      costs associated with ASD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The long-term goal of this study is to improve services and outcomes for children with early&#xD;
      signs of ASD by increasing the capacity to provide appropriately specialized treatment within&#xD;
      an existing infrastructure: the Part C Early Intervention (EI) service delivery system. Part&#xD;
      C is publicly funded, available throughout the United States, and serves children under age 3&#xD;
      who have developmental delays or disabilities. Currently, the effectiveness of EI services is&#xD;
      limited by high practice variation and infrequent use of evidence-based interventions. We are&#xD;
      conducting a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to examine the effectiveness of training EI&#xD;
      providers to deliver Reciprocal Imitation Training (RIT) to children showing early signs of&#xD;
      ASD. RIT is a naturalistic developmental behavioral intervention (NDBI) that is ideally&#xD;
      suited for EI settings because it is low intensity, play-based, easy to learn and implement,&#xD;
      and can be taught to families for their independent use, thus increasing intervention dosage.&#xD;
      This RCT will employ a hybrid type 1 effectiveness/ implementation design, and will use a&#xD;
      unique mixed methods approach to gather evidence that will be essential for implementing RIT&#xD;
      at scale, pending positive trial results. The sample includes 20 EI agencies across 4 U.S.&#xD;
      States and comprises a total of 160 EI providers and 440 families of children with early&#xD;
      symptoms of ASD, which not only provides a robust sample size, but also affords the&#xD;
      opportunity to assess generalizability of this approach across regions that vary in their&#xD;
      implementation of Part C services. EI providers will be randomly assigned to the RIT training&#xD;
      group (n=80) or treatment as usual (TAU; n=80). Providers in both groups will identify 2-5&#xD;
      children in their caseload who are 16-30 months old with early symptoms of ASD (n=220&#xD;
      children per group). Intensive, state-of-the art, multimethod assessment technology will be&#xD;
      used to measure the impact of the intervention on children's language and social&#xD;
      communication, as well as parents' self-efficacy and well-being. Child and family assessments&#xD;
      will be conducted at baseline, 3 months after enrollment, and 9 months after enrollment.&#xD;
      Importantly, this study will examine putative mechanisms through which RIT improves&#xD;
      clinically-relevant outcomes (i.e., child gains in imitation and joint attention; parent&#xD;
      contingent responsiveness). Data regarding provider-initiated modifications to the&#xD;
      intervention and delivery will be analyzed to identify fidelity-consistent vs. fidelity&#xD;
      inconsistent changes, which will inform refinement of future RIT training and quality&#xD;
      assurance procedures. In sum, this study will generate the evidence necessary to implement&#xD;
      RIT at scale, thereby increasing the capacity of the existing EI system to deliver effective,&#xD;
      evidence-based intervention to the rapidly growing population of children who show early&#xD;
      signs of ASD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      a. Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Compared to TAU, children assigned to the RIT group will show more growth from baseline&#xD;
           (T1) to the 9-month follow-up (T3) in motor imitation, initiating joint attention,&#xD;
           language, and social communication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The impact of RIT on children's social communication and language outcomes at T3 will be&#xD;
           mediated by gains in: (a) child joint attention; (b) child motor imitation; and (c)&#xD;
           parent contingent responsivity, as measured from baseline to the 3 month follow-up (T2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Compared to TAU, caregivers assigned to the RIT group will show more improvement in&#xD;
           contingent responsivity, parenting efficacy, and family quality of life from baseline to&#xD;
           the 9-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The impact of RIT on growth of children's social communication and language outcomes&#xD;
           from baseline to the 9-month follow-up will be mediated by: (a) providers' fidelity of&#xD;
           use of RIT strategies following training; and (b) caregivers' frequency and fidelity of&#xD;
           use of RIT strategies after treatment.&#xD;

    <description>Providers in the RIT group (n=80) will receive intensive training (online tutorial, 2-day workshop, and virtual coaching and feedback in the field) in RIT and parent coaching and will be required to achieve fidelity prior to enrolling families from their caseload. They will then be asked to use the intervention with enrolled families for a minimum of 3 months. One intervention session per month for each enrolled family will be videotaped and scored for fidelity. Providers will receive monthly consultation from RIT trainers while these families are in the active treatment phase.</description>

  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Reciprocal Imitation Training</intervention_name>
    <description>RIT is a relatively straightforward, brief NDBI. It employs four simple strategies to target motor imitation and IJA during play: (1) contingent imitation of the child's verbal and nonverbal behavior, (2) linguistic mapping, (3) direct elicitation of object and gesture imitation following the child's interest, and (4) contingent reinforcement. It has been used at low intensities (e.g., 1-3 hours per week) over short periods of time (e.g., 10-12 weeks) to produce robust changes in pivotal skills. It is easy to learn and can be implemented with fidelity by undergraduate-level therapists with limited backgrounds in ASD, as well as by parents and siblings.</description>
