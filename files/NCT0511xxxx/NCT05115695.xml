  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral Palsy (CP) is an activity limitation, movement and posture deficiencies in early&#xD;
      stage of life. In 80% of these children, upper extremity (UE) dysfunctions are observed,&#xD;
      which leads to loss of quality of life, resulting in limited participation in activities of&#xD;
      daily living (ADL). When the hands are affected in UE, fine motor skills such as grasping,&#xD;
      writing and object manipulation are usually limited. This results in inadequate use of the&#xD;
      extremities in functional activities. Although all children with CP are known to be affected&#xD;
      by UE, studies in terms of physiotherapy and rehabilitation methods mostly focused on&#xD;
      children with hemiparetic CP. Similar problems are observed in children with bilateral&#xD;
      involvement. However, a wide variation is observed in the bimanual performance of children&#xD;
      with hemiparetic and bilateral involvement. Studies evaluating UE activities in children with&#xD;
      CP; emphasized that the inability to manipulate objects manually is one of the most important&#xD;
      reasons for the restriction of participation in ADLs. Physiotherapy and rehabilitation&#xD;
      programs include many neurodevelopmental treatment approaches including stretching,&#xD;
      strengthening, positioning, splinting, casting, orthosis selection and movement facilitation.&#xD;
      However, it is known that studies investigating the current efficacy of these treatments on&#xD;
      UE functions mostly focus on unilateral CP. Interventions that focus on improving UE&#xD;
      functions in children with bilateral CP are limited. In UE rehabilitation in bilateral CP;&#xD;
      states that target-focused therapy, bimanual intensive task specific training programs and&#xD;
      trainings such as HABIT (intensive bimanual training of the upper extremity) involving the&#xD;
      lower extremity have been used, but there is only evidence for HABIT-ILE (HABIT involving the&#xD;
      lower extremity). In the literature, it is observed that strengthening training with the&#xD;
      Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation (PNF) method, which makes a significant&#xD;
      contribution to muscle strength balance, is mostly used in lower extremity rehabilitation in&#xD;
      these children. In this study, in the UE rehabilitation of children with hemiparetic and&#xD;
      diparetic CP; in order to stimulate motor responses and improve neuromuscular control and&#xD;
      function, the superiority of the PNF approach applied with scapular and UE patterns over the&#xD;
      traditional Neurodevelopmental Therapy (NGT-Bobath) method will be determined.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      European SP Surveillance (SCPE), CP subtypes according to the dominant type of tone and&#xD;
      movement abnormality; divided into spastic, dyskinetic and ataxic CP. Spastic type SP;&#xD;
      unilateral spastic (hemiparetic) and bilateral (quadriparetic and diparetic), dyskinetic SP;&#xD;
      defined as dystonic and choreoathetotic. Spastic type constitutes 90% of this population and&#xD;
      bilateral/unilateral involvement is observed in this group. In 80% of these children, upper&#xD;
      extremity (UE) dysfunctions are observed, which leads to loss of quality of life, resulting&#xD;
      in limited participation in activities of daily living (ADL).Children with CP as a result of&#xD;
      damage to the motor cortex and corticospinal tracts; develop abnormal movement patterns by&#xD;
      having difficulties in reaching, grasping and fine motor skills of UE. When the hands are&#xD;
      affected in UE, fine motor skills such as grasping, writing and object manipulation are&#xD;
      usually limited. This results in inadequate use of the extremities in functional activities.&#xD;
      Although all children with CP are known to be affected by UE, studies in terms of&#xD;
      physiotherapy and rehabilitation methods mostly focused on children with hemiparetic CP. The&#xD;
      most common in children with hemiparetic CP; increase in muscle tone and decreased normal&#xD;
      joint movement (ROM), decrease in UE muscle and grip strength, primitive grasping reflex,&#xD;
      loss of speed and dexterity are observed. In addition to pure motor impairment, sensorimotor&#xD;
      problems are also observed. Similar problems are observed in children with bilateral&#xD;
      involvement. However, a wide variation is observed in the bimanual performance of children&#xD;
      with hemiparetic and bilateral involvement. Studies evaluating UE activities in children with&#xD;
      CP; emphasized that the inability to manipulate objects manually is one of the most important&#xD;
      reasons for the restriction of participation in ADLs. In a study examining UE disorders, hand&#xD;
      dexterity, grip strength and functionality in ADLs in children with diparetic CP; it was&#xD;
      emphasized that these children also had deficiencies in dexterity, grip strength and&#xD;
      functions in ADL. Therefore, it has been shown that these children are also negatively&#xD;
      affected in terms of hand skills, coordination, UE muscle strength, grip strength, ADL and&#xD;
      functional skills compared to their healthy peers. Observing that UE rehabilitation in CP&#xD;
      remains in the background, studies on the pathophysiology and treatment of UE sequelae in the&#xD;
      last 5 years have come to the fore. Physiotherapy and rehabilitation programs; it includes&#xD;
      many neurodevelopmental treatment approaches including stretching, strengthening,&#xD;
      positioning, splinting, casting, orthosis selection and movement facilitation. However, it is&#xD;
      known that studies investigating the current efficacy of these treatments on UE functions&#xD;
      mostly focus on unilateral CP. Interventions that focus on improving UE functions in children&#xD;
      with bilateral CP are limited. In UE rehabilitation in bilateral CP; states that&#xD;
      target-focused therapy, bimanual intensive task specific training programs and trainings such&#xD;
      as HABIT (intensive bimanual training of the upper extremity) involving the lower extremity&#xD;
      have been used, but there is only evidence for HABIT-ILE (HABIT involving the lower&#xD;
      extremity). In the literature, it is observed that strengthening training with the&#xD;
      Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation (PNF) method, which makes a significant&#xD;
      contribution to muscle strength balance, is mostly used in lower extremity rehabilitation in&#xD;
      CP. In this study, in the UE rehabilitation of children with hemiparetic and diparetic CP; in&#xD;
      order to stimulate motor responses and improve neuromuscular control and function, the&#xD;
      superiority of the PNF approach applied with scapular and UE patterns over the traditional&#xD;
      Neurodevelopmental Therapy (NGT-Bobath) method will be determined. As a result of this study,&#xD;
      it is thought that in addition to traditional NGT-Bobath treatment approaches, muscle&#xD;
      strengthening with scapular pattern and upper extremity patterns of PNF can be an effective&#xD;
      treatment alternative in the UE rehabilitation of children with CP, and it is thought that UE&#xD;
      functional skills, muscle strength and trunk control of individuals will be positively&#xD;
      affected. Included children will be randomized by simple randomisation and divided into 2&#xD;
      groups. An exercise approach with PNF UE patterns will be applied to the first group for 30&#xD;
      minutes, 3 days a week for 6 weeks. UE rehabilitation consisting of Neurodevelopmental&#xD;
      Treatment (NGT-Bobath) approaches will be applied to the second group for 6 weeks, 3 days a&#xD;
      week, 45 minutes a day. Treatments will be carried out by the same doctor physiotherapist&#xD;
      investigator. Evaluations will be made twice, before and after the treatment. All assessments&#xD;
      will be made by a blind doctor physiotherapist investigator who is unfamiliar with the&#xD;
      treatment groups. Alongside the studies in the literature, this study will be the first to&#xD;
      compare the effectiveness of the use of UE patterns of PNF in children with hemiparetic and&#xD;
      diparetic CP.&#xD;
