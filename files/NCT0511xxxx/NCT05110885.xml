  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The addition of SMA and DMD muscle diseases to newborn screening and premarital carrier&#xD;
      screening has been controversial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, researchers aim to measure the awareness level of SMA and DMD muscle diseases&#xD;
      of individuals living in Turkey and to obtain information about their attitudes towards&#xD;
      newborn and carrier screening and physiotherapy practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, this study aimed to determine the factors that affect people's views on this subject.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by a mutation in&#xD;
      survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1), characterized by progressive weakness and muscle atrophy.&#xD;
      With an incidence of 1 in 10,000 and a carrier frequency of 1 in 50, SMA is one of the most&#xD;
      common recessive genetic diseases. SMA muscle disease, which has a broad phenotype, is&#xD;
      classified according to the age of onset of symptoms and motor milestones achieved. Type 1&#xD;
      SMA is the most common type that starts before 6 months. These babies, who never gain the&#xD;
      ability to sit independently, have a severe weakness. It is also one of the most common&#xD;
      genetic causes of death in children. Type 2 SMA occurs before 18 months. With milder&#xD;
      weakness, these infants can sit but never walk independently. Type 3 SMA patients can&#xD;
      ambulate. Type 4 SMA occurs with milder weakness in adults. Providing supportive treatment by&#xD;
      a multidisciplinary team is essential for prolonging life and more comfortable life by&#xD;
      reducing the severity of symptoms, especially in the most severe SMA cases. However, this is&#xD;
      not enough to change the poor prognosis. FDA-approved drugs improve survival and motor&#xD;
      function, allowing some SMA patients to reach motor milestones they've never reached before.&#xD;
      The positive results of medical and physical treatments are most striking before the onset of&#xD;
      the symptoms of weakness in infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked recessive inherited disorder. Mutations in&#xD;
      the dystrophin protein cause this progressive muscle disease, which affects one in 5000 male&#xD;
      newborns in the world. However, developmentally delayed motor milestones, muscle weakness&#xD;
      seen around 2-3 years of age, toe walking, frequent falls, calf hypertrophy, and Gowers Sign&#xD;
      are warning signs for diagnosis. The time from the concern of the families to the certain&#xD;
      diagnosis of the DMD is approximately 2 years. This delay in diagnosis can be devastating for&#xD;
      the family and the patient, as muscle function declines during this time. Although DMD&#xD;
      predominantly affects men, a small number of female carriers may present with a variety of&#xD;
      symptoms. For this reason, genetic testing is recommended to find out the carrier status of&#xD;
      female relatives of patients with DMD. A proactive approach and multidisciplinary teamwork&#xD;
      are required in the care of DMD patients. Early diagnosis and timely access to treatment are&#xD;
      promising for children with DMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the light of all this information, the authors emphasize the importance of early newborn&#xD;
      diagnosis and genetic carrier screening for these two serious muscle diseases. This study was&#xD;
      designed to understand the general awareness of society on these devastating diseases.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the attitude of people towards the newborn and genetic carrier screening, and&#xD;
      the physiotherapy approach as a treatment method will be questioned during the study. A&#xD;
      questionnaire was prepared to obtain information about the issues mentioned above, and it is&#xD;
      not include any kind of scale. This questionnaire also includes the demographical questions&#xD;
      to compare the attitudes and awareness between the different professions, ages and&#xD;
      educational levels.&#xD;
