  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The first step in the management of periodontal disease involves the non-surgical removal of&#xD;
      the soft and hard bacterial deposits at all supra- and sub-gingival sites, especially into&#xD;
      deep pockets, which can be carried on with different instruments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately it seems that, after the initial therapy, many patients still present with&#xD;
      active pockets (residual pockets) requiring further treatment and posing a risk of disease&#xD;
      progression. This might be due to limitations of the instruments applied and patient-related&#xD;
      factors. Air-polishing with low-abrasiveness powders seems to be very effective in the&#xD;
      removal of supra- and sub-gingival biofilm and could provide additional benefits during the&#xD;
      treatment of pockets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this randomized, controlled, split-mouth study was to compare the efficacy of&#xD;
      full-mouth air-polishing followed by ultrasonic debridement (GBT) versus traditional Scaling&#xD;
      and Root Planing (SRP), in terms of pocket closure in patients with stage III-IV&#xD;
      periodontitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test this hypothesis, the mouth of each patients, upon initial evaluation, were divided in&#xD;
      2 parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The control group undergoing a standard procedure: ultrasonic debridement with an&#xD;
           ultrasonic scaler for remove supra and sub gingival calculus, manual debridement with&#xD;
           curettes at deep pathological pockets (PPD &gt; 4mm) and rubber cup with polishing to&#xD;
           remove supra gingival biofilm and plaque.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The study group undergoing the innovative air polishing procedure: airflow with&#xD;
           erythritol powder to remove supra and sub gingival biofilm and plaque, perioflow at deep&#xD;
           pathological pockets (PPD &gt; 4mm) and ultrasonic debridement with an ultrasonic scaler&#xD;
           for remove supra and sub gingival calculus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of residual pockets will be evaluated at 6 weeks and 3 months after the&#xD;
      initial therapy and compared between the two groups.&#xD;

      TRIAL DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective, single-masked, randomized, split-mouth, longitudinal clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The primary outcome was the number of experimental sites (PPD &gt;4mm and &lt;10mm) becoming&#xD;
           closed pockets (PPD ≤ 4mm) at 6 weeks (T1) and 3 months (T2) after initial therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary outcomes were the variations in PPD, REC (Clinical Gingival Recession), CAL&#xD;
           (Clinical Attachment Level), BOP (Bleeding On Probing) and PI (Plaque Index) at the&#xD;
           experimental sites and treatment time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 10% difference in the primary outcome between the two protocols was set as the threshold to&#xD;
      define inferiority/non-inferiority of the Test treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      thirty-two (32) adults, aged 18-75 years, will be entered into study (randomized).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized subjects who deviate from the protocol (major protocol deviation) and, for this&#xD;
      reason, are excluded from the analysis, will be replaced to guarantee that the sample&#xD;
      required for the analysis (32) is reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Signed Informed Consent Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Male and female subjects, aged 18-75 years, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Good general health (free of systemic diseases such as diabetes, HIV infection or&#xD;
           genetic disorder, ongoing malignant disease of any type that could influence the outcome&#xD;
           of the treatment and might interfere with the evaluation of the study objectives).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnosis of Stage III-IV periodontitis;17&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At least 6 sites per quadrant with Pocket Probing Depth (PPD) ≥ 3mm;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At least 5 teeth per quadrant;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Availability for the 3-month duration of the study for an assigned subject.&#xD;
