      To assess the safety and tolerability profile, in the pre- and perioperative period (up to 30&#xD;
      days post-surgery), of combined modality treatment (CMT) by administering DDRi and RT&#xD;
      concurrently treating newly diagnosed, non-metastatic soft tissue sarcoma patients with&#xD;
      DDRi-based CMT, in the specific context of systemic toxicities, wound healing post-surgery&#xD;
      and in defining the RP2D for the combinations to support further clinical evaluation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite improvements in surgery and radiation for soft tissue sarcoma (STS) patients, local&#xD;
      relapses remain an important event for these patients. Most STS subtypes are considered&#xD;
      radioresistant. Investigations into radiosensitization mediated by combining systemic&#xD;
      compounds with neoadjuvant radiotherapy (RT) may translate into an increased rate of&#xD;
      pathological responses, an increased rate of R0 resections and thus fewer local relapses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RT is highly potent in inducing DNA damage. Normal cells are usually sufficiently able to&#xD;
      repair this damage timely before the next fraction because of an intact DNA Damage Response&#xD;
      (DDR) pathway. Frequently, tumor cells have (partial or complete) defects in the DDR pathways&#xD;
      rendering them more sensitive to radiation than normal tissues. Inhibition of constituents of&#xD;
      the DDR pathways may further widen the therapeutic window of fractionated RT. Clinical&#xD;
      studies into radiosensitization of STS by combinations of RT and DDR inhibitors are&#xD;
      warranted. In this study the candidate inhibitors are the new drugs AZD1390 and AZD7648,&#xD;
      targeting ATM (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated) and DNA-dependent protein kinase PK,&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed newly diagnosed intermediate to high grade soft tissue&#xD;
             sarcoma localized to the extremities, for which the standard treatment is a&#xD;
             combination of RT and surgery (deep seated and/or &gt; 5cm in largest tumor diameter&#xD;
             and/or an anticipated close resection margin and/or grade II/III according to the&#xD;
             FNCLCC definition);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients staged by at least a CT scan of the chest (and a CT scan of the abdomen, if&#xD;
             deemed indicated according to local practices, e.g. in case of a myxoid liposarcoma).&#xD;
             Staging may also be performed by FDG-PET scanning and or total body MRI scans. This&#xD;
             staging procedure should not reveal metastatic disease. If, however, a low metastatic&#xD;
             burden is detected such that this does not preclude the application of both&#xD;
             preoperative RT and definitive surgery, patients are allowed to participate;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  WHO Performance Status ≤ 2;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able and willing to undergo preoperative RT;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able and willing to undergo definitive surgery;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able and willing to comply with regular follow-up visits;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able and willing to swallow and retain oral medication;&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with any type soft tissue sarcoma located above the clavicles.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior malignancies; except another malignancy and disease-free for ≥ 5 years, or&#xD;
             completely resected non-melanomatous skin carcinoma or successfully treated in situ&#xD;
             carcinoma;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with recurrent sarcomas who underwent prior RT to the target lesion (if the&#xD;
             primary sarcoma was managed by surgery only and no perioperative RT, patients are&#xD;
             eligible);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ewing sarcoma and other PNET family tumors, rhabdomyosarcomas (both pediatric and&#xD;
             adult), bone sarcomas;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition potentially&#xD;
             hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule; those conditions&#xD;
             should be discussed with the patient before registration in the trial;&#xD;
