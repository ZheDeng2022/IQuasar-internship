  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Controlled laboratory experiment to examine whether Episodic Future Thinking influences loss&#xD;
      aversion and cigarette smoking among current daily cigarette smokers.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to examine in a controlled laboratory study using a randomized parallel-group&#xD;
      design whether Episodic Future Thinking can increase Loss Aversion among adult daily smokers&#xD;
      and also decrease cigarette smoking. The study design will also test the durability of&#xD;
      Episodic Future Thinking with short- and longer-term assessments. Potential influence of DD&#xD;
      and sociodemographic confounders will be accounted for in all analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1.1: Episodic Future Thinking will increase LA and reduce cigarette smoking (i.e.,&#xD;
      number of puffs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1.2: Episodic Future Thinking will remain effective in tests of LA and smoking at&#xD;
      30- and 90-days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1.3: Changes in Loss Aversion will moderate the effect of Episodic Future Thinking&#xD;
      on cigarette smoking independent of changes in Delay Discounting.&#xD;

    <measure>Loss aversion</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Loss aversion will be measured with a gamble task developed by Tom et al. (2007). Participants will choose whether to accept or reject each of a series of hypothetical lotteries offering a 50-50 chance of a monetary loss and a monetary gain. Participants will indicate their decision to play a lottery by clicking on accept or reject buttons (strongly accept, accept, reject, strongly reject) located on the screen below the amounts (Figure 2). The task will consist of a series of 49 trials presenting each combination of 7 possible gains (+$2, +$12, +$22, +$32, +$42, +$52, and +$62) and 7 possible losses (-$1, -$6, -$11, -$16, -$21, -$26, and -$31). Combinations of gains and losses will be presented in random order.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cigarette self-administration</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>All participants will complete a 60-min self-administration task, in which they can earn single cigarette puffs for every 10 clicks on a moving circle on a computer screen. After completing each response requirement, participants will self-administer 1 cigarette puff. Target cigarette puff volume will be standardized at approximately 70 mL and participants will be instructed to light a cigarette without inhaling, place it in a cigarette holder connected to the pressure sensor, and inhale from the cigarette while estimated puff volume is displayed on the computer screen in real time. The displayed puff volume will turn from white to red at 60 ml and signal the approximate time participants should stop inhaling to reach 70 ml. Participants will have practiced this procedure prior to the task. Participants will be instructed that they can smoke as much or as little as they want during the task.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Delay discounting</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Delay discounting will be measured with a standard adjusting-amount task. This task used to measure intervention effects on delay discounting (e.g., Stein et al., 2016). At each of five delays, participants will choose between two different hypothetical amounts: $1,000.00 available after a delay or a smaller amount of money available immediately. The smaller amount will be titrated across six consecutive trials until reaching a point of subjective equality between choice options. Delays will be presented in random order. The value of the smaller amount at indifference indexes the discounted value of the larger option at each delay. This titration process will repeat at each of five delays: 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 1 year.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Substance-free reinforcement</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>We will measure substance-free reinforcement with the reward probability index (RPI; Carvalho et al., 2011). The RPI includes 20 items that broadly index access to environmental reward as rewarding experiences, skills, and ability (Reward Probability subscale), as well as negative events and environmental barriers to reward (Environmental Suppressors subscale). Participants indicate agreement with each statement on a 4-point scale (1 = strongly disagree, 4 = strongly agree). Following recommendations by Carvalho et al. (2011), items on each subscale will be summed to create subscale scores.</description>

    <description>Group Experimental will generate three positive, autobiographical events that could realistically occur following each of five delays in the subsequent DD task: 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 1 year. Participants will be told to not include events related specifically to smoking. Using a five-point Likert scale, participants will rate each event according to four dimensions: vividness, enjoyment, importance, and excitement. The event rated the most vivid at each time frame will be chosen for use in subsequent behavioral testing (ties will be settled randomly). Participants will then be recorded reciting a self-created two or three-sentence summary of each event. These recordings will serve as audio cues. Participants will also create abbreviated versions of each description to serve as text cues.</description>
