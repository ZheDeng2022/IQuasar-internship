  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first in man study to determine if [203Pb]VMT-α-NET identifies neuroendocrine&#xD;
      tumors with SPECT/CT. This is the first step to testing [212Pb]-based alpha radiation therapy&#xD;
      in neuroendocrine therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this work is to use [203Pb]VMT-α-NET as the imaging agent to create a specialized&#xD;
      patient treatment plan using [212Pb]VMT-α-NET as a first-in-human therapy for treatment&#xD;
      resistant or refractory neuroendocrine tumors of the foregut or midgut. The first step is to&#xD;
      test the imaging agent [203Pb]VMT-α-NET. This requires a very small dose of the drug&#xD;
      (microdose) which is then measured by a series of images (like CT scans) over 4 days. Blood&#xD;
      samples are also drawn that that time. It is hoped the imaging will identify the tumors so&#xD;
      that a therapy using [212Pb]VMT-α-NET can be created.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and willingness to provide informed consent&#xD;

             of study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aged ≥ 18 years at the time of study drug administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pathologically confirmed (histology or cytology) well-differentiated neuroendocrine&#xD;
             tumor (WHO Grade 1 or 2) with primary location known or believed to be midgut or&#xD;
             foregut&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 1 somatostatin receptor positive tumor site as demonstrated by PET/CT study&#xD;
             utilizing [68Ga]DOTATOC or [68Ga]DOTATATE within 12 months of consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ≥1 evaluable site of disease measuring ≥ 2.0 cm in any dimension on CT or MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate performance status (ECOG of 0 or 1; or KPS of ≥70).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Not experiencing an uncontrolled intercurrent illness such as: infection requiring&#xD;
             inpatient admission, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,&#xD;
             cardiac arrhythmia, psychiatric illness/social situations, or any other condition that&#xD;
             would limit compliance with study requirements as determined by study team members.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are pregnant or breast feeding. A pregnancy test will be administered to&#xD;
             women of child-bearing potential (per institutional policies) at screening. Women must&#xD;
             agree to pregnancy tests prior to each administration of a radionuclidic agent for&#xD;
             this study.&#xD;

             [203Pb]VMT-α-NET on the infant are unknown and relatively long half-life, women may&#xD;
             not resume breast feeding for the current child.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Therapeutic investigational drug within 4 weeks of C1D1&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subject's weight exceeds the limit of the imaging system.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Long-acting somatostatin analogue treatment ≤ 20 days of C1D1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to [90Y]DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide, Octreoscan®, or [68Ga]Octreotide.&#xD;
