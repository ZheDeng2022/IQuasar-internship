  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Problematic Internet Use (PIU) and Unsafe Internet Use (UIU) are the two main potential&#xD;
      negative consequences of children's online activities. Parents have a vital role in reducing&#xD;
      these consequences and shaping a safe digital environment. Parental Vigilant Care (PVC) is a&#xD;
      systematic approach that integrates active and restrictive mediation practices, in which&#xD;
      parents regulate their involvement according to the alarm signs the parents detect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a randomized controlled trial designed to assess the efficacy of the PVC parent&#xD;
      training. Families were randomly assigned to either (1) PVC group (2) Technological Parental&#xD;
      Monitoring group (3) combining both group parental training and installation of filtering&#xD;
      devices (PVC + TPM) or (4) Control group.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND: One of the most disturbing phenomena regarding the digital age is Problematic&#xD;
      Internet Use (PIU) among adolescents (12-16). PIU is defined as a functioning impairment due&#xD;
      to: (1) internet excessive use that may lead to the neglect of developmental tasks, or (2)&#xD;
      unsafe use which includes viewing inappropriate content, abusive encounters, or commercial&#xD;
      exploitation. Clinical and research experience shows that parental involvement plays a&#xD;
      critical role in reducing risk behaviors among adolescents in various domains. Despite the&#xD;
      ample literature regarding parental involvement, few studies have evaluated the efficacy of&#xD;
      parental involvement on adolescents' PIU in reducing functional impairment and designing a&#xD;
      safe digital environment. One of the most investigated theoretical approaches in this field&#xD;
      is Parental Monitoring (PM). PM is defined as a set of parental practices that aim to monitor&#xD;
      and supervise adolescent activities. Despite evidence that PM is effective in reducing risk&#xD;
      behaviors among adolescents, PM also has some drawbacks. Studies have demonstrated that it&#xD;
      may be perceived as rigid parental control, thereby damaging internalization of parental&#xD;
      presence, and potentially sabotaging adolescents' growing independence and autonomy. In the&#xD;
      digital world, rigid PM can be defined as using filtering and surveillance applications that&#xD;
      enable parents to closely monitor and enforce strict rules regarding their child's internet&#xD;
      use. This approach is defined as in the current study as &quot;Technological Parental Monitoring&quot;&#xD;
      (TPM). On the other hand, &quot;Parental Vigilant Care&quot; (PVC), is theoretically conceptualized as&#xD;
      an alternative parental involvement approach that addresses the weaknesses of PM. By&#xD;
      implementing PVC principles, parents develop a positive and non-judgmental dialogue with&#xD;
      their children regarding domains the participants are concerned about. Additionally, parents&#xD;
      determine their level of active involvement in a flexible manner, specific to the risks&#xD;
      presented by their children. By executing decisive and consistent parental involvement,&#xD;
      parents strengthen their presence in their children's digital world, therefore, reducing PIU&#xD;
      by internalization of safe digital behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES: The current study aims to examine the efficacy of using digital parental control,&#xD;
      according to TPM approach, in comparison with flexible integration of positive parental&#xD;
      presence with setting boundaries, according to PVC approach. These approaches will be&#xD;
      compared in light of the following outcomes: (1) increasing effective parental involvement in&#xD;
      PIU of their adolescent children, (2) reducing PIU and improving adolescent's functioning,&#xD;
      and (3) internalizing parental values regarding safe digital activities by children, in order&#xD;
      to maintain a parental presence over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD: To examine these objectives, a randomized controlled trial was conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation: To assess sample size, the investigators used G-Power software,&#xD;
      assuming type 1 error of 5%, power 80%, and analysis of variance, repeated measures with&#xD;
      three measurement points, a moderate effect size of time X group interaction (Âµ2 = .15). The&#xD;
      minimum sample size required to meet these assumptions was 134 participants. The final sample&#xD;
      consisted of 157 adolescents, in addition to their parents (one parent for each adolescent),&#xD;
      yielding a total sample size of 314 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two-hundred and 297 parents and their children (12-16 y/o) were randomly assigned to four&#xD;
      groups: (1) Group parental training according to PVC approach; (2) installation of filtering&#xD;
      devices on adolescents' mobile phones and setting them for reducing time use and prohibiting&#xD;
      inappropriate content (TPM); (3) combining both group parental training and installation of&#xD;
      filtering devices (PVC + TPM) and (4) control group that did not receive any intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three types of measures were used: (A) Self-reported questionnaires completed by parents:&#xD;
      Parental Helplessness for Internet Supervision, Internet Parental Styles, Norms for Unsafe&#xD;
      Internet Behaviour, Parental Knowledge of the child's online activities, Family Environment&#xD;
      and Adolescent's Functioning (B) Self-reported questionnaires completed by adolescent:&#xD;
      Problematic Internet Use and unsafe internet behavior (C) Cellular internet usage retrieved&#xD;
      directly from adolescents' mobile devices including total time online, as well as time by&#xD;
      specific contents (video games, pornography, gambling, YouTube and social networking sites).&#xD;
      The self-report questionnaires were gathered at three time points - before intervention (T1),&#xD;
      immediately after termination of intervention (T2) and after 8 weeks follow-up (T3). The&#xD;
      online activities data were gathered continuously for 12 weeks (a baseline week, 3 weeks of&#xD;
      intervention and 8 weeks of follow-up).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data were analyzed using SPSS version 25. First, descriptive statistics were produced using&#xD;
      means and standard deviations for all variables. Group comparisons on demographic variables&#xD;
      were conducted using chi-square tests for categorical variables and t- tests for continuous&#xD;
      variables. Intervention effects were examined using intent-to-treat analyses. The groups were&#xD;
      compared with self-reported measures using repeated measures Analysis of Covariance,&#xD;
      examining interaction effect between time (within-subject) and group (between-subject). In&#xD;
      these analyses, the expectation to benefit from treatment was controlled. Post-hoc&#xD;
      corrections were used for to further examine the significant two-way interactions, and&#xD;
      depicted the effect sizes using Cohen's d's both between baseline (T0) and post-intervention&#xD;
      (T1), and also between post-intervention (T1) and follow-up (T2). Time of online activity was&#xD;
      analyzed using Multi-Level Modeling (MLM) since average daily time online per-week (12 weeks)&#xD;
      was nested in the child's group (PVC vs. Control). In addition, to examine the persistence of&#xD;
      improvement achieved during intervention, change in average time online between intervention&#xD;
      period (3 weeks) and the follow-up period (8 weeks) was tested.&#xD;
