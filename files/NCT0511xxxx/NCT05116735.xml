      Purpose : The primary goals of this study were to determine the prevalence and risk factors&#xD;
      of occult CBC and recurrence, as well as the relationship between occult cysto-biliary&#xD;
      communications manifested as postoperative biliary leakage and recurrence. The secondary goal&#xD;
      was to use chemical analysis of hydatid cyst fluid to assess excessive bilirubin and alkaline&#xD;
      phosphatase levels as predictors of fistula and recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This prospective multi-center experimental and follow-up study of six years duration&#xD;
      was conducted at the hepato-biliary pancreatic units of our universities hospitals from&#xD;
      September 2010 to September 2016. Initially, 292 patients were included, but only 244&#xD;
      patients enrolled in the final study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hydatid cyst disease (HCD) is a zoonotic illness caused by Echinococcus Granulosus that&#xD;
      infects humans via ingestion of eggs and primarily affects the liver (50-70%), followed by&#xD;
      the lungs, brain, and other viscera [1-2]. To facilitate consistent diagnosis, treatment, and&#xD;
      follow-up, the World Health Organization Informal Working Group on Echinococcosis (WHO-IWGE)&#xD;
      arranged a standardized ultrasonography staging based on the cyst's&#xD;
      active-transitional-inactive stage [3].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various therapy options for hydatid cyst management range from medical treatment alone, which&#xD;
      has been shown to be ineffective in curing the condition [4-5], to surgical treatment, which&#xD;
      is considered the primary therapeutic option [6]. For hydatid cysts, laparoscopic surgery is&#xD;
      both safe and successful [7-10]. Laparoscopic procedures range from conservative procedures&#xD;
      such as laparoscopic partial cystectomy and omentoplasty to obliterate the residual&#xD;
      cavity[11] to radical procedures such as pericystectomy or hepatic resection [12]. The type&#xD;
      of surgery to be performed is determined by the location, size, and presence of cyst&#xD;
      complications [13].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cysto-biliary communication (CBC) is a common complication after hepatic HCD surgery that&#xD;
      occurs when a cyst bursts into the biliary system [14], with a reported incidence of 13%-37%&#xD;
      [15] and can manifest as frank or occult (silent) CBC [16]. Cyst fluid, scolices, small&#xD;
      daughter cysts, and minor fragments of the endocyst membranes migrate into the biliary tract&#xD;
      in occult or silent CBC, but neither clinically nor radiologically can be detected [17].&#xD;
      Postoperative biliary leakage will occur if Occult CBC is overlooked during surgery, and will&#xD;
      manifest as biliary drainage, biliary peritonitis, and biliary abscess. [18-19]. Another&#xD;
      issue is recurrence after hydatid cyst surgery, which has a range of (0-22 percent) [20].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study, gap statement, and study strength:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although several studies have looked at the results of laparoscopic partial cystectomy with&#xD;
      omentoplasty in terms of postoperative biliary fistula and recurrence, no investigations into&#xD;
      the link between occult cysto-biliary communication and late recurrence have been published.&#xD;
      Furthermore, no studies have looked into the value of cystic fluid analysis in detecting&#xD;
      occult cysto-biliary communication, which can lead to biliary leakage and recurrence after&#xD;
      surgery. The primary goals of this study were to determine the prevalence and risk factors of&#xD;
      occult CBC and recurrence, as well as the relationship between occult cysto-biliary&#xD;
      communications manifested as postoperative biliary leakage and recurrence. The secondary goal&#xD;
      was to use chemical analysis of hydatid cyst fluid to assess excessive bilirubin and alkaline&#xD;
      phosphatase levels as predictors of fistula and recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This prospective multi-center experimental and follow-up study of six years&#xD;
      duration was conducted at the hepato-biliary pancreatic units of our universities hospitals&#xD;
      from September 2010 to September 2016. Initially, 292 patients were included, but only 244&#xD;
      patients enrolled in the final study as a comprehensive sample after the final assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Stages CE2, CE3b According to the WHO-IWGE classification ,solitary,&#xD;
      symptomatic or asymptomatic, superficial cyst, cases not suited for hepatic resection as the&#xD;
      cyst wall abutting critical vascular and biliary structures as hepatic resection is harmful&#xD;
      or excessive loss of hepatic tissue were used as inclusion criteria.The criteria for&#xD;
      exclusion included the following: , stages CL, CE1, CE3a, CE4, CE5 according to WHO-IWGE&#xD;
      classification of the hydatid cyst ,preoperative total bilirubin level greater than 2.0 mg/dl&#xD;
      and direct bilirubin level greater than 1.5 mg/dl, common bile duct dilatation greater than&#xD;
      10 mm in the United States, or CT, or MRI, previous percutaneous treatment, recurrent cases&#xD;
      after any type of surgery, cases with associated extrahepatic or extra-abdominal hydatid&#xD;
      cyst, cysts affecting an entire lobe or the main pedicles, stages Cysts that are complicated&#xD;
      (ruptured or diseased cysts), deep cysts, Patients who refuse intervention, have a surgical&#xD;
      contraindication, are pregnant, have hydatid cysts in both lobes of the liver, previous liver&#xD;
      surgery, liver abscess, frank CBC, cases lost during follow-up, cases who refused to take&#xD;
      albendazole, or cases who developed albendazole-related issues (disturbed liver function).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Types of outcomes (study endpoints):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcomes were to determine the prevalence and risk factors of undetected&#xD;
      cysto-biliary communication, recurrence, and the relationship between biliary fistula and&#xD;
      recurrence. The secondary outcome was to see how well chemical analysis of hydatid cyst fluid&#xD;
      might detect occult cysto-biliary problems and how they related to postoperative biliary&#xD;
      leakage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of terms and measurement of outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An external biliary fistula Bile leakage was defined as a bilirubin concentration in the&#xD;
      drain fluid of at least three times the serum bilirubin concentration on or after&#xD;
      postoperative day three, or as the need for radiologic or operative intervention resulting&#xD;
      from biliary collections or bile peritonitis, according to the International Study Group of&#xD;
      Liver Surgery [21]. The clinical care of patients with Grade A biliary leakage remains&#xD;
      unchanged. Bile leakage in Grade B requires active therapeutic intervention but is treatable&#xD;
      without relaparotomy, but bile leaking in Grade C necessitates relaparotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recurrence: is the appearance of new active cysts after intrahepatic or extrahepatic disease&#xD;
      [22-23]. Cysts areas imaged without a change in size and evidence of daughter cysts were not&#xD;
      considered recurrence [20].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative morbidity: was evaluated by Clavien and Dindo [24]. Hydatid cyst fluid&#xD;
      analysis:Biochemical indexes of hydatid-cyst fluid detected by the automatic biochemical&#xD;
      analyzer (AU-400, Olympus) [25].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recurrence-free survival is defined as the time from surgery until relapse of the disease at&#xD;
      any site or death from any cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perioperative technique and follow up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were assessed by multidisciplinary surgical, radiological, and anaesthetic teams&#xD;
      prior to surgery. Liver function, serum alkaline phosphatase, and serum bilirubin were all&#xD;
      tested before surgery, as well as the coagulation profile, ultrasound abdomen and pelvis, CT&#xD;
      scan abdomen (Fig 1) and pelvis, and CT thorax. The protocol treatment for albendazole was&#xD;
      10mg/kg ten days prior to surgery and continued for six months after surgery with a two-week&#xD;
      break between each month, with complete blood count and liver function tests. As in a prior&#xD;
      study [26], a laparoscopic partial cystectomy with omentoplasty was performed.After the&#xD;
      cystic cavity had been fully evacuated and complete hemostasis had been achieved,&#xD;
      saline-soaked gauzes were placed in the cystic cavity for 10 minutes to observe the presence&#xD;
      of bile while compressing either the gallbladder or common bile duct to stimulate bile&#xD;
      backflow through cysto-biliary communication if present, and the visible orifices of the&#xD;
      cystobiliary communications were oversewn. The process was completed if the gauzes were not&#xD;
      stained with bile. A cholangiogram was not performed during the procedure.Omentoplasty was&#xD;
      performed by inserting a right gastroepiploic-based flap from the larger omentum into the&#xD;
      cavity and stitching it to the cyst wall with two to three interrupted vicryl 2/0 threads. In&#xD;
      all cases, the subhepatic space was drained using a single drain. When there was no sign of&#xD;
      bile leakage, a drain was routinely removed after 2-5 days. Patients were discharged home on&#xD;
      the third and fifth postoperative days. Follow-up appointments were scheduled every one&#xD;
      month, three months, six months, one year, and then every six months for the next four years,&#xD;
      or if patients developed symptoms before the conclusion of the follow-up period (5 years).&#xD;
      The bile drain was left open for a longer period of time in the case of bile drainage.&#xD;
      Ultrasound was used to check the cyst cavity after surgery at 1, 3, 6 months, one year, and&#xD;
      then every six months for the rest of the time. If the ultrasound results were inconclusive,&#xD;
      a CT scan was ordered.&#xD;
