      Sometimes in hospital, it is not noticed that patients are becoming unwell quickly enough.&#xD;
      This may mean that they are less likely to survive than if the worsening of their illness had&#xD;
      been picked up sooner. One reason for this may be that hospital staff are unable to check&#xD;
      patients' vital signs (such as breathing rate, heart rate and level of oxygen in their blood)&#xD;
      frequently enough to help them decide if a patient is becoming more unwell. Currently, for&#xD;
      nurses to watch these vital signs closely, patients are either attached to a static machine&#xD;
      by the patient's bedside using wires, or staff visit the patient every few hours to measure&#xD;
      these vital signs using a portable wired machine. It is now possible to closely monitor&#xD;
      patients using small devices which attach to the wrist, finger or chest. These devices allow&#xD;
      nursing staff to continually watch vital signs data from these patients when they are away&#xD;
      from their bedside. These machines are also wireless and portable, so they do not stop&#xD;
      patients moving around, which is important for recovery, and are comfortable to wear. In past&#xD;
      years, the investigators have tested these devices and developed a system to allow the&#xD;
      clinical staff to see the continuous vital signs. In this final stage of the project, the&#xD;
      investigators will test this system (with the selected devices) on patients in hospital. The&#xD;
      investigators will start by doing a small trial on one surgical ward, and asking for staff&#xD;
      and patient feedback of how the system worked, how useful it was, and how easy to use. If the&#xD;
      feedback from this first small trial is positive, the investigators will conduct a future&#xD;
      trial in several hospitals, to test how useful the system is in improving patient recovery.&#xD;

      The primary objective of this study is to assess the impact of ambulatory monitoring systems&#xD;
      (AMS) integration (with active clinical alerts) versus standard care in deterioration&#xD;
      detection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives include other deterioration detection and clinical outcomes, trial&#xD;
      progression outcomes, staff impact and alerting system performance, overall system&#xD;
      reliability and patient experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a superiority feasibility randomised controlled trial with two-arm parallel&#xD;
      groups and 1:1 allocation ratio to compare the use of an ambulatory monitoring system with&#xD;
      standard care in hospitalised patients. This feasibility trial will be conducted not only to&#xD;
      assess the impact of AMS on early deterioration detection and other clinical outcomes but&#xD;
      also to explore recruitment rate, calculate required sample size, number of sites and&#xD;
      recruitment period for a full definitive RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited in one or more surgical wards inside Oxford University&#xD;
      Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (to be decided during feasibility trial, dependant on&#xD;
      recruitment rate). Patients will be screened, recruited and participate in this study&#xD;
      throughout their hospital stay, no follow-up visits will be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention consists in the use of AMS that also includes an alerting system.&#xD;
      Participants will wear one pulse oximeter (WristOx2 3150 OEM BLE, shorted to &quot;Nonin&quot;,&#xD;
      hereafter) measuring pulse rate (PR) and oxygen saturation (SpO2), one chest patch&#xD;
      (VitalPatch) that will continuously measure their heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR),&#xD;
      temperature,; and one A&amp;D UA-1200 BLE Blood Pressure device, intermittently measuring&#xD;
      systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and pulse rate. Clinical staff will be able to access&#xD;
      and interact with real-time vital signs through a dashboard style display and will be alerted&#xD;
      via a hand-held device, and/or dashboard, according to the patient's EWS score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will also be fitted with these devices. However, clinical staff will not be&#xD;
      able to access the dashboard display or receive alerts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will include a calibration period inside a surgical unit were the investigators&#xD;
      will refine out alerting system. During this period the investigaotors will optimise our&#xD;
      alerts through continuous analysis and feedback from the relevant clinical teams.&#xD;
      Randomisation will still be conducted during this period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This feasibility trial will be conducted in surgical units at the John Radcliffe Hospital,&#xD;
      Oxford University Hospitals (OUH) NHS Foundation Trust. This will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the feasibility of a definitive RCT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Support sample size calculation for full study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess recruitment rate and the need for inclusion of more wards inside OUH.Staff focus&#xD;
           groups or interviews will be held to gather feedback on the system which may inform&#xD;
           further refinements, including usability, perceived effect on workload and&#xD;
           appropriateness of alerts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multi-professionals staff interviews with be held to assess staff perception of the&#xD;
           acceptability of the system in clinical practice. Patients interviews will be held with&#xD;
           patient who have worn the monitoring, to gain their perceptions of the system, including&#xD;
           wearability, sense of safety and potential improvements.&#xD;
