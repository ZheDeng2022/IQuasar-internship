  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To study whether oxygen therapy titrated to maintain oxygenation (SpO2) &gt; 90% at 2500m would&#xD;
      resolve altitude-related adverse health effects, symptoms and impaired exercise during 30h&#xD;
      exposure to high altitude.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with pulmonary hypertension who reveal an altitude-related adverse health effects at&#xD;
      2500m will be given oxygen therapy by nasal cannula titrated to maintain the oxygen&#xD;
      saturation above 90%. The study will investigate, whether this measure will restore&#xD;
      altitude-induced impairment to baseline levels at low altitude.&#xD;
