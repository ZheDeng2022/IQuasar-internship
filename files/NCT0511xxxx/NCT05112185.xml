  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interventions that promote water consumption in place of sugar-sweetened beverages have shown&#xD;
      promise for preventing childhood obesity in schoolchildren. Yet to date, no studies have&#xD;
      examined whether applying this approach in childcare centers could help to prevent childhood&#xD;
      obesity at an even earlier stage of development. This cluster-randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      will fill gaps by examining how a multilevel childcare-based healthy beverage intervention&#xD;
      affects young children's consumption of beverages and obesity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is little debate that sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs; drinks with added sugar) lack&#xD;
      nutrition, are a major source of added sugar and calories, and promote obesity and poor&#xD;
      cardiometabolic health, especially when consumed during early childhood. Nearly half of&#xD;
      children aged 2-5 drink SSBs on a daily basis, with heavier consumption in low-income Latino&#xD;
      children. After decades of research, it is clear that there is no single &quot;magic bullet&quot; for&#xD;
      solving obesity. What we need are bundled interventions that combine incremental changes that&#xD;
      transform food environments with targeted behavior changes that steer people towards those&#xD;
      healthy options. Childcare centers, which serve 12.5 million children per year, provide an&#xD;
      efficient way to intervene early by engaging childcare providers and parents to make&#xD;
      resonant, mutually reinforcing changes in both the home and childcare environment.&#xD;
      Interventions that promote water consumption in place of SSBs have shown promise for&#xD;
      preventing childhood obesity in schoolchildren. Yet, no studies have examined whether&#xD;
      interventions to promote intake of water instead of SSBs in childcare could prevent childhood&#xD;
      obesity at an even earlier stage of development. The proposed cluster-randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial will test the efficacy of an intervention called Healthy Drinks, Healthy Futures&#xD;
      (Bebidas Saludables, Futuros Saludables) that is culturally adapted for Latino children and&#xD;
      families. Following the Social-Ecological Model and Social Learning Theory, the intervention&#xD;
      supports complementary changes in the childcare and home food environments that promote water&#xD;
      consumption while reducing SSB availability. This is combined with education for childcare&#xD;
      providers and children, and a one-on-one brief motivational counseling intervention with&#xD;
      parents to reduce SSB intake and encourage water consumption in the home. Fourteen childcare&#xD;
      centers serving low-income, predominately Latino children (n=420) will participate in this&#xD;
      trial. The primary outcome is child BMI z-score (BMI standard deviation score). Key secondary&#xD;
      outcomes are intake of water and beverage calories at centers and at home. Outcomes will be&#xD;
      captured using anthropometrics (weight, height), and beverage frequency questionnaires at&#xD;
      baseline, 6-months, and 12-months post-intervention. Plate waste measurements (water and&#xD;
      caloric intake at centers) and Automated Self-Administered 24-hour dietary recalls (water and&#xD;
      caloric intake at home) will occur at baseline and 12 months post-intervention. Surveys of&#xD;
      childcare providers and parents will allow us to explore possible mediators of the&#xD;
      intervention effect. We hypothesize that the childcare-based healthy beverage intervention&#xD;
      will increase intake of water and reduce beverage calories consumed at both childcare and at&#xD;
      home. BMI z-score will also improve among children in intervention centers vs. control&#xD;
      centers. If shown to be effective, the Healthy Drinks, Healthy Futures intervention will&#xD;
      offer a strategy for intervening early to prevent obesity for millions of low-income children&#xD;
      attending childcare centers. Findings from this study will contribute to the science of&#xD;
      multilevel obesity prevention, and inform the implementation of state, federal, and local&#xD;
      policies to promote healthy beverage intake in childcare centers.&#xD;
