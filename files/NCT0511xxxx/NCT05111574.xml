  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial tests whether nivolumab in combination with cabozantinib works in&#xD;
      patients with mucosal melanoma. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab,&#xD;
      may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of&#xD;
      tumor cells to grow and spread. Cabozantinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking&#xD;
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It works by blocking the action of an abnormal&#xD;
      protein that signals tumor cells to multiply. This helps stop the spread of tumor cells.&#xD;
      Giving nivolumab in combination with cabozantinib could prevent cancer from returning.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the efficacy of adjuvant nivolumab (480 mg every [q]4 weeks) versus nivolumab&#xD;
      plus cabozantinib (40 mg daily) in patients with mucosal melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare overall survival between the two adjuvant therapies. II. To evaluate the&#xD;
      adverse effects in each arm. III. To assess the correlation between PD-L1 expression in tumor&#xD;
      cells with survival (recurrence free survival [RFS] and overall survival [OS]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate the overall response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), progression free&#xD;
      survival (PFS), and OS of nivolumab plus cabozantinib in patients who cannot undergo gross&#xD;
      total resection of disease or have metastatic disease at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Results of the primary analysis will be examined for consistency, while taking into&#xD;
      account the stratification factors and/or covariates of baseline quality of life (QOL) and&#xD;
      fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Resectable patients are randomized to Arm 1 or Arm 2. Unresectable patients are&#xD;
      assigned to Arm 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM 1: Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and&#xD;
      cabozantinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) of each cycle. Treatment repeats every 28 days for&#xD;
      up to 13 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM 2: Patients receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and placebo PO QD of each&#xD;
      cycle. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 13 cycles in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM 3: Patients receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes and cabozantinib PO QD of each cycle.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 26 cycle in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months until disease&#xD;
      progression, and then every 6 months for up to 5 years from registration or until death.&#xD;
