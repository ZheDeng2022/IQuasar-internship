  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The revolution in treatments for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has transformed patient outcomes,&#xD;
      but many patients continue to experience life disabling pain. Even those who achieve full&#xD;
      disease remission with state-of-the-art treatments report substantially higher levels of pain&#xD;
      when compared to the general population. Researchers believe this disconnect is due to the&#xD;
      existence of pain sources that are in addition to those present in the joints. In particular,&#xD;
      the central nervous system (CNS) may have an important role in determining RA pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to a recent study, RA patients who received treatment with Olumiant (a Janus Kinase&#xD;
      (JAK) inhibitor that works by interfering with the inflammatory processes that lead to the&#xD;
      symptoms of RA) reported better and quicker pain improvements compared to those receiving&#xD;
      other types of therapy. However, this could not be explained by levels of peripheral&#xD;
      inflammation alone and remains to be fully understood. Investigators think this improvement&#xD;
      may be related to the role of the JAK pathway in the brain and that inhibition of this&#xD;
      pathway with Olumiant could normalise brain connectivity in respect to pain processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advanced brain scanning methods have already helped to identify specific regions of the brain&#xD;
      that are thought to be important in pain processing and peripheral inflammation; a) enhanced&#xD;
      functional connectivity between the Default Mode Network (DMN) and insula and b) enhanced&#xD;
      functional connectivity between the Dorsal Attention Network (DAN) and the left inferior&#xD;
      parietal lobule (LIPL). This study aims to elucidate the mechanisms of analgesic action of&#xD;
      Olumiant by examining changes in functional connectivity and glutamate levels within the CNS&#xD;
      and exploring the relationship between MRI markers, pain, clinical phenotype and peripheral&#xD;
      immune markers.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Investigators believe that RA is a mixed pain state i.e. pain pathways exist in addition to&#xD;
      established peripheral inflammatory nociceptive mechanisms. In particular, the central&#xD;
      nervous system (CNS) may have an important role in determining RA pain. Recently this group&#xD;
      were the first to delineate distinct neurobiological pain signatures in the brains of RA&#xD;
      patients by employing 3T functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI) - a&#xD;
      recent adaptation of functional MRI data that examines the synchrony of neural activity which&#xD;
      modulates the efficiency and extent of neuronal transmission between brain regions.&#xD;
      Specifically, researchers identified and replicated two distinct pain signatures: a) enhanced&#xD;
      functional connectivity between the Default Mode Network (DMN) and insula which was unrelated&#xD;
      to levels of peripheral inflammation but, intriguingly, is an established neurobiological&#xD;
      marker of fibromyalgia (an archetypal CNS determined chronic pain disorder) and b) enhanced&#xD;
      functional connectivity between the Dorsal Attention Network (DAN) and the left inferior&#xD;
      parietal lobule (LIPL)6 which was related to levels of peripheral inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-clinical experiments have not only implicated the JAK- signal transducer and activator of&#xD;
      transcription (STAT) pathway with peripheral immune system functioning but also the brain. In&#xD;
      the CNS, this pathway promotes gene expression associated with inflammation which in turn&#xD;
      generates pro-nociceptive cytokines such as TNFα. However, there is now also emerging&#xD;
      evidence to support the pathway's direct role in synaptic transmission and neurotransmitter&#xD;
      receptor modulation. Specifically, the JAK-STAT pathway appears important in&#xD;
      N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) related synaptic plasticity - a ubiquitous glutamate receptor of&#xD;
      the human brain. Their induction is selectively blocked by JAK inhibitors and JAK2 knockdown&#xD;
      abolishes NMDA functioning. Increases in glutamate and subsequent binding to NMDA receptors&#xD;
      cause chaotic and incoherent neuronal functional activity. In human studies of fibromyalgia,&#xD;
      we have consistently evidenced both elevated glutamate levels within the insula and&#xD;
      dysfunctional neural connectivity. Moreover, this group have shown that fibromyalgia&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy (pregablin), considered to reduce neural glutamate, rectifies both insular&#xD;
      glutamate and pro-nociceptive brain functional connectivity (DMN-insula). JAK inhibition&#xD;
      (JAKi) may facilitate the reduction of glutamate-NMDA binding and ultimately pain alleviation&#xD;
      by normalising the functional activity of these same neural connections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are clear practical constraints of sampling fresh human brain tissue in order to&#xD;
      interrogate these possible mechanisms. Instead, neurobiological surrogate imaging measures&#xD;
      may be employed. Glasgow benefits from the only clinical based ultra-high resolution 7T MRI&#xD;
      scanner in the UK. Unlike lesser resolutions, 7T can distinguish the resonance of glutamate&#xD;
      from other metabolites and so more precisely quantify the chemical of interest. Further, the&#xD;
      superior spatial resolution of 7T enhances capacity to indirectly measure neuronal functional&#xD;
      connectivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators hypothesise that Olumiant's mechanism of analgesic action is determined by at&#xD;
      least two factors. The first is related to those pathways seen in fibromyalgia, mediated via&#xD;
      DMN-insula connectivity and insular glutamate. The second is related to peripheral&#xD;
      inflammation, mediated via DAN-LIPL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study objectives include: 1) To evaluate the effects of Olumiant on DMN-Insula&#xD;
      connectivity and insular glutamate levels in RA (neurobiological markers of fibromyalgia). 2)&#xD;
      To evaluate the effects of Olumiant on DAN-LIPL connectivity in RA (neurobiological marker of&#xD;
      peripheral inflammation). 3) To explore the relationship between pain, clinical phenotype,&#xD;
      peripheral immune markers and their change with MRI markers indicative of CNS pathway&#xD;
      function. The study will involve participants aged over 18 years with RA who are scheduled to&#xD;
      start outpatient Olumiant as part of standard clinical practice, and who meet the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria and none of the exclusion criteria.&#xD;
