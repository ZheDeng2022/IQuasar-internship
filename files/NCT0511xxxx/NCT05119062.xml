  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a feasibility study with pilot randomized controlled trial design. A convenience&#xD;
      sample of 60 intergenerational co-parenting family units, including 60 first-time parents (60&#xD;
      mothers and 60 fathers) and 60 grandmothers (mother-in-law of mothers) will be recruited from&#xD;
      the obstetric clinics in the outpatient department of the study hospital, with 30 family&#xD;
      units of each in the intervention group and control group respectively. Participants who are&#xD;
      recruited will be randomly assigned to the intervention or control group by a research&#xD;
      assistant based on the sequential enrollment list. Participants in the control group will&#xD;
      receive usual care. Those who are randomized to the intervention group will receive the&#xD;
      intergenerational co-parenting program in addition to the usual care.&#xD;

      the obstetric clinics in the outpatient department of the study hospital, with 30 family&#xD;
      units of each in the intervention group and control group respectively. A sequential&#xD;
      enrollment list linked to a random number sequence will be generated by a statistician.&#xD;
      Participants who are recruited will be randomly assigned to the intervention or control group&#xD;
      by a research assistant based on the sequential enrollment list. Participants in the control&#xD;
      group will receive usual care. Those who are randomized to the intervention group will&#xD;
      receive the intergenerational co-parenting program in addition to the usual care, including 3&#xD;
      weekly antenatal sessions (start from 33-35 weeks gestation) and 2 weekly postnatal sessions&#xD;
      (start from the first week after discharge from hospital). The essential components and focus&#xD;
      of the intergenerational co-parenting program were developed based on the themes identified&#xD;
      from the two qualitative studies, the systematic review of co-parenting interventions, and&#xD;
      the proposed intergenerational co-parenting model. The intervention will be delivered online&#xD;
      through an education platform of the study hospital. The acceptability, feasibility of the&#xD;
      intergeneration co-parenting program will be examined. In addtion, the preliminary effects of&#xD;
      such program on the intergenerational co-parenting relationship between mothers and&#xD;
      grandmothers reported by mothers (primary outcome), and on the secondary outcomes: the&#xD;
      psychological well-being of parents and grandmothers, the co-parenting relationship between&#xD;
      parents, parenting stress and parenting self-efficacy of parents at 6 weeks, and 3 months&#xD;
      postpartum will be assessed.&#xD;

    <description>The Chinese version of Co-parenting relationship Scale (Feinberg et al., 2012; Li &amp; Wei, 2018) will be used to assess the intergenerational co-parenting relationship between mothers and grandmothers reported by mothers. There are 38 items in the Chinese version of CRS. The total score ranges from 38 to 266. The Exploratory Factor Analysis adopted 7 factors. The internal consistency ranged from 0.65 to 0.87, the split half reliability was 0.60 to 0.86, and the test-retest reliability was 0.38 to 0.71.

    <measure>Parenting stress of parents</measure>

    <description>The parenting stress of parents will be measured using the Short Version of the Parenting Stress Index (Abidin &amp; Abidin, 1990). The subscale of parental distress (PD) (12 items) and parent-child dysfunctional interaction (PCDI) (12 items) will be used in this study (Leung et al., 2005; Liu, Chen, Yeh, &amp; Hsieh, 2012). The content validity of the Chinese version was 0.86 and the reliability was 0.91 after the removal of the DC subscale (Liu et al., 2012). Respondents are asked to rate the items using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Total scores of these two subscales range from 24 to 120, with scores ranging from 12 to 60 for each subscale (Liu et al., 2012). A higher score predicts higher parenting stress.</description>

    <description>The Parenting Sense of Competence Scale (Gibaud-Wallston &amp; Wandersman, 2001) will be used to assess the parenting self-efficacy of parents. This 17-item scale consists of two subscales, and has been widely used for assessments of parenting self-efficacy. Each item is rated from 1 to 6, with a total socre ranging from 17 to 102. A higher score indicates higher parenting self-efficacy. The Cronbach's alpha was 0.85 for the total scale in the Chinese version, and 0.80 and 0.77 for the subscales of Efficacy and Satisfaction, respectively. The test-retest reliability was 0.87. Good construct validity was also confirmed in the Chinese version via factor analyses, where 82% of the factors were loaded (Ngai, Chan, &amp; Holroyd, 2007).</description>
