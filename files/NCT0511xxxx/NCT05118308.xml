  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will directly compare the endoscopic ultrasound guided approach to obtain adequate&#xD;
      liver biopsies and portal pressure gradient measurements to the current standard of care&#xD;
      which uses the transjugular approach.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current guidelines recommend that when a hepatic venous pressure gradient and a liver biopsy&#xD;
      are needed, the liver biopsy should be done by the transjugular approach during the same&#xD;
      session. A major limitation is that liver biopsies obtained by the transjugular approach meet&#xD;
      quality criteria proposed by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (at&#xD;
      least 2-3cm with at least 11 complete portal tracts) in only 40% of cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have shown that endoscopic ultrasound-guided liver biopsy (EUS-LB) can achieve&#xD;
      a high rate of adequate liver biopsies using the same strict criteria described above. In&#xD;
      addition, a novel endoscopic-ultrasound adapted manometer allows the safe and accurate&#xD;
      measurement of portal pressure gradient (PPG) which correlates well with hepatic venous&#xD;
      pressures (HVPG) obtained by the transjugular approach. Unfortunately to this day, no&#xD;
      randomized controlled trials has compared the EUS-LB and PPG vs TJ-LB and HVPG directly.&#xD;

    <description>This procedure will be performed by an experienced interventional radiologist who will be supported by a radiology technician and nurse. Transjugular hepatic venous pressure gradient measurement will be performed using standard procedure. Following this, a transjugular liver biopsy will be obtained using an 18-gauge transjugular liver biopsy needle.</description>

    <description>A linear echoendoscope is inserted with the patient under conscious sedation. Using a through the scope 25-gauge needle connected to a digital manometer, portal and hepatic veins will be punctured under EUS guidance from a trans-gastric/hepatic approach. Following this, EUS-Liver biopsy is then performed immediately following EUS-PPG using a 19-gauge fine needle biopsy (FNB).</description>
