  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Patients with a minimum age of 75&#xD;
      years who consult at the dermatology department of the Ghent University Hospital and who are&#xD;
      diagnosed with minimum one lesion suspicious for a low-risk basal cell carcinoma will be&#xD;
      asked to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: Basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) represent 70% of all skin cancers. These tumors do&#xD;
      not metastasize but are locally invasive if left untreated. There is a high incidence of BCC&#xD;
      in elderly and clinicians frequently face important treatment dilemmas. The approach to BCC&#xD;
      in elderly should be investigated thoroughly, since current data on health-related quality of&#xD;
      life, complication risks and biological behavior of these tumors is absent, and most&#xD;
      guidelines are based on studies in young patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The investigators will examine the possibility of not treating all BCCs by&#xD;
      collecting data on the in vivo biological behavior of low-risk basal cell carcinomas in&#xD;
      elderly patients with state-of-the-art imaging techniques. The investigators want to combine&#xD;
      tumor characteristics with patient profiles, in order to estimate whether a chosen treatment&#xD;
      will positively affect the patients' quality of life within a predetermined timeframe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Randomized controlled trial (RCT) with study visits every 6 to 12 months for a&#xD;
      total follow-up period of 36 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Patients consulting at the Department of Dermatology of the Ghent&#xD;
      University Hospital with the minimum age of 75 years and a new diagnosis of (a) low-risk&#xD;
      basal cell carcinoma(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Evaluation of the impact on the quality of life and the complication risks in&#xD;
      both study arms. In addition, survival data will be gathered in both study arms. In the&#xD;
      non-treatment arm, there will be an evaluation of the biological behavior of these low-risk&#xD;
      basal cell carcinomas using in vivo imaging devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the treatment arm will receive standard care. Patients in the non-treatment arm&#xD;
      will be closely monitored: the tumor will be evaluated using non-invasive imaging devices.&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to fill in a questionnaire concerning their HrQoL at consecutive time&#xD;
      points. Also patient-reported side effects will be evaluated via a questionnaire. The&#xD;
      investigators will compare standard treatment versus non-treatment (1:1 allocation) in a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects can withdraw from participating in this study at any time for any reason without any&#xD;
      consequences.&#xD;

    <description>Patients in the T-arm will receive diagnostic investigation(s) as in standard care. This includes clinical and dermoscopic examination and (in most cases) a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis of a BCC. Patients will be asked to fill out a questionnaire (Q) concerning their HrQoL. Important is the possible exclusion of patients (when the biopsy shows the lesion is not a BCC) in this step.&#xD;
Patients will receive treatment of their BCC in accordance with the standard treatment regimen. The treatment will be performed by an independent dermatologist of the investigator's department who is blinded and not aware of the patient's participation in this study. After the treatment, a new Q will be sent out to capture the HrQoL and possible patient-reported side effects. Afterwards, the patients will be followed every 6 to 12 months for 36 months with a clinical evaluation of the previously treated skin site, evaluation of possible complications and the HrQoL and complications Qs.</description>

    <description>Patients allocated to the n-T-arm will receive diagnostic investigations by non-invasive imaging techniques to confirm the diagnosis of a BCC. Patients will be asked to fill out a Q concerning their HrQoL. Important to point out is the possible exclusion of certain patients (when the imaging shows the lesion is not a BCC) in this step.&#xD;
The patients in this arm will be followed every 6 to 12 months for 36 months. Every study visit there will be a clinical evaluation of the tumor. At the follow-up visits of 6, 12, 24 and 36 months a new documentation of the tumor will take place with in vivo imaging. At these time-points, patients will also be asked to fill out the HrQoL Q and complications Q.&#xD;
Because of ethical reasons, a maximum tolerable diameter of the tumor has been defined in advance: BCCs in the non-treatment arm that reach a diameter of 4cm will be excluded and will receive treatment.</description>
