  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Erectile dysfunction (ED) affects up to 20% of men and is a growing problem with advancing&#xD;
      age. There are many causes that contribute to ED, including the concomitant use of&#xD;
      prescription drugs for health problems, including hypertension, or diseases such as diabetes.&#xD;
      causes an up-regulation or increased local tissue expression of these proteins. This study&#xD;
      follows the demonstration of the effectiveness of using BES in the treatment of ED. The aim&#xD;
      of this study will be to examine the potentially additive effect of adding a third arm to the&#xD;
      previous protocol to include the addition of 4 new target proteins to VEGF, including&#xD;
      endothelial nitric oxide (eNOS), stromal-derived factor 1 (SDF-1), insulin-like growth factor&#xD;
      (IGF) and follistatin.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      For this randomized clinical trial, 10 patients from a private Urology clinic will be&#xD;
      selected. Each patient will serve as their own two-month documentation control using the&#xD;
      validated IIEF-5 and EHS questionnaires. The intervention period will last 8 weeks. And 6&#xD;
      months of follow-up after the end of treatment to see how long the benefit lasts without&#xD;
      continued treatment. The assessment will be carried out before the intervention period&#xD;
      (pre-intervention) and after the intervention period (post-intervention and follow-up) for&#xD;
      all participants. All patients who, after medical consultation, are diagnosed with erectile&#xD;
      dysfunction and who meet the inclusion criteria will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Erectile function will be assessed using the validated questionnaire IIEF-5. The instrument&#xD;
      will be completed by a blind researcher and the technique will be applied by a&#xD;
      physiotherapist trained in the area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Erectile dysfunction (ED) was defined as the inability to achieve and/or maintain sufficient&#xD;
      penile erection for satisfactory sexual performance 11 for at least 6 months, accompanied by&#xD;
      an IIEF5 questionnaire score of less than 22 points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients were in the supine position, in a lithotomy position. They will undergo&#xD;
      trichotomy at the site of placement of the self-adhesive surface electrodes. Each patient&#xD;
      will have their own pair of electrodes that will be used until the end of therapy, and they&#xD;
      will be discarded after the end of the sessions. The intervention will consist of the&#xD;
      application of low intensity transcutaneous penile electrical stimulation for 45 minutes&#xD;
      using frequency.&#xD;
