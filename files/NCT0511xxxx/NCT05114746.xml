      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy, tolerability, safety, pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      (PK) and dosimetry of 177Lu-PSMA-617, in participants with progressive prostate-specific&#xD;
      membrane antigen (PSMA)-positive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) in&#xD;
      Japan. Furthermore, the safety, PK and dosimetry of 68Ga-PSMA-11 (PSMA imaging agent) are&#xD;
      assessed in the same study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open label, multicenter, single arm, phase II study to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy, tolerability, safety, PK and dosimetry of 177Lu-PSMA-617 in participants with&#xD;
      progressive PSMA-positive mCRPC in Japan. Furthermore, the safety, PK, and dosimetry of&#xD;
      68Ga-PSMA-11 (PSMA imaging agent) are also evaluated in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study consists of two populations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Post-taxane population:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The post-taxane population will include men with PSMA-positive mCRPC who received at&#xD;
           least one ARDT (for example enzalutamide, abiraterone etc.) and were previously treated&#xD;
           with at least one, but no more than two taxane regimens. Participants treated with only&#xD;
           1 prior taxane regimen are eligible if the participant's physician deems the&#xD;
           participants unsuitable to receive a second taxane regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pre-taxane population; The pre-taxane population will include men with PSMA-positive&#xD;
           mCRPC who were previously treated with one ARDT as last treatment and have not been&#xD;
           exposed to a taxane-containing regimen in the CRPC or HSPC settings and for whom it is&#xD;
           considered appropriate to delay taxane-based chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a 3-part study: Part 1 (a safety run-in part), Part 2 (post-taxane part) and Part 3&#xD;
      (pre-taxane part).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Part 1 (safety run-in part) will confirm the tolerability and safety of recommended&#xD;
           regimen, once every 6-weeks, 7.4 GBq of the 177Lu-PSMA-617. Minimum of 3 participants as&#xD;
           177Lu-PSMA-617 tolerability evaluable participants will be enrolled. Dosimetry and PK&#xD;
           assessments of 177Lu-PSMA-617 are mandatory for participants enrolled in this part.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Part 2 (post-taxane part) will evaluate the efficacy, safety, PK and dosimetry of&#xD;
           177Lu-PSMA-617 plus BSC/BSoC, as well as safety, PK, and dosimetry of 68Ga-PSMA-11 in&#xD;
           post-taxane participants with PSMA-positive mCRPC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Part 3 (pre-taxane part) will evaluate the efficacy, safety, PK and dosimetry of&#xD;
           177Lu-PSMA-617, as well as safety, PK, and dosimetry of 68Ga-PSMA-11 in taxane na√Øve&#xD;
           participants with PSMA-positive mCRPC&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately total 35 participants are planned for screening, and total 28 participants will&#xD;
      be enrolled in the treatment part (Part 1, Part 2 and Part 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will consist of 3 periods: screening period, treatment period, and long term&#xD;
      follow up.&#xD;

    <description>EQ-5D-5L is a standardized participant completed questionnaire that measures health-related quality of life and translates that score into an index value or utility score. EQ-5D-5L consists of two components: a health state profile and an optional visual analogue scale (VAS). EQ-5D health state profile is comprised of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: 1= no problems, 2= slight problems, 3= moderate problems, 4= severe problems, and 5= extreme problems. Higher scores indicated greater levels of problems across each of the five dimensions.</description>

The total score range is between 1-108, higher scores indicates better for total score and subscale scores. PCS is a 12-item prostate cancer subscale that asks about symptoms and problems specific to prostate cancer (Range 0-48, higher scores better). The FACT-P total score is the sum of all 5 subscale scores of the FACT-P questionnaire and ranges from 0-156. Higher scores indicate higher degree of functioning and better quality of life.</description>

    <description>The BPI-SF is a publicly available instrument to assess the pain and includes severity and interference scores. BPI-SF is an 11-item selfreport questionnaire that is designed to assess the severity and impact of pain on daily functions of a participant. Pain severity score is a mean value for BPI-SF questions 3, 4, 5 and 6 (questions inquiring about the extent of pain, where the extent is ranked from 0 [no pain] to 10 [pain as bad as you can imagine]). Pain severity progression is defined as an increase in score of 30% or greater from baseline without decrease in analgesic use.</description>

             confirmation of prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have a positive 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT scan, as determined by the&#xD;
             sponsor's central reader, before the enrollment to 177Lu-PSMA-617 treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have a castrate level of serum/plasma testosterone (&lt;50 ng/dL or&#xD;
             &lt;1.7 nmol/L).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Post-taxane population only: Participants must have received at least one ARDT (for&#xD;
             example enzalutamide, abiraterone, apalutamide, or darolutamide, etc.) in either the&#xD;
             hormone-sensitive/castrate-resistant or non-metastatic/metastatic prostate cancer&#xD;
             setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pre-taxane population only: Participants must have received one prior approved ARDT&#xD;
             (for example, abiraterone, enzalutamide, darolutamide, or apalutamide, etc.) and have&#xD;
             documented progression on therapy and be a candidate for additional treatment with an&#xD;
             alternate ARDT as assessed by the treating physician&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Post-taxane population only: Participants must have been previously treated with at&#xD;
             least 1, but no more than 2 prior taxane regimens. A taxane regimen is defined as a&#xD;
             minimum exposure of 2 cycles of a taxane. If a participant has received only 1 taxane&#xD;
             regimen, the participant is eligible if :&#xD;
&#xD;
             a. The participant's physician deems him unsuitable to receive a second taxane regimen&#xD;
             (e.g., frailty assessed by geriatric or health status evaluation or intolerance,&#xD;
             etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have progressive mCRPC. Documented progressive mCRPC will be based&#xD;

&#xD;
               2. Soft-tissue progression defined as an increase ‚â•20% in the sum of the diameter&#xD;
                  (SOD) (short axis for nodal lesions and long axis for non-nodal lesions) of all&#xD;
                  target lesions based on the smallest SOD since treatment started or the&#xD;

             included) within 28 days prior to day of the enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pre-taxane population: Prior treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy for castration&#xD;
             resistant or castrate sensitive prostate cancer (e.g., taxanes, platinum,&#xD;
             estramustine, vincristine, methotrexate, etc.), immunotherapy or biological therapy&#xD;
             [including monoclonal antibodies]) [Note: Taxane exposure (maximum 6 cycles) in the&#xD;
             adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting is allowed if 12 months have elapsed since completion&#xD;
             of this adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy]&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known hypersensitivity to the components of 177Lu-PSMA-617, 68Ga-PSMA-11 or excipients&#xD;

             radiotherapy, gamma knife) and be neurologically stable, asymptomatic, and not&#xD;
             receiving corticosteroids for the purposes of maintaining neurologic integrity.&#xD;
