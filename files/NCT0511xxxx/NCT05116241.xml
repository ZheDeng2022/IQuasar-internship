    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the safety and immunogenicity of the BPZE1 live, attenuated pertussis&#xD;
      vaccine, intended to prevent nasopharyngeal colonization and pertussis disease, and compares&#xD;
      BPZE1 vaccine vs Boostrix vaccine vs both BPZE1 and Boostrix vaccines. This is a&#xD;
      multi-center, randomized, placebo- and active-comparator-controlled study in healthy,&#xD;
      school-age children with a 6-month safety follow-up after the first vaccination.&#xD;

      This multi-center, randomized, placebo- and active-comparator-controlled study evaluates the&#xD;
      safety and immunogenicity of the BPZE1 live attenuated pertussis vaccine, intended to prevent&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal colonization and pertussis disease. Healthy school-age children will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to 1 of 3 different study treatment groups to receive the intranasal BPZE1&#xD;
      vaccine, the intramuscular Boostrix vaccine, or both. Subjects will first receive the&#xD;
      intranasal vaccine (BPZE1 or placebo) using a small, cone-shaped device that attaches to a&#xD;
      syringe and sprays the vaccine into the nose. After a 10-minute waiting period, subjects will&#xD;
      receive the intramuscular vaccine (Boostrix or placebo) in the upper arm. As this is the&#xD;
      first study in school-age children, a staggered enrollment is planned with the first 45&#xD;
      subjects in the older age group of 11-16 years designated as the safety lead-in cohort. After&#xD;
      reactogenicity results from the first 7 days after vaccination of the safety lead-in cohort&#xD;
      are reviewed by the safety monitoring committee, the remainder of the subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled. Subjects who choose to take part in a small sub-study of revaccination/attenuated&#xD;
      challenge will receive BPZE1 intranasal vaccine (open-label) 3 months after the first&#xD;
      vaccination. Safety will be monitored for 6 months after the first vaccination.&#xD;
