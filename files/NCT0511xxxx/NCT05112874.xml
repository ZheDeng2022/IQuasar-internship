  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adaptive Biotechnologies has developed a clinical test called T-Detect COVID Test that can&#xD;
      identify a T-cell response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, indicating recent or prior infection This&#xD;
      study aims to evaluate the potential cross-reactivity of the T-Detect COVID test in&#xD;
      participants presenting with viral upper respiratory tract infections within the assay's&#xD;
      intended use population and testing positive for seasonal coronavirus.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prospective ascertainment of a minimum of 10 individuals exhibiting symptoms of viral upper&#xD;
      respiratory tract infections, between the ages of 18-89 residing within the United States and&#xD;
      being tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection during the 2021-2022 cold and flu season (~Nov. 2021 -&#xD;
      May 2022).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete an electronic screening questionnaire to determine eligibility, be&#xD;
      consented, and scheduled for a study visit that will be conducted by study staff or mobile&#xD;
      phlebotomist. The identification and recruitment of participants will protect privacy and be&#xD;
      free of undue influence. Biological samples, including blood samples and nasopharyngeal&#xD;
      swabs, will be collected via mobile phlebotomy in participant's homes with proper safety&#xD;
      precautions in place. Study metadata and questionnaire information will be self-reported&#xD;
      and/or recorded by study staff as applicable.&#xD;
