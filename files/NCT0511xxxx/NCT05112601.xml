  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial compares how well nivolumab with or without ipilimumab works to shrink&#xD;
      cancer masses and prevent additional growth in patients with deficient mismatch repair system&#xD;
      (MMR) endometrial cancer that has come back after a period of improvement (recurrent).&#xD;
      Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) mismatch repair (MMR) is a system for recognizing and repairing&#xD;
      DNA errors and damage. Tumors that have evidence of mismatch repair deficiency tend to be&#xD;
      more sensitive to immunotherapy. Giving monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab and&#xD;
      ipilimumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the&#xD;
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread than nivolumab alone.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess efficacy in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) for immunotherapy with dual&#xD;
      immune checkpoint blockade (nivolumab/ipilimumab) versus (vs.) monotherapy (nivolumab) in&#xD;
      patients with recurrent mismatch repair (MMR) deficient endometrial carcinoma with measurable&#xD;
      or non-measurable (detectable) disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the overall survival (OS) as estimated from time of enrollment to last&#xD;
      follow-up or death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the objective response rate by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors&#xD;
      (RECIST) 1.1 in those with measurable disease at start of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate progression-free survival at 6 months. IV. To evaluate the nature, frequency&#xD;
      and degree of toxicity as assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events&#xD;
      (CTCAE) version (v) 5.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To evaluate PFS and objective response rate in patients with prior anti-PD1/PDL1 therapy&#xD;
      and compare efficacy of dual immune checkpoint inhibition vs. anti-PD1 monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized into 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 of each cycle&#xD;
      and ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1 every other cycle. Treatment with nivolumab and&#xD;
      ipilimumab repeats every 3 weeks for up to 8 cycles in the absence of disease progression,&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity, or complete response (CR). Patients then receive nivolumab alone on&#xD;
      day 1 of each cycle. Cycles repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression,&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity, or CR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1 of each cycle. Treatment&#xD;
      repeats every 3 weeks for up to 8 cycles, then every 4 weeks thereafter in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or CR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Patients achieving CR on Arm I or II receive nivolumab for 12 months in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years then every 6 months for 3 years.&#xD;

    <time_frame>From study entry to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first, or date of last contact if neither progression nor death has occurred, assessed up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The test statistic used for decision making is the stratified, standardized log-rank statistic (Z) based on PFS. For the safety lead-in analysis, the primary endpoint is the observation of at least one dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in the first 3 cycles of treatment. Patients are classified as having a DLT in 3 cycles or receiving adequate treatment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Will be assessed when the PFS data are mature. The null hypothesis will be that the hazard of death in regimen 1 is equal to the hazard of death in regimen 2. That is, Ho: HR = 1.00. The alternative will be that Ha: HR &lt; 1.00 (regimen 1 to 2). The number of deaths is unknown.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective tumor response (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as the frequency of patients who have either a partial or complete response by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. The number of patients with responses will be tabulated by the treatment they were randomized to. Fisher's Exact Test will be used to test the hypothesis that the probabilities of response in each arm is the same. ORR will be evaluated only in patients who had measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 before starting treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free survival (PFS) at 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>From study entry to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first, or date of last contact if neither progression nor death has occurred, assessed at 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>A patient who survives at least 6 months progression-free will be considered to have had a successful outcome. Those who progress or die within 6 months are considered treatment failures, and those who survive progression-free for less than 6 months will be considered to have an unknown outcome or indeterminate. If the patient's status cannot be determined, she will be moved to the &quot;failure&quot; status for analysis. Like tumor response, the hypothesis of equivalent probabilities will be assessed with Fisher's Exact Test.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Will be assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). Will be tabulated by frequency and severity by treatment regimen. The treatment regimens will be compared by classifying the toxicities as severe or not and tested for equivalent probabilities by Fisher's Exact Test or whether the estimated probabilities of severe toxicities diverge by more than 10%.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with measurable or non-measurable (detectable) recurrent endometrial cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable disease will be defined and monitored by RECIST v 1.1. Measurable disease&#xD;
             is defined per RECIST 1.1 criteria as at least one lesion that can be accurately&#xD;
             measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded). Each lesion must&#xD;
             be &gt;= 10 mm when measured by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
             (MRI). Lymph nodes must be &gt;= 15 mm in short axis when measured by CT or MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-measurable (detectable) disease in a patient is defined in this protocol per&#xD;
             RECIST 1.1 criteria as one who does not have measurable disease but has at least one&#xD;
             of the following conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest&#xD;
                  diameter &lt;10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with &gt;= 10 to &lt; 15 mm short axis),&#xD;
                  are considered non-measurable disease&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Ascites and/or pleural effusion attributed to tumor&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Solid and/or cystic abnormalities on radiographic imaging that do not meet RECIST&#xD;
                  1.1 definitions for target lesions&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have endometrial cancer with deficient mismatch repair system. All&#xD;
             patients must have institutional immunohistochemistry (IHC) and/or microsatellite&#xD;
             instability (MSI) testing to determine mismatch repair (MMR) status. MMR deficiency is&#xD;
             defined as lack of expression of one or more mismatch repair proteins (MLH1, PMS2,&#xD;
             MSH2, MSH6, EPCAM) by immunohistochemistry and/or presence of microsatellite&#xD;
             instability high using the National Cancer Institute (NCI)-5plex and Promega v1.2&#xD;
             assays, or institutional standards (e.g. next-generation sequencing [NGS] panel)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Method(s) of detection of MMR deficiency will be recorded for each patient. An&#xD;
                  institutional pathology report, and additional reports if available, documenting&#xD;
                  these results must be submitted. Patients with &quot;equivocal&quot; results on MMR testing&#xD;
                  by immunohistochemistry may be eligible if they have documented evidence of&#xD;
                  microsatellite instability by MSI testing or by next generation sequencing&#xD;
                  assays. MMR testing by IHC may be used to resolve equivocal/indeterminate MSI&#xD;
                  results&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologic confirmation of the original primary tumor is required (submission of&#xD;

             palliative radiation therapy. All radiation therapy must be completed at least 4 weeks&#xD;
             prior to registration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may have received prior hormonal therapy for treatment of endometrial cancer.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients must have recovered from effects of recent surgery, radiotherapy or&#xD;
             chemotherapy. At least 4 weeks must have elapsed since major surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  As clinically indicated, patients with known history or current symptoms of cardiac&#xD;
             disease, or history of treatment with cardiotoxic agents, should have a clinical risk&#xD;
             assessment of cardiac function using the New York Heart Association Functional&#xD;
             Classification. To be eligible for this trial, patients should be class 2B or better&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The effects of nivolumab, and ipilimumab on the developing human fetus are unknown.&#xD;
             For this reason and because nivolumab and ipilimumab are known to be teratogenic,&#xD;
             women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) must agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for&#xD;
             5 months after the last dose of investigational drug. Women of childbearing potential&#xD;
             must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or&#xD;
             equivalent units of human chorionic gonadotropin [HCG]) within 24 hours prior to the&#xD;

             potential (i.e., who are postmenopausal or surgically sterile) do not require&#xD;
             contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  WOCBP is defined as any female who has experienced menarche and who has not&#xD;
                  undergone surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy) or who&#xD;
                  is not postmenopausal. Menopause is defined clinically as 12 months of amenorrhea&#xD;
                  in a woman over 45 in the absence of other biological or physiological causes. In&#xD;
                  addition, women under the age of 55 must have a documented serum follicle&#xD;
                  stimulating hormone (FSH) level less than 40 mIU/mL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does&#xD;
             not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the&#xD;
             investigational regimen are eligible for this trial&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with treated brain metastases are eligible if follow-up brain imaging after&#xD;
             central nervous system (CNS)-directed therapy shows no evidence of progression and the&#xD;
             patient is stable off steroids for at least one month&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient or a legally authorized representative must provide study-specific&#xD;
             informed consent prior to study entry and, for patients treated in the United States&#xD;
             (U.S.), authorization permitting release of personal health information&#xD;
&#xD;

             presence of target organ involvement and potential need for systemic treatment but&#xD;
             should otherwise be eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a diagnosis of endometrial serous carcinoma or carcinosarcoma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who received prior anti-PD1/PD-L1 therapy and had grade 3-4 or recurring&#xD;
