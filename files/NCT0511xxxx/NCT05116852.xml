      This study aims to analyze the needs of those who have lost a loved one to opioid-related&#xD;
      death and/or those currently supporting a loved one in treatment for Opioid Use Disorder.&#xD;
      Mental health status related to the death or support of a loved one will be assessed through&#xD;
      a survey and through the use of several modules of the CAT-MH (computerized adaptive&#xD;

      This study aims to establish the level of needs in the community among those who have lost&#xD;
      loved ones to opioid overdose and/or currently support those in opioid addiction recovery.&#xD;
      This study aims to analyze the needs of those who have lost a loved one to opioid-related&#xD;
      death and/or those currently supporting a loved one in treatment for Opioid Use Disorder. The&#xD;
      study will evaluate the mental health status for each study participant through a primary&#xD;
      survey as well as current participant mental health status through the use of several modules&#xD;
      of the CAT-MH adaptive testing questionnaire. CAT-MH will be used to rapidly measure severity&#xD;
      levels of depression, anxiety, and substance use risk after participants complete the primary&#xD;
      survey. The primary survey assesses the immediate impact of overdose death by a loved one and&#xD;
      recognition of the onset of opioid addiction in the years after the event on family and&#xD;
      community members. The primary survey will compare the impact of loss and/or recovery support&#xD;
      on mental health and substance use at specified time points before and after the loss and/or&#xD;
      an individual finding out about a loved one's opioid addiction. The primary survey will also&#xD;
      evaluate attitudes in this population about mindfulness and self-compassion skills training,&#xD;
      openness to technology and various treatment options, current and past levels of depression,&#xD;
      anxiety and grief, as well as thematic areas of need specific to those who have lost a loved&#xD;
      one to opioid overdose and/or currently support a loved one in opioid addiction recovery.&#xD;
