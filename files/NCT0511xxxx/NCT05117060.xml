  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an up to 22-week clinical study in adult participants with moderate to severe atopic&#xD;
      dermatitis (AD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to test a new tablet (LEO 152020) to see if it works to treat AD&#xD;
      and what the side effects are when compared with a placebo tablet with no medical ingredient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, there will be a 16-week treatment period during which the participants will&#xD;
      be asked to take the tablets. The participants will regularly visit the clinic for tests and&#xD;
      the study doctor will evaluate their AD. The participants will also be asked to answer&#xD;
      questions about their AD symptoms, itch, sleep, and quality of life.&#xD;

    <masking_description>The outcome assessor is considered to be the person/people who will assess the outcome of the data/study and will in this study therefore be the sponsor.&#xD;
To ensure masking across the interventions, each dose of treatment in the LEO 152020 tablet - Dose regimen 1 and LEO 152020 tablet - Dose regimen 2 arms will consist of a combination of LEO 152020 and LEO 152020 placebo tablets. In these arms, placebo will be used as a masking aid and is therefore considered neither a control nor an intervention.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in EASI from baseline to Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) is a validated measure used in clinical trials to evaluate the extent and severity of atopic dermatitis. EASI is a composite score ranging from 0 to 72 with higher scores indicating a more extensive or severe condition.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of adverse events from baseline to Week 16+3 days per subject</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 to Week 16+3 days</time_frame>
    <description>Only treatment-emergent adverse events will be reported for this outcome measure.&#xD;
An adverse event will be considered treatment emergent if occurring after the first dose of treatment (Week 0) and up until 3 days after the last dose of treatment (Week 16+3 days for a participant completing the 16-week treatment period).</description>
