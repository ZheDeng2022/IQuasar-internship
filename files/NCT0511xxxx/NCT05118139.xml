  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label, parallel, three-study-group investigation to evaluate the&#xD;
      puffing patterns of healthy adult consumers of tobacco products switching from a usual brand&#xD;
      (UB) Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) product to the ENDS Investigational Product&#xD;
      (IP), over a 9-day ambulatory period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Potential subjects may complete a pre-screening interview and will complete a Screening Visit&#xD;
      to assess their eligibility. Based on meeting eligibility requirements, subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled into the study either on the same day of their Screening Visit or return to the&#xD;
      clinic on another day to complete the Enrollment Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be assigned to one of three nicotine concentrations of the IP based on their&#xD;
      scheduled Enrollment Visit to the clinic. Once enrolled, the subjects will be assigned to one&#xD;
      of the flavor variants of the IP after sampling or trying flavors, within the assigned&#xD;
      nicotine concentration, and determining which flavor that they would like to use for the&#xD;
      length of the study. Once a particular flavor group has reached full enrollment, that flavor&#xD;
      will no longer be available for sampling and selection. Subjects will be instructed not to&#xD;
      use their UB ENDS products during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Enrollment Visit, subjects will be provided a Power Unit, Cartridges for their&#xD;
      assigned product, a Product Use and Behavior (PUB) instrument, and an electronic device. The&#xD;
      electronic device will have the PUB application installed for topography data capture and PUB&#xD;
      data transmission. Based upon their UB ENDS usage, subjects will be given a sufficient amount&#xD;
      of their assigned IP cartridges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be instructed to use their assigned IP in place of their UB ENDS during the&#xD;
      9-day study period (including a 2-day IP acclimation period followed by a 7-day product use&#xD;
      evaluation period). Subjects will be allowed to use non-ENDS tobacco- or nicotine-containing&#xD;
      products according to their normal use pattern. The PUB instrument will collect puffing&#xD;
      topography data throughout the product use period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the 2-day IP acclimation period, subjects will receive a phone call from the&#xD;
      clinic to assess IP compliance and to ensure that they are not using their UB ENDS. During&#xD;
      the following Days 3-9 evaluation period, subjects will receive a phone call to remind them&#xD;
      of guidelines for using their assigned IP and to document adverse events (AEs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the conclusion of the 9-day ambulatory period, the subjects will return to the clinic,&#xD;
      return the Power Unit, any associated Accessory USB Charger, all used and unused IP&#xD;
      cartridges, the corresponding PUB instrument and its charger, and the electronic device. Each&#xD;
      subject will complete all End of Study procedures including completing the Product Evaluation&#xD;
      Scale (PES) questionnaire and two additional questionnaires to assess the degree of overall&#xD;
      product liking and intention to use the product. The subjects will then be discharged from&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Able to read, understand, and willing to sign an informed consent form (ICF) and&#xD;
             complete questionnaires written in English.&#xD;

             primary product.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Must have used 2 or more cartridges per week over the last 30 days. Brief periods of&#xD;
             abstinence due to illness, quit attempt (prior to 30 days of the Screening Visit), or&#xD;
             clinical study participation (prior to 30 days of the Screening Visit) will be allowed&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Scheduled treatment for asthma currently or within the past consecutive 12 months&#xD;
             prior to the Screening Visit. As-needed treatment, such as inhalers, may be included&#xD;

             cell/squamous cell carcinoma that has been surgically and/or cryogenically removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Use of any medication or substance that aids in smoking cessation, including but not&#xD;
             limited to any nicotine replacement therapy (NRT, e.g., nicotine gum, lozenge, patch),&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. Participation in another clinical trial within (≤) 30 days prior to signing the ICF&#xD;
             unless allowed at the discretion of the Principal Investigator (PI). The 30-day window&#xD;
             for each subject will be derived from the date of the last study event in the previous&#xD;
             study to the time of signing the ICF in the current study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Females who have a positive pregnancy test, or who are pregnant, are breastfeeding, or&#xD;
             intend to become pregnant during the course of the study.&#xD;

             contraception or hormone replacement therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. A positive urine drug screen without evidence of prescribed corresponding concomitant&#xD;
             medication(s) at the Screening or Enrollment Visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Postpones a decision to quit using tobacco- or nicotine-containing products in order&#xD;
             to participate in this study or a previous attempt within (≤) 30 days prior to signing&#xD;

&#xD;
         12. Drinks more than 21 servings of alcoholic beverages per week or has a positive test&#xD;
             for alcohol result at the Screening or Enrollment Visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Employed by a tobacco- or nicotine-manufacturing company, the study site, or handles&#xD;
             tobacco- or nicotine-containing products as part of their job.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Determined by the PI to be inappropriate for this study.&#xD;
