  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim is to do a feasibility and refinement trial to assess the safety and comfort of the&#xD;
      robotic device and their preliminary effect on muscular activity during the performance of&#xD;
      activities of daily living.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was carried out with 10 stroke participants who had to carry out a series of 10&#xD;
      functional tasks with and without the suit over 3 sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results are encouraging and show the potential of using wearable robotic devices in a&#xD;
      clinical setting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each participant completed 3 ninety-minute long sessions at CART over the course of a week.&#xD;
      All participants were closely supervised by 1 occupational therapist and 1 engineer involved&#xD;
      in the development of the devices. In the first session, screening of the patient was&#xD;
      performed, where the patient's demographics and clinical parameters were collected, including&#xD;
      the grip strength of the affected hand measured by a hand dynamometer taking the mean of 2&#xD;
      attempts, and MOCA, FMA and MAS scores. Afterwards, a familiarisation phase was conducted,&#xD;
      where the participant trialled the robotic devices to understand their mechanisms and learn&#xD;
      how to use them. This phase also allowed the researchers to adjust the fitting of the&#xD;
      exoskeletons and tuning the control algorithm of the elbow exoskeleton to the biomechanics of&#xD;
      each user, in order to achieve best comfort and assistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants were instructed to perform a series of elbow/finger flexion and extension&#xD;
      movements to understand how to control the exoskeletons. The participants also interacted&#xD;
      with different objects (cup, cube, ball) to adjust the positioning of the anchor points in&#xD;
      the glove to the position the participants felt most comfortable with. Once the optimised&#xD;
      fitting of the devices was identified, the obtained parameters were stored, and the&#xD;
      configuration of the devices was left unchanged for reuse in the next session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the 2 remaining sessions, participants performed a series of 10 functional tasks. The&#xD;
      tasks were performed without assistance (NO-EXO condition) and with assistance (EXO&#xD;
      condition) of the exoskeletons. The tasks were performed first in the unpowered condition to&#xD;
      allow the participants to familiarise themselves with the tasks before performing them with&#xD;
      the assistance of the devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants were instructed to start every attempt at a task from a position marked on&#xD;
      the floor, and with their arms fully relaxed. This was to ensure that variability from&#xD;
      unknown factors was minimised. The participants then awaited the instruction from the&#xD;
      researchers to commence the task, given in the form of a spoken command triggered by the&#xD;
      press of a button. The button was pressed again to signal the end of the task, defined by the&#xD;
      following in order of priority: 1) participant decided to stop; 2) the participant dropped&#xD;
      the object; 3) therapist decided to stop after deciding the participant was experiencing&#xD;
      difficulties and further attempts would not contribute to a successful performance of the&#xD;
      task; 4) task is successfully completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the performance of functional tasks, the standing horizontal fingertip&#xD;
      reaching distance and the elbow ROM were measured using a measuring tape and a goniometer,&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the 3rd session, the participants were asked to fill up a questionnaire to&#xD;
      provide their subjective feedback regarding comfort, ergonomics, ease of use, overall&#xD;
      clinical benefit and user satisfaction.&#xD;
