  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bronchiectasis is a common disease worldwide with a high burden on healthcare resources. In&#xD;
      Hong Kong (HK), local microbiological and clinical data regarding acute exacerbation of&#xD;
      bronchiectasis (AEB) is lacking, in particular the frequency of pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA)&#xD;
      in AEB is yet to be elucidated. A better understanding of the microbiology of AEB will&#xD;
      provide evidence for judicious use of appropriate antibiotics in patients hospitalized for&#xD;
      AEB to facilitate treatment and discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. elucidate the microbiology of AEB using both traditional culture and newer molecular&#xD;
           multiplex methods,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. identify factors associated with PA infection, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. describe the management and treatment outcome of AEB in HK&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Bronchiectasis is a common disease worldwide with a high burden on healthcare resources. In&#xD;
      Hong Kong (HK), bronchiectasis ranked 5th highest as a cause of respiratory mortality, was&#xD;
      the 6th highest reason for respiratory inpatient bed-days and was the 7th highest cause of&#xD;
      respiratory hospitalization in Hong Kong in 2005.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local microbiological and clinical data regarding acute exacerbation of bronchiectasis (AEB)&#xD;
      is lacking, in particular the frequency of pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) in AEB is yet to be&#xD;
      elucidated. Traditional respiratory specimen takes time and lack sensitivity, a newer&#xD;
      multiplex molecular method may be beneficial in improving sensitivity and reducing turnover&#xD;
      time to detect pathogens involved in AEB. A better understanding of the microbiology of AEB&#xD;
      will provide evidence for judicious use of appropriate antibiotics in patients hospitalized&#xD;
      for AEB to facilitate treatment and discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients admitted to participating hospital with a clinical diagnosis of acute&#xD;
             exacerbation of bronchiectasis (AEB), defined as a change in bronchiectasis treatment&#xD;
             associated with deterioration in three or more of the following key symptoms for at&#xD;
             least 48 hours: cough; sputum volume and/or consistency; sputum purulence;&#xD;
             breathlessness and/or exercise tolerance; fatigue and/or malaise; or haemoptysis.&#xD;

             of bronchiectasis indicated by a bronchoarterial ratio of &gt; 1, lack of tapering,&#xD;
             airway visibility within 1 cm of the pleural surface, or a combination thereof.&#xD;
