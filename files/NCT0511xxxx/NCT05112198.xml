  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to (1) describe patient and clinician engagement in web-based&#xD;
      symptom self-monitoring, (2) identify differences in symptom management between intervention&#xD;
      and usual care groups, and (3) identify potential outcomes of real-time symptom tracking and&#xD;
      management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the assistance of the study coordinator, participants randomized to the intervention&#xD;
      will create an account with Noona. Patients will be instructed to log symptoms as often as&#xD;
      relevant using their own personal devices. Patients will also be prompted once per week for&#xD;
      24 weeks to log any recent symptoms. These participants will be sent a Symptom Questionnaire&#xD;
      (SQ) via the Noona tool that summarizes their symptoms and distress one week prior to each&#xD;
      oncology clinic visit. Symptoms designated as clinically severe either during regular symptom&#xD;
      logging or via the SQ will trigger a prompt to contact the clinical team for immediate&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      New patients from three cancer care programs (thoracic oncology, gastrointestinal oncology,&#xD;
      and palliative care) at two academic institutions (Stanford and UCSF) will be screened for&#xD;
      demographic and disease stage data within the patient medical record. Eligible patients will&#xD;
      be asked by their oncology team whether they would be interested in participating a study of&#xD;
      symptom management in oncology care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who express interest and ability to participate will be interviewed to determine&#xD;
      eligibility.&#xD;
