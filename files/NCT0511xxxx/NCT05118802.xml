    <textblock>
      This study identifies patient-important outcome measures and develops a survey that assesses&#xD;
      the impact of nutritional interventions among cancer patients. Currently, data on the impact&#xD;
      of medically tailored meals on outcomes that are meaningful to patients, providers, and&#xD;
      payers are limited. For this reason, access to medically tailored meals as a covered benefit&#xD;
      for cancer patients is limited. Thus, there is a need to explore the efficacy of nutritional&#xD;
      interventions among this population. This study identifies outcome measures for nutritional&#xD;
      interventions that are meaningful to patients and providers.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To identify patient-important outcomes related to receiving nutrition services by engaging&#xD;
      patients with cancer and clinicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To conduct cognitive interviews to assess comprehension, acceptability, and&#xD;
      appropriateness of patient-identified outcomes in aim 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To pilot test the use of the nutrition-related outcome measures identified in aim 1&#xD;
      among a sample of oncology patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part I: Patients and clinicians attend semi-structured interviews over 20-30 minutes or&#xD;
      cognitive interviews over 60 minutes in support of survey refinement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part II: Patients complete survey over 15 minutes.&#xD;
