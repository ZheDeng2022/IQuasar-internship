  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is known that the treatment of children with cancer has negative effects on cognition,&#xD;
      muscle strength, balance, and gait. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      effects of dual-task training, which is based on the principle of simultaneous performance of&#xD;
      cognitive tasks and motor tasks, on muscle strength, balance, and gait.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With the increase in the incidence of cancer, the number of children who survived cancer is&#xD;
      also increasing. Most studies on cancer survivors show that the disease and its treatment&#xD;
      have side effects and long-term late effects on the musculoskeletal system, physical&#xD;
      function, motor, and cognitive skills. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      effects of dual-task training, which is based on the principle of simultaneous performance of&#xD;
      cognitive tasks and motor tasks, on muscle strength, balance, and gait. This study is planned&#xD;
      to be the first study in which dual-task training is applied in children with cancer.&#xD;
