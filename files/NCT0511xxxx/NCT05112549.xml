      To determine the safety of intrathecal (IT) PD1 antibody for Intrathecal application of PD1&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Leptmeningeal disease (LMD) is an aggressive subtype of metastatic disease in the central&#xD;
      nervous system (CNS) and has a poor prognosis with a median overall survival of a few&#xD;
      months.The IT-PD1 trial group wants to contribute to an improvement of this situation for LMD&#xD;
      patients by using an intrathecal application route for the PD1 antibody, i.e. a drug that has&#xD;
      shown clinical efficacy in the underlying tumor via the intravenous route.&#xD;

For part I (3+3 Design) there will be four cohorts:&#xD;
Cohort 1 with a fix dose of 20 mg, Cohort 2 with a fix dose of 30 mg, Cohort 3 with a fix dose of 40 mg and Cohort 4 with a fix dose of 50 mg.&#xD;

    <description>This trial will investigate the maximum tolerable dose and safety of intrathecal PD1 antibody administration in LMD of metastatic solid tumors with a registered indication for treatment with intravenous PD1 antibody or PD-1L antibody. The safety endpoints will be assessed by a review of adverse events and serious adverse events according to CTCAE up to 4 months days after last dose.Subjects will undergo 6 cycles each 14 days in duration and a safety visit 7 days after the 3th dosage and 7 days after the 6th dosage.The appropriate dose for the expansion phase (Part II) is based on the results in Part I (dose escalation phase) and will define the maximum tolerable fix dose in Part II.</description>

    <description>This is a prospective, interventional, open label, multicenter phase I trail in leptomeningeal disease in subjects with solid tumors that have a registered indication for intravenous treatment with PD1 antibody. Subject will undergo 6 cycles each 14 days in duration and a safety visit 7 days after the 3th dosage and 7 days after the 6th dosage. The Follow-up phase will start four weeks after the last dose and will continue monthly (up to 4 Follow-up visits in total).The study consists of two parts:&#xD;
Part I &quot;dose - escalation phase&quot; (3 + 3 design) with 4 cohortsa and each subjects will receive an intrathecal nivolumab treatment with a fixed predefined dose (20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg or 50 mg). On each dose level, exposure of subjects to intrathecal nivolumab will follow a staggered approach. Part II &quot;dose expansion phase&quot;: subjects will receive an intrathecal PD1 treatment with a fixe dose, depending on the results from Part I.</description>

    <intervention_name>Nivolumab 10 MG/ML [Opdivo]</intervention_name>
    <description>Nivolumab 10 MG/ML (OPDIVO®) is a marketed pharmaceuticals material authorized in the European Union. This study uses an off-label route of administration of nivolumab. Subjects with leptomeningeal disease in solid tumours with an approved indication for intravenous treatment with the PD1 antibody will receive an intrathecal application of nivolumab. A total of six i.th. applications will be performed every 14 days. The intrathecal administration will be performed via an Ommaya reservoir or another intraventricular catheter.</description>
