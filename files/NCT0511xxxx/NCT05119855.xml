  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary hypothesis is that concomitant administration in adolescents of the first doses&#xD;
      of 9vHPV vaccine and mRNA-1273 vaccine induces noninferior geometric mean titers (GMTs) of&#xD;
      antibodies to each of the 9vHPV vaccine types 4 weeks postdose 2 of 9vHPV vaccine AND&#xD;
      noninferior geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-specific binding&#xD;
      antibody at 4 weeks Postdose 2 of mRNA-1273 vaccine, compared with the corresponding postdose&#xD;
      2 GMTs/GMCs induced by a 2-dose regimen of 9vHPV vaccine and mRNA-1273 vaccine, where the&#xD;
      first doses of each are administered nonconcomitantly.&#xD;
