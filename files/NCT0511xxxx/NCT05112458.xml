  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date, most caregiver focused interventions have been targeted at caregivers of adults with&#xD;
      cancer, completely ignoring the unique needs of caregivers of children with cancer. A recent&#xD;
      meta-analysis indicated that although these interventions had small to medium effects, they&#xD;
      significantly reduced burden, improved ability to cope, increased self-efficacy, and improved&#xD;
      aspects of caregivers' quality of life. Yet, several recent reviews highlighted a lack of&#xD;
      interventions to provide practical skills for the day-to-day provision of care. The&#xD;
      investigators have developed a pediatric oncology caregiver-focused intervention that seeks&#xD;
      to improve caregiver clinical skills/knowledge, self-efficacy, and support seeking skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cope 360 is a mHealth (mobile health) app designed to support caregivers of children with&#xD;
      cancer with symptom tracking, medication management, and emergency preparedness. The&#xD;
      investigators propose to evaluate Cope 360 via a pilot, randomized control trial in which&#xD;
      some caregivers will receive the app and some will not. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      assess: 1) feasibility of caregiver use over extended period of time, 2) acceptability of the&#xD;
      mHealth tool by caregivers in a real-world setting, 3) impact of the mHealth tool on&#xD;
      caregiver self-efficacy, mastery of caregiving skills/knowledge, and caregiver stress, and 4)&#xD;
      effect on healthcare utilization of the child with cancer (i.e. preliminary data about sick&#xD;
      visits and ED encounters).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Procedure: The investigators will identify approximately 164 primary caregivers of children&#xD;
      with cancer, 82 for both the intervention group and the usual care group. Those in the&#xD;
      intervention group will be presented with the mHealth app and with the help of the RA, the&#xD;
      participants will download the app onto their personal smartphone. Participants will be asked&#xD;
      to use the app for a 6-month period of time. They will also receive standardized education&#xD;
      that is provided to all caregivers of newly diagnosed patients at the investigator's&#xD;
      institution. Those in the usual care group will receive standardized education. These&#xD;
      caregivers will NOT be provided with access to the app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a participant has been enrolled in the study, the RA will collect demographic and&#xD;
      contact information and will administer baseline assessments. Follow-up surveys with a unique&#xD;
      identifier will be administered via email at 1, 3 and 6 months for caregivers in both the&#xD;
      intervention and control groups. If a survey is not completed, the RA will attempt to contact&#xD;
      the participant by phone. Surveys will be administered via Qualtrics. The investigators will&#xD;
      collect data via these surveys on participant demographics and mobile technology usage, and&#xD;
      outcomes will be measured utilizing the following assessments: the Caregiver Self-Efficacy&#xD;
      scale, Caregiver Mastery scale, Pediatric Inventory for Parents, and the Technology&#xD;
      Acceptance Model. Semi-structured interviews will be done with a subset of participants in&#xD;
      the intervention group at the 6-month mark. Intervention participants will be contacted by&#xD;
      phone or email and asked to participate in the interview until a subset of 30 is reached.&#xD;
      Interviews will be conducted in person, by phone, or by Zoom videoconferencing depending on&#xD;
      the clinic schedule of the participant's child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: Caregivers will be randomized into either the intervention group or the usual&#xD;
      care group. Randomization tables will be generated with SAS v9.4 using the RAND function&#xD;
      utilizing the Mersenne-Twister random number generator, using randomly permuted variable&#xD;
      block sizes of 2, 4, and 6. The randomization tables will be uploaded into RedCap's&#xD;
      randomization module. RAs will not be allowed access to these randomization tables to ensure&#xD;
      that the data collection remains unbiased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection and Analysis: Data will be collected on a variety of socio-demographic&#xD;
      factors that have been hypothesized to impact acceptability and use of technology: age,&#xD;
      education, gender, race, income, prior experience/exposure/awareness with computer or health&#xD;
      technology. Information gathered will also include basic information about their child's&#xD;
      cancer diagnosis including: type of cancer, date of diagnosis, and type of treatment&#xD;
      protocol. Semi-structured interviews will transcribed and analyzed using Nvivo qualitative&#xD;
      research software. Survey data will be analyzed with SAS v9.4, Qualtrics, and Microsoft&#xD;
      Excel.&#xD;
