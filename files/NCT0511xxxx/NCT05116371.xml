  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, researchers want to find out more about how the Etonogestrel (ENG)&#xD;
      contraceptive implant device (also known as Nexplanon) changes people's periods. Study&#xD;
      subjects will self select into an exposure group- starting combined hormonal contraceptive&#xD;
      pills (COC) on the same day as Nexplanon placement or a &quot;delayed initiation&quot; of COC when/if&#xD;
      bleeding concerns develop. Patients will be followed for 12 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted at University of Arizona. Investigators will recruit people&#xD;
      seeking Nexplanon placement and willing to enroll. We aim to enroll 144 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients ages 14-24 presenting for contraception services will be screened for potential&#xD;
      inclusion. A trained research assistant will conduct a brief patient-centered contraceptive&#xD;
      counseling session focusing on patient preferences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If interested in participating, the patient will be given a card to present to their&#xD;
      clinician. During the visit, patient and provider will discuss further method selection&#xD;
      including risks, benefits, and alternatives. The clinician will assess for contraindications&#xD;
      per the CDC MEC for use of COC or the implant. Screening for pregnancy, sexually transmitted&#xD;
      infections, and cervical cancer screening will follow as clinically indicated. If pregnancy&#xD;
      test is negative and clinician can be reasonably certain that patient is not pregnant using&#xD;
      the CDC Selected Practice Recommendations, the ENG implant will be placed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a clinician encounter, the research assistant will consent those interested in&#xD;
      participating. Patients will be assigned a unique identification number once they self-select&#xD;
      into their exposure group of choice:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. ENG implant with initiation of concurrent COC use for bleeding control at time of&#xD;
           insertion&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. ENG implant alone with option for &quot;delayed initiation&quot; of COC if bleeding concerns&#xD;
           develop&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled patients will complete Demographic Questionnaire and Bleeding Preference&#xD;
      Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled patients in exposure group 1 will receive 6 months COC pills (150 mcg&#xD;
      levonorgestrel/30 mcg ethinyl estradiol) and condoms for the first week of back-up method.&#xD;
      After 6 months, they will be offered a prescription to continue COC pills. Patients in&#xD;
      exposure group 2 will be receive handouts describing how to contact the research team should&#xD;
      bleeding concerns develop. A telehealth or in-person visit will be arranged with the research&#xD;
      clinicians, during which the patient may opt to start COC pills. A 6 month supply will be&#xD;
      provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up contact will be weekly for the first 6 months. There will also be 9 and 12 month&#xD;
      contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each contact will be a brief text-message survey inquiring about bleeding patterns, pill&#xD;
      usage and side effects. The ENG implant will be removed upon request at any time during the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participation will be completed after the 12 month follow-up survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No blood draws will occur during this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is little data available on the adverse effects of ENG implant use and combined COC.&#xD;
      This is a common clinical practice to combine use for bothersome bleeding and this study will&#xD;
      collect long-term data regarding this practice.&#xD;

        University of Arizona is a federally designated Hispanic Serving Institution with 28% of&#xD;
        its undergraduate population self-identifying as Hispanic. The Department of Obstetrics and&#xD;
        Gynecology provides a large proportion of contraceptive care in southern Arizona and is&#xD;
        situated to serve as an incubator for participatory research with our Latinx community.&#xD;
        From 7/1/2018 - 7/1/2019, a total of 340 patients had implants placed, with 50% of those&#xD;
        patients identifying as Latinx or Hispanic. Over a 24 months enrollment period, we estimate&#xD;
        that approximately 600 people will want an ENG implant, and through screening that 50% will&#xD;
        meet inclusion criteria (300), and 50% will consent to participate (150). Our target for&#xD;
        enrollment in 144 (72 non-Latinx and 72 Latinx).&#xD;
