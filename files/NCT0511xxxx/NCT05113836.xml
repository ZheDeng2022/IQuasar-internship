  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In late 2019, a new coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2&#xD;
      (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the cause of COVID-19 (COronaVIrus Disease-2019) in Hubei&#xD;
      Province, China. COVID-19 has become a pandemic with approximately 4.1 million confirmed&#xD;
      cases as of May 2020 resulting in 280,000 deaths worldwide. Between 5 and 20% of patients&#xD;
      hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection are admitted to the ICU with a mortality ranging from&#xD;
      25 to 60% depending on the series. At present, there is no effective targeted therapy against&#xD;
      this viral infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High-density lipoproteins (HDL) are nanoparticles made up of apolipoproteins, mainly apoA1,&#xD;
      associated with phospholipids whose main function is the reverse transport of cholesterol&#xD;
      from peripheral tissues to the liver. This property gives HDL a major cardiovascular&#xD;
      protective effect. In addition to this effect, studies have highlighted a number of&#xD;
      properties such as anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, anti-thrombotic and anti-oxidant&#xD;
      effects of these particles. Furthermore, it has been shown that HDL is able to bind and&#xD;
      neutralize bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS), promoting their elimination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During bacterial sepsis, a rapid decrease in plasma HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) concentration has&#xD;
      been demonstrated, but also an inverse correlation between mortality and HDL-C concentration.&#xD;
      In addition to the quantitative decrease in HDL during sepsis, dysfunctions of these&#xD;
      particles have been described, such as major differences in size, or a notable alteration in&#xD;
      protein composition with, in particular, more pro-inflammatory proteins. In this context of&#xD;
      both quantitative and qualitative alteration of HDL, authors have tested the efficacy of&#xD;
      injection of either reconstituted HDL (apoA1 + phosphatidylcholines) or peptides structurally&#xD;
      similar to ApoA1 in animal models of sepsis and have demonstrated a protective effect on&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality, with in particular a decrease in the inflammatory state induced by&#xD;
      sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low-density lipoproteins (LDL) can also neutralize LPS and observational studies have shown a&#xD;
      decrease in the concentration of LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) during sepsis. The authors also&#xD;
      showed that low LDL-C was associated with a poor prognosis in patients with sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During COVID-19-induced sepsis, a few studies have demonstrated a decrease in lipoprotein&#xD;
      (HDL and LDL) concentration. More specifically, some authors have found an association&#xD;
      between low lipoprotein concentrations and increased disease severity. To the best of the&#xD;
      knowledge of the investigators, no study has specifically investigated particulate&#xD;
      dysfunction of lipoproteins and in particular HDL during severe COVID-19 infections. On the&#xD;
      other hand, as it has been described that lipoproteins and particularly HDL can bind&#xD;
      bacterial components (LPS or LTA) favoring their clearance, it can be envisaged that these&#xD;
      particles can also bind SARS-CoV-2 components, and this, in a more or less strong way&#xD;
      depending on the virus strain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The preliminary results of the investigators show that in sepsis, serum amyloid A (SAA)&#xD;
      protein tends to replace apolipoprotein A1, making HDL dysfunctional. In addition,&#xD;
      paraoxonase-1, an antioxidant enzyme mainly carried by HDL, is almost absent or degraded in&#xD;
      septic patients. The SAA/PON-1 ratio could allow to assess the severity of COVID-19 damage&#xD;
      and to reinforce a possible therapeutic strategy based on the supplementation of severe&#xD;
      patients with apolipoprotein A1 and PON-1 rich HDL nanoparticles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective: To evaluate the functionality of HDL as a prognostic marker of mortality in&#xD;
      COVID-19 patients in ICU. To do so, a quantification of the SAA/PON-1 ratio at plasma level&#xD;
      and on isolated lipoproteins will be performed by ELISA.&#xD;
