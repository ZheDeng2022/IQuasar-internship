      Objective: This Phase II STTR grant incorporated user feedback collected in an earlier&#xD;
      development project to build interactive, web-based software that helps children with food&#xD;
      allergies learn about their condition and gain self-management skills. This highly&#xD;
      interactive game allows children to progress through virtual scenes to help them learn about&#xD;
      food avoidance, symptom detection, and reaction management. In addition, this project built&#xD;
      gaming complexity, with more levels and game options, of the two interactive games &quot;Label&#xD;
      Learning: Like it or Lose it!&quot; and &quot;Reaction Action!.&quot; Research Procedures: The researchers&#xD;
      elicited input from 8 families of children (ages 8-12) with food allergies and their parents&#xD;
      by presenting some of preliminary intervention materials (e.g., storyboards of a child in a&#xD;
      family gathering involving food) in a focus group format. After that, up to 40 families of&#xD;
      children with food allergies (ages 8-12) were recruited to participate in an &quot;open trial&quot;.&#xD;
      Families were asked to use the software for two weeks and provide feedback on the software.&#xD;
      Up to 100 families of children with food allergies (ages 8-12) were then recruited to&#xD;
      participate in a Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT) to assess the efficacy of the F3A-App vs.&#xD;
      Standard Care (brief office visit and educational handouts). Families in the clinical trial&#xD;
      were asked to use the software for two weeks and complete a standard care allergy office&#xD;
      visit. This design enabled the investigators to evaluate combined effects of Standard Care&#xD;
      and the F3A-App through typical treatment channels (e.g., is the greatest efficacy found&#xD;
      after a physician refers family to use the App after an office visit?). Gains in families'&#xD;
      knowledge and confidence in food allergy management were evaluated, and interviews with&#xD;
      families were conducted to gain further input regarding the software's credibility,&#xD;
      usability, and acceptability.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The central goal of this project was to develop an interactive, game-based application (App)&#xD;
      for school-aged children (aged 8-12) with food allergies (FA) that would increase knowledge,&#xD;
      improve behavioral skills for disease management, and ultimately reduce risk of negative&#xD;
      outcomes. An effective FA intervention for children should target content areas of food&#xD;
      avoidance and reaction management, and across these areas facilitate knowledge acquisition,&#xD;
      develop behavioral skills, and provide practice using these skills in social contexts. The&#xD;
      &quot;Friends, Family, and Food App (F3A-App)&quot;, consists of four related parts: (a) an&#xD;
      interactive, game-based application that is the core of the program, (b) the experiential&#xD;
      scenarios in interactive environments (e.g., school cafeteria vignette) that target knowledge&#xD;
      and behavioral skills practice in social contexts, (c) two engaging multi-level games to&#xD;
      build skills in food avoidance (Label Learning: Like it or Lose it!) and symptom assessment&#xD;
      (Reaction Action!), and (d) a multi-tiered reward system that uses token economy-based&#xD;
      reinforcement to enhance motivation and engagement (SeaLife Spectacular). From a user&#xD;
      perspective, the interactive, game-based application provides opportunities to practice&#xD;
      behavioral skills (e.g. negotiating pressures to accept trigger foods, requesting assistance&#xD;
      from adults, responding to teasing/bullying) in role-play situations with immediate feedback&#xD;
      and reinforcement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this Phase II project, the investigators proposed to produce a fully-developed version of&#xD;
      the F3A-App, including added content and enhanced features, and evaluate the final product in&#xD;
      a randomized clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of Phase II were:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To refine the F3A-App based on the user feedback and data collected in Phase I.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To develop and field test additional content, including two additional interactive&#xD;
           environments (family gathering, school pot-luck); and to increase gaming complexity&#xD;
           (i.e., more levels and options) in Label Learning: Like it or Lose it! and Reaction&#xD;
           Action! A small open trial was conducted, in which 40 children with FA, ages 8-12, used&#xD;
           selected segments containing the newly developed content. Children used the application&#xD;
           for 2 weeks on their home computer or tablet. Feedback about device preference and usage&#xD;
           was used to determine the focus of the Evaluation Stage (Aim 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the efficacy of the F3A-App vs. Standard Care (brief office visit and&#xD;
           educational handouts) in a randomized clinical trial with 100 children with FA, ages&#xD;
           8-12. The investigators expected the F3A-App would improve children's FA knowledge and&#xD;
           self-efficacy to manage FA (primary outcomes) and would increase parent-child&#xD;
           communication regarding FA management relative to Standard Care (secondary outcome). The&#xD;
           study's crossover design also made it possible to evaluate combined effects of Standard&#xD;
           Care and the F3A-App through typical treatment channels (e.g., is the greatest efficacy&#xD;
           found after a physician refers family to use the App after an office visit?) This Phase&#xD;
           II STTR targeted pediatric FA, a critical public health problem of increasing&#xD;
           prevalence. The approach was innovative by incorporating an emphasis on behavioral&#xD;
           skills practice using a platform that is engaging, interactive, affordable, and has high&#xD;
           potential for broad dissemination. The researchers envision that the F3A-App will&#xD;
           ultimately serve as a template for interactive, game-based applications for children&#xD;
           with other chronic conditions requiring self-management, such as asthma, diabetes, and&#xD;
           celiac disease.&#xD;

    <description>Semi-structured interview assessing various elements of food allergy (FA) management (caregiver and youth report). Domains of the scale are: FA knowledge, symptom assessment, family/child response to allergic reactions, family/child food avoidance, medication availability, alternate caregivers, parent/child anxiety related to FA, balanced integration of FA and family life. Higher scores on all scales indicate more optimal FA management. Klinnert, M.D., et al., Children's food allergies (FA): Development of the Food Allergy Management and Adaptation Scale (FAMAS).

    <description>The first portion of Arm A is a Standard Care (SC) office visit. Changes over time in Arm A represent a typical delivery channel in which a physician provides brief education and then encourages use of the F3A-App program. The SC intervention included a brief, structured office visit designed to replicate what would typically occur in a follow-up visit in an allergy clinic, and include provision standardized educational handouts available from the Food Allergy Research &amp; Education (FARE) website. The second phase of Arm A is use of the F3A-App.</description>

    <description>The first portion of Arm B is the use of the F3A-App for 2 weeks. Changes over time in Arm B represent an alternative delivery channel in which families use the F3A-App on their own and then have a follow-up office visit after using the self-guided program. The second phase of Arm B is the standard care office visit.&#xD;
