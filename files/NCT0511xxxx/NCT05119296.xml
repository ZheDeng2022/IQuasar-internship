             undifferentiated thyroid cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Disease characteristics one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;

             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg, thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc) is not considered a&#xD;
             form of systemic treatment and is allowed.&#xD;
