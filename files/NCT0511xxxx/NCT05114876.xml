  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive complications, that is problems with thinking and memory, are incredibly common&#xD;
      after surgery, occurring in 10-50% of all older surgical patients. These complications can&#xD;
      take different forms, but one of the most common is postoperative delirium (POD), a&#xD;
      short-term state of confusion. In addition to being stressful for patients and their&#xD;
      families, POD is linked to longer hospital stays, increased costs, higher mortality rates and&#xD;
      other problems after surgery. Despite this, POD is often not recognized by doctors and there&#xD;
      are currently no effective medications to treat POD. However, simple strategies such as&#xD;
      helping patients to sleep properly and remain hydrated, have been shown to help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is testing if a delirium-reduction program will reduce postoperative delirium&#xD;
      (POD) in older surgical patients. We will first test memory and thought processes before&#xD;
      surgery to find people who are most likely to develop POD. Once these people have been&#xD;
      identified, they will be enrolled in a program which includes recommendations for their care&#xD;
      team (e.g. surgeon, anesthesiologist, nurses) as well as educational materials for them and&#xD;
      their family related to things that can be done to prevent delirium. By identifying at-risk&#xD;
      patients and making sure that their doctors and caregivers are aware of how to prevent&#xD;
      delirium, we expect that this study will make surgery safer for older surgical patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Postoperative delirium (POD), an acute, reversible disturbance in brain function&#xD;
      characterized by fluctuating levels of consciousness, attention and cognition is a common&#xD;
      postoperative complication in older surgical patients. POD is associated with increased&#xD;
      morbidity, mortality, and risk of dementia; in addition to longer hospital stays and&#xD;
      increased healthcare costs. Despite this, POD frequently goes unrecognized by healthcare&#xD;
      providers and is often poorly proactively managed. There are currently no effective&#xD;
      pharmacological treatments for POD, although non-pharmacological prevention strategies (e.g.&#xD;
      promoting sleep hygiene, hydration, and early mobilization) have proven effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a two-phase, prospective, observational comparative study in patients (age ≥60)&#xD;
      presenting for major, elective surgical procedures with an expected postoperative stay ≥1&#xD;
      day(s). In both phases, baseline cognitive screening will be used to identify individuals&#xD;
      with evidence of pre-existing cognitive impairment (pre-CI), a key risk factor for POD, and&#xD;
      only individuals with pre-CI will be eligible to continue in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I will establish the prevalence of POD and pre-CI in our patient population at&#xD;
      Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, a tertiary care academic health sciences centre, and act&#xD;
      as a control group for Phase II. Phase II will evaluate the effects of a comprehensive&#xD;
      delirium-risk prevention bundle, which includes direct-to-patient education and healthcare&#xD;
      provider awareness strategies. Participants in both Phase I and Phase II will provide&#xD;
      written/verbal informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each phase we will complete delirium assessments for 130 patients at baseline and on&#xD;
      postoperative days 1-3. Demographic and clinical data will be abstracted from patient medical&#xD;
      records. PHQ-9 (depression) and AD-8 (dementia screening interview) questionnaires will be&#xD;
      completed at baseline.&#xD;

Direct-to-Patient Education Program&#xD;
Directly informing anesthesia and surgery teams about high-risk patients by flagging their chart, and providing suggestions for POD mitigation&#xD;
Flag charts as high risk for POD so that nursing staff in both the PACU and the wards are aware, facilitating implementation of CHASM interventions (i.e. evidence-based delirium prevention protocols).&#xD;
Reinforce CHASM best practices with regular educational sessions for nurses.</description>
