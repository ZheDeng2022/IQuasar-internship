  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma often die from intrahepatic disease because current&#xD;
      treatment options are limited. Local treatment using 166Ho-radioembolization (166Ho-RE)&#xD;
      offers a safe and effective treatment. Because 166Ho-microspheres are used as a scout dose&#xD;
      for treatment simulaton and for the actual treatment itself, a tailored approach can be used.&#xD;
      This concept has proven to be more predictive than the 90Y-radioembolization concept (current&#xD;
      standard-of-care), which is a based on a surrogate scout dose (i.e. 99mTc-MAA). A personal&#xD;
      treatment plan may be used for 166Ho-radioembolization to optimize efficacy, based on scout&#xD;
      dose distribution. However, individualized treatment planning inherently leads to treatment&#xD;
      doses that deviate from the currently approved 'one-size-fits-all' approach (i.e. 60 Gy&#xD;
      average absorbed dose for all patients). Therefore, safety of individualized 166Ho-RE will be&#xD;
      evaluated first to validate safety and confirm safety thresholds. These thresholds will be&#xD;
      used in subsequent randomized controlled studies.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The presented study proposal is a sequel study after a successful completion of the HEPAR&#xD;
      Primary study (all patients were treated, last follow-up visit planned for August 2020). In&#xD;
      the HEPAR Primary study, all treatments were planned using one compartment modeling, which&#xD;
      included the target volume without distinction between tumor and non-tumor compartments. Each&#xD;
      patient was treated with an average absorbed dose of 60 Gy in the target volume. In some&#xD;
      patients this treatment approach resulted in a high tumor and low normal liver absorbed dose,&#xD;
      in others this resulted in the opposite. No distinction was made because thresholds for a&#xD;
      safe normal liver and effective tumor absorbed dose were not known, since HEPAR Primary was&#xD;
      the first clinical study on 166Ho-RE in HCC. The study confirmed safety of a 60 Gy average&#xD;
      absorbed dose and gave insights in the previously unknown thresholds for a safe normal liver&#xD;
      and effective tumor absorbed dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis of the iHEPAR study is that dosimetry-based individualized treatment&#xD;
      planning is at least as safe as standard of care one compartment treatment planning, used in&#xD;
      HEPAR Primary, but with the potential of improved treatment outcomes. One compartment&#xD;
      modeling has the inherent risk of under- or over-dosing. Dosimetry-based individualized&#xD;
      treatment planning aims for an effective tumor absorbed dose, while keeping the non-tumor&#xD;
      absorbed dose within safety limits. So far, only one compartment modeling was established as&#xD;
      a safe and effective treatment approach in 166Ho-RE. This phase II study aims to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of dosimetry-based individualized 166Ho-RE in HCC. This data will be used&#xD;
      for the design of future randomized controlled trials.&#xD;
