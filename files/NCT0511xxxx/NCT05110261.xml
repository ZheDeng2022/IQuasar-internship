      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Nirsevimab, in Healthy&#xD;
      Preterm and Term Infants in China&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-dose study to&#xD;
      determine if nirsevimab will prevent medically attended RSV-confirmed LRTI in healthy preterm&#xD;
      and term infants entering their first RSV season. The population to be enrolled is healthy&#xD;
      preterm and term infants &gt; 29 weeks 0 days GA entering their first RSV season, who would not&#xD;
      receive RSV prophylaxis based on the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) or other local or&#xD;
      national guidelines. Approximately 800 subjects will be randomized 2:1 to receive a single IM&#xD;
      dose of nirsevimab 50 mg (if weight &lt; 5 kg) or 100 mg (if weight ≥ 5 kg) (N = 530) or placebo&#xD;
      (N = 270). Randomization will be stratified by subject age at the time of randomization (≤ 3&#xD;
      months, &gt; 3 to ≤ 6 months, &gt; 6 months), and by GA (&lt; 35 weeks GA, ≥ 35 weeks GA). Enrollment&#xD;
      of infants &gt; 6 months of age will be limited to approximately 100. All subjects will be&#xD;
      followed through 1 year after dose administration. An independent data monitoring committee&#xD;
      will review safety data regularly and make recommendations regarding further study conduct.&#xD;
      Around 40 investigational study centres participate in the study.&#xD;

    <description>The incidence of medically attended RSV LRTI (inpatient and outpatient) through 150 days post dose (ie, during a typical 5-month RSV season) for all infants, based on RSV test results (performed centrally using RT-PCR) and objective protocol-defined LRTI criteria, is the primary endpoint and will be presented by treatment groups. For subjects with multiple events, only the first occurrence will be used in the analysis. RSV LRTI that occurs through 150 days post dose will contribute to the primary efficacy analysis.</description>
