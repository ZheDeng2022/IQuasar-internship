  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies the effect of pembrolizumab and lenvatinib in treating&#xD;
      patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancers. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies&#xD;
      such as pembrolizumab may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere&#xD;
      with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Lenvatinib is an enzyme inhibitor that&#xD;
      may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;
      Giving pembrolizumab and lenvatinib may help to control the disease and provide an effective&#xD;
      therapeutic option for cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate both the individual and combined effects of pembrolizumab and lenvatinib on&#xD;
      T-cell dysfunction and proliferation in the peritoneal tumor microenvironment (p-TME) in&#xD;
      subjects with high-grade serous ovarian cancers with peritoneal metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the objective response rate to pembrolizumab and lenvatinib combination in&#xD;
      subjects with platinum-resistant high-grade serous ovarian cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate the individual and synergistic effects of pembrolizumab and lenvatinib on&#xD;
      T-cell effector function, improved T cell memory establishment, and myeloid subpopulations in&#xD;
      the p-TME.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To profile the dynamic changes in the immune phenotypes by dissecting the cell types and&#xD;
      functional states of various immune cell subsets in the sequential p-TME samples using single&#xD;
      cell ribonucleic acid sequencing (scRNAseq) and investigate changes in peritoneal immune&#xD;
      (T-cells, B cells, natural killer [NK] cells, dendritic cells, neutrophils, tumor-associated&#xD;
      macrophages [TAMs], myeloid-derived suppressor cells [MDSCs]) and non-immune cells&#xD;
      (fibroblasts, tumor cells) to identify cell subsets that are associated with immune&#xD;
      resistance and therapy response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To characterize T/B cell immune repertoire and their clonotypic phenotypes in a subset of&#xD;
      responders and non-responders using single cell T-cell receptor (TCR)/B-cell receptor (BCR)&#xD;
      sequencing (scTCR/BCRseq) simultaneously with scRNAseq.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT A: Beginning cycle 0, patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30&#xD;
      minutes on day 1. Beginning cycle 1, patients also receive lenvatinib orally (PO) once daily&#xD;
      (QD) on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 35 cycles in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT B: Beginning cycle 0, patients receive lenvatinib PO QD on days 1-21. Beginning cycle&#xD;
      1, patients also receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every&#xD;
      21 days for up to 35 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 30 days, every 6 weeks for 1&#xD;
      year, then every 9 weeks thereafter. Patients with confirmed disease progression are followed&#xD;
      every 12 weeks.&#xD;
