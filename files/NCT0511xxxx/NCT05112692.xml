  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common metabolic dysfunction and heterogeneous&#xD;
      endocrine disorder. It is the most common cause of anovulatory infertility, affecting&#xD;
      approximately 10%-18% of reproductive age women worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is usually characterized by a clustering of hyperandrogenism, hypersecretion of&#xD;
      luteinizing hormone (LH) and hyperinsulinaemia, which could result in the arrest of ovarian&#xD;
      follicular growth, oligo-ovulation or anovulation, menstrual dysfunction, hirsutism,&#xD;
      infertility, pregnancy and/or neonatal complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women with PCOS undergoing IVF or Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) treatment because&#xD;
      of infertility are increasing in number, and these patients have been well described,&#xD;
      typically characterized by producing an increased number of oocytes but are often of poor&#xD;
      quality leading to lower fertilization, implantation, and pregnancy rates and a higher&#xD;
      miscarriage rate and incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increasing evidence raises the issue that impaired oocyte maturation and developmental&#xD;
      competence in women with PCOS are possibly linked to abnormal endocrine/ paracrine factors,&#xD;
      metabolic dysfunction and alterations in the intrafollicular microenvironment during&#xD;
      folliculogenesis and follicle maturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several clinical ovarian stimulation protocols have been used so far in women with PCOS&#xD;
      undergoing IVF treatment to prevent a premature LH surge during controlled ovarian&#xD;
      stimulation (COS); these primarily include gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or&#xD;
      antagonist protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GnRH antagonists can competitively inhibit endogenous GnRH and produce an immediate and rapid&#xD;
      decline in LH and Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels without the flare effect of a&#xD;
      GnRH agonist, and their administration by subcutaneous injection in the late follicular phase&#xD;
      prevents an LH surge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With progress in embryo vitrification techniques, many studies have suggested that&#xD;
      pregnancies that arise from the transfer of frozen-thawed IVF embryos appear to have better&#xD;
      perinatal and pregnancy outcomes. Thus, GnRH antagonist regimens combined with a freeze-all&#xD;
      strategy for women with PCOS are currently accepted as the most routine IVF procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The progesterone's pituitary suppression was recently used in controlled ovarian stimulation&#xD;
      and approved its efficacy in terms of low incidence of premature LH surge and comparable&#xD;
      pregnancy outcomes to short protocols in infertile women of normal ovarian reserve and&#xD;
      polycystic ovarian syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These data indicated that progestin treatment might improve oocyte quality compared with a&#xD;
      GnRH antagonist during COS in these patients, plus there were the advantages of an oral&#xD;
      administration route instead of repeated injections of GnRH antagonist, a lower drug price&#xD;
      and more control over LH levels, which can reduce the patients' discomfort and costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, to avoid a low response of the hypothalamic pituitary ovarian axis, a double&#xD;
      trigger with GnRHa and a low dose of Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)(1000IU) was used to&#xD;
      induce final oocyte maturation without increasing the risk of moderate or severe Ovarian&#xD;
      hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Choosing the appropriate progestin is crucial to the success of the Progestin-primed ovarian&#xD;
      stimulation protocol (PPOS). Previous studies have shown that both Medroxyprogesterone&#xD;
      acetate (MPA) and Utrogestan are effective oral alternatives for the PPOS protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MPA is preferred over Utrogestan because the administration of a natural exogenous&#xD;
      progesterone, such as Utrogestan, can interfere with serum progesterone measurement and lead&#xD;
      to the neglect of possible premature luteinization. However, the use of MPA during ovarian&#xD;
      stimulation may lead to stronger pituitary suppression and thus may require a higher dosage&#xD;
      of gonadotrophin and a longer ovarian stimulation duration than that of the conventional&#xD;
      ovarian stimulation protocol. Therefore, the investigators need to test more synthetic&#xD;
      progestins to find the most suitable option for PPOS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dydrogesterone (DYG), which has a molecular structure similar to that of natural&#xD;
      progesterone, is widely used for hormone replacement therapy, endometriosis treatment,&#xD;
      menstrual disorders and luteal support in pregnancy and threatened miscarriage. However,&#xD;
      unlike MPA, the use of DYG under the recommended dosage (10-20 mg) does not inhibit&#xD;
      ovulation, and thus, the use of DYG as an alternative to MPA and as an appropriate progestin&#xD;
      in the PPOS regimen has yet to be explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators hypothesize that DYG can be used as an alternative progestin&#xD;
      in the PPOS protocol. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) is designed to investigate cycle&#xD;
      characteristics and endocrinological profiles of patients taking gonadotrophin while using&#xD;
      DYG co-treatment, and to compare pregnancy outcomes in first frozen embryo transfer (FET)&#xD;
      cycles with GNRH antagonist protocol as a control.&#xD;
