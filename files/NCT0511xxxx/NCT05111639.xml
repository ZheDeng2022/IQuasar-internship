  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposal will aim to improve the understanding about the treatment decision in the type&#xD;
      of urinary diversion and identify patient knowledge gaps about uncertainty around patient&#xD;
      decision-making.&#xD;

      The Investigator aims to elicit the patient and provider experiences through conducting a&#xD;
      90-minute interview, using an interview guide the research team has developed, using&#xD;
      established qualitative research methods for in-depth individual interviews. The team will&#xD;
      structure the interviews with broad, open-ended questions to elicit personal thoughts,&#xD;
      emotions and experiences regarding decision making for urinary diversion. The team will use&#xD;
      the information collected from this interview to make a tool valuable in developing a patient&#xD;
      decision aid. For patients who have not undergone surgery yet, the team will ask the patient&#xD;
      if it is okay to contact after their surgery to reassess the patients responses to the same&#xD;
      questions from the first interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Aim 2, the team will complete part one of the Ottawa decision framework by assessing the&#xD;
      patients' and urologists' determinates of decisions for urinary diversion and identify&#xD;
      support needs. Using established qualitative research methods for in-depth individual&#xD;
      interviews, the team will structure the interviews with broad, open-ended questions to elicit&#xD;
      personal thoughts, emotions and experiences regarding decision making for urinary diversion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed by Aim 2 the team will develop a web-based development of a decision aid. The&#xD;
      development process will use both the Ottawa decision support and IPDAS to center the design&#xD;
      empathetic to the user. The aim will be consistent with principles where the users take&#xD;
      priority in the IPDAS guidelines framework and the needs assessment framework. The team will&#xD;
      develop a decision support tailored to patients needs who are undergoing urinary diversion&#xD;
      and then evaluate the decision making process. The decision aid will use the preferences from&#xD;
      the themes of the individual interviews to give patients a preferred method of urinary&#xD;
      diversion. The team will perform this in a pre-post fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As mentioned previously, patients will be recruited from the urologists' clinical work. The&#xD;
      Indiana and Neobladder patients may have different vantage points in the perioperative&#xD;
      period, however at 6-months this should no longer be different. In addition, the team will&#xD;
      have patients use the decision aid at 1-month postoperatively to obtain feedback. Getting&#xD;
      patient feedback from the group will be critical with such a large number of patients&#xD;
      recruited. The research assistant will identify eligible patients prior to their clinic&#xD;
      encounter and obtain informed consent. Patients will then complete the decision aid prior to&#xD;
      the visit with the surgeon and bring the completed tool into the clinical encounter. After&#xD;
      completing the visit, the patient and research assistant will complete the questionnaires&#xD;
      assessing acceptability, knowledge, treatment decision and decisional conflict. One month&#xD;
      after surgery, our team will also complete the same questionnaires, as well as patient&#xD;
      satisfaction and regret at the 6-month follow-up visit. If patients are not available for the&#xD;
      visit, our team will attempt to complete telehealth or telephone interviews.&#xD;
