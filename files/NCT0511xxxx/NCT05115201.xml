    <textblock>
      Evidence support that pathogenic bacteria are not only responsible for periodontal&#xD;
      destruction but also contributes to systemic inflammatory burden either directly or&#xD;
      indirectly through increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines. Scaling and root planing (SRP)&#xD;
      with or without local antibiotics contributes to reduced systemic inflammation. However,&#xD;
      studies also reported insignificant changes in systemic inflammation after SRP. It may be due&#xD;
      to incomplete control of periodontal inflammation. Systemic antibiotics proves to beneficial&#xD;
      in treatment of severe periodontitis. Systemic antibiotics along with SRP results in&#xD;
      improvement of vascular health and systemic inflammation. However, till date no study has&#xD;
      been done to evaluate the role of systemic antibiotics as an adjunct to SRP on systemic&#xD;
      inflammatory markers. In this randomized control study impact of adjunctive use of systemic&#xD;
      antibiotics along with SRP on systemic inflammation would be assessed in periodontitis&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Periodontitis is characterized by microbially-associated, host-mediated inflammation that&#xD;
      results in loss of periodontal attachment. Periodontal bacteria possess a plethora of&#xD;
      virulence factors that induce cells to produce inflammatory mediators at the gingival level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periodontitis is associated with bacteraemia that arises from perturbation of ulcerated&#xD;
      periodontal tissues by simple acts of tooth brushing, eating and also during periodontal&#xD;
      interventions disseminating whole bacteria and their products and toxins such as LPS.&#xD;
      Virulence factors and bacteria itself interact with the host immune system and initiate&#xD;
      inflammatory responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, bacteria may persist at distal sites disseminating virulence factors that act as&#xD;
      soluble antigens thereby provocation leucocytes, endothelial cells and hepatocytes to respond&#xD;
      to bacteria/virulence factors with secretion of pro-inflammatory immune mediators [cytokines,&#xD;
      chemokines, C-reactive protein (CRP)]. With continued exposure, soluble antigens react with&#xD;
      circulating specific antibody to form immune complexes that further amplify inflammation at&#xD;
      sites of deposition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In industrialized countries, approximately 50% of the adult population suffers from moderate&#xD;
      or severe periodontitis. Basic periodontal therapy usually comprises mechanical debridement&#xD;
      of the teeth. It is the disruption of biofilm, followed by lifelong maintenance therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditional periodontal therapy involves elimination of periodontopathogens by mechanical&#xD;
      debridement, such as scaling and root planing (SRP) and surgical procedures in conjunction&#xD;
      with proper plaque control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the infective nature of periodontitis, pharmacologic agents have been advocated as&#xD;
      adjuncts in the non-surgical treatment of periodontal infection. The rationale for the&#xD;
      adjunctive use of antibiotics is to exert an antimicrobial effect at sites inaccessible to&#xD;
      mechanical therapy, and possibly to suppress periodontal pathogens. Moreover, absence of&#xD;
      specific periodontal pathogens seems to have a negative predictive value for further&#xD;
      attachment loss. Therefore, one objective of periodontal treatment might be to suppress or&#xD;
      eliminate certain subgingival periodontal pathogens. Adjunctive antibiotics have been&#xD;
      suggested to improve treatment outcomes in patients with severe chronic periodontitis and&#xD;
      aggressive periodontitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of amoxicillin and metronidazole's proven ability to suppress periodontal pathogens,&#xD;
      such as A. actinomycetemcomitans and black pigmented bacteria from periodontitis lesions and&#xD;
      other oral sites, it is the first choice of many clinicians, especially for the treatment of&#xD;
      advanced A. actinomycetemcomitans-associated periodontitis. These pathogenic bacteria are not&#xD;
      only restricted to oral cavity, but are associated with disease implication in other parts of&#xD;
      the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence support that pathogenic bacteria are not only responsible for periodontal&#xD;
      destruction but also contributes to systemic inflammatory burden either directly or&#xD;
      indirectly through increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines. Scaling and root planing with or&#xD;
      without local antibiotics contributes to reduced systemic inflammation. However, studies also&#xD;
      reported insignificant changes in systemic inflammation after SRP. It may be due to&#xD;
      incomplete control of periodontal inflammation. Systemic antibiotics proves to beneficial in&#xD;
      treatment of severe periodontitis. Systemic antibiotics along with scaling and root planing&#xD;
      results in improvement of vascular health and systemic inflammation. However, till date no&#xD;
      study has been done to evaluate the role of systemic antibiotics as an adjunct to scaling and&#xD;
      root planing on systemic inflammatory markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this randomized controlled clinical trial, impact of adjunctive use of systemic&#xD;
      antibiotics along with scaling and root planing on systemic inflammation would be assessed in&#xD;
      periodontitis patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present randomized clinical trial will be conducted in Department of Periodontics and&#xD;
      Oral Implantology, Post Graduate Institute of Dental Sciences, Rohtak. The study protocol is&#xD;
      according to the ethical standards of Helsinki Declaration 1975 as revised in 2013.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periodontally healthy individuals (PH) and stage III periodontitis patients of age 35-45&#xD;
      years will be recruited from outpatient department of Periodontics and Oral Implantology. The&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled after obtaining an informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental design: This randomized clinical trial consists of two parallel groups based&#xD;
      intervention in periodontitis patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periodontal parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline, periodontal parameters plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), bleeding on&#xD;
      probing (BOP), probing pocket depth (PPD), clinical attachment loss (CAL) will be assessed at&#xD;
      six sites (disto-buccal, mid-buccal, mesio-buccal, mesio-lingual, mid-lingual and&#xD;
      disto-lingual) per tooth excluding third molars in all groups. Periodontal inflamed surface&#xD;
      area (PISA) will then be calculated. Periodontal examination would again be done during&#xD;
      recall visit after 2nd month in test group (TG) and control group (CG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periodontal therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After recording periodontal parameters at baseline, oral hygiene instructions would be given&#xD;
      and scaling and root planing (SRP) would be done in both treatment groups (TG and CG). TG&#xD;
      will be given amoxicillin and metronidazole, 500mg and 400mg respectively (AMX+MTZ) to be&#xD;
      taken thrice daily for 7 days. Patients will inform about any self-perceived side-effects of&#xD;
      the medications. Any adverse effects from antibiotic intake and compliance, as reported by&#xD;
      patients, will be recorded throughout the study period. TG and CG would be recalled after&#xD;
      1stand 2nd month of SRP. At recall visit after 1 month, oral hygiene instructions will be&#xD;
      re-enforced and supportive periodontal therapy would be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood collection and serum analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For assessing markers of systemic inflammation, serum samples will be collected from&#xD;
      venipuncture in antecubital fossa after an overnight fasting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum samples would be analyzed for systemic markers at baseline and after 2 months of&#xD;
      periodontal treatment in TG and CG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parameter of systemic inflammation that would be assessed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ High sensitive C-reactive protein (hs CRP)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood parameters that would be assessed: Total leukocyte count(TLC), differential leukocyte&#xD;
      count (DLC), neutrophil lymphocyte ratio, platelet count, mean platelet volume (MPV),&#xD;
      platelet distribution width (PDW), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), red blood cell count&#xD;
      (RBC), hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Hct), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular&#xD;
      hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), red cell distribution&#xD;
      width (RDW)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood parameters that would be assessed: triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC),&#xD;
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), very&#xD;
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric parameter that would be measured: Body Mass Index (BMI) calculated as&#xD;
      weight/height2 (Kg/m2) at baseline.&#xD;
