  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diagnostic and therapeutic progress of the last twenty years has been accompanied by an&#xD;
      evolution in the morbidity and mortality of intensive care unit (ICU) patients. While there&#xD;
      has been an overall decrease in mortality in the ICU, nearly 20% of patients die within one&#xD;
      year after ICU discharge and survivors are marked by an increase in morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indeed, independently of the initial disease, it is currently recognized that an admission to&#xD;
      the ICU can be experienced as a traumatic situation, with potential physical, psychological&#xD;
      and cognitive impairments that can be described by the term &quot;post-intensive care syndrome&quot;&#xD;
      (PICS). This results in a decrease in quality of life compared to the general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health-related quality of life (HRQoL)has received increasing attention in the literature.&#xD;
      Thus, many studies have been interested in its evaluation, in particular in certain&#xD;
      pathologies such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, cardiac arrest or in&#xD;
      patients with onco-hematological diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paradoxically, few studies have described the HRQoL and the elements of the PICS in the&#xD;
      overall population of patients admitted to the ICU. However, a better understanding of these&#xD;
      elements could allow us to propose improvement strategies to facilitate the rehabilitation of&#xD;
      these patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators therefore propose the constitution of a longitudinal cohort evaluating the&#xD;
      HRQoL, and allowing the analysis of its determinants in the global population of intensive&#xD;
      care patients.&#xD;
