  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Failures in non-technical skills (NTS) contribute to adverse events in healthcare. Previous&#xD;
      research has explored the assessment and training of these skills, and yet there is a lack of&#xD;
      evidence for their impact on clinical outcomes. Gastrointestinal endoscopy is a high-pressure&#xD;
      specialty, but to date there is little on the role of NTS in this area, or a method for their&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This MD project aims to measure NTS in endoscopy, explore their relationship with clinical&#xD;
      outcomes, and identify those specific to this area of healthcare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods An observational study of endoscopy teams in real time, using the Oxford NOTECHS II&#xD;
      assessment tool. Comparison of NTS performance with procedure outcomes and patient&#xD;
      satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A qualitative interview study with staff members to establish the NTS specifically relevant&#xD;
      to working in gastrointestinal endoscopy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Ten to fifteen percent of patients will experience some kind of adverse event during their&#xD;
      hospital stay. A significant proportion of these occur in surgery. The causes of such adverse&#xD;
      events often stem not from deficiencies in clinical or technical skills but from the&#xD;
      non-technical aspects of human and team performance).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Much of the early research in this field comes from the aviation industry where&#xD;
      &quot;non-technical skills&quot; are defined as &quot;the cognitive and social skills of flight crew members&#xD;
      in the cockpit&quot;. Failures in teamwork in cockpit crews have been linked to half of adverse&#xD;
      events in aviation and further work within surgery has shown a significant reduction in&#xD;
      adverse events when teams perform well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Behavioural ratings systems have been used in aviation and other high risk industries for&#xD;
      many years to facilitate assessment and training. &quot;NOTECHS&quot; was designed in the 1990s by a&#xD;
      collaboration of European aviation experts as a system to assess the non-technical skills of&#xD;
      individual pilots. Over recent years similar such tools or taxonomies have been developed in&#xD;
      healthcare. Within surgery some taxonomies assess individual team members such as&#xD;
      'Non-Technical Skills for Surgeons' (NOTSS), 'Anaesthetists' Non-Technical Skills' (ANTS) and&#xD;
      'Scrub Practitioners List of Intra-operative Non-Technical Skills' (SPLINTS), whilst others&#xD;
      aim to assess the whole team: 'revised NOTECHS', 'Oxford NOTECHS (II)' and 'Observational&#xD;
      Teamwork Assessment for Surgery' (OTAS). 'NOTSS', 'ANTS' and 'SPLINTS' were developed by a&#xD;
      group at the University of Aberdeen. Each provides a rating scale to assess the non-technical&#xD;
      skills of an individual practitioner within a surgical team. They can be used as an&#xD;
      observational assessment or a self-evaluation tool for reflection and professional&#xD;
      development. The &quot;revised NOTECHS&quot; scale developed by a team at Imperial College, adapted the&#xD;
      &quot;NOTECHS&quot; system to assess the non-technical skills of theatre teams. The &quot;Oxford NOTECHS&quot;&#xD;
      was similarly adapted from &quot;NOTECHS&quot; to assess theatre teams but with an additional&#xD;
      subdivision into three &quot;sub-teams&quot; (surgical, anaesthetic and nursing). The &quot;Oxford NOTECHS&quot;&#xD;
      has further been revised to the &quot;Oxford NOTECHS II&quot; scale to improve the discrimination&#xD;
      between levels of performance. &quot;OTAS&quot; combines a task checklist and a team behaviour&#xD;
      assessment in the pre- operative, operative and post-operative phases of a procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two studies using the Oxford NOTECHS system have shown an improvement in scores after a&#xD;
      training intervention. Mishra et al observed 65 laparoscopic cholecystectomies before and&#xD;
      after a Crew Resource Management (CRM) style training intervention applied to all staff&#xD;
      members (29 laparoscopic cholecystectomies before, 39 after). Oxford NOTECHS scores improved&#xD;
      significantly after the training intervention. Scores negatively correlated with technical&#xD;
      error rates and positively (but not significantly) with staff safety attitudes. Another study&#xD;
      observing laparoscopic cholecystectomy and carotid endarterectomy showed similar improvement&#xD;
      in Oxford NOTECHS scores after a training intervention (all staff trained). This was&#xD;
      associated with a concurrent decrease in technical errors, procedural errors and an increase&#xD;
      in Safety Attitude Questionnaire scores, but no significant change in clinical outcomes.&#xD;
      These findings are consistent with a number of other studies investigating the effect of&#xD;
      human factors team training within healthcare. Outcome measures vary between studies:&#xD;
      learning assessment questionnaires, observed teamwork behaviour, participant perception of&#xD;
      teamwork and staff attitudes have all been used as markers of performance and have all shown&#xD;
      to improve after team training interventions. Unfortunately only a few studies have linked&#xD;
      training interventions to clinical outcome improvements. The Veterans Health Administration&#xD;
      Medical Team Training (MTT) program was a multi-center quality improvement program in the&#xD;
      USA. This study showed a significant reduction in surgical morbidity after the introduction&#xD;
      of team training. This along with the Oxford NOTECHS studies demonstrates that improving&#xD;
      non-technical skills may improve clinical outcomes. Thus though there is a range of data on&#xD;
      the effect of training on reduction of non-technical error, and some data which demonstrates&#xD;
      a direct link between non-technical skills and successful outcomes, there is still much work&#xD;
      to be done in clarifying the three-way links between non-technical skills, successful&#xD;
      outcomes and the role of training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopy units are akin to day-case theatre complexes. Endoscopic procedures vary in their&#xD;
      length and complexity. Diagnostic gastroscopy and colonoscopy with or without biopsy (removal&#xD;
      of tissue) are the commonest procedures performed. However, there are a wide range of&#xD;
      therapeutic procedures also undertaken including stenting, endoscopic resection of tumours,&#xD;
      endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography and feeding gastrostomy insertion. Patients&#xD;
      consent to undergo these procedures having been fully informed of the risks involved. They&#xD;
      are either awake, under sedation (56.4% of sedation in the Peninsula region occurs in&#xD;
      Endoscopy units), or under general anaesthetic depending on the complexity of the procedure&#xD;
      and their preference. The PHNT endoscopy unit performs more than 12,000 procedures per year&#xD;
      in a contained unit of 5 rooms, operating Monday to Saturday. Additional procedures requiring&#xD;
      x-ray screening occur within the radiology department supplemented by Endoscopists and&#xD;
      Nursing staff from the unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are clear auditable outcome standards for technical performance and training in&#xD;
      Endoscopy provided by the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) and the Joint Advisory&#xD;
      Group on GI Endoscopy (JAG). These include markers of completion of procedures such as Caecal&#xD;
      Intubation Rate and Adenoma Detection Rate in Colonoscopy. Challand et al showed that good&#xD;
      clinical performance in Colonoscopy was associated with increased efficiency. They also found&#xD;
      that there was no negative effect of training on either of these outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although adverse events are rare in Endoscopy, advances in technology and techniques have led&#xD;
      to an increase in risk. As therapeutic procedures become more advanced the more &quot;surgical&quot;&#xD;
      the specialty becomes. The National Confidential Enquiry into patient Outcomes and Death&#xD;
      Report 2004 investigated the death of 1818 patients within 30 days of therapeutic endoscopy&#xD;
      during April 2002 to March 2003. They found a wide variety of practice in different units&#xD;
      across the UK, particularly in areas such as sedation administration, patient monitoring and&#xD;
      planning of procedures: the non-technical aspects of endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Endoscopist, whether a Surgeon, Physician or Advanced Nurse Practitioner, is equivalent&#xD;
      to the operating surgeon and nursing staff perform very similar roles to theatre&#xD;
      nurses/practitioners. An anaesthetist is present only for those procedures performed under&#xD;
      general anaesthetic. Despite a similar team and technical set up to an operation room there&#xD;
      is a clear deficit in the literature with regards to non-technical skills and team&#xD;
      performance within Endoscopy. It is likely that there will be a three-way relationship&#xD;
      between non-technical skills, successful outcomes and training as there are for other&#xD;
      surgical areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopy units share many characteristics with theatre complexes and are pioneering&#xD;
      increasingly complex procedures and yet there is little literature relating to the assessment&#xD;
      or training of team performance in this area; even within other areas of healthcare there is&#xD;
      little correlation with clinical outcomes. Taxonomies for team performance and non-technical&#xD;
      skills assessment in surgery are now well established and yet there still is no published&#xD;
      evidence of their use in or adaptation for Endoscopy. There is therefore scope for:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The evaluation and development of a non-technical skills assessment tool within&#xD;
           Endoscopy (based on Oxford NOTECHS II - a well-established taxonomy with good&#xD;
           reliability and validity). Correlation of non-technical skills with clinical and other&#xD;
           outcomes. Our endoscopy unit has a large throughput of similar cases per annum&#xD;
           (&gt;12,000). This means the face, construct and concurrent validity of the non-technical&#xD;
           skills assessment tool can be tested reliably with greater power. Scores could be&#xD;
           correlated easily with standardized quality and safety outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Development of a Human Factors Simulation team training intervention based on the&#xD;
           knowledge gained from. Training has yet to take place within the Endoscopy unit in our&#xD;
           Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of the project are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To develop the measurement of non-technical skills in endoscopy (using the Oxford NOTECHS II&#xD;
      taxonomy); to delineate the relationship between successful clinical (and other) outcomes and&#xD;
      non-technical skills as measured by the tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopy units share many characteristics with theatre complexes and are pioneering&#xD;
      increasingly complex procedures and yet there is little literature relating to the assessment&#xD;
      or training of team performance in this area; even within other areas of healthcare there is&#xD;
      little correlation with clinical outcomes. Taxonomies for team performance and non-technical&#xD;
      skills assessment in surgery are now well established and yet there still is little evidence&#xD;
      of their use in or adaptation for Endoscopy. This project seeks to provide a firm basis for&#xD;
      future work by establishing the measurement of non-technical skills in endoscopy, relating&#xD;
      those skills to clinical outcomes, and identifying those features of non-technical skills&#xD;
      training likely to be of greatest importance in terms of successful clinical outcomes.&#xD;
