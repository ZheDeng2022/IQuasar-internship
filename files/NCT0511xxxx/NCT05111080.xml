    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common carcinoma detected in women, accounting for about one fifth&#xD;
      of new cancer cases in females. In Egypt breast cancer is the most common malignancy in&#xD;
      women, accounting for 38,8% of cancers in this population, with the estimated number of&#xD;
      breast cancer cases nearly 22700 in 2020 and forecasted to be approximately 46000 in 2050.&#xD;
      Surgical removal of the cancer represents the standard of care followed by radiation and&#xD;
      adjuvant therapy in patients considered to be at particular risk for systemic disease.&#xD;
      Estimation of prognosis is of vital importance for tailoring adjuvant therapy in individual&#xD;
      breast cancer patients. Conventional pathological parameters such as histological grade,&#xD;
      tumor size and presence of lymph node metastasis are not accurate enough to select subsets of&#xD;
      patients who are at sufficiently low risk of progression to be spared extensive adjuvant&#xD;
      therapy without compromising the prognosis. Much hope is placed on cytogenetic features&#xD;
      analysis which might help to improve prediction of patient prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a molecular cytogenetic technique that enables&#xD;
      the detection of genetic abnormalities such as gene amplification, deletions, and chromosomal&#xD;
      rearrangements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deletions of chromosome 10q23 including the PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) locus are&#xD;
      known to occur in breast cancer patients. The PTEN gene is a phosphatase which metabolises&#xD;
      PIP3, the lipid product of PI 3-kinase, directly opposing the activation of the oncogenic&#xD;
      PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling network. Inactivation of PTEN leads to constitutively activated&#xD;
      levels of AKT, thus promoting cell growth, proliferation, survival and migration through&#xD;
      multiple downstream effectors. PTEN is one of the most frequently deleted genes in various&#xD;
      human cancer types. In breast cancer, the frequency of PTEN deletions or reduced expression&#xD;
      varies from 4 % to 63 %.&#xD;
