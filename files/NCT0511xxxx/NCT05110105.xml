      The purpose of this study is to explore the effectiveness between interactive board game&#xD;
      health education and conventional health education in improving community-dwelling adults'&#xD;
      stroke knowledge and self-reported stroke health literacy, including risk factors, symptoms,&#xD;
      acute management of stroke, and 6 aspects of self-reported stroke health literacy. The&#xD;
      intervention group will receive an interactive board game in a group (2~6 individuals), while&#xD;
      the control group was assigned to read the health education flier and watching the stroke&#xD;
      prevention video. The follow-up period was set to be four weeks after the intervention, both&#xD;
      control group, and intervention group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is a major health problem and a known cause of death and disability. Approximately 13&#xD;
      million people suffered from stroke worldwide annually and it ranks fourth among the top 10&#xD;
      causes of death in Taiwan. In a recent survey of Taiwanese citizens on the World Stroke Day&#xD;
      event (New Taipei City) in 2012, the public's stroke literacy was low, only 5.71% of them can&#xD;
      reach &quot;good stroke literacy&quot;. Generally, stroke education was mostly implemented in a one-way&#xD;
      lecture way. Therefore, instead of one-way style health education, the investigators assume&#xD;
      that interactive board games can increase stroke knowledge, stroke literacy, and&#xD;
      self-reported stroke health literacy of community-dwelling seniors.&#xD;

    <description>Participants' stroke knowledge and literacy were assessed by a questionnaire. Good stroke literacy was determined according to fulfillment of the following criteria: (1) the brain was recognized as the main damaged organ; (2) at least five risk factors of stroke were identified; (3) more than five stroke symptoms were identified; and (4) in case of a stroke, the identified appropriate response was to call 119 immediately. For risk factors and symptoms, according to each correct answer given, a score of either 0 or 1 is given, 1 being the right answer given. A higher score would indicate a better knowledge of the risk factors and symptoms of stroke.</description>

    <time_frame>Right after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Participants' self-reported stroke health literacy was assessed by a questionnaire. The questionnaire contains 6 aspects of stroke health literacy, including the ability to (1) obtain stroke health information; (2) understand written stroke health information; (3) understand oral stroke health information, (4) communicate and being interactive with stroke health information; (5) evaluate and judge stroke health information; (6) apply stroke health information for medical decision-making. A higher score would indicate a better self-reported stroke health literacy.</description>
