  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The AcuVid COVID-19 Rapid Antigen Saliva Test is a lateral flow immunoassay to detect&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigens in human saliva specimens from individuals suspected of&#xD;
      COVID-19 by their healthcare provider within the first seven days of symptom onset, or from&#xD;
      individuals without symptoms or other epidemiological reasons to suspect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The AcuVid COVID-19 Rapid Antigen Saliva Test performance will be compared to a high&#xD;
      sensitivity FDA EUA approved RT-PCR COVID-19 test. Nasopharyngeal (for RT-PCR) swab results&#xD;
      will be collected from subjects by healthcare providers at CLIA Waived COVID-19 Testing&#xD;
      Centers, and on the same day the subjects will also provide saliva samples which will be&#xD;
      tested and interpreted by the healthcare providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective, observational, study will test up to 300 participants to establish the&#xD;
      performance characteristics of the AcuVid test on saliva specimens.&#xD;

    <description>To establish the performance characteristics of the AcuVid COVID-19 Rapid Antigen Saliva Test in a point-of-care (POC) CLIA Waived setting with lay users (no laboratory experience) testing a participant that has self-collected a saliva specimen. Clinical accuracy of the AcuVid Test will be compared to RT-PCR test results. Accuracy refers to the (PPA, positive percent agreement (sensitivity) and (NPA, negative percent agreement (specificity) between the results of the AcuVid Test and the comparator RT-PCR test.</description>

        Study population will come from individuals visiting COVID-19 testing Centers for the&#xD;
        purpose of obtaining a COVID-19 RT-PCR test results. Individuals will be approached to&#xD;
        determine eligibility and obtain consent after they have provided a NP swab sample for&#xD;
        their COVID-19 RT-PCR test.&#xD;
