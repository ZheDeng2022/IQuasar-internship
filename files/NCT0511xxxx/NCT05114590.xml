  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to demonstrate if Soliqua 100/33 improves glycemic control (as&#xD;
      measured by Time in Range) and glycemic variability in participants with very uncontrolled&#xD;
      (HbA1c ≥ 9%) type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) while on at least 2 oral antidiabetic drugs&#xD;
      [OADs] with or without a glucagonlike peptide 1 receptor agonist [GLP1 RA]), as measured by&#xD;
      continuous glucose monitoring (CGM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total study duration per participant will be approximately 22 weeks. Three site visits, 3&#xD;
      site or home visits, and up to 13 phone contacts are scheduled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A screening period of up to 2 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A run-in period of up to 2 weeks and includes the baseline period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A 16-week, open-label treatment period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A 2-week post-treatment safety follow-up period&#xD;
