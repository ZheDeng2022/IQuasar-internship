      This stepped-wedge cluster-randomized controlled trial with nested mixed methods study will&#xD;
      assess the effectiveness, acceptability, feasibility and cost-effectiveness of a personal&#xD;
      protection package to reduce malaria transmission among mobile and migrant populations (MMPs)&#xD;
      and the general population in their residing villages in Lao People's Democratic Republic&#xD;
      (PDR) and Cambodia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the last decade, the burden of malaria has fallen dramatically in the Greater Mekong&#xD;
      Subregion, with deaths falling by 95% and cases by 76% between 2012 and 2019.The declining&#xD;
      malaria burden in GMS has largely attributed by the deployment of interventions of malaria&#xD;
      prevention tools such as long-lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLIN), and widespread availability&#xD;
      of rapid diagnostic tests and artemisinin combination therapies. However, residual&#xD;
      transmission still exists among high risk populations, particularly mobile and migrant&#xD;
      populations who enter forests for work. New interventions targetting these high risk groups&#xD;
      are needed if countries of the Greater Mekong Subregion are to achieve malaria elimination by&#xD;
      2030. The study will be conducted in malaria endemic areas of Lao PDR (Attapeu, Saravanh,&#xD;
      Savannakhet and Khammouane Provinces) and Cambodia (Preah Vihear, Stung Treng and Ratanakiri&#xD;
      Provinces) which have large forest going MMP populations. The aim of the study is to assess&#xD;
      the effectiveness, acceptability, feasibility and cost-effectiveness of a personal protection&#xD;
      package to reduce malaria transmission among mobile and migrant populations (MMPs) and the&#xD;
      general population in their residing villages in Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR) and&#xD;
      Cambodia. The personal protection package comprises a long-lasting insecticidal hammock net&#xD;
      (LLIHN), insect repellent (Icaridin), and a behavioural change communication (BCC) package&#xD;
      tailored to mobile and migrant populations. The study design is a stepped-wedge&#xD;
      cluster-randomized controlled trial with nested mixed methods study. The stepped-wedge&#xD;
      cluster randomized trial will estimate the effectiveness of a personal protection package&#xD;
      provided to forest-going MMPs (the intervention) delivered by village malaria volunteers at&#xD;
      the site (village/worksite) level on reducing Plasmodium spp. infections. Whilst the personal&#xD;
      protection package will be provided to mobile and migrant populations in each village in a&#xD;
      step-wise manner, primary and secondary outcomes relating to malaria testing will be&#xD;
      collected in all consenting individuals in the village who present for malaria rapid&#xD;
      diagnostic tests, whether they are mobile and migrant people or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The open stepped-wedge cluster-randomised controlled trial, randomized at the volunteer level&#xD;
      (i.e. the volunteer and the village / workplaces they service), will be implemented between&#xD;
      July 2021 to June 2022. The personal protection package for MMPs will be implemented&#xD;
      sequentially in a minimum of ~488 villages serviced by approximately ~488 VMWs (~428 in Lao&#xD;
      PDR and ~60 in Cambodia). Villages from each country will be randomised into 11 ordered&#xD;
      blocks, with blocks transitioned from control (no personal protection package) to&#xD;
      intervention (distribution of personal protection package) states at monthly intervals (10&#xD;
      blocks of 44 villages for the first 10 steps and a block of 48 villages transitioned at the&#xD;
      last step). This follows an initial baseline control period of one-month at the start of the&#xD;
      study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 11 RDTs per month will be undertaken in each study site (village/ worksite).&#xD;
      Given the design we estimate that the study has power to detect a relative minimum detectable&#xD;
      difference of 34% (OR = 0.66) in odds of RDT-detectable malaria infection due to the&#xD;
      intervention (assuming a village intraclass correlation [ICC]= 0.42; 5% significance; 90%&#xD;
      power and 1% RDT malaria prevalence).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the stepped-wedged cluster randomized trial, both descriptive and primary outcome trial&#xD;
      analyses will be performed. Using Stata version 15, differences in prevalence of Plasmodium&#xD;
      spp. infections will be estimated across intervention and control periods using generalized&#xD;
      linear mixed modelling (e.g. logit link function and binomial distribution) with crossed&#xD;
      random effects for village and time, and intervention state, time and seasonality estimated&#xD;
      as independent fixed factors. Temporal and spatial trends of Plasmodium spp. infections will&#xD;
      also be explored including analysis of the effectiveness of the intervention across the study&#xD;
      period. We will also explore any village-specific heterogeneity in effect by specifying a&#xD;
      random effect for the intervention. Generalised linear mixed modelling will be extended to&#xD;
      include model terms for country (main and interaction effects), and these will used to assess&#xD;
      the extent of country-specific heterogeneity in intervention effect. The same approach will&#xD;
      be used to assess risk group-specific heterogeneity (MMP, forest-goer, villager) in&#xD;
      intervention effect.&#xD;
