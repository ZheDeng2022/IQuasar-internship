  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study primarily seeks to evaluate dysfunction of small blood vessels and their linkage&#xD;
      to dysfunction of nerves in people with Type 2 Diabetes. The purpose of this research is to&#xD;
      explore some of the underlying pathophysiology of diabetic peripheral neuropathy,&#xD;
      particularly painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy. The pain experienced by individuals with&#xD;
      painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy is severe and associated with low quality of life. The&#xD;
      pain does not typically respond well to pharmacological management. The processes&#xD;
      underpinning the sources of pain are poorly understood, consequently only around a third of&#xD;
      patients benefit from existing treatments. Some historic research on the sources of pain&#xD;
      suggest the retention of the ability to reduce blood flow in small vessels may underpin these&#xD;
      pain pathways. This research aims to explore this possibility, looking at the nerve-linked&#xD;
      response in small vessels with a flickering light within the eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete three or four questionnaires: one demographic, two to aid with&#xD;
      stratifying participants into groups concerning symptoms of neuropathy and an additional&#xD;
      questionnaire if participants are stratified to the painful DPN group. A basic neurological&#xD;
      examination of the feet will follow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basic measurements of height, weight and blood pressure will be recorded for each&#xD;
      participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary sites of measurement of this small vessel dysfunction will be the eye and the&#xD;
      foot investigated in a non-invasive manner. A bright flickering light will be shone into&#xD;
      participants eyes, with the reaction of small vessels recorded. Sensors will also be placed&#xD;
      on the feet and chest of participants and warmed to ~44C. An image will be taken of&#xD;
      participants eyes to measure nerve layer thickness and an area of skin on the forearm will be&#xD;
      illuminated to measure for levels of a metabolic marker. A picture of the eye will also be&#xD;
      taken to determine nerve layer thickness.&#xD;

      This cross-sectional observational study will take place between November 2021 and May 2022&#xD;
      and will recruit individuals with Type 2 Diabetes alongside painful or non-painful peripheral&#xD;
      neuropathy. The study aims to determine the relationship between microvascular and metabolic&#xD;
      markers and i) clinical neuropathy, ii) of painful neuropathy and iii) severity of&#xD;
      neuropathic pain within a Type 2 Diabetic cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be done through achieving the following objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) determination of whether retinal vasodilation in response to flicker-light stimulus is&#xD;
      associated with i) the severity of neuropathy, ii) the presence of painful neuropathy and&#xD;
      iii) severity of neuropathic pain within a T2DM cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii) determination of whether levels of tissue-bound advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs)&#xD;
      measured by skin autofluorescence are associated with i) the severity of neuropathy, ii) the&#xD;
      presence of painful neuropathy and iii) severity of neuropathic pain within a T2DM cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii) determination of whether pedal skin transcutaneous oxygen tension (TcPO2) measured by&#xD;
      transcutaneous oximetry is associated with i) the severity of neuropathy, ii) the presence of&#xD;
      painful neuropathy and iii) severity of neuropathic pain within a T2DM cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iv)determination of whether retinal nerve layer thickness is associated with the severity of&#xD;
      neuropathy, the presence of painful neuropathy and severity of neuropathic pain within a T2DM&#xD;
      cohort v)determination of whether the following factors are associated with the severity of&#xD;
      neuropathy, the presence of painful neuropathy and severity of neuropathic pain within a T2DM&#xD;
      cohort&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HbA1c&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lipid profile&#xD;

    <description>Retinal vasodilation in response to flicker light stimulus - Response will be recorded as baseline corrected flicker response (bFR). Baseline will be recorded as the period from -30 to -5 seconds prior to flicker light stimulation. bFR will be calculated as the difference between peak dilation after provocation (dil%) and the minimum of the subsequent reactive constriction (constr%) and the width of the baseline amplitude (width BL%).</description>
