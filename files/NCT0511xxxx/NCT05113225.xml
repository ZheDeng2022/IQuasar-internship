      A sibling-Oocyte-split design will be conducted on oocytes before denudation and divided into&#xD;
      two groups : control group (MII oocytes will be injected using sperm processed by Density&#xD;
      gradient method) and sample group ( MII oocytes will be injected by sperm processed using&#xD;
      micro-swim up technique)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In This study investigators compare a novel sperm processing and selection method which is&#xD;
      (fast, cheap and safe) with the well known processing method of sperm &quot;Density gradient (DG)&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dishes will be prepared with droplets of handling medium for oocytes (droplet volume 10&#xD;
      μL), and an H pattern using PVP will be produced, finally, all the droplets will be overlaid&#xD;
      with mineral oil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group : Oocytes will be injected using sperm after processing with DG and will be&#xD;
      selected from control PVP microdroplets&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample group: Sperm will be directly loaded in specific ICSI dishes where is the PVP&#xD;
      microdroplets is prepared on &quot;H&quot; Pattern and will be selected from the far point from the&#xD;
      deposition point and will be injected into the oocytes from the sample group All injected MII&#xD;
      oocytes from both groups will then be cultured, with each group demarcated in separate place&#xD;
      in the culture dish then according to the randomisation embryo transfer will be selected from&#xD;
      one of both groups then the quality of the embryos will be reported and the pregnancy rate&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Single group of patients will be recruited in the study and each patient's oocytes will be divided into two groups and each group of patients will be injected with sperm processed by normal DG or H pattern micro- swim up technique. The PVP was used to produce the H pattern (length of about 2 cm from one side of the plate to the middle of the disk, total volume 10 μL). A small amount of semen (3 μL) was placed on one side of the H, and some time was allowed for it to migrate to the other side where the sperm was then collected. The dishes were incubated for three minutes allowing sperm migration along the outer perimeter of the H. After the completion of sperm migration, the plate was turned before the upload to avoid the contamination of the injection pipette by the sample.The injection pipette was introduced into the H-ICSI™ and used to immobilize a single sperm by crushing the membrane of its tail.</intervention_model_description>
