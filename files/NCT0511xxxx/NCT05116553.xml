      The aim of this study is to identify effective methodologies to help people to improve their&#xD;

      Subjects involved will have the opportunity to partecipate in a two-weeks course: two SDT&#xD;
      (Self Determination Theory) psychological interviews are scheduled (1 per week) to help the&#xD;
      participant increase his motivation and awareness about the problem reported during the&#xD;
      counseling session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this purpose, the use of an APP with a CA (Conversational Agent) will be implemented as a&#xD;
      support to help people to identify one's thoughts and emotional states as well as increase&#xD;
      their awareness about themselves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test will be administered at the beginning (T1) and at the end of the meetings (T2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly divided into one of two groups to understand whether APP and CA&#xD;
      has a significant impact in increasing motivation and awareness of the need for a pathway&#xD;
      with a professional.&#xD;
