  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: In the work with early mobilization (EM), in intensive care, several types of EM&#xD;
      are used A sitting in bed in semi- Fowler's position, sitting on the edge of the bed, and&#xD;
      sitting in a chair. Nowadays, it is often possible to achieve a comfortable sitting in the&#xD;
      beds in ICU. However, in a recent study by the same author group one of the findings was the&#xD;
      importance to get out of bed. Getting out of bed was associated with decreasing feelings of&#xD;
      hopelessness and being less ill. It also encouraged the will to fight for recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are few studies in intensive care that have examined what happens to circulation and&#xD;
      oxygenation in various forms of sitting. Studies that examined the patient's own experience&#xD;
      of sitting in bed compared to sitting in a chair are missing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is therefore to investigate physiological response and experience in patients in&#xD;
      intensive care when sitting in bed or in a chair Method: Repeated measures randomized&#xD;
      cross-over study Selection: Patients with respiratory and / or circulatory insufficiency&#xD;
      requiring intensive care, Inclusion criteria: Approximately 30 respiratory and circulatory&#xD;
      stable patients with emergency admission to intensive care. Aged over 18 years, who&#xD;
      understands Swedish. The patient and / or relative are asked after the physician in charge&#xD;
      has given medical approval. Recruitment is planned to be done by nurses in charge at the&#xD;
      unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: Patients who have undergone planned surgery without complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: The participants in the study will be measured in two different positions;&#xD;
      sitting in bed and sitting in chair. They are randomized to start either sitting in bed or in&#xD;
      a chair and will sit for 20 minutes in each position, at 4 - hour intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection, physiological variables: The following physiological variables will be&#xD;
      measured: Blood pressure and oxygenation by arterial needle and pulse by ECG. They will be&#xD;
      measured before the intervention, at the beginning of the intervention, after ten minutes, at&#xD;
      the end of the intervention and ten minutes afterwards Data collection, qualitative&#xD;
      variables: Rating of the experience of exertion, pain and satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis: Statistical analysis of differences between the two positions. For&#xD;
      quantitative variables that are normally distributed, paired t-tests will be used. For&#xD;
      qualitative variables and non-normally distributed quantitative variables, Wilcoxon character&#xD;
      rank test or Mc Nemar test will be used&#xD;
