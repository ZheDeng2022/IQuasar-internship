  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study investigators hypothesize that the intervention of case managers specifically&#xD;
      trained in case management of early psychosis will change the paradigm of care of a first&#xD;
      psychotic episode from the current organization of the care system. Indeed, the creation of&#xD;
      specific services for emerging psychotic disorders cannot easily be generalized throughout&#xD;
      the country and requires specific funding. The intervention of case managers according to the&#xD;
      recommendations of good practices will make it possible to propose the fundamental principles&#xD;
      of early intervention to young patients and their families on a large scale throughout the&#xD;
      territory, namely: personalized and proactive accompaniment, psycho-education of the&#xD;
      pathology and treatments, involvement and support of the families, and support for&#xD;
      socio-professional reintegration&#xD;
