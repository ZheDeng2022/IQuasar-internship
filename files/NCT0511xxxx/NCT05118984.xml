  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Meconium stained amniotic fluid increases the risk of maternal complications (e.g., dystocia,&#xD;
      operative delivery, and postpartum endometritis) and neonatal complications (e.g., sepsis,&#xD;
      admission to the neonatal intensive care unit [NICU], and meconium aspiration syndrome). The&#xD;
      goal of the study is to compare between Azithromycin vs Placebo in cases of meconium stained&#xD;
      amniotic fluid during the first stage of labor in multigravida women and their effect on&#xD;
      maternal and neonatal outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Meconium stained amniotic fluid, a troublesome situation both for obstetrician and&#xD;
      pediatrician, it is associated with high rates of caesarean section, perinatal morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. The rate of meconium-stained amniotic fluid varies from 12 to 20%.It is higher in&#xD;
      underdeveloped countries.Our study design would be a prospective randomized trial. Consented,&#xD;
      eligible pregnant women presenting during the first stage of labor at or more than 37 weeks&#xD;
      of gestation with meconium stained amniotic fluid will be randomized to receive Azithromycin&#xD;
      capsule (Zithromax, Pfizer) (250 mg / 12hrs on empty stomach for 3 days)(Group 1).Group 2&#xD;
      will be offered placebo capsules (manufactured in pharmacy department with the same shape,&#xD;
      color and consistency as Azithromycin capsule for 3 days).&#xD;

    <masking_description>Patients will be randomized to the 2 study groups according to a 2-block randomization list coded I or II at a 1:1 ratio. The randomization list will be prepared using a computer- generated random table by a statistician not otherwise involved in the study. The allocated groups will be masked in serially numbered sealed opaque envelopes that will be opened only after enrollment. Women who will be recruited give consent and open randomization envelopes in early labor, also the women will be recruited before revealing the allocation, the allocation will be blind to both the recruiter and the participant.</masking_description>
