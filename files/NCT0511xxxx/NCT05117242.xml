    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to investigate the safety and efficacy of GEN1046 as monotherapy&#xD;
      and in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with non-small cell lung cancer who have&#xD;
      failed previous standard of care.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This trial is a randomized, open-label trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of GEN1046 as&#xD;
      monotherapy and in combination therapy with pembrolizumab. The trial consists of two parts; a&#xD;
      safety phase and an extension phase. The extension phase will be initiated once the safety&#xD;
      phase is completed.&#xD;
