  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Behavioral economics principles have increasingly been shown to improve health outcomes in&#xD;
      the United States. They offer the ability to implement simple, low-cost and effective&#xD;
      interventions to address key health issues without sacrificing the autonomy of patients.&#xD;
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening is a key area where behavioral economics principles can&#xD;
      help improve health outcomes. Despite being the second leading cause of cancer related death,&#xD;
      the rate of CRC screening remains well below national targets. Interventions to address these&#xD;
      issues, and improve screening rates at our institution have including implementing a Mailed&#xD;
      FIT outreach program, and adding an informational letter that utilizes behavioral economic&#xD;
      principles. To further improve our screening rates, this project builds upon our previous&#xD;
      efforts to include a randomized electronic message primer via patients electronic patient&#xD;
      portal, to help alert them of incoming FIT Kit and complete screening. This study will&#xD;
      contribute to the growing literature of behavioral economics in medicine, while addressing an&#xD;
      important health issue.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of death from cancers affecting both men&#xD;
      and women in the United States. One in 17 Americans will suffer from CRC during his/her&#xD;
      lifetime. Early detection by screening has been shown to reduce CRC mortality. Despite&#xD;
      screening recommendations, the U.S. screening rate remains well below the national benchmark&#xD;
      of 80% as established by the National Colorectal Cancer Roundtable. The U.S. Multi-Society&#xD;
      Task Force (MSTF), however, does recommended FIT and colonoscopy as first line screening&#xD;
      modalities for CRC in 2017. To help address the issue of suboptimal CRC screening, the&#xD;
      investigators implemented an intervention utilizing the principles of behavioral economics to&#xD;
      improve screening rates. Studies in behavioral economics and psychology indicate that how&#xD;
      information or choice is framed impacts behavior in predictable ways, which has applications&#xD;
      in health and medicine, including the design of CRC screening strategies. This project builds&#xD;
      upon our institutions continued quality improvement efforts utilizing behavioral economics&#xD;
      principles to improve CRC screening, through improving the choice architecture, framing and&#xD;
      salience of information to incentivize routine screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this project the investigators will leverage our electronic health records (EHR) patient&#xD;
      portals to improve CRC screening. Specifically, the investigators developed an electronic&#xD;
      primer within the EHR patient portal to alert patients due for CRC screening before arrival&#xD;
      of a mailed FIT Kit. The investigators randomized implementation of the primer at the&#xD;
      patient-level to determine whether the electronic primer improved CRC screening completion in&#xD;
      patients enrolled in our mailed FIT program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For our analysis, after summarizing our demographic data, the investigators plan to compare&#xD;
      screening completion in the two study arms using an intention-to-treat analysis and t-tests.&#xD;
      The investigators then plan a logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards model to&#xD;
      compare time to screening utilization in the two study arms, controlling for age, sex, race,&#xD;
      and ethnicity. Following this the investigators use Fisher's exact tests to compare&#xD;
      completion of individual screening modalities in the two study arms. Lastly, the&#xD;
      investigators plan a secondary, analysis to determine the impact of opening the portal&#xD;
      message on screening utilization, using randomization arm as an instrumental variable. In&#xD;
      this analysis the investigators compare the subset of patients in the intervention group that&#xD;
      opened the portal primer message to the control group. P-values less than 0.05 are considered&#xD;
      statistically significant.&#xD;
