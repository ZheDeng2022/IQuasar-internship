  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intraoperative Neuromonitoring (IONM) is a tool used by neurophysiologists during spine&#xD;
      surgery to prevent irreversible damage to the spinal cord during procedures through a system&#xD;
      of alerts. This study investigates the effectiveness of IONM in 300 participants receiving&#xD;
      spine surgery. The goal of this study is to refine the alert criteria for procedures in which&#xD;
      IONM is used.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM) measures neural function and integrity&#xD;
      during surgical procedures. Through IONM, neurodiagnostic procedures can help determine&#xD;
      whether any nerves have become compressed or if the brain or spinal cord has any reduced&#xD;
      vascular flow, allowing the surgical team to take immediate and corrective actions to prevent&#xD;
      a bad outcome. Essentially, IONM acts as an early warning system for surgeons to gain&#xD;
      reliable insight into a patient's condition during surgery, adding a layer of safety to the&#xD;
      measures already in place that monitor cardiac and respiratory function while a patient is&#xD;
      anesthetized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose an observational research study to enhance the evidence-base for IONM. A novel&#xD;
      prospective neuromonitoring database will be implemented. In addition to the usual&#xD;
      contingency data to assess prediction accuracy, other measures will be examined:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A &quot;dose effect of injury&quot; assessment. Three categories of injury will be recorded by&#xD;
           physicians: (a) No New Deficit; (b) New Minor Deficit; and (c) New Severe Deficit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The outcome effect of intraoperative test frequency will be evaluated (infrequent vs&#xD;
           average vs very frequent), leading to a &quot;dose effect of neuromonitoring&quot; assessment.&#xD;
           Here we hypothesize that within our prospective sample, there is a relationship between&#xD;
           the proportion of total new neurological deficits (New Minor Deficit + New Severe&#xD;
           Deficit) and the frequency of IONM testing. More frequent testing is associated with&#xD;
           fewer total new neurological deficits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patient reported outcomes will be evaluated longitudinally in conjunction with clinical&#xD;
           outcomes data. Patient interviews will be conducted by a trained research assistant&#xD;
           aided by department technologists. Patient-reported neurological outcome assessments&#xD;
           will be supplemented/confirmed by review of in- and outpatient&#xD;
           surgical/neurophysiologist physician chart notes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from this proposed observational study will allow real-life outcomes based improvement&#xD;
      in the field of IONM.&#xD;
