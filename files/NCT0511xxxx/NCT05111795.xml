  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to further describe the general safety and clinical&#xD;
      performance of QuiremSpheresTM Holmium-166 Microspheres and QuiremScoutTM Holmium-166&#xD;
      Microspheres in a real-world post-market setting, with specific attention to outcomes per&#xD;
      tumor origin.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study, with an observational retrospective longitudinal design, is intended to collect&#xD;
      data from the devices (QuiremScoutTM Holmium-166 Microspheres, QuiremSpheresTM Holmium-166&#xD;
      Microspheres, and where available, Q-SuiteTM) used in a post-market, real-world setting. It&#xD;
      is non-comparative due to the retrospective nature of the study.&#xD;
