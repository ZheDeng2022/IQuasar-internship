    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) and chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) are relatively frequent&#xD;
      and potentially fatal diseases. However, studies that are comparing clinical outcomes between&#xD;
      CRC and CLTI patients in more advanced stages of the disease are lacking. The study aim was&#xD;
      to evaluate outcomes of patients with colorectal cancer liver metastases (CRLM) treated by&#xD;
      curative-intent liver resection and CLTI patients according to wound, ischemia, foot&#xD;
      infection (WIfI) classification by comparing the short- and long-term clinical outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is characterized by a global pandemic of growing&#xD;
      proportions. In 2016, The Global Burden of Disease study reported that 202 million adults&#xD;
      worldwide have PAD, with a higher prevalence compared to ischaemic heart disease (154&#xD;
      million), Alzheimer's disease (64 million) and cancer (43 million). The patient prognosis&#xD;
      after PAD occurrence is poor because the disease often progresses to chronic limb-threatening&#xD;
      ischemia (CLTI) that is an end-stage disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 5-year mortality risk in CLTI patients is about 60%. When the mortality risk of CLTI is&#xD;
      compared to mortality rates of the most common malignant diseases only six of them have a&#xD;
      higher 5-year mortality rate compared to CLTI. One of them is colorectal cancer (CRC). CRC is&#xD;
      the third most commonly occurring cancer in men and the second most commonly occurring cancer&#xD;
      in women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the latest CLTI treatment guidelines, the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS)&#xD;
      WIfI (wound, infection, ischemia) classification should be employed to stage limb condition&#xD;
      in patients with CLTI that is analog to the use of tumor, nodes, metastases (TNM) cancer&#xD;
      staging system. Recent data indicate that WIfI appears to correlate strongly with important&#xD;
      clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The annual incidence of CLTI is greater than the incidence of cancers characterized by high&#xD;
      mortality rates (esophageal, stomach, brain and ovarian). In addition, more people die from&#xD;
      CLTI each year compared to death rates of the already mentioned cancers. However, studies&#xD;
      that are comparing clinical outcomes between cancer and CLTI patients in more advanced stages&#xD;
      of the disease are lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aim was to evaluate outcomes of the wound, ischemia, foot infection (WIfI) stage IV&#xD;
      CLTI and colorectal cancer liver metastases (CRLM) patients managed by curative-intent liver&#xD;
      resection by comparing the short- and long-term clinical outcomes.&#xD;
