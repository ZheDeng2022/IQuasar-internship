  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer-related cognitive problems, also known as &quot;brain fog&quot;, have a significant impact on&#xD;
      patients with cancer and cancer survivors. Previous studies indicate that cancer and cancer&#xD;
      treatments can negatively affect memory, attention and thinking abilities. Adolescents and&#xD;
      young adults (AYAs) are individuals with a cancer diagnosis, who are currently between 18 to&#xD;
      40 years old. These individuals are especially vulnerable to brain fog symptoms due to the&#xD;
      effect these symptoms have on their education, employment, health behaviors, mental health,&#xD;
      and social relationships. There is a clear need for programming directed at brain fog&#xD;
      symptoms among AYAs with cancer diagnoses. The 'Coping with Brain Fog' program, developed by&#xD;
      Maximum Capacity Inc., is an eight-week group program that has been designed to educate&#xD;
      patients about their brain fog symptoms and develop strategies to manage these symptoms. In&#xD;
      this study we will aim to determine the feasibility of adapting the 'Coping with Brain Fog'&#xD;
      program to the virtual setting for AYAs with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will&#xD;
      also aim to explore the efficacy of the program on cognitive functioning and symptoms of&#xD;
      anxiety, depression and fatigue. This study is an important step towards finding ways to&#xD;
      treat brain fog symptoms in cancer patients, and could help guide future studies and&#xD;
      programs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Cancer-related cognitive deficits, also known as &quot;brain fog&quot;, are a&#xD;
      well-established morbidity among patients with cancer and cancer survivors. Associations&#xD;
      between cancer or cancer treatment with difficulties in short-term and working memory,&#xD;
      attention, processing speed, verbal fluency, and executive function have been previously&#xD;
      described. Adolescents and young adults (AYA) are individuals who have had a cancer diagnosis&#xD;
      and are currently between 18 to 40 years of age. Mitigating cognitive symptoms in the AYA&#xD;
      population is especially important, as these cognitive symptoms affect education and&#xD;
      employment, health behaviors, mental health, and social relationships. Further, as more AYAs&#xD;
      with cancer survive their cancer and live into adulthood, improving their quality of life is&#xD;
      even more vital. There is a clear need for programming directed at brain fog symptoms among&#xD;
      AYAs with a cancer diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The primary objective of this study is to determine the feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability/satisfaction of a virtual 'Coping with Brain Fog' intervention to AYAs with&#xD;
      cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. Secondary objectives of the study are to determine the&#xD;
      preliminary effect of the intervention on the cognitive functioning and symptoms of distress&#xD;
      (anxiety/depression/fatigue) of AYAs with cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This prospective pilot study will involve an 8-week virtual &quot;Coping with Brain Fog&quot;&#xD;
      program, with one 90-minutes session per week. The 'Coping with Brain Fog' program, developed&#xD;
      by Maximum Capacity Inc., has been designed as an in-person group program to educate&#xD;
      participants about brain fog and help them enhance their cognition and overall wellbeing.&#xD;
      Sessions are designed to enhance memory, task management, and psychological wellbeing skills.&#xD;
      Sessions will be delivered over Zoom in a group setting by a Master's-prepared registered&#xD;
      social worker and AYA psychosocial oncology clinician at CancerCare Manitoba. Individuals who&#xD;
      are between the ages of 18-40 and are (a) diagnosed with any type or stage of cancer, (b)&#xD;
      seeking intervention for self-reported symptoms of brain fog (such as poor memory, mental&#xD;
      slowness, or task insufficiency), and (c) currently living in Manitoba, Northwestern Ontario&#xD;
      or Nunavut, will be eligible for this study. Before starting the intervention, the study&#xD;
      participants will be sent a survey link to collect background patient information and measure&#xD;
      self-reported cognitive function and symptoms of distress. The participants will also&#xD;
      complete a post-intervention questionnaire to measure self-reported cognitive function,&#xD;
      symptoms of distress, and satisfaction within one week of completing the intervention and at&#xD;
      6-8 weeks after the intervention. Semi-structured exit phone interviews will be conducted&#xD;
      with the participants within two weeks of completing the intervention to collect their&#xD;
      narrative feedback and experiences with the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: This pilot project will help determine the feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability/satisfaction of a virtual 'Coping with Brain Fog' program and measure its&#xD;
      preliminary effects on cognitive function and symptoms of distress among AYAs with cancer.&#xD;

    <description>The proposed intervention is an 8-week 'Coping with Brain Fog' program for cancer survivors, adapted for AYAs with cancer, with one 90-minute group session per week. The intended group size for the program is 8-12 participants. The program was developed to be delivered in person, however for the purposes of this study it will be conducted in a virtual setting. The overall goals of the program are to educate participants about cancer-related brain fog and enhance their cognitive function and wellbeing. To accomplish this, the program is segmented into three main components: memory skills, task management, and psychological wellbeing. For each component, participants are systematically introduced to evidence-based strategies to cumulatively build a repertoire of cognitive tools designed to reduce the impact of cancer-related brain fog. The program uses a manual and participant materials that are copyrighted by Maximum Capacity Inc.</description>
