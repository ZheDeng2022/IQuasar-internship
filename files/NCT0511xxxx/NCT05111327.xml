  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High-fidelity simulation (HFS) has become a favorable innovative teaching-learning method to&#xD;
      facilitate students' learning in professional development in nursing. During the simulation,&#xD;
      a variety of skills can be improved through HFS. This mixed randomized-control and&#xD;
      qualitative study aims to examine the effects of the structured HFS guideline on PS, CR and&#xD;
      Student Satisfaction and Self-Confidence in Learning in undergraduate nursing students and&#xD;
      understand their learning experience in HFS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nurses are facing new challenges of immediate clinical management for safer and higher&#xD;
      quality of patient care in the current practice (Levette - Jones et al. 2018). Students are&#xD;
      required to have independent learning and higher-intellectual skills, including&#xD;
      problem-solving (PS) and clinical reasoning (CR), for pursuing better clinical judgements and&#xD;
      decision-making and the most cost-effective practice (Levette - Jones et al. 2018).&#xD;
      High-fidelity simulation (HFS) is one of the innovative and effective methods that allow&#xD;
      students to apply integrated knowledge and skills in a designed simulated case scenario to&#xD;
      develop higher-intellectual skills (Linn et al., 2012) and self-confidence. To allow students&#xD;
      to achieve their HFS with enhancement of skill development and self-confidence in learning, a&#xD;
      structured guideline is useful. This structured guideline can help course coordinators to&#xD;
      maintain consistence in simulation teaching. Therefore, this study aims to understand&#xD;
      students' skill development and self- confidence in learning through the HFS.&#xD;

    <description>Problem-solving Inventory (PSI) It consists of 32 items with a six-point Likert scale. The PSI includes three subscales: Problem-Solving Confidence (PSC) (11 items), Approach-Avoidance Style (AAS) (16 items) and Personal Control (PC) (5 items). PSC is to assess self-perceived confidence, belief and self-assurance effectively in solving problems. AAS is to measure an individual's tendency of response to approach or avoid problems. PC is to assess elements of self-control on emotions and behavior.</description>

    <description>Nurses' Clinical Reasoning Scale (NCRS) includes 15 items with a Likert five-point scale to assess students' CR competence. Higher scores indicate higher clinical reasoning competence.</description>

    <measure>Student Satisfaction and Self-Confidence in Learning</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Student Satisfaction and Self-Confidence in Learning consists of 13 items with 5-likert scales to measure students' perception of their satisfaction and self-confidence in learning. Five items are related to students' satisfaction in simulation-based learning activities and the remaining eight items concerns self-confidence in learning.</description>
