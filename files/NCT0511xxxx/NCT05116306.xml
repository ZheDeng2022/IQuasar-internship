      Clinical and Radiographic Evaluation of Hyaluronic Acid Compared to Propylene Glycol as&#xD;
      Vehicle for Double Antibiotic paste in Lesion Sterilization and Tissue Repair Technique for&#xD;
      Non-Vital Primary Molars(Randomized Clinical Trial and In Vitro Study) Introduction LSTR is&#xD;
      an acronym for lesion sterilization and tissue repair. It is a process which allows the use&#xD;
      of a combination of antibiotics (metronidazole, ciprofloxacin, and minocycline) mixed with&#xD;
      propylene glycol gel as a vehicle for controlling of oral infections such as dentinal,&#xD;
      pulpal, and periapical lesions. This therapy aims to eliminate causative bacteria from the&#xD;
      diseases by disinfecting the lesions and promoting tissue regeneration by the host's natural&#xD;
      tissue recovering process. Three types of antibiotics are combined to ensure complete removal&#xD;
      of all pathogenic microorganisms in pulpal and periapical lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a key element in the soft periodontal tissues, gingiva, and&#xD;
      periodontal ligament, and in the hard tissue, such as alveolar bone and cementum Based on the&#xD;
      multifunctional roles that HA has in wound healing generally, and that gingival and bone&#xD;
      healing follow similar biological principles, it is conceivable that HA has comparable roles&#xD;
      in the healing of the mineralized and nonmineralized tissues of the periodontium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, the purpose of this study is to compare the clinical and radiographic success of a&#xD;
      hyaluronic acid and propylene glycol as vehicles for antibiotic in LSTR in primary molars.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of Study A) Primary Objective • The aim of the present study is to evaluate the clinical&#xD;
      and radiographic success of hyaluronic acid compared to propylene glycol as vehicles for&#xD;
      antibiotics in LSTR for non-vital primary molars.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Both materials will be compared in terms of ease of handling, time to perform procedure and&#xD;
      convenience of application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PICOTS of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  P - Participants: Children both sexes aged from 5-7 years having pulpally involved&#xD;
           non-vital primary molars indicated for extraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  I - Intervention: LSTR with hyaluronic acid vehicle&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  C - Comparison: LSTR with propylene glycol vehicle (control)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  O -Outcomes: Clinical success: Reduction in pain, abnormal mobility, swelling/abscess&#xD;
           Radiographic success: Decrease in interradicular radiolucency and decrease of&#xD;
           pathological internal or external root resorption&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T-Time: one year follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  S-Study design: Randomized Clinical Trial Participants, Materials and Methods This study&#xD;
           composed of two parts: In vitro part ,as for the hyaluronic acid has two available forms&#xD;
           to be used (hyalgan and gengigel), a bacterial swap from non-vital pulp tissue will be&#xD;
           taken and bacterial activation of microorganisms will be held on suitable medium&#xD;
           according to the bacterial type, the two forms of hyaluronic acid will be mixed with the&#xD;
           two antibiotics under study and will be tested for their antibacterial efficacy to&#xD;
           determine the best form of hyaluronic acid form to be used in the in vivo part of the&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Vitro procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A sample from a non-vital pulp of primary molar root will be taken by paper point.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The sample will be cultivated in a suitable medium.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Bacterial strains will be identified through its medium.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Each bacterial strain would be isolated and cultivated separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The materials under investigation would be tested over each bacterial strain and&#xD;
           inhibition zone diameter will be measured after 24 hours of incubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The form of hyaluronic acid to be used in the in vivo study would be chosen according to&#xD;
           the measurement results of the inhibition zones resulted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II-In Vivo part:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The in vivo part of the study will be conducted as a randomized control trial, with 1:1&#xD;
      allocation ratio to either study group or control group, the RCT is the study design of&#xD;
      choice to test the null hypothesis and answer the research question.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study settings:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted at the outpatient clinic of the department of Pediatric Dentistry&#xD;
      and Dental Public Health, Faculty of Dentistry, Ain Shams University. This research will be&#xD;
      reviewed by the Research Ethics Committee and Institutional Review Board, Faculty of&#xD;
      Dentistry, Ain Shams University. A verbal as well as a written consent will be obtained from&#xD;
      the caregivers of the participants after explaining the objectives of the study and assuring&#xD;
      complete confidentiality of data. All caregivers and participants will be informed that they&#xD;
      have the right to withdraw from the study at any time. Moreover, participants 6 years and&#xD;
      older will verbally (orally) approve after an age-appropriate explanation of the trial&#xD;
      procedures and their objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment 36 molars will be selected from the outpatient clinic of the Department of&#xD;
      Pediatric Dentistry and Dental Public Health, Faculty of Dentistry, Ain Shams University.&#xD;
      Only patients who meet the inclusion criteria and sign the informed consent will be enrolled&#xD;
      in the study until the predetermined number of teeth is reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up Patients will be recalled for clinical and radiographic follow up after 3, 6 and 12&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical evaluation Teeth will be checked for the presence of pain, abscess, or mobility.&#xD;
      Radiographic evaluation The amount of furcation radiolucency in comparison to preoperative&#xD;
      radiograph Regeneration decrease in radiolucency Static remains the same Increase increase in&#xD;
      radiolucency&#xD;
