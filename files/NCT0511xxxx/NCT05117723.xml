  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer is the 5th leading cause of cancer death in Australia. Surgery remains the&#xD;
      most effective treatment for early pancreatic cancer and currently the only potential for&#xD;
      cure. Unfortunately, many patients present with advanced disease and are not suitable for&#xD;
      surgery. Therefore, it is vital to detect these cancers early. In the absence of significant&#xD;
      data from prospective studies, all of the guidelines are based on a critical review of&#xD;
      available data and consensus of experts. The primary aim is to delineate the progression of&#xD;
      IPMN to pancreatic malignancy as confirmed by surgical pathology, radiology and biochemical&#xD;
      diagnosis. The secondary aims are (i) To outline the management of IPMNs for those who have&#xD;
      progressed straight to surgery or surveillance by endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) (ii)To validate&#xD;
      the International consensus guidelines for management of IPMN - Fukuoka consensus guidelines&#xD;
      and tertiary aim to identify potential risk factors, if any that increase risk of malignancy&#xD;
      within the IPMNs.&#xD;

        Patients diagnosed with IPMN will be identified from consultations at each hospital site&#xD;
        with surgical and medical specialists with an interest in pancreatic conditions. This will&#xD;
        occur via consultations conducted in public clinic settings and from private consultations&#xD;
        and multi-disciplinary meetings.&#xD;
