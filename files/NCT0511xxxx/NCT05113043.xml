  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The relationship between the intestinal microecology and stroke has become a research hotspot&#xD;
      in neurology field today. Maintaining the balance of the intestinal microbiota are expected&#xD;
      to bring new breakthroughs for prevention and treatment of stroke. In recent years, stroke in&#xD;
      young adults has an increasing incidence and a considerable socioeconomic impact because of&#xD;
      high disability rate and health-care costs. So there is an urgent need to explore the role&#xD;
      and mechanism of intestinal microecology imbalance in stroke, especially in the development&#xD;
      and prognosis of stroke in young people. This study aims to use multi-omics technologies,&#xD;
      including microbial diversity, metagenomics and metabonomics, to reveal the characteristics&#xD;
      of intestinal flora in young stroke patients, identify biomarkers for predicting outcome&#xD;
      after stroke and early detection of young people at high risk of stroke, and to further&#xD;
      explore the role of gut-brain axis in the pathogenesis of stroke.&#xD;

        Young patients (18-45 years old) with ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, who are admitted&#xD;
        within 12 hours post-stroke are included. To avoid interfering factors, patients with&#xD;
        existing prior neurological disease or known tumors, inflammatory bowel disease and other&#xD;
        digestive system diseases, patients with serious life-threatening diseases or condition,&#xD;
        patients under antibiotics, probiotics or prebiotic treatment within 3 months before&#xD;
        stroke, and patients who deteriorate and die before collecting faecal samples are excluded.&#xD;
        Clinical data are documented, including age, gender, types of stroke as evidenced by&#xD;
        imaging examination and laboratory examination, etc.&#xD;
