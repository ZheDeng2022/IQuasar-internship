  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the COVID-19 epidemic, the time spent by adults on the stomach has increased.&#xD;
      Therefore, the likelihood of adverse changes in lifestyles has increased. In this study, the&#xD;
      changes in nutritional habits, physical activities and body weights of adult individuals&#xD;
      during the epidemic will be evaluated. A questionnaire including questions about nutritional&#xD;
      habits, physical activity status and changes in body weights will be administered to&#xD;
      individuals. The results will be evaluated with the appropriate statistical method. The&#xD;
      survey will be administered once. The estimated time to reach the total number is 3 months.&#xD;
