  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure with preserved ejection (HFpEF) disproportionately affects Veterans and is the&#xD;
      number one reason for hospital discharge in the VA Health Care System. Exercise intolerance&#xD;
      is a common complication experienced by patients with HFpEF, perpetuating physical inactivity&#xD;
      and accelerating disease progression. This research proposal aims to elucidate mechanisms&#xD;
      responsible for inadequate skeletal muscle blood flow and exercise intolerance in patients&#xD;
      with HFpEF compared with healthy controls as well as following 8 weeks of exercise training&#xD;
      in patients with HFpEF only.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) disproportionately afflicts&#xD;
      Veterans and is the leading cause of hospitalization and mortality within the VA Health Care&#xD;
      System. One chief symptom of HFpEF is severe exercise intolerance, an important predictor of&#xD;
      quality of life, functional capacity, and mortality. In these patients, severe exercise&#xD;
      intolerance is attributable to a disease-related loss of &quot;peripheral vascular control,&quot; as&#xD;
      evidenced by a marked attenuation in exercising skeletal muscle blood flow. Loss of&#xD;
      peripheral vascular control is manifested as dysfunctions of the autonomic nervous system&#xD;
      (ANS) and vasodilatory ability of the microvasculature, thereby restraining skeletal muscle&#xD;
      blood flow and O2 delivery and limiting the capacity for sustained physical activity. This&#xD;
      research proposal aims to elucidate peripheral vascular control mechanisms responsible for&#xD;
      inadequate skeletal muscle blood flow and exercise intolerance in patients with HFpEF. In&#xD;
      addition, there is some indication that aerobic exercise training may improve peripheral&#xD;
      vascular function in HFpEF , though the mechanisms have yet to be elucidated. Thus, an&#xD;
      additional aim of this research proposal is to evaluate peripheral vascular control&#xD;
      mechanisms of skeletal muscle blood flow and exercise tolerance following 8 weeks of exercise&#xD;
      training in patients with HFpEF. To test this, the initial phase will involve a&#xD;
      cross-sectional comparison of patients with HFpEF (n=35) and age and sex-matched healthy&#xD;
      controls (n=35), followed by an interventional phase where only patients with HFpEF will&#xD;
      enter 8 weeks of exercise training. It is anticipated that knowledge gained will (a) improve&#xD;
      the understanding of HFpEF pathophysiology and (b) determine the efficacy of a unique&#xD;
      exercise training modality to restore functional capacity and exercise tolerance in patients&#xD;
      with HFpEF.&#xD;

    <description>Patients with HFpEF will participate in the 8 weeks of supervised, two-legged, knee extensor exercise training for 3 days per week. Each exercise session will involve a 5-min warm-up and a 5-min cool-down, and exercise intensity will range between 40%-90% of maximal work rate. Maximal work rate will be re-assessed every two weeks.</description>
