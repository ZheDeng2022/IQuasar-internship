  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  Identify the degree of delirium in subjects with mild cognitive impairment and find the&#xD;
           risk factors of delirium. Mortality, hospital stay, and medical expenses are analyzed as&#xD;
           clinical consequences related to delirium incidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dementia conversion rate and conversion period of subjects with mild cognitive&#xD;
           impairment with delirium and it identifies the effect of delirium on dementia&#xD;
           conversion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Develop an AI(Artificial intelligence) algorithm for predicting dementia transition in&#xD;
           subjects with mild cognitive impairment based on the research results of the 1st, 2nd,&#xD;
           and 3rd years.&#xD;
