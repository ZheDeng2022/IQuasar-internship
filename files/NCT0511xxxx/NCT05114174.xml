  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The World Federation of Obesity warns that the main health problem of the next decade will be&#xD;
      childhood obesity. Furthermore, obesity and its consequences have been reported to originate&#xD;
      in intrauterine life. Gestational obesity produces profound effects on fetal genome&#xD;
      programming, thereby inducing changes in prenatal metabolism that extend to the postnatal&#xD;
      period, which is also associated with increased susceptibility to developing cardiovascular&#xD;
      and metabolic diseases in adulthood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Excessive maternal weight gain early in pregnancy has been repeatedly associated with&#xD;
      increased adiposity in childhood and adolescence of its offspring. Obesity is a complex&#xD;
      phenomenon influenced by social determinants of health, which include demographic,&#xD;
      socioeconomic, behavioral, environmental, and genetic factors. At the primary prevention&#xD;
      level, nutrition constitutes a modifiable risk factor during pregnancy. Therefore&#xD;
      establishing healthy nutritional behaviors during the first trimester of pregnancy is key to&#xD;
      the primary prevention of the intergenerational transmission of obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New ways of approaching the target population are required to maintain nutritional&#xD;
      recommendations as a priority in the daily decision-making (top of mind) of pregnant women.&#xD;
      For many women, this period is a powerful motivator for self-care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions based on behavioral theories provide a better understanding of the underlying&#xD;
      mechanisms that determine health-related behavior change and have the potential to be more&#xD;
      effective in promoting adherence to weight gain control. Social Cognitive Theory (TCS) is an&#xD;
      integrated model of behavior change commonly applied in mobile health interventions that&#xD;
      address diet, physical activity or weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mobile health programs (mHealth) are potentially more effective than face-to-face&#xD;
      interventions, especially during a public health emergency like the COVID-19 outbreak. This&#xD;
      proposal intends to &quot;deliver&quot; messages with evidence-based information directly to pregnant&#xD;
      women, in order to influence their nutritional behavior to avoid excessive gestational weight&#xD;
      gain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this proposal is that the mHealth intervention called &quot;mami-educ&quot;, which&#xD;
      consists of sending messages with nutrition counseling during pregnancy through the Telegram&#xD;
      platform, is effective in reducing excessive gestational weight gain in pregnant women&#xD;
      attending Family Health Care Centers in an urban and predominantly rural area.&#xD;
