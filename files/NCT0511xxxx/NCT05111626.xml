      The main objective of Part 1 is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of bemarituzumab plus&#xD;
      5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (mFOLFOX6) and nivolumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective Part 2 is to compare efficacy of bemarituzumab plus mFOLFOX6 and nivolumab&#xD;
      to placebo plus mFOLFOX6 and nivolumab as assessed by overall survival.&#xD;
