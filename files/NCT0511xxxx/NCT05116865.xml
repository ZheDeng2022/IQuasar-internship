  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled, dose escalation study of&#xD;
      HH-120 in healthy adult volunteers. HH-120 is a novel inhalable biologic being developed for&#xD;
      COVID-19 treatment. The study aims to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      profile of HH-120 administered by aerosol inhalation after single and multiple ascending&#xD;
      doses.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>

      Approximately 48 participants will be sequentially enrolled into either 1 of 3 SAD cohorts&#xD;
      (n=8 per cohort), or 1 of 3 MAD cohorts (n= 8 per cohort). An adaptive dose escalation&#xD;
      schedule will be employed for both SAD and MAD parts of the study.&#xD;
