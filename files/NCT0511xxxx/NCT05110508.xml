  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Active KC will involve delivering PA support tools to individuals interested in increasing&#xD;
      their physical activity. The tools involve provision of a Garmin wearable activity monitor&#xD;
      and participant-tailored behavior change supports (e.g., goal setting and monitoring)&#xD;
      delivered through text messaging and a corresponding study website.&#xD;

    <measure>Views of Participants on intervention via Focus Groups</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4, Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Up to 15 focus groups will be hosted throughout and after the intervention period. A subsample of participants will be selected to take part in focus groups conducted after week 4 and week 8. These focus groups will ask about participant experiences with the Garmin monitors and text messaging along with general perceptions of the intervention. Focus groups will be hosted virtually using Teams or in person and will be recorded. All participants will have the option to keep their cameras off during virtual focus groups.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive multiple weekly text messages. Texts will contain wear reminders, encouragements, congratulatory content, and behavior change messages based on the Garmin data. Some text message content asks for a response from the participant to help tailor later messages for behavior change support.</description>

    <description>Text intervention messaging will be sent through an automated text messaging service programmed by the CM Informatics team, which has been approved by the institution. Participants will be asked to wear Garmin physical activity monitor to provide physical activity information throughout the intervention. The Garmin is worn like a wristwatch. The device is small and non-intrusive. The Garmin device is a consumer wearable that will automatically detect and track activity such as walking, running, and cycling. The text messages incorporate information from the Garmin monitor to support physical activity.</description>
