  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project uses both transcriptomic- and genomic-level data to identify mechanisms of&#xD;
      individual responses to glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) in Mexican-Americans with&#xD;
      prediabetes. The GLP-1 hormone is essential for glucose reduction, weight loss,&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk reduction, and renal protection. Newly discovered mechanisms will&#xD;
      illuminate causal links between disease genotype and phenotype, which may ultimately guide&#xD;
      personalized therapeutic approaches for type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, obesity, cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease, renal disease, and other related diseases.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial will uncover new mechanisms of inter-individual responses to endogenous&#xD;
      and exogenous glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) in Hispanics/Latinos (H/Ls) with prediabetes.&#xD;
      The results move the management of prediabetes, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and relevant&#xD;
      metabolic diseases to a more individualized approach in an understudied and at-risk&#xD;
      population. Few options exist for prediabetes treatment, and the current pharmaceutical&#xD;
      management of T2DM does not predict drug treatment failures, nor differences in individual&#xD;
      treatment responses and adverse effects. A precise, genetics-based approach will provide&#xD;
      superior therapeutic management for patients. GLP-1-based therapies reduce blood glucose,&#xD;
      promote weight loss, decrease cardiovascular events, and improve renal function. Prior&#xD;
      genetic studies, most done in Caucasians, identified associations between genetic variants&#xD;
      and decreased GLP-1-induced insulin secretion, in an effort to guide individualized&#xD;
      treatment. However, these associations do not provide a clear mechanistic relationship&#xD;
      between genotype and phenotype. Transcriptomic analyses will uncover many of these&#xD;
      mechanisms. Here, we propose to 1) test the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms&#xD;
      (SNPs) that regulate expression (eQTLs) of 11 candidate genes in a range of relevant&#xD;
      metabolic tissues with differential GLP-1 response, 2) perform RNA sequencing before and&#xD;
      after treatment to identify eQTLs in blood that predict response to GLP-1 therapy and develop&#xD;
      risk-based prediction models in H/Ls, and 3) determine the effects of genetic regulation of&#xD;
      candidate genes and newly discovered eQTLs phenome-wide in a large existing biobank, BioVU.&#xD;
      For aims 1 and 2, responses will be measured in 300 study subjects with prediabetes recruited&#xD;
      from an established Mexican-American cohort via the oral minimal model method, before and&#xD;
      after GLP-1 therapy, quantifying GLP-1 hormone efficacy and GLP-1-induced pancreatic beta&#xD;
      cell insulin release and peripheral insulin sensitivity. Procedures include serial&#xD;
      measurements of plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide, and GLP-1, and peripheral blood&#xD;
      collection for RNA sequencing. Our central hypotheses are: (1) metabolic tissue-based eQTLs&#xD;
      of GLP-1-associated genes will be associated with physiological response to endogenous and&#xD;
      exogenous GLP-1,(2) identification of eQTLs associated with GLP-1 treatment-induced changes&#xD;
      in whole blood will identify new gene targets, and (3) this data will lead to the creation of&#xD;
      eQTL-based prediction models for related diseases. The study is innovative because it uses a&#xD;
      novel combination of eQTL analysis and oral minimal model to assess GLP-1 response, examines&#xD;
      a population highly underrepresented in pharmacogenomic studies, and utilizes novel&#xD;
      statistical methods and applications to study gene expression. The significance of this newly&#xD;
      acquired mechanistic information will ultimately guide precision therapeutic regimens for&#xD;
      diabetes prevention and treatment, weight loss, cardiovascular risk reduction, and related&#xD;
      metabolic complications in an understudied population.&#xD;
