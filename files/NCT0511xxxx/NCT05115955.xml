  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pain is common, and the pain intensity can be moderate to severe depending on&#xD;
      the site of surgery during the first few days after surgery, and an estimated 15% to 45%&#xD;
      experience chronic postsurgical pain. When poorly controlled, the pain can have a significant&#xD;
      effect on patient recovery. Proper management of postoperative pain is needed to relieve&#xD;
      suffering and lead to earlier mobilization, shortened hospital stay, reduced hospital costs,&#xD;
      and increased patient satisfaction. The currently proposed clinical use of Dinalbuphine&#xD;
      Sebacate is to administer a single dose of NALDEBAIN® intramuscularly approximately 12 to 24&#xD;
      hours prior to the planned surgery for pain relief. Several clinical studies of NALDEBAIN®&#xD;
      have been published, such as the use in laparotomy and laparoscopic cholecystectomy. However,&#xD;
      toward the arthroscopic shoulder surgery, no article or report has been available publicly&#xD;
      yet. The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of single&#xD;
      doses of intramuscular NALDEBAIN® on patients scheduled to undergo arthroscopic shoulder&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study. Patients scheduled to undergo&#xD;
      arthroscopic shoulder surgery will be invited to participate in this study. After obtaining&#xD;
      the written informed consent, each subject should be sequentially assigned an individual&#xD;
      screening number instead of his/her name, chart number or identification. Subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized to two groups, DS group and Control group. Both groups should be treated with both&#xD;
      routine analgesic regimen and a dose of investigational product. Random numbers and&#xD;
      assignment treatment were generated by computer program before this study initiated.&#xD;
      Statistical analyses should be performed on the data to compare the two groups. Numerical&#xD;
      variables will be present with mean and standard deviation and categorical variables will be&#xD;
      present with number and percentage.&#xD;
