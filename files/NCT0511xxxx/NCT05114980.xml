      Options for treatment of severe, refractory hypocalcemia are limited for the thousands of&#xD;
      patients in the United States who suffer from hypoparathyroidism. Parathyroid&#xD;
      allotransplantation is an emerging treatment that provides hope for these individuals.&#xD;
      Currently, this therapy has only been successfully provided by a few centers in the world. In&#xD;
      the UAB PATH trial, we propose to become one of the few centers worldwide to successfully&#xD;
      achieve parathyroid allotransplantation in transplant-naïve patients.&#xD;

      Hypoparathyroidism (HypoPT) is a clinical condition characterized by hypocalcemia and low&#xD;
      parathyroid hormone levels (PTH). HypoPT is most often the result from previous neck surgery&#xD;
      such as thyroidectomy, parathyroidectomy and cervical dissection. It can also result in&#xD;
      autoimmune damage to parathyroid glands or genetic disorders. Based on analysis of a large&#xD;
      health plan claims database, the estimated prevalence of hypoparathyroidism in the United&#xD;
      States is 77,000 cases.[1] Most patients with symptoms present with neuromuscular&#xD;
      irritability such as muscle spam, paresthesia, laryngospasm and seizure. Long-term&#xD;
      complications from HypoPT include renal impairment, cataracts and basal ganglia&#xD;
      calcification.[2] A health-related quality of life (QoL) survey across 13 countries showed&#xD;
      that 84% of patients reports impacts for ability to exercise (84%), sleep (78%), ability to&#xD;
      work (75%) and family relationships (63%).[3] Hypoparathyroidism is typically managed with&#xD;
      calcium, vitamin D and at times, thiazide diuretics. Acute hypocalcemia or severe symptomatic&#xD;
      hypocalcemia may require intravenous calcium administration. Recombinant Human(rh) PTH (1-84)&#xD;
      was approved by the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the management of&#xD;
      hypoparathyroidism in 2015.[4] Studies showed that rhPTH (1-84) can reduce the need for&#xD;
      supplemental calcium and active vitamin D and improve patients' QoL. However, rhPTH (1-84) is&#xD;
      only available through a registry known as Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS)&#xD;
      due to its potential risk for development of osteosarcoma, and patients are not frequently&#xD;
      able to remain on this medication for the long-term.[5] Also not every patient is responsive&#xD;
      to rhPTH.[6] Thus, an alternative, less costly and effective treatment is required to&#xD;
      physiologically restore parathyroid function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parathyroid gland transplant (PGTx) has been explored for the past 60 years. Groth et al.&#xD;
      reported the first case of parathyroid allotransplant in 1973. A 46 year-old male who&#xD;
      underwent subtotal parathyroidectomy due to secondary hyperparathyroidism in 1970 developed&#xD;
      hypoparathyroidism after cadaveric renal transplantation. Four separate pieces of homologous&#xD;
      hyperplastic parathyroid tissue were implanted into his pectoralis muscle 52 days after renal&#xD;
      transplantation in 1971. He was able to stop all supplementation 2 months after PGTx and his&#xD;
      serum calcium and phosphorus had been within normal limits in the next 12 months.[7] Since&#xD;
      then, several successful cases of PGTx were performed on renal transplant recipients across&#xD;
      the world. Of all these cases, patients has already been on immunosuppressants. [8-13] A&#xD;
      online survey regarding patients' view about parathyroid transplantation was conducted in the&#xD;
      United Kingdom in 2018. Two thirds of patient interested in further development of&#xD;
      parathyroid transplantation. The main concern was the possible need for immunosuppressive&#xD;
      therapy.[14] Several case reports attempted to use cell culture techniques [15] and&#xD;
      microencapsulation[16] to reduce immunogenicity to avoid immunosuppressants. However, the&#xD;
      allograft survival rate was low comparing to patients who take immunosuppressants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Case Reports of PGTx in non-transplant recipients who received immunosuppressants after&#xD;
      transplant were reported first in Mexico in 2015 and in Germany in 2016. Hermosillo-Sandoval&#xD;
      et al. in Mexico reported in their case series that 5 patients with iatrogenic&#xD;
      hypoparathyroidism received PGTx from donors of primary hyperparathyroidism. In the 2-year&#xD;
      follow up, all patients reduced calcium supplement from an average of 8.4g calcium carbonate&#xD;
      per day to an average of 6g/day with no immunosuppression related complications reported.&#xD;
      Sestamibi scintigraphy and Doppler ultrasound showed 4 patients had radiopharmaceutical&#xD;
      uptake with blood flow. [17] Agha et al. in Germany reported a case of a 32-year old female&#xD;
      with iatrogenic refractory hypoparathyroidism receiving two normal parathyroid glands from&#xD;
      her brother. The recipient stopped PTH (1-1-84) after transplantation and PTH levels remained&#xD;
      within the normal range for three years after transplantation. Neither the donor nor&#xD;
      recipient experienced any surgical complications.[6]&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a non-randomized pilot study that will evaluate feasibility of parathyroid&#xD;
      allotransplantation using deceased donors to treat medically refractory hypoparathyroidism in&#xD;
      transplant-naïve patients. Patients with permanent refractory hypoparathyroidism will be&#xD;
      referred to parathyroid team via comprehensive transplant institute (CTI), endocrine surgery&#xD;
      office, faxed referral form, MD to MD personal relationship and access center. Based upon&#xD;
      review of referral, the parathyroid team will decide if patient is a candidate for&#xD;
      evaluation. If patient meets the selection criteria, the parathyroid team will begin the&#xD;
      telephone screening. Parathyroid team will order the required evaluation labs (Vitamin D25 OH&#xD;
      level, comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), complete blood count (CBC) with differential&#xD;
      count, parathyroid hormone (PTH) level, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) testing and ABO x 2).&#xD;
      The parathyroid team will schedule virtual consults for surgery, nutrition, pharmacy, social&#xD;
      work, transplant financial coordinator, and transplant education. In-person clinic visits&#xD;
      will occur at MD discretion. Evaluation patients will be presented by the Transplant MD and&#xD;
      discussed by the multidisciplinary team to determine suitability for transplant. If candidate&#xD;
      is suitable for transplant, proceed with listing process and expectations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Legacy of Hope (LOH), the Organ Procurement Organization, will notify parathyroid surgeon of&#xD;
      any offers. Once accepted, the parathyroid surgeon will contact the kidney Pre-Transplant&#xD;
      Coordinator (PTC) on call regarding organ offer and crossmatch on potential transplant&#xD;
      candidates. If suitable for organ offer, the parathyroid team will contact patient and begin&#xD;
      the admission process. The endocrine procurement team will prepare parathyroid glands for&#xD;
      explant using standard surgical techniques. Biopsies of each candidate parathyroid will be&#xD;
      obtained and sent for frozen section. The Pathologist on-call will evaluate the procured&#xD;
      specimen to confirm the tissue as parathyroid glands. All glands will be combined in one&#xD;
      specimen cup in perfusion solution. The specimen will be kept on iced saline for transport.&#xD;
      The specimen will transported to UAB using standardized protocols for transplant organ tissue&#xD;
      handling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recipient will receive 250mg methylprednisolone intravenous in the operating room for&#xD;
      induction immunosuppression. The parathyroid transplantation will be performed under local&#xD;
      anesthesia using well established technique of implanting parathyroid tissue in the&#xD;
      non-dominant brachioradialis muscle. The recipient will be transferred back to the ward after&#xD;
      the procedure for observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will start on postoperative immunosuppression and postoperative prophylaxis based on&#xD;
      UAB protocol. The patient is discharged on the same day as the procedure. In the pre-graft&#xD;
      function phase, the patient will receive a daily phone check-in with labs every other day&#xD;
      including CBC, basic metabolic panel (BMP), PTH, ionized calcium and tacrolimus level, and&#xD;
      clinic visits twice weekly with surgeon-performed ultrasound of graft. In the post-graft&#xD;
      function phase, patients will receive weekly labs for 3 months including CBC, CMP, PTH,&#xD;
      tacrolimus and weekly clinic visit for 3 months. Afterwards, patient will start monthly&#xD;
      clinic visits for 1 year. Patients will also obtain donor-specific antibody (DSA) testing at&#xD;
      1, 3, 6 months after transplant and every 3 months thereafter.&#xD;
