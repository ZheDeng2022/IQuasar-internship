      This randomized, double-blind, single center, placebo-controlled, phase 1 single ascending&#xD;
      dose (SAD)/multiple ascending dose (MAD) study is designed to assess the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, PK, activity, immunogenicity, and PD of BSI-045B. Approximately 68 subjects&#xD;
      will be enrolled. Subjects in this study include 56 healthy volunteers (HVs) and 12 patients&#xD;
      with AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is divided into 3 parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Part A: Evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, immunogenicity, and PD of single&#xD;
           ascending doses of BSI-045B administered as a subcutaneous (SC) injection of 120, 240,&#xD;
           480, and 720 mg to HVs&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Part B: Evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, activity (as measured by the Eczema Area&#xD;
           and Severity Index [EASI] score), immunogenicity, and PD of a single dose of BSI-045B&#xD;
           administered as a SC injection of 480 mg to patients with AD&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Part C: Evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, immunogenicity, and PD of multiple&#xD;
           ascending doses of BSI-045B administered as five (5) SC injections of 240, 480, and 600&#xD;

      This study is a phase 1 clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity,&#xD;
      PK profile, activity, and PD of BSI-045B injection after single/multiple doses in adult HVs&#xD;
      and patients with AD using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. It consists&#xD;
      of 3 parts: a SAD study in HVs, a single dose study in patients with AD, and a MAD study in&#xD;
      HVs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A: Single Ascending Dose in HVs The SAD study in HVs will consist of single ascending&#xD;
      doses in a 4-cohort design. Cohorts 1, 2, 3, and 4 will each consist of 8 HVs (6 Active: 2&#xD;
      Placebo). The total number of HVs to be enrolled in Part A is 32.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in Part A will be enrolled as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1: HVs (Active:Placebo 6:2), 120 mg, single dose; n = 8 Cohort 2: HVs (Active:Placebo&#xD;
      6:2), 240 mg, single dose; n = 8 Cohort 3: HVs (Active:Placebo 6:2), 480 mg, single dose; n =&#xD;
      8 Cohort 4: HVs (Active:Placebo 6:2), 720 mg, single dose; n = 8 The preferred SC injection&#xD;
      site is the abdomen. Multiple SC injections required for higher dose cohorts should be&#xD;
      administered no more than 1 minute apart. The thigh can be used as an alternative site for SC&#xD;
      injections. In Cohort 1, a 1 mL injection of 120 mg/mL (120 mg total dose) will be&#xD;
      administered at a single SC injection site. In Cohort 2, a 2 mL injection of 120 mg/mL (240&#xD;
      mg total dose) will be administered at a single SC injection site. In Cohort 3, two 2 mL&#xD;
      injections of 120 mg/mL will be administered simultaneously at 2 separate SC injection sites&#xD;
      for a total of 4 mL (480 mg total dose). In Cohort 4, three 2 mL injections of 120 mg/mL will&#xD;
      be administered simultaneously at three separate SC injection sites, for a total of 6 mL (720&#xD;
      mg total dose).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B: Single Dose in Patients with AD The total number of patients with AD to be enrolled&#xD;
      in the single-dose study in Part B is 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following a thorough assessment of safety, tolerability, and PK at Week 11 and Week 12 of the&#xD;
      HVs treated with 480 mg in Part A, subjects will be enrolled into Part B (so that Day 1 of&#xD;
      Part B will correspond to Day 1 of Week 13 of Part A).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with AD will be enrolled as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1: Patients with AD (Active:Placebo 9:3), 480 mg, single dose; n = 12 The preferred SC&#xD;
      injection site is the abdomen. Injections should be administered no more than 1 minute apart.&#xD;
      The thigh can be used as an alternative site for SC injections. Patients with AD will be&#xD;
      administered two separate 2 mL injections of 120 mg/mL simultaneously at two separate SC&#xD;
      injection sites, for a total of 4 mL (480 mg total dose).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management of SAD HV Cohort (Part A) and Single-Dose Cohort, Patients with AD (Part B)&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers and patients with AD will be admitted to the phase 1 clinical site 1 day&#xD;
      before each dose administration. In this phase 1 study of BSI-045B, sentinel dosing will be&#xD;
      used for each of the SAD cohorts. The first 2 HVs and AD patients in each cohort will receive&#xD;
      either BSI-045B or placebo in parallel (1 Active:1 Placebo), followed by a 3 day gap to allow&#xD;
      for the evaluation of safety and tolerability before administering the same dose of BSI-045B&#xD;
      or placebo to the remaining HVs (5 Active:1 Placebo) or AD patients (8 Active:2 Placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers and patients with AD will be confined at the clinical site to assess&#xD;
      tolerability, safety, and adverse events (AEs), and for collection of blood samples for PK&#xD;
      analysis. After 9 days of evaluation, HVs or patients with AD will leave the phase 1 clinic&#xD;
      after completion of the clinical assessments. Follow-up visits at scheduled time points will&#xD;
      be conducted to evaluate safety, tolerability, PK, immunogenicity, and biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All decisions concerning dose escalation will be made by a Safety Review Committee composed&#xD;
      of representatives from Biosion (at a minimum, the clinical science representative and&#xD;
      pharmacovigilance physician, or appropriate delegates), the Principal Investigator and an&#xD;
      independent member. The Investigator, Biosion personnel, and HVs or patients will remain&#xD;
      blinded throughout the study. Pharmacy staff preparing the study medications will be&#xD;
      unblinded. If unblinding is necessary for a specific subject, emergency unblinding may be&#xD;
      arranged after approved by the Principal Investigator and discussed with the Medical Monitor.&#xD;
      Dose escalation meetings will be carried out in accordance with the Safety Review Committee&#xD;
      Charter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up assessments will occur on Day 15 and during subsequent visits to the clinic for PK&#xD;
      blood draws through Day 113 (the termination of each cohort in the SAD study). Adverse events&#xD;
      will be collected through Day 113 to determine whether there are ongoing AEs, serious adverse&#xD;
      events (SAEs), worsening of AEs or SAEs, or development of new AEs or SAEs. Concomitant&#xD;
      medications taken after the final dose of BSI-045B or placebo will be recorded through Day&#xD;
      113. Follow-up will occur during clinic visits and if abnormal, clinically significant&#xD;
      findings are observed upon discharge. At the Investigator's discretion, volunteers may be&#xD;
      brought back to the clinic for re-evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part C: Multiple Ascending Doses in HVs The MAD study will consist of multiple ascending&#xD;
      doses in 3 cohorts. Cohorts 1, 2, and 3 will consist of 8 HVs (6 Active:2 Placebo). The MAD&#xD;
      study will enroll a total of 24 HVs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MAD Part C portion of the study will commence after pharmacokinetic and safety&#xD;
      information from the 2nd cohort (240 mg total dose) of the HV SAD portion of the study has&#xD;
      been evaluated and approved by the Safety Review Committee. Sequential groups of HVs will&#xD;
      receive SC injections of BSI-045B Q7D for a total of 5 doses. BSI-045B (or placebo) will be&#xD;
      administered as single- or multiple-site SC injection(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in Part C will be enrolled as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1: HVs (Active:Placebo 6:2), 240 mg Q7D, 5 doses; n = 8 Cohort 2: HVs (Active:Placebo&#xD;
      6:2), 480 mg Q7D, 5 doses; n = 8 Cohort 3: HVs (Active:Placebo 6:2), 600 mg Q7D, 5 doses; n =&#xD;
      8 Healthy volunteers will be admitted to the phase 1 clinical site 1 day before each dose&#xD;
      administration and will be discharged on Day 9 (after dose 2 on Day 8), the following day, 24&#xD;
      h post-dose for doses 3 and 4 and on Day 37 after dose 5. BSI-045B or placebo will be&#xD;
      administered in the morning of the first day of each administration. The preferred SC&#xD;
      injection site is the abdomen. Multiple SC injections required for higher dose cohorts should&#xD;
      be administered no more than 1 minute apart. The thigh can be used as an alternative site for&#xD;
      SC injections. For each dose administration, SC dosing should alternate between the left and&#xD;
      right sides of the abdomen or left and right thigh. In Cohort 1 (240 mg), a 2 mL injection of&#xD;
      120 mg/mL will be administered at a single SC injection site. For Cohort 2 (480 mg), two 2 mL&#xD;
      injections of 120 mg/mL of drug or placebo will be administered simultaneously at two&#xD;
      separate SC injection sites, for a total of 4 mL. In Cohort 3 (600 mg), two separate 2 mL&#xD;
      injections of 120 mg/mL of drug or placebo and a 1 mL injection of 120 mg/mL will be&#xD;
      administered simultaneously at 3 separate SC injection sites, for a total of 5 mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers will be confined to the clinic to assess safety, tolerability, PK, and&#xD;
      immunogenicity. Adverse events will be recorded and blood samples will be collected for PK&#xD;
      analysis. After 9 days of evaluation, HVs will leave the phase 1 clinic after the PK blood&#xD;
      draw. Follow-up visits will be conducted at scheduled time points. HVs will return for&#xD;
      admission to the unit 1 day prior to dosing for doses 3, 4 and 5 on Days 15, 22, and 29&#xD;
      respectively, and will be discharged 24 h post dose after doses 3 and 4 and on Day 37 after&#xD;
      the final dose (dose 5).&#xD;

                  Screening or on Day -1. Entry of any subject with an abnormal (not clinically&#xD;
                  significant) ECG must be approved and documented by signature of the Principal&#xD;
                  Investigator or medically qualified Sub-Investigator. In the case of a corrected&#xD;
                  QT interval (Fridericia) (QTcF) &gt;450 ms or &gt;470 ms (HVs or AD patients with&#xD;
                  bundle branch block) or PR interval outside the range of 115 to 220 ms,&#xD;
                  assessment may be repeated once for eligibility determination at Screening and/or&#xD;
                  on Day -1.&#xD;
&#xD;
              19. The subject has a supine systolic blood pressure &lt;90 or &gt;144 mm Hg or a supine&#xD;
                  diastolic blood pressure &lt;50 or &gt;94 mm Hg. If out of range, assessment may be&#xD;
                  repeated once for eligibility determination at Screening and/or on Day -1.&#xD;
&#xD;
              20. The subject has a resting heart rate &lt;40 or &gt;90 bpm (not on ECGs) and considered&#xD;
                  clinically significant by the Investigator. If out of range, the assessment may&#xD;
                  be repeated once for eligibility determination at Screening and/or on Day -1.&#xD;
&#xD;
              21. The subject has abnormal laboratory values at Screening that suggest a clinically&#xD;
                  significant underlying disease, or the subject has the following laboratory&#xD;
                  abnormalities: alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or aspartate aminotransferase&#xD;
                  (AST) &gt;1.5 times the upper limit of normal unless otherwise agreed to by the&#xD;
                  Sponsor and Principal Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In addition to the general criteria above, AD patients in Part B must meet the following&#xD;
        inclusion criteria to enter the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The patient has a diagnosis of AD (according to the criteria established by Hanifin et&#xD;
             al, 2001 and Rajka et al, 1989).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The EASI score is ≥15 at Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The score on the Investigator's Global Assessment is ≥3 at Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The score on the SCORing Atopic Dermatitis instrument is ≥20 at Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The total body surface area affected by AD is ≥10% as assessed by the EASI at&#xD;
             Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The patient has an inadequate response to topical medications, or topical treatment is&#xD;
             medically inadvisable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In addition to the general criteria above, AD patients in Part B must not meet any of the&#xD;
        following exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The patient has another dermatologic condition that might confound a diagnosis of AD&#xD;
             or a treatment assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The patient has a history of anaphylaxis following biologic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The patient has a history of clinically significant infections within 4 weeks prior to&#xD;
             Day -1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The patient has a diagnosis of helminthic parasitic infection within 6 months prior to&#xD;
             Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The patient has received any marketed or investigational biologic agent within 5&#xD;
             half-lives prior to Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The patient has received treatment with immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory drugs&#xD;
             without adequate washout, or has received phototherapy for AD within 4 weeks prior to&#xD;
             Day 1. For drugs, an adequate washout period is 5 half-lives (e.g., 10 weeks for&#xD;
             dupilumab).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. The patient has initiated treatment with topical corticosteroids (TCS) or topical&#xD;
             calcineurin inhibitors within 1 week prior to Day -1. If rescue medications are deemed&#xD;
             warranted by the PI class IV TCS may be used as rescue medication after Day -1 (see&#xD;
             Table 13).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. The patient has initiated treatment with prescription moisturizers or moisturizers&#xD;
             containing additives such as ceramide, hyaluronic acid, urea, or filaggrin degradation&#xD;
             products during the Screening period (patients may continue to use stable doses of&#xD;
             such moisturizers if initiated before the Screening visit, but should not change to a&#xD;
             different product during the study).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. The patient plans to use any other prohibited medication or undergo any prohibited&#xD;
             procedure during the study. Oral antibiotics are permitted. Bleach baths are not&#xD;
             permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. The patient has received any investigational compound within 30 days or 5 half-lives&#xD;
             (whichever is greater) days prior to Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. The subject has a risk of suicide per the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (a&#xD;
             score of 4 or above on ideation or any suicidal behavior) or according to the&#xD;
             Investigator's clinical judgment, has made a suicide attempt in the previous 6 months,&#xD;
             or has a history of deliberate self-harm in the past 6 months. A subject with a lower&#xD;
             score may be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. The patient has any clinically relevant abnormal finding.&#xD;
