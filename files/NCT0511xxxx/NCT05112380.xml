      The reliability of the Xco endurance test will be assessed in sedentary adults and in&#xD;
      overhead athletes. The experimentation will be divided into two sessions. During the&#xD;
      sessions, the impact of the test on rotators strength and throwing performance will be&#xD;
      explored.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At first, the reliability of the Xco endurance test will be assessed in sedentary adults.&#xD;
      Then, the reliability of the test will be assessed in overhead athletes. The experimentation&#xD;
      will include two sessions. During those sessions, the impact of fatigue (induced by the test)&#xD;
      on rotator cuff muscles strength and on functional test performance (Single Arm Medicine Ball&#xD;
      Throw) will be assessed. A time of 7 to 10 days will be provided between the two sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To perform the XCo endurance test, the participant will be seated on a chair, arm at 90° of&#xD;
      abduction (in frontal plane), elbow flexed at 90 degrees and positioned on a wooden support.&#xD;
      From a 90 degrees of abduction and a neutral position of rotation, the participants will be&#xD;
      asked to realise an external rotation movement of 90 degrees and then to go back to the&#xD;
      starting position as many times as possible at a speed of 140 bpm. Mechanical stops (the wall&#xD;
      and an adjustable height table) will be added to make sure that the participants respected&#xD;
      the entire range of motion. After adjusting the position, it will be asked to the&#xD;
      participants to perform 2 repetitions of 5 movements at 140 bpm (in eccentric and concentric)&#xD;
      to get familiar to the rhythm. Thirty seconds of rest will be provided between the 2&#xD;
      repetitions to avoid the appearance of fatigue before the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, the participants will begin the test. The objective of the test will be to perform the&#xD;
      movement as long as possible. The test will be stopped if the volunteers is not able to&#xD;
      maintain the rhythm or to do the movement anymore. The Modified Borg Scale will be used to be&#xD;
      sure that each subject was really exhausted when the test was stopped. For that purpose, each&#xD;
      of them will have to quantify their level of exhaustion on the scale (maximum score = 10)&#xD;
      every 30 seconds.&#xD;
