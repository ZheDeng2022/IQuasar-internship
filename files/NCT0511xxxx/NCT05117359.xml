      Despite improvements in available techniques and prostheses, the long-term evolution of&#xD;
      patients after transcatheter paravalvular leak closure remains poorly understood. The&#xD;
      objective of this study is to evaluate the long-term outcome of patients after transcatheter&#xD;
      paravalvular leak closure and to identify factors predictive of survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators designed a retrospective multicentre observational registry entitled FFPP&#xD;
      (e.g. &quot;Fermeture des Fuites Para-Prothétiques&quot; in French). Seventeen centres from France,&#xD;
      Poland, Turkey and Belgium enrolled retrospectively at least one PVLc procedure on aortic,&#xD;
      mitral, tricuspid or pulmonary valves without limit in its delay of performance.Follow-up of&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Paravalvular leak (PVL) of cardiac valve prostheses is a frequent complication after surgical&#xD;
      valve replacement. The incidence varies according to the type of prosthesis and location,&#xD;
      ranging from 2-15% for aortic prostheses and 7-17% for mitral prostheses, with an increasing&#xD;
      incidence over time. PVL may also be observed after percutaneous valve replacement. After&#xD;
      transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) the incidence of PVL at 1 year is 6%,&#xD;
      regardless of the type of prosthesis placed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority of these leaks do not lead to symptoms but they are sometimes responsible for&#xD;
      hemolytic anemia, heart failure and infectious endocarditis, thus posing an indication for&#xD;
      closure. The reference technique for PVL closure (PVLc) is redo cardiac surgery despite&#xD;
      significant morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Percutaneous PVLc techniques have been developed since 1992. Several small case series have&#xD;
      been published since then, highlighting the different closure techniques and the modalities&#xD;
      for evaluating PVL by 3D ultrasound and CT scan. Several multicenter registries have also&#xD;
      been published that trace current practices and also identify prognostic factors for success&#xD;
      in the short to medium term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, despite improvements in available techniques and prostheses, the long-term evolution&#xD;
      of patients after percutaneous PVLc remains poorly understood. The objective of this study is&#xD;
      to evaluate the long-term outcome of patients after percutaneous PVLc and to identify factors&#xD;
      predictive of survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators designed a retrospective multicentre observational registry entitled FFPP&#xD;
      (e.g. &quot;Fermeture des Fuites Para-Prothétiques&quot; in French). Seventeen centres from France,&#xD;
      Poland, Turkey and Belgium enrolled retrospectively at least one PVLc procedure on aortic,&#xD;
      mitral, tricuspid or pulmonary valves without limit in its delay of performance.Enrolment&#xD;
      started on January 1st, 2017. Study database was closed on december 31st, 2019. The study was&#xD;
      financially supported by Marie Lannelongue Hospital, without any financial support from the&#xD;
      industry. This research was conducted according to Declaration of Helsinki. The study&#xD;
      protocol was approved by an independent review board (CCTIRS, 6th January 2017, n°16-622). An&#xD;
      electronic case report form was created (easy-crf®). Each local investigator entered data&#xD;
      using a secure access. Data quality control was performed by Marie-Lannelongue research&#xD;
      assistants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Past medical history, cardiac surgery details, clinical, biological and echocardiographic&#xD;
      parameters were collected. EUROSCORE II risk scale (http://euroscore.org) was assessed with&#xD;
      the assumption that a surgical valve replacement would be performed. Both technical success&#xD;
      and clinical success were defined according to the Paravalvular Leak Academic Research&#xD;
      Consortium. Technical success was implantation of at least one device within the leak, with&#xD;
      an at least 1-grade decrease in the echocardiographic leak-severity grade, no valve&#xD;
      dysfunction, and no surgical conversion of the procedure. Clinical success was survival at&#xD;
      one month without re-admission for heart failure, blood transfusion, or open-heart valvular&#xD;
      surgery. The investigators distinguished per procedural complications, in-hospital&#xD;
      complications (index hospitalization) and complications occurring during follow-up.&#xD;
      Complication's severity was graded using a five levels scale.For each patient, the latest&#xD;
      follow-up data at the time of the inclusion period was collected. Follow-up of at least one&#xD;
      year was expected. New valvular surgery, new PVLc procedure, death and its causes were&#xD;
      collected through the patients themselves or their cardiologist by each local investigator.&#xD;

        An electronic case-report form (eCRF, Easy-crf.com) was completed for each patient. The&#xD;
        medical history (notably regarding heart surgery), symptoms, physical findings, laboratory&#xD;
        test results, and echocardiographic parameters were collected. The EUROSCORE II risk score&#xD;
        (http://euroscore.org) was determined, since surgical valve replacement was among the&#xD;
        treatment options. Creatinine clearance below 60 mL/min defined renal failure and below 30&#xD;
        mL/min severe renal failure. Heart failure was defined according to the European Society of&#xD;
        Cardiology as the presence of symptoms (dyspnoea, orthopnoea, asthenia) with physical signs&#xD;
        of heart failure (limb oedema, hepato-jugular reflux, crackles on pulmonary auscultation)&#xD;
        linked to the valvular disease. Anaemia was defined as haemoglobin &lt;13 g/dL in men and &lt;12&#xD;
        g/dL in women and haemolytic anaemia as anaemia with lactic dehydrogenase elevation and/or&#xD;
        schistocytes and/or low haptoglobin, in the absence of other causes of anaemia.&#xD;
