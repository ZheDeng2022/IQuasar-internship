  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to develop a therapeutic agent to help improve facial nerve&#xD;
      outcomes and ultimately improve long-term quality-of-life following surgical resection of&#xD;
      vestibular schwannomas. It is possible the therapeutic agent may impact tumor control rates&#xD;
      as well, and this will also be studied. Using rigorous scientific methods, we will assess&#xD;
      whether these factors are impacted by the treatment agent (Omega-3) versus placebo control&#xD;
      (cellulose).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vestibular schwannomas (VS) are common, often-benign intracranial neoplasms, however surgical&#xD;
      resection carries high risk of causing neurologic impairments that may severely impact&#xD;
      patient quality-of-life. The most morbid common postoperative deficit is facial weakness due&#xD;
      to the close anatomic proximity of VS with the facial nerve, which is frequently stretched&#xD;
      and attenuated by the tumor itself, and subject to additional mechanical stress during&#xD;
      surgery. In addition to disfiguring cosmesis, facial weakness carries the secondary effects&#xD;
      of abnormal speech, ocular morbidity from inadequate eye closure and corneal lubrication, and&#xD;
      dysfunctional swallowing mechanics. Some patients may eventually recover partial facial nerve&#xD;
      function; however, this is an unreliable process that proceeds slowly over months to years,&#xD;
      if at all. At present, no pharmacologic avenue exists for promoting facial nerve&#xD;
      neuroprotection or regeneration. Correspondingly, the development of a therapeutic agent to&#xD;
      stimulate improved facial nerve outcomes would markedly enhance patient outcomes and&#xD;
      quality-of-life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the anterior skull base, loss of olfaction is a common sequela of following endoscopic&#xD;
      surgical resection due to direct nerve manipulation, impacting approximately 25% of patients&#xD;
      who undergo endoscopic endonasal tumor resection. In a recent randomized clinical trial,&#xD;
      postoperative supplementation with omega-3 yielded a significant, sustained 1-2-point&#xD;
      improvements on the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test as assessed at six&#xD;
      weeks, three months, and six months post-operatively. Although mechanistic understanding of&#xD;
      the relationship between omega-3 supplementation and olfactory function preservation is&#xD;
      incompletely understood, preliminary data support the hypothesis of direct neural&#xD;
      regeneration and/or neuro-protective effects through anti-demyelination effects. More&#xD;
      specifically, polyunsaturated fatty acids have been shown to modulate neural plasticity and&#xD;
      provide a protective role in maintaining functional neuronal cell membranes thought to be&#xD;
      critical for maintaining nerve connectivity and function. It is also possible that omega-3, a&#xD;
      known anti-inflammatory agent through reducing local IL-6, TNF, NFkB, impacts the innate&#xD;
      immune system to mitigate demyelination and other destructive post-treatment inflammatory&#xD;
      injuries to cranial nerves and surrounding support cells. Given the highly interrelated&#xD;
      mechanisms-of-injury resulting in olfactory deficit after anterior skull base surgery and&#xD;
      facial weakness after VS resection, application of omega-3 fatty acids may provide similar&#xD;
      benefits with respect to facial nerve protection and/or rehabilitation. As a fascinating&#xD;
      aside, new pre-clinic animal model evidence also suggests that omega-3 fatty acid&#xD;
      supplementation may result in delayed progression in a neuroblastoma xenograft model. These&#xD;
      effects are attributed to anti-inflammatory and anti-angiogenic effects via anti-VEGF and&#xD;
      other anti-proliferative growth factors; factors also implicated in VS pathophysiology,&#xD;
      suggesting that omega-3 may also impact early tumor control as well. We hypothesize that&#xD;
      post-operative omega-3 supplementation will improve facial nerve function following resection&#xD;
      of vestibular schwannomas and enhance early tumor control rates.&#xD;
