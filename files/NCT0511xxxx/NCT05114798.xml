  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 42% of American adults are obese, and this condition is strongly related to the&#xD;
      development of colorectal cancer. Innovative lifestyle strategies to treat obesity and reduce&#xD;
      colorectal cancer risk are critically needed. This research will demonstrate that&#xD;
      time-restricted eating, a type of intermittent fasting, is an effective therapy to help obese&#xD;
      individuals reduce and control their body weight and prevent the development of colorectal&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 42% of the U.S. adult population is obese and data suggests that persons with&#xD;
      obesity are at a 30% greater risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC). Therefore,&#xD;
      efficacious approaches to preventing and treating obesity will have significant effects on&#xD;
      CRC incidence in the U.S. Although calorie restriction through lifestyle intervention is the&#xD;
      most common approach to treat obesity, clinically meaningful weight loss is difficult to&#xD;
      achieve via this method due to low adherence with calorie monitoring, indicating a need for&#xD;
      innovation. Time-restricted eating, a type of intermittent fasting, has been shown in animals&#xD;
      to impart cancer protective effects including lower body weight, decreased systemic&#xD;
      inflammation, and improved glucose metabolism. Time-restricted eating is where individuals&#xD;
      are asked to consume all their food for the day within a specified time frame, and water fast&#xD;
      for the remaining hours of the day. We recently performed two short-term (≤12-weeks) pilot&#xD;
      studies of time-restricted eating to evaluate its safety and preliminary efficacy on body&#xD;
      weight and chronic disease risk markers in adults with obesity. Our results show the&#xD;
      intervention is a safe and acceptable approach to weight loss among obese adults. Moreover,&#xD;
      time-restricted eating produced approximately 3% weight loss from baseline and reductions in&#xD;
      systolic blood pressure, oxidative stress and insulin resistance. Although these pilot&#xD;
      findings show promise for time-restricted eating as an effective tool for CRC risk reduction&#xD;
      among obese individuals, these data still require confirmation by a well powered longer-term&#xD;
      clinical trial. The present proposal aims to implement a 12-month (6-month intervention,&#xD;
      6-month maintenance) controlled, parallel arm trial among 255 obese adults (45-65 years old)&#xD;
      who are at elevated CRC risk and prediabetic (fasting glucose:100-125 mg/dL). Subjects will&#xD;
      be randomized to 1 of 3 groups: 1) 8-hour time-restricted eating (daily ad libitum food&#xD;
      intake from 11am - 7pm), 2) Calorie restriction (daily 25% calorie restriction), or 3)&#xD;
      Control (daily ad libitum food intake, no meal timing restrictions) to compare the effects&#xD;
      on: (1) Body weight, body composition, and intervention adherence; (2) Circulating metabolic,&#xD;
      inflammation, and oxidative stress-related biomarkers; (3) Colonic mucosal gene expression&#xD;
      profiles and mucosal inflammation, DNA damage and cellular growth; and (4) maintenance of&#xD;
      benefits on body weight/composition and CRC markers.&#xD;

    <description>During the active weight loss period, the TRE group will be instructed to eat ad libitum from 11:00am - 7:00pm daily and fast from 7:00pm - 11:00am. During the 8-h eating window, there will be no restrictions on types or quantities of foods consumed. During the fasting period, participants will be encouraged to drink plenty of water and may consume energy-free beverages, such as black tea or coffee. TRE subjects will meet with the TRE dietitian for 30 minutes at the start of the intervention to review instructions and goals, and then every week throughout the active weight loss period to review intervention adherence. At the beginning of the maintenance phase, total energy needs will be reassessed. Subjects will be instructed to main their body weight by consuming meals in an extended 10-h eating window every day and water fast between 8pm and 10 am, respectively.</description>

    <description>Cal-R subjects will be instructed to restrict energy intake by 25% of their baseline total energy expenditure (TEE) daily. Subjects will meet with a study dietitian for a 60-min one-on-one session to develop individualized weight loss meal plans to help them adhere to their calorie restriction goal. Meal plans will include portion sizes and food lists that are consistent with their food preferences and prescribed calorie levels for weight loss. Food scales will be provided to help with food portioning. Cal-R subjects will meet with the dietitian every week throughout the weight loss period to review intervention adherence and modify the meal plans as needed. Subjects will be asked to maintain their baseline level of physical activity. At the beginning of the weight maintenance phase, total energy needs will be reassessed. Subjects will be instructed to consume 100% of energy needs split between 3 meals every day.</description>
