    <textblock>
      Since 2009, adult patients with acute kindney injury (AKI) at the department of Nephrology,&#xD;
      Danderyd University Hospital and Karolinska Institutet, have been included in a prospective&#xD;
      cohort. All patients were treated and evaluated according to a detailed clinical memorandum,&#xD;
      and data collected prospectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By 2020, 1861 patiens have been included of which 1519 fulfill current AKI criteria (as&#xD;
      defined by KDIGO AKI guidelines) and will be evaluated regarding the following main research&#xD;
      questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Descriptive study on patient characteristics, changes in biomarkers and in-hospital&#xD;
           outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. One year outcome with focus on renal and cardiovascular outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Long-term outcome (up to 10 years) with focus on renal and cardiovascular outcomes.&#xD;

      Acure kidney injury (AKI) remains a complex clinical challenge associated with high risk for&#xD;
      short-term and long-term adverse events. Since 2009 patients with AKI at the department of&#xD;
      Nephrology, Danderyd University Hospital and Karolinska Institutet, have been included in a&#xD;
      prospective cohort. Adult patients with either s-creatinine &gt;130 micromol/L and previously&#xD;
      unknown level, or 30% increase from previous known level were included; patients on dialysis&#xD;
      were not included. All patients were treated and evaluated according to a detailed clinical&#xD;
      memorandum, and data collected prospectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By 2020, 1861 patiens have been included of which 1519 fulfill current AKI criteria and will&#xD;
      be evaluated regarding the following main research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Descriptive study on in-hospital outcome (death, renal recovery), patient&#xD;
           characteristics, hyperkalemia and changes in biomarkers reflecting inflammation,&#xD;
           acidosis and malnutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. One year outcome with focus on renal and cardiovascular outcomes (death, new dialysis,&#xD;
           worsened renal function, myocardial infarction, stroke, or heart failure; MARCE).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Long-term outcome (up to 10 years) with focus on renal and cardiovascular outcomes&#xD;
           (MARCE).&#xD;
