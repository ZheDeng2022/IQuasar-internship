    <textblock>
      The European guidelines currently recommend to use 2 L of polyethylene glycol and free&#xD;
      residue diet before any capsule endoscopy. However, up to now, no studies have been conducted&#xD;
      to specifically evaluate bowel preparation modalities before small bowel capsule endoscopy in&#xD;
      patients with Crohn's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with Crohn's disease and small bowel ulcers, polyethylene glycol may remove some&#xD;
      fibrin from these ulcers and alter bowel preparation. Moreover, it is important to select the&#xD;
      most acceptable bowel preparation because patients with Crohn's disease will have to repeat&#xD;
      capsule endoscopy several times after initiating treatment, for monitoring under treatment,&#xD;
      or for detection of post-operative recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a preliminary retrospective study, it has been suggested that a simplified bowel&#xD;
      preparation with liquid diet the evening before and water on the morning of the capsule&#xD;
      endoscopy induced a better bowel preparation than the standard method with polyethylene&#xD;
      glycol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the aim of the study is to demonstrate the superiority of this simplified bowel&#xD;
      preparation compared to the standard preparation modality in terms of quality of bowel&#xD;
      preparation, patient's acceptability and diagnostic yield.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease characterized by the presence of&#xD;
      ulcers that can affect the entire digestive tract, from the mouth to the anus. The existence&#xD;
      of small bowel lesions is pejorative and associated with poorer outcomes and a higher risk of&#xD;
      intestinal resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Small bowel capsule endoscopy allows the visualization of the entire small bowel in a&#xD;
      non-invasive and outpatient setting, without any anesthesia. It is the exam with the best&#xD;
      diagnostic yield for the detection of small bowel ulcers in patients with Crohn's disease.&#xD;
      Moreover, it allows the monitoring of patients after initiating treatment to assess mucosal&#xD;
      healing and the detection of post-operative recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As for any endoscopic examinations, its acceptability depends on bowel preparation&#xD;
      modalities. The European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) currently recommends to&#xD;
      use 2 L of polyethylene glycol and free residue diet before any capsule endoscopy. However,&#xD;
      patients with Crohn's disease were a minority (&lt; 1.5 %) in the studies on which these&#xD;
      guidelines are based on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Yet, in patients with small bowel Crohn's disease, polyethylene glycol may remove some fibrin&#xD;
      from the ulcers and hence, alter bowel preparation. Moreover, it is important to select the&#xD;
      most acceptable bowel preparation because patients with Crohn's disease will have to repeat&#xD;
      capsule endoscopy several times after initiating treatment, for monitoring under treatment,&#xD;
      or for detection of post-operative recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A preliminary retrospective study suggested that a simplified bowel preparation with liquid&#xD;
      diet the evening before and water on the morning of the capsule endoscopy induced a better&#xD;
      bowel preparation than the standard method with polyethylene glycol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the aim of CROHN-PREP study is to demonstrate the superiority of this simplified bowel&#xD;
      preparation compared to the standard preparation modality in terms of quality of bowel&#xD;
      preparation, patient's acceptability and diagnostic yield.&#xD;
