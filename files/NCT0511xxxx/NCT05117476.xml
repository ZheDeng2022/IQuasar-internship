             sample obtained after the most recent therapy. For patients in the expansion cohorts&#xD;
             for Module A and B a fresh biopsy is required if archival tissue (e.g., all tumor&#xD;
             blocks are exhausted) is unavailable. If a biopsy cannot be performed with acceptable&#xD;
             clinical risk in the judgment of the Investigator the Sponsor medical monitor must be&#xD;
             contacted to approve enrollment. If no archival tissue is available for patients&#xD;
