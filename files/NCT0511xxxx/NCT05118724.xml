    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that atezolizumab with or without IMM-101 will improve the prognosis of&#xD;
      patients with stage III dMMR CRC ineligible for or refusing oxaliplatin-based adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy compared to SOC and that these could therefore be promising therapeutic options.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current standard of care for adjuvant treatment of oxaliplatin-ineligible patients with&#xD;
      stage III dMMR colon cancer is fluoropyrimidine monotherapy. In the COLOPREDICT registry, the&#xD;
      3 years DFS rate for such patients &gt;70 years of age is 63% (95%CI: 53-75%). In contrast to&#xD;
      patients with mismatch repair proficient (pMMR) colon cancer, however, it is not established&#xD;
      whether patients with stage III dMMR colon cancer benefit from adjuvant fluoropyrimidine&#xD;
      monotherapy at all. For patients with stage II colon cancer in an otherwise identical&#xD;
      setting, there is no indication for adjuvant treatment due to a lack of clinical benefit&#xD;
      compared to surgery alone. Clinical results suggests a similar situation for stage III&#xD;
      malignancy. Similar to other checkpoint inhibitors (CPI), the PD-L1 antibody atezolizumab&#xD;
      demonstrated impressive activity and good tolerability in patients with metastatic dMMR CRC.&#xD;
      Recently, the randomized phase III Keynote-177 trial was presented. In Keynote-177, patients&#xD;
      with dMMR metastatic CRC were randomized to the PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab or to&#xD;
      chemotherapy (mFOLFOX6 or FOLFIRI with or without bevacizumab or cetuximab as per&#xD;
      Investigator's choice). Pembrolizumab treatment resulted in a statistically significant&#xD;
      prolongation of Progression-free survival . In addition, side effects were lower with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab and quality of life was improved compared to conventional chemotherapy. Thus,&#xD;
      pembrolizumab will become the new standard of care in patients with dMMR metastatic CRC in&#xD;
      first-line therapy.&#xD;
