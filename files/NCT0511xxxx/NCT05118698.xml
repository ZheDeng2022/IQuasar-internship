  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous research shows that gypenoside could keep blood lipid and blood sugar under control&#xD;
      in an effective way. In this study, we intend to explore whether gypenosides have clinical&#xD;
      improvement effects on metabolic diseases such as diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and non-alcoholic&#xD;
      fatty liver and their cardiovascular protective potential. It is designed to recruit 150&#xD;
      patients with metabolic syndrome diagnosed who meet the criteria for enrollment, and randomly&#xD;
      divide them into three groups. Gynostemma powder, with two different saponins content (12%&#xD;
      and 8%) from Pingli County, Shaanxi Province, and spinach powder with almost no saponins were&#xD;
      used to conduct the intervention on patients. Patients will be followed up regularly at the&#xD;
      beginning of each month from the first enrollment until the third month. At each follow-up,&#xD;
      data of patient's anthropometric indicators as well as clinical inspection indicators related&#xD;
      to metabolism (blood routine, liver function, etc.) will be recorded. In addition, patient's&#xD;
      blood, hair, urine, and stool samples will be collected to further explore the mechanism of&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;
