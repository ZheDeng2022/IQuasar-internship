  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to test the reliability of a novel procedure for measuring metabolic&#xD;
      flexibility, i.e., the ability to quickly adapt macronutrient oxidation to macronutrient&#xD;
      availability, in a respiratory chamber. The investigators will compare paired measurements of&#xD;
      metabolic flexibility determined 5-7 days apart in a metabolic chamber to assess reliability.&#xD;
      The investigators will also compare their novel method of measuring metabolic flexibility in&#xD;
      a respiratory chamber with a more convention method, metabolic flexibility during a&#xD;
      hyperinsulinemic clamp.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Metabolic flexibility (METFLEX) is the ability to adapt fuel oxidation to fuel availability&#xD;
      and energy demands. Impaired METFLEX is associated with weight gain, ectopic lipid&#xD;
      deposition, insulin resistance, and the potential development of type 2 diabetes. Even if&#xD;
      impaired METFLEX shows promise as an early predictor of future metabolic dysfunction,&#xD;
      longitudinal studies have been lacking because of the absence of simple methods for assessing&#xD;
      METFLEX. This project will further validate (reproducibility and comparison with&#xD;
      hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps) a novel approach for measuring METFLEX recently developed&#xD;
      by the PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METFLEX is commonly measured during a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. Yet, this technique&#xD;
      is questioned because it relies on a non-physiological stimulus (intravenous glucose and&#xD;
      insulin) and inherently suppresses fat oxidation via non physiological hyperinsulinemic&#xD;
      conditions. In contrast, impaired fat oxidation in response to a high-fat meal is a more&#xD;
      physiological indicator of metabolic inflexibility. The investigators have recently developed&#xD;
      a method for measuring METFLEX by assessing the dynamics in respiratory exchange ratio (RER)&#xD;
      in response to a high-fat standardized dinner in a whole-body room indirect calorimeter.&#xD;
      Securing extramural funding for the aforementioned longitudinal studies employing this novel&#xD;
      methodology is presently limited due to a lack of the following preliminary data: 1)&#xD;
      quantification of the intra-subject variability of this novel METFLEX measure to perform&#xD;
      power calculations (sample size) in large-scale prospective clinical trials, and 2)&#xD;
      comparison of our method to a more accepted measurement of METFLEX. The overarching goal of&#xD;
      this method development project is to generate reproducibility and validity data of The&#xD;
      investigators' new assessment of METFLEX in a whole-body room indirect calorimeter against&#xD;
      the METFLEX measured by a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp.&#xD;

    <measure>peak decrease in overnight respiratory exchange ratio</measure>
    <time_frame>12 hours</time_frame>
    <description>mean of peak decrease in respiratory exchange ratio (baseline values -nadir values) following the test meal during an overnight stay in a respiratory chamber.&#xD;
Peak values are defined as the lowest respiratory exchange ratio value measured during the sleep period, 11pm-5am&#xD;
Baseline values are measured 1h prior to meal (5:00-5:45pm)&#xD;
An increase in this value indicates increased metabolic flexibility.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>change in respiratory exchange ratio during high-dose insulin infusion</measure>
    <time_frame>4.5 hours</time_frame>
    <description>mean of peak increase in respiratory exchange ratio during a 80 mU/m^2/min insulin infusion (insulin stimulated - baseline values) that is conducted during an hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp procedure..&#xD;
Insulin-stimulated values are defined as the mean respiratory exchange ratio value measured during the final 30 min of a 2 hour 80 mU/m^2/min insulin infusion.&#xD;
Baseline values are measured 30 min prior to the start of the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp procedure.&#xD;
An increase in this value indicates increased metabolic flexibility.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>slope of respiratory exchange ratio</measure>
    <time_frame>12 hours</time_frame>
    <description>This value indicates the speed and magnitude of the participants change in respiratory exchange ratio between the peak and nadir values measured overnight in the respiratory chamber.&#xD;
A more negative value in this measurement indicates either a short time interval between the highest and lowest respiratory exchange ratio values measured and/or a large difference between the highest and lowest values of respiratory exchange ratio values measured.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>respiratory exchange ratio/food quotient (RER:FQ ratio)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The ratio of the 12-h respiratory exchange ratio to the food quotient of the meal.&#xD;
This measurement assesses the degree to which a participant's actual respiratory exchange ratio matches the theoretical respiratory exchange ratio that would be obtained if all the macronutrients in the test meal were oxidized during an overnight stay in a respiratory chamber.&#xD;
A value of 1 indicates perfect agreement between measured and theoretical values. A value greater than 1 indicates a lack of fat oxidation, while a value less than 1 indicates a lack of carbohydrate oxidation.&#xD;
Individuals with high metabolic flexibility should achieve values closer to 1 than individuals with low metabolic flexibility.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>change in respiratory exchange ratio during low-dose insulin infusion</measure>
    <time_frame>4.5 hours</time_frame>
    <description>mean of peak increase in respiratory exchange ratio during a 10 mU/m^2/min insulin infusion (insulin stimulated - baseline values) that is conducted during an hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp procedure..&#xD;
Insulin-stimulated values are defined as the mean respiratory exchange ratio value measured during the final 30 min of a 2 hour 10 mU/m^2/min insulin infusion.&#xD;
Baseline values are measured 30 min prior to the start of the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp procedure.&#xD;
An increase in this value indicates increased metabolic flexibility.</description>

    <description>Average time from meal to nadir respiratory exchange ratio value&#xD;
This measurement indicates how long on average it took form the onset of the meal, 6pm, for the participants to achieve their lowest/nadir respiratory exchange ratio value during an overnight stay in a respiratory chamber..</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to food quotient</measure>
    <time_frame>12 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Average time from meal to a participant's respiratory exchange ratio reaching the food quotient of the test meal&#xD;
This measurement indicates how long on average it takes form the onset of the meal, 6pm, for the participants to register a respiratory exchange ratio equal to the food quotient of the test meal during an overnight stay in a respiratory chamber.&#xD;
A reduction in this value indicates increased metabolic flexibility.</description>

    <intervention_name>Clamp Metabolic Flexibility</intervention_name>
    <description>Metabolic flexibility with be assessed during a 2-step hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp procedure. The clamp will be performed for four hours, two hours at an insulin dose of 10 mU/m^2/min and two hours at an insulin dose of 80 mU/m^2/min. Resting metabolic rate will be determined via hood indirect calorimetry at baseline, before insulin onset, and during the final 30 min of each step of the clamp. Metabolic flexibility will be determined by comparing the resting metabolic rate during baseline and during the final 30 min of each step of the clamp.</description>
