      Our study will discuss survival outcomes of multiple myeloma patients admitted on Assiut&#xD;
      clinical Hematology and role of neutrophil to lymphocyte and lymphocyte to monocyte ratios as&#xD;
      prognostic factors in multiple myeloma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      What are survival outcomes and the prognostic value of neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio of&#xD;
      multiple myeloma patients admitted on Assiut clinical Hematology unit? Multiple myeloma&#xD;
      (MM)is a plasma cell neoplasm associated with its characteristic clinical complications:&#xD;
      anemia, infections, renal impairment or bone destruction [1]. MM is the second most commonly&#xD;
      diagnosed hematological neoplasm, with an incidence rate of 6.2 per 100 000 individuals [2].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survival outcomes have remained constant over the past few decades; therefore, MM is still&#xD;
      considered incurable. However, the increasing use of autologous stem cell transplantation&#xD;
      (SCT) and the introduction of novel therapeutic agents, such as thalidomide and bortezomib,&#xD;
      have improved the survival of myeloma patients [3].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relationship between inflammation and cancer have been established.[4] Some inflammatory&#xD;
      factors from accessory cells in tumor milieu, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, and tumor&#xD;
      necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-Î±), facilitated cancer cells' invasiveness [5].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further studies exhibited that reactive oxygen and nitrogen from inflammatory cells induced&#xD;
      mutation of some tumor suppressor genes, and inflammatory factors such as IL-6 and&#xD;
      prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) caused DNA methylation, [6] which both played an important role in&#xD;
      tumorigenesis. Accordingly, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) [7] coinciding with&#xD;
      rationales supported by numerous studies, could offer a precise potency in predicting&#xD;
      prognosis of cancers. In fact, many studies already demonstrated the prognostic significance&#xD;
      of NLR in various cancers [8] Consistently, a number of meta-analyses further confirmed this&#xD;
      view in colorectal cancer,[9] lung cancer,[10] ovarian cancer,[11] breast cancer,[12] and&#xD;
      lymphoma [13] and others.&#xD;
