  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective is to demonstrate safety and efficacy of HIFU treatment of cutaneous&#xD;
      neurofibromas located close to the surface of the skin in patients with the genetic disease&#xD;
      Neurofibromatosis Type 1. The study will use a new investigational equipment that has been&#xD;
      specially developed for dermatological therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes 20 patients in total distributed between the two centers, each having a&#xD;
      minimum of 8 cutaneous neurofibromas eligible for treatment. All participants are adults&#xD;
      (over 18 years) of both sexes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The new treatment method is based on focusing intensive ultrasound just below the skin&#xD;
      surface. This creates a very fast localized heating in small and very well-defined volumes&#xD;
      containing neurofibroma tissue. This heating destroys or weakens the tissue, and the body's&#xD;
      natural processes will subsequently transport affected cells away through the lymphatic and&#xD;
      vascular systems. During the healing-process, the rejected tissue is replaced by new skin&#xD;
      cells that are not expected to be fibrous.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment is intended to be carried out without breaking the skin surface, and open&#xD;
      wounds are therefore avoided. This is an essential advantage of the method compared to all&#xD;
      existing therapies, which are based on physical removal of tumors through an open skin&#xD;
      surface (e.g. surgery or laser therapy). Complications with risk of pain, infection and&#xD;
      scarring will therefore be significantly reduced with the new proposed method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment is carried out by sending focused ultrasound from the handpiece of the&#xD;
      equipment into the target area with neurofibromas. The equipment is set to send doses of&#xD;
      approximately 150 milliseconds (0.15 seconds). The skin area and HIFU doses can be followed&#xD;
      on the system computer screen and will be placed side-by-side with approximately 1-2&#xD;
      millimeter spacing. To achieve good energy transfer from handpiece to skin, ordinary&#xD;
      ultrasound gel is used. There are no other special pre-treatments or preparations for the&#xD;
      process. HIFU treatment is expected to be less painful than other treatments used. The&#xD;
      treatment is quick, and typically takes less than 1 minute for a each area the size of a&#xD;
      typical neurofibroma.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The study is a multicenter (two-center) open-label study with high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) treatment of patients with the genetic disease Neurofibromatosis Type1.&#xD;
The study is not comparative or randomized. The investigation is performed prior to CE mark to confirm safety and performance of the System ONE-M device when used as intended, i.e. as an non-invasive method to remove cutaneous neurofibromas by 20 MHz high intensity focused ultrasound.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Short Term Safety Profile - Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The grade of any adverse events (AE) requiring medical intervention within three months of treatment should be low. Device-based treatment will be considered tolerable if less than 30% of participants treated have an &quot;Overall AE Score&quot; larger than Grade 2 AE at the 3-month follow-up (visit 4).&#xD;

    <measure>Long Term Safety Profile - Healing</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>The rate and nature of spontaneous healing of the treated cNF lesion and any safety related event including potential wound formation and wound healing should be equivalent to expectations from alternative method(s). Safety evaluation includes rating of treatment-associated sequele by end of study, e.g. dyspigmentation and scarring and overall investigator rating compared to expectations.&#xD;
