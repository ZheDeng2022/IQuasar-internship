  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of treatment combinations&#xD;
      in cancer immunotherapy (CIT)-naive participants with resectable Stage III melanoma (Cohort&#xD;
      1) and in participants with Stage IV melanoma (Cohort 2). The study is designed with the&#xD;
      flexibility to open new treatment arms as new treatments become available, close existing&#xD;
      treatment arms that demonstrate minimal clinical activity or unacceptable toxicity, and&#xD;
      modify the participant population.&#xD;
