  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of chronic bradycardia, one of the cardiovascular diseases, remains an&#xD;
      essential unsolved issue. The objective of this project is to speed up a new drug CARDIX-101&#xD;
      clinical Phase 1IA trial for the treatment of chronic bradycardia and to solve an unmet&#xD;
      medical need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there is no regulatory approved drug of this type available in the U.S or the world.&#xD;
      If the new drug CARDIX-101 demonstrated a significant positive effect on chronic bradycardia,&#xD;
      it should have a sizeable demand and solve an unmet medical need.&#xD;

      Following FDA and ICH Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidance, a clinical Phase I study titled&#xD;
      &quot;A Single Ascending Dose Clinical Study to Establish Safety and Tolerability of CARDIX-101 in&#xD;
      Bradycardia Patients&quot; was conducted at the University of California San Diego (UCSD) School&#xD;
      of Medicine, Cardiac Electrophysiology Center, and Altman Clinical and Translational Research&#xD;
      Institute and was completed in August 2020 under IND# 131775.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical Phase 1 study of CARDIX-101 was completed using eighteen patients with six&#xD;
      ascending single-dose levels. There were no adverse effects observed or reported for all&#xD;
      participating subjects related to the investigational medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A current clinical Phase IIA study, &quot;An Exploratory Safety and Efficacy Study of CARDIX-101&#xD;
      for the treatment of Chronic Bradycardia,&quot; is a multi-center clinical study. The current&#xD;
      clinical study is designed to utilize appropriate wearable monitoring devices for today's&#xD;
      Decentralized Clinical Trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will consist of a multi-site clinical exploratory study in chronic bradycardia&#xD;
      patients. The study is open-label, and enrollment of a cohort occurs without randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study investigates three dosage levels of CARDIX-101 (CARDIX-101A, CARDIX-101B, and&#xD;
      CARDIX-101C). The initial cohort will be enrolled in a staggered manner. In this way, it will&#xD;
      make the clinical study more accessible for the patient to participate.&#xD;

During the treatment period of 14±2-day, each patient is required to use near-real-time HR/ECG monitoring for a total of 14±2-day with no less than 16±6-hours of monitoring per day.</description>
