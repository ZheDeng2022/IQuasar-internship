  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diastasis rectus is the separation of the muscles along the midline of the abdomen, typically&#xD;
      as seen in women after pregnancy. Separation is mostly larger than 2cm width at above, below&#xD;
      or level of umbilicus. With this muscular pathology women do not feel any pain symptom just&#xD;
      perceiving symptoms of physical discomfort, abdomen muscle weakness and its bulging. Excess&#xD;
      weight of mother or baby and multiple birth pregnancy is the common risk factor for the DRA.&#xD;
      Various tools will be used for the diagnosis of DRA such as vernier caliper by using&#xD;
      centimeter ruler, diagnostic ultrasonography that give the exact measurement, pressure&#xD;
      biofeedback unit which is used to assess the strength of weak muscles, and patient specific&#xD;
      functional scale that used to determine the functional limitation and its improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To treat the DRA conservatively, Tupler's technique and conventional physical therapy will be&#xD;
      directed. Electrical muscular stimulations will also be given as a baseline before applying&#xD;
      both treatments. In Tupler's technique, diastasis rehab splint and Tupler's exercises will be&#xD;
      used whereas in conservative physical therapy, scarf tie around abdomen while performing&#xD;
      exercises, Respiratory rehabilitation manoeuvre and abdominal muscle exercises will be used.&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to find the the effects of Tupler's technique and conventional&#xD;
      physical therapy treatment for abdominal muscle strength regaining and in reducing the&#xD;
      diastasis recti among females with diastasis recti after their postpartum period. It is a&#xD;
      Randomized clinical trial and convenient random sampling is to be used with an inclusion&#xD;
      criterion of patients having age between 20-40 years, Both primiparous and multiparous women&#xD;
      and Diastasis recti more than 2.5cm within 6 weeks or more postpartum. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomly allocated into two groups, Group A will receive Tupler's technique and Group B will&#xD;
      receive conventional physical therapy intervention. Total duration of study will be six&#xD;
      months. Assessment will be done before and after the treatment. Pressure biofeedback unit,&#xD;
      vernier caliper, ultrasound and patient specific functional scale are to be used to measure&#xD;
      the outcomes. Data will be assessed by using parametric/non parametric test after completion&#xD;
      of study.&#xD;
