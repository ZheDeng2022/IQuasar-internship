    <textblock>
      Within the AGAVE project (2010-2014), funded by the 2008 AIFA (Italian Medicines Agency) Call&#xD;
      (contract No. FARM8YRYZC), a severe/uncontrolled asthma online Registry (RItA) was&#xD;
      implemented to assess the appropriateness of therapeutic strategies for severe/uncontrolled&#xD;
      asthma patients, according to GINA (Global Initiative for Asthma) guidelines, in&#xD;
      epidemiological and clinical samples. The online RItA Registry is a database containing&#xD;
      information on patients' general characteristics, medical history, clinical data, risk&#xD;
      factors, comorbidity, asthma exacerbations, current asthma treatment. Currently, it contains&#xD;
      information on severe/uncontrolled asthma subjects, enrolled at national level, performing&#xD;
      baseline (n tot=1018) and follow-up interviews (n tot=402).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the RISER study is to increase knowledge about the risk factors, diagnosis, and&#xD;
      management of severe/uncontrolled asthma in general population and clinical setting through&#xD;
      the update and follow-up of the RItA registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RISER study is an observational longitudinal study involving a clinical setting and an&#xD;
      epidemiological one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The field survey will comprise one or two follow-ups according to the sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Observational longitudinal study in hospital specialist centres (clinical sample).&#xD;
           Clinical cases of severe/uncontrolled asthma already included in the online RItA&#xD;
           Registry and new clinical cases of severe/uncontrolled asthma attending the clinical&#xD;
           centres and not yet included in the online RItA Registry, will be investigated at T0, T6&#xD;
           and T12 through a clinical form in order to collect information in accordance with the&#xD;
           online RItA registry, and routine clinical/functional tests of asthma control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Observational longitudinal study in a general population sample (epidemiological&#xD;
           sample). Epidemiological cases of severe/uncontrolled asthma from Pisa cohort already&#xD;
           inserted in the online RItA Registry and new epidemiological cases of&#xD;
           severe/uncontrolled asthma from pre-existing Pisa cohort not yet included in the online&#xD;
           RItA Registry will be investigated at T0 and T12 through a questionnaire to collect&#xD;
           information for feeding the online RItA registry. Subjects fitting the epidemiological&#xD;
           definition of severe/uncontrolled asthma will be invited at the Pisa clinical centre to&#xD;
           have routine clinical/functional tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data collected from clinical/epidemiological centres will be included in the RItA&#xD;
      registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, it is expected to enroll 422 patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      RISER study is an observational longitudinal study in epidemiological and clinical samples&#xD;
      investigated through questionnaires/clinical forms and routine clinical/functional&#xD;
      assessments at baseline and at follow-ups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is constituted by two arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. observational longitudinal study in hospital specialist centres (clinical sample);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. observational longitudinal study in a general population sample (epidemiological&#xD;
           sample).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical sample will provide a new characterization of severe/uncontrolled asthma&#xD;
      phenotypes through clinical and functional assessments and biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The epidemiological sample will allow to obtain new information about risk/protective factors&#xD;
      for severe/uncontrolled asthma and to identify new cases who have not been yet referred to&#xD;
      clinical centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RISER study is not a clinical trial, but it is an observational study without any specific&#xD;
      drug administration by the investigators. Participants will receive interventions, which can&#xD;
      include medical products, such as drugs or devices, or procedures, as part of their routine&#xD;
      medical care, but they will not be assigned to specific interventions by the investigator as&#xD;
      in a clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size Considering a possible loss to follow-up and a refusal rate of 20%, the expected&#xD;
      number of subjects in the clinical sample will be 287 (195 cases already included in the&#xD;
      online RItA Registry and 92 new uncontrolled/severe asthma cases not yet included in the&#xD;
      Registry).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering a possible loss to follow-up and a refusal rate of 30%, the expected number of&#xD;
      subjects in the epidemiological sample will be 135 (112 cases already included in the online&#xD;
      RItA Registry and 23 new uncontrolled/severe asthma cases not yet included in the Registry).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection tools:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinical form (clinical sample): a modified and updated version of the RItA Registry&#xD;
           implemented during the AGAVE study will be used;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Questionnaire (epidemiological sample): a modified and updated version of the&#xD;
           questionnaire implemented during the AGAVE study will be used. The questionnaire will be&#xD;
           structured according to the data required by the online RItA registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The clinical form and the questionnaire will take into account the following aspects, as&#xD;
           in the pre-existing RItA Registry: demographic characteristics, asthma severity and&#xD;
           level of control, current asthma therapy, comorbidities, risk factors, health services&#xD;
           utilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
           New information, to answer to new specific aspects addressed in the RISER study, will be&#xD;
           integrated: asthma indirect costs, quality of life, biological drugs use, reason of&#xD;
           changing therapy, use of electronic cigarettes or of heat-not-burn tobacco.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Routine clinical /functional tests of asthma control (clinical and epidemiological&#xD;
           sample):&#xD;
&#xD;
      serum total IgE, spirometry, reversibility test, blood cell count, fractional exhaled nitric&#xD;
      oxide (FeNO), oscillometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected from clinical and epidemiological centres will be included in the online RiTA&#xD;
      registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Field survey The field survey will be organized in three or two phases, according to the type&#xD;
      of sample. In particular, the field study will comprise T0, baseline, T6, follow-up at 6&#xD;
      months from baseline (only for the clinical sample), T12, follow-up at 12 months from&#xD;
      baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Observational longitudinal study in hospital specialist centres (clinical sample):&#xD;
           eligible subjects will be contacted from physicians, by telephone or directly when they&#xD;
           attend the clinical centre for control visits. Once the patients have provided their&#xD;
           signed informed consent, they will have to fill in the clinical form; routine&#xD;
           functional/clinical tests will be performed. In particular, subjects will be&#xD;
           investigated at T0, T6 and T12 through the clinical form in order to collect information&#xD;
           in accordance with the online RItA Registry and routine clinical/functional tests of&#xD;
           asthma control.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All the possible variations that could occur in the patients' disease status and disease&#xD;
           management, according to the routine medical care, will be registered and taken into&#xD;
           account in the RISER study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Observational longitudinal study in a general population sample (epidemiological&#xD;
           sample): eligible subjects will be contacted by telephone from trained personnel of the&#xD;
           Research Unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the signed informed consent is obtained by each enrolled subject, they will be invited&#xD;
      to answer the phone questionnaire and to perform a medical examination at the local clinical&#xD;
      centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular, subjects will be investigated at T0 and T12 through the questionnaire to&#xD;
      collect information for feeding the online RItA Registry. Subjects fitting the&#xD;
      epidemiological definition of severe/uncontrolled asthma will be invited at the Pisa clinical&#xD;
      centre (CC) to have routine clinical/functional tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject performing baseline clinical/functional tests at the Pisa clinical centre (CC)&#xD;
      will be clinically and functionally re-assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      . Statistical analysis: data quality control will be carried out before statistical analysis&#xD;
      performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive analysis will comprise: frequency distribution and Chi-square test for&#xD;
      categorical variables; analysis of variance and Wilcoxon's rank test for continuous&#xD;
      variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multivariable analysis will be carried out through logistic regression analysis and survival&#xD;
      analysis, taking into account the independent effects of potential confounders. Analyses to&#xD;
      assess asthma phenotypes/endotypes and presence of risk factors clusters will be performed&#xD;
      (i.e. cluster analysis, network analysis, principal component analysis) as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis on cross-sectional and longitudinal data will be carried out. The longitudinal&#xD;
      analysis will take into account a follow-up period of 6 and 12 months. For subjects already&#xD;
      included in the online RItA Registry, a longer follow-up will be assessed (from 5 to 9&#xD;
      years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparisons between the different phases of the study will permit to collect information&#xD;
      about changes in asthma condition; in particular, the following statistical analysis will be&#xD;
      carried out:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. assessment of incidence and prevalence of severe/uncontrolled asthma and related risk&#xD;
           factors in asthmatic cohorts;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. comparison between different therapeutic approaches and related effectiveness in terms&#xD;
           of asthma control, in the whole sample and taking into account comorbidity and&#xD;
           polypharmacy;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. assessment of possible risk factors for severe/uncontrolled asthma (i.e. demographic&#xD;
           characteristics, environmental/occupational exposure, comorbidity) related to a&#xD;
           different effectiveness of the therapeutic approach;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. assessment of treatable traits related to different effectiveness of the therapeutic&#xD;
           approach;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. assessment of severe/uncontrolled asthma average indirect costs, in the whole sample and&#xD;
           in specific subgroups of patients, in relation to gender, age, environmental exposures,&#xD;
           comorbidity;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. assessment of risk factors (i.e. demographic characteristics, environmental/occupational&#xD;
           exposure, comorbidity) related to different disease prognosis;&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. characterization of specialist clinical setting and epidemiological setting in terms of&#xD;
           risk factors exposure, therapeutic approaches and asthma control;&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. assessment of characteristics of new cases, enrolled from the epidemiological cohort and&#xD;
           clinically confirmed, who have not been yet referred to clinical centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical aspects: No issue about the safety of the protocol has to be forecasted, since all&#xD;
      the protocol procedures are routine analyses for severe/uncontrolled asthma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects will not undergo any risk for their physical or psychological domains, as they&#xD;
      will perform questionnaire interview and a regular medical examination under safe procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR 25 May 2018), informed consent for&#xD;
      data collection and analysis will be requested to the subjects involved in the study.&#xD;
