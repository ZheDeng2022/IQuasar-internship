  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate oral care provision in stroke care settings in Pakistan. Stroke can have&#xD;
      adverse effects on oral care and health. Little is known about current oral care practices in&#xD;
      stroke care settings.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For a variety of related reasons, stroke can adversely affect oral care. Physical impairment,&#xD;
      coordination, sensory or cognitive deficits may accompany a stroke and can impact on&#xD;
      independent oral care. Post-stroke alterations in facial muscle mass or movement and sensory&#xD;
      problems may result in poorly controlled dentures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dysphagia can contribute to oral care concerns in a number of ways. Oral intake of fluids may&#xD;
      be restricted to reduce the risk of aspiration pneumonia, which in turn can contribute to&#xD;
      xerostomia. Nutritional supplements, often prescribed, are high in sugar and may predispose&#xD;
      to caries. Furthermore, because of swallowing impairment, pharmacological interventions are&#xD;
      often administered in syrup consistency, which is sugar-based, and may also predispose to&#xD;
      caries. Reduced swallowing ability causes ineffective clearance of bacteria and debris from&#xD;
      the mouth leading to caries and infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some pharmacological interventions in stroke care are known to have oral side effects. Oxygen&#xD;
      therapy frequently administered in acute stroke management is known to cause mucosal drying&#xD;
      and blistering. The absence of normal chewing patterns as a result of pain, physical or&#xD;
      sensory impairment can also reduce salivary function. Xerostomia also causes pain, taste&#xD;
      disturbance, chewing, and swallowing difficulties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Speech and denture retention is also affected by inadequate saliva. This, in turn, increases&#xD;
      plaque formation, predisposes to opportunistic oral infections, periodontal disease, and&#xD;
      caries, conditions which place the individual at greater risk of pain, tooth loss and tooth&#xD;
      substance loss. Chronic periodontal infection is currently being tentatively linked with the&#xD;
      incidence of the stroke itself, while others have demonstrated a relationship with other&#xD;
      systemic diseases including pneumonia and cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthcare-led oral care is a complex intervention and comprises a number of elements. These&#xD;
      include assessment, accessing further assistance as required, and the use of appropriate&#xD;
      equipment and cleaning methods. Knowledge is also required to assess and apply oral care at&#xD;
      an individual level.&#xD;
