    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of Aquatic Therapeutic Exercise by providing a&#xD;
      set of exercises in the reduction and / or control the volume of secondary lymphedema&#xD;
      treatment of breast cancer in patients who are in the maintenance phase of conventional&#xD;
      treatment. It is an experimental, randomized, unifactorial, and intersubjective study. The&#xD;
      intervention group will be treated by guided underwater exercises while the control group&#xD;
      will receive the same set of exercises out-of-water. The research will be based on comparing&#xD;
      the difference on the volume of lymphedema obtained by the exercises provided aquatic&#xD;
      environment and out-of-water exercises. The study population will be obtained from&#xD;
      rehabilitation service Bellvitge Hospital. The goal is to evaluate the volume of lymphedema&#xD;
      and the quality of life related to the health of patients will be evaluated before starting&#xD;
      the treatment, at the end of the 20 sessions, when the treatment reaches 3 months and when&#xD;
      patient is discharged.&#xD;

      A randomized controlled experimental study has been carried out where two work groups were&#xD;
      compared, experimental N: 43 that carried out an exercise regimen designed in the aquatic&#xD;
      environment and control N: 47 that carried out the same regimen of exercises in a&#xD;
      physiotherapy room. Both groups did 20 treatment sessions of 45 minutes duration with a&#xD;
      frequency of 2 or 3 days per week. Lymphedema changes, quality of life and adherence to&#xD;
      treatment were evaluated. The evaluations were 3 days prior to the start of the program, at&#xD;
      the end of the 20 sessions, and at 3 months.&#xD;

    <description>We assessed changes in the volume of the affected limb over a specified period of time and possible long-term improvements. The independent variable studied was the effect of exercise in water compared with exercise out of water.&#xD;
The expectedoutcome (dependent variable) was a reduction or maintenance of the volume of the lymphedema-affected limb. A measuring tape was used to take serial circumferential measurements of both limbs17 using the following anatomical reference points on both sides.</description>
