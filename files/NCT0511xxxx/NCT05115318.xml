  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medical cannabis (MC) is a standard treatment in Israel to adults with resistant Gilles de la&#xD;
      Tourette syndrome (GTS). While small randomized control trials assessed THC efficacy on tics&#xD;
      and premonitory urge, only small retrospective studies assessed MC efficacy and tolerability&#xD;
      in GTS. Herein, By using an open-label, prospective design, our aim is to determine the&#xD;
      preferred method of use, efficacy and tolerability of 12 weeks of treatment with MC in adult&#xD;
      patients with GTS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gilles de la Tourette syndrome (GTS) is a childhood onset neuropsychiatric disorder&#xD;
      characterized by the presence of multiple motor and one or more phonic tics continuing for at&#xD;
      least one year. In Israel, although consumption of cannabis is outlawed, there is an option&#xD;
      to allow patients to consume the drug under supervision. Medical Cannabis (MC) consumed by&#xD;
      inhalation of smoked or vaporized dried female buds, or subligual oil extract of whole plant,&#xD;
      has been an approved treatment by the Ministry of Health (MOH) for resistant GTS since 2013.&#xD;
      Previous studies suggested that MC has a good effect on tics, quality of like and with good&#xD;
      tolerability among patients with resistant GTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current study, we prospectively followed-up patients eligible for MC according to MOH&#xD;
      restrictions, at our GTS clinic at the Tel-Aviv Sourasky Movement Disorders Unit (MDU). Each&#xD;
      subject signed a written informed consent before inclusion in the trial. Also, since driving&#xD;
      under the influence of cannabis is forbidden by the Israeli law, patients were instructed and&#xD;
      gave their oral commitment to avoid driving. The study was approved by the research ethics&#xD;
      (Helsinki) committee at our center. MC was consumed as oil extract, vaporized, or smoked&#xD;
      dried buds. The treating neurologist (S.A.) and patient together decided on the method of&#xD;
      consumption during the visit before initiating treatment. Patients were assessed 4 and&#xD;
      12-weeks following treatment initiation to gather data regarding treatment efficacy,&#xD;
      tolerability and SEs.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will be assessed before (baseline), 4 (visit 2) and 12 weeks (visit 3) after use of Medical cannabis via inhaled dried buds or sublingual oil extract. The percentage of THC and CBD were pre-set to 10% and 2%, respectively. All patients received the same general instructions for treatment titration, which was to start with 1 drop or puff a day and increase by 1 drop or puff as needed. There was no fixed schedule for the incremental increases, thus each patient freely raised the dose as well as number of daily consumptions until clinical benefit was achieved or SE emerged over a follow-up period of 12 weeks.</description>
