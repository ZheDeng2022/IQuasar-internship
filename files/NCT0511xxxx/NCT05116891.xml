             abnormality that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject's&#xD;

             metabolic dysfunction, or clinical laboratory abnormality that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, renders the subject unsuitable for participation in a clinical study due&#xD;
             to high safety risks and/or potential to affect interpretation of results of the&#xD;

             normal for any of the following electrolytes: potassium, magnesium, corrected or&#xD;
             ionised calcium.&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE: Subjects achieving normal values for these electrolytes with supplements during the&#xD;
        screening period are allowed at the discretion of the investigator. Serum chemistry&#xD;
        documenting normal electrolyte values is required prior to each dose of oxaliplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with congenital long QT syndrome or a history of ventricular arrhythmias,&#xD;
             including bradyarrhythmia (&lt;50 beats per minute).&#xD;

             to 4 weeks) post-infarction status, congestive heart failure, left ventricular&#xD;
             hypertrophy, cardiomyopathy, conduction disorder within 6 months before enrolment.&#xD;

             treated within 4 weeks of first dose of study treatment with potent DPD inhibitors&#xD;
             (eg, brivudine, sorivudine). Subjects who previously received 5-FU without toxicity&#xD;
             that can be correlated with DPD deficiency do not need to be tested&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with pernicious anaemia or other anaemias due to vitamin B12 deficiency that&#xD;
             cannot be corrected before the first dose of mFOLFOX.&#xD;
