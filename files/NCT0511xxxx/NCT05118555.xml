      The aim of this research protocol is to undertake evaluation of new and emerging MR&#xD;
      techniques in patients and healthy volunteers following software or hardware upgrades, as&#xD;
      well as for newly developed MR techniques; to establish their feasibility, image quality&#xD;
      and/or measurement repeatability/ reproducibility.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a 'master protocol', analogous to an umbrella trial design, that seeks to&#xD;
      evaluate multiple new MR techniques. As such, the study is designed to identify promising&#xD;
      techniques that merit further investigation. Following successful evaluation as part of this&#xD;
      study, new MR techniques will either be adopted into clinical practice or developed further&#xD;
      in a larger research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type 1) The new measurements are added to an existing patient examination, to allow&#xD;
      evaluation of the benefits of the new approach in comparison with standard procedures, in the&#xD;
      pathology of interest. This frequently is required during development of a new approach, when&#xD;
      measurements indicate shortcomings that can be corrected by modification of the sequence, or&#xD;
      in assessing a new software release from the manufacturer, which provides a range of new or&#xD;
      improved facilities, that must be assessed in relation to our established approach. In this&#xD;
      case patients undergoing established procedures or protocols will be measured with additional&#xD;
      sequences provided that the additional examinations do not add more than 15 minutes to the&#xD;
      total examination, that exposure is below or within the first level controlled MR safety&#xD;
      mode, and is not indicated to be likely to cause any adverse effects. No additional&#xD;
      intra-venous contrast agents will be administered (patients will receive intra-venous&#xD;
      contrast agent if indicated as part of their routine examination). These measurements will be&#xD;
      performed with verbal consent from the patient, which will be documented in the patient's&#xD;
      Electronic Patient Record (EPR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type 2) The measurements for evaluation or development of a new technique (usually in a&#xD;
      research setting) require a complete measurement or series of measurements to evaluate the&#xD;
      technique in appropriate pathology, often during the course of treatment. These measurements&#xD;
      will typically last for 30-60 minutes, the duration of standard MR examinations. In&#xD;
      exceptional circumstances these measurements will last up to 90 minutes. Measurements will be&#xD;
      conducted with the consent of the clinician responsible for the patient, which will be&#xD;
      documented in the patient's Electronic Patient Record (EPR). Measurements will be performed&#xD;
      with written informed consent from the patient. As this is a dedicated session for the&#xD;
      purpose of evaluating the new technique, this will require informed consent with a clear&#xD;
      indication of any potential adverse effects in the patient information sheet, even if such&#xD;
      measurement is performed during a routine clinically indicated or research examination. No&#xD;
      intra-venous contrast agents will be administered as a part of this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type 3) The measurements for evaluation or development of a new technique require&#xD;
      measurements in normal volunteers to establish the correct operation and value of the&#xD;
      technique, and in some cases to assess measurement repeatability or reproducibility. These&#xD;
      measurements will typically last for 30-60 minutes, the duration of standard MR examinations.&#xD;
      In exceptional circumstances these measurements will last up to 90 minutes. Measurements will&#xD;
      be performed with written informed consent from the volunteer. Any potential adverse effects&#xD;
      will be clearly indicated in the volunteer information sheet. No intra-venous contrast agents&#xD;
      will be administered.&#xD;

    <measure>Feasibility of a new MR technique</measure>
    <time_frame>10 years</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of feasibility is required at the earliest stages of development of a new MR technique. We will assess whether a new MR technique can be implemented on our MRI scanners with at least 60% success in achieving the desired measurement. 'Success' will be defined as: i. Acceptable quality of the MR image (or other MR data), assessed by a consultant radiologist or MR physicist, depending in the technique being investigated. ii. Acquisition time up to 15 minutes per sequence.</description>

    <time_frame>10 years</time_frame>
    <description>Repeatability or reproducibility will be assessed using two measurements separated by a short time interval using the same MRI scanner (repeatability) or a different MRI scanner (reproducibility). Bland-Altman plots will be used to assess repeatability / reproducibility and 95% limits of agreement (LoA) will be estimated.</description>

    <time_frame>10 years</time_frame>
    <description>Quantitative measurements from a new MR technique will be assessed in pre- and post treatment measurements, in order to assess the dynamic range of post-treatment changes relative to the repeatability of the measurement. These data will be used to assess whether further clinical studies are warranted for assessment of the new technique as a potential imaging biomarker. (The treatment is not part of this study, and will be standard-of-care. The timepoints will be defined relative to the standard-of-care pathway and will be fixed for all patients assessed per disease/MR technique.)</description>
