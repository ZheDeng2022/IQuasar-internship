    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, parallel-controlled phase I clinical study comparing the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, safety and immunogenicity of SCT510 with bevacizumab (Avastin®) in Chinese&#xD;
      healthy males.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eighty-four subjects randomly (1:1) received a 3 mg/kg dose of SCT510 or bevacizumab infusion&#xD;
      for 90 min and followed up for 99 days. The screening period of this study is 14 days.&#xD;
      Subjects will be admitted to the research center on day-1 and will be allowed to leave the&#xD;
      research center with relevant observation and evaluation on day 5 (96 hours) after the&#xD;
      completion of the administration. Subjects were asked to return for 10 follow-up visits&#xD;
      respectively according to this research protocol, on the day 8, day 15, day 22, day 29, day&#xD;
      43, day 57, day 64, day 71, day 85 and day 99.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects in each group will be blinded after blood/urine collection and safety&#xD;
      evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be tested by a validated LC/MS method for pharmacokinetic study.&#xD;
