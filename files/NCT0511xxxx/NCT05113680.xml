  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Emotional regulation (ER) appears today as a fundamental skill for the adaptation of an&#xD;
      individual to his environment. Indeed, functional and efficient ER is crucial for mental&#xD;
      well-being, but also for physical health, for the maintenance of satisfying social&#xD;
      relationships , and for work performance. Many research studies have shown that difficulties&#xD;
      with ER are central to the development of many mental disorders. Consequently, this skill can&#xD;
      be the target of psychological interventions , the effectiveness of which can be tested as&#xD;
      well as the mechanisms underlying that effectiveness. Various &quot;mechanisms of effectiveness&quot;&#xD;
      have been advanced in the literature. Of these, this project will specifically test cognitive&#xD;
      flexibility and feelings of self-efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although a growing number of interventions attempt to target emotional regulation, few are&#xD;
      evaluated in subclinical populations and few are protocolized. Similarly, there is little&#xD;
      research evaluating the effectiveness processes of these interventions. To date, two types of&#xD;
      interventions show particular promise: emotion competence based interventions and compassion&#xD;
      focused therapy. This research will therefore be based on the evaluation of two interventions&#xD;
      in a randomized controlled trial: Emotion Competence Training Program and Compassion Focused&#xD;
      Program that will take place over 12 two-hour sessions in a subclinical and clinical&#xD;
      population.&#xD;

    <measure>DERS Scale (Difficulty in Emotion regulation Scale,Gratz &amp; Roemer, 2004)</measure>
    <time_frame>1week</time_frame>
    <description>Difficulties in emotion regulation The DERS-SF is an 18-item self-report multidimensional scale of emotional regulation skills. The DERS examines six difficulties in emotion regulation: (1) unacceptance of negative emotions, (2) difficulty engaging in goal-directed behaviors in the presence of negative emotions, (3) difficulty controlling impulsive behavior in the presence of negative emotions, (4) limited access to emotion regulation strategies perceived as effective, (5) lack of emotional awareness, and (6) lack of understanding of one's emotions, defined as lack of emotional clarity. Items are scored on a five-point Likert scale. Lower scores indicate the presence of difficulties in emotion regulation.</description>

    <measure>DASS21 (Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale, Henry &amp; Crawford, 2005)</measure>
    <time_frame>1week</time_frame>
    <description>Stress, anxiety and depression The DASS-21 is a self-administered questionnaire that measures the severity of depression (e.g., I couldn't seem to feel anything positive), anxiety (e.g., I worried about situations in which I might panic and make a fool of myself), and stress (e.g., I had trouble calming down) during the past week. Each item is scored from 0 (did not apply to me at all in the past week) to 3 (applied to me very often or most of the time in the past week).</description>

    <measure>Well being scale (PWB; Ryff, 1995)</measure>
    <time_frame>1week</time_frame>
    <description>Well being The Psychological Well-Being Scale measures six sub-dimensions of well-being: self-acceptance (a positive attitude toward oneself and others), positive relationships with others (warm, trusting and satisfying relationships), autonomy (independence, ability to follow one's own norms, and resist social pressures), environmental mastery (competence in dealing with the demands of life), life purpose (sense of meaning, goals and direction), and self-fulfillment (openness to new experiences, view of oneself as developing and growing).&#xD;
We used the 18-item version (3 items per dimension) which is parsimonious and retains good psychometric properties (Ryff &amp; Keyes, 1995).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-compassion Short Form Scale (SCS-SF; Neff, 2003)</measure>
    <time_frame>1week</time_frame>
    <description>SCS-SF is a 12-item instrument with six subscales assessing elements of self-compassion (i.e., self-kindness, self-judgment, common humanity, isolation, mindfulness, and overidentification). Self-kindness refers to the tendency to extend kindness and understanding toward oneself when feeling emotional pain or stress. Self-judgment reflects the tendency to be self-critical, disapproving, and intolerant toward one's own flaws and difficult experiences. Common humanity is a capacity of recognition that feelings of inadequacy, emotional pain, and failure are universal human experiences. Isolation dimension measures feelings of loneliness, separation, and disconnection from others at times of failure or distress. Mindfulness refers to holding negative thoughts and emotions in balanced awareness, with an open and accepting stance toward difficult feelings and situations. Overidentification refers to the tendency to become excessively immersed or consumed by negative feelings.</description>

    <measure>PEC (Profile of Emotional Competence, Mikolajczak, Brasseur, &amp; Fantini-Hauwel, 2014)</measure>
    <time_frame>1week</time_frame>
    <description>Emotional competencies The Emotional Competence Scale is a multidimensional self-assessment scale. It assesses the five fundamental emotional competencies (identification, understanding, expression, regulation, and use of emotions) separately for one's own emotions and the emotions of others. This scale is composed of 50 items (Mikolajczak et al., 2014). The higher the scores, the higher the level of emotional competence.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>CFI (Cognitive Flexibility Inventory, Dennis &amp; Vander Wal, 2010)</measure>
    <time_frame>1week</time_frame>
    <description>Cognitive Flexibility The CFI is a 20-item self-report scale assessing three aspects of cognitive flexibility: (a) the tendency to perceive difficult situations as controllable, (b) the ability to perceive multiple alternative explanations for life occurrences and human behavior; and (c) the ability to generate multiple alternative solutions to difficult situations. These dimensions are assessed through two subscales: an Alternative scale and a Control scale. An overall flexibility score is calculated by adding the two subscales and reversing the scores on the control subscale. High total scores on this scale indicate greater cognitive flexibility during stressful situations; low scores indicate greater cognitive rigidity associated with less cognitive adaptability during stressful situations (Dennis &amp; Vander Wal, 2010).</description>

    <measure>ESE (Emotional Self Efficacy scale, Kirk et al., 2008)</measure>
    <time_frame>1week</time_frame>
    <description>Emotional Self Efficacy The Emotional Self Efficacy Scale (ESE; Kirk et al., 2008) is a Likert-type scale with 32 items, eight of which represent each of the four branches of Mayer et al.'s (2004) model. For each item, participants rate their confidence in performing that function on a 5-point scale in which a &quot;1&quot; indicates &quot;not at all&quot; and a &quot;5&quot; indicates &quot;very.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>QCA (Coste, Tarquinio, Rouquette, Montel, &amp; Pouchot, 2019)</measure>
    <time_frame>1week</time_frame>
    <description>Belief and expectation about therapy The questionnaire consists of six items (e.g. How much improvement in your symptoms do you think will occur). Four of the items are measured on a nine-point scale ranging from 1 (&quot;not at all&quot; or &quot;none&quot;) to 9 (&quot;very&quot;). Two of the items are measured on an 11-point scale ranging from 0% to 100%. The measure score is summed and ranges from 3 to 27. Higher scores indicate participants having higher credibility or expectation for improvement as a result of the treatment. This scale was completed by the participant during the first measurement time, before they started the interventions.</description>

    <measure>STTS-R (Oei &amp; Green, 2008)</measure>
    <time_frame>12week</time_frame>
    <description>Satisfaction about therapy and therapist This scale is composed of 13 items assessing three sub-dimensions: (1) the patient's level of satisfaction with the therapy (ST, e.g., I am satisfied with the quality of the therapy I received), (2) the patient's level of satisfaction with the therapist (SWT, e.g., the therapist listened to what I was trying to get across), and (3) overall improvement (e.g., how much did this treatment help with the specific problem that led you to the therapy? )</description>
