      Purpose: To investigate the impact of exercise load on resistance exercise-induced muscle&#xD;
      damage in untrained males and females.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: Unaccustomed resistance exercise can cause muscle damage, presenting as muscle&#xD;
      soreness and reduced muscle function - such as loss of strength, power, and flexibility - for&#xD;
      several days after the exercise bout. Therefore, individuals may require longer recovery&#xD;
      periods before performing another exercise bout, and their performance may be impaired.&#xD;
      Further, muscle soreness may reduce exercise compliance, particularly in novice individuals.&#xD;
      Over time, this may compromise the gains in muscle mass and strength achieved through&#xD;
      exercise training. Therefore, strategies to reduce the severity of exercise-induced muscle&#xD;
      damage and/or to enhance post-exercise recovery processes are advantageous for exercising&#xD;
      individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One such strategy is to perform resistance exercise with lighter loads, i.e. &lt;70% one&#xD;
      repetition maximum (1RM). Low-load resistance training has shown to induce comparable gains&#xD;
      in muscle mass and strength to high-load (â‰¥70% 1RM), while being perceptively less exerting.&#xD;
      Low-load resistance exercise may place less mechanical stress on muscle fibres and&#xD;
      accordingly, its impact on muscle damage has been investigated. While several studies have&#xD;
      reported less severe muscle damage, muscle soreness, and functional impairments with low-load&#xD;
      resistance exercise compared to high-load, others have found no differences. Further, there&#xD;
      is a lack of studies conducted solely in females or comparing between sexes. It has been&#xD;
      suggested that males and females respond differently to muscle damage, and therefore, this&#xD;
      research aims to provide a sex comparison in the muscle damage response to an acute bout of&#xD;
      resistance exercise performed with low or high loads.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, 40 healthy, young (18-35 years) adults (20 males, 20 females) will be recruited to&#xD;
      participate in this randomised controlled trial. Maximal leg strength and body composition&#xD;
      (by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry; DXA) will be conducted at baseline. In females, all&#xD;
      primary outcome measures will be obtained during the late follicular phase of the menstrual&#xD;
      cycle. Participants will then be randomised to a low-load (30% 1RM) or high-load (80% 1RM)&#xD;
      exercise condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three weeks later, participants will complete a resistance exercise session at their&#xD;
      allocated intensity on leg extension and leg curl machines to induce muscle damage. Various&#xD;
      measures of muscle damage (blood biomarkers, muscle soreness, flexibility, and swelling) will&#xD;
      be obtained before, immediately after, and 24, 48, 72, and 168 h after the exercise protocol.&#xD;
      The maximal strength test will be repeated 72 and 168 h after the exercise. Participants'&#xD;
      habitual activity and dietary intake will be monitored and controlled throughout the study&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcome: It is expected that the resistance exercise protocol will induce muscle&#xD;
      damage, which will be less severe in the low-load exercise condition. It cannot be&#xD;
      ascertained whether males and females will have the same responses to the exercise.&#xD;
