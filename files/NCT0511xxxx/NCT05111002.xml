  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this drug study is to find out whether the antibiotic lefamulin (trade name&#xD;
      Xenleta) will cure Mycoplasma genitalium infections that have not been cured by prior&#xD;
      antibiotics while finding out whether it is more effective if the antibiotic doxycycline is&#xD;
      taken first.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study participants will be randomly chosen to receive either lefamulin alone or doxycycline&#xD;
      followed by lefamulin in a 1:1 ratio. Each participant will receive 14 lefamulin pills or 14&#xD;
      doxycycline pills and 14 lefamulin pills in the mail and take them as directed for one week&#xD;
      (each). Participants will take one culture sample on the same day they take their first pill&#xD;
      and mail it to the laboratory. They will also answer questions about their symptoms, any side&#xD;
      effects, and their behavior with their sex partners. Participants will take samples two more&#xD;
      times and answer questions three more times if they are randomly chosen to receive lefamulin&#xD;
      alone or four more times if they are randomly chosen to receive doxycycline followed by&#xD;
      lefamulin during the study. The study team will culture M. genitalium then determine minimum&#xD;
      inhibitory concentrations (MICs) to three antibiotics (azithromycin, moxifloxacin, and&#xD;
      lefamulin) to see whether it is resistant to any of these antibiotics. The study team will&#xD;
      also test the test of cure samples to see whether the lefamulin cured the M. genitalium&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 20 patients have been enrolled, the study team will conduct an interim analysis to&#xD;
      assess futility. Futility will be defined as less than five percent probability that true&#xD;
      efficacy is greater than or equal to 60 percent (i.e., less than or equal to three of the&#xD;
      first 10 participants experience microbiologic cure). If neither lefamulin alone nor&#xD;
      doxycycline followed by lefamulin meets criteria for futility, the study team will continue&#xD;
      the study. If one regimen meets criteria for futility, the study team will drop the regimen&#xD;
      that met the criteria for futility and continue to administer the other regimen to the&#xD;
      remaining 20 participants. If both regimens meet criteria for futility, the study team will&#xD;
      halt the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be informed of their M. genitalium test of cure results. If the&#xD;
      lefamulin does not cure the infection, the study physician will consult with the referring&#xD;
      physician who will continue to treat the infection per clinic standard of care.&#xD;
