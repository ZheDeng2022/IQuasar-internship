  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to compare the efficacy, acceptability, and safety of vaginal estrogen&#xD;
      cream and platelet-rich plasma in pt. complaining of atrophic vaginitis.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oestrogen deficiency affects many organs such as the genitourinary system. Genitourinary&#xD;
      involvement causes untoward symptoms of atrophic vaginitis including dryness, burning,&#xD;
      dyspareunia, vulvar pruritus, and discharge For this reason, many investigations have been&#xD;
      performed to find out effective, safe, and acceptable therapeutic methods for atrophic&#xD;
      vaginitis. Although systemic administration of estrogen can improve the localized symptoms of&#xD;
      atrophic vaginitis, women are often reluctant to use systemic hormone replacement therapy and&#xD;
      prefer local administration of estrogen. Vaginal application of estrogen has been considered&#xD;
      an effective treatment of atrophic vaginitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effects of PRP treatment have been evaluated in many clinical conditions, including wound&#xD;
      healing, hair repair, skin regeneration [9], vulvar lichen sclerosis, stress urinary&#xD;
      incontinence, episiotomy scars, and lubrication aging in the vagina. It can take at least 12&#xD;
      weeks to determine the final effects of treatment with PRP Population of Study It includes&#xD;
      100 pt. complaining of atrophic vaginitis it will be divided into two groups, each group will&#xD;
      contain 50 pt&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology in detail:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients of the first group will receive vaginal estrogen cream one tube every night for 14&#xD;
      nights; then, one tube 2 nights in 1 week (two tubes every week) for 10 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second group will receive PRP injection every 3 weeks for 4 times. PRP will be&#xD;
      administered to the anterior vaginal wall using 27-G needles once every 3 weeks for 4 times&#xD;
      and PRP is mainly injected into the clitoris or the anterior wall of the vagina to increase&#xD;
      the tactile sensitivity of the injection site.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>improvement in Vaginal Health Index (VHI).</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Vaginal Health Index (VHI) will be assessed at weeks 0, 4, 8 and 12. VHI analyzes the following five components on a scale of 1 to 5: elasticity, fluid volume, pH, epithelial integrity, and moisture.A minimal total score of 5 points indicates severe VVA, and a maximal total score of 25 points indicates no clinical signs of VVA</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>improvement in Vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA) symptoms using the Visual analog scale (VAS).</measure>
    <time_frame>12 week</time_frame>
    <description>Vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA) will be assessed at weeks 0, 4, 8 and 12. Participants will report intensity of VVA symptoms using a 10-cm VAS. The scale's left extremity indicates the complete absence of symptoms (0) and the right extremity indicates the worst possible symptom (10). Participants rated VVA symptoms (dyspareunia, dryness, or burning) from 0 to 10.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of quality of sexual function using the validated Portuguese version of the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 week</time_frame>
    <description>The FSFI will be assessed at weeks 0,4 ,8 and 12 BY FSFI questionnaire addresses six different domains (desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, and pain/ discomfort) ranging from 0 (no sexual activity in the past 4 wk) or 1 (very dissatisfied) to 5 (very satisfied). Full scale scores ranging from 2.0 (severe dysfunction) to 36.0 (absence of dysfunction) will be used to evaluate sexual function throughout the study, with increased FSFI scores correlating to an improvement of symptoms. An optimal cut score of 26, reported by Wiegel etal, is currently used to differentiate between women with and without sexual dysfunction.</description>
