      Tuberculosis is still global burden disease at all the word and effect on quality life of&#xD;
      patients and affect on health authorities because the cost of medicine and health cost .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A total of 1.4 million people died from TB in 2019 (including 208 000 people with HIV).&#xD;
           Worldwide, TB is one of the top 10 causes of death and the leading cause from a single&#xD;
           infectious agent (above HIV/AIDS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In 2019, an estimated 10 million people fell ill with tuberculosis (TB) worldwide. 5.6&#xD;
           million men, 3.2 million women and 1.2 million children. TB is present in all countries&#xD;
           and age groups. But TB is curable and preventable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In 2019, 1.2 million children fell ill with TB globally. Child and adolescent TB is&#xD;
           often overlooked by health providers and can be difficult to diagnose and treat.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In 2019, the 30 high TB burden countries accounted for 87% of new TB cases. Eight&#xD;
           countries account for two thirds of the total, with India leading the count, followed by&#xD;
           Indonesia, China, the Philippines, Pakistan, Nigeria, Bangladesh and South Africa. (&#xD;
           WHO) All TB cases and 92.5% controls were zinc deficient. The odds of TB cases with&#xD;
           deficiencies of vitamin A and zinc was 2.3 (95% CI: 1.1 to 4.8) times more likely as&#xD;
           compared to the controls. More than 80% of all participants had below average fulfilment&#xD;
           of energy and vitamin A intakes. (7) Zinc is necessary for intact immune health and&#xD;
           defense against infection but there are common health problem deficiency at developing&#xD;
           countries and so zinc needs as supplement and the second problem zinc need helper for&#xD;
           transfer through plasma membrane so zinc ionophore is a best solution as this problem so&#xD;
           the investigators can use zinc ionophore as helper for zinc to enter the cells for&#xD;
           autophagy&#xD;

      M. tuberculosis -infected PMs, in vitro, elaborated IL-6 as the only major cytokine, which&#xD;
      was significantly inhibited by anti-TB drugs. Therefore, IL-6 can be developed as a potential&#xD;
      biomarker or biosignature to assess the success of the treatment of TB. (1) Tuberculosis is a&#xD;
      global health problem, and there is even an increase in cases of multidrug-resistant&#xD;
      tuberculosis in the world. Therefore, research is needed that can find new anti-tuberculosis&#xD;
      drugs (OAT) that are more effective for tuberculosis treatment. In this study, the effect of&#xD;
      (-)-epigallocatechin-gallate (EGCG) of tea leaves (Camellia sinensis) combined with the&#xD;
      first-line OAT will be observed, in order to find out whether EGCG has anti-tuberculosis&#xD;
      activity and can increase the potential of first-line OAT in-vitro. The anti-tuberculosis&#xD;
      activity of EGCG was determined by broth dilution method using Middlebrook 7H9 media at&#xD;
      concentration of 50, 100, 150, dan 200 ppm, then the potential of first-line OAT before and&#xD;
      after combined with the EGCG was observed. The results showed that the activity of EGCG at&#xD;
      concentration 50 ppm and 100 ppm could inhibit the Mycobacterium tuberculosis growth by 80%,&#xD;
      at concentration 150 ppm by 90%, and at concentration 200 ppm by 100%. First-line OAT&#xD;
      activity before combined with EGCG was ≥ 90% at 5 ppm rifampicin, 0.5 ppm isoniazid, 50 ppm&#xD;
      pyrazinamide, and 5 ppm ethambutol. Whereas after combined with EGCG, the potential of each&#xD;
      drug increased, marked by anti-tuberculosis activity achieved ≥ 90% at lower concentrations,&#xD;
      i.e. rifampicin 0.5 ppm, isoniazid 0.25 ppm, pyrazinamide 20 ppm, and ethambutol 2 ppm. These&#xD;
      results indicated that the potential of each first-line OAT increases after being combined&#xD;
      with EGCG, and EGCG has potentiation effect when combined with those drugs. In conclusion,&#xD;
      EGCG can increase the first-line OAT activity (2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The down-regulation of TACO gene expression by epigallocatechin-3-gallate was accompanied by&#xD;
      inhibition of mycobacterium survival within macrophages as assessed through flow cytometry&#xD;
      and colony counts. Based on these results, the investigators propose that&#xD;
      epigallocatechin-3-gallate may be of importance in the prevention of tuberculosis infection.&#xD;
      (3) The effectiveness of anti-tuberculosis treatment was improved during the first two months&#xD;
      by vitamin A and zinc supplementation,&quot; Dr. Clive E. West, a professor in the department of&#xD;
      nutrition at Wageningen University in the Netherlands, and colleagues write in the April&#xD;
      issue of the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2002;75:720-727). Previous research has&#xD;
      shown that TB patients often suffer from malnutrition, which can weaken immune response and&#xD;
      increase disease susceptibility. The addition of vitamin A and zinc has been observed to&#xD;
      boost the immune response in these patients. Patients who received the supplements were twice&#xD;
      as likely to have eliminated the TB bacteria from the mucus coughed up from their lungs by&#xD;
      two weeks than the group receiving only standard drug treatment, and maintained that&#xD;
      difference for seven weeks. These patients also had a greater reduction in abnormalities or&#xD;
      lesions on their chest x-rays than those not taking the supplements. Reducing the amount of&#xD;
      potentially contagious bacteria present in patients' sputum would cut the rate at which they&#xD;
      spread TB to others, the researchers noted. (4) The effect of green tea extract&#xD;
      supplementation on sputum smear conversion and weight changes in pulmonary TB patients: A&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial (5) Zinc is an essential micronutrient (34, 40-42), and its&#xD;
      tissue and plasma levels are influenced by dietary intake (38, 42). While severe zinc&#xD;
      deficiency is rare in the developed world, moderate zinc deficiency is widespread,&#xD;
      concentrated in elderly populations (42-45), and can be exacerbated in critically ill&#xD;
      patients (33, 46-49). the investigators demonstrate that both genetic MT deficiency and&#xD;
      dietary zinc deficiency potentiate lung injury in mechanically ventilated mice, consistent&#xD;
      with an essential role for the zinc/MT system in protecting the lung from injurious stretch.&#xD;
      To demonstrate clinical relevance of our findings, the investigators show that humans who go&#xD;
      on to develop ARDS exhibit lower plasma zinc levels. Taken together, our results suggest that&#xD;
      failure of essential stretch-adaptive responses, in this case associated with a remediable&#xD;
      dietary deficiency among hospitalized patients, may play an important role in injury&#xD;
      responses propagated by MV. (6)&#xD;
