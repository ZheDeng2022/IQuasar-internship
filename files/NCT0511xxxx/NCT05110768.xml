  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose is to determine whether FPC, administered via infusion, is safe and&#xD;
      effective for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in patients receiving Home&#xD;
      Infusion therapies (HI).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-center, clinical trial of the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of FPC infusion for patients diagnosed with IDA receiving therapy home&#xD;
      infusion therapy. The study will be open label placebo-controlled using an objective endpoint&#xD;
      (Hgb). A total of 75 home infusion patients will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized to receive FPC starting at Day 1; Patients in the FPC arm will&#xD;
      receive FPC 20 mg Fe IV by infusion over 12 hours every other day (qOD), for a total duration&#xD;
      of up to 12 weeks plus a one-week follow-up after the last study drug treatment. For patients&#xD;
      whose duration of therapy is &gt;10 hours, patients will receive a 12-hour infusion of FPC.&#xD;
      Patients in the placebo arms will receive IV placebo on the same schedule for 12 weeks.&#xD;
