  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stabilization exercises help increase strength, stability, balance, gait, and endurance&#xD;
      through effective abdominal training. Bridge exercise, which is one of the closed kinetic&#xD;
      exercises, is one of the most used spinal stabilization exercises. Although that exercise&#xD;
      affects on the trunk muscles, it has been stated that it is related to all muscles of the&#xD;
      lower extremity.There are some studies, which are examining the activation of the gluteus&#xD;
      maximus, quadriceps, rectus abdominus, iliocostalis lumborum, iliocostalis thoracis, and&#xD;
      gastrocnemius muscles while exercising the bridge. Although there are some studies&#xD;
      investigating the activation of muscles at different knee angles, there is no study in the&#xD;
      literature examining the effect of bridge exercise performed at different knee angles on the&#xD;
      strength and endurance of lower extremity and trunk muscles. For these reasons, this study&#xD;
      aimed to examine the effect of bridging exercises performed at different knee angles on&#xD;
      muscle strength and endurance in healthy subjects.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Participants included in the study will randomly divide into 3 different groups by using&#xD;
      simple sealed envelope randomization method. Participants in the first group will perform&#xD;
      exercise at knee angle was 45⁰ flexion, the participants in the second group will perform to&#xD;
      exercise at knee angle 60⁰ flexion and the participants in the third group will perform&#xD;
      exercise knee angle at 90⁰ flexion. All participants will include in a bridging exercise&#xD;
      program by a blind researcher at predetermined knee angles (45⁰, 60⁰ 90⁰), 3 sets of 15&#xD;
      repetitions per day, 3 days a week for 6 weeks. Evaluations will be done by a blinded&#xD;
      researcher 1 week before starting the 6-week exercise program and 1 week after they finished&#xD;
      the program. All evaluations will be made by the same physiotherapist by meeting with&#xD;
      participants face to face. Inclusion in the research will be on a voluntary basis. As outcome&#xD;
      measures, muscle strength assessment and core Endurance Assessment will be evaluated.&#xD;
