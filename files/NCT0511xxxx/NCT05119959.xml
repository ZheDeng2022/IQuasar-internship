  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children exposed to HIV in-utero but uninfected (CHEUs) number 14.8 million globally. In&#xD;
      Zambia, an estimated 56,000 CHEUs are born annually, a staggering fraction of the national&#xD;
      birth cohort. Multiple studies establish that CHEUs are more neurodevelopmentally vulnerable&#xD;
      than HIV-unexposed peers. In Zambia, there are existing effective early childhood&#xD;
      developmental (ECD) interventions that target other vulnerable populations, but never trialed&#xD;
      specifically for CHEUs. Scaling up ECD is now a priority of Zambia's national strategy, but&#xD;
      CHEUs are not currently targeted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a need to better understand the scope and mechanism of CHEU-related&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental differences and what interventions are most effective. This randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial (RCT) is a true effectiveness trial as the intervention will deploy a&#xD;
      home-based adaptation of the same curriculum that is currently used elsewhere in the country,&#xD;
      named Scaling Up Early Childhood Development In Zambia (SUPERCDZ). The effectiveness of a&#xD;
      scalable early childhood development (ECD) intervention for CHEUs will be evaluated using&#xD;
      normalized Z-scores of neurodevelopmental testing at age 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this RCT the investigators will test the following hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: An ECD intervention delivered by community health workers via bi-weekly home&#xD;
      visits will improve neurodevelopmental outcomes in CHEUs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: CHEUs have significantly worse neurodevelopmental outcomes than unexposed peers&#xD;
      at 24 months, mediated by preterm birth, disease stage or antiretroviral (ARV) exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This RCT will build on an existent, actively recruiting cohort of 1500 pregnant women-infant&#xD;
      dyads in a peri-urban hospital in Zambia, the Zambian Infant Cohort Study (ZICS), by&#xD;
      extending the follow-up of a subsample of infants from 6 months to 2 years amongst the last&#xD;
      525 children enrolled (ZICS-BOOST- Brains Optimized to Survive and Thrive). The study will&#xD;
      have three arms: Arm 1) CHEU + ECD intervention (n=175); Arm 2) CHEU without ECD intervention&#xD;
      (n=175); Arm 3) HUU without intervention (n=175).&#xD;

    <description>The Malawi Developmental Assessment Tool (MDAT) will be used to assess neurodevelopment. MDAT provides an independent evaluation of development in the domains of gross motor, fine motor, language and social skills. The MDAT can be administered in any environment as it requires minimal equipment and is more culturally relevant to our context. The scores from the MDAT are relatable and comparable to those obtained from the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development 3rd Edition (BSID-III). Primary outcomes will be z-scores from four neurodevelopmental domain measurements-gross motor, fine motor, language, and social.</description>

    <description>The Caregiver Reported Early Development Instrument (CREDI) will be used to assess age-specific tasks for early childhood 0-36 months. It is intended to be used at a population level to detect developmental delay, not as an individual diagnostic tool. This open-source, psychometrically sound tool has been tested in over 15 low-and-middle-income countries and is culturally and linguistically neutral. When deployed in its long form it can be analyzed by specific developmental domains including (motor, language and cognitive, socio-emotional). CREDI scores per arm will be described in z-scores from four neurodevelopmental domain measurements.</description>
