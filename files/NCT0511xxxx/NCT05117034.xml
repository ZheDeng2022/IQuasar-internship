    <textblock>
      We propose a double-blind randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of intravenously&#xD;
      administered morphine at surgery conclusion on acute postoperative pain in patients&#xD;
      recovering from craniotomy surgery. Participating adults having craniotomy surgery will be&#xD;
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to intraoperative intravenous administration of 0.08 mg/kg morphine&#xD;
      at dura closure, or a matching placebo.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      After confirming eligibility, patients will be approached by one of the study researchers for&#xD;
      potential participation. After a thorough explanation, written informed consent will be&#xD;
      obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General anesthesia will be induced with propofol (2-3 mg/kg), and either remifentanil (1&#xD;
      mcg/kg) or fentanyl (2 mcg/kg). Lidocaine (1 mg/kg) and rocuronium (0.6 mg/kg) will be&#xD;
      allowed and left to the discretion of the caregivers. Anesthesia will be maintained with&#xD;
      infusions of propofol and remifentanil, and titrated to maintain hemodynamic goals and&#xD;
      evaluation of anesthesia depth by somatosensory or motor evoked potentials according to&#xD;
      clinical requirements. Ketamine and fentanyl administration will not be allowed at the&#xD;
      maintenance phase. No additional IV opioids will be allowed during surgery. Other analgesics&#xD;
      such as dipyrone and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (such as diclofenac) will not be&#xD;
      allowed during surgery or during PACU stay. At dura closure, patients will be randomized by a&#xD;
      web-based randomization service in a 1:1 ratio. The intervention group will receive 0.08&#xD;
      mg/kg intravenous morphine (0.08 ml/kg), while the control group will receive 0.08 ml/kg 0.9%&#xD;
      NaCl. The research solution (morphine/0.9% NaCl) will be administered via IV infusion over&#xD;
      ten minutes. Randomization and study drug preparation will be performed by a research&#xD;
      team-member, uninvolved in data collection, analysis, or patient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will receive acetaminophen (1 gr) at dura closure. Steroids and other anti-emetic&#xD;
      medications will be allowed. Remifentanyl and propofol infusions will be discontinued at the&#xD;
      end of the surgery during wound dressing. All patients will have orders for intravenous&#xD;
      morphine administration in PACU for breakthrough pain as acceptable and according to the&#xD;
      orders prescribed by anesthesiologist assigned for the case/the attending anesthesiologist in&#xD;
      PACU. The research team/protocol does not interfere with morphine administration during PACU&#xD;
      stay. All caregivers will be blinded to treatment allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient's monitoring at the operating room and during transportation to the PACU will be done&#xD;
      by the anesthesiologist assigned for the case. Patient's monitoring during PACU stay will be&#xD;
      done by the PACU team and according to the patient's clinical status according to PACU&#xD;
      protocol. Patients will be followed during PACU stay by a study team member blinded to the&#xD;
      treatment allocation. The study team member will measure and record pain score (NRS),&#xD;
      sedation score (Ramsay score) and PONV at admission to PACU and 30 minutes after admission to&#xD;
      PACU. The research team, according the research hypothesis is interested in measuring pain&#xD;
      (via NRS) while the patient is fully conscious and alert. Additional data regarding the&#xD;
      surgery, anesthesia, recovering from anesthesia and PACU stay will be collected retroactively&#xD;
      from computer system data (metavision, chameleon).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic and clinical data will be collected on the day of surgery. Surgical and&#xD;
      anesthetic data, laboratory results, details regarding side effects, time of first morphine&#xD;
      requirement, total morphine consumption in PACU, and pain scores (NRS) at POD1 and POD2 will&#xD;
      be collected from computerized patient files.&#xD;
