    <textblock>
      Observational study in two medical-surgical intensive care units of the Clermont-Ferrand&#xD;
      University Hospital to develop a composite score for prediction of 72h-extubation failure in&#xD;
      patients at risk of extubation failure.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In our intensive care units, when a patient does not have risk factors for extubation&#xD;
      failure, SBT (Spontaneous Breathing Trial) in PSV (Pressure Support Ventilation) is usually&#xD;
      performed first as recommended. If patient fails the first SBT in PSV or extubation, weaning&#xD;
      is considered difficult (WIND study group AJRCCM 2017). In this case, the service protocol&#xD;
      provides a T-piece SBT for the following SBT. In addition, this same protocol proposes to&#xD;
      perform T-piece SBT from the first weaning event in patients with risk factors for WiPO&#xD;
      (Weaning-induced Pulmonary Oedema), defined as obesity (BMI &gt;30 kg/m2), COPD (Chronic&#xD;
      Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) (suspected or known), or heart disease (structural&#xD;
      [hypertrophic, dilated, valvular], functional [diastolic or systolic dysfunction], ischemic,&#xD;
      or dysrhythmic).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study population concerns patients for whom a T-piece trial is performed according to the&#xD;
      service protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A patient is potentially includible in the study if he has been under mechanical ventilation&#xD;
      for at least 48h and if he presents criteria of weanability with a planned T-piece SBT. As&#xD;
      long as the inclusion and non-inclusion criteria are respected (see inclusion/non-inclusion&#xD;
      criteria), clinical, biological and ultrasound data will be collected before and at the end&#xD;
      of the ventilatory weaning test. If the patient fails the weaning test and/or is not&#xD;
      extubated following the test, data from each new T-piece SBT will be collected within 7 days&#xD;
      of inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The global management of the patient, before, during and after the inclusion of the patient&#xD;
      in the study is the one usually practiced in our intensive care units, based on the national&#xD;
      and international recommendations as well as the literature exposed in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the patient's stay in the ICU, data from the medical record will be collected&#xD;
      (demographic, clinical, treatment, vital status,...). A follow-up at D7, D28 and D90 will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
