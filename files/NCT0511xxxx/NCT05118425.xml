  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The influences of diet on psoriasis have been long discussed. As reported in previous&#xD;
      publications, a majority of U.S. psoriasis population show high interest in the role of diet&#xD;
      on their skin conditions. Given the distinct traditional perceptions and lifestyles in China,&#xD;
      the dietary beliefs and behaviors in Chinese psoriasis patients would be very likely to show&#xD;
      different patterns. Nevertheless, the information of this large population is still unknown.&#xD;
      In this regard, the investigators conduct a questionnaire-based survey, aiming to assess the&#xD;
      dietary perceptions and behaviors of Chinese psoriasis patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A total of 25 medical institutions all over China participated in the survey. Psoriasis&#xD;
      patients surveyed were from both outpatient and inpatient dermatology departments.&#xD;
      Researchers from each institution were trained for assisting patients to fill the&#xD;
      questionnaire. Each participant filled the online-based questionnaire anonymously in a&#xD;
      private setting. The questionnaire consisted of 54 main questions and extended questions,&#xD;
      concerning the profile of disease conditions, perceptions and behaviors of diet in their&#xD;
      daily life.&#xD;
