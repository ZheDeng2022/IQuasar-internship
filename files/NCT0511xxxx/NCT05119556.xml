    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of a real time video&#xD;
      telehealth pulmonary rehabilitation intervention with standard of care in patients&#xD;
      hospitalized for an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) to determine&#xD;
      the impact on hospital readmissions and respiratory morbidity, and to investigate the&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of the intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 52 week, prospective, randomized controlled, phase 3, multi-center clinical trial&#xD;
      (n=768 at 10 clinical sites) comparing the efficacy and safety of a real time video&#xD;
      telehealth pulmonary rehabilitation intervention with standard of care in patients&#xD;
      hospitalized for COPD exacerbation to determine the impact on hospital readmissions and&#xD;
      respiratory morbidity, and to investigate the cost-effectiveness of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients with a clinical diagnosis of COPD who are hospitalized for an acute exacerbation&#xD;
      of COPD at each clinical site will be considered for inclusion. Interested participants will&#xD;
      be seen at 7 (-2 to +3) days after discharge from the hospital. At this visit, participants&#xD;
      will be randomized 1:1, in varying blocks, stratified by site, to video telehealth PR plus&#xD;
      standard of care versus standard of care alone. The telehealth intervention will involve 3&#xD;
      exercise sessions a week for 12 weeks. Exercise sessions will be provided in real-time via&#xD;
      live two-way videoconferencing using a HIPAA-compliant app on an encrypted smart phone or&#xD;
      similar device. Each session will be standardized to include cardiovascular (aerobic)&#xD;
      training, strength (resistance) training, breathing exercises, and education that includes&#xD;
      smoking cessation counselling where applicable, inhaler use techniques, diet, and nutrition.&#xD;
      Participants in both the intervention and control arms will receive standard of care per&#xD;
      local guidance. The control arm will receive additional weekly phone calls to ascertain any&#xD;
      exacerbations. Questionnaires and assessments of function will be administered at the&#xD;
      baseline 7 day visit and at completion of the intervention at 13 weeks. Participants in both&#xD;
      arms will be contacted 4-weekly throughout the intervention period to ascertain healthcare&#xD;
      utilization. Questionnaires and assessments of function will be repeated at the end of the&#xD;
      follow-up period at 52 weeks.&#xD;

A total of 36 sessions will be administered over 13 weeks post-discharge. Sessions will be administered by exercise physiologists located at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Each session will be scheduled with up to three other participants at a time to mimic group sessions as delivered at center-based pulmonary rehabilitation programs. Exercise sessions will include aerobics, strength or resistance training, breathing exercises, and education sessions. The exercise plans will be tailored according to the participants' baseline exercise tolerance as determined by an initial six minute walk test and their answers to the questionnaires at the baseline visit.</description>

    <ipd_description>De-identified data will be shared through a password-protected website maintained without cost to researchers after requests are vetted by the principal investigators at UAB. The investigators will make the data and associated documentation available to users under a data sharing agreement that accounts for: (1) a commitment to using the data only for research purposes and not to identify any individual participant; (2) a commitment to securing the data using appropriate computer technology; and (3) a commitment to destroying or returning the data after analyses are completed. Users must also agree to the conditions of use governing access to the public release of data, reporting responsibilities, restrictions on redistribution of the data to third parties, and proper acknowledgement of the data resource. Research data will be de-identified to prevent disclosure of personal identifiers and presented in a summary format.</ipd_description>
