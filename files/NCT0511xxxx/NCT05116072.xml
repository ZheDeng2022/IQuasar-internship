    <textblock>
      Curative management of locally resectable invasive adenocarcinomas located in the cephalic&#xD;
      region of the pancreas (pancreas, duodenum and ampulla of Vater) requires a&#xD;
      pancreaticoduodenectomy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. Pancreaticoduodenectomy is a major&#xD;
      surgery that often leads to major complications including approximately 20% of relevant&#xD;
      clinical postoperative pancreatic fistula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative complications following pancreaticoduodenectomy can lead to early&#xD;
      discontinuation of the complete oncologic strategy, i.e., chemotherapy for malignancy is&#xD;
      performed in only about a third of patients who experienced a grade C fistula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total pancreatectomy rather than a pancreaticoduodenectomy is an alternative procedure that&#xD;
      involves the complete and definitive resection of all pancreatic tissue, eliminating any risk&#xD;
      of postoperative pancreatic fistula but is associated with unavoidable endocrine&#xD;
      insufficiency and potentially severe metabolic complications, such as &quot;brittle diabetes&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total Pancreatectomy following by intraportal Islet AutoTransplantation (TPIAT) can prevent&#xD;
      &quot;brittle diabetes&quot; and improve the quality of life. The endocrine islets can be isolated from&#xD;
      the pancreatic surgical specimen with standardized procedures and transplanted in the liver&#xD;
      through intraportal infusion, in absence of immunosuppression and allow adequate control of&#xD;
      glucose metabolism with a reduced need for exogenous insulin and an effective graft function&#xD;
      in 70% of cases at 3 years Thereby, the investigators hypothesize that total pancreatectomy&#xD;
      with intraportal Islet autotransplantation rather than classical pancreaticuduodenectomy, in&#xD;
      patients with high-risk of postoperative fistula will increase the rate of complete access to&#xD;
      adjuvant chemotherapy, while maintaining an adequate metabolic control.&#xD;

      Curative management of locally resectable invasive adenocarcinomas located in the cephalic&#xD;
      region of the pancreas (pancreas, duodenum and ampulla of Vater) requires a&#xD;
      pancreaticoduodenectomy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. Pancreaticoduodenectomy is a major&#xD;
      surgery that often leads to major complications including approximately 20% of relevant&#xD;
      clinical postoperative pancreatic fistula. Severe postoperative pancreatic fistulas (grade C)&#xD;
      require reoperation or lead to organ failure and/or mortality. In an extensive international&#xD;
      registry study of pancreaticoduodenectomy procedures, chemotherapy for malignancy was&#xD;
      performed in only about 33% (on time in 7% and delayed in 25.6 % of patients) and never&#xD;
      delivered in about 67,4 % of patients who experienced a grade C fistula. Therefore,&#xD;
      postoperative complications following pancreaticoduodenectomy can lead to early&#xD;
      discontinuation of the complete oncologic strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total pancreatectomy rather than a pancreaticoduodenectomy is an alternative procedure that&#xD;
      involves the complete and definitive resection of all pancreatic tissue, eliminating any risk&#xD;
      of postoperative pancreatic fistula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total pancreatectomy could represent a major shift in the surgical management of patients&#xD;
      with a high-risk of postoperative fistula by eliminating the life-threatening risk associated&#xD;
      with fistula and by increasing the opportunity to initiate and to complete adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy without delay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, total pancreatectomy is associated with unavoidable endocrine insufficiency and&#xD;
      potentially severe metabolic complications, such as &quot;brittle diabetes&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total Pancreatectomy with intraportal Islet AutoTransplantation (TPIAT) is currently&#xD;
      performed in patients with chronic pancreatitis under chronic pain failing endoscopic&#xD;
      treatment and dependent on long-term opioid treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, islet autotransplantation following total pancreatectomy can prevent &quot;brittle&#xD;
      diabetes&quot; and improve the quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The endocrine islets can be isolated from the pancreatic surgical specimen with standardized&#xD;
      procedures and transplanted in the liver through intraportal infusion, in absence of&#xD;
      immunosuppression and allow adequate control of glucose metabolism with a reduced need for&#xD;
      exogenous insulin and an effective graft function in 70% of cases at 3 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thereby, the investigators hypothesize that total pancreatectomy with intraportal Islet&#xD;
      autotransplantation rather than classical pancreaticuduodenectomy, in patients with high-risk&#xD;
      of postoperative fistula will increase the rate of complete access to adjuvant chemotherapy,&#xD;
      while maintaining an adequate metabolic control.&#xD;

    <description>The total pancreatectomy will be performed in two steps: The pancreatectomy will begin by a standard pancreaticoduodenectomy procedure.&#xD;
The section margin will be sent for intraoperative histological analysis to confirm the absence of invasion of the left remnant pancreas.&#xD;
When absence of tumor invasion is confirmed and the high-risk of postoperative pancreatic fistula is validated intraoperatively, the extended left distal pancreatectomy will be performed, with splenic preservation when possible.&#xD;
Then, the left side of the pancreas will be resected and cooled (4-6°) in the preservation solution and shipped to Lille Biotherapy platform to perform islet isolation and purification. The reconstruction after total pancreatectomy will be done as usually performed by center expert surgeon.</description>
