  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the aging of the population due to an increase in longevity, the number of people with&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease is increasing (166,712 in France, as of December 31, 2015) and the number&#xD;
      of patients with motor or cognitive-behavioral disorders is already a major public health&#xD;
      challenge (1). In neurodegenerative diseases, the current strategy is to identify the disease&#xD;
      early and, if possible, to consider therapeutic measures to slow down the progression of the&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Classically, when faced with the early stages of Parkinsonism, the investigators&#xD;
      differentiate idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) from atypical Parkinsonian syndromes (AP),&#xD;
      which include multiple system atrophy (MSA), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), and progressive&#xD;
      supranuclear palsy (PSP), for which the prognoses are more severe and the therapies less&#xD;
      effective. In the early stage of the disease, when the symptoms are not do no yet&#xD;
      differentiate the diseases, the differential diagnosis between IPD and PSP is a real&#xD;
      challenge for clinicians (2). Cerebral MRI can help in the diagnosis but is most often only&#xD;
      an indicator, as it may be normal in the early stages of the disease (2). The recent&#xD;
      emergence of targeted therapies, specific to tauopathies or synucleinopathies, makes it&#xD;
      essential to establish a diagnosis as early as possible in order to curb the evolution of the&#xD;
      disease (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose here a first study on the analysis of biomarkers of&#xD;
      neurodegeneration from lipid metabolism allowing to discriminate IPD and AP from peripheral&#xD;
      blood. Two recent studies have provided evidence of the discriminatory character of&#xD;
      neurofilament blood testing in the early phases of parkinsonism (4,5). On the other hand, to&#xD;
      our knowledge, none of them has studied markers from mitochondrial and peroxisomal&#xD;
      metabolism, which could play a key role in the pathophysiology of these diseases&#xD;
      (6,7,8,9,10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our strategy will therefore be to study idiopathic or atypical Parkinsonism subjects with a&#xD;
      clearly established diagnosis in a cross-sectional manner, and to identify one or more blood&#xD;
      markers of neurodegeneration predictive of IPD or AP, hypothesizing that these markers will&#xD;
      be at significantly different levels between the two groups (descriptive analysis). The&#xD;
      markers studied will include markers of neurodegeneration, markers of mitochondrial function,&#xD;
      peroxisomal function and oxidative stress. The investigators will then study the correlations&#xD;
      between these biomarkers and motor scores of disease severity.&#xD;
