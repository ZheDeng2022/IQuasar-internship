    <textblock>
      Arthroscopic partial meniscectomy(APM) surgery outcomes for Metabolic Syndrome(MetS) patients&#xD;
      with degenerative meniscus tears(DMTs) was still not clear. In the study, MetS patients with&#xD;
      DMTs knee function outcomes of early APM vs delayed APM were assessed.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Degenerate meniscus tears(DMTs) were the most common knee disease in aged and obese people.&#xD;
      The most common treatment for DMTs was arthroscopic partial meniscectomy(APM) surgery and&#xD;
      over half a million surgeries are performed annually in the USA. However, the outcomes of APM&#xD;
      surgery were much better in traumatic meniscus tear than DMTs, and whether early APM or&#xD;
      delayed APM surgery can be better for DMTs was still unknown, especially in obese patients&#xD;
      with Metabolic syndrome(MetS). Abdominal obesity, insulin resistance with or without glucose&#xD;
      intolerance, dyslipidemia or elevated blood pressure are included in the principal components&#xD;
      of MetS, and widely prevalence in China and all around the world. MetS were associated with&#xD;
      knee osteoarthritis or bone marrow lesion and cartilage volume loss. However, relationship&#xD;
      between DMTs and MetS was less explored. APM surgery outcomes for MetS patients with DMTs and&#xD;
      whether early APM or delayed APM surgery were more benefit for MetS patients were unknown.&#xD;
