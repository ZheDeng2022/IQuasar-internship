  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to better guide clinical medication, verify the efficacy and safety of ABCD in the&#xD;
      treatment of various invasive fungal disease, the investigators have designed a multi-center,&#xD;
      retrospective registration study. Diagnosis and treatment data for patients with different&#xD;
      types of invasive fungal disease in clinical actual environment was collapsed by a database&#xD;
      for collaborative exchange on antifungal research.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a retrospective, non-interventional, and observational study. The clinical data&#xD;
      of the patient during hospitalization shall be collected at least 2 weeks after the end of&#xD;
      the ABCD drug, including basic data of the patient, laboratory data and clinical treatment,&#xD;
      mainly covering antifungal medications, such as pretreatment measures, drug dosage and&#xD;
      dispensing method, route of administration, duration of administration, efficacy and adverse&#xD;
      reactions, etc. If adverse events related to ABCD have not ended after 2 weeks, investigators&#xD;
      are advised to follow up until the adverse events recover or stabilize. It is hoped that the&#xD;
      basic situation of Chinese invasive fungal patients is described, and ABCD is evaluated in&#xD;
      the treatment of invasive fungal patients. In addition, prognostic factors can be analyzed to&#xD;
      optimize clinical medication regimen and provide basis support for clinical medication of&#xD;
      ABCD.&#xD;
