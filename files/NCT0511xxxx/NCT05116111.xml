  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, multi-center, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, phase&#xD;
      II clinical trial to evaluate safety, tolerance, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics and&#xD;
      efficacy of SYHA1402 tablets in DPN patients. A total number of 135 patients will be&#xD;
      randomized (2:2:1) into three groups. Patients between 18 and 75 years old and diagnosed with&#xD;
      a Distal Symmetric Polyneuropathy (DSPN) prior to study enrolment will be enrolled. The study&#xD;
      consists of 4 stages: a 2-week screening period, a 1-week placebo introduction period, a&#xD;
      16-week randomized double-blind treatment period, and a 2-week post-study follow-up period.&#xD;
      The overall planned duration of this study is approximately 21 weeks.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from baseline in modified Toronto Clinical Neuropathy Score (mTCNS)- Sensory Test Score at week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to week 16 post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>To Compare SYHA1402 with placebo, the overall score and symptom score of mTCNS changes from baseline at week 16. The mTCNS examines signs and symptoms of polyneuropathy. It consists of a questionnaire which explores the presence of foot pain, numbness, tingling, weakness, and loss of sensation leading to ataxia. Secondly, sensory tests will be performed including sensation for pinprick, light touch, temperature, vibration and position sense. The minimum value is 0 meaning the patient does not show any signs or symptoms of polyneuropathy and the maximum value is 33 meaning the patient presents with severe signs and symptoms of polyneuropathy.</description>
