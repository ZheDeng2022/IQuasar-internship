    <textblock>
      Spinal cord injury is caused by any harmful process in the spinal cord, impairing its&#xD;
      function, generating loss of muscle strength, impairing orthostatism and walking. In&#xD;
      rehabilitation, some strategies are used to activate the muscles involved in the gait of&#xD;
      these individuals, including the ergometric bicycle and the elliptical. Understanding the&#xD;
      pattern of muscle activation generated by these methods is important to answer questions&#xD;
      arising from clinical practice. Thus, we seek to verify the pattern of muscle activation of&#xD;
      the vastus laterals, vastus medialis, gluteus medius, tibialis previous, rectus abdominis and&#xD;
      paravertebral muscles during exercises with ellipticals and ergometric bicycle with and&#xD;
      without electromyography biofeedback in individuals with spinal cord injury. Cross-sectional&#xD;
      study of the type crossover. Individuals will sign the Informed Consent Form (FICF) and&#xD;
      answer the identification form. They will be evaluated for functionality using the Functional&#xD;
      Independence Measure (FIM), injury classification by the American Spinal Injury Association&#xD;
      (ASIA) and muscle tone by the modified Ashworth scale. Later, they will be randomized to&#xD;
      define the order of the devices in which they will be evaluated. Muscle activity will be&#xD;
      verified with electromyography of the paravertebral, abdominal, vastus laterals, vastus&#xD;
      medialis, gluteus medius and tibialis anterior unilateral muscles on the right side of&#xD;
      individuals, comparing muscle activation during exercise cycling, elliptical and adding&#xD;
      biofeedback in both modalities. The wash-out interval between each evaluation will be 7 days.&#xD;
      We hypothesize that the elliptical with biofeedback will cause greater activation of the&#xD;
      assessed muscles.&#xD;

      Spinal cord injury is caused by any mechanism of injury that attacks and impairs the&#xD;
      integrity of the spinal cord, preventing it from performing its functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is estimated that the incidence of spinal cord trauma in Brazil is greater than 10,000 new&#xD;
      cases per year, 80% being men and 60% aged between 10 and 30 years, with trauma being the&#xD;
      predominant cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial trauma causes injuries by mechanical force, which can cause damage by compression,&#xD;
      laceration or section. Any damage to this structure triggers an inflammatory response with&#xD;
      edema and, consequently, ischemia, gradually aggravating the injury process, compromising&#xD;
      neuronal homeostasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ASIA scale is globally standardized to assess the type of injury. With this scale it is&#xD;
      possible to assess the sensory levels preserved through the corresponding dermatomes at each&#xD;
      level, testing the superficial and deep sensitivity below the level of the lesion. Motor&#xD;
      level is assessed by myotomes, grading the strength of each muscle corresponding to spinal&#xD;
      levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurological disorders resulting from spinal cord injury compromise motor, sensory and&#xD;
      autonomic functions, resulting in total or partial loss of voluntary muscle activity,&#xD;
      sensitivity, functioning of the urinary, intestinal, respiratory, circulatory and&#xD;
      reproductive systems. At the corresponding level, epicritic sensitivity is preserved as it&#xD;
      courses in the ipsilateral posterior funiculus. There will also be loss of painful and&#xD;
      thermal sensations due to disruption of the nerve fibers that cross the white commissure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle weakness is the most limiting impairment caused by neurological damage. There is a&#xD;
      limitation of activity and several restrictions, which influence the quality of life. The&#xD;
      deficit in muscle strength leads to limitations in performing a series of functional&#xD;
      activities. The strength of major muscles or muscle groups contributes to functional&#xD;
      capacity. Functional independence is positively associated with the peak torque performed by&#xD;
      the muscles used to perform a given task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physiotherapy has an essential role in the acute and chronic care of these patients, acting&#xD;
      as a guide, promoting a greater level of independence, and should aim at preventing&#xD;
      deformities, modulating muscle tone, enhancing respiratory muscle function, using various&#xD;
      techniques such as transfer training, postural changes, wheelchair handling, balance&#xD;
      training, orthostatism and, within the patient's functional potential, restoration of gait&#xD;
      and lower limb function, benefiting the performance of activities of daily living, and&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In spinal cord injury, the deficit of muscle activation compromises many functional actions&#xD;
      such as the development of gait, but there are encouraging results with physical therapy&#xD;
      techniques that are effective in improving the prognosis of locomotor movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, a set of factors influence gait, which results from an interaction and&#xD;
      organization of the neural and mechanical systems, in addition to musculoskeletal dynamics,&#xD;
      modulation of the upper nervous system and the afferent pathway, which is also controlled by&#xD;
      the Central Pattern Generator through a programming based on a predetermined spinal circuit,&#xD;
      capable of producing a rhythm associated with gait.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Central Pattern Generator is a network of neurons that can produce a variety of movement&#xD;
      activity, responsible for automating gait, which depends on feedback from proprioceptors and&#xD;
      higher nerve interactions. This generator is responsible for rhythmic motor patterns,&#xD;
      generated by inhibitory and excitatory processes of the lower limbs during movements. There&#xD;
      is an excitatory and inhibitory relay between agonist and antagonist muscles alternating&#xD;
      between limbs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In these patients, this neuronal domain is compromised, making it difficult to modulate&#xD;
      muscle activation. However, recent studies have suggested the existence of effective&#xD;
      responses in locomotor training with partial body weight support, leading to an improvement&#xD;
      in locomotor patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Locomotor training with partial weight bearing for neurological patients has been studied and&#xD;
      considered an important therapeutic mechanism in order to reduce the effects caused by&#xD;
      changes in spinal cord injury, being able to fully explore the activation of the patient's&#xD;
      potential inducing neural plasticity, providing motor related relearning to the specific&#xD;
      task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Locomotor exercises are based on standardized neural activity. Process by which the central&#xD;
      nervous system develops its structure and function in human growth. Continuous repetition of&#xD;
      movement can help create this neural pattern in the brain and spinal cord.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are some devices used in the physiotherapy routine that work rhythmically, for&#xD;
      locomotor training and activation of several muscles recruited in the performance of these&#xD;
      motor tasks, including the elliptical and the bicycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The elliptical is a walking simulator and can also be used for this purpose, which is&#xD;
      advantageous in this modality as it reduces the impact on joints, benefiting individuals with&#xD;
      impaired balance, as the feet remain in continuous contact with the support surface.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The elliptical provides training with cyclic movement, alternating the lower limbs through a&#xD;
      system of levers and sliding axles. When compared to walking on a treadmill, studies suggest&#xD;
      that the elliptical reduces plantar pressure in the contact phase of the heel, in addition to&#xD;
      reducing the impact of the foot with the contact surface, increasing muscle involvement and&#xD;
      increasing the contact phase. individuals with balance deficits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the use of the elliptical, the trunk, hip and knee maintain a greater degree of&#xD;
      flexion, indicating greater muscle activation of the glutes and vastus lateralis, compared to&#xD;
      walking on the ground.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the elliptical, the static bicycle, used in routine motor rehabilitation, can&#xD;
      also be a means of training and muscle recruitment. There is movement of the knees during&#xD;
      pedaling, the extension being the most impactful, since knee flexion is passive, as there is&#xD;
      no greater activation of the flexors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pedaling variation is composed of two phases, the ascending, when the pedals move from&#xD;
      the bottom to the top, and the descent, where the pedal displacement occurs from the top to&#xD;
      the bottom, with greater power.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cycling exercise can be used for muscle activation and strengthening, also performed&#xD;
      rhythmically and alternately between the pedals. In the descending phase, there is activation&#xD;
      of the muscles: gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, vastus intermedius, vastus lateralis, vastus&#xD;
      medialis, rectus femoris, gastrocnemius and soleus, with hip and knee extension. In the&#xD;
      so-called ascending phase, the ilipsoas, hamstrings and tibialis anterior muscles are&#xD;
      activated with consequent flexion of the hip and knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electromyography is a representation of the motor control of the muscular system through the&#xD;
      placement of electrodes in the motor units and capture of electrical activity. The&#xD;
      electromyographic analysis is used not only to verify muscle activity, but also to determine&#xD;
      the periods of coactivation of agonist and antagonist muscles, and can assess activity for&#xD;
      function, contraction and learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The electromyography signal originates from the electrical activity of the endplate. Thus,&#xD;
      the electromyographic signal is generated by the union of the activation potentials of the&#xD;
      motor units that are recruited concomitantly, resulting in the interference tracing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electromyographic biofeedback is an electronic instrument that provides information&#xD;
      (feedback) to an individual about a physiological function or response.&#xD;
