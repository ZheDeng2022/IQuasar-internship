  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is a bacteria which causes severe infections and leads to deadly&#xD;
      diseases such as rheumatic heart disease which kills over 300,000 people a year globally,&#xD;
      particularly in low-income countries. It is not know how GAS is spread between people, how&#xD;
      often people carry GAS in their throat or on their skin without having symptoms, or what&#xD;
      factors increase the chance of this occurring. It is important to understand these factors in&#xD;
      order to know how to reduce GAS-related disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will follow 444 people in The Gambia, over 12 months, taking samples from the&#xD;
      throats and skin of people living in the same households, and asking questions about&#xD;
      themselves and their behaviour, at regular intervals. By taking samples over time, the&#xD;
      investigators hope to understand how common it is to carry GAS without having symptoms, how&#xD;
      GAS is spread between people, and whether carrying GAS leads to more GAS infections in people&#xD;
      or their household members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will use state-of-the-art techniques to look at the DNA of GAS bacteria that we&#xD;
      find, and combine this with a mathematical model to investigate how different strains spread&#xD;
      to people within and between households in the community.&#xD;

      Type of study and design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a prospective, longitudinal (open) cohort study within households in Sukuta, The&#xD;
      Gambia. Households will be recruited, and all available household members asked to&#xD;
      participate. Households will be followed for 12 months, with up to monthly visits (at least&#xD;
      3-monthly visits), and more frequently for some subgroups of participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 45 households will be recruited, including every available household member as&#xD;
      individual participants (resulting in a cohort of approximately 450 participant with the&#xD;
      average household size in Sukuta being around 10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Households will be enrolled for 12 months, with enrolment aiming to commence before the rainy&#xD;
      season, to ensure that the enrolment period will span one full rainy season, with dry periods&#xD;
      either side. Every household will undergo an enrolment visit (MV0), then up to monthly visits&#xD;
      (MV1, MV2, MV3 etc., up to MV12) or less frequently if practical constraints arise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each visit an oropharyngeal swab, normal skin swab, oral fluid sample and dried blood spot&#xD;
      sample will be taken from all individuals, data collected on socio-demographics, social&#xD;
      mixing behaviour and clinical examination findings. Examination findings recorded will&#xD;
      include evidence of pharyngitis, pyoderma, and scabies. In addition, a blood sample for serum&#xD;
      will be taken at the beginning and end of the study for detailed functional immune responses.&#xD;
      Swabs will also be taken from any pyoderma lesions, from common touch points in the household&#xD;
      such as door handles, and settle plates used inside households.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Swabs will be transported the same day to the laboratory and plated for microbiological&#xD;
      culture. The culture will identify the presence of GAS from the swabs, and if present,&#xD;
      antibiotic resistance will be determined and isolates stored for later use. Additionally, if&#xD;
      Groups C and G Streptococcus are identified the isolates will be stored, and from normal skin&#xD;
      and pyoderma wound swabs, any Staphylococcus aureus isolates will stored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Swabs from participants will be cultured for the presence of GAS and isolates will undergo&#xD;
      whole genome sequencing in order to assess phylogenetic relatedness of strains identified.&#xD;
      These data, combined with temporal incidence of strain acquisition, clinical data and&#xD;
      household situation will be used to build a mathematical model of GAS transmission to&#xD;
      identify key routes of transmission within and between households.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intensified incident GAS surveillance cohort&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subgroup of 12 households, most with at least one asymptomatic GAS carrying individual at&#xD;
      baseline, and some with no carriers, will form a cohort to undergo intensified swabbing. This&#xD;
      cohort will be used to assess incidence of GAS carriage and disease with greater resolution&#xD;
      than the main cohort. All household members present will undergo more frequent swabbing, with&#xD;
      a view to being visited every week for 6 months. At these visits, more detailed social-mixing&#xD;
      behaviour data will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimating duration of GAS carriage&#xD;
&#xD;
      A further subgroup will also be identified to allow for greater resolution in the estimation&#xD;
      of the duration of GAS carriage. Following enrolment, any participant who becomes GAS carrier&#xD;
      positive (i.e. was negative at baseline or the previous visit, and then becomes positive&#xD;
      asymptomatically) will have weekly swabs taken from the same site that was positive, until 2&#xD;
      GAS negative swabs have been taken in a row.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimating GAS infection incidence&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess incidence of clinical GAS disease in the cohort throughout the study, all&#xD;
      participants reporting symptoms suggestive of possible clinical GAS infection such as&#xD;
      pharyngitis or pyoderma (but also including invasive infections), will be visited for an&#xD;
      unscheduled visit where a clinical and health-seeking history will be recorded, a swab,&#xD;
      saliva and DBS taken, and treatment (or further management) will be delivered according to&#xD;
      WHO guidelines or best local practice. Furthermore, at each scheduled visit, any individual&#xD;
      identified with symptoms of clinical GAS infection will undergo the same process of&#xD;
      history-taking, swabbing, treatment and follow up.&#xD;

        Sukuta is an area within the West Coast Region peri-urban conurbation of The Gambia, with a&#xD;
        population of 47,048 in 2013, including 7,234 children aged under 5 years, and an average&#xD;
        household size of 8.1. The Gambia is the smallest mainland country in Africa with a&#xD;
        population of 1.9 million in 2013 and was ranked 174th in the world in the UN Human&#xD;
        Development Index in 2017.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Households within the 2013 boundaries of Sukuta will be randomly selected using a list of&#xD;
        randomly generated GPS locations stratified by housing density (high, medium and low). All&#xD;
        eligible and willing households identified using the GPS location list will be enrolled,&#xD;
        until the target sample size of 45 households is reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All individuals living within the households will be enrolled, with no age restrictions.&#xD;
