  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BESRA is a national, multi-center, prospective, observational study to assess the&#xD;
      effectiveness of brolucizumab intravitreal injections in patients with nAMD treated in the&#xD;
      UK.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Data will be collected in a standardized manner from hospital medical records (paper and&#xD;
      electronic) at participating centers for up to 60 months post- initiation of brolucizumab. In&#xD;
      addition to the collection of data from medical records, retinal OCT images collected during&#xD;
      the first two years of treatment will be transferred to a central reading center for&#xD;
      independent grading and interpretation, in order to support the validity of anatomical&#xD;
      measurements relevant to the primary and secondary study objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be treated with brolucizumab according to routine clinical practice,&#xD;
      independent of the study setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key study design definitions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Index date: the date of the first brolucizumab injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Index eye: the first eye to be injected with brolucizumab (analyses will be conducted&#xD;
           for the index eye only, unless otherwise stated).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-index period: time between index date and the earliest of treatment&#xD;
           discontinuation, date of death or the date of the last recorded visit within the 60&#xD;
           months post-index (2-month window).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study period: The period between 01 September 2020 and 01 March 2027, to allow 6 months&#xD;
           pre-index period and up to 60 months (±2 months window) follow-up for each enrolled&#xD;
           patient.&#xD;
