  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PROVECT study is a retrospective, multicentre study assessing the effectiveness and the&#xD;
      safety outcomes in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) treated by apixaban&#xD;
      between 2015 and 2019 (5 years follow up). The study will use harmonized and federated&#xD;
      hospital electronic health records (EHRs) from 10 Belgian hospitals. Outcomes of interest are&#xD;
      major bleeding events leading to hospitalization (safety), stroke and systemic thromboembolic&#xD;
      events (effectiveness), and all-cause mortality (as an exploratory endpoint, and after&#xD;
      confirming the data availability because the death events are not always recorded into&#xD;
      hospital EHRs). The study will analyse the outcomes by patient characteristics including the&#xD;
      age groups focusing on elderly, thromboembolism risk factors (CHAR2RDSR2R-VASc score),&#xD;
      bleeding risk factors (HAS-BLED score), comorbidities (Deyo-Charlson Comorbidity Index, DCCI)&#xD;
      score and frailty.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Apixaban is an antithrombotic agent that directly inhibits factor Xa, and which has obtained&#xD;
      market authorization in the indication &quot;prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in&#xD;
      patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF), with one or more risk factors, such as&#xD;
      prior stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA), age ≥75 years, hypertension, diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus, and symptomatic heart failure (NYHA ≥ class II).&quot; Among other direct oral&#xD;
      anti-coagulants (DOACs) only apixaban has shown a triple beneficial profile (on&#xD;
      stroke/systemic embolisms, major bleedings, and all-cause mortality) supported by data from&#xD;
      pivotal randomized clinical trials (RCTs). This differentiation has been consistently found&#xD;
      in multiple real-world data (RWD) studies including the NAXOS study in France5 and the&#xD;
      ARISTOPHANES study in US particularly in terms of incidence of major bleedings for apixaban&#xD;
      vs. others DOACs or vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). Although such data can be generalized to&#xD;
      different populations, healthcare professionals in Belgium and healthcare authorities have&#xD;
      been frequently requesting local scientific data to support the effectiveness and safety&#xD;
      outcomes in patients treated by apixaban in local Belgium settings. This scientific data gap&#xD;
      is particularly evident for routine care data allowing to understand the apixaban use&#xD;
      patterns in the Belgian poly-medicated, frail and new patients starting an apixaban&#xD;
      treatment. The PROVECT study aims to address this particular local data gap and its results&#xD;
      may help to guide practical clinical decisions .&#xD;
