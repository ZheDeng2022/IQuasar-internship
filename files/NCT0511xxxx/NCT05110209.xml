  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this cross-sectional study of patients with wet AMD who received ≥1 anti-VEGF injection&#xD;
      (excluding brolucizumab), evidence was generated to describe the period prevalence of&#xD;
      specific ocular AEs. The study was conducted using the IRIS Registry, and all results were&#xD;
      based on the study period from 01/01/2019 to 12/31/2019.&#xD;

      This was a retrospective cohort study of eyes in adult patients with a diagnosis of wet AMD&#xD;
      who were treated with anti-VEGF agents from 01/01/2019 to 12/31/2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IRIS Registry data from 01/01/2019 to 12/31/2019 for patients with a diagnosis of wet AMD who&#xD;
