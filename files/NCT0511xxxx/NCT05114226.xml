      This study was a single-center prospective phase I clinical study to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness and safety of BH4 in the treatment of radiation-induced skin injury during&#xD;
      vulvar cancer radiotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vulvar Cancer is a type of rare gynecological malignant tumor, accounting to2~5% of all the&#xD;
      female reproductive system malignancies, and mostly occurs in the postmenopausal women. The&#xD;
      incidence of vulva cancer is on the rise, especially in the elderly women, with age 75 years&#xD;
      and above. It may be related to non-neoplastic epithelial lesions such as lichen sclerosus of&#xD;
      the vulva and atypical hyperplasia of the epithelial cells caused by advanced age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiotherapy plays a key role in the treatment of vulvar cancer. High risk factors for&#xD;
      postoperative recurrence include positive surgical margin, adjacent surgical margin (&lt;8 mm),&#xD;
      lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI), lymph node metastasis (especially more than two&#xD;
      metastatic nodes), and extracapsular invasion of lymph nodes. Patients with high risk factors&#xD;
      for postoperative recurrence can benefit from radiotherapy. Radical radiotherapy and&#xD;
      chemotherapy could be provided to patients with unresectable locally advanced tumors,&#xD;
      including part of stage II (tumor diameter&gt; 4 cm or tumor invading vagina, urethra, and&#xD;
      anus), and to early-stage patients with possible serious postoperative complications or&#xD;
      serious complications that do not allow surgery as an option. Due to the dampness of the&#xD;
      vulva and the poor tolerance of the skin and mucous membranes to radiation, most patients&#xD;
      with vulvar cancer have severe skin damage during radiotherapy, significantly affecting their&#xD;
      treatment process, worsening their prognosis, and impairing their quality of life. Seeking&#xD;
      safe and effective prevention and treatment measures for radiation-induced skin injury is&#xD;
      particularly important to improve the prognosis of patients and improve their quality of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Free radicals generated by the indirect action of ionizing radiation on skin cells are&#xD;
      considered to be the primary cause of radiation skin injury. Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), also&#xD;
      known as Sapropterin, is an important cofactor of the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) enzyme.&#xD;
      Under normal physiological conditions, guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase 1 (GCH1) is the&#xD;
      key enzyme for the synthesis of BH4. Reduced GCH1 activity lowers the production of BH4,&#xD;
      causing NOS uncoupling, thereby leading to a raised level of oxygen free radicals (reactive&#xD;
      oxygen species, ROS). Studies have shown that GCH1 overexpression restores the BH4 level and&#xD;
      NO products in irradiated skin cells, reversed and inhibited the NOS uncoupling caused by&#xD;
      ionizing radiation, thereby eliminating the ROS induced by ionizing radiation, reducing DNA&#xD;
      damage, and postponing the cell apoptosis and cell aging. In animal experiments, direct&#xD;
      injection of BH4 under the skin did not only reduce the degree of acute radiation skin&#xD;
      injury, but also promoted the repair of the skin damage, lowered the occurrence of&#xD;
      radiation-induced skin fibrosis, and maintained the normal physiological functions of the&#xD;
      skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was a single-center prospective phase I clinical study. The phase I clinical trial&#xD;
      included 21 patients. Given satisfactory results, the cases appropriate for the study of drug&#xD;
      concentration were expanded to 25, with a total of 45 subjects included eventually. The&#xD;
      subjects of the study were pathologically diagnosed vulvar cancer patients, who needed&#xD;
      postoperative supplemental radiotherapy, patients who received radical radiotherapy and&#xD;
      chemotherapy (unresectable locally advanced tumors, including some stage II with tumor&#xD;
      diameter &gt; 4 cm or tumor invading vagina, urethra, and anus), and early-stage patients with&#xD;
      possible serious postoperative complications or serious complications, wherein the option of&#xD;
      undergoing a surgery was not appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) was employed, using the conventional split mode,&#xD;
      (1.8~2.0) Gy/day, 5 times/week. The vulva and pelvic clinical target volume (CTV) was (45~50)&#xD;
      Gy/25 times. The boost applied for primary visible lesions and metastaticlocal lymph nodes&#xD;
      was (60~70) Gy. The techniques for boost regarding residual tumor and tumor bed area were&#xD;
      determined based on the tumor location and the radiation dose limit of the surrounding&#xD;
      organs. The electron beam vertical irradiation was applied for tumors located superficially.&#xD;
      For residual tumors good for brachytherapy, techniques such as near-distance&#xD;
      post-implantation were adopted to give a radiation boost. The specific dose and type of the&#xD;
      radiation was determined according to the tumor location, size, treatment response, acute&#xD;
      side effects, and whether chemotherapy was accompanied or not. For late-stage, metastatic&#xD;
      vulvar cancer patients and those received radical chemotherapy and radiotherapy, systemic&#xD;
      chemotherapy was provided, with unrestricted chemotherapy regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The degree of the skin injury during the radiotherapy was assessed according to the radiation&#xD;
      morbidity scoring criteria of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG). After the start of&#xD;
      radiotherapy, the degree of the damage to the patient's skin was assessed every week. BH4 was&#xD;
      applied when skin damage≥ Grade I occurred. A sterile gauze was soaked with BH4 solvent,&#xD;
      wringed out, and applied to the treated skin area for 15 minutes. It was applied three times&#xD;
      a day (morning, noon, and evening), until three months after the end of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BH4 gradient: 50, 100, 200, 400, 600, 800, and 1,000 ug/ml.&#xD;
