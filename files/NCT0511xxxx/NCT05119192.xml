  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Veterans with dysvascular lower limb amputation (LLA) have a high fall risk, which persists&#xD;
      despite completion of conventional rehabilitation. The presence of fall risk could be a&#xD;
      primary reason for the high disability and low quality of life outcomes in this Veteran&#xD;
      population. A potential novel intervention for this population is to train performance of&#xD;
      tasks that require both physical and cognitive attention (i.e., dual-tasking). Therefore, the&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to explore relationships between dual-task performance and&#xD;
      self-reported falls for Veterans with dysvascular LLA. Further, dual-tasking occurs during&#xD;
      everyday life and this project will examine the association between dual-task performance and&#xD;
      participation in activities of daily living (basic and instrumental). The results will form&#xD;
      the foundation for development and future study of a novel dual-task training program for&#xD;
      Veterans with dysvascular LLA.&#xD;

      Purpose: To explore the relationship between dual-task performance, self-reported falls, and&#xD;
      activities of daily living for Veterans with lower limb amputation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dual-task performance will be assessed using overground ambulation and serial subtraction.&#xD;
      Dual-tasking will then be compared to single-task silent walking or seated serial subtraction&#xD;
      to determine the category each participant falls into: gait-priority trade off,&#xD;
      cognitive-priority trade off, mutual facilitation, or mutual interference. Self-reported&#xD;
      falls with be assessed with questionnaires including recent falls (1 month, 1 year), number&#xD;
      of falls, fall injuries, and near-falls. Activities of daily living will be assessed using&#xD;
      the Modified Barthel Index, and Frenchay Activities Index. Other self-report descriptive&#xD;
      questionnaires include: demographic information, the Functional Comorbidities Index, and the&#xD;
      Falls Behavioral Scale for the Older Person. Other performance measures include: the Berg&#xD;
      Balance Scale, and the SLUMS cognitive screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Compare the proportion of participants experiencing mutual interference during&#xD;
      dual-task walking between fall groups (Non-fall is 1 fall vs. Recurrent-fall is &gt;1 fall).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Identify the relationships dual-task effects have with self-reported participation in&#xD;
      activities of daily living (basic and instrumental ADLs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Qualitatively explore the effects of dual-tasking on self-reported fall or near-fall&#xD;
      dual-task scenarios. Veterans with dysvascular LLA (n 30) will participate in semi-structured&#xD;
      interviews describing these scenarios, and dual-task awareness in fall prevention.&#xD;

    <measure>Dual-task Performance</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Dual-task performance will be classified into one of 4 categories (gait priority trade off, cognitive priority trade off, mutual interference, or mutual facilitation) based on performance in 3 different 2-minute conditions (gait single task, cognitive single task, dual-task). The gait task will be overground walking on a 12 meter obstacle-free course with a 1 meter turning area. Gait speed (m/s) will be calculated using the total distance covered over the 2 minutes. The cognitive task will be serial subtractions of seven, starting between 590-599. A corrected response rate will be calculated as: responses per second*percent of correct responses. Dual-task performance will represent a participant's performance on improvement or decline on both gait and cognitive performance comparing single and dual-tasking. For example, mutual interference would be a decline in both gait (slower speed), and cognitive (lower corrected response ratio) from single to dual-tasking.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-reported falls</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked: &quot;How many times have you fallen in the last year?&quot;. Participants will be provided with the definition of a fall as: &quot;an unexpected event in which.[you] come to rest on the ground, floor, or lower level&quot; excluding intentional change in position. To account for potential disproportion of Fall groups, follow-up questions will be asked, including: near-falls in the past year, and presence of fear of falling.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Barthel Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Modified Barthel Index assesses 10 different ADLs, with the overall score ranging from 0 (total dependence) to 100 (independence). The MBI has been used effectively for individuals with dysvascular LLA one year after amputation, and demonstrates excellent test-retest reliability in the outpatient setting.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Frenchay Activities Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Frenchay Activities Index is pragmatic for community-dwelling adults to self-rate participation in three domains: domestic chores, leisure/work, and outdoor activities. Frenchay Activity Index scores range from 15-60, with higher scores indicating greater participation in instrumental ADLs.</description>
