  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, 2-part, multi-center, open-label, non-randomized clinical trial to&#xD;
      assess safety and effectiveness of APrevent® VOIS Implants for the treatment of patients with&#xD;
      Unilateral Vocal Fold Paralysis (UVFP). In total 30 evaluable patients are planned to be&#xD;
      enrolled.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The APrevent® VOIS is intended to be permanently implanted during a type I thyroplasty in&#xD;
      individuals suffering from permanent unilateral vocal fold paralysis of various etiologies.&#xD;
      Four post-operative follow-up visits are planned: Week 1 (± 7 days), Week 7 (-7/+28 days),&#xD;
      Month 6 (-14/+28 days) and Month 12 (-14/+28 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This 2-part study will consist of Part A to assess safety of the patients and the following&#xD;
      Part B to assess the performance (effectiveness) of the investigational device. In Part A of&#xD;
      the study 8 patients will be enrolled sequentially within three groups (N=1, N=2, N=5). After&#xD;
      enrolment and 1st Follow-up Visit of each group, a Local Safety Board will review safety and&#xD;
      study data. No preliminary/interim analysis of safety and effectiveness data will be&#xD;
      performed before the end of the study.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The study will consist of two parts to assess safety, and effectiveness of the investigational device.&#xD;
Part A (Safety): In total 8 patients will be enrolled sequentially in three groups (N=1, N=2, N=5). An interval of at least 7 days between the groups will be left to allow the safety board to review individual patient's safety and demographic data. After completion of the first four patients and all three groups in Part A, an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will recommend the initiation of study Part B based on the review of the safety data.&#xD;
Part B: In Part B of the study, the remaining 22 patients of the study will be enrolled non-sequentially.&#xD;
Part A and B (Effectiveness Population) will include: The part A patients will also be used for the confirmatory testing of the primary endpoint. At the end of the study safety of the investigational device will be assessed on patients of part A and B together.</intervention_model_description>
