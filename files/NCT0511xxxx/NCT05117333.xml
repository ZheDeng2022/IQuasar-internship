  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators conduct a large-scale randomized controlled trial in Finland by sending&#xD;
      three types of information letters to households to examine whether the reminder letters&#xD;
      affect healthcare use. All letters remind of the importance of seeking care to treat&#xD;
      potential health problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has two primary objectives are: to evaluate the effects of an information nudge&#xD;
      reminding on the importance of diagnosing and treating health problems and to evaluate the&#xD;
      effects of additionally providing information on the fact that primary care nurse visits have&#xD;
      become exempt from copayments. Main outcomes include the number of primary care nurse visits&#xD;
      and general practitioner (GP) visits in a six-month follow-up.&#xD;
