      to educate about tonic immobility (TI) within a sample of those who experienced TI in the&#xD;
      context of a traumatic event. The investigators expect that this intervention will lead to&#xD;
      improvement in posttraumatic guilt, shame, and PTSD symptoms as compared to an active control&#xD;

    <description>TIP is a 45-minute computerized psychoeducation intervention aimed at addressing maladaptive cognitions and emotions associated with TI while using educational and behavioral techniques commonly used in the treatment of trauma-related disorders. Throughout the psychoeducation program vignettes will be presented to clarify concepts and promote participant engagement. In addition, practice exercises and rating scales will be integrated, where applicable, to increase the interactive nature of the program. The following modules will be addressed in the TI psychoeducation intervention: education, myth busting, and behavioral experiments.</description>

    <description>The Healthy Education Training intervention was developed as a 45-minute online intervention that provides education about physical health habits that can impact mental health, such as diet, exercise, and sleep. This intervention has been used in prior clinical trials to control for effects of general education, general coping techniques, and use of technology. Participants in past clinical trials have reported that HET is engaging and beneficial. However, HET is not expected to have an effect on the main symptom outcomes of the current study (guilt, shame, PTSD symptoms).</description>
