  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cannabis is the most consumed drug in the world and the French are the main consumers in&#xD;
      Europe. The most recognized effects of cannabis on human health are of a neuro-psychic&#xD;
      nature. The medical literature on the effects of cannabis on the lung in general, and on lung&#xD;
      carcinogenesis in particular, is most often reassuring (Tashkin, Chest 2018; Zhang, Int J&#xD;
      Cancer 2015; Ghasemiesfe JAMA Netw. Open. 2019), despite the fact that the concentration of&#xD;
      carcinogens in cannabis smoke is higher than that contained in tobacco smoke (Moir, Chem.&#xD;
      Res. Toxicol. 2008), and that cannabis smoking has been implicated in the occurrence of ENT&#xD;
      cancers. Rather, research focuses on the therapeutic effects of cannabis, especially&#xD;
      analgesics, and even on its possible anti-tumor virtues (Abrams, Jama Oncol. 2020). These&#xD;
      reassuring data should, however, be viewed with a great deal of caution. On the one hand, the&#xD;
      illegal nature of cannabis in most countries and its frequent association with tobacco&#xD;
      consumption make studies on the subject difficult and often biased. On the other hand, the&#xD;
      daily practice of oncologists, who observe numerous cases of advanced and rapidly progressive&#xD;
      lung cancer occurring in young patients who are heavy users of cannabis, raises suspicion of&#xD;
      an unrecognized role of cannabis in lung carcinogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a preliminary multicenter study on French patients under 50 years of age operated for&#xD;
      primary lung cancer (Betser, ERJ 2021), we demonstrated that cannabis consumption was&#xD;
      extremely frequent, concerning 43% of patients, but mentioned in patients' medical records&#xD;
      only in 4 out of 10 cases, while the smoking status was always noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, by comparing people who smoke cannabis (always here associated with tobacco) to&#xD;
      patients who only smoke tobacco or to non-smokers, we identified a different profile of lung&#xD;
      cancers, with more poorly differentiated tumors, presenting at a more advanced stage (more&#xD;
      T3-T4 versus T1-T2) requiring more complex surgery, and mostly located in the upper lobes of&#xD;
      the lung.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similar research work is currently underway at Gustave Roussy (Dr Pradere-Dr Planchard,&#xD;
      Villejuif, France) on patients with metastatic lung cancer, with a focus on overall survival&#xD;
      and molecular profile.&#xD;
