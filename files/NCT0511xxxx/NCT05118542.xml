  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During July 2019 to August 2020, a single-blind clinical trial was done to 36 patients with&#xD;
      Graves' disease. At the beginning of the study, subjects were accommodated into 2 groups, 17&#xD;
      into PTU groups and 19 into methimazole groups. There were 24 subjects who finished the&#xD;
      study, 13 from PTU group and 11 from methimazole group. Blood serum was collected for&#xD;
      HOMA-IR, LDL-R, NFĸB, sICAM-1, sVCAM-1 and sE-selectin examination. Meanwhile stiffness and&#xD;
      thickness of carotid artery was measured using PWV and cIMT.&#xD;

      This study was a single blind, randomized clinical trial study, conducted in Cipto&#xD;
      Mangunkusumo National Referral Hospital from January 2019 to August 2020. We included all&#xD;
      adult patient aged 18-65 years with newly diagnosed Graves' disease or no prior anti-thyroid&#xD;
      drugs medication for more than 1 month, who agreed to participate in the study. The exclusion&#xD;
      criteria was pregnancy, history of coronary heart disease, known malignancy, current use of&#xD;
      immunosuppressive medication, sepsis, thyroid crisis, or having allergic reaction to&#xD;
      anti-thyroid drugs and other severe side effect. Ethical approval was obtained from the&#xD;
      Research Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia with approval&#xD;
      number KET-784/UN.2.F1/ETIK/PPM.00.02/2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participant was observed every month for 3 months. Anti-thyroid drugs (PTU or&#xD;
      methimazole) were given according to true simple randomization with adjusted dosage according&#xD;
      to patient clinical assessment at every visit by their own endocrinologist. At baseline&#xD;
      visit, first and third month follow up, blood serum was collected to analyse HOMA-IR, LDL-R,&#xD;
      NFĸB, sICAM-1, sVCAM-1 and sE-selectin, meanwhile PWV and cIMT were measured using&#xD;
      radiofrequency ultrasound examination of carotid arteries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Categorical data was presented in frequency (%), while numerical data was presented using&#xD;
      mean (SD) if normally distributed or median (IQR) if not normally distributed. Correlation&#xD;
      Pearson test was performed for normal distributed data and Spearman test for not normal&#xD;
      distributed data. To analyze the changes in parameter from baseline, first and third month,&#xD;
      repeated ANOVA and General Linear Model test was performed. For not normally distributed&#xD;
      data, transformation into normally distributed data was performed and the data was presented&#xD;
      as geometric mean (CI 95%).&#xD;
