  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allergy prevalence is increasing steadily with some describing as the &quot;epidemic of the&#xD;
      twenty-first century&quot;. Maternal diet during pregnancy has been linked to offspring allergy&#xD;
      risk, so it represents a potential target for allergy prevention. The Mediterranean Diet (MD)&#xD;
      is considered one of the healthiest dietary models which exerts regulatory effects on immune&#xD;
      system, due to the synergistic and interactive combinations of nutrients. We aim to study the&#xD;
      effects of MD in pregnancy on the onset of allergic diseases at 2 years of age in the&#xD;
      offspring.&#xD;
