  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled,&#xD;
      single-ascending dose (SAD) phase 1 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of FBL-MTX in healthy male and female subjects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The product FBL-MTX consists of Methotrexate (MTX) encapsulating liposomes functionalized&#xD;
      with a folate peptide (SP-DS3), which targets activated macrophages of rheumatoid arthritis&#xD;
      (RA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled,&#xD;
      single-ascending dose (SAD) phase 1 study in healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is planned to investigate up to 4 dose levels of FBL-MTX. Each dose level will&#xD;
      consist of 8 healthy male and female subjects (ratio 1:1, male:female) to have 6 subjects&#xD;
      being administered FBL-MTX and 2 subjects being administered placebo (ratio 3:1,&#xD;
      active:placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed to meet the following objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of FBL-MTX following single-ascending&#xD;
           intravenous doses to healthy male and female subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary: To investigate the PK of FBL-MTX following single-ascending intravenous doses&#xD;
           to healthy male and female subjects.&#xD;
