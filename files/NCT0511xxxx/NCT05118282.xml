  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Uncontrolled asthma in school-aged children is a significant public health problem. Latino&#xD;
      children living in low-income contexts are at increased risk for uncontrolled asthma compared&#xD;
      to non-Latino white children, and stress is an unaddressed factor in this disparity.&#xD;
      Therefore, the purpose of the current study is to test an intervention program that teaches&#xD;
      families skills to cope with asthma-related and other sources of stress. Specifically, the&#xD;
      study will compare the effects of the combined coping skills + asthma management program with&#xD;
      a standard asthma management program in 280 families of Latino children with asthma. The&#xD;
      study will also look at why the program may have an effect, and specifically whether the&#xD;
      program impacts child coping, parent coping, or family asthma management behaviors. The main&#xD;
      hypothesis is that the combined coping skills + asthma management program will improve asthma&#xD;
      outcomes more than the standard asthma management program.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) examining the effects and mediators of&#xD;
      Adapt 2 Asthma (A2A), a coping skills + asthma management intervention, compared to standard&#xD;
      asthma self-management (AM) for Latino children with asthma and their parents/caregivers&#xD;
      living in low-socioeconomic status (SES) contexts. The focus of the study is to test the&#xD;
      effects of A2A on asthma control, quality of life, lung function, school absences, and&#xD;
      emergency department visits, and to identify child and parent mediational pathways of A2A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children ages 9 to 13 years old with asthma and their parents/caregivers will participate.&#xD;
      The investigators will enroll 280 youth who are patients at the partner primary care clinics&#xD;
      and 280 of their parents/caregivers to participate. The investigators will identify patients&#xD;
      with asthma in the study age range through reviewing records from the partner clinics as well&#xD;
      as natural referral when patients attend appointments. The investigators will screen&#xD;
      identified patients for eligibility. Enrolled families will complete assessments at 1 week&#xD;
      pre-intervention, 1 week post-intervention, and at 6- and 12-month follow-up timepoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research staff will collect assessment data in the form of child and parent surveys,&#xD;
      interviews and spirometry. Providers will also audiotape sessions, which will be used for&#xD;
      case supervision and to measure fidelity to the intervention. Youth and parents/caregivers&#xD;
      will provide all data. Participant data will be de-identified and stored in the principal&#xD;
      investigator's locked laboratory, and all computerized data will be encrypted with University&#xD;
      approved encryption software to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of&#xD;
      data.&#xD;

The RSQ is appropriate for ages 9 and older, has been validated cross-culturally, has strong psychometric properties, and shows sensitivity to change as a mediator of coping skills interventions. Children will complete the child self-report form to assess their own coping.</description>

    <description>The Family Asthma Management Symptom Scale (FAMSS) is a semi-structured clinical interview administered jointly to youth (school-aged and older) and parents to assess family asthma management. The FAMSS captures adherence to asthma self-management behaviors such as symptom monitoring, trigger avoidance, and medication and healthcare use within the context of the family. It shows good reliability and is correlated with objective measures of management such as electronically monitored adherence.</description>

    <description>The combined coping skills + asthma management arm is a family-based coping skills + asthma management intervention that is bilingual and culturally relevant for Latino families. This program is manualized with video-guided and interactive content to improve coping with stress and asthma management behaviors for both children and their parents. Coping strategies taught include primary and secondary control coping. Asthma management content is interactive and culturally tailored.</description>
