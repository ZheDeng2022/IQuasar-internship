  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, randomized controlled study was conducted in older patients who ordered&#xD;
      proton pump inhibitor (PPI) at admission in an internal medicine service of tertiary training&#xD;
      and research hospital. In the intervention group, clinical pharmacist-led services (including&#xD;
      medication reconciliation and medication review) were conducted at admission, during&#xD;
      hospitalization and at discharge by using the guidelines and potentially inappropriate&#xD;
      medications (PIM) criteria [AGS Beers Criteria©, 2019]. Medication Appropriateness Index&#xD;
      (MAI), inappropriate PPI cost, and hospitalization for gastrointestinal bleeding within 1&#xD;
      year after discharge were calculated in both groups&#xD;
