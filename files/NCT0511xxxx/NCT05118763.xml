  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of INNA-051 in adults&#xD;
      following household contact with an individual with RT-PCR confirmed SARS CoV-2 infection.&#xD;
      This study will evaluate 2 active dose levels of INNA-051 and placebo.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adults who have a household member with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and have been&#xD;
      in close contact, and who test negative to SARS-CoV-2, will be randomized. Participants will&#xD;
      receive 4 doses of study medication over a 10 day period, and complete symptoms scores and&#xD;
      questionnaires. Development of COVID-19 symptoms will require collection of a nasal swab for&#xD;
      RT-PCR testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telephone visits will occur on Days 2, 4, 10, 21, 28, and 35. Additional visits will occur on&#xD;
      Days 7, 14, and 42 (end of study).&#xD;
