      Primary Objective: To assess PrEP adherence among sexually-active and/or injection-drug&#xD;
      using, HIV-negative cis- and transgender women who use the &quot;SmartPrEP&quot; phone app to support&#xD;
      PrEP adherence during a 12-month period of observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective: To assess the acceptability of using the SmartPrEP app to support HIV&#xD;
      self-testing and partner testing among sexually active and/or injection-drug using,&#xD;
      HIV-negative cisgender and transgender women on PrEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives: To describe patterns of PrEP adherence and user feedback on&#xD;
      acceptability, utility, and features of the app; To assess correlations between self-reported&#xD;
      sexual behavior and PrEP adherence; To assess patterns of HIV testing (self and partner&#xD;
      testing), self-reported reasons for HIV testing, and correlations with test results.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to understand if a smartphone app, SmartPrEP, will help promote&#xD;
      HIV self-testing and PrEP adherence among cisgender and transgender women over a twelve-month&#xD;
      period. As part of this, participants will be required to download the SmartPrEP app and&#xD;
      participate in six study visits starting at enrollment, Month 1, Month 3, Month 6, Month 9,&#xD;
      and Month 12. Most visits will take place at the Bronx Prevention Center and include&#xD;
      adherence counseling, app acceptability assessments, behavioral risk assessments, and STI/HIV&#xD;
      testing. App data will be collected which evaluates PrEP adherence, HIV self-testing, and HIV&#xD;
      partner testing. Additionally, all participants will be invited to take part in either a&#xD;
      focus group discussion (FGD) or an open-ended, in-depth interview (IDI) to elicit their&#xD;
      thoughts and preferences regarding the SmartPrEP app acceptability. Interventions consist of&#xD;
      (1) smartphone app &quot;SmartPrEP&quot;; (2) PrEP medication.&#xD;
