      This study is an investigator-initiated, single site Mayo Clinic Rochester prospective&#xD;
      minimal risk pilot study to determine feasibility and acceptability of Virtual Dignity&#xD;
      Therapy. The Dignity Therapy intervention is a brief, individualized psychotherapy that aims&#xD;
      to relieve psycho-emotional and existential distress and improve the experiences of patients&#xD;
      whose lives are impacted by serious illness. This therapy offers patients an opportunity to&#xD;
      reflect on their life with a trained facilitator and share their thoughts and memories with&#xD;
      family and other people in their life. This therapy consists of a total of 3 sessions, with&#xD;
      each session 2-4 weeks apart, in which the investigator provides questions focused on life&#xD;
      review. The sessions are recorded and transcribed. The interventionist will work with&#xD;
      patients to edit the document and provide a final generativity document for patient to keep&#xD;
      and give to loved ones.&#xD;
