  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients suffering dyspareunia deal with significant pain that affects their quality of life.&#xD;
      Often, conservative treatment interventions are scarce for these patients and are therefore&#xD;
      not considered. Education has been developed as a relevant tool in the treatment of patients&#xD;
      who suffer from chronic pain or any other pain processing alterations, and has the potential&#xD;
      to become a powerfull treatment alternative.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this intervention, the effects of implementing educational programs in patients suffering&#xD;
      from dyspareunia will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with dyspareunia have both problems directly related with their pain and other&#xD;
      issues that appear derived from suffering pain over a determined period, such as alterations&#xD;
      in the sexuality or overall quality of life. Facing these patients is a challenge for&#xD;
      professionals, and many can't find the treatment that properly fits the patient's clinical&#xD;
      presentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Education, and educating patients on their problem, is an exponentially growing alternative&#xD;
      used in Physical Therapy involving patients who suffer from a dysfunctional pain, chronic&#xD;
      pain, or any kind of pain presentation that affects the patient's well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will assess firstly if the implementation of a pain-related education program is&#xD;
      relevant in the treatment of dyspareunia, and will further observe which modality (presential&#xD;
      workshops or online-accessed material) is the most effective involving adherence and&#xD;
      improvement.&#xD;
