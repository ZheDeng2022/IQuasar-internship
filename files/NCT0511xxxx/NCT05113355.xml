      This study is a single-arm, multi-center, two-stage, phase II clinical trial conducted in&#xD;
      China. This study adopts Simon's two-stage design, and the inclusion criteria and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria of the two stages were consistent. Six patients with high-grade neuroendocrine&#xD;
      neoplasm will be enrolled in the first stage. If more than one complete or partial responses&#xD;
      were seen at planned interim analysis, the additional 17 patients will be recruited in the&#xD;
      second stage and a total of 23 patients will be treated.&#xD;
