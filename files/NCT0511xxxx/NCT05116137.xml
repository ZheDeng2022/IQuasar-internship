    <textblock>
      Glioblastoma patients are confronted with a debilitating disease associated with a low&#xD;
      survival rate and poor quality of life. The goal of this study will be to reach a largely&#xD;
      underrepresented population in the exercise literature and explore the role of a tailored&#xD;
      circuit-based resistance training program on functional fitness (i.e., ability to carry out&#xD;
      tasks of daily living) and associated health outcomes (e.g., quality of life) for GBM&#xD;
      patients on active treatment.&#xD;

      PROBLEM: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common brain malignancy accounting for&#xD;
      approximately 48% of all brain tumors. GBMs are highly vascular and can cause vasogenic brain&#xD;
      edema and mass effect, which can worsen the neurologic symptoms associated with the disease.&#xD;
      Corticosteroids (i.e., Dexamethasone; DEX) are the treatment of choice to reduce vasogenic&#xD;
      edema and intercranial pressure associated with GBM. However, the use of steroids comes at a&#xD;
      cost. High dose steroid therapy and/or long-term use results in muscle myopathy (i.e., muscle&#xD;
      weakness) in 10-60% of GBM patients, significantly reducing functional ability as well as&#xD;
      quality of life (QOL). Thus, adjuvant therapies are needed to help patients maintain their&#xD;
      functional ability and QOL. There is a wealth of evidence to support the use of exercise as&#xD;
      an adjuvant therapy to improve functional ability as well as help manage treatment-related&#xD;
      symptoms. Resistance training (RT) has been shown to increase muscle mass, strength, and&#xD;
      functional ability in aging adults and several cancer populations. While limited, studies in&#xD;
      GBM have shown that exercise is safe and feasible for this population and that it can improve&#xD;
      functional performance. However, no specific research has been performed to determine whether&#xD;
      RT can be successfully used in GBM to prevent or reduce steroid induced muscle myopathy.&#xD;
      Therefore, the primary purpose of this study is to establish whether an individualized&#xD;
      circuit-based RT program will improve functional fitness for patients on active treatment and&#xD;
      receiving steroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: This is a two-armed randomized control trial with repeated measures. Thirty-eight&#xD;
      adult (18+ years) patients diagnosed with either primary or secondary GBM who are scheduled&#xD;
      to receive standard radiation and concurrent adjuvant Temozolomide chemotherapy post-surgical&#xD;
      debulking as well as received any dose of DEX will be recruited through the neuro-oncology&#xD;
      clinic and the QEII Cancer Center. Patients will be randomly allocated to a standard of care&#xD;
      group (SOC) or SOC+RT group (EX). Those in the SOC group will be advised to maintain an&#xD;
      active lifestyle for the 12-week intervention whereas those in the EX group will receive a&#xD;
      personalized 12-week circuit-based RT program. This program will consist of 3-4 supervised RT&#xD;
      sessions/wk. During each session participants will perform a RT program that is comprised of&#xD;
      3 circuits. Each circuit will include 3 sets of 3 different exercises. Each exercise set will&#xD;
      be 1 minute in duration (20 seconds/exercise) with 1 minute of rest between sets. Initial&#xD;
      exercise intensity will be light and will increase throughout the program based on the&#xD;
      participant's progress. All exercise programs will be designed and supervised by a Clinical&#xD;
      Exercise Physiologist (CEP). The primary outcome measure for the study is functional&#xD;
      performance which will be assessed using the Short Physical Performance Battery and hand grip&#xD;
      strength. Secondary outcome measures will include body composition, aerobic fitness, physical&#xD;
      activity levels, general health, QOL, fatigue, and cognitive function. All measures will be&#xD;
      assessed pre/post-intervention. Safety and exercise adherence will be assessed throughout the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANALYSIS: Descriptive statistics will be used to describe the population, accrual, program&#xD;
      adherence and safety. Outcome data will be analyzed using an intention to treat approach. All&#xD;
      participants will be entered into a mixed effects model with participant group assignment&#xD;
      (EX, SOC) at randomization and timepoint (pre- and post-test) as fixed factors and&#xD;
      participant entered as a random factor. Due to feasibility in recruiting participants in the&#xD;
      allotted time, the study will not be fully powered to detect sex-based differences; however,&#xD;
      effect sizes associated with the intervention will be calculated and presented separately for&#xD;
      each sex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SIGNIFICANCE: This study will demonstrate the not only is RT safe and feasible for those with&#xD;
      GBM, but that it also significantly improves functional status by protecting against&#xD;
      myopathy. This will help GBM patients maintain their independence which could lead to marked&#xD;
      improvements in QOL.&#xD;
