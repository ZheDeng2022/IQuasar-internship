  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to observe the effects of treatment from a device called the&#xD;
      Bioboosti which utilizes pulsed electromagnetic waves on its ability to improve blood flow to&#xD;
      the heart tissue in individuals with coronary artery disease (CAD).&#xD;

      Pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) therapy is a noninvasive technique, which provides low&#xD;
      field electromagnetic stimulation. The therapy of PEMF is achieved by altering biological and&#xD;
      physiological systems via low energy and non-ionizing electromagnetic fields. PEMF therapy&#xD;
      was originally used clinically to manage osteoarthritis related pain and stiffness and to&#xD;
      augment bone healing. In addition, recent research has explored the beneficial therapeutic&#xD;
      effect of PEMF on microvasculature and circulation. More recently, research interest has been&#xD;
      toward the effect of PEMF on various targets, including peripheral vascular function and&#xD;
      blood flow. It has been suggested that PEMF therapy enhances the binding of free calcium&#xD;
      (Ca2+) to calmodulin (CaM) and this phenomenon might improve tissue repair and pain and&#xD;
      moreover other studies suggested an effect of PEMF on Ca/CaM-dependent nitric oxide (NO)&#xD;
      signaling pathway, which is one of the major components for controlling vascular tone and&#xD;
      blood pressure (BP, figure 1). The investigators have recently demonstrated that in subjects&#xD;
      with metabolic syndrome with hypertension, 12 weeks of daily therapy using Bioboosti tended&#xD;
      to lower BP and raise plasma NO levels as well as improve flow mediated dilation. In a small&#xD;
      pilot study from China, subjects with a history of diffuse coronary disease and evidence of&#xD;
      myocardial ischemia performed radionuclide SPECT before and after PEMF therapy or control. In&#xD;
      this small pilot study there was evidence of reduced ischemia in the treatment group vs a&#xD;
      control group. Thus the focus of this proposal is to pursue a larger clinical trial to&#xD;
      demonstrate the benefits of PEMF therapy using the Bioboosti PEMF device to reduce the&#xD;
      ischemic burden in patients with coronary artery disease.&#xD;

    <description>A portable PEMF device will be utilized. For the PEMF group, the device includes adjustable magnetic field strength range (X-axis: 0.22±0.05 mT, Y-axis: 0.20±0.05 mT and Z-axis: 0.06±0.02 mT) and working frequency (30±3Hz). This magnetic strength range and frequency will be maintained during 180 days of the study period. The subjects will be instructed to use their device three times per day: providing micromagnetic emitting on both hands (palms) during morning, afternoon and evening/night sessions. Each session takes 16 min (both hands, 8 min per hand) and thus subjects are exposed to therapy for 48 min per day. Subjects will use the device as outlined continuously up through the final days of testing.</description>
