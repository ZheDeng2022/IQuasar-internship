      Peripheral neuropathy is a serious condition characterized by symmetrical, distal damage to&#xD;
      the peripheral nerves that may be caused by several classes of drugs, including&#xD;
      chemotherapeutic agents. Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is an adverse&#xD;
      effect estimated to occur in up to 40% of patients undergoing chemotherapy, with its&#xD;
      incidence increasing in patients being treated with multiple agents. Pharmacists play a&#xD;
      pivotal role in the prevention and management of CIPN by recommending evidence-based&#xD;
      pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic strategies appropriate for the individual&#xD;
      patient.Peripheral neuropathy (PN) is a systemic disease characterized by symmetrical, distal&#xD;
      damage to the peripheral nerves that negatively impacts patient quality of life (QOL).&#xD;
      Prolonged symptoms associated with PN can cause pain, interfere with functional ability&#xD;
      (e.g., dressing, driving, house-work), and disrupt emotional health.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Eighty children with tumors were enrolled in this study and were assessed for eligibility. Their aged ranged from eight and forty years. They were assigned randomly into two equal groups. Group (A) study group received the same medical care and shock wave, three times / weak for three successful months. And group (B) control group received medical care and standard chemotherapy only.Nerve conduction studies (NCS) and somatosensory-evoked potentials (SSEPs) were used to assess peripheral neuropathy pre and post intervention. All children were assisted before and after three months of intervention.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Shockwave therapy is a multidisciplinary device used in orthopedics, physiotherapy, sports medicine, urology and veterinary medicine. Its main assets are fast pain relief and mobility restoration. Together with being a non-surgical therapy with no need for painkillers makes it an ideal therapy to speed up recovery and cure various indications causing acute or chronic pain. Shockwave is an acoustic wave which carries high energy to painful spots and myoskeletal tissues with sub-acute, sub-chronic and chronic conditions. The energy promotes regeneration and reparative processes of the bones, tendons and other soft tissues. Shockwaves are characterized by jump change in pressure, high amplitude and non-periodicity. The kinetic energy of the projectile, created by compressed air, is transferred to the transmitter at the end of the applicator and further into the tissue.</description>
