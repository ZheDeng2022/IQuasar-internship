  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was a retrospective cohort study of patients to assess the early insights into&#xD;
      real-world safety among wet AMD patients initiating brolucizumab. Evidence was generated to&#xD;
      describe their patient characteristics and clinical outcomes. The study was conducted using&#xD;
      the Komodo Healthcare Map.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Komodo Healthcare Map claims data from 08-Oct-2016 to the date of most recent data from&#xD;
      patients with wet AMD who initiated brolucizumab were analyzed in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identification period of the index date (index period): The patients fulfilling the&#xD;
           selection criteria were identified during the period from 08-Oct-2019 to 30-Apr-2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Index date: Defined as the date of the earliest brolucizumab injection during the index&#xD;
           period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Period: The period from 08-Oct-2016 to the most recent data extraction date&#xD;
           (05-Jun-2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
           o Note since 05-Jun-2020 was the date data was pulled, claims data from recent months&#xD;
           (e.g. May) may be incomplete (relative to the final DB state) as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-index period: The period 36 months prior to the index date&#xD;
&#xD;
           o Note: Data within 36 months prior to the index date will be used to assess baseline&#xD;
           characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-index period: The period of 180 days after the index date&#xD;
