      A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, superiority, placebo control&#xD;
      clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult patients (aged ≥ 18 years) of both sexes with common cold or flu will be randomized in&#xD;
      a 1:1 ratio to receive the experimental drug (paracetamol 500mg / fexofenadine 60mg /&#xD;
      phenylephrine 20mg) or placebo, in the dosage of one (01) film-coated tablet every eight (08)&#xD;
      hours, for 3 to 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary superiority assessment will be carry out compared the experimental drug to&#xD;
      placebo in the relief of cold and flu symptoms through the absolute variation of the overall&#xD;
      score obtained in the symptom assessment questionnaire after treatment start.&#xD;

The overall symptom score will be determined by the sum of the points assigned to the individual symptoms.
