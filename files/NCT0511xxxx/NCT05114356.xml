  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The registry has been designed as a prospective, observational program for patients&#xD;
      undergoing anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) procedures treated with TIDAL&#xD;
      cervical interbody fusion device. The ultimate goal of the study is to aid in the development&#xD;
      of treatment pathways and improved patient care. All patients who agree to participate in the&#xD;
      registry will sign an informed consent form and subsequently be treated by their surgeon with&#xD;
      the device in either an inpatient or outpatient facility.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The registry is design to collect data prospectively on patients undergoing spinal fusion&#xD;
      using the TIDAL cervical interbody fusion device. Patients will be enrolled in the registry&#xD;
      after reviewing the protocol with their health care provider and signing the informed&#xD;
      consent. Data will be collected at recommended time points based on the standards of care of&#xD;
      the participating sites. The registry will serve as a database in which retrospective&#xD;
      analysis and exploratory analysis of specific research questions will be answered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up visits will be defined by the treating physicians based on their standard practice.&#xD;
      Typical clinical follow up schedules for patients undergoing this type of surgery are&#xD;
      pre-operative and 12 months post-operative.&#xD;
