  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tetrahydrocannabidiol (THC) is the psychoactive chemical in cannabis that makes people high.&#xD;
      This study aims to dissect acute impairment of various forms of memory and learning by THC in&#xD;
      cannabis compared to placebo. Impairment will be assessed via a short cognitive test battery&#xD;
      and then subjects will complete four tasks in the fMRI scanner.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The protocol below is designed to begin dissecting acute impairment of various forms of&#xD;
      memory and learning by THC in cannabis compared to placebo, in a 2-session per subject&#xD;
      double-blind, random assignment, placebo-controlled counterbalanced design in young to&#xD;
      middle-aged adults. The purpose of these experiments is to gather important pilot data to&#xD;
      demonstrate proof of principle for a planned NIDA submission of a P50 center application that&#xD;
      will examine cannabis's differential effects on the neural circuit underpinnings these&#xD;
      various cognitive domains across the lifespan in much more detail. In other words, these&#xD;
      pilot data will show NIDA that the investigators' methods and approaches work and are&#xD;
      suitable for use in their proposed center grant application. Unlike in the planned P50, in&#xD;
      these small-scale pilot studies the investigators are only concerned with comparing these&#xD;
      disrupting effects using a single dose of THC versus placebo, without exploration of age,&#xD;
      sleep, or sex-related differential effects or of different dose-related effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tasks tapping each of the major cognitive memory-related domains will be performed in the MRI&#xD;
      scanner, to reveal the relevant underlying circuitry and its disruption by drug using&#xD;
      functional MRI. Although each of the fMRI tasks is already implemented in the investigators'&#xD;
      lab in other contexts, the investigators have never studied alteration of the fMRI tasks by&#xD;
      THC. Neither have other investigators elsewhere used this approach. It is also important to&#xD;
      point out that the dose of active THC to be administered is the same as that already used&#xD;
      safely in the investigators' IRB-approved driving studies, one which subjects state&#xD;
      subjectively (a blind to actual dose information) makes them feel moderately intoxicated, and&#xD;
      similar to the amount that they would consume themselves recreationally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of 3 days (screening visit and 2 dose days). In a randomized,&#xD;
      counterbalanced, double-blind study, investigators will administer high THC marijuana or&#xD;
      placebo marijuana using paced inhalation through a vaporizer. Following administration,&#xD;
      subjects will provide subjectively-rated CNB intoxication using a verbal analog scale, a&#xD;
      short cognitive test battery, then complete 4 fMRI paradigms within ~1.5 hours: a) MSDM task,&#xD;
      b) MID task, c) RISE task, and d) Treadway Effort/Reward task. These tests will be&#xD;
      counterbalanced across subjects and sessions to minimize order and fatigue effects.&#xD;
