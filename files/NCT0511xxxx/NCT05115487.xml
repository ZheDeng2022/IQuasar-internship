  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hand functions are decreased in rheumatic diseases such as systemic sclerosis and rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sjögren's syndrome (SS) is a chronic systemic rheumatic disease characterized by&#xD;
      lymphoplasmacytic infiltration of exocrine glands, especially salivary and lacrimal glands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SS may be &quot;primary&quot; when it occurs alone (pSS) and &quot;secondary&quot; (sSS) when associated with&#xD;
      another autoimmune disease. PSS is the most common connective tissue disease after rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis and affects 0.3-3% of the population. Joint involvement is the most common&#xD;
      involvement of pSS after sicca syndrome (50% of patients). Patients may have arthralgia with&#xD;
      inflammatory features (morning stiffness &gt; 30 minutes) or, less frequently, true symmetric&#xD;
      polysynovitis mimicking rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The joint involvement of PSS is usually&#xD;
      moderate (&lt;5 affected joints) and mostly affects the small joints of the hands and upper&#xD;
      extremities. PSS may also be responsible for myositis. Widespread pain, similar to primary&#xD;
      fibromyalgia, is common in about 50 percent of patients with PSS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hand is one of the most important components affecting the functionality of the upper&#xD;
      extremity. Grasping is one of the hand functions, for the continuity of daily living&#xD;
      activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      is an important function. Studies have shown that hand grip strength is correlated with upper&#xD;
      extremity muscle strength, as well as general body muscle strength and pulmonary muscle&#xD;
      strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As far as we know, hand functions have not been evaluated in newly diagnosed patients with&#xD;
      pSS.&#xD;
