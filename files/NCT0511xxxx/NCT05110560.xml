  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of all these applications is the same: people keep distance and isolate&#xD;
      themselves from those in risk groups and patients. In Turkey, it was announced by the&#xD;
      Ministry of Health (2020) that the first official COVID-19 case was seen on March 11, 2020.&#xD;
      Immediately afterwards, many pioneering measures were taken, such as travel restrictions,&#xD;
      mandatory quarantine practices for those with a foreign history, interruption of primary,&#xD;
      secondary and higher education, closure of common areas curfews. In order to minimize contact&#xD;
      and ensure social isolation, home quarantine practice was encouraged with the 'Stay at Home&#xD;
      Turkey' campaign. Within the scope of the measures taken, a curfew was imposed for citizens&#xD;
      over 65 years of age who are considered to be risky in terms of high death rate and who have&#xD;
      chronic diseases, as of 21 March - 9 June 2020, and the elderly population became the first&#xD;
      group to leave social environments in our country. However, quarantine and social isolation&#xD;
      for the elderly population due to increased sedentary lifestyle and loneliness pose a serious&#xD;
      public health problem. The COVID-19 epidemic has affected health and quality of life in many&#xD;
      ways, and one of the most affected areas has been healthy lifestyle behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Especially sedentary and sedentary life is of vital importance for the elderly. When the&#xD;
      literature in this field is examined, it is shown that physical activity reduces the risk of&#xD;
      premature death, supports positive mental health and supports healthy aging More importantly,&#xD;
      physical activity sessions don't have to be long to improve health; 10-minute bouts of&#xD;
      moderate to vigorous physical activity are beneficial for the prevention and control of&#xD;
      diseases, and even light activity such as moderate-paced walking is beneficial. In addition,&#xD;
      emphasized that walking is a low-cost activity that, if done at recommended levels, can&#xD;
      reduce the incidence of chronic diseases and associated health care costs. No expensive&#xD;
      equipment or gym membership required to walk; most people can do this by incorporating it&#xD;
      into their daily life. In this study, which is planned from here, it is aimed to examine the&#xD;
      effect of the stay at home program, which is carried out with the mobile initiative to gain&#xD;
      exercise behavior in elderly individuals over the age of 65 who are under mandatory&#xD;
      quarantine at their homes during the COVID 19 pandemic process, on the number of steps,&#xD;
      quality of life and stress level.&#xD;

      Type of Research The study was designed as a randomised controlled study with the control&#xD;
      group Research Sample&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population of the study consists of individuals over the age of 65 in Turkey during the&#xD;
      COVID 19 pandemic. For this purpose, information messages were sent to Tekirdag Namik Kemal&#xD;
      University undergraduate students who continue their distance education between 15 May-1&#xD;
      June. The students were asked to invite individuals aged 65 and over who are in their&#xD;
      immediate environment (relatives, neighbors, etc.) who meet the inclusion criteria to&#xD;
      participate in the study. All volunteer participants in the determined date section were&#xD;
      called by phone and their compliance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria was evaluated.&#xD;
      All participants meeting the inclusion criteria were included in the study population (n=&#xD;
      94). If the minimum sample size cannot be reached, it is planned to extend the participation&#xD;
      period in the study. The sample size was calculated using the G Power program to calculate&#xD;
      the minimum number of samples to be used in the study. In determining the sample size,&#xD;
      considering the previously published articles in which similar interventions were applied,&#xD;
      Type 1 error amount was 0.05, test power was 0.95, and effect size: 0.83; The minimum number&#xD;
      of samples required was determined as 64 (32 experimental + 32 control group) for the&#xD;
      experimental and control groups. All participants meeting the inclusion criteria were&#xD;
      randomly divided into experimental and control groups by a statistician outside the study&#xD;
      using the Random Online Allocation Software program (www.Graphpad.com). A double-blind&#xD;
      technique was used in the assignment of the groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Process After obtaining the ethics committee and institutional permissions for the&#xD;
      research, &quot;Socio-demographic information form&quot;, &quot;EuroQOL General Quality of Life Scale&quot; and&#xD;
      &quot;Perceived Stress Scale&quot; online questionnaires were applied to all elderly people who met the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria as a pre-test. Elderly people who have vision problems and could not&#xD;
      answer the online questionnaire were asked to read and answer questions by telephone&#xD;
      interview. In addition, a pedometer device was sent to all the elderly in the experimental&#xD;
      and control groups. It will be explained in detail how to use it, and they will be asked to&#xD;
      record the number of steps and weights on the &quot;Following Chart&quot; for 2 months. Unlike the&#xD;
      control group, the intervention group will be applied to the &quot;Stay at Home Step by Step&#xD;
      Program&quot; (EKAAP), which will last for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a post-test, &quot;Socio-demographic information form&quot;, &quot;EuroQOL General Quality of Life Scale&quot;&#xD;
      and &quot;Perceived Stress Scale&quot; will be applied to both the experimental and control groups. One&#xD;
      month after the intervention is completed, it will be possible to monitor the change in step&#xD;
      counts, weight values, EuroQOL General Quality of Life Scale and Perceived Stress Scale&#xD;
      scores of the elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Tools&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Socio-Demographic Information Form The Descriptive Questionnaire was created by the&#xD;
           researchers by examining the relevant literature. This form includes questions about&#xD;
           socio-demographic characteristics (age, marital status, gender, education level, number&#xD;
           of children, people with whom they live, place of residence, household size, employment&#xD;
           status).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. EuroQOL General Quality of Life Scale It is a scale developed to assess health-related&#xD;
           quality of life. It consists of two parts: Chapter 1 defines the health profile in five&#xD;
           dimensions (mobility, self-care, social life, pain and psychological state). Each&#xD;
           dimension contains three statements according to difficulty (1 a little problem; 2&#xD;
           medium; 3 a lot of problems), Section 2 includes the visual analog scale, in which&#xD;
           respondents rate their current health status on a scale of 0 to 100. Easy to apply and&#xD;
           quickly identified.Turkish validity and reliability were done by Kahyaoglu Süt and&#xD;
           Ünsar.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Perceived Stress Scale The scale was developed by Cohen et al. Its validity and&#xD;
           reliability study was conducted by Erci, and it was determined that it was adapted to&#xD;
           Turkish society and appropriate.The scale consists of 10 items, and each item receives&#xD;
           1, 2, 3, 4, 5 points, respectively.The scale is evaluated over the total score and the&#xD;
           scores are calculated between 10-50. A score of 30 and above indicates that the&#xD;
           individual has stress. As the score increases, the stress level also increases. In the&#xD;
           validity and reliability study of the scale, it was determined that the test-retest&#xD;
           correlation was 0.88.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Percentage, mean, standard deviation will be used in the evaluation of the data. Chi-square,&#xD;
      Fisher's exact test, independent paired T-test and Mann-Whitney U test will be used for&#xD;
      comparison between groups and within groups. p &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically&#xD;
      significant.&#xD;
