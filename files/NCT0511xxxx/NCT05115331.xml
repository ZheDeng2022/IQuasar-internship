  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized Phase III study evaluating the efficacy of hypofractionated and&#xD;
      dose-escalated palliative radiation therapy in metastatic bone disease (MBD). Patients will&#xD;
      be randomized 1:1 to the conventional (8 Gy in a single fraction) and experimental (16 Gy in&#xD;
      2 fractions) groups with baseline and subsequent assessment of both pain and quality of life&#xD;
      metrics.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Metastatic Bone Disease (MBD) has been demonstrated to be a common clinical problem, and&#xD;
      often presents with severe, if not debilitating pain. This often proceeds to affect a&#xD;
      patient's emotional and even global functioning. Radiation therapy is an effective treatment&#xD;
      commonly used in the palliation of these metastatic lesions, and improvements in QOL scores&#xD;
      are associated with response to radiotherapy treatment. Although both 30 Gy/10 fractions and&#xD;
      8 Gy in a single fraction are considered standard of care in the palliative setting, single&#xD;
      fraction treatment is associated with increased rates of local failure and retreatment.&#xD;
      Considering that patients with MBD often have life-limiting disease, and frequently have&#xD;
      great difficulty with undergoing extended radiotherapy treatments, there is a significant&#xD;
      unmet need for palliative treatments that are effective, safe, timely, and provide a durable&#xD;
      local tumor and pain control. The investigators hypothesize that utilizing a fractionation&#xD;
      scheme with an escalated biologically equivalent dose will result in a higher proportion of&#xD;
      patients responding to treatment, and will also lead to more durable responses.&#xD;

    <description>A primary objective evaluate the efficacy of the addition of a second 8 Gy fraction administered 1 week following the standard 8 Gy treatment currently utilized for palliation of symptomatic bone metastases in solid cancers, as measured by pain response at 1 month. The primary endpoint for this objective is pain response which will be classified using the International Consensus on Palliative Radiation for Future Trials on Bone Mets, which is a 4-point scale ranging from complete response to pain progression. Pain relief as measured by this scale and daily oral morphine equivalents (OME) will be graded at 1 month.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed history of solid cancer&#xD;
             malignancy (including small cell lung cancer).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must have 1-3 new or newly painful metastatic lesions to bone as defined by&#xD;
             CT scan, MRI, or PET scan. Lesions must be located in a long bone, pelvis/hip, spine,&#xD;
             sacrum, or ribs. A lesion is &quot;new&quot; if it has occurred since any previous imaging, or&#xD;
             if new cancer diagnosis, or new at presentation. A newly painful lesion is one that&#xD;
             had been visible on previous imaging, but was either asymptomatic or minimally painful&#xD;
             so that no treatment was pursued.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. There must be clearly attributable pain associated with the 1-3 new metastatic bone&#xD;
             lesion(s) as documented on the Brief Pain Inventory and per investigator's&#xD;
             determination that these imaging findings are consistent with the patient's described&#xD;
             BPI pain from metastatic lesion(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Age ≥18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. ECOG performance status ≤3 or (Karnofsky ≥40%, see Appendix A).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does&#xD;
             not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the&#xD;
             investigational regimen are eligible for this trial in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who have had or will have chemotherapy within 2 weeks (6 weeks for&#xD;
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to commencing study RT. Patients undergoing&#xD;
             treatment with hormonal or endocrine therapies will be eligible for this trial and may&#xD;
             continue these through study radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with widespread metastatic disease, such that in the opinion of the PI would&#xD;
             preclude an investigator from determining the origin of bone disease-related pain&#xD;
             and/or response to palliative treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents. Patients who have&#xD;
             received other investigational agents previously who are no longer receiving these&#xD;
             investigational agents may be eligible at the discretion of the PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with complicated bone metastases, defined as having at least one or more of&#xD;
             the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Nerve root compression&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Prior radiation to the spinal cord at that bone level&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Impending (score of 9 or more on Mirel's Criteria) or existing pathologic&#xD;
                  fracture&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. Patients who have been previously radiated to the primary anatomic site for which they&#xD;
             are being considered for this trial, or have had surgical fixation of the site.&#xD;
             However, patients may have undergone previous courses of radiotherapy to a primary&#xD;
             site or separate site of metastatic disease if in the opinion of the investigator the&#xD;
             patient will be able to tolerate palliative RT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Pregnant women are excluded from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Life expectancy of under 3 months in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Liquid malignancies, including myeloma, lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Judgment by the investigator that the patient is unsuitable to participate in the&#xD;
             study or the patient is unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions and&#xD;
             requirements.&#xD;
