  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being performed to characterize the rowing stroke in active and inactive&#xD;
      individuals who use a manual wheelchair. We will be looking at muscle activity of four&#xD;
      shoulder muscles (upper trapezius, lower trapezius, serratus anterior, and posterior deltoid)&#xD;
      and motion of the arms, shoulder blade, and trunk during rowing. This will be done for three&#xD;
      rowing conditions (1: adapted rowing ergometer, 2: rowing ergometer from a chair, 3: standard&#xD;
      seated row exercise using an elastic band [TheraBand]). We are also looking at shoulder&#xD;
      strength, range of motion, quality of life, and community participation.&#xD;

      Individuals who use a manual wheelchair (MWC) are at a high risk of developing long-term&#xD;
      shoulder pain and impairment caused by increased demand and load on the shoulder during&#xD;
      normal daily activities. Two main contributors to shoulder pain are overuse and shoulder&#xD;
      muscle imbalance. Rehabilitation programs targeting shoulder pain suggest stretching anterior&#xD;
      shoulder muscles and strengthening posterior shoulder muscles to promote balance and&#xD;
      stability across the shoulder. Rowing-type exercises have been shown to be beneficial in&#xD;
      accomplishing this. In addition to reducing shoulder pain, it is crucial to identify methods&#xD;
      and modes of exercise which are more widely accessible. Participation in physical activity&#xD;
      provides physical, psychological, and social benefits. However, several barriers to physical&#xD;
      activity have been reported in this population. Less than half of individuals with physical&#xD;
      disabilities meet the American College of Sports Medicine's physical activity guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is to determine the biomechanics of the rowing stroke in active&#xD;
      and inactive individuals who use a MWC for mobility. Muscle activity (electromyography) of&#xD;
      four shoulder muscles (upper trapezius, lower trapezius, serratus anterior, and posterior&#xD;
      deltoid) and 3D motion analysis of the arms, shoulder blade, and trunk will be analyzed&#xD;
      across three rowing conditions (adapted rowing ergometer, rowing ergometer from chair,&#xD;
      standard row exercise). We hypothesize rowing on the adapted rowing ergometer will lead to&#xD;
      greater muscle activity than the standard rowing exercise and there will be no difference in&#xD;
      arm, shoulder blade, and trunk movement between rowing conditions. The secondary aim of this&#xD;
      study is to assess shoulder range of motion, pectoralis minor muscle extensibility, quality&#xD;
      of life, and community participation. We hypothesize active individuals will have a greater&#xD;
      range of motion and pectoralis minor muscle extensibility and report lower quality of life&#xD;
      and community participation than inactive individuals. This study seeks to lay the groundwork&#xD;
      of evidence to suggest participation in rowing as a viable option to reduce the frequency and&#xD;
      intensity of shoulder pain and provide a more accessible form of physical activity.&#xD;
      Additionally, we hope to contribute further insight into clinical measures (shoulder&#xD;
      strength, range of motion, pectoralis minor muscle extensibility), subjective quality of&#xD;
      life, and community participation in this population.&#xD;

    <description>Surface EMG will be used to determine levels of muscle activation through analyzing area under the curve, peak, and mean amplitude. Data will be collected on four muscles bilaterally (upper trapezius, lower trapezius, serratus anterior, and posterior deltoid).Peak dynamic method will be used for normalization for comparison between exercise conditions.(Ryan et al., 1992; Fleming &amp; Donne, 2014; Hug &amp; Dorel, 2009)</description>

    <measure>Kinematics</measure>
    <time_frame>Collected during Day 2 visit</time_frame>
    <description>Three-dimensional kinematic data of the trunk, arms, and scapula will be collected using the Motion Monitor electromagnetic transmitter system (Innovative Sports Training, Inc., Chicago, IL). The International Society of Biomechanics recommendations for shoulder kinematics, will be used to define sensor placement and global and local coordinate system definitions.(Wu et al., 2005) Using this data, we will analyze the coordination and symmetry of the upper extremity during the rowing stroke to supplement the EMG data.</description>

    <measure>Shoulder Muscle Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Collected during Day 1 visit</time_frame>
    <description>Shoulder girdle strength will be measured bilaterally using a handheld dynamometer (HHD) (Lafayette Manual Muscle Tester, Lafayette, IN). Flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, internal, and external rotation strength will be measured. Standard manual muscle testing positions, as previously described by Kendall et al., 2005 will be used with a modification to allow participants to remain in their wheelchairs during testing. Peak force, measured in kilograms (kg), will be normalized to body weight (BW) for comparison across participants [%BW=(forcekg/BWkg)*100].</description>

    <measure>Shoulder Range of Motion</measure>
    <time_frame>Collected during Day 1 visit</time_frame>
    <description>Active shoulder ROM will be measured bilaterally for elevation, extension, external rotation (humerus in 90Â° elevation), and internal rotation. ROM will be measured using goniometer and analyzed using the maximum value recorded over two trials.</description>

    <time_frame>Collected During Day 1 visit</time_frame>
    <description>The SQoL is a self-report questionnaire measuring the individual's overall perception of their quality of life. The SQoL consists of one question asking individuals to rate their overall quality of life taking everything into account. The question is measured using a Likert-type scale where 1 = life is very distressing, it's hard to imagine how it could get much worse; to 7 = life is great, it's hard to imagine how it could get much better.(Dijkers, 2005)</description>

    <measure>Community Participation</measure>
    <time_frame>Collected during Day 1 visit</time_frame>
    <description>The Community Participation Indicators' Enfranchisement Scale (CPI) will be used to measure community participation. The CPI is a 48-question self-report questionnaire measuring two domains of community participation, importance of participation and control over participation.(Heinemann et al., 2013) Questions are answered by selecting one of five options: &quot;all the time, frequently, sometimes, seldom, and almost never&quot;. The score is broken down by domain and scores range from 0 to 100 for each domain. A higher score is indicative of greater participation.</description>
