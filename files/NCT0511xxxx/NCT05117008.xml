    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter phase II, open-label study evaluating the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      belantamab mafodotin maintenance in participants with relapsed and/or refractory multiple&#xD;
      myeloma (RRMM) who have received commercially available anti-BCMA CAR-T-cell therapy.&#xD;
      Subjects will be enrolled 60-130 days after chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy (CAR-T)&#xD;
      and receive belantamab mafodotin as maintenance therapy. Each maintenance cycle will have a&#xD;
      duration of 56 days (+/- three days) and belantamab mafodotin will be administered at a dose&#xD;
      of 2.5 mg/kg IV on day 1 of each cycle.&#xD;

      INTERVENTION DESCRIPTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive belantamab mafodotin as maintenance therapy. Belantamab mafodotin will&#xD;
      be administered IV over approximately 30 minutes at the recommended dose of 2.5 mg/kg IV over&#xD;
      30 minutes on day 1 of every eight-week (+/- three days) cycle for a maximum of 12 cycles.&#xD;
      Maintenance therapy with belantamab mafodotin will continue until progressive disease (PD),&#xD;
      death, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent or end of study (maximum of 12 cycles),&#xD;
      whichever occurs first. Dose interruptions or reductions may be required to address potential&#xD;
      drug-associated toxicities. The dose to be administered will be based on actual body weight&#xD;
      calculated at baseline. However, if the change in body weight is greater than 10%, the dose&#xD;
      will be recalculated based on the actual body weight at the time of dosing. The dose may be&#xD;
      reduced to address toxicity.&#xD;
