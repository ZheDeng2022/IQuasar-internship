  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early childhood caries is a persistent problem often leading to dental treatment under&#xD;
      general anaesthesia (GA). Thus, this study was to investigate the preventive effect of two&#xD;
      additional intensive oral hygiene appointments before and after general anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this randomized, controlled clinical trial, 408 children (age 2-5 years, mean 4.2+-1.04)&#xD;
      intended for general anaesthesia were recruited and randomly assigned to the intervention and&#xD;
      control groups with or without two additional intensive oral hygiene appointments before and&#xD;
      after the general anaesthesia. At baseline and at 6-/12-month follow-ups, Approximal Plaque&#xD;
      Index (API), gingiva Sulcus Bleeding Index (SBI), caries and initial caries index: initial,&#xD;
      decayed, missing, filled, teeth (idmft) were recorded.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Early Childhood Caries (ECC) is considered to be a global problem, as it is one of the most&#xD;
      prevalent diseases in childhood. This leads to a severe problem in the caries risk children&#xD;
      being highly affected by ECC, mostly also non-cooperative and from lower socio-economic&#xD;
      background. The dental treatment for these pre-school children often requires general&#xD;
      anaesthesia (GA), which is associated with health risks and considerable costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, this study was to investigate the preventive effect of two additional intensive oral&#xD;
      hygiene appointments before and after general anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After approval by the Ethics Committee at the University of Greifswald (No. BB 078/17),&#xD;
      children with an age range from 2 to 5 years assigned for dental treatment under general&#xD;
      anaesthesia were recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining informed consent from the parents, the participants were randomly allocated&#xD;
      to the test and control groups by a computer-generated random sequence prepared by a&#xD;
      statistician, blinded to the recruiting person. Both groups received a baseline examination&#xD;
      and the standard preventive program offered within the German National Health System&#xD;
      consisting of explaining the etiology of caries and preventive approaches such as practical&#xD;
      training of the parents in tooth brushing in their child as well as recommending fluoridated&#xD;
      toothpaste and a reduction of cariogenic snacks. Finally fluoride varnish was applied. The&#xD;
      test group received two additional preventive sessions including oral hygiene instructions&#xD;
      using plaque disclosing agent, toothbrushing and fluoride application, one week before the&#xD;
      date of the general anaesthesia treatment and at the control visit about a week after the&#xD;
      general anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The baseline and follow-up examinations at 6 and 12 months recorded caries, fillings and&#xD;
      missing teeth due to caries according to the World Health Organisation (WHO) criteria and it&#xD;
      included initial caries lesions according to International Caries Detection and Assessment&#xD;
      System (ICDAS 1-3). The subcomponents were also added up as initial, decayed, missing,&#xD;
      filled, teeth/surfaces (idmft/idmfs). Due to the young age of the children, only primary&#xD;
      teeth were of relevance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the Approximal Plaque Index (API) and the gingiva Sulcus Bleeding Index (SBI)&#xD;
      were taken. The examiners were blinded regarding the group status of the children, as other&#xD;
      practice personal had to perform the preventive sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation and statistical analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected difference in new caries lesions between test and control groups was taken as an&#xD;
      outcome parameter for sample size calculation. Previous regional studies had shown a mean&#xD;
      caries development of 2 +-1.5 per year after the general anaesthesia. An intensive prevention&#xD;
      program may result in a caries reduction of 30%, corresponding to 0.5-0.6 dmft less in the&#xD;
      test group. With α being 0.05 and a power β of 0.80, 142 children were needed in each group,&#xD;
      with a drop-out of 30% (62 children) this would mean a total sample size of 408 children at&#xD;
      baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collected data were entered in Excel (Microsoft, USA), then transferred to Stata (Version&#xD;
      14.2; Stata Corp, College Station, USA) for further statistical analysis. Due to the large&#xD;
      sample size and the randomization matching or data linkage analysis were not required, but a&#xD;
      drop-out analysis was carried out to exclude a bias caused by attrition within the study. A&#xD;
      modelling of continuous variables was carried out using restricted cubic splines. Mixed&#xD;
      models were used for adjusting the analyses of changes within every group between baseline&#xD;
      and recalls and between the two groups. Linear models were used for calculating the absolute&#xD;
      effect and ordinal logistic regression for calculating the relative effect via odds ratios.&#xD;
