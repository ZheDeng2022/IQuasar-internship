    <textblock>
      Thyroidectomy is the procedure by which surgeons treat various thyroid diseases and is&#xD;
      considered the commonest endocrinal surgery. Yet, it carries a risk for intraoperative&#xD;
      complications. The most distressing complications are recurrent laryngeal nerve and&#xD;
      parathyroid injuries. Methylene blue spray is a technique than can be used for easy&#xD;
      identification of both recurrent laryngeal nerve and parathyroid glands so we can avoid their&#xD;
      injuries.&#xD;

      Thyroid disorders constitute the second most common endocrine disease following diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus. Thyroid surgery is one of the most frequently operated Head and Neck surgeries.&#xD;
      Post-thyroidectomy complications are not uncommon. Parathyroids and Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve&#xD;
      (RLN) are two of the complications of thyroidectomy that cause significant postoperative&#xD;
      morbidity Due to the advances in thyroids surgeries, the occurrence of postoperative&#xD;
      complications has been decreased, but when occurred, they cause lifelong handicap. The most&#xD;
      important complications encountered are injury to the RLN and parathyroids. Meticulous&#xD;
      dissection is a key factor in minimizing the occurrence of complications During&#xD;
      thyroidectomy, careful dissection can protect the parathyroid glands and RLN. Various methods&#xD;
      were used including capsular dissection, attention to protection of the arterial supply to&#xD;
      parathyroids, avoiding unnecessary manipulation in the area of RLN Methylene blue spraying is&#xD;
      a new technique that allows identification of both parathyroid glands and recurrent laryngeal&#xD;
      nerves&#xD;

    <description>After ligation of the middle thyroid vein and the upper pole of the thyroid, the thyroid lobe was retracted medially and diluted methylene blue (0.5 ml methylene blue 2% was diluted by 5ml normal saline) was sprayed over the lower thyroid pole and the perilobar area. This area contains structures including recurrent laryngeal nerve, parathyroid glands, and inferior thyroid vessels which were observed After spraying.&#xD;
The vocal cord mobility was assessed intraoperatively by the anesthesiologist at time of extubation. The serum calcium was measured on the 2nd postoperative day. There was no routine use of postoperative calcium supplementation. Hypocalcemia was defined when the serum calcium level was less than 8 mg/dl.</description>
