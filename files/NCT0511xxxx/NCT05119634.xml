  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COVID - 19 is an infectious disease caused by sars-CoV-2 that mainly affects the respiratory&#xD;
      system. Most people experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without&#xD;
      special treatment. However, the need for hospitalization and mechanical ventilation is also&#xD;
      quite high. Symptoms such as respiratory failure, dry cough, dyspnea, fatigue, weakness after&#xD;
      exertion, headache, stress, depression, insomnia are frequently seen and require&#xD;
      rehabilitation. Appropriate and tailored exercise stands as a promising, effective treatment&#xD;
      to alleviate post-COVID-19 symptoms and help people recover faster and improve their&#xD;
      autonomy, functionality and quality of life. In this context, Whole Body Vibration Training,&#xD;
      which has been successfully applied to treat symptoms in many diseases such as COPD, can be&#xD;
      used. Our study also aims to examine the effect of Whole Body Vibration Training in post&#xD;
      COVID-19 patients. For this purpose, post COVID - 19 (≥12 weeks) patients aged 18 and over&#xD;
      who applied to Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty, Department of Chest Diseases will be recruited.&#xD;
      Lack of clinical stability, active respiratory infection, any clinical condition that&#xD;
      interferes with the performance of working procedures, advanced cancer, active infectious&#xD;
      disease, pregnancy or breastfeeding, osteoarticular pathology that reduces mobility, severe&#xD;
      neurological disease (Parkinson's disease, dementia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, aphasia,&#xD;

      limit exercise tolerance (heart failure, patients with abnormal blood pressure responses or&#xD;
      ST segment depression &gt; 2mm, symptomatic aortic stenosis, complex arrhythmias), acute&#xD;
      thromboembolism, recent upper abdominal or thoracic surgery (≤ 3 months) will not be included&#xD;
      in the study. This study will be a double blind randomized controlled trial. Another clinican&#xD;
      will coach patients and the researcher will have no idea about groups. There will be two&#xD;
      groups in the study. Vibration at 25-40 Hz (with a total of 15-30 minutes and ≥3 minutes rest&#xD;
      periods) will be applied to the case group 3 days a week for 8 weeks. The control group will&#xD;
      do the determined exercises as a home based program. In this study, respiratory functions&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>6 minutes pegboard and ring test</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The 6PBRT is a simple, inexpensive test that evaluates both arm function and endurance. the participants moved 10 lightweight wooden rings each of the lower pegs to the upper pegs using both hands simultaneously during 6 minutes. Paticipants are asked to sit straight in a chair and a pegboard with multiple peg positions is placed in front of the subject at arm's length from the body. The final score is the total number of rings moved during the 6-minute period. Participants are permitted to stop and rest during the test if they feel severe dyspnea, fatigue, or other discomfort, and continue moving the pegs as soon as they can. Subjects are asked to score the perceived dyspnea and fatigue after the test by the Borg scale. Each subject performe the PBRT twice. A pulse oximeter is used to monitor heart rate (HR) and arterial oxygen saturation (Sao2), and measure blood pressure (BP).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>International Physical Activity Form (IPAQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) is a commonly used physical activity questionnaire that assesses the amount and intensity of physical activity in daily living. The questionnaire comprises nine items to assess the level of physical activity (PA) at moderate (4 metabolic equivalent task, METS) and vigorous intensities (8 METS), walking (3.3 METS), and sitting times. The score of overall PA will be calculated in (MET)-min/week units, which is the sum of each mode of activity multiplied by the constant level of energy (MET) required for the task, as described above, by number of minutes will be performed per day, and by the amount of time performed per week. Based on questionnaire's manual, 600 METS-min/week (150 min/week * 4METS of moderate intensity PA) is considered a threshold for meeting the general PA recommendation</description>

    <measure>peripheral muscle strength measurement</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Quadriceps femoris and biceps brachii isometric muscle strength will be measured by portable hand dynamometer (JTECH, Medical Commander Powertrack II, USA). Isometric muscle strength of Quadriceps femoris and biceps brachii is measured by portable hand dynamometer. Quadriceps femoris muscle force is measured in sitting position, at knee extension, and biceps brachii muscle strength at backrest position, while elbow is flexed. For handgrip strength test, we wiil use a JAMAR dynamometer. Hand grip strength will be measured in an upright position, shoulder adduction, elbow 90° flexion, and wrist with thumb facing up. The measurements are repeated three times in succession and the average is recorded.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Chalder Fatigue Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue will be assessed using the Chalder fatigue scale (CFQ-11). It contains 11 items on an ordinal 0 to 3 scale, which are summed to a total score (range 0-33; 33 denotes maximal symptoms) and two subscales: physical fatigue (seven items, range 0-21) and mental fatigue (four items, range 0-12). The CFQ-11 also has an alternative scoring algorithm, bimodal scoring, where each item response is dichotomized; 0 (0 to 1) or 1 (2 to 3) and summed to a 0-11 scale. Conventionally, fatigue case-status (fatigued vs. non-fatigued) is defined using this scale with a cut-off at &lt;4 vs. ≥4</description>

    <measure>EuroQol- 5 Dimension</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D is a validated, generic, preference-based, health-status measure consisting of five descriptive questions concerning five domains of HRQoL (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/ depression). Each question is answered with one of the three potential responses as follows: (1) 'no problems', (2) 'moderate problems' and (3) 'severe problems.' An index score ranging from -0.59 to 1 is calculated from the 5 dimensions of the scale. In the score function, a value of 0 indicates death, a value of 1 indicates perfect health, while negative values indicate conditions such as unconsciousness and being confined to a bed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is a brief and widely used instrument to measure psychological distress. It provides a HADS-depression (HADS-D) and a HADS-anxiety (HADS-A) score. Both total scores range from 0 to 21. At the end of the validity study conducted in Turkey, the cut-off score for the anxiety subscale was found to be 10/11 and 7/8 for the depression subscale. Accordingly, those who score above these points are considered as a risk group.</description>

    <measure>Impact of Events Scale (IES-R)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The scale consists of 22 items that measure the subjective stress levels of individuals exposed to traumatic life events. Each item is evaluated on a 5-point Likert-type scale (0 = Never, 4 = Always). The scale consists of three subscales: hyperarousal, avoidance, and intrusion. The IES-R subscores were categorized as normal (0-23 IES-R points), mild (24-32 IES-R points), moderate (33-36 IES-R points), and severe psychological impact of events (&gt;37 IES-R points).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PSQI allows evaluating the quality and disturbances of sleep over one month. The questionnaire consists of 19 self-assessed questions that are categorized into 7 components: 1) sleep quality, 2) sleep latency, 3) sleep duration, 4) sleep efficiency, 5) sleep disorders, 6) medication use to sleep, and 7) daytime sleepiness. Each component is classified in a score ranging from 0 to 3. The sum of the scores for these 7 components produces a score ranging from 0 to 21. It presents a cutoff point where it considers good sleep quality if PSQI≤5 and poor sleep quality if PSQI&gt;5</description>

    <measure>pulmonary function test</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The pulmonary function test (PFT) will be performed with a portable spirometry device (Spirobank II) with the nose closed and at least three times in the sitting position. After the nose is tightened with a latch, the person breathes normally on the spirometer. After a few normal inspirations and expirations, it is desirable to take a deep breath at the end of the expiration at the level of rest, and to release the air slowly and continuously afterwards. With this application, the volumes and capacities outside the residual volume (RV), functional residual capacity (FRC) and total lung capacity (TLC) are calculated.</description>

    <measure>Charlson Comorbidity Index</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It was developed by M. E. Charlson in 1987 for the long-term prognosis of patients. The Charlson comorbidity index has been a useful tool for researchers in studies of measuring comorbidity in health databases. 19 comorbid diseases are scored based on the relative risk of one-year mortality. The patient's age is then added to the comorbidity score. In conclusion, the index score sum has been shown to be an indicator of disease burden and useful in predicting mortality for COVID-19 patients.</description>
