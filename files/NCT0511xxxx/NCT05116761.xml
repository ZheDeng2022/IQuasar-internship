          5. Must be between 4 to 20 weeks since onset of acute COVID-19 symptoms onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. No return to baseline health or hiatus between acute COVID-19 and onset of post-acute&#xD;
             COVID-19 or chronic post-COVID-19 syndrome.&#xD;

          7. Current SARS-CoV-2 RT PCR must be negative prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. At least 2 or more persistent symptoms frequently reported for post-acute COVID-19 or&#xD;
             chronic post-COVID-19 syndrome such as fatigue, cough, headache, body aches, fever,&#xD;
             chills, loss of taste, loss of smell, diarrhea, congestion, dyspnea, sore throat,&#xD;
             chest pain, abdominal pain, confusion, or vomiting must be moderate in severity based&#xD;
             on modified CDC Symptoms Questionnaire (See Section 11.1 for severity scoring system).&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
         10. Baseline EQ-5D-5L must be higher than 21211. (Of note: EQ-5D-5L has 5 dimensions:&#xD;
             mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression. Each&#xD;
             dimension is scored from 1 (full) to 5 (worst), such that a score of 11111 is&#xD;
             reflective of full quality-of-life and a score of 55555 is reflective of worst&#xD;
             quality-of-life.)&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Baseline 6-Minute Walk Test (6-MWT) is 500 meters or less.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Supplemental oxygen should be ≤5 L O2/min.&#xD;
&#xD;

          5. Depression as screened by positive Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ2) and confirmed&#xD;
             as moderate or higher severity on PHQ9 (See Appendix 11.5). Of note, subjects found to&#xD;
