  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intestinal obstruction is a common clinical problem that occurs secondary to mechanical or&#xD;
      functional obstruction of the intestine, preventing normal transit of its contents. It is a&#xD;
      frequent cause of hospitalization and represents 15-20% of surgical admissions for acute&#xD;
      abdominal pain .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The underlying aetiology of large bowel obstructions (LBOs) is age dependent, but in&#xD;
      adulthood, the most common cause is colonic cancer (50-60%), typically in the sigmoid. The&#xD;
      second most common cause in adults is acute diverticulitis (involving the sigmoid colon).&#xD;
      Together, obstructing tumors and acute diverticulitis account for 90% of all causes of LBO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adhesions are the most common cause of small bowel obstruction (SBO) , For practical&#xD;
      purposes, they do not tend to cause LBO.Other causes which cause symptoms that are mimic&#xD;
      intestinal obstruction as in bowel ischemia that mainly caused by mesenteric vessels&#xD;
      occlusion (adynamic obstruction).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Computed tomography (CT) has become a mainstay in diagnosing bowel obstruction. This is&#xD;
      because the management of obstruction has dramatically changed with a decrease in the&#xD;
      proportion of patients who need surgery Multi Detector Computed Tomography scanners provide a&#xD;
      huge gain in performance that can be used to reduce the scan time, reduce section&#xD;
      collimation, or to increase scan length surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis of intestinal obstruction is established by patient history and clinical findings&#xD;
      include abdominal distension, acute abdominal pain, vomiting and inability to pass stools or&#xD;
      flatus .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of CT in diagnosing intestinal obstruction has been expanding by determining&#xD;
      presence, degree, level and cause (extrinsic lesions, intrinsic lesions, intussusception,&#xD;
      intraluminal lesions) of obstruction and in identifying any associated strangulation, and&#xD;
      also it has an important role in diagnosing the mesenteric vessels obstruction by thrombi by&#xD;
      injection of IV contrast media which causes adynamic bowel obstruction .&#xD;
