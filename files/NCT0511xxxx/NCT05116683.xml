  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a new investigational drug,&#xD;
      ATX-101, for the treatment of dedifferentiated liposarcoma (LPS) and leiomyosarcoma (LMS).&#xD;
      ATX-101 is an intravenous (IV) drug which blocks the interaction of a protein called PCNA&#xD;
      with a number of &quot;stress response&quot; proteins. These interactions are thought to be important&#xD;
      for cancer cell survival and growth. ATX-101 may disrupt these interactions and therefore&#xD;
      help treat the cancer. In this study, all patients will receive the same treatment. Most of&#xD;
      the exams, tests, and procedures are part of the usual approach to medical care for this&#xD;
      condition. However, some additional tests or procedures may be performed, and other tests may&#xD;
      be performed more frequently than usual.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ATX-101 is a small molecule peptide comprised of a novel human proliferating cell nuclear&#xD;
      antigen (PCNA) interacting motif termed APIM coupled to cellular and nuclear delivery&#xD;
      domains. PCNA interacts with many cellular proteins and exerts pleiotropic effects in the&#xD;
      cancer cell. Proteins that bind to PCNA via APIM are especially important in the cellular&#xD;
      stress and DNA damage responses, as well as intracellular signaling, apoptosis, metabolism&#xD;
      and anti-tumor immunity. In preclinical studies, ATX-101 demonstrated single-agent activity&#xD;
      and potentiated other cytotoxic and targeted agents across multiple cancer models in vitro&#xD;
      and in vivo, including LMS and LPS. ATX-101 is currently being evaluated in a phase 1 safety&#xD;
      and pharmacokinetic study in solid tumors using a 3 + 3 dose escalation design. As of&#xD;
      10/29/2020, ATX-101 has been evaluated across dose levels of 20 mg/m2 - 60 mg/m2 IV weekly.&#xD;
      Although no maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was reached, after review of the available safety&#xD;
      data, the RP2D was determined to be 60 mg/m2 IV weekly, with no plans to dose escalate&#xD;
      further. ATX-101 has been well tolerated, with no grade 3 or higher adverse events (AEs)&#xD;
      observed during the phase 1 study. Common AEs include grade 1/2 infusion related reactions&#xD;
      (which have been easily managed with supportive care), mild fatigue and diarrhea. In this&#xD;
      study, ATX-101 demonstrated encouraging activity as prolonged disease stabilization in&#xD;
      patients with progressive, heavily pre-treated malignancies.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed dedifferentiated liposarcoma (LPS) or leiomyosarcoma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ATX-101 in Sarcoma Phase II&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  (LMS). Pathology review occurs at the center enrolling the patient on this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Disease must be locally advanced and unresectable or metastatic. Disease which may be&#xD;
             resected but with an associated level of morbidity deemed unacceptable by the treating&#xD;
             clinician is considered eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable disease by RECIST criteria version 1.1. In addition, the&#xD;
             first 10 patients enrolled on the study must have a site of disease amenable to&#xD;
             image-guided biopsy at minimal risk or less, and must agree to undergo this biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must evidence of disease progression, either clinically or radiographically,&#xD;
             within the 12 weeks prior to study enrollment, as determined by the investigator&#xD;
             enrolling the patient on the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have been treated with at least one prior systemic regimen for advanced&#xD;
             sarcoma: LMS: Anthracycline-based chemotherapy, or gemcitabine/docetaxel. LPS: No&#xD;
             specification as to the prior treatment received. Neoadjuvant or adjuvant systemic&#xD;
             therapy does not qualify as prior treatment unless completed within 6 months of&#xD;
             disease relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be age 18 years or older. Because the safety of ATX-101 in patients less&#xD;
             than 18 years of age has not been characterized, children are excluded from the&#xD;
             present study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must demonstrate an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance&#xD;
             status of ≤2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must demonstrate normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,500/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Creatinine ≤ 1.5 times upper limit of normal OR&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Calculated creatinine clearance &gt; 45 mL/min*&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times upper limit of normal**&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aspartate transaminase (AST)/aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 1.5 times upper limit of&#xD;
             normal**&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Notes: Upper limit of normal is defined by the clinical laboratory performing the&#xD;
             test.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Using the lean body mass formula only (Modified Cockcroft Gault) ** If transaminase&#xD;
             elevation and/or bilirubin elevation is attributed to the presence of liver&#xD;
             metastases, a total bilirubin ≤ 2.5 times the upper limit of normal and an AST and ALT&#xD;
             ≤ 2.5 times the upper limit of normal are permissible. Patients with an elevated&#xD;
             bilirubin level that is attributed to an inherited disorder, such as Gilbert's&#xD;
             disease, may be enrolled at the discretion of the principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of ATX-101 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason,&#xD;
             women of child-bearing potential and all men must agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             (for women: hormonal or barrier method of birth control, abstinence; for men: male&#xD;
             condom, prior vasectomy, or abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of&#xD;
             study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while&#xD;
             she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating&#xD;
             physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use&#xD;
             adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation,&#xD;
             and 4 months after completion of ATX-101 administration. If patients do not agree to&#xD;
             the above, they are not considered eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have received treatment with any chemotherapy, immunotherapy,&#xD;
             radiotherapy or an investigational agent for malignancy within the 21 days of&#xD;
             initiating treatment on this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not have received treatment with a small molecule targeted agent&#xD;
             (including off-label or investigational use) within 14 days of initiating treatment on&#xD;
             this protocol, provided this represents at least 7 half-lives for that agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Toxic effects from any prior therapy (except alopecia) must have resolved to grade 1&#xD;
             or less according to NCI CTCAE v4.0 or to the patient's baseline by the time of&#xD;
             initiating treatment on this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not have uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to,&#xD;
             ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina&#xD;
             pectoris, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, cerebrovascular accident within the last&#xD;
             six months, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, uncontrolled psychiatric illness or any&#xD;
             other disease condition that would limit compliance with study requirements in the&#xD;
             opinion of the principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not be pregnant or nursing. Pregnant women are excluded from this study&#xD;
             because the teratogenic effects of ATX-101 have not been adequately studied. A&#xD;
             negative pregnancy test must be documented 7 days or less prior to initiating&#xD;
             treatment on this protocol. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse&#xD;
             events to nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with ATX-101,&#xD;
             breastfeeding must be discontinued prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not have known active hepatitis B or C infection. In patients with a&#xD;
             history of hepatitis B or C infection, resolution of infection must be demonstrated by&#xD;
             negative serology for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and/or negative hepatitis C&#xD;
             virus (HCV) RNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not have uncontrolled HIV/AIDS infection. However, HIV positive patients&#xD;
             on highly active retroviral therapy (HAART) with an undetectable viral load and CD4&#xD;
             T-cell count above 200 may participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anticipated requirement for surgery during the study period or major surgery within 3&#xD;
             weeks of initiating treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active central nervous system (CNS) metastases or leptomeningeal involvement. Patients&#xD;
             with known CNS metastases must have received definitive radiotherapy or surgery at&#xD;
             least 4 weeks prior to initiating treatment with imaging demonstrating no progression&#xD;
             of disease over this interval.&#xD;
