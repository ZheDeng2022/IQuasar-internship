  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cocoa beans are of major interest due to their various beneficial health effects, indicated&#xD;
      to be caused by its cocoa flavan-3-ols. (-)-Epicatechin is the most abundant flavan-3-ol in&#xD;
      these cocoa beans. Its metabolization in the colon results in bioactive valerolactone and&#xD;
      valeric acid metabolites and derivatives after phase II metabolism. Interindividual&#xD;
      differences in health effects following (-)-epicatechin consumption are observed, which are&#xD;
      suggested to be caused by large interindividual differences in bioavailable metabolite&#xD;
      concentrations. As the colonic microbiota is responsible for the metabolization of ~70% of&#xD;
      total (-)-epicatechin intake, and ~42% of total (-)-epicatechin intake leads to valerolactone&#xD;
      and valeric acid metabolites, it is hypothesized that the large interindividual variation in&#xD;
      microbial gut composition is responsible for the heterogeneity in metabolite concentration&#xD;
      and in its subsequent health effects. Furthermore, individuals can be stratified into two&#xD;
      pharmacotypes, slow and fast microbial metabolizers, which can produce metabolites at&#xD;
      different rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this single-arm study is to investigate if the microbial composition in the gut&#xD;
      determines the rate and extent of metabolization, following an acute consumption of about&#xD;
      160mg of pure (-)-epicatechin. The pharmacokinetics of the (-)-epicatechin metabolites will&#xD;
      be followed in plasma over 48h with a focus on the first fifteen hours and potentially in&#xD;
      urine over 24h. Valerolactone and valeric acid metabolite profiles in plasma and urine will&#xD;
      be obtained by Q-TOF-LC-MS. The microbial fingerprint of each individual will be obtained via&#xD;
      DNA extraction, flow cytometry and 16s rRNA sequencing of fecal samples.&#xD;

      The aim of this study is to investigate if the microbial composition in the gut can determine&#xD;
      the rate and extent of valerolactone and valeric acid production following an acute&#xD;
      consumption of 160mg of pure (-)-epicatechin. The gut microbial composition of each&#xD;
      participant will be linked with its metabolite plasma profile to investigate if the large&#xD;
      interindividual variation in metabolite formation can be explained by the variation in&#xD;
      microbial composition in the colon. This knowledge might contribute to a better understanding&#xD;
      of the correlation between epicatechin intake and its observed beneficial, but at the same&#xD;
      time very variable health effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This single-arm trial lasts a total of five days, with one day (day 3) on site at the&#xD;
      laboratory (UZ Ghent, Department of Rehabilitation Sciences). Two days prior to the test day,&#xD;
      subjects will be instructed to follow a low-flavan-3-ol diet for the next five days, until&#xD;
      48h after the supplement intake, to establish a low dietary background of flavan-3-ols. A&#xD;
      list of restrictions on foods and beverages rich in flavan-3-ols, such as chocolate, tea, red&#xD;
      wine and some fruit and vegetables, will be provided. Moreover, a standardized&#xD;
      flavan-3-ol-free meal and snack will be provided to consume the evening prior to the test&#xD;
      day, together with at least 0.5L of water. One day prior to the test day, each participant&#xD;
      will collect a stool sample for the determination of their microbial fingerprint. Stool&#xD;
      collection material will be provided to the subjects on beforehand. In addition, no strenuous&#xD;
      exercise can be performed on this day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the test day, participants arrive at the laboratory around 8am after an overnight fast of&#xD;
      minimum 8h and maximum 14h. This day lasts approximately 15h, until 11pm. First, a&#xD;
      questionnaire will be completed to evaluate compliance with the instructed diet and to check&#xD;
      the general well-being of the participants. Second, a medical doctor will insert a catheter&#xD;
      in the median cubital vein in the forearm, after which a first blood sample will be drawn.&#xD;
      Third, participants will be asked to empty the bladder, have breakfast and take the&#xD;
      epicatechin supplement within ten minutes after breakfast. Standardized flavan-3-ol-free&#xD;
      breakfast, lunch, dinner and three snacks will be offered at scheduled time points throughout&#xD;
      the day. Water is ad libitum with a minimum of 1.5L. Lastly, a food frequency questionnaire&#xD;
      will be completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each hour after supplement intake, venous blood will be drawn in vacutainers until fifteen&#xD;
      samples of 4mL are collected (0h-14h). On time points 0, 2, 6, 8 and 12h, additional blood&#xD;
      samples will be drawn in serum vacutainers. Urine will be pooled in three timeframes (0-6h,&#xD;
      6-12h and 12-24h). When all blood samples are collected, the catheter will be removed and a&#xD;
      questionnaire will be completed to evaluate the test day and well-being of the participants.&#xD;
      On each of the two following mornings (24h and 48h), one additional blood sample will be&#xD;
      taken after an overnight fast. The pooled urine (12-24h) will be collected 24h after&#xD;
      supplement intake. Some participants will also conduct this trial without the (-)-epicatechin&#xD;
      supplement to verify the effectiveness of the flavan-3-ol-free diet .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Valerolactone and valeric acid metabolite profiles will be obtained by Quadrupole Time of&#xD;
      Flight Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (Q-TOF-LC-MS). The microbial fingerprint of&#xD;
      each individual will be obtained via DNA extraction, flow cytometry and 16s rRNA sequencing&#xD;
      of fecal samples.&#xD;
