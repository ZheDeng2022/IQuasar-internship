  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inhaler nonadherence is a common problem that has been estimated to account for approximately&#xD;
      60% of all asthma-related hospitalizations. Unfortunately, prior interventions to improve&#xD;
      inhaler nonadherence have shown a lack of long-term success. This study proposes to assess&#xD;
      the problem of non-adherence using a D&amp;I research lens while testing a new inhaler approach&#xD;
      to potentially ameliorate the detrimental consequences of maintenance inhaler nonadherence.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are considered the essential foundation of most asthma&#xD;
      therapy, ICS inhaler non-adherence is a notoriously common problem and a significant cause of&#xD;
      asthma-related morbidity. Partially acknowledging the problem of non-adherence, international&#xD;
      organizations recently made paradigm-shifting recommendations that all patients with mild or&#xD;
      mild-to-moderate persistent asthma be considered for symptom-driven ICS-containing inhalers&#xD;
      rather than relying on adherence to traditional maintenance ICS inhalers and symptom-driven&#xD;
      beta-agonists. With this novel approach, asthma patients are at least exposed to the&#xD;
      important anti-inflammatory effects of ICS-containing inhalers when their inhaler is deployed&#xD;
      due to symptoms. The proposed study aims to (Aim 1) undertake a pragmatic pilot&#xD;
      randomized-controlled trial to evaluate if an inhaler strategy that utilizes symptom-driven&#xD;
      ICS inhalers is particularly accepted and beneficial in maintenance ICS inhaler non-adherent&#xD;
      asthma patients, and (Aim 2) use a D&amp;I science conceptual framework to better understand&#xD;
      patients' and providers' views of inhaler non-adherence. This study will use an electronic&#xD;
      sensor to monitor inhaler adherence and include semi-structured interviews using the&#xD;
      Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR).&#xD;
