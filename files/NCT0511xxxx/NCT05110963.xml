  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retention in care and persistent adherence to antiretroviral therapy are necessary for the&#xD;
      successful treatment of HIV infection. HIV-related stigma is a known impediment to the care&#xD;
      and health outcomes of people living with HIV. The proposed study will test theory-based&#xD;
      interventions designed to manage HIV stigma in order to improve care retention and medication&#xD;
      adherence in communities with high-levels of HIV-related stigma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducting a randomized test of a behavioral self-management intervention&#xD;
      designed to improve HIV treatment outcomes in people living with HIV in stigmatized contexts.&#xD;
      The trial includes a control arm and a non-stigma enhanced treatment adherence intervention&#xD;
      arm. Participants living in an economically under-resourced area of South Africa are&#xD;
      recruited through clinical care settings. The goal of the research is to examine whether&#xD;
      directly addressing HIV stigma and medication adherence management improves treatment&#xD;
      outcomes beyond those observed from a standard behavioral intervention without added&#xD;
      stigma-addressing components.&#xD;

    <measure>Medical Records of Care Appointments</measure>
    <time_frame>12-months</time_frame>
    <description>Medical records are retrospectively collected for all scheduled care visits and coded for whether the visits were attended.The records are exclusively from the clinic where patients are initially recruited and with patient permission. The data obtained are expressed as the ratio of the number of care appointments attended relative to the number scheduled.</description>

    <measure>Antiretroviral Medication Adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>12-months</time_frame>
    <description>Monthly unannounced phone assessments are used to conduct pill counts of antiretroviral medications. The pill counts are used to calculate the proportion of pills taken relative to the number of pills prescribed over a 30 day period.</description>
