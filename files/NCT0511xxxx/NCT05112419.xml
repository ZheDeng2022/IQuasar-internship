  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and tolerability of a single oral&#xD;
      dose of zibotentan in patients with moderate hepatic and moderate renal impairment in&#xD;
      comparison to a matched healthy control group.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-dose, non-randomised, open-label, parallel-group study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive a single oral dose of 5 mg zibotentan under fasted conditions&#xD;
      and will be involved in the study for approximately 5 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 12 participants will be enrolled into each one of the 2 cohorts and receive the&#xD;
      study intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1: 12 participants with moderate hepatic impairment and moderate renal impairment&#xD;
           as assessed at Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2: 12 healthy participants matched for age (± 10 years), gender, and BMI (± 20%)&#xD;
           on a group level to participants in Cohort 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will comprise of the following study periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Screening Period of maximum 28 days (before dosing): participants will be screened for&#xD;
           eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Residential Period of 8 days: participants will be admitted to the study centre in the&#xD;
           evening on Day&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2, two days before administration of a single oral dose of zibotentan (Day 1).&#xD;
           Participants will have final study assessments on Day 6 (120 hours post-dose) and will&#xD;
           be discharged that day.&#xD;
