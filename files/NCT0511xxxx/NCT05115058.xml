  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Presbyopia is physiological insufficiency of accommodation associated with the aging of the&#xD;
      eye that results in progressively worsening ability to focus clearly on close objects.Though&#xD;
      presbyopia is a normal change in our eyes as we age, it often is a significant and emotional&#xD;
      event because it's a sign of aging that's impossible to ignore and difficult to hide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This defect is usually corrected by using glasses with bifocal power of suitable focal&#xD;
      lengths.&#xD;
&#xD;
      But some patients don't want to use glasses for correction. In our study purpose is to show&#xD;
      that near vision improves and patient satisfaction increases by preparing an intrastromal&#xD;
      pocket for emmetropic patients with near vision problems using the SMILE module.&#xD;

      This study started at 2016 was performed in Eye Hospital Pristina in 82 eyes of 41 patients&#xD;
      aged (40-50) with the emmetropic presbyopic complaint.VisuMax femtosecond laser created the&#xD;
      stromal pocket with a diameter 7.60 mm and cap thickness set to 120 μm from corneal surface&#xD;
      and with a small opening - 2 mm superior incision at 90° and side cut angle 50°. The pocket&#xD;
      was dissected using a blunt spatula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients were followed up for one year with distance, intermediate, and near visual&#xD;
      acuity, slit lamp, corneal topography, anterior segment optical coherence tomography.&#xD;
      Uncorrected near visual acuity at 35 cm increased from J7 to J2 in 8 eyes operated on, from&#xD;
      J8 to J2 in 7 eyes, and from J6 to J2 in 6 eyes. Uncorrected intermediate visual acuity&#xD;
      ranged from J4 to J5 at 70 cm, and uncorrected distance visual acuity remained binocular at&#xD;
      20/20. The patients reported satisfaction while reading a book, looking at the phone, and&#xD;
      using a computer. No discomfort was observed from the lights while driving at night. We are&#xD;
      shaping the surface of the cornea via an introstrımal pocket. We are using the SMILE module&#xD;
      without removing the lenticule, and we are just separating the center of the cap from the top&#xD;
      of lenticule In the short term, we have observed increases in spherical aberrations of&#xD;
      patients. We also think that corneal shaping has an effect on the presbyopic correction. We&#xD;
      will see and analyze the long-term effects by observing them.&#xD;
