  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression and metabolic disorder (MetD) are two of the most common and debilitating&#xD;
      disorders worldwide, occurring with significant rates of comorbidity. This is a major&#xD;
      clinical challenge as the outcomes of both conditions are worsened. Studies have uncovered&#xD;
      that depression and metabolic disorder are associated with chronic, low-grade inflammation.&#xD;
      In brain circuit level, patients with depression are characterized with aberrant&#xD;
      frontostriatal (FS) circuit connectivity and reduced activity level that also associated with&#xD;
      metabolic comorbidity. In neurotransmitter level, the dopaminergic pathway, that could be&#xD;
      feedback regulated by immune and metabolic factors, has long been known to involve in&#xD;
      emotional and metabolic homeostasis. More importantly, this dopamine (DA) input is critical&#xD;
      to shaping the FS circuit-level dynamic connectivity and plasticity. Therefore, this study&#xD;
      hypothesizes that inflammatory and metabolic dysregulations on DA transmission link to the&#xD;
      aberrant FS function that cause mood and metabolic syndromes. To clarify the underlying&#xD;
      mechanisms, 90 patients who meet the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria of major depressive episode in&#xD;
      either major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder are planned to be recruit. FS functional&#xD;
      connectivity and activation, before and after receiving 10 Hz repetitive transcranial&#xD;
      magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex will be measured. Then&#xD;
      systemically analyze participants' clinical symptomology, neurocognitive function,&#xD;
      inflammation and metabolic status. Possible correlations between indices, the effects of rTMS&#xD;
      and differences between groups will be tested. Results could provide a chance for further&#xD;
      understanding the pathophysiology of depression with MetD and comparing between unipolar and&#xD;
      bipolar depression, and developing brain circuit based non-invasive brain stimulation&#xD;
      personalized treatment for depression with MetD to achieve a better outcome.&#xD;

      Depression and metabolic disorder (MetD) are two of the most common and debilitating&#xD;
      disorders worldwide, occurring with significant rates of comorbidity. This is a major&#xD;
      clinical challenge as the outcomes of both conditions are worsened. Studies have uncovered&#xD;
      that depression and metabolic disorder are associated with chronic, low-grade inflammation.&#xD;
      In brain circuit level, patients with depression are characterized with aberrant&#xD;
      frontostriatal (FS) circuit connectivity and reduced activity level that also associated with&#xD;
      metabolic comorbidity. BD patients also showed functional anomalies in the VS and FS circuits&#xD;
      with reduced neural flexibility of hedonic signaling in response to stress. The dysfunctional&#xD;
      FS circuits also link to the metabolic comorbidities in patients with mood disorders.&#xD;
      Regarding metabolic control, the FS functional connectivity changes affect food craving. And&#xD;
      the altered reciprocal loop from the medial prefrontal cortex could regulate eating behavior&#xD;
      and metabolic disturbance. In neurotransmitter level, the dopaminergic pathway, that could be&#xD;
      feedback regulated by immune and metabolic factors, has long been known to involve in&#xD;
      emotional and metabolic homeostasis. More importantly, this dopamine (DA) input is critical&#xD;
      to shaping the FS circuit-level dynamic connectivity and plasticity. Disruptions in the&#xD;
      dopamine (DA) system have been observed in psychiatric disorders. MDD might involve DA&#xD;
      reductions that could result from either diminished DA release from presynaptic neurons or&#xD;
      impaired signal transduction, either due to changes in receptor number or function and/or&#xD;
      altered intracellular signal processing. Therefore this study hypothesizes that inflammatory&#xD;
      and metabolic dysregulations on DA transmission link to the aberrant FS function that cause&#xD;
      depression and MetD. To clarify the underlying mechanisms, unipolar and bipolar depression&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled to measure the FS functional connectivity and activation, before&#xD;
      and after receiving 10 Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to left&#xD;
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Then systemically analyze participants' clinical&#xD;
      symptomology, neurocognitive function, inflammation and metabolic status. Possible&#xD;
      correlations between indices, the effects of rTMS and the possible differences between&#xD;
      unipolar and bipolar depression patients will be tested. Results could provide a chance for&#xD;
      further understanding the pathophysiology and better treatment of depression with MetD,&#xD;
      finding biomarkers for subgrouping depression between unipolar depression and bipolar&#xD;
      depression, predicting outcomes to brain circuit based personalized rTMS treatment for&#xD;
      depression with MetD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of the project are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To find the biological homogeneousness among depression with MetD by investigate the&#xD;
      associations between (1) FS circuit connectivity and clinical (mood and metabolic) symptoms,&#xD;
      and (2) FS circuit activation and clinical (mood and metabolic) symptoms in both unipolar and&#xD;
      bipolar depressed individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To confirm the role of FS in depression with MetD by applying rTMS to test its effects&#xD;
      on (1) clinical symptoms, (2) FS circuit activation, (3) FS circuit connectivity and (4) find&#xD;
      predictors for the rTMS treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To study the bidirectional inflammatory and metabolic feedback regulations of the DA&#xD;
      transmission in FS circuit in depression with MetD by investigate the associations between&#xD;
      (1) FS circuit activation, and (2) FS circuit connectivity and systemic inflammatory/&#xD;
      metabolic regulators both before and after rTMS treatments.&#xD;
