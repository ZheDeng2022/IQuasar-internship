  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aging is a natural process that is frequently accompanied by chronic physical or mental&#xD;
      health problems. Aging as well as a sedentary lifestyle behavior may produce identical&#xD;
      pathological and morphological changes. Saudi population, especially elderly people assume&#xD;
      sedentary lifestyle, with little physical activity is a strong predisposition for developing&#xD;
      a disability that adversely affects many aspects of physical and mental functions; mainly&#xD;
      mobility and the ability to perform the basic daily living activities (ADL); resulting&#xD;
      finally in increased risk of independence, loss of functionality, and falls. Type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus (T2DM) is a widespread chronic metabolic disorder, accounts for 90-95% of all&#xD;
      patients with diabetes. It is one of the most life-threatening public health challenges in&#xD;
      the world, characterized by long term complications that almost involves all systems of the&#xD;
      body. Polyneuropathy is the most common symptomatic complication in patients with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus, found in 50 to 60 % of patients over the age of sixty, with the impaired&#xD;
      glycemic control and deteriorated quality of life are among the most debilitating problems in&#xD;
      patients with diabetic polyneuropathy.&#xD;

      Regular physical activity is an important component in healthy aging. Regular activity is&#xD;
      very beneficial to our health as we age. Physical therapy can play an important role in the&#xD;
      evaluation and treatment of older people with gait and balance disorders. Physical Therapy&#xD;
      can help in the determination of the impairments produced by balance and gait abnormality and&#xD;
      develop individualized plans aiming for identification of functional limitations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lower extremity aerobic exercise training (e.g., walking, treadmill and bicycle ergometer) is&#xD;
      a good procedure to control and disrupt the progression of hyperglycemia in elderly with DPN.&#xD;
      Furthermore; it improves lower limb muscle oxygen uptake, enhances the nerve conduction and&#xD;
      proprioceptors sensitivity during activities. Lowe extremity aerobic exercise training can&#xD;
      enhance balance, thereby reducing the falling risk. Aerobic exercise is also helpful in&#xD;
      preventing age related lifestyle disease and improving quality of life (QOL) of the elderly.&#xD;
      A conflict was clearly evoked between prescribing weight bearing and non- weight bearing&#xD;
      exercise for elderly with diabetic polyneuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weight bearing theoretical basis assumes that weight bearing activities such as walking are&#xD;
      superior to other non- weight- bearing activities because of its ability to promote and&#xD;
      restore muscular strength, joint proprioception and range of motion necessary to effectively&#xD;
      perform typical daily activities. Although weight bearing training can significantly improve&#xD;
      walking and balance abilities in patients with diabetic polyneuropathy compared with non-&#xD;
      weight bearing training, but there were still not enough evidences to prove the ideal&#xD;
      percentage level of weight reduction or unloading during practicing lower extremity training&#xD;
      exercise in elderly with diabetic polyneuropathy. Quite recently, a new antigravity treadmill&#xD;
      based on The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) technology was introduced.&#xD;
      It permits low- load walking using an emerging technology called lower body positive pressure&#xD;
      (LBPP) to modify body weight during ambulation. Few trials handled the utilization of LBPP&#xD;
      technology and further trials are still warranted to to develop a more effective conservative&#xD;
      and intervention treatment protocol for enhancing physical activities, quality of life and&#xD;
      functional performance in elderly patients with diabetic polyneuropathy.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This interventional study aims to explore the effectiveness of the lower body positive pressure aerobic exercise training program on the glycemic control and the health-related quality of life in patients with diabetic polyneuropathy. Eighty eligible participants were randomly allocated to either group-A (0-percentage weight off-loading; 16-participants), group-B (25-percentage weight off-loading; 15-participants), group-C (50-percentage weight off-loading; 16-participants), group-D (75-percentage weight off-loading; 15-participants), and group-E (control group; 18-participants).&#xD;
Participants in the study groups received twelve-weeks mild to moderate intensity aerobic training program on the Alter-G anti-gravity treadmill.&#xD;
The Glycemic control (Fasting blood glucose in mg/dl, glycated hemoglobin, and health-related quality of life were evaluated at three time points: at the beginning of the study, after three months aerobic exercise training and three months post-training cessation.</intervention_model_description>
