      Prospective, multicenter, comparative, randomized placebo-controlled Phase III trial -&#xD;
      patients with hormone-naïve prostate cancer and pelvic lymph nodes metastases&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Standard of care for patients with prostate cancer (PC) with pelvic lymph nodes metastases is&#xD;
      radiotherapy (RT) with long-term androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). . Darolutamide improves&#xD;
      survival in men with castration-refractory non metastatic prostate cancer. We hypothesize&#xD;
      that adding Darolutamide to ADT and RT could improve FFS for these high-risk patients.&#xD;
