  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis&#xD;
      (UC), are caused by the loss of mucosal tolerance towards the commensal microbiota resulting&#xD;
      in inflammatory responses. Both CD and UC are difficult to manage clinically, and their&#xD;
      incidences are increasing worldwide especially in newly industrialized countries. The&#xD;
      etiology of these disorders is multifactorial, influenced by the complex interactions of&#xD;
      genes, the immune system, intestinal microbiota, and the external environment. Studies have&#xD;
      shown that there is a higher disease transmission rate from mothers with IBD than from&#xD;
      fathers. It is well established that IBD is also associated with perturbations of gut&#xD;
      microbiota composition. Early childhood is a golden age for microbiota manipulation to&#xD;
      prevent disease. Studying microbiota at this golden age also allow us to dissect the&#xD;
      development of a faulty microbiota and identify therapeutic targets to reverse it and cure&#xD;
      diseases that are already developed. New evidence suggests that the gastrointestinal tract of&#xD;
      new-borns becomes colonized with bacteria while in the womb, with the presence of different&#xD;
      microbes. The source of these microbes is of continued interest because the initial&#xD;
      intestinal colonization is believed to play a crucial role in the priming of the mucosal&#xD;
      immune system and may predispose to the development of immune-mediated diseases, such as IBD,&#xD;
      later in life. Overall, the microbiome structures in mother-babies across healthy and IBD&#xD;
      populations are largely underexplored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent study discovered a novel mechanism of vertically transmitted protection of the&#xD;
      new-born. The researchers found that bacteria in the mother's intestine during gestation can&#xD;
      drive later innate maturation of the neonatal gut in the absence of colonization, through the&#xD;
      transfer of specific bacterial metabolites to the foetus and via mother's milk. Study&#xD;
      demonstrated that the effects of the gut microbiota on postnatal immune maturation are not&#xD;
      simply due to colonization of the new-born after birth. Given the complexity of microbes&#xD;
      present in the gestational gut, it will be exciting to learn whether there are other modules&#xD;
      of priming induced by distinct microbes and their metabolites. Along these lines, it is&#xD;
      tempting to speculate that this transgenerational effect represents a predictive adaptive&#xD;
      response whereby mothers prepare the neonates for specific challenges that they are likely to&#xD;
      encounter based on gestational environmental cues, not only by microbial colonisation but&#xD;
      also by metabolite transfer. Meanwhile, it is unknown regarding whether there are&#xD;
      abnormalities in the metabolome as well as its mother-to-infant transfer in IBD. Those&#xD;
      results indicate that the metabolomic profiles are altered in IBD mother's breast milk, which&#xD;
      may transfer to infants and influence their development and health.&#xD;

      Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis&#xD;
      (UC), are caused by the loss of mucosal tolerance towards the commensal microbiota resulting&#xD;
      in inflammatory responses. Both CD and UC are difficult to manage clinically, and their&#xD;
      incidences are increasing worldwide especially in newly industrialized countries. The&#xD;
      etiology of these disorders is multifactorial, influenced by the complex interactions of&#xD;
      genes, the immune system, intestinal microbiota, and the external environment. Studies have&#xD;
      shown that there is a higher disease transmission rate from mothers with IBD than from&#xD;
      fathers.[47] It is well established that IBD is also associated with perturbations of gut&#xD;
      microbiota composition. Early childhood, when the microbiota is less mature and more&#xD;
      malleable, is a golden age for microbiota manipulation to prevent disease. Studying&#xD;
      microbiota at this golden age also allow us to dissect the development of a faulty microbiota&#xD;
      and identify therapeutic targets to reverse it and cure diseases that are already developed.&#xD;
      New evidence suggests that the gastrointestinal tract of new-borns becomes colonized with&#xD;
      bacteria while in the womb[1], with the presence of different microbes reported in amniotic&#xD;
      fluid[2, 3], umbilical cord blood[4], as well as placental and foetal membranes[5, 6]. The&#xD;
      source of these microbes is of continued interest because the initial intestinal colonization&#xD;
      is believed to play a crucial role in the priming of the mucosal immune system and may&#xD;
      predispose to the development of immune-mediated diseases, such as IBD, later in life[7]. Our&#xD;
      pilot study on several mother-baby samples showed that at the order level, Caudovirales&#xD;
      predominated in the viral communities of breast milk and meconium with relative abundance&#xD;
      above 95%. However, in the viral community of placenta, the Caudovirales only occupied&#xD;
      approximately 50%, concomitant with the emergence of eukaryotic viruses such as Ortervirles&#xD;
      (average 27.5%) and Herpesvirales (average 9.3%). Overall, the microbiome structures in&#xD;
      mother-babies across healthy and IBD populations are largely underexplored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent study discovered a novel mechanism of vertically transmitted protection of the&#xD;
      new-born. The researchers found that bacteria in the mother's intestine during gestation can&#xD;
      drive later innate maturation of the neonatal gut in the absence of colonization, through the&#xD;
      transfer of specific bacterial metabolites to the foetus and via mother's milk [8]. Gomez de&#xD;
      Agu ero et al. (2016) clearly demonstrated that the effects of the gut microbiota on&#xD;
      postnatal immune maturation are not simply due to colonization of the new-born after&#xD;
      birth[9]. They show this in a simplified model of gestational monocolonization with E. coli&#xD;
      whereby AhR ligands derived from this bacterium drive a distinct early postnatal intestinal&#xD;
      developmental program[9]. Given the complexity of microbes present in the gestational gut, it&#xD;
      will be exciting to learn whether there are other modules of priming induced by distinct&#xD;
      microbes and their metabolites. Along these lines, it is tempting to speculate that this&#xD;
      transgenerational effect represents a predictive adaptive response whereby mothers prepare&#xD;
      the neonates for specific challenges that they are likely to encounter based on gestational&#xD;
      environmental cues, not only by microbial colonisation but also by metabolite transfer.&#xD;
      Meanwhile, it is unknown regarding whether there are abnormalities in the metabolome as well&#xD;
      as its mother-to-infant transfer in IBD. To address this question, we began with a pilot&#xD;
      study on breast milk metablome profiling, employing untargeted metabolomics approach by&#xD;
      liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The results showed a total of 1,318&#xD;
      Negative-mode features and 1,418 Positive features discriminatory between IBD (4UC, 3 CD)&#xD;
      mothers and healthy mothers, indicative of broad metabolic differences between them. Those&#xD;
      significantly changed metabolites were involved in arginine and proline metabolism as well as&#xD;
      tyrosine metabolism according to pathway enrichment analysis. Those results indicate that the&#xD;
      metabolomic profiles are altered in IBD mother's breast milk, which may transfer to infants&#xD;
      and influence their development and health.&#xD;
