    <textblock>
      ZeroG is an FDA-listed robotic body weight support system (BWSS). Mounted on an overhead&#xD;
      track, patients are fitted in a harness system tethered to said track, and are able to&#xD;
      practice gait and balance activities without the risk of falling. This compensates for&#xD;
      ineffective postural control permitting intensive therapy sessions earlier in recovery. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to determine if inducing effective and safe balance perturbations&#xD;
      during standing and walking in the BWSS more effectively improve postural control than the&#xD;
      BWSS without perturbations. The target population are those patients in the post-acute phase&#xD;
      of stroke admitted for inpatient rehabilitation of balance impairments. Site investigators&#xD;
      and/or research staff will obtain names of potential subjects from internal reporting&#xD;
      identifying inpatients who may qualify for the study based on the inclusion criteria. Trained&#xD;
      site investigators will meet with potential subjects to explain the study, complete a&#xD;
      screening interview for exclusion and inclusion criteria, answer any questions, obtain&#xD;
      informed consent and HIPAA authorization, and schedule the study therapy sessions involving&#xD;
      the protocol. Based on the randomization scheme provided by the lead site, consented subjects&#xD;
      will be randomized to either the BWSS with perturbations (BWSS-P) or standard BWSS control&#xD;
      without perturbations. Subjects will perform 2 to 6 sessions in their designated intervention&#xD;
      using a structured protocol for each session. To compare differences between treatment&#xD;
      groups, outcome measures will be collected at baseline before any BWSS sessions are performed&#xD;
      and within 48 hours after completing the final treatment session.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each year, more than 795,000 people experience a stroke. Stroke, or cerebral vascular&#xD;
      accident, is a devastating neurological event that can lead to physical and cognitive&#xD;
      deficits, such as the inability to ambulate, impaired balance regulation, loss of&#xD;
      coordination, and impaired communication. Due to the physical and cognitive deficits&#xD;
      experienced following a stroke, many require admission to an inpatient rehabilitation&#xD;
      facility with the goal of maximizing their independence before returning to the home setting.&#xD;
      Gait and balance dysfunction are common secondary impairments to stroke, usually requiring&#xD;
      specific rehabilitative interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following a stroke, motion analysis has observed patients navigating obstacles more&#xD;
      conservatively and with abnormal gait patterns. One associated factor is the loss of&#xD;
      muscle-strength secondary to stroke, which could increase the risk of falling. Within&#xD;
      six-months of discharge, falls occur in up to 70% of patients post-stroke, highlighting the&#xD;
      importance and urgency to improve patients' balance and gait during the rehabilitation phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As patients may better understand their capabilities/limitation than what the physical tests&#xD;
      demonstrate, patient self-assessments can be important indicators of fall risk. In fact, it&#xD;
      is estimated that over 90% of stroke survivors would report that the fear of falling&#xD;
      negatively impacts their performance of daily living activities. Fear of falling has been&#xD;
      shown to influence balance and gait control in older adults, supporting the theory that&#xD;
      balance and gait should be taken into account during rehabilitative methods. These&#xD;
      psychological factors are strong predictors of falling compared to physical factors or the&#xD;
      presence of pathology. Patient self-assessments are important indicators of fall risk, as&#xD;
      patients may understand their capabilities/limitation better than what physical tests can&#xD;
      demonstrate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ability to walk, stand, and climb stairs are examples of mobility-related functional&#xD;
      tasks that are critical for achieving functional independence. With those with stroke related&#xD;
      balance and gait impairments, early and frequent balance and gait training are essential to&#xD;
      maximizing functional ability and independence. However, it is often difficult for&#xD;
      post-stroke patients with these impairments to safely undergo the necessary balance and gait&#xD;
      training without putting both therapists and patients at risk for injury. It is also&#xD;
      reasonable to suspect that any injurious falls that occur during rehabilitation would&#xD;
      reinforce, or create, a psychological fear of falling that would impede the recovery of the&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, injurious falls can prolong a patient's length of stay, increasing the economic&#xD;
      and financial strain both to the individual and their family as the patient is out work. Any&#xD;
      falls, but especially injurious falls, can also increase the financial burden of an&#xD;
      institution. In some cases, patients need to be carefully examined and imaged to confirm the&#xD;
      presence or absence of injury. If the necessary imaging equipment isn't available, a patient&#xD;
      may need to be taken to an outside location or even emergently transferred. Improving a&#xD;
      patient's gait and balance earlier in their stay may also prevent other injurious falls&#xD;
      outside of therapy as well. It could also improve a patient's fall risk, meaning that&#xD;
      resources, such as safety sitters, can be minimized, further improving the financial burden&#xD;
      of the institution. These benefits can be achieved, in part, by focusing on and improving a&#xD;
      patient's balance and gait status. Incorporating robotic technologies to neurological&#xD;
      rehabilitation can play a critical role in delivering safe and effective gait and balance&#xD;
      therapy sooner in a patient's stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body-weight support systems (BWSS) are either stationary or track-mounted suspended-harnesses&#xD;
      that support a patient's body-weight. This permits those with significant weakness and poor&#xD;
      coordination to ambulate and perform more intensive therapy sessions sooner in their&#xD;
      recovery, with minimal risk of injurious fall. In addition to BWSSs, balance perturbation&#xD;
      systems have been used to improve gait and balance-control after stroke, or other age and&#xD;
      disease related balance impairments. Balance perturbation systems purposefully unbalance&#xD;
      patients in order to rehabilitate their postural control. Conventional balance perturbation&#xD;
      training, including modified treadmills, tilt-tables, or external force provided by the&#xD;
      therapist directly, can pose an injury risk to the therapist and the patient. While&#xD;
      incorporation of stationary BWSSs over modified treadmills can decrease the injury risk,&#xD;
      ambulation over treadmills is not typically representative of a patients' functional&#xD;
      ambulation in their home environment. Systems such as these may also limit the participation&#xD;
      of patients who would otherwise benefit from balance perturbation training, but are&#xD;
      uncomfortable or unable to ambulate on a treadmill. Direct integration of the balance&#xD;
      perturbation modules to the BWSS can resolve many of these issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this multisite study is to build upon a recent pilot study and further evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy of this newly developed BWSS integrated balance perturbation system in&#xD;
      rehabilitating patient gait and balance after stroke, compared to standard BWSS training&#xD;
      without perturbations. In the pilot study, 32 participants were recruited, half of whom were&#xD;
      unbalanced during stationary and ambulatory activities to train their balance-control and&#xD;
      balance-reactions. Both the BWSS and BWSS with perturbation groups demonstrated significant&#xD;
      improvements in balance-related confidence and balance performance outcome measures (Berg&#xD;
      Balance Scale) in comparison to both their baseline and a historic control. However, when&#xD;
      compared to the BWSS control, the outcomes of the BWSS-P group only trended in the predicted&#xD;
      positive direction, and were not significantly different. The investigators believe this was,&#xD;
      in part, due to the small sample size and variation in timing of the post-assessment Berg&#xD;
      Balance scales. It is hypothesized that by increasing the sample size to achieve the&#xD;
      appropriate power for the effect size observed in the pilot study, the BWSS with balance&#xD;
      perturbation intervention will improve patient outcomes more than the BWSS treatment alone.&#xD;
      Further, with the data collected from the larger sample size, it is proposed to conduct&#xD;
      correlative analysis to determine what, if any, variables influence participant response to&#xD;
      treatment. To address these hypotheses, these are the proposed research aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Aim 1: Conduct an unblinded multisite randomized-control trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness and appropriate dose requirements of a track-mounted BWSS perturbation module&#xD;
      to improve balance and gait impairments in patients receiving inpatient rehabilitation&#xD;
      services for stroke with a BBS score ≥21/56 (n=214). Hypothesis: Post-intervention balance&#xD;
      and gait assessments will show that BWSS-P participants improved more than participants&#xD;
      receiving BWSS alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Aim 2: Conduct post hoc correlative analyses to identify what affect participant&#xD;
      variability, such as differences in stroke lesion laterality/location, age, sex, number of&#xD;
      BWSS sessions, and time since stroke, may have on participant response to treatment.&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Participant specific variables will impact the efficacy and participant response&#xD;
      to treatment.&#xD;
