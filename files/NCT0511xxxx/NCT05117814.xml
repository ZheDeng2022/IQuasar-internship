      Zanubrutinib is a novel BTK inhibitor with proven activity in patients with various B-cell&#xD;
      lymphomas addicted to the B-cell receptor signaling pathway.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies involving gene expression profiling and next generation sequencing have demonstrated&#xD;
      that CNS lymphomas mostly are of the ABC-subtype and harbor mutations that reinforce BCR&#xD;
      signaling. Ibrutinib, as the first BTK inhibitor, showed substantial activity in patients&#xD;
      with R/R PCNSL and R/R SCNSL. Zanubrutinib is a novel BTK inhibitor with proven activity in&#xD;
      patients with various B-cell lymphomas addicted to the B-cell receptor signaling pathway. In&#xD;
      addition, pharmacological studies demonstrated the free drug exposure of zanubrutinib at 160&#xD;
      mg BID is roughly 10 times that of ibrutinib at 560 mg QD, and penetration into the CNS by&#xD;
      zanubrutinib and ibrutinib is similar, suggesting the potential activity of zanubrutinib in&#xD;
      the treatment of CNS lymphomas. However, the outcome of R/R PCNSL and R/R SCNSL patients&#xD;
      treated with zanubrutinib monotherapy is still unclear.&#xD;
