  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inadequate management of preoperative mental health disorders often contributes to poor&#xD;
      postoperative outcomes, including increased rates of readmission, delirium, falls, and&#xD;
      mortality. However, very little work has been done to improve perioperative mental health. In&#xD;
      particular, there has been limited systematic efforts that identify evidence-based behavioral&#xD;
      and pharmacological strategies that were originally developed for depression and anxiety in&#xD;
      otherwise medically well psychiatric patients. A mental health intervention bundle, composed&#xD;
      of behavioral and pharmacological strategies, can mitigate anxiety and depression symptoms&#xD;
      during the perioperative period. However, lacking is conclusive evidence on effectiveness of&#xD;
      such an intervention bundle focused on the delivery of perioperative mental health care in&#xD;
      older surgical patients. Towards this end, the investigators will develop and test an&#xD;
      intervention bundle that encompasses: (1) behavioral activation, and (2) medication&#xD;
      optimization.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research is relevant to public health because the prevalence of undertreated&#xD;
      depression/anxiety in older adults coupled with the increasing number of surgeries performed&#xD;
      in this population are creating a crucial need for the integration of mental health&#xD;
      interventions into critical periods, such as the perioperative period. Thus, the proposed&#xD;
      research is relevant to the mission of the NIMH to transform the treatment of mental&#xD;
      illnesses through clinical research, paving the way for prevention, recovery, and cure.&#xD;

    <description>Behavioral activation (BA) will span across 3 months postoperatively &amp; will begin pre-operatively, with sessions approximately weekly or biweekly, depending on patient preference &amp; health condition.&#xD;
Medications will be reviewed &amp; optimized by a team of interventionists including a psychiatrist, pharmacologist, &amp; pharmacists. While the participant is in-hospital, the interventionist's role will include coordinating with the hospital team to ensure that medication changes that were introduced preoperatively are maintained in-house &amp; that no new inappropriate medications are initiated. After discharge, &amp; up to approximately 3 months postoperatively, the interventionist will ensure that medication changes are reconciled during transitions of care. The interventionists will ensure the agreed-upon changes are implemented, or an alternative course of action is justified.</description>
