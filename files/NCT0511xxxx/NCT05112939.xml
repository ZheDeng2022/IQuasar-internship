        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant must be healthy on the basis of physical examination, medical history,&#xD;
             vital signs, and 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) performed at screening (results must&#xD;
             be available on Day -1)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant must be healthy on the basis of clinical laboratory tests performed at&#xD;
             screening (results must be available prior to dosing on Day 1). If there are&#xD;
             abnormalities, the participant may be included only if the investigator judges the&#xD;
             abnormalities or deviations from normal to be not clinically significant. This&#xD;
             determination must be recorded in the participant's source documents and initialed by&#xD;
             the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All women participants must have a negative highly sensitive serum (Beta-human&#xD;
             chorionic gonadotropin [Beta-hCG]) pregnancy test at screening and on Day -1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A woman must agree not to donate eggs (ova, oocytes) or freeze for future use for the&#xD;
             purposes of assisted reproduction during the study and for at least 72 weeks after&#xD;
             receiving the last dose of study intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A male participant (not vasectomized) who is heterosexually active with a woman of&#xD;
             childbearing potential must agree to use two effective contraceptive methods for the&#xD;
             duration of the study (72 weeks follow-up), or for at least 72 weeks after receiving&#xD;
             the last dose of study intervention for those who do not complete the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant with a history of or current illness that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, might confound the results of the study or pose an additional risk in&#xD;
             administering study intervention to the participant or that could prevent, limit or&#xD;
             confound the protocol specified assessments. This may include, but is not limited to,&#xD;
             hepatic or renal dysfunction, cardiac disease, vascular, significant pulmonary&#xD;
             disease, including bronchospastic respiratory disease, diabetes mellitus, neurologic,&#xD;
             hematologic, coagulation disorders (including any abnormal bleeding or blood&#xD;
             dyscrasias), or psychiatric disturbances&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has a history of malignancy within 5 years before screening (exceptions&#xD;
             are squamous and basal cell carcinomas of the skin and carcinoma in situ of the&#xD;
             cervix, or malignancy, which is considered cured with minimal risk of recurrence)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to any components of&#xD;
             the formulation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with the following ECG findings, if clinically significant: abnormal PR,&#xD;
             QRS, and QTc intervals; rhythm abnormalities; evidence of acute ischemic changes&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a history of clinically relevant skin disease such as, but not&#xD;
             limited to, dermatitis, eczema, drug rash, drug allergy, psoriasis, food allergy,&#xD;
             urticaria&#xD;
