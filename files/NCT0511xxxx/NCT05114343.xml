  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will aim to test the effectiveness and feasibility of a technology-supported&#xD;
      home-based exercise program in adolescents with JIA. For this, adolescents (&lt; 18 years) with&#xD;
      JIA will be randomized to a 12-weeks home-based exercise program or usual care (i.e., no&#xD;
      exercise control intervention). The home-based exercise intervention will be delivered&#xD;
      remotely using a video calling app, and participants will be instructed to perform 3 sessions&#xD;
      of weight-bearing exercise per week. Participants will be supported by educational materials,&#xD;
      a heart rate monitor, and through periodic contact with an exercise specialist via video and&#xD;
      phone calls, and text messages. The study's primary outcomes will be: cardiac and vascular&#xD;
      function and structure using ultrasound imaging, body composition (DXA), aerobic capacity,&#xD;
      muscle strength and functional capacity. In addition to that, the feasibility, safety,&#xD;
      acceptability, and barriers and facilitators to the intervention will also be assessed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common type of arthritis in children and&#xD;
      adolescents under the age of 16. In addition to the articular features of the disease, JIA is&#xD;
      also characterized by multiple comorbidities, including cardiovascular manifestations. Part&#xD;
      of the health conditions observed in adolescents with JIA may be caused by a reduced practice&#xD;
      of physical activity. Lack of physical activity in this disease has been attributed to&#xD;
      generic and specific barriers, such as time constraints, low motivation, limited access to&#xD;
      specialized exercise centers, lack of specific programs for JIA patients, among others. More&#xD;
      recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has imposed additional challenges for the engagement in&#xD;
      physical activity in populations with chronic disease, including patients with JIA. In this&#xD;
      scenario, home-based exercise programs supported by technology have arisen as potentially&#xD;
      effective alternatives to upregulate physical activity levels in adolescents with JIA, which&#xD;
      needs to be further explored. Therefore, the aim of this study will be to test the&#xD;
      effectiveness and feasibility of a technology-supported home-based exercise program in&#xD;
      adolescents with JIA. For this, adolescent (&lt; 18 years) patients with JIA will be randomized&#xD;
      to a 12-weeks home-based exercise program or usual care (i.e., no exercise control&#xD;
      intervention). The home-based exercise intervention will be delivered remotely using a video&#xD;
      calling app, and participants will be instructed to perform 3 sessions of weight-bearing&#xD;
      exercise per week. Exercise intensity and duration will be low-to-moderate in the first 4&#xD;
      weeks, and will progressively increase during the program. Participants will be supported by&#xD;
      educational materials, a heart rate monitor, and by means of periodic contact with an&#xD;
      exercise specialist via video and phone calls, and text messages. Participants in the control&#xD;
      group will receive usual care and general instructions about physical activity. The study's&#xD;
      primary outcome will be the cardiac and vascular structure and function assessed by vascular&#xD;
      ultrasound imaging, body composition (DXA), aerobic capacity, muscle strength and functional&#xD;
      capacity. Secondary outcomes will include clinical aspects of the disease, blood parameters,&#xD;
      physical activity and sedentary behavior, food consumption, health-related quality of life,&#xD;
      blood pressure, and cardiac autonomic function. Feasibility, safety, acceptability, and&#xD;
      barriers and facilitators to the intervention will also be evaluated. The effects of the&#xD;
      intervention on study outcomes will be assessed by a mixed model analysis (p &lt; 0.05).&#xD;
