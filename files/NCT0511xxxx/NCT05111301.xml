      A prospective, multicenter study of 6 weeks of home use of Control-IQ technology in&#xD;
      individuals with type 2 diabetes age 18 and older.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this prospective, multicenter study is to assess safety and explore glycemic&#xD;
      outcomes associated with use of Control-IQ technology in adults with type 2 diabetes who&#xD;
      require insulin. After an initial run-in period, all participants will use the study system&#xD;
      (pump and CGM) for 6 weeks. Participants will perform exercise challenges once each week&#xD;
      during the study.&#xD;
