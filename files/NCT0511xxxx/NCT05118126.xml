      Prospective, observational study to explore the significance of gut microbiome in the&#xD;
      diagnosis of ITP, and to identify the predictive value of baseline gut microbiome for GC&#xD;
      resistance/relapse.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A prospective, observational study to (1) collect fecal samples from ITP patients at initial&#xD;
      diagnosis (baseline) and after first-line GC treatment, (2) detect the composition of gut&#xD;
      microbiome and related metabolites using metagenomic sequencing combined with metabolomics,&#xD;
      (3) observe the impact of first-line treatment on gut microbiome, (4) explore the&#xD;
      significance of gut microbiome in the diagnosis of ITP, and (5) identify the predictive value&#xD;
      of baseline gut microbiome for GC resistance/relapse, thus to provide new ideas for clinical&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment of ITP.&#xD;

      Fecal sample collection and metagenomic sequencing: A specific stool sample collector was&#xD;
      selected to collect an appropriate amount of stool samples (≥1g/ sample). Samples that could&#xD;
      not be extracted immediately were transported on dry ice and stored at -80℃. DNA was&#xD;
      extracted by phenol/chloroform method. Qubit Fluorometer is used to test samples DNA&#xD;
      concentration, agarose gel electrophoresis (gel concentration: 1%; Voltage: 150 V;&#xD;
      Electrophoresis time: 40 min) is used to test DNA integrity of samples, and unqualified&#xD;
      samples with insufficient DNA amount or degradation were eliminated. Qualified samples were&#xD;
      used for DNA library construction and Illumina sequencing. The sequencing library was&#xD;
      constructed according to Illumina's official operating instructions and further optimized.&#xD;
      Qualified libraries were sequenced using Illumina platform.&#xD;
