  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is testing the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK, the amount of study&#xD;
      drug in your blood) and pharmacodynamics (PD, how the study drug affects your body) of single&#xD;
      doses of a new drug called KUR-101.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 58 healthy men or women aged between 18-55 will be enrolled in this study in two parts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 will involve a single ascending (increasing) dose (SAD) where 40 participants (5&#xD;
      groups of 8) will be randomised (assigned randomly, like flipping a coin) to receive a single&#xD;
      oral dose of the study drug or placebo. The placebo will look the same as the study drug but&#xD;
      will not contain any medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: will involve a crossover design where 18 participants will be randomised to receive a&#xD;
      single oral dose of each of three interventions (study drug, placebo or a marketed form of&#xD;
      oxycodone). Each dose is separated by 7 days and the participants are randomised so they do&#xD;
      not know the order of the interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Part 1 the total participation will last 9 days, of which 4 days (3 nights) will be spent&#xD;
      in the clinic. One group of subjects in Part 1 will return to the clinic to receive a second&#xD;
      dose of drug given with a high fat breakfast. In this group, the total participation will&#xD;
      last 16 days, of which 8 days (7 nights) will be spent in the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Part 2 the total participation will last 23 days, of which 9 days (8 nights) will be&#xD;
      spent in the clinic.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, single-center, prospective, study of orally administered KUR-101 in normal&#xD;
      healthy participants. The study will be conducted in two parts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, PK, analgesic and respiratory effects of single ascending doses of orally&#xD;
      administered KUR-101 in normal healthy participants. Once the MTD has been determined, this&#xD;
      dose, or an alternate lower dose, will be taken into Part 2 of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-period crossover study to&#xD;
      assess the analgesic and respiratory effects of a single oral KUR-101 as compared to that of&#xD;
      oxycodone in normal healthy participants.&#xD;
