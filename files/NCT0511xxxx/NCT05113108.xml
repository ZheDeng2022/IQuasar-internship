      Preterm birth is associated with various brain injuries. The earlier the period of gestation,&#xD;
      more is the incidence of brain injuries. Brain injuries are known to be one of the most&#xD;
      important factors leading to significant morbidity and mortality in these vulnerable preterm&#xD;
      babies.{1} Cranial ultrasound (CUS) examinations have been performed on preterm infants to&#xD;
      diagnose various perinatal brain injuries and for the prediction of long term outcomes.{2}&#xD;
      Cranial ultrasonography (CUS) is the preferred modality to image the neonatal brain.{3} The&#xD;
      advantages of CUS are numerous: it can be performed at the bedside with little disturbance to&#xD;
      the infant, it is relatively safe, and can be repeated whenever needed, enabling&#xD;
      visualization of ongoing brain maturation and the evolution of lesions.{4,5}&#xD;

    <description>All neonates undergoing CUS at nursery unit at assiut university hospital. Cranial ultrasound is performed with basic grayscale imaging. For optimal resolution and good overview, a multifrequency (5-10 MHz) linear or convex sector transducer is used. Imaging is obtained through the anterior fontanel in the coronal and sagittal planes.{12,13} Typically, six to eight coronal images are obtained beginning at the frontal lobes just anterior to the frontal horns and extending to the occipital lobes posterior to the lateral ventricle trigones.{14} The transducer is then rotated 90Â°, and approximately five images are obtained, including a midline sagittal view of the corpus callosum and cerebellar vermis in addition to bilateral parasagittal images beginning in the midline and progressing laterally through the peripheral cortex.Doppler ultrasound may be added to assess ischemic areas.{13-15}</description>
