  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a sub-study for data analysis of data collected as part of the larger randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial &quot;Effectiveness and Implementation of mPATH-CRC&quot; (NCT03843957) to determine&#xD;
      if self-administered screening with an iPad increases the detection of patients with&#xD;
      depression, falls, and intimate partner violence.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As part of the parent study (NCT0343957), investigators developed an iPad program called&#xD;
      mPATH that patients use at their primary care clinician's office to encourage colorectal&#xD;
      cancer screening. To encourage practices to use mPATH with every patient, the investigators&#xD;
      included in the program the health system's required screening items for depression, fall&#xD;
      risk, and intimate partner violence, thereby offloading this routine task from clinical&#xD;
      staff. It is possible that mPATH will increase detection of depression, fall risk, and&#xD;
      intimate partner violence because: 1) mPATH systematically asks these screening items of all&#xD;
      patients, and 2) patients may feel more comfortable answering these items on an iPad survey&#xD;
      than during an in-person interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the effect of mPATH on the performance of this screening, investigators will&#xD;
      examine a limited use dataset comparing the 2 months before a clinic started using mPATH to&#xD;
      the 2 months after the clinic began using mPATH. Because clinics may need some time to fully&#xD;
      adopt mPATH, investigators will exclude the first two weeks following the launch of mPATH.&#xD;

    <measure>Proportion of Participants Screening Positive for Depression, Fall Risk or Intimate Partner Violence - Pre mPATH Use</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months prior to use of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome will be the proportion of patients seen in each time period (&quot;pre&quot; vs. &quot;post&quot;) who screen positive for depression, fall risk, or intimate partner violence. The &quot;pre&quot; time period will be Days -60 to -1 (the 60 day period before mPATH Launch). Screening positive for depression will be a score of 3 or greater on the Patient Health Questionnaire-2. Screening positive for fall risk will be answering &quot;yes&quot; to having a device to assist with mobility and/or having fallen in the last year. Screening positive for intimate partner violence will be answering yes to any of the health system's three questions about safety in the home.</description>

    <measure>Proportion of Participants Screening Positive for Depression, Fall Risk or Intimate Partner Violence - Post mPATH Use</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months after use of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome will be the proportion of patients seen in each time period (&quot;pre&quot; vs. &quot;post&quot;) who screen positive for depression, fall risk, or intimate partner violence. The &quot;post&quot; time period will be days 14 to 73 (the 60 day period commencing 2 weeks after mPATH Launch). Screening positive for depression will be a score of 3 or greater on the Patient Health Questionnaire-2. Screening positive for fall risk will be answering &quot;yes&quot; to having a device to assist with mobility and/or having fallen in the last year. Screening positive for intimate partner violence will be answering yes to any of the health system's three questions about safety in the home.</description>

    <measure>Proportion of Participants Screening Positive for Depression Using Patient Health Questionnaires (PHQ-2 score of 3 or greater)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months before and 2 months after using intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-2 inquires about the frequency of depressed mood and anhedonia over the past two weeks. Screen positive for depression using the PHQ-2 items. PHQ-2 score obtained by adding score for each question (total points). A PHQ-2 score ranges from 0-6. If the score is 3 or greater, major depressive disorder is likely.</description>

    <description>The PHQ-9 is a multipurpose instrument for screening, diagnosing, monitoring and measuring the severity of depression. PHQ-9 score obtained by adding score for each question (total points). Total scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represent cut points for mild, moderate, moderately severe and severe depression, respectively.</description>
