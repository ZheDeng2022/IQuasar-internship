  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension is a public health concern and affects nearly a third of the French population.&#xD;
      It can be complicated by visceral impact (including brain, heart and kidney complications) as&#xD;
      well as on vessels especially large arteries, responsible for arterial stiffening. There are&#xD;
      close interactions between heart and kidneys, as well as between large arteries and&#xD;
      micro-vessels. These relationships also involve the water and salt balance and its regulatory&#xD;
      mechanisms. Urinary concentration abilities are closely linked to the renal medullary blood&#xD;
      flow, which in itself depends on the integrity of renal micro vessels, thus influencing the&#xD;
      water and salt balance. Few previous studies evaluated the interconnections between renal&#xD;
      urinary concentration abilities and blood pressure. A previous-one reported a positive&#xD;
      relation between pulse pressure and urinary concentration in men, suggesting that subjects&#xD;
      with higher urinary osmolarity could present a higher cardiovascular risk. Carotid-femoral&#xD;
      pulse wave velocity represents the gold standard for non-invasive arterial stiffness&#xD;
      assessment and constitutes an arteriosclerosis infra-clinical marker recommended by the&#xD;
      European Society of Cardiology- European Society of Hypertension. It is considered as an&#xD;
      independent predictor for global and cardiovascular mortality, coronary heart disease and&#xD;
      fatal stroke among patients with hypertension, diabetes or end stage kidney disease. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to evaluate the relations between fasting urinary osmolarity and&#xD;
      arterial stiffness assessed by carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (CF-PWV) among patients&#xD;
      with hypertension.&#xD;

      1. Hypertension&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Hypertension, kidneys et urinary sodium excretion&#xD;
&#xD;
                Kidneys are heavily involved in blood pressure regulation in particular through&#xD;
                water and salt balance control, and their impact on vasomotor tone through the&#xD;
                renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS), prostaglandins or atrial natriuretic&#xD;
                factor (FAN) actions. They take a central place in blood pressure regulation and&#xD;
                indirectly in arterial stiffening.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Daily urinary sodium excretion represents a major determinant of blood pressure. It&#xD;
                is defined as the product of urinary sodium concentration and urinary output. In a&#xD;
                steady state, it equals sodium intake. When kidneys are unable to excrete sodium,&#xD;
                blood volume and blood pressure increase. The result is an adaptive decrease in&#xD;
                sodium reabsorption (called &quot;pressure natriuresis&quot;), in order to restore the sodium&#xD;
                balance. &quot;Salt sensitivity&quot; has been defined as a significant increase in blood&#xD;
                pressure associated with the increase sodium intake. It has been associated with&#xD;
                age, ethnicity, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and chronic kidney disease (CKD).&#xD;
                Chronic kidney disease is frequently associated with salt and fluid retention,&#xD;
                which promote hypertension and increase cardiovascular risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Among dialysis patients, fluid overload has been widely described as an independent&#xD;
                mortality risk factor. Recently, Faucon et al. reported in the nephroTEST cohort of&#xD;
                CKD patients not yet on dialysis that the measured extra cellular volume (ECV) was&#xD;
                an independent risk factor for mortality but also for CKD progression to the end&#xD;
                stage of kidney disease. Reduced sodium excretion abilities associated with CKD&#xD;
                progression lead to fluid overload and cardiac consequences. The increase of left&#xD;
                ventricular preload promotes diastolic dysfunction. In parallel, the prolonged&#xD;
                increase of left ventricular afterload promotes left ventricular hypertrophy. Other&#xD;
                CKD associated factors could also contribute to left ventricular hypertrophy such&#xD;
                as the increased arterial stiffness, and CKD-mineral and bone disorders including&#xD;
                the raise of FGF-23.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Nephron, water and salt balance regulation, and outside of the glomerulus&#xD;
&#xD;
                The nephron represents the kidney functional unit. It plays a major role in water&#xD;
                and salt balance control. &quot;Kidney function&quot; assessment is often reduced to its&#xD;
                glomerular functions, including glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and albuminuria&#xD;
                level. The other segments of the nephron are however largely involved in this&#xD;
                balance control. Their function can be altered even without glomerular dysfunction&#xD;
                and therefore without renal insufficiency. Thus, tubular segments, peritubular&#xD;
                capillaries and the interstitial space can also be altered in some kidney diseases.&#xD;
                These structures, and more particularly the ascending limb of the loop of Henle,&#xD;
                the peritubular micro-vessels and the collecting duct, are involved in the&#xD;
                corticopapillary gradient creation and maintenance. This gradient is essential for&#xD;
                the urine concentrating mechanism. Tubular damages assessed on renal pathology&#xD;
                would also be more correlated to impaired urine concentration and acidification&#xD;
                than to glomeruli involvement. Fasting urinary osmolarity is a simple, non-invasive&#xD;
                marker for assessing urinary concentration abilities. It is yet poorly studied in&#xD;
                clinical research. At same level of GFR, its level would be associated with tubular&#xD;
                dysfunctions and peritubular vascular lesions, namely with medullary functions.&#xD;
                Fasting urinary osmolarity has also been associated with GFR decline and&#xD;
                progression of CKD to end stage kidney disease. On the other hand, some of the&#xD;
                tubular segments constitute direct targets of systemic hormonal regulation.&#xD;
                Aldosterone thus promotes sodium retention and potassium excretion through the&#xD;
                activation of mineralocorticoid receptors located on distal tubular cells and the&#xD;
                involvement of ENaC and ROMK channels.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Hypertension and urinary concentration&#xD;
&#xD;
           Perrucca et al. suggested that urinary concentration and its regulatory hormone,&#xD;
           antidiuretic hormone (ADH), may contribute to cardiovascular disease susceptibility. ADH&#xD;
           binding to its V2R receptor promotes distal reabsorption of free water and thus favors&#xD;
           urinary concentration. This hormone has thus an action through kidneys promoting urinary&#xD;
           concentration through free water reabsorption, but also a vascular effect leading to&#xD;
           vasoconstriction. Hypertension has been associated with increased plasma ADH levels.&#xD;
           Zhang et al. thus reported in a cohort of 534 middle-aged subjects, the significant&#xD;
           association between plasma ADH levels and blood pressure levels as well as with&#xD;
           hypertension, especially in patients with low plasma renin activity. The antidiuretic&#xD;
           hormone would also be at higher levels in men than in women, as well as in African&#xD;
           American subjects compared to Caucasians, likewise hypertension is also more frequent in&#xD;
           these two populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Furthermore, Bankir et al. described in a retrospective cohort of 141 healthy subjects&#xD;
           of 18 to 40 years old that black individuals presented significantly higher urine&#xD;
           concentration and lower urinary volume than white individuals. In addition, a&#xD;
           significant and positive relationship between urinary concentration levels and pulse&#xD;
           pressure was found among men. This association was more marked among black individuals&#xD;
           compared to white individuals. Since pulse pressure is currently considered as an&#xD;
           independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, associated with both cardiovascular&#xD;
           morbidity (increased incidence of myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure) and&#xD;
           cardiovascular mortality from coronary artery disease, an association between urinary&#xD;
           concentration abilities and cardiovascular risk could be considered. In addition, urine&#xD;
           dilution by increasing water intake is one of the main objective in the management of&#xD;
           lithiasis patients. The increase of urinary concentration is indeed associated with an&#xD;
           increased risk of crystallization and therefore an increased risk of kidney stones&#xD;
           recurrence. Lithiasis patients have also been described as a population with an&#xD;
           increased cardiovascular risk. These additional elements support the hypothesis of a&#xD;
           potential association between urinary concentration and cardiovascular risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Arterial stiffness&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Hypertension, arteriosclerosis and evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
                Arteriosclerosis represents an arterial degeneration process associated with&#xD;
                physiological aging but much more marked in some pathological circumstances such as&#xD;
                hypertension, diabetes or chronic kidney disease. The arterial wall involvement&#xD;
                concerns the media of large arteries, unlike atherosclerosis in which the&#xD;
                involvement initially involves the intima, resulting in an accelerated stiffening&#xD;
                of the vascular tree. Large arteries stiffening can induce myocardial hypertrophy,&#xD;
                favors heart failure, arrhythmias and even myocardial ischemia. Carotid-femoral&#xD;
                pulse wave velocity enables non-invasive assessment of central arterial stiffness.&#xD;
                It currently represents the gold standard for non-invasive arterial stiffness&#xD;
                measurements and constitutes an arteriosclerosis infra-clinical marker recommended&#xD;
                by the European Society of Cardiology- European Society of Hypertension. In&#xD;
                practice, it corresponds to the velocity at which the pulse wave propagates over a&#xD;
                specific arterial segment. The pulse wave travels slowly through flexible and&#xD;
                elastic arteries, and rapidly through rigid arteries. CF-PWV measurement requires&#xD;
                an automated software. It is a simple, non-invasive, validated, robust,&#xD;
                reproducible and accessible procedure in clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Arterial stiffness and cardiovascular risk&#xD;
&#xD;
                CF-PWV thus enables us to detect large arteries damages at an infra-clinical stage&#xD;
                and to identify populations at high cardiovascular risk. It has been described as&#xD;
                an independent predictor for global and cardiovascular mortality, coronary heart&#xD;
                disease and fatal stroke in many populations: in the general population, in elderly&#xD;
                patients, in patients with diabetes, with hypertension, in CKD-patients, patients&#xD;
                with end-stage kidney disease, and also in renal transplant recipients. Aortic&#xD;
                stiffness has been shown to be predictive of cardiovascular events, independently&#xD;
                and beyond traditional risk factors and the Framingham score.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Arterial stiffness and fluid overload&#xD;
&#xD;
                Fluid overload can also contribute to structural and functional alterations in&#xD;
                large arteries and therefore promote arterial stiffness. The increase in venous&#xD;
                pressure induced by sodium overload initiates a vicious circle. The result is an&#xD;
                increase in renal interstitial pressure, which disrupts renal blood flow, and&#xD;
                promotes further retention. Plasma volume expands, increasing venous pressure&#xD;
                further. The associated increase in filling pressures could thus promote structural&#xD;
                and functional alteration of large arteries.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Furthermore, the diastolic blood pressure decrease induce a reduction in coronary&#xD;
                perfusion pressure, which contributes to myocardial ischemia. In case of heart&#xD;
                failure, sodium retention is associated with a defective arterial filling. Urinary&#xD;
                sodium excretion decreases while sodium and fluid overload increases.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Micro- and macro-vessels relationships&#xD;
&#xD;
           Safar et al. previously reported the links between macro- and micro-vessels evidenced by&#xD;
           mouse models of hypertension and human studies. Indeed, pulse pressure increase&#xD;
           associated with arterial compliance disturbances promotes impaired microcirculation,&#xD;
           particularly in kidneys. An alteration of the extracellular matrix could involve both&#xD;
           vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and renal cells. Several underlying&#xD;
           physiopathological mechanisms have been suggested, involving notably the water and salt&#xD;
           balance and the hormonal systemic regulatory mechanisms including the&#xD;
           renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Urinary concentration abilities are closely linked&#xD;
           to the renal medullary blood flow which itself depends on the renal microcirculation&#xD;
           integrity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Studied-population&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study focus on patients with severe/resistant hypertension and/or with suspicion of&#xD;
      secondary hypertension, who are addressed in a one-day hospitalization to benefit from&#xD;
      standardized examinations including hormonal analyses (renin - aldosterone ± plasma&#xD;
      cortisol). These hypertensive patients present an increased cardiovascular risk. The CF-PWV&#xD;
      measure enables aortic stiffness assessment. It constitutes an arteriosclerosis&#xD;
      infra-clinical marker recommended by the European Society of Cardiology- European Society of&#xD;
      Hypertension.&#xD;
