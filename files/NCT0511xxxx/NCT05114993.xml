  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An Interventional Study is planned with the primary purpose of screening for changes in&#xD;
      end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2), inspired carbon dioxide (ICO2), and other vital signs that&#xD;
      may develop after donning a disposable surgical mask.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements will be taken and recorded during a 5-minute control period without a mask,&#xD;
      recording non-invasive ETCO2 and ICO2 levels by way of a nasal cannula (NC), oxygen&#xD;
      saturation (SpO2), breaths per minute (RR), and heart rate (HR) via anesthesia equipment.&#xD;
      This will be followed by a 15-minute intervention of wearing a disposable surgical mask and&#xD;
      repeating measurements of ETCO2, ICO2, SpO2, RR, and HR, recorded each minute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected from adults and children as young as 2 years of age. Age groups will&#xD;
      include children aged 2-14 and adults aged 18 to 80, as described in the details of the&#xD;
      research protocol. Parents and their children are invited to participate together.&#xD;

After 5 minutes, all study subjects will don the same model of disposable surgical mask. The same measurements will be taken, including End Tidal CO2, Inspired CO2, Pulse Oximetry, Respiratory Rate, and Heart Rate each minute with a mask x 15 minutes.</description>
