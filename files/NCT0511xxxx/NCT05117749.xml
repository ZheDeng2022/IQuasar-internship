  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      IBD is a chronic disease with two major types of Crohn's Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis&#xD;
      (UC). Nowadays, synthetic drugs and monoclonal antibodies are the most common types of drugs&#xD;
      used for IBD management. However, due to their side effects and the high relapse rate, many&#xD;
      researchers are looking for plant-derived products to manage the disease. Saffron, Crocus&#xD;
      sativus L., is widely used as spice and medicine with anti-obesity, anticonvulsant,&#xD;
      anti-hyperlipidemic, anti-tumor, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties. Besides,&#xD;
      there is evidence of the favorable effects of saffron on the gut microbiome. The main aim of&#xD;
      this proposal is to evaluate the effect of saffron as a complementary supplement or add-on&#xD;
      therapy in combination with current therapeutic agents in patients with mild and moderate UC.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will be a parallel, randomized, double-blinded clinical trial assessing the&#xD;
      efficacy of the saffron extract compared to placebo in patients with mild and moderate UC.&#xD;
      Sixty eligible patients will be recruited and randomized into 6 groups to receive either&#xD;
      saffron capsule or placebo. Randomization will be performed by an independent researcher&#xD;
      (AAK) who is not directly involved in the trial and using software-generated random permuted&#xD;
      blocks. Allocation concealment will be also conducted using sealed, opaque envelopes with&#xD;
      consecutive numbering. The saffron and placebo will be provided free of charge by Sina&#xD;
      Pajoohan Salamat co, Mashhad, Iran. According to the catalog provided by the company, each&#xD;
      capsule contains 16.2 mg of standard saffron extract (0.7 percent crocin equivalent to 3.5 mg&#xD;
      of crocin per capsule). The standard treatment will be administered to all patients as&#xD;
      recommendations of the physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention groups of study will be included:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Mild UC patients, receiving100 milligram (mg)/day saffron for 8 weeks (50 mg two times&#xD;
           (BID)), n=10&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Moderate UC patients, receiving100 mg/day saffron for 8 weeks (50 mg BID), n=10&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Mild UC patients, receiving 50 mg/day saffron for 8 weeks (25 mg BID), n=10&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Moderate UC patients, receiving 50 mg/day saffron for 8 weeks (25 mg BID), n=10&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Mild UC patients, receiving 2 tablets of placebo for 8 weeks, n=10&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Moderate UC patients, receiving 2 tablets of placebo for 8 weeks, n=10&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic and baseline characteristics will be recorded, and assessment of anthropometric&#xD;
      and biochemical parameters, fecal calprotectin, inflammatory cytokines, stool microbiome, and&#xD;
      its transcriptomic, and metabolomic, urine and saliva metabolomics, health-related quality of&#xD;
      life (HRQoL), anxiety, and disease severity will be done at baseline and after 8 weeks. Fecal&#xD;
      calprotectin, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and disease&#xD;
      severity will also be evaluated at 4th week. Moreover, HRQoL and anxiety will also be&#xD;
      examined after 6 and 12 months.&#xD;
