      Allotransplantation of maxillofacial of subject with severe facial deformities due to&#xD;
      traumatic events.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A facial transplantation is a highly dynamic, prolonged operation requiring teams&#xD;
      communicating seamlessly through its duration. This is similar to complex solid organ&#xD;
      transplant teams at Methodist Transplant Institute. The Institute's clinical experience in&#xD;
      management of complex facial defects and deformities along with the personnel and&#xD;
      infrastructure at Methodist Dallas transplant institute would help develop a center for&#xD;
      Facial Allotransplantation. The team experience, true collaboration, creativity and a unique&#xD;
      approach to each patient would help provide the optimal care and reconstruction for the face&#xD;
      allotransplant patient both before and after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is centered on the advancement of a safe and effective procedure&#xD;
      for Facial Allotransplantation at Methodist Hospital Medical Center at Dallas. Composite&#xD;
      tissue allotransplantation for facial reconstruction is in its infancy as liver&#xD;
      transplantation was 30 years ago when the first liver transplant was completed in Texas. This&#xD;
      study will establish Methodist Hospital System as a center for Facial Allotransplantation for&#xD;
      reconstruction of extensive facial defects resulting in functional loss and poor quality of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient participation post transplantation will either be for life, or failure of the&#xD;
      composite tissue allograft. Patient enrollment will be initiated immediately after the IRB&#xD;
      approval. The enrollment period will be completed after the patient receives the final&#xD;
      transplant, and the study will be completed at 24 months after the final transplant. However,&#xD;
      all patients enrolled into the study will have lifelong follow up with immunosuppressive&#xD;
      management, psychological support, and evaluation of functional recovery per protocol.&#xD;
