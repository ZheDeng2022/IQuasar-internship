  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of this study is to compare traditional cataract surgery with two new&#xD;
      technologies: the femtosecond laser and the new Active Sentry handpiece.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The femtosecond laser is used in several fields of ophthalmology and allows to automate&#xD;
      multiple key steps of cataract surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The new generation of handpiece called Active Sentry has the particularity to detect the&#xD;
      pressure inside the eye in real time and to adjust it to avoid large variations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Theses technologies would potentially increase the efficacy and safety of standard cataract&#xD;
      surgery. This study therefore aims at evaluating the differences in cumulative dissipated&#xD;
      energy and endothelial cell loss between femtosecond laser assisted cataract surgery with the&#xD;
      new Active Sentry handpiece compared to standard phaco with new (Active Sentry) or older&#xD;
      handpieces (OZil).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phacoemulsification (phaco) has been the standard technique for cataract surgery for several&#xD;
      decades. It involves the removal of the lens nucleus after ultrasound fragmentation.&#xD;
      Recently, Femtosecond Laser Assisted Cataract Surgery (FLACS) has become a new popular method&#xD;
      amongst ophthalmologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The femtosecond laser (LFS) is a new technology that is being used for cataract surgery. The&#xD;
      LFS has a femtosecond pulse duration, which reduces damage to collateral tissue and increases&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of the procedure. The LenSx laser (Alcon Laboratories Inc., USA) is&#xD;
      one of the most widely used LFS for cataract surgery and is part of the CENTURION Vision&#xD;
      system. The LFS automates key steps in the procedure including capsulorhexis, incision making&#xD;
      and phaco, limiting human variability and potentially improving the efficiency and safety of&#xD;
      the surgery. The Frequency Domain - Optical Coherence Tomography (FD-OCT) optical imaging&#xD;
      system provides high-resolution, real-time visualization of ocular structures and their&#xD;
      dimensions. The device sends the results to the interface which programs the laser and&#xD;
      indicates the exact location, size and depth of the desired incisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several handpieces are used to perform phacoemulsification. The traditional handpiece is&#xD;
      named OZil and is part of the Infiniti Vision System (Alcon Laboratories Inc.) which was&#xD;
      introduced in 2006 and has since revolutionized the phaco technique with its new rotational&#xD;
      technology. This handpiece increased phaco efficacy by reducing core fragment repulsion,&#xD;
      collateral tissue damage, and the amount of energy required. However, a new generation of&#xD;
      handpiece called Active Sentry (Alcon Inc.), which is part of the new Active Fluidics&#xD;
      technology, has now the added feature of detecting the pressure inside the eye in real time&#xD;
      and adjusting it to avoid significant variations. This handpiece can also decrease the amount&#xD;
      of fluid and energy used during the procedure, increasing the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      phacoemulsification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different methods to quantify the collateral damage caused by cataract surgeries are the&#xD;
      count of endothelial cell loss (ECL) as well as the amount of energy required to fragment the&#xD;
      lens (CDE: cumulative dissipated energy). FLACS may reduce the CDE required during phaco,&#xD;
      thereby reducing the damage to the cornea of the eye (including the loss of endothelial cells&#xD;
      of the cornea).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite a large number of publications on this topic, recent meta-analyses on the effect of&#xD;
      FLACS on ECL and CDE were found to be inconsistent. Few studies have demonstrated a decrease&#xD;
      in ECL as well as CDE required in patients undergoing FLACS when compared to standard phaco,&#xD;
      but long-term results were not conclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the novelty of the Active Sentry handpiece, little data on this new device exists in&#xD;
      the literature. Based on what was found in the literature, this study will be the first to&#xD;
      compare the following techniques: FLACS with Active Sentry, traditional phaco with Active&#xD;
      Sentry, and traditional phaco with OZil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the new FLACS technique will reduce the CDE required&#xD;
      during phacoemulsification, thereby reducing the damage caused the cornea (i.e. loss of&#xD;
      endothelial corneal cells).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the investigators hypothesize that patients undergoing standard&#xD;
      phacoemulsification with the Active Sentry handpiece will have less corneal endothelial cell&#xD;
      damage and require less CDE than participants undergoing standard phacoemulsification with&#xD;
      OZil.&#xD;
