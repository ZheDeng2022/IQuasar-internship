  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study concerns patients who survived intensive care, after a minimum stay of 7 days and&#xD;
      presenting cognitive disorders (with a score ≤ 26 on the MoCA test) during the post-intensive&#xD;
      care follow-up consultation one month after ICU discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this prospective open-label randomized study is to assess the impact of&#xD;
      cognitive stimulation on recovery from cognitive impairment after a critical illness.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who survive a critical illness and a stay in intensive care may present a&#xD;
      post-intensive care syndrome. This syndrome comprises in particular cognitive disorders, with&#xD;
      memory disorders and executive disorders. The systemic inflammatory reaction seems to play an&#xD;
      important role in the genesis of these disorders. Frequently reported risk factors are&#xD;
      numerous and include hypoxemia, hypotension, glycemic dysregulation, drug toxicities, and,&#xD;
      delirium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In post-intensive care, these cognitive disorders are most often detected using screening&#xD;
      tests that quickly and superficially assess the major components of cognition. During the&#xD;
      standardized screening that we offer to patients who join the follow-up clinic of our&#xD;
      university hospital, we use the MoCA (Montreal Cognitive Assessment) as a screening test. In&#xD;
      a series of patients who survived a severe form of COVID-19, we observed that more than 80%&#xD;
      of patients did not achieve the maximum score on this test (MoCA &lt;30/30) 3 months after ICU&#xD;
      discharge, thus signifying the presence of cognitive impairment. Half of these patients had&#xD;
      mild disorders (MoCA&gt; 26/30), the other half had more pronounced disorders, based on commonly&#xD;
      accepted cut-off values (MoCA ≤ 26/30). Similar data are reported in other populations:&#xD;
      cognitive disorders are frequently encountered after ARDS of other etiologies [5, 6], and may&#xD;
      persist for several years after the acute episode [7].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Belgium, access to an exhaustive cognitive assessment and cognitive rehabilitation is&#xD;
      subject to different access criteria, which are not necessarily met by patients who have&#xD;
      survived intensive care. Such rehabilitation is then quite expensive for the patient.&#xD;
      Patients with cognitive impairment after intensive care may nevertheless benefit from aids in&#xD;
      cognitive recovery. In a few rare studies, it seems that non-specific cognitive training can&#xD;
      improve the cognitive outcome of patients who have survived intensive care [8].&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to several neuropsychologists interviewed as part of a preliminary investigation,&#xD;
      there are cognitive stimulation tools that could activate spontaneous cognitive recovery in&#xD;
      post-intensive care. Among them, the MEMO website (http://www.memory-motivation.org/home-2/)&#xD;
      offers free access to batteries of cognitive exercises. This website was created by a team of&#xD;
      psychologists, doctors, engineers and researchers in connection with the University of Nice&#xD;
      Sophia Antipolis. It was designed to meet the needs of patients with cognitive disorders,&#xD;
      healthcare professionals involved in prevention, rehabilitation and cognitive stimulation.&#xD;
      This computer hardware playfully stimulates memory, attention, executive functions, language&#xD;
      and gnosias. Several levels of difficulty are foreseen. In addition, the prescriber, by&#xD;
      creating a professional profile on the website, can monitor the compliance and performance of&#xD;
      patients to whom he has advised this platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This tool is intended as a means of stimulating cognitive recovery, but does not replace&#xD;
      neuropsychological management in the event of persistent cognitive disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our prospective randomized study is to assess the impact of cognitive stimulation&#xD;
      on the course of cognitive impairment within two months of discharge from intensive care.&#xD;
      Cognitive exercise cannot be offered too soon after the critical episode because patients are&#xD;
      extremely tired. On the contrary, these exercises cannot be postponed too long in order to&#xD;
      optimize the recovery as quickly as possible to the best possible functional state.&#xD;
