  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Being the most common arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation (AF) is a high burden of public health&#xD;
      with an increasing prevalence in our aging population. Interventional treatment of atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation by catheter ablation is one of the treatment pillars in the complex field of&#xD;
      &quot;better symptom control&quot; based on current Guidelines. Catheter ablation of atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation is based on electrical isolation of the pulmonary veins (pulmonary vein&#xD;
      isolation: PVI) from the left atrium. The main benefit and goal of PVI in AF patients is the&#xD;
      reduction of AF-related symptoms, resulting in an improvement of quality of life. It was&#xD;
      shown, that catheter ablation failed to prove a difference in AF recurrence after PVI&#xD;
      compared to medical therapy in the first 18 month of follow-up. It was also shown, that these&#xD;
      episodes will become more asymptomatic. This raises concerns that the symptomatic improvement&#xD;
      might be the result of a placebo effect, which will be elucidated with this study.&#xD;

      Being the most common arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation (AF) is a high burden of public health&#xD;
      with an increasing prevalence in our aging population. Interventional treatment of atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation by catheter ablation is one of the treatment pillars in the complex field of&#xD;
      &quot;better symptom control&quot; based on current Guidelines. Atrial fibrillation is commonly induced&#xD;
      and maintained by abnormal electrical impulses originating in the pulmonary veins. Catheter&#xD;
      ablation of atrial fibrillation is based on electrical isolation of the pulmonary veins&#xD;
      (pulmonary vein isolation: PVI) from the left atrium. This is achieved either by heating&#xD;
      (Radiofrequency ablation) or freezing (Cryoablation) of the tissues. By inducing the&#xD;
      formation of scar tissue, the pulmonary veins are &quot;electrically isolated&quot; and abnormal&#xD;
      electrical signals are not transferred any more to the left atrium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main benefit and goal of PVI in AF patients is the reduction of AF-related symptoms,&#xD;
      resulting in an improvement of quality of life. The effect was shown to be significantly&#xD;
      higher compared with conventional medical treatment. In contrast, there is no evidence for a&#xD;
      substantial effect of PVI on hard clinical endpoints. The recent large randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial CABANA (Catheter ABlation vs. ANtiarrhythmic Drug Therapy for Atrial Fibrillation) did&#xD;
      not show a reduction of the primary composite endpoint of death, disabling stroke, serious&#xD;
      bleeding and cardiac arrest in the intention-to-treat analysis although the results are&#xD;
      highly controversial due to the high crossover rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to now, the only patient population with evidence for a prognostic benefit of PVI in&#xD;
      symptomatic AF are patients with a heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). In&#xD;
      the CASTLE-AF trial, a relative risk reduction for all-cause mortality of 47% was shown for&#xD;
      HFrEF patients with AF ablation compared with conventional treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7-Day Holter monitorring in patients 6 month after treatment with PVI revealed a significant&#xD;
      increase in asymptomatic AF episodes. Furthermore, the MANTRA-PAF randomised trial (Medical&#xD;
      Antiarrhythmic Treatment or Radiofrequency Ablation in Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation) failed&#xD;
      to prove a difference in AF recurrence after PVI compared to medical therapy in the first 18&#xD;
      month of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This raises concerns that the symptomatic improvement might be the result of a placebo&#xD;
      effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PVI-SHAM-AF is a prospective, double-blinded, sham-controlled, randomized, multicenter trial&#xD;
      whose aim is to compare the effect of catheter-based ablation on patient reported outcomes&#xD;
      based on common AF questionnaires with a sham procedure. 260 patients without previous PVI or&#xD;
      surgical treatment of atrial fibrillation, a LVEF &gt;35% and an indication for interventional&#xD;
      treatment of AF with pulmonary vein isolation based on current Guidelines (ESC 2020) will be&#xD;
      enrolled and randomized 2:1 to undergo either PVI or sham procedure. The latter will include&#xD;
      deep analgosedation as performed during standard PVI treatment for at least one hour,&#xD;
      introduction of femoral sheets and if necessary electrical cardioversion in patients with&#xD;
      persisting AF. No catheter will be placed within the participant. The official procedure&#xD;
      protocol will include no details about the intervention; postinterventional care will be&#xD;
      conducted independent of whether a catheter ablation or sham procedure was performed, based&#xD;
      on the respective PVI protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will be followed up for one year with visit at 3, 6 and 12 months. Each of these&#xD;
      visits include questionnaires for AF related Symptoms (AFEQT, SF-36 and EQ-5D); 7-Day Holter&#xD;
      Monitoring will be performed 6 months after the procedure. Participants will be unblinded&#xD;
      after 12 months. The primary endpoint will be the difference of AFEQT sum scores evaluated at&#xD;
      6 months to baseline.&#xD;
