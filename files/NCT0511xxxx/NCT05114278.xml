  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims is to evaluate the efficacy of intravenous iron supplementation on celiac&#xD;
      disease remission (total intestinal mucosal recovery). This randomized multicenter trial&#xD;
      compare the administration of intravenous iron by infusion (Ferinject©: 15 mg/kg in NaCl&#xD;
      solution in 30 min) and oral iron in combination; to patients receive only oral iron as&#xD;
      standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first benefit with IV Iron supplementation is to correct iron deficiency more rapidly&#xD;
      than oral iron alone because of trouble of absorption in case of intestinal villous atrophy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Celiac disease is an autoimmune-like disorder induced in genetically predisposed individuals&#xD;
      by dietary proteins from wheat (gluten). Its frequency reaches 1% in Europe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In celiac patients, gluten induces small intestinal villous atrophy and, as a consequence,&#xD;
      malnutrition. Celiac disease treatment relies on a long-life strict gluten-free diet that&#xD;
      allows clinical and histological recovery and prevents long-term complications (autoimmune&#xD;
      diseases, osteoporosis and malignancies). Remission is attested by total villous recovery on&#xD;
      duodenal biopsy performed after one year of gluten free diet. Yet, in adults, systematic&#xD;
      follow-up of biopsies for several years after gluten free diet initiation has recently&#xD;
      revealed persistent villous atrophy in more than 40 % of cases with an increased risk in&#xD;
      older patients (up to 56%). Lack of mucosal healing has been associated with the risk of&#xD;
      complications in celiac, notably a risk factor for fractures and lymphoma. It is therefore&#xD;
      necessary to define strategies to obtain and accelerate full recovery. Iron deficiency is&#xD;
      strongly associated with celiac disease and is generally viewed as a consequence of small&#xD;
      intestinal lesions and a symptom of malnutrition. Our preliminary clinical retrospective&#xD;
      study showed more frequent iron deficiency anemia in celiac patients with (20/70; 29%) than&#xD;
      without (11/88; 12.5%) villous atrophy (p = 0.015; OR: 2.78). Our previous experimental study&#xD;
      suggests that iron deficiency may sustain tissue damage and delay mucosal recovery in celiac&#xD;
      disease. Indeed the transferrin receptor (CD71) is overexpressed in the gut epithelium in&#xD;
      case of iron deficiency and can interact with secretory IgA1 present in large amounts in the&#xD;
      intestinal lumen of CD patients. Crosslinking of CD71 by polymeric IgA1 can induce production&#xD;
      of inflammatory cytokines. Our working hypothesis is therefore that iron deficiency maintains&#xD;
      aberrant expression of CD71 at the gut epithelial surface that sustains intestinal&#xD;
      inflammation and epithelial damage. Iron supplementation of celiac patients with villous&#xD;
      atrophy and iron deficiency may accelerate mucosal healing, villous recovery and remission.&#xD;
