  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are few devices currently on the market claiming to improve sleep. This study will&#xD;
      investigate the efficacy of phototherapy on improving sleep, in the form of a wearable neck&#xD;
      device used at night.&#xD;

      This study will investigate the efficacy of phototherapy on improving sleep, in the form of a&#xD;
      wearable neck device used at night. Phototherapy has been shown to improve chronic pain,&#xD;
      cerebral blood flow, neurological function, and capillary growth in skeletal muscle. A device&#xD;
      worn at night may improve sleep onset, total sleep time, or modify sleep architecture.&#xD;
      Improved cardiovascular function may facilitate a decrease in core body temperature needed&#xD;
      for sleep onset. Relaxation from direct heat may help to decrease cortisol levels, thus&#xD;
      reducing the number of night-time arousals. It may also decrease circulating levels of&#xD;
      norepinephrine (NE), one of the main neurotransmitters involved in arousal. The aim of this&#xD;
      study is to evaluate if the device worn leads to greater next-day wellbeing and cognitive&#xD;
      function as a result of increased slow-wave activity.&#xD;
