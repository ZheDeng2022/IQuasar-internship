  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with inflammatory diseases are often treated with medications that act to suppress the&#xD;
      immune-system, increasing the risk of catching infections. Consequently, vaccination with the&#xD;
      pneumonia and seasonal flu vaccines is recommended for them. They were also prioritised to&#xD;
      receive the COVID-19 vaccines early in the national rollout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the uptake of the pneumonia and seasonal flu vaccines among this group is lower than&#xD;
      ideal. There may be many reasons why they do or do not seek to be vaccinated for these&#xD;
      infections, such as the belief it may cause their disease to flare up or lack of knowledge of&#xD;
      vaccines effectiveness. Anecdotally there was a high uptake of COVID-19 vaccines in adults&#xD;
      with inflammatory conditions, however, concerns about vaccine-induced disease flare-ups and&#xD;
      reports of complications deterred some from being vaccinated. A better understanding of why&#xD;
      people do and do not seek vaccination may result in more targeted messaging for patients to&#xD;
      help overcome vaccine hesitancy for these infectious diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to explore the drivers and barriers to being vaccinated among adults with&#xD;
      common inflammatory conditions and on immune-suppressing medication. They will be invited to&#xD;
      participate in a single, semi-structured interview. Interviews will be face-to-face, by&#xD;
      telephone or video-call, last up to one hour, and digitally audio-recorded. They will explore&#xD;
      participants' understanding of pneumonia, seasonal flu and COVID-19 and the risk they pose to&#xD;
      their health, their understanding of vaccinations, beliefs of the benefits and risks of&#xD;
      vaccinations for these infections, and reasons for seeking or not seeking vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Findings will inform messaging about being vaccinated for these infections in patient&#xD;
      education leaflets, such as those by patient charities regularly provided at speciality&#xD;
      clinics. They will also be disseminated to healthcare professionals to help them better&#xD;
      understand the drivers and barriers to vaccination.&#xD;
