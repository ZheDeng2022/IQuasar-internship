  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with increased mortality and morbidity, and is a&#xD;
      dominant, yet preventable, cause of cardioembolic stroke, which has more severe outcomes than&#xD;
      other ischaemic stroke causes if left untreated. Approximately 10% of ischemic strokes are&#xD;
      associated with AF (AF) first diagnosed at the time of stroke. Detecting asymptomatic AF&#xD;
      would provide an opportunity to prevent these strokes by instituting appropriate&#xD;
      anticoagulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early diagnosis of AF might enable oral anticoagulant therapy and prevent unwanted&#xD;
      consequences of undetected disease, leading to the suggestion that screening for AF might be&#xD;
      beneficial in populations at risk. However, there is still debate about whether&#xD;
      screen-detected AF bears a similar stroke and mortality risk profile to clinically detected&#xD;
      AF, particularly when AF screening is done at a higher intensity than single-time point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The absence of studies reporting on hard clinical endpoints in AF screening has led to&#xD;
      differences in recommendations globally. Most notably, systematic screening for AF is to be&#xD;
      considered according to 2020 European guidelines, whereas the US Preventive Services Task&#xD;
      Force concluded that current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and&#xD;
      harms of screening for AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of screen-detected AF strongly depends on the population screened and&#xD;
      duration/intensity of screening. Single-time point screening of a general population ≥65&#xD;
      years of age detects undiagnosed AF in 1.4%, and the AF detected is largely persistent. In a&#xD;
      large population-based study of individuals 75 to 76 years of age, a more intense 2-week&#xD;
      screening program using twice-daily intermittent handheld ECG recordings identified AF in&#xD;
      3.0% (0.5% on the initial ECG4). The identical protocol restricted to those with ≥1&#xD;
      additional stroke risk factor identified 7.4% with AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was designed in to two arms. The purpose of Arm 1 is to upgrade the artificial&#xD;
      intelligence by collecting the continued ECG monitoring data in patients with previous&#xD;
      diagnosed AF. The purpose of Arm 2 is to investigate the detection rate of AF using&#xD;
      systematic, intensive AF screening with continuous ECG monitoring and the rate of clinical&#xD;
      outcome in individuals at high risk during one year follow-up.&#xD;
