      The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a short treatment period with Balance&#xD;
      Body Tape on the intensity of perceived neck, shoulder and back pain and neck posture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method 26 subjects who reported being university students or having a sedentary work and&#xD;
      experiencing pain in neck, back or shoulders were randomized into intervention- (n=12) and&#xD;
      control group (n=14).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group received a three-week treatment with BBT, the control group received&#xD;
      no treatment. A questionnaire regarding pain, including a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS)&#xD;
      measuring pain intensity, and a Photographic posture analysis measurement (PPAM) of habitual&#xD;
      sitting posture were accomplished before and after the intervention for both groups.&#xD;
      WilcoxonÂ´s signed rank test and Mann-Whitney U test was used to assess intra- and between&#xD;
      group differences respectively. The relationship between pain intensity and CV-angle was&#xD;
      assessed using Spearman's rank-order correlation.&#xD;
