  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      South Africa recorded it's first COVID19 case on March 5, 2020. In response to the COVID19&#xD;
      outbreak WHO recommendations, South Africa implemented non-pharmaceutical recommendations.&#xD;
      The major risk mitigation factors recommended by WHO and others - physical distancing and&#xD;
      hygiene - are extremely difficult to implement in much of Africa. We will conduct a&#xD;
      randomised controlled trial to investigate the effect of an infection mitigation intervention&#xD;
      to assess the effect on household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in household settings with an&#xD;
      index patient diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 positive.&#xD;

      The major risk mitigation factors recommended by WHO and others - physical distancing and&#xD;
      hygiene - are extremely difficult to implement in much of Africa. Newly diagnosed SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      index patients will be identified and recruited from a mobile clinic and local community&#xD;
      clinics conducting SARS-CoV-2 testing. Index cases and their households will be invited to&#xD;
      enroll. The study design is a type 2 hybrid cluster (household) randomised controlled trial,&#xD;
      with outcomes assessed on index patients and their household contacts. 120 consecutively&#xD;
      newly diagnosed index patients (GeneXpert SARS-CoV-2 PCR) and up to 6- 8 household contacts&#xD;
      will be invited to participate in the trial as part of the prospective observational study&#xD;
      evaluating transmission and symptoms. After completing consent, households will be randomised&#xD;
      in a 1:1 ratio in blocks of 10 (60 households per group). Klipfontein is a resource-limited,&#xD;
      densely populated, high HIV/TB disease burden areas in Cape Town. Newly diagnosed COVID19&#xD;
      cases will be identified from two sources: screening conducted in DTHF mobile screening units&#xD;
      and local public sector clinics working closely with DTHF. Consecutive cases (n=120 cases and&#xD;
      households) will be invited to participate in the randomised trial and prospective&#xD;
      longitudinal follow up of up to 6- 8 household contacts. The contacts will be followed up&#xD;
      after informed consent to SARS-CoV-2 screening, symptomatic questionnaires weekly up to 1&#xD;
      month. After enrolment, the household will be randomised to the infection mitigation&#xD;
      intervention or enhanced usual care messaging. Baseline demographic, household&#xD;
      characteristics questionnaire will be administered, and each household occupant invited to&#xD;
      participate. Following consent procedures, household contacts (HHC) will be screened at&#xD;
      baseline and weekly for 4 weeks for evidence of COVID infection. Specifically, the research&#xD;
      team will conduct SARS-CoV-2 GeneXpert PCR testing and antibody serology. They will collate&#xD;
      self- administered daily symptom checks on a weekly basis. We will recruit 120 households&#xD;
      over 1-11 months. We will initiate a prospective longitudinal follow up of the household&#xD;
      contacts of each case for 4 weeks in each case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will calculate proportion of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from index cases in each household&#xD;
      over 4- week period and describe the proportion of symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      infection in a high density, low resourced community. Investigate the impact of the infection&#xD;
      mitigation intervention by comparing incidence in households randomised to intervention&#xD;
      versus standard of care. Secondary outcomes for the trial will include clinical outcomes&#xD;
      (hospitalisations, death), linkages to care for people, psychosocial functioning, and stigma.&#xD;
