  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational, open labeled study. The study aims to evaluate the capability of&#xD;
      SenseGuard™ (SG) non-invasive wearable device, to detect, post-hoc, early respiratory changes&#xD;
      due to exacerbation by daily monitoring of subjects with COPD, at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with COPD, that were discharged following hospitalization due to AECOPD are most&#xD;
      susceptible to experience another exacerbation during the first 6 months post admission.&#xD;
      Hence, subjects that were discharged from the hospital due to AECOPD during the last 3 months&#xD;
      are eligible to the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the study subject will be monitored daily for up to 6 months. Subject will perform 2&#xD;
      daily measurements of tidal breathing with SG, for 8 minutes each. Measurements are performed&#xD;
      at the same time window every day; in the morning, before any treatment, and in the evening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring will be continued during exacerbations and hospitalization if and when occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject will complete a weekly online COPD symptoms assessment questionnaire, sent by email&#xD;
      or a text massage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject will report the clinical team about any increase of respiratory symptoms that may&#xD;
      lead to exacerbation. Subject will get treatment for confirmed exacerbation according to the&#xD;
      Standard of Care. Each case of symptoms and/or confirmed exacerbation will be documented in&#xD;
      the CRF and reported to NanoVation team within 24 hours from onset. The daily data obtained&#xD;
      by SG, prior to the exacerbation, will be analyzed to detect early respiratory change&#xD;
      associated with this exacerbation. This information is critical for SG data interpretation&#xD;
      and for the development of early alert for AECOPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NanoVation team will provide all subjects with the following: training to use SG, technical&#xD;
      support in any case of a problem with the device and reminders to use the SG in case of&#xD;
      reduced compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study will include 3 visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 - Enrolment visit (Day 0): will be conducted during subject hospitalization or at&#xD;
      discharge day, or by inviting eligible subjects to this visit (subjects who were hospitalized&#xD;
      during the last 3 months due to AECOPD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolment of eligible subjects by the clinical team will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of medical record and diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of Inclusion/ exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject receives explanation about study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject signs the Informed Consent form (ICF).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject performs baseline Spirometry test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject fills a baseline COPD symptoms assessment questionnaire (CSAQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Next visits are scheduled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject receives the SG home kit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject is trained for self-operation of SG measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject's data is documented in the CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2- Follow up visit (at 3 months) Subject will have a routine clinical follow up 3&#xD;
      months after discharge and recruitment to the study. During this visit, subject will undergo&#xD;
      a routine spirometry breathing test and complete a usability questionnaire evaluating the&#xD;
      daily experience with SG measurement. All data will be documented in the CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3- End of study visit (at 6 months) Subject will have a routine clinical follow up,&#xD;
      Subject will undergo a routine spirometry breathing test and will complete a SG usability&#xD;
      questionnaire. Subject will return the SG home kit and all data will be documented in the&#xD;
      CRF.&#xD;

    <description>SG is a wireless, wearable medical device, which includes nano-based sensors. It can seamlessly measure patient's tidal breathing during daily activities. SG extracts series of critical respiratory parameters, including; Respiration Rate (RR), Inhalation and Exhalation duration and ratio (I/E), as well as novel biomarkers. SG parameters are applicable to evaluate COPD patients' condition, or for monitoring patients with other respiratory conditions.&#xD;
SG components are:&#xD;
RSM (Respiratory Sensing Module): non-invasive module with sensors that can detect the exhaled humidity and condensation. The RSM is a non-sterile, disposable, single patient use.&#xD;
ECU (Electronic Control Unit): a re-usable, wireless data acquisition and transmission unit. The ECU is connected to the RSM during the measurement and transmits the data via Bluetooth to the SG software.&#xD;
SenseGuard™ Software: for data management, acquisition, processing, logging and presentation of the digital respiratory signals.</description>
