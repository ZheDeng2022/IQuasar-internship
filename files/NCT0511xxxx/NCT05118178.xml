      Cardiological complications of oncological treatment, including the most serious of them&#xD;
      cardiotoxicity and heart failure, constitute a significant and still unsolved clinical&#xD;
      problem. A history of hypercholesterolaemia and coronary artery disease in cancer patients,&#xD;
      is one of the risk factors for cardiotoxicity. In recent years, a protective effect of statin&#xD;
      treatment on the development of heart failure in cancer patients has been observed. ANTEC&#xD;
      (Atherosclerosis iN chemoTherapy-rElated Cardiotoxicity) is a prospective observational study&#xD;
      aimed at assessing the impact of the advancement of atherosclerotic lesions in the coronary&#xD;
      arteries assessed in computed tomography on the development of left ventricular systolic&#xD;
      dysfunction in cancer patients at high risk of myocardial damage. A group of 80 patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with cancer before starting high-dose anthracycline chemotherapy (doxorubicin ≥ 240&#xD;
      mg / m2 or epirubicin ≥ 540 mg / m2 body weight), without a history of heart failure and&#xD;
      coronary artery disease, will be included in the study. The total follow-up of patients was&#xD;
      planned for 12 months. The primary endpoint is time to onset of left ventricular systolic&#xD;
      dysfunction as assessed by echocardiography. The secondary composite endpoints include&#xD;
      all-cause death, cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Additionally, the&#xD;
      assessment will include: the severity of atherosclerotic changes in the coronary arteries and&#xD;
      the calcification index in computed tomography, the percentage decrease in left ventricular&#xD;
      ejection fraction, GLS (global longitudinal strain) and MWI (myocardial work index) in&#xD;
      echocardiography, and changes in the concentration of biomarkers involved in inflammatory and&#xD;
      atherosclerotic processes. This is the first study of this type, which we hope will&#xD;
      contribute to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of cardiotoxicity development and&#xD;
      to changing the standards of management of oncological patients and improving survival in&#xD;
      this group of patients.&#xD;

      Cardiological complications of oncological treatment, including the most serious:&#xD;
      cardiotoxicity and heart failure, remains the most dangerous cardiological complication of&#xD;
      oncological treatment and are still unsolved clinical problem. The fear of the toxic effects&#xD;
      of anti-cancer drugs may lead to the modification or abandonment of oncological treatment,&#xD;
      and consequently shorten the survival time of cancer patients.&#xD;

        The study will include patients with diagnosed cancer, diagnosed and qualified for further&#xD;
        systemic treatment at the National Institute of Oncology in Warsaw. Patients must give&#xD;
        informed and voluntary consent to participate in the study and meet all the conditions for&#xD;
        inclusion in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        The size of the study group was calculated at 80 people. The estimated group size is based&#xD;
        on the Cochran-Armitage test for the existence of a trend for a variable on an ordinal&#xD;
        scale. The one-sided test was taken into account (alternative hypothesis - increase in the&#xD;
        incidence of cardiotoxicity with the severity of atherosclerotic lesions versus null&#xD;
        hypothesis - no effect). Assumptions: power - 80%, level of statistical significance -&#xD;
        0.05, one-tailed test for the presence of a trend.&#xD;
