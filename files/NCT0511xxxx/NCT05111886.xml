  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Child and adolescent behavioral health problems are related to the leading causes of youth&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. Parent-focused preventive interventions, such as GenerationPMTO&#xD;
      (GenPMTO), effectively prevent behavioral health problems such as depression and conduct&#xD;
      disorders. Unfortunately, parenting programs are not widely available nor well-attended.&#xD;
      Pediatric primary care (PC) is a non-stigmatizing setting with nearly universal reach and,&#xD;
      therefore, an ideal access point to increase availability. However, PC personnel are not&#xD;
      trained to address behavioral health topics. Also, typical referral practices are inadequate.&#xD;
      There is a need to develop effective referral practices in conjunction with increasing&#xD;
      availability. There are also logistical barriers to attending in-person parenting programs,&#xD;
      like the need for childcare and a large time-commitment. There is a need to overcome these&#xD;
      logistical barriers with more accessible programs. The long-term goal is to prevent&#xD;
      significant behavioral health problems by increasing access to GenPMTO.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Specifically, the investigators propose engaging parents of 3 to 5-year-olds with moderate&#xD;
      externalizing or internalizing symptoms through pediatric primary care (PC); PC personnel&#xD;
      will refer parents to a community therapist who will deliver a novel brief eHealth (i.e.&#xD;
      online video-chat) model of GenPMTO. Collaborating clinics are part of a Federally Qualified&#xD;
      Health Center (FQHC), allowing for access to an under-served population of parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this project is to test a brief eHealth version of GenPMTO,&#xD;
      delivered to parents online by community therapists (Aim 3). Brief online delivery can&#xD;
      overcome logistical barriers, thereby increasing access while maintaining effectiveness. An&#xD;
      additional objective is to develop (Aim 1) and test (Aim 2) a brief training for PC personnel&#xD;
      and a referral process to equip them to effectively refer parents to eHealth GenPMTO, thereby&#xD;
      increasing access to needed services through effective engagement in a trusted setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve these objectives, the following aims will be completed. Aim 1 is a development&#xD;
      phase to inform Aim 2 components. Aims 2 and 3 run concurrently in the study; the order of&#xD;
      the aims reflects the patient flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Develop a referral process and a training for PC personnel by gathering mixed-method&#xD;
      expert and stakeholder input and feedback. The investigators will present a proposed referral&#xD;
      process and PC personnel training, and solicit feedback via the Nominal Group Technique from&#xD;
      four expert groups: (1) researchers and implementers (n=6) with experience delivering other&#xD;
      parenting interventions though primary care in the U.S., (2) primary care personnel (n=9)&#xD;
      from FQHC primary care clinics, (3) personnel from British Columbia (n=6) who have&#xD;
      implemented brief GenPMTO over the telephone with parents referred by primary care, and (4)&#xD;
      parents (n=6) who receive care from an FQHC. One key question that will be addressed is which&#xD;
      PC personnel (e.g., provider, nurse) is best suited to have the referring conversation with&#xD;
      parents and receive the training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Evaluate the referral process and conduct a pilot test of the PC personnel training&#xD;
      within FQHC clinics. PC personnel (n=35) within two FQHC primary care clinics will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to receive communication skills training or a control condition. Control&#xD;
      group personnel will receive a written description of the referral process but no training.&#xD;
      Aim 2a: Using a sequential mixed-methods approach with PC personnel, the investigators will&#xD;
      evaluate the acceptability and appropriateness of the referral process and the training. The&#xD;
      investigators will also interview parents who do not complete a referral (n=10) to examine&#xD;
      the acceptability of the referral process and identify remaining barriers to engagement. Aim&#xD;
      2b: The investigators will pilot test the effectiveness of the training to increase PC&#xD;
      personnel's communication skills. The investigators will also use EHR data to pilot test the&#xD;
      effect of the training on parent engagement in GenPMTO by comparing the rates of referral and&#xD;
      engagement among patients who had an appointment with personnel in the training arm to those&#xD;
      seeing control personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Pilot test a brief, eHealth version of GenerationPMTO for moderate externalizing or&#xD;
      internalizing symptoms. The personnel described in Aim 2 will refer parents to GenPMTO. Aim&#xD;
      3a: With the referred parents, the investigators will conduct a pilot RCT to examine change&#xD;
      in parents' (n=60) parenting locus of control, self-reported parenting behaviors, and child&#xD;
      externalizing and internalizing, all of which have been shown to predict later changes in&#xD;
      child behavioral health outcomes. The investigators will examine the mediating effect of&#xD;
      parenting changes on changes in child outcomes. These effect sizes will also be compared to&#xD;
      effect sizes from other GenPMTO studies to determine if this preliminary assessment aligns&#xD;
      with findings from other versions of GenPMTO. Aim 3b: Using a sequential mixed-methods&#xD;
      approach, the investigators will assess the acceptability, feasibility, and appropriateness&#xD;
      of brief, eHealth GenPMTO among therapists (n=15) and a sub-sample of parents (n=14).&#xD;

    <description>The training will focus on communication skills based on key constructs in the Health Belief Model and motivation/resistance research (described in section A3), the training will focus on: (1) conveying the benefits of parenting programs, (2) knowledge of and responses to common perceived barriers to attending parenting programs, and (3) skills and strategies to effectively motivate and refer parents in ways that are least likely to elicit resistance. The in-person training will last 60-90 minutes. It will include a theoretical background and experiential learning; each step of the referral process will be demonstrated and role-played. The investigators will work to ensure that personnel receive continuing education credits for the training.</description>
