  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study explores how psychosocial factors (e.g., chronic stress, depression) may lead to&#xD;
      liver disease progression such as liver cirrhosis or liver cancer among Korean American&#xD;
      chronic hepatitis B infection patients. Gathering health information over time from Korean&#xD;
      Americans with chronic hepatitis B infection may help doctors find better methods of&#xD;
      treatment and on-going care.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the prevalence of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) phenotype and liver disease&#xD;
      severity at enrollment visit, and model how multiple social-environmental, psychosocial,&#xD;
      behavioral, clinical and biological attributes are associated with variation in CHB phenotype&#xD;
      and disease severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To identify how these same attributes are associated with disease progression over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To examine the moderating effects of these multi-level factors on the relationship between&#xD;
      liver disease progression and adverse liver disease outcome (e.g., hepatocellular carcinoma&#xD;
      [HCC]), as well as mediating effects of liver disease progression on the relationship between&#xD;
      psychosocial factors and liver cancer or death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Using an explanatory mixed methods approach, to understand the care-seeking behaviors, and&#xD;
      dynamics of care, within an ethnically concordant liver disease care model, and how these&#xD;
      factors may have both direct and mediational effects on adherence, treatment effectiveness,&#xD;
      and adverse disease outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients participate in interviews over 20-40 minutes and undergo collection of hair samples&#xD;
      at baseline and 18-24 months. Patients' medical records are also reviewed.&#xD;
