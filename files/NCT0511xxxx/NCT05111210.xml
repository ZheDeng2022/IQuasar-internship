  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study involving humans, of the interventional type with minimal risks and&#xD;
      constraints (RIPH2). It is a monocentric, non randomized prospective study aiming to better&#xD;
      understand the mechanisms of the response to anti-IL-23 biologics in psoriasis patients&#xD;
      attending the dermatology department of hospital Cochin (APHP).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to study the cellular and molecular mechanisms in patients&#xD;
      receiving anti-IL-23 biologics as treatment for cutaneous psoriasis, in order to improve the&#xD;
      understanding of the role of IL-23/IL-17 axis in this pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This objective is detailed in three specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Define the effects of IL-23 on gene expression and cytokine production in innate and&#xD;
           adaptive T lymphocytes in patients with skin psoriasis and correlate it with the&#xD;
           patient's genotype&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify at the single cell level the cells expressing IL-23R and/or producing IL-17 in&#xD;
           the skin of patients with skin psoriasis;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Characterize the in vivo effects of anti-IL-23 therapy on the immune responses of&#xD;
           patients with skin psoriasis, by analysing gene expression and protein secretion in&#xD;
           whole blood cultures before and after treatment; The secondary objective of this study&#xD;
           is to identify mechanisms of non-response to anti-IL-23 therapy in cutaneous psoriasis&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population to be included are patients affected by cutaneous psoriasis, requiring&#xD;
      systemic biological treatment and attended to in the Dermatology Department of the Cochin&#xD;
      Hospital. Patients will be divided into two groups: Group 1 patients will participate once&#xD;
      before initiation of therapy, Group 2 will participate before and after initiation of&#xD;
      anti-IL-23 biologic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: 10 patients with cutaneous psoriasis for the phenotypic and transcriptional analyses&#xD;
      of T cell populations in peripheral blood. These patients will be sampled once before&#xD;
      initiation of biotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Group 2: 40 patients with a medical decision to treat cutaneous psoriasis with an&#xD;
      anti-IL-23 biologic. These patients will be sampled twice (before and after initiation of&#xD;
      therapy), for the analysis of blood immune cell populations using spectral flow cytometry,&#xD;
      and immune responses using whole blood cultures. Skin biopsies will be obtained from a subset&#xD;
      of 10 patients to analyse the skin transcriptome, before and after treatment with anti-IL-23&#xD;
      biologics.&#xD;
