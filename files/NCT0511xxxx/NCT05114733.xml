    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of InVEST (Individualized Vocational and&#xD;
      Educational Support and Training) for CHR-P (clinical high risk for psychosis) to address&#xD;
      specific role functioning difficulties associated with the CHR-P phase. Our specific goals&#xD;
      are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Part 1: Preliminary open trial of InVEST (n = 8) to collect preliminary feasibility and&#xD;
           acceptability data by providing the intervention, administering assessments, and&#xD;
           collecting focus group and self-report feedback from open trial participants. The open&#xD;
           trial phase will help to refine recruitment approaches and to modify the treatment&#xD;
           manual as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Part 2: Preliminary randomized controlled trial of InVEST vs. Delayed InVEST (DI) to&#xD;
           explore preliminary evidence of efficacy of InVEST vs. DI (n = 30). The investigators&#xD;
           hope to gain understanding of the feasibility of InVEST and the study's assessment&#xD;
           procedures, and to gain a preliminary understanding of the intervention's efficacy for&#xD;
           functioning difficulties experienced by young people at CHR-P.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      InVEST is a novel intervention that aims to target three clusters of mechanisms believed to&#xD;
      be key in contributing to increasing functional impairment in CHR-P: 1) executive functioning&#xD;
      (a cognitive mechanism), 2) increased stress sensitivity (an emotional mechanism), and 3)&#xD;
      task initiation difficulties (a behavioral mechanism). Conceptually, these mechanisms are&#xD;
      consistent with a CBT conceptualization of role functioning impairment, and the strategies to&#xD;
      target each mechanism will be adapted based on existing evidence-based interventions combined&#xD;
      with clinical expertise in CHR-P treatment. Finally, our proposed project is based on robust&#xD;
      scientific evidence supporting the need for early intervention, targeting functional&#xD;
      impairment and related risk factors in individuals at CHR-P.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be organized in two parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: Manual development and a preliminary open-trial (n = 8) to guide the development and&#xD;
      refinement of InVEST through coach experiences and study participant feedback. Participants&#xD;
      will complete the intervention and then a post-intervention focus group, providing data on&#xD;
      the feasibility of InVEST and to direct the development of the InVEST intervention manual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: A small, randomized trial comparing InVEST treatment (2 groups, n = 15 each).&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized using a delayed treatment design, with half of participants&#xD;
      randomized into InVEST and half randomized into a 4-month Delayed InVEST (DI; 4 month wait to&#xD;
      start). Primary outcome measures will include CHR-P symptoms; global role functioning;&#xD;
      executive functioning; stress sensitivity; task initiation; hopelessness; and suicidality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overview of Intervention: InVEST for CHR-P&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will develop and test the feasibility of InVEST, an educational and&#xD;
      vocational functioning intervention designed for youth at CHR-P, ages 12-18. InVEST&#xD;
      streamlines CBT-P principles into an intervention model geared towards vocational and&#xD;
      educational functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      InVEST is delivered individually by a &quot;coach&quot; (BA-level clinician) who can meet with youth at&#xD;
      the clinic, by phone/ video, or in meetings in the community to provide support for&#xD;
      implementing goals. Generally, sessions are once a week for one hour, but can be adjusted&#xD;
      depending on client needs. The coach communicates with and serves as a member of a&#xD;
      coordinated specialty care team (CSC) for CHR-P and collaborates with the client's individual&#xD;
      therapist. The coach begins by identifying the youth's individualized goals and notes any&#xD;
      difficulties with executive functioning, task initiation, and/or frustration tolerance. The&#xD;
      coach then works with the client and therapist to develop a plan for taking action to&#xD;
      accomplish goals and for practicing skills for improving organization, task initiation and&#xD;
      managing frustration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: Development Phase/Open Trial Developing InVEST Manual: The investigators will develop&#xD;
      an InVEST manual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: During the first year, the investigators will recruit 8 young people meeting&#xD;
      broad CHR-P criteria from CEDAR or CHR-P research programs. Meeting broad diagnostic CHR-P&#xD;
      criteria will be pre-determined through routine clinic assessments. Releases of Information's&#xD;
      will be obtained from all participants upon recruitment to allow sharing of eligibility&#xD;
      information for study recruitment. The investigators will slightly stagger these participants&#xD;
      into 2 overlapping cohorts, to permit modifications to the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Refine and elaborate InVEST: Refinement will be an iterative process guided by our ongoing&#xD;
      experiences in each of the stages. Additionally, the investigators will hold a focus group&#xD;
      with the open trial participants, to inform refining the manual, particularly the initial&#xD;
      InVEST assessment, which aims to guide how to individualize the intervention to particular&#xD;
      client needs. The group will hold a meeting after each stage with all investigators and&#xD;
      consultants to review and further refine the manual, including at the end of the development&#xD;
      phase. The investigators will make changes to increase InVEST's acceptability, efficacy,&#xD;
      efficiency, clarity, and developmental appropriateness. The open trial will inform what&#xD;
      protocol accommodations are needed for younger adolescents, changes in content to sessions,&#xD;
      whether and how age affects acceptability and feasibility, and whether the intervention needs&#xD;
      to be simplified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments: Participants and a parent/ caregiver will complete 2 assessments&#xD;
      (screening/baseline and post-treatment). Given our small sample size, treatment feasibility&#xD;
      and accessibility are our primary outcomes. Our secondary outcome is role functioning. The&#xD;
      investigators will acquire demographic variables and diagnosis from CEDAR records, and the&#xD;
      investigators will conduct assessments on the following constructs: CHR-P symptoms; executive&#xD;
      functioning; stress sensitivity; task initiation; hopelessness; and suicidality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focus Group Post-intervention, all open trial participants will be invited to participate in&#xD;
      a focus group (n=8) to provide feedback on the intervention, and to inform manual&#xD;
      development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: Pilot Study Phase&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: The goals of the pilot study are to a) collect data on the feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of InVEST, b) test and refine the provider training procedures, c) refine and&#xD;
      pilot test provider adherence and competency measures, and d) preliminary investigation of&#xD;
      InVEST's primary outcome (role functioning) and mechanisms (executive functioning, stress&#xD;
      sensitivity, and task initiation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatments: After obtaining all relevant consent and assent forms and completing their&#xD;
      baseline assessment, participants will be randomized to either InVEST, or to a waitlist,&#xD;
      Delayed Invest (DI) condition. Participants in the intervention condition will receive 4&#xD;
      months of InVEST treatment, then complete a post-treatment assessment and then a 4-month&#xD;
      follow-up assessment. Delayed Invest participants will participate in their usual treatment&#xD;
      without the addition of InVEST for their 4 months. Then, they will complete the 4-month&#xD;
      assessment and begin working with an InVEST coach for the next 4 months, followed by a&#xD;
      post-InVEST assessment. As a result, all participants will receive 3 assessments (which will&#xD;
      allow the study assessment clinician to remain blind to study condition). Additionally, this&#xD;
      procedure will allow for some consideration of change during the Delayed InVEST period, and&#xD;
      for some consideration of stability after the intervention ends, and will permit all&#xD;
      participants to receive the intervention. InVEST will be implemented as a 4-month&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments: Participants and a parent/ caregiver will complete 3 assessments (intervention:&#xD;
      screening/baseline, post-treatment, 4-month follow-up; waitlist: screening/baseline,&#xD;
      pre-treatment, post-treatment). Given our small sample size, treatment feasibility and&#xD;
      accessibility are our primary outcomes. Our secondary outcome is role functioning.&#xD;
