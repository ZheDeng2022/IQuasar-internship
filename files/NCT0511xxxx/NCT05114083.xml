      Dr. Russell Traister, et al, describes a symptom scoring system based on retrospective chart&#xD;
      review to help identify subjects with VCD. Dr. Traister assigned the following symptom&#xD;
      scores: dysphonia (2), throat tightness (4), sensitivity to odors (3) and absence of wheezing&#xD;
      (2). Patients scoring 4 or more points have a positive predictive value of 96% and a negative&#xD;
      predictive value of 77% for VCD. This prospective study will look at a population of patients&#xD;
      presenting to a large tertiary care referral center for symptoms of cough. Patients seen at&#xD;
      the &quot;Cough Clinic&quot; are evaluated by a Pulmonologist and an Otolaryngologist. Each patient&#xD;
      undergoes pulmonary function testing and VLS testing as part of the diagnostic workup. For&#xD;
      this study the history would be expanded to include the 4 specific symptoms: dysphonia,&#xD;
      throat tightness, sensitivity to odors and absence of wheezing. The symptoms will be scored&#xD;
      and compared against the results of diagnostic testing to determine if these symptoms help&#xD;
      predict those with vocal cord dysfunction (VCD).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vocal cord dysfunction (VCD) refers to the abnormal adduction of the vocal cords during&#xD;
      breathing resulting in extrathoracic airway obstruction. These patients often complain of&#xD;
      wheezing, cough and shortness of breath. Symptoms of VCD mimic asthma often leading to&#xD;
      misdiagnosis and exposure to unneeded medications. Speech therapy rather than medications is&#xD;
      the mainstay of treatment for VCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gold standard diagnostic tool for detection of VCD is direct visualization of the vocal&#xD;
      cords using flexible video assisted fiberoptic laryngoscopy (VLS). VCD is present if the&#xD;
      cords constrict greater than 50% during the respiratory cycle. VLS is well tolerated however&#xD;
      it is an invasive procedure and costly. Identifying patients who most likely have VCD for VLS&#xD;
      testing would reduce health related expense and avoid unnecessary procedures. Dr. Russell&#xD;
      Traister, et al, describes a symptom scoring system based on retrospective chart review to&#xD;
      help identify subjects with VCD. Dr. Traister assigned the following symptom scores:&#xD;
      dysphonia (2), throat tightness (4), sensitivity to odors (3) and absence of wheezing (2).&#xD;
      Patients scoring 4 or more points have a positive predictive value of 96% and a negative&#xD;
      predictive value of 77% for VCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective study will look at a population of patients presenting to a large tertiary&#xD;
      care referral center for symptoms of cough. Currently patients seen at the &quot;Cough Clinic&quot; are&#xD;
      evaluated by a pulmonologist and an Otolaryngologist during their visit. Each patient&#xD;
      undergoes pulmonary function testing and VLS testing as part of the diagnostic workup. For&#xD;
      this study the history would be expanded to include the 4 specific symptoms described above&#xD;
      and scores tabulated and compared against the results of diagnostic testing. The findings of&#xD;
      this study will help providers understand the characteristics of patients with VCD and use&#xD;
      this information when deciding which patients should be referred for VLS testing.&#xD;

    <description>We will score each patient according to their symptoms of vocal cord dysfunction including; throat tightness (4 points), dysphonia (2 points), absence of wheezing (2 points), symptoms triggered by strong odors (3 points). A positive response will be assigned the score as indicated in parentheses behind each symptom. A negative response will be assigned zero points.</description>
