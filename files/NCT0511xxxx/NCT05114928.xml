  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Keratoconus is a progressive corneal disease characterized by asymmetric corneal thinning and&#xD;
      structural changes in corneal collagen which leads to decrease in visual acuity due to myopic&#xD;
      shift, irregular astigmatism or corneal scarring. Early detection of the disease in children&#xD;
      aids in halting the progression and improve their quality of life. There is no consensus&#xD;
      regarding the progression criteria of the disease, we aimed to assess the changes in corneal&#xD;
      asphericity in children after corneal collagen crosslinking and investigate any possible&#xD;
      correlation with progression criteria widely used.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Keratoconus progression is defined as increasing by 1.0 diopter (D) or more in the&#xD;
      maximum keratometry (Kmax), progressive deterioration in Minimal Corneal Thickness is also&#xD;
      associated with KC progression, other methods have been investigated to confirm KC&#xD;
      progression such as changes in manifest refraction, unaided visual acuity (UAVA), BCVA,&#xD;
      posterior keratometric data and higher order aberrations (HOA) which are altered in KC and&#xD;
      can aid to confirm disease progression. Q-value (a coefficient of corneal asphericity)&#xD;
      reflects the shape of the cornea, its refractive power, and spherical aberration. The mean&#xD;
      Q-value in normal cornea is -0.26 ± 0.18, the severity of KC and the Q-value are inversely&#xD;
      related.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mean Q-value in KC at 8mm zone is -0.84 and -1.10 for anterior and posterior corneal&#xD;
      surfaces, respectively. Until now, no precise criteria of KC progression especially in cases&#xD;
      had undergone previous trans-epithelial corneal collagen cross-linking (TE-CXL) to halt the&#xD;
      progression of the disease. In the present study we aimed to analyze the correlation between&#xD;
      the changes in Q-value and progression of the KC in children had undergone bilateral TE-CXL.&#xD;
