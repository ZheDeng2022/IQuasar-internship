  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate brain activity during current visual and auditory&#xD;
      tasks for balance control. The participants will perform cognitive, gait, and balance&#xD;
      measures before the data collection to exclude people with neurological disorders. The&#xD;
      participants will wear VR headset which provides visual tasks. The participants will need to&#xD;
      maintain balance while performing concurrent visual and auditory tasks. The brain activities,&#xD;
      reaction time, and eye-tracking data will be collected during doing our experimental tasks.&#xD;

      Virtual reality (VR), defined as an interactive system including computers and media&#xD;
      peripherals, creates an environment similar to a real-world and also provides audio and video&#xD;
      feedback to users. Recently, the virtual reality technology is able to make a headset&#xD;
      displaying 360 degrees VR environment and locate the headset in the space. This improvement&#xD;
      of VR technology significantly reduces the cost of VR equipment and enhances the application&#xD;
      of VR technology in the field of balance assessment and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optic flow (OF) has been used to study the effect of visual input on balance control. Most of&#xD;
      the studies displayed OF on a screen rather than using 360 degrees visual field environment.&#xD;
      Therefore, the subjects could obtain reference inputs for balance adjustment. The new VR&#xD;
      headset makes it possible to play OF in a 360-degree visual field in which the subject will&#xD;
      not able to obtain any reference inputs rather than using somatosensory and/or vestibular&#xD;
      systems. It is unclear how the effect of aging and attention relocation affects postural&#xD;
      control with concurrent visual and auditory attention tasks. In this study, fNIRS will be&#xD;
      used to detect the brain activity of healthy adults in the prefrontal and temporal-parietal&#xD;
      junction as they complete concurrent cognitive and visual tasks displayed by a VR headset.&#xD;
      This work will focus on age and test positions (sitting vs standing). As age can play a role&#xD;
      in brain activation levels, the investigators will compare results among younger adults&#xD;
      (25-35 years), older adults (65-85 years), and older adults with the risk of falls. All the&#xD;
      subjects will undergo concurrent auditory reaction time tasks and visual tracking tasks. The&#xD;
      investigators will compare the brain images from the test conditions between the age groups&#xD;
      and investigate if brain activity differs during the performance of reaction time tasks and&#xD;
      visual tacking tasks. The goal of this study is to examine the effect of concurrent visual&#xD;
      and auditory tasks on brain activation and postural control.&#xD;
