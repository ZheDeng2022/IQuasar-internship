  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and&#xD;
      preliminary antitumor activity of docetaxel for injection (albumin-bound) in different dose&#xD;
      regimens in patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted in two stages. The first stage (Stage I) is a dose-escalation&#xD;
      study. A classic 3+3 design will be used to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and&#xD;
      the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). Patients will receive the docetaxel for injection&#xD;
      (albumin-bound) until disease progression, or intolerable toxicity, or other reasons for&#xD;
      termination of the study. All dose-escalation decisions will be based on the safety data&#xD;
      generated from the current highest dose group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the cohort-expansion study (Stage Ⅱ), patients with a potential to have better response to&#xD;
      the study drug will be recruited. Patients will receive the docetaxel for injection&#xD;
      (albumin-bound) at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and follow the treatment regimen&#xD;
      established in Stage I.&#xD;
