  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to confirm the value of this new version of Pétale® ((small&#xD;
      equipment for testing the child's hearing) in the daily practice of general practitioners or&#xD;
      pediatricians for the screening of hearing disorders in very young children.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research procedure is auditory stimulation using Pétale® (small equipment for testing the&#xD;
      child's hearing) based on the &quot;orientation reflex&quot; (&quot;Ewing&quot; test): the child is seated on the&#xD;
      companion's knees between the two enclosures and the investigator observes whether or not he&#xD;
      is attracted to a familiar calibrated noise coming from one side or the other.&#xD;
