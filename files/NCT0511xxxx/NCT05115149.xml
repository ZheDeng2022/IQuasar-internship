      The aim of the study is to investigate the effectiveness of a new rehabilitation technology&#xD;
      for paralysis that occurs after stroke or spinal cord injury. The research will jointly use a&#xD;
      prototype neurorehabilitation orthosis, in which a robotic device moves a paralyzed arm at&#xD;
      the command of a non-invasive brain-computer interface to perform a game life-like task&#xD;
      augmented using a virtual-reality display, as well as an electrical stimulation device that&#xD;
      activates the spinal cord and/or muscles of the paralyzed arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators expect that a portion of the patients participating in the study will have an&#xD;
      improvement in arm mobility by the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who express their special written consent will have venous blood tests conducted&#xD;
      three times for subsequent analysis of lipid biomarkers, in order to further evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of rehabilitation methods based on biochemical analysis.&#xD;

      The aim of the study is to investigate the effectiveness of a new rehabilitation technology&#xD;
      for paralysis that occurs after stroke or spinal cord injury. The research will jointly use a&#xD;
      prototype neurorehabilitation orthosis, in which a robotic device moves a paralyzed arm at&#xD;
      the command of a non-invasive brain-computer interface to perform a game life-like task in&#xD;
      virtual reality (for example, aiming a hand-held virtual toy gun at a target), as well as an&#xD;
      electrical stimulation device that activates the spinal cord and/or muscles of the paralyzed&#xD;
      arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is carried out to collect data on the role of central and spinal mechanisms in the&#xD;
      plasticity of neuronal circuits that determine the effect of combined spinal neurostimulation&#xD;
      and robotic rehabilitation under the control of non-invasive neural interfaces in patients in&#xD;
      early and late rehabilitation period after acute cerebrovascular accident and in patients&#xD;
      after trauma of the cervical and upper thoracic spinal cord.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will use two technologies - neural interfaces and transcutaneous electrical&#xD;
      stimulation of the spinal cord. Neural interfaces are a rapidly developing area at the&#xD;
      intersection of medicine, neuroscience, biology, engineering, robotics, physics, mathematics,&#xD;
      and materials science, which aims to reproduce and supplement brain functions and correct&#xD;
      these functions in cases of neurological lesions. The possibility of using neural interfaces&#xD;
      for the treatment of neurological disorders, including disorders resulting from spinal cord&#xD;
      and brain injuries, epilepsy, strokes, and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease, has been demonstrated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (tSCS) is a method for non-invasive control of the&#xD;
      activity of human spinal neural networks used to restore locomotor functions after spinal&#xD;
      cord injury (SCI). The published research results show that tSCS modulates the activity of&#xD;
      not only spinal but also cortical neuronal networks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that the use of tSCS in conjunction with the use of neural interfaces will&#xD;
      increase the effectiveness of neural interfaces for the rehabilitation of neurological&#xD;
      lesions, including stroke, and SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biochemical monitoring will be applied for objective monitoring of the physiological&#xD;
      conditions of patients, such as the physiological state of muscle tissue and the level of&#xD;
      neuropathic pain. This method is based on the identification of metabolic and lipid compounds&#xD;
      associated with physiological parameters in blood plasma samples, and the subsequent use of&#xD;
      these compounds as biomarkers to assess the effectiveness of rehabilitation techniques&#xD;
      carried out using the neural interface, as well as to optimize them. This monitoring will be&#xD;
      helpful for each individual patient, as it will provide additional information about the&#xD;
      course of rehabilitation. Blood sampling and follow-up testing will only be performed for&#xD;
      patients who gave their written consent for this procedure. The analysis results will be&#xD;
      stored in anonymized form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study participants will receive up to 12 rehabilitation procedures, each lasting about&#xD;
      one hour, within two-four weeks. During the procedure, the activity of the brain&#xD;
      (electroencephalogram) and muscles (electromyogram) will be recorded using non- invasive&#xD;
      electrodes placed on the scalp and body. Also, during the study, electrical stimulation will&#xD;
      be performed with non-invasive electrodes placed on the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the exercise, participants focus their attention on the target of movement and/or&#xD;
      imagine that their arms perform a movement. If the task is completed correctly, the robot&#xD;
      will move the arm towards the target. This movement can additionally be accompanied with&#xD;
      functional electrical stimulation using disposable electrodes glued to the skin on the back&#xD;
      and/or the arms. The strength of the stimulation will be adjusted so as not to cause&#xD;
      discomfort. Participants will be randomly assigned to groups, and participants in some groups&#xD;
      will receive tSCS and some will not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of inclusion in the study, as part of Visit 1 (screening), anamnesis will be&#xD;
      collected, and there will be performed assessment on the study scales, BCI testing, an EMG&#xD;
      study with registration of muscle activity (rhomboid, pectoralis major, biceps, deltoid) and&#xD;
      / or visual determination of tSCS thresholds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After Visit 1, patients in the study groups will undergo 12 procedures of BCI-driven robotic&#xD;
      rehabilitation accompanied by tSCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 is carried out the next day after the end of the study to assess the study scales and&#xD;
      conduct the EMG study described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3 is carried out one month after the end of the study to assess the study scales and&#xD;
      conduct an EMG study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the study, adverse events (AEs) will be monitored. Sessions will be held daily in&#xD;
      6/1 or 5/2 mode, in a rehabilitation room or at patients' homes, with a session duration of&#xD;
      about 60 minutes. The duration of Visits 1-3 will be approximately 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators expect that a portion of the patients participating in the study will have an&#xD;
      improvement in voluntary arm movements by the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient data will be recorded and stored in anonymized form. Only research team members will&#xD;
      have access to this information. If it is necessary to publish individual results on study&#xD;
      scales, diagnoses, anamnesis, and age of participants, participants will be identified with&#xD;
      codes. The study data is supposed to be stored for 10 years on a protected file storage with&#xD;
      limited access.&#xD;
