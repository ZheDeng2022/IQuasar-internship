  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients in rehabilitation may undergo periods of prolonged limb immobilization in response&#xD;
      to injury, surgery, or illness. Due to disuse, the size and strength of muscles controlling&#xD;
      the affected limb can decrease significantly, possibly resulting in physical impairment or&#xD;
      lower quality of life during the recovery phase. Prior immobilization studies have shown that&#xD;
      the rate and degree of decline in muscle strength exceeds that of muscle size, indicating&#xD;
      that determinants of muscle strength unrelated to muscle size may further contribute to&#xD;
      functional changes during immobilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to describe the changes in muscle strength, muscle size,&#xD;
      corticospinal excitability, voluntary activation, M1 cortical thickness, and resting state&#xD;
      functional connectivity following a 2-week limb immobilization period in young women.&#xD;
