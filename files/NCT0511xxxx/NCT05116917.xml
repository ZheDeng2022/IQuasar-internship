  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer (PC) remains a dreadful disease due to its often advanced stage at&#xD;
      diagnosis and poor sensitivity to chemotherapy. Progression after 1. line chemotherapy is&#xD;
      inevitable in patients with advanced PC, and treatment options for patients who progress&#xD;
      after 1. line chemotherapy are limited. Considering the emerging role of the tumor&#xD;
      microenvironment, the combination of checkpoint blocking antibodies with immunomodulation of&#xD;
      the tumor microenvironment could lead to better responses in tumor historically resistant to&#xD;
      radiation and checkpoint blocking antibody approaches as single modalities. Influenza&#xD;
      vaccination in cancer patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors resulted in a better&#xD;
      survival, irrespective of the anticancer treatment outcome. Influenza vaccine facilitates&#xD;
      both T- and B cell activation and drives interferon-gamma response, supporting the rationale&#xD;
      for combining of influenza vaccine with immune checkpoint inhibition and radiation&#xD;
      (NCT02866383).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these considerations, the proposed treatment with SBRT of 15 Gy in combination with&#xD;
      nivolumab, ipilimumab and influenza vaccine may have the potential to provide meaningful&#xD;
      clinical benefit by generating durable clinical responses, thereby improving quality of life&#xD;
      (QoL) and potentially extending survival.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer (PC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer death, and each year 1000 Danes&#xD;
      are diagnosed with PC, 80% of which are advanced stage. Survival rates are meager, currently&#xD;
      approaching 10% at 5 years postdiagnosis, and have scarcely improved over the last 50 years.&#xD;
      PC is highly resistant to conventional treatments, and nearly all patients develop metastases&#xD;
      and die. As the incidence of PC continuously rises while treatment response rates remain&#xD;
      incredibly low, a lack of effective therapy options and accurate predictive biomarkers is a&#xD;
      real cause for concern and underlines the need for further research in this area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunotherapy has not been successful in PC patients primarily due to a lack of pre-existing&#xD;
      T-cell immunity and/or a highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment.&#xD;
      &quot;Non-immunogenicity&quot; of PC with high prevalence of immunosuppressive cells and typically a&#xD;
      scarcity of tumor-infiltrating effector lymphocytes is considered as one of the reasons for&#xD;
      lacking responsiveness to single-agent immunotherapies. Considering the emerging role of the&#xD;
      tumor microenvironment, the combination of checkpoint blocking antibodies with&#xD;
      immunomodulation of the tumor microenvironment could lead to better responses in tumor&#xD;
      historically resistant to radiation and checkpoint blocking antibody approaches as single&#xD;
      modalities. Preliminary data from the phase 2 study CHECKPAC (NCT02866383) showed durable&#xD;
      clinical benefit in a small subgroup of patients after the addition of stereotactic body&#xD;
      radiation therapy (SBRT) of 15 Gy to the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab (Herlev&#xD;
      internal data) in patients with resistant metastatic PC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Influenza vaccination in cancer patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors inexplicably&#xD;
      was associated with a better survival, irrespective of the anticancer treatment outcome.&#xD;
      Influenza vaccine facilitates both T- and B cell activation and drives interferon-gamma&#xD;
      response, supporting the rationale for combining of influenza vaccine with CHECKPAC strategy.&#xD;
      Based on these considerations, the proposed treatment with nivolumab, ipilimumab and&#xD;
      radiation in combination with influenza vaccine may potentially provide meaningful clinical&#xD;
      benefit by generating durable clinical responses, thereby improving quality of life (QoL) and&#xD;
      potentially extending survival.&#xD;

               -  Subjects must have signed and dated an IRB/IEC approved written informed consent&#xD;
                  form in accordance with regulatory and institutional guidelines. This must be&#xD;
                  obtained before the performance of any protocol related procedures that are not&#xD;
                  part of normal subject care&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects must be willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment&#xD;
                  schedule, laboratory testing, and other requirements of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histological or cytological confirmation of advanced pancreatic carcinoma prior to&#xD;
             entering this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior therapy requirements:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  There is no upper limit on the number of prior chemotherapy regimens received.&#xD;
                  Participants must have received and progressed during or after at least 1 line of&#xD;
                  systemic chemotherapy in the metastatic setting (gemcitabine or 5-FU based&#xD;
                  regimens).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Notes:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  If a participant received adjuvant/neoadjuvant systemic combinational&#xD;
                       therapy, and progressed within 6 months, the adjuvant/neoadjuvant treatment&#xD;
                       will be considered as 1 line of systemic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  In general, discontinuation of 1 drug in a multi-drug regimen and&#xD;
                       continuation of other drug(s), is considered part of the same line of&#xD;
                       treatment. Restarting the same regimen after a drug holiday or maintenance&#xD;
                       chemotherapy can also be considered part of the same line of treatment.&#xD;
                       Switching from IV (5-FU) to an oral formulation (capecitabine) of the same&#xD;
                       drug is also considered part of the same line of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Minimum time from first systemic therapy for recurrent/metastatic&#xD;
                       adenocarcinoma of pancreas to progression should be at least 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18 years and older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG/WHO Performance Status (PS) 0-1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All participants will be required to undergo mandatory pre- and on-treatment biopsies&#xD;
             at acceptable clinical risk as judged by the investigator. An archival pre-treatment&#xD;
             sample is not acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 10⁹/L&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelet count ≥ 75 x 10⁹/L&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST/ALT ≤ 5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN or CrCl ≥ 40 mL/min (using the Cockcroft-Gault&#xD;
                  formula)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must use method(s) of contraception as&#xD;
             indicated in Appendix 3. For a teratogenic study drug and/or when there is&#xD;
             insufficient information to assess teratogenicity (preclinical studies have not been&#xD;
             done), a highly effective method(s) of contraception (failure rate of less than 1% per&#xD;
             year) is required. The individual methods of contraception and duration should be&#xD;
             determined in consultation with the investigator. WOCBP must follow instructions for&#xD;
             birth control when the half-life of the investigational drug is greater than 24 hours,&#xD;
             contraception should be continued for a period of 30 days plus the time required for&#xD;
             the investigational drug to undergo five half-lives. The half-life of nivolumab and&#xD;
             ipilimumab is up to 25 days and 18 days, respectively. WOCBP should therefore use an&#xD;
             adequate method to avoid pregnancy for 23 weeks (30 days plus the time required for&#xD;
             nivolumab to undergo five half-lives) after the last dose of investigational drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must use any contraceptive method with a&#xD;
             failure rate of less than 1% per year. The investigator shall review contraception&#xD;
             methods and the time period that contraception must be followed. Men that are sexually&#xD;
             active with WOCBP must follow instructions for birth control when the half-life of the&#xD;
             investigational drug is greater than 24 hours, contraception should be continued for a&#xD;
             period of 90 days plus the time required for the investigational drug to undergo five&#xD;
             half-lives. The half-life of nivolumab is up to 25 days. Men who are sexually active&#xD;
             with WOCBP must continue contraception for 31 weeks (90 days plus the time required&#xD;
             for nivolumab to undergo five half-lives) after the last dose of investigational drug.&#xD;
             Women who are not of childbearing potential (i.e. who are postmenopausal or surgically&#xD;
             sterile as well as azoospermic men do not require contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have signed and dated a BIOPAC approved written informed consent form in&#xD;
             accordance with regulatory and institutional guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any serious or uncontrolled medical disorder that, in the opinion of the investigator,&#xD;
             may increase the risk associated with study participation or study drug&#xD;
             administration, impair the ability of the subject to receive protocol therapy, or&#xD;
             interfere with the interpretation of study results&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with active, known or suspected autoimmune disease. Participants with&#xD;
             vitiligo, type I diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune&#xD;
             condition only requiring hormone replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic&#xD;
             treatment, or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger&#xD;
             are permitted to enroll&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 14 days before the first&#xD;
             dose of nivolumab, ipilimumab and radiation in combination with influenza vaccine. The&#xD;
             following are exceptions to this criterion:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Intranasal, inhaled, or topical steroids; or local steroid injections (e.g.&#xD;
                  intra-articular injection)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Systemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses not to exceed 10 mg/day of&#xD;
                  prednisone or equivalent&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity reactions (e.g. CT scan&#xD;
                  premedication)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants should be excluded if they have known history of testing positive for&#xD;
             human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Allergies and Adverse Drug Reaction&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History of allergy to study drug components&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History of severe hypersensitivity reaction to any monoclonal antibody&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Already received the influenza vaccine for the current season of inclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  WOCBP who are pregnant or breastfeeding&#xD;
