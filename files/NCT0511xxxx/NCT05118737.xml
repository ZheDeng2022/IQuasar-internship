      Colchicine acts upstream in the cytokines cascade by inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome while&#xD;
      IL-6 receptor antagonists (tocilizumab) block the end result of the cytokines cascade. Hence,&#xD;
      adding colchicine to tocilizumab with the aim of blocking the early and end products of the&#xD;
      cytokines cascade, might reduce the risk of developing cytokine storm and hence the need for&#xD;
      invasive mechanical ventilation and eventually death. Therefore, we aim to conduct an&#xD;
      open-label randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adding&#xD;
      colchicine to tocilizumab among patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia in an attempt to&#xD;
      reduce the rate of invasive mechanical ventilation and mortality. We will include patients&#xD;
      with severe COVID-19 pneumonia and already received tocilizumab according to local protocol.&#xD;
      Enrolled patient will be then randomized in 1:1 to colchicine versus no colchicine. Patients&#xD;
      will be followed up until discharge or for 30 days, whichever comes first. Data will be&#xD;
      collected from electronic medical profiles. The primary efficacy outcome will be rate of&#xD;
      invasive mechanical ventilation and will be determined using Cox proportional hazard model.&#xD;

      The novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) significantly contributes to increased mortality&#xD;
      in many countries, with a continuously increasing number of infected cases worldwide.1 As of&#xD;
      the end of February 2021, there have been over 112 million confirmed cases of COVID-19,&#xD;
      including 2.5 million deaths globally.2 The leading cause of mortality due to COVID-19 is&#xD;
      respiratory failure from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).3 The mechanisms by which&#xD;
      COVID-19 induces ARDS is currently thought to be due to the activation of the innate immune&#xD;
      system leading to hypercytokinemia and hence cytokine storm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19 disease course can be divided into three phases; (1) early infection phase, where&#xD;
      the virus penetrates host cells in the lung parenchyma; (2) pulmonary phase, in which the&#xD;
      viral propagation causes lung tissue injury and hence the host immune response is activated;&#xD;
      and (3) the inflammatory cascade, which is triggered by the viral RNA and it is comprised of&#xD;
      inflammasome activation that drives the cytokine storm.4,5 SARS-CoV-2 acts on the macrophages&#xD;
      to release the nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, leading to the conversion of&#xD;
      pro-interleukin (IL)-1 and pro-IL-18 to their active forms.6,7 The production of IL-1 leads&#xD;
      to IL-6 synthesis which is a cytokine that induces C reactive protein (CRP) and has been&#xD;
      considered a major proinflammatory agent in the COVID-19 cytokine storm.8-11 Consequently, a&#xD;
      few biological therapies that have been studied and used for the treatment of COVID-19 to&#xD;
      target specific cytokines augmented by the disease, including anakinra for IL-1, and&#xD;
      tocilizumab for IL-6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, the therapeutic efficacy of IL-6 antagonists was evaluated.&#xD;
      So far, the results of the evidence assessing the use of IL-6 antagonists are somewhat&#xD;
      controversial. A meta-analysis of seven retrospective observational studies using tocilizumab&#xD;
      in patients with severe COVID-19 found that tocilizumab resulted in lower all-cause mortality&#xD;
      compared to placebo without achieving statistical significance. Furthermore, the risk of ICU&#xD;
      admission and the need for mechanical ventilation were similar between the two groups.&#xD;
      Recently, the REMAP-CAP trial evaluated the use of a single injection of an IL-6 receptor&#xD;
      blocker, tocilizumab or sarilumab, compared to placebo among 800 patients in need of&#xD;
      respiratory or blood-pressure support or both. It showed that IL-6 antagonist resulted in an&#xD;
      in-hospital mortality of 27%, as compared with 36% in the control group. On the contrary, the&#xD;
      COVACTA trial evaluated the use of tocilizumab versus placebo among 452 patients with severe&#xD;
      COVID-19 pneumonia and it showed that the mortality rate was 19.7% in the tocilizumab group&#xD;
      versus 19.4% in the control group. Therefore, in the absence of potent antiviral therapies to&#xD;
      block SARS-CoV-2 replication, it remains unclear whether blocking IL-6 alone is effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colchicine is one of the oldest anti-inflammatory therapies that is approved for treating and&#xD;
      preventing acute gout attacks and familial Mediterranean fever. Colchicine has been shown to&#xD;
      interfere with the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, reducing IL-1 production, which in&#xD;
      turn prevents IL-6 release and neutrophils and macrophages activation. Consequently,&#xD;
      colchicine targets multiple cytokines in the inflammatory cascade of the cytokine storm&#xD;
      induced by COVID-19, which makes it a potential anti-inflammatory therapy for COVID-19.&#xD;
      Colchicine differs from IL-6 receptor blockers by having pleotropic mechanisms of action,&#xD;
      acting upstream of the cascade of cytokines, and being an oral agent. A few studies have&#xD;
      evaluated the use of colchicine in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The GRECO-19 trial&#xD;
      was the first open-label randomized trial that evaluated the efficacy of colchicine versus&#xD;
      usual care in non-critically ill hospitalized patients. The study included 105 patients and&#xD;
      found a significant reduction in the primary outcome of a two-point deterioration on World&#xD;
      Health Organization disease severity scale. Additionally, in a single center cohort study in&#xD;
      Italy, the use of colchicine in 122 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 compared with 140&#xD;
      patients who received hydroxychloroquine and/or intravenous dexamethasone; and/or&#xD;
      lopinavir/ritonavir, resulted in a significantly better survival rate at 21 days (84.2%&#xD;
      versus 63.6% respectively, p=0.001).22 Moreover, there are a few ongoing trials in different&#xD;
      countries evaluating the use of colchicine in COVID-19 in comparison to standard care, while&#xD;
      excluding the concurrent use of IL-6 antagonists: Given its ease of use, low cost, good&#xD;
      safety profile, having different anti-inflammatory mechanism of action than other IL-6&#xD;
      blockade, and the lack of an effective therapy for COVID-19 so far, colchicine might serve as&#xD;
      a potential anti-inflammatory agent among patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Colchicine&#xD;
      acts upstream in the cytokines cascade by inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome while IL-6&#xD;
      receptor antagonists block the end result of the cytokines cascade. The latter might be the&#xD;
      reason behind the controversies surrounding tocilizumab efficacy in treating COVID-19 as it&#xD;
      has been thought that the ongoing replication of the virus overwhelms the drug capacity to&#xD;
      control the disease burden. Given the lack of potent anti-viral agents against SARS-CoV-2,&#xD;
      adding colchicine to tocilizumab with the aim of blocking the early and end products of the&#xD;
      cytokines cascade, might reduce the risk of developing cytokine storm and hence the need for&#xD;
      invasive mechanical ventilation and eventually death. Therefore, we aim to conduct an&#xD;
      open-label randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adding&#xD;
      colchicine to tocilizumab among patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia in an attempt to&#xD;
      reduce the rate of invasive mechanical ventilation and mortality.&#xD;
