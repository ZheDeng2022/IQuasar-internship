  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to use a pre-test post-test research design to investigate whether dry&#xD;
      needling (DN) has an effect on cortical excitability in patients with chronic low back pain&#xD;
      (CLBP), specifically in patients who have developed central sensitization (CS). Therefore,&#xD;
      the primary purpose of this study is to examine the immediate effects of a single session of&#xD;
      DN on cortical excitability and neurosensory responses in patients CLBP. There are two&#xD;
      specific aims: 1) to examine whether a single session of DN will change cortical excitability&#xD;
      corresponding to the lumbar multifidus (LM) muscle, and 2) to examine whether a single&#xD;
      session of DN will change neurosensory responses to the stimuli applied to the LM muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators also are interested in exploring whether DN has a differential effect on&#xD;
      cortical excitability in patients with CLBP who have developed CS vs. those who have not&#xD;
      developed CS. Therefore, the secondary purpose of the study is to compare the immediate&#xD;
      effects of a single session of DN on cortical excitability between patients with CLBP who&#xD;
      have developed central sensitization (CS) and those who do not have CS. The specific aim is&#xD;
      to compare cortical excitability corresponding to the LM in participants with and without CS&#xD;
      after a single session of DN.&#xD;

      Research Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be pre-test post-test trial, in which all eligible participants will receive&#xD;
      a single session of dry needling (DN). All outcome measures will be collected before and&#xD;
      immediately after a single session of DN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be asked to complete an intake form, asking them about their&#xD;
      demographic data, including age, gender, height, weight, occupation, past medical history,&#xD;
      and questions related to their low back pain (onset, injury mechanism if any, location,&#xD;
      duration, type, and nature). Once the participant's eligibility is confirmed, each&#xD;
      participant will complete the Central Sensitization Inventory (CSI) questionnaire to assign&#xD;
      each participant either in the CS group or non-CS group using the 40 cutoff score of the CSI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinical Assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Each participant will complete 3 self-reported questionnaires before cortical&#xD;
           excitability assessment, including pain intensity determined using the Numeric Pain&#xD;
           Rating Scale (NPRS), disability determined using the Modified Oswestry Low Back Pain&#xD;
           Disability Questionnaire (modified ODI), and quality of life determined by the&#xD;
           Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System® -short form (PROMIS-29). These&#xD;
           questionnaires will be used to describe the characteristics of the participants in this&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cortical Excitability Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Three cortical excitability parameters will be collected: amplitudes of motor evoked&#xD;
           potentials (MEPs), intracortical facilitation (ICF) values, and short-interval cortical&#xD;
           inhibition (SICI) values. Participants will lie in a prone position for the&#xD;
           electromyographic (EMG) setup. EMG activity will be collected from the painful side of&#xD;
           the L4-5 area. Following the recommendations of the Surface ElectroMyoGraphy for the&#xD;
           Non-Invasive Assessment of Muscles (SENIAM) project, the electrode for the LM will be&#xD;
           placed at the L4-5 level, approximately 2-3 cm from the midline, and will be aligned&#xD;
           with a line from the posterior superior iliac spine (PSIS) to the interspace between the&#xD;
           L1 and L2 spinous process.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To obtain MEPs of the LM muscle, the M1 (primary motor cortex) will be stimulated while&#xD;
           the participant performs a submaximal voluntary contraction. First, the maximum&#xD;
           voluntary isometric contractions (MVIC) of the LM will be determined. During the MVIC&#xD;
           testing, each participant will perform the maximum upper extremity and trunk lift with&#xD;
           the elbows flexed to approximately 90° and shoulders abducted to approximately 120°, and&#xD;
           maintain the lift for 3 seconds while resisting against a load applied at the opposite&#xD;
           elbow of the painful side by the testing investigator. Two trials each will be performed&#xD;
           and the highest root mean square (RMS) of EMG amplitude will be identified. During the&#xD;
           cortical excitability assessment, a target line representing ~ 20% of highest RMS value&#xD;
           during MVIC will be placed on the real-time EMG monitor while the participant will be&#xD;
           asked to maintain the target LM activation by slightly leaning forward and to maintain&#xD;
           lumbar lordosis in a seated position.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Following the MVIC testing, each participant will be seated on a chair for cortical&#xD;
           excitability assessment. A &quot;hot spot&quot; will be determined while the participant maintains&#xD;
           a 20% submaximal contraction of the LM (i.e., slightly leaning forward and maintain&#xD;
           lumbar lordosis). A hot spot is defined as the site at which the largest MEP amplitude&#xD;
           is obtained at the lowest TMS stimulation intensity or output (0-100%). The double-cone&#xD;
           coil will be positioned over the M1 area opposite to the participant's most painful&#xD;
           side. The intensity of TMS stimulation from one TMS stimulator will begin at 35% of&#xD;
           stimulator output and then will be increased gradually to yield a MEP from the LM until&#xD;
           a 'hot spot' is observed. Next, the active motor threshold (AMT) will be determined. AMT&#xD;
           is defined as the stimulation intensity which yields a peak-to-peak amplitude of MEP&#xD;
           larger than 200 μV in 5 out of 10 consecutive trials. Once the AMT is determined, the&#xD;
           stimulation intensity will be set at 130% of AMT and 10 stimulations will be delivered&#xD;
           to the hot spot. The 10 supra-threshold MEP amplitudes (uV) recorded from the LM will be&#xD;
           averaged and the average will be used for statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For the ICF and SICI testing, two stimuli, one conditioning stimulus and one test&#xD;
           stimulus, will be generated from two TMS stimulators connected by a coil (BiStim Module,&#xD;
           Magstim Co., UK). In ICF, a subthreshold conditioning (second) TMS at the 90% AMT will&#xD;
           be delivered to the hot spot 15 ms after a test (first) TMS at the 100% AMT. In SICI, a&#xD;
           subthreshold conditioning TMS at 70% AMT will be delivered 2 ms before a test TMS at a&#xD;
           supra-threshold test TMS at 120% AMT. For both ICF and SICI, the amplitude of the&#xD;
           conditioned MEP will be expressed relative to the amplitude of the corresponding test&#xD;
           MEP. Ten trials will be performed for each of the ICF and SICI tests, and the average of&#xD;
           the 10 trials will be used for statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Quantitative Sensory Tests (QSTs):&#xD;
&#xD;
           The two QSTs, pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) and conditioned pain modulation (CPM)&#xD;
           tests, will be administered after the cortical excitability assessments both before and&#xD;
           after the DN intervention. During the PPT, participants will be given a response button&#xD;
           to stop testing on their own, and will be instructed to stop the test as soon as the&#xD;
           pressure becomes uncomfortable or painful, and not to allow an uncomfortable or painful&#xD;
           sensation to continue. Four trials will be tested on the most tender point around L4-5,&#xD;
           but the first trial will be counted as a practice trial. The average of the last three&#xD;
           trials will be used for statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For the CPM test, a thermode will be applied to the most tender point of the low back&#xD;
           and then heat temperature will increase at 1°/sec to the point until the participant&#xD;
           perceives the heat stimuli painful at 6/10 on the numeric pain rating scale (NPRS). Two&#xD;
           thermodes which generate heat stimuli at the temperature that the participant rates 6/10&#xD;
           on the NPRS will be used for the CPM testing, one applied to the most tender point of&#xD;
           the low back (test stimulus), and the other on the contralateral side of forearm&#xD;
           (conditioning stimulus). The NPRS scores will be collected under the two conditions:&#xD;
           test stimuli alone and combined test stimuli and conditioning stimuli. The test stimuli&#xD;
           will be applied first for 10 seconds and then the conditioning stimuli for 25 seconds,&#xD;
           so that the second application of the testing stimuli (for 10 seconds) would occur after&#xD;
           15 seconds of conditioning stimuli.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Dry Needling Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Two lengths of sterile, disposable, 0.30 mm x 60 mm solid filament needles (Seirin&#xD;
           Corp., Shizuoka, Japan) and 0.30 mm x 100 mm solid filament needles (Shanghai Kangnian&#xD;
           Medical Device Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) will be used in the study. The length of the&#xD;
           needle for each participant will be selected based on the size of the participant. Two&#xD;
           needles will be inserted on or near the most tender point of the low back. Two&#xD;
           additional needles will be inserted on the opposite side at the level of the most tender&#xD;
           point regardless of unilateral or bilateral LBP. After piercing the skin, the needle&#xD;
           will be directed toward the spinous process in a slight inferior-medial angle&#xD;
           (approximately 20-30°). Once the needle is inserted, the treating investigator will use&#xD;
           ultrasound (US) scanner to visualize the needle placement and to confirm that needle has&#xD;
           reached the deeper layer of the LM. Once the needle placement is confirmed, it will be&#xD;
           pulled slightly in and out within the muscle and redirected in small angles for 10&#xD;
           seconds after insertion. The needles will stay (in situ) in the LM for approximately 10&#xD;
           minutes after the insertion and then will be withdrawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be calculated for participant characteristics as well as baseline&#xD;
      outcome measures (amplitudes of MEPs, ICF values, SICI values, PPTs, and CPM scores) of all&#xD;
      participants. Independent t-tests will be used to compare the ratio data of participant&#xD;
      characteristics, self-reported questionnaires, and baseline outcome measures between the two&#xD;
      groups. Chi-square statistics will be used to analyze categorical data of participant&#xD;
      characteristics (e.g., sex, side(s) of pain, testing side).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical analysis used to address the three aims with the alpha level is set at 0.05&#xD;
      for all statistical analyses: 1) three paired-t tests or Wilcoxon signed rank tests for the&#xD;
      three cortical excitability variables (amplitudes of MEPs, ICF values, and SICI values),&#xD;
      respectively, 2) two paired-t tests or Wilcoxon signed rank tests for the two neurosensory&#xD;
      variables (PPT and CPM values), respectively, and 3) three 2 (group) x 2 (time) repeated&#xD;
      measure ANOVAs to compare CS and non-CS group for the 3 cortical excitability variables,&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
