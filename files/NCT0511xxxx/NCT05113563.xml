  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our goal in this study is to investigate TEST (Transcranial Electric Stimulation Therapy) for&#xD;
      chronic pain. TEST is similar to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in that an electrical&#xD;
      stimulus is delivered to the brain. However, the dose of stimulation used for TEST is lower&#xD;
      than ECT, and we expect that a seizure will not be generated with TEST (although general&#xD;
      anesthesia is required). A previous publication has shown that TEST is effective for&#xD;
      treatment resistant depression, without effects on memory that can accompany ECT.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We propose to investigate the feasibility of TEST in subjects with chronic pain. This will be&#xD;
      an open-label study where subjects (n=12) are administered 8-10 sessions of TEST over 4&#xD;
      weeks. Measurements of pain, mood, and memory will be obtained before and after the sessions.&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that TEST will be feasible and tolerable in this population.&#xD;
