  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study was designed leg resistance training combined with breathing&#xD;
      approach, and evaluated its effect on wound healing, blood sugar control and quality of life&#xD;
      in type 2 diabetic patients with foot ulcers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled trial was used. type 2 diabetic patients who suffered from foot&#xD;
      ulcers were recruited from one medical center of Northern Taiwan, and randomly assigned into&#xD;
      the exercise or control group. The control group received usual care for diabetic foot. The&#xD;
      exercise group received usual care and breathing-based leg resistance exercise program for 12&#xD;
      weeks. Outcomes were measured by wound healing area, the fasting of blood glucose, hemoglobin&#xD;
      A1c (HbA1c), and the World Health Organization quality of life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF) before the&#xD;
      intervention as baseline, and the 4th, 8th and 12th weeks during the intervention period.&#xD;
