    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to describe the patient clinical profile, resource requirements, and&#xD;
      health system dynamics in a field hospital during the second wave of the Coronavirus&#xD;
      (COVID-19) pandemic, leading to the outbreak of viral severe acute respiratory syndrome&#xD;
      (SARS-CoV-2 virus), in South Africa. By describing the field hospital in this unique setting,&#xD;
      the investigators hope to provide an efficient guide to similar settings across low- and&#xD;
      middle-income countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was a retrospective, single-center study. A total of 596 patients with confirmed&#xD;
      COVID-19 were admitted to Mitchells Plain Hospital of Hope (MPHOH), Cape Town, South Africa,&#xD;
      between January 1st and February 28th, 2021. Patient clinical characteristics, outcome, and&#xD;
      resource allocation was collected. Daily hospital dynamics, including admissions, discharges,&#xD;
      deaths and oxygen use was analyzed and compared to the local and national COVID-19 incidence&#xD;
      rates.&#xD;

      The aim of the study is to amplify what is known about field hospitals in&#xD;
      resource-constrained setting, so as to guide meaningfully the future COVID-19 public health&#xD;
      response. Understanding not only the patient profile, but clinical resource requirements, and&#xD;
      health system dynamic in a South African field hospital during the second wave of the&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic can help in preparation for a future infection surge. This will shed light&#xD;
      on the extent and timing of excess demand for intermediate care facilities for COVID-19&#xD;
      during peak infection periods in this region. Furthermore, lessons learnt here can guide&#xD;
      efforts in similar settings across low-and middle-income countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data was collected on all patients admitted to MPHOH between January 1st and February 28th&#xD;
      2021 using notes from patient folders' and an electronic hospital records systems. Patient&#xD;
      demographics, clinical profile, resource utilization; as well as the hospital dynamics were&#xD;
      collected. COVID-19 incidence rates were collected from the National Institute for Infectious&#xD;
      Diseases, South Africa&#xD;
&#xD;
      A descriptive data analysis was performed to report the number, mean, median, and range of&#xD;
      all relevant values. Hospital level data were summarized into weekly intervals, described and&#xD;
      compared to COVID-19 incidence rates. Statistical data analysis was performed using R&#xD;
      Statistical Computing program and Microsoft Excel.&#xD;
