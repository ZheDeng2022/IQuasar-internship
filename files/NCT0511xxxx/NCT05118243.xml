  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of enzymatic treatment to reduce GOS&#xD;
      (galactooligosaccharides) in legume-based crackers in IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) persons.&#xD;
      The crackers are pea-based: the control crackers contain high amounts of GOS, while the&#xD;
      enzymatically treated crackers contain a minimal amount of GOS. The participants will eat&#xD;
      each type of cracker for three days (daily dose of 12 crackers) and report their gut symptoms&#xD;
      (e.g. flatulence, stomach pain, bloating) by using a mobile app. There is a washout period of&#xD;
      four days between the different crackers. In addition, the participants will keep food&#xD;
      records on the cracker eating days as well as collect five fecal samples during the study.&#xD;
      The participants will also report their physical activity and the number of defecations on&#xD;
      each day. The study is carried out in a double-blinded crossover setting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A human intervention study with volunteers suffering from either irritable bowel syndrome&#xD;
      (IBS) or functional bloating (FB) will be carried out to investigate the effects of enzymatic&#xD;
      treatment of pea-based product on gastrointestinal symptoms and gut microbiota composition as&#xD;
      well as hydrogen production due to carbohydrate fermentation. Enzyme-treated product will be&#xD;
      compared to a control product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to investigate, whether enzyme-treated cracker, compared to a control&#xD;
      product, will reduce gastrointestinaI symptoms, or have an impact on fecal microbiome or&#xD;
      carbohydrate fermentation measured by breath hydrogen concentration. The effects of eating&#xD;
      enzyme-treated crackers on food intake, exercise and stool frequency will also be&#xD;
      investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is carried out in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled crossover&#xD;
      design. The study includes two 1-week treatment periods with 1-week run-in period before the&#xD;
      intervention. Participants (N=35 at the maximum) are adult males and females who meet Rome IV&#xD;
      criteria for IBS or FB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria will be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  coeliac disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  inflammatory bowel disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  pregnancy or breastfeeding&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  antibiotics within the last 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  colonoscopy and preparations for it within 4 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      During both treatment weeks each participant will receive three-day portion of either&#xD;
      Î±-galactosidase-treated or control pea-based crackers. The participants will be advised to&#xD;
      avoid foods that trigger their gastrointestinaI symptoms and otherwise follow their habitual&#xD;
      diets for the whole 3-week study period. They will be asked to report severity of nine&#xD;
      gastrointestinaI symptoms, keep food record, collect fecal samples, measure breath hydrogen&#xD;
      and report their physical activity as well as stool frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will report their gastrointestinal symptoms throughout the study weeks&#xD;
      (twice a day on cracker eating days, once on washout days). Physical activity and stool&#xD;
      frequency will also be reported daily. Fecal samples will be collected during the run-in&#xD;
      period (at baseline) and on third and seventh day of each treatment week. Breath hydrogen&#xD;
      will be measured on second day of both treatment weeks. Nutrient intake and food consumption&#xD;
      will be analyzed from 3-day food records during the run-in week and each treatment week&#xD;
      (total 9 days). Nutrient intake will be calculated using a new Finnish 'Aromi Diet' software.&#xD;
