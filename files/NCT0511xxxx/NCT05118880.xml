  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research was conducted in experimental design with intervention-control group and&#xD;
      pretest-posttest in order to examine the effectiveness of the Peer Bullying Consultancy&#xD;
      Program (PBCP), is based on the Interpersonal Relations Model (IPM), on 11-12 years old&#xD;
      children who are bullying. The sample group of the study consisted of children (intervention&#xD;
      group/n=29; control group/n=32) were attending 5th and 6th grades in two different randomized&#xD;
      designated secondary schools after stratified sampling, had high Peer Bullying Determination&#xD;
      Scale Bully Behavior. The PBCP was implemented to the children in the intervention group in 2&#xD;
      face-to-face and 5 online individual interviews in 26 days. To increase the peer bullying&#xD;
      cognition level, to develop empathy skills, to improve friendship relations, to increase&#xD;
      anger control of children who are bullying in intervention group, content suitable for age&#xD;
      characteristics was developed within the scope of PBCP various training techniques&#xD;
      (brainstorming, educational game, demonstration, case study, video watching) used. The data&#xD;
      were collected using Sociodemographic Information Form, the Bullying Related Cognitions Scale&#xD;
      for Children (BRCSC), the Empathy Scale for Children and Adolescents (ESCA), Friendship&#xD;
      Relations and Anger Control Assessment Form. Data collection tools were applied to the&#xD;
      children in the intervention group at the beginning and at the end of the PBCP, and to the&#xD;
      children in the control group with an interval of 26 days. In the study, children in the&#xD;
      intervention group had lower scores on the BRCSC; had higher scores on the ESCA,&#xD;
      Self-Reporting Happiness Level in Friendship Relations, Sample Behavior Knowledge Level for&#xD;
      Happy Friendship, Understanding Level of Anger Symtoms, Knowledge Level of Anger Control and&#xD;
      Self-Reporting Anger Control Level than the children in the control group (p&lt;0.05). It has&#xD;
      been determined the PBCP based on the IRM is effective for children aged 11-12 who are&#xD;
      bullying. It is recommended nurses develop model-based, individual counseling and training&#xD;
      program in which different educational techniques are used in accordance with the age&#xD;
      characteristics in order to support the growth, development of children who are bullying&#xD;
      within the framework of their roles such as advocate, consultant, leader.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Bullying Cognitions Scale for Children mean scores (BCSC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-test and post-test</time_frame>
    <description>The BCSC was developed to assess the cognitive characteristics associated with peer bullying in children. The twenty-two-item scale was graded in a 4-point likert type ('completely true', 'quite true', 'somewhat true', 'not true at all'). The 'completely correct' response was rated as 4 points, the 'quite correct' response as 3 points, the 'somewhat correct' response as 2 points, and the 'not at all correct' response as 1 point. There is no reverse item in the scale. The scale is evaluated with a total score. The highest total score that can be obtained from the scale is &quot;88&quot; and the lowest score is &quot;22&quot;. The higher the scores, the higher the cognitions about bullying. In other words, bullying is considered normal and normal.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Empathy Scale for Children and Adolescents (ESCA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-test and post-test</time_frame>
    <description>The scale consists of 21 items. The scale is filled by giving one of the two answers as 'Yes' or 'No' to its items. The 'Yes' response was scored as 1 point, and the 'No' response as 0 points. However, some items (2,8,9,14,15,16,17,19,20 and 21) in the scale are reverse scored. In this case, 1 point was given to the &quot;no&quot; answer given to the item in question, and 0 point was given to the &quot;yes&quot; answer. The lowest score that can be obtained from the scale is 0, and the highest score is 21. As the score obtained from the scale increases, the empathic tendency increases, and as the score decreases, the empathic tendency decreases. The internal consistency coefficient of the scale was found to be 0.84 by Gürtunca and Karakale.</description>

    <measure>Friendship Relations and Anger Control Evaluation Form (FRACEF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-test and post-test</time_frame>
    <description>The Friendship Relations and Anger Control Evaluation Form was created considering the PBCP (Peer Bullying Counseling Program) content. The form was prepared to measure the happiness levels of children in friendship relationships, sample behavior information about happy friendship relationships, and their knowledge and competence levels about anger control. The Friendship Relations and Anger Control Evaluation Form consists of 5 questions, two for happy friendship relationships and three for anger control. A total of 50 points can be obtained from the form, with 10 points for each question.</description>

Evaluation of Data:&#xD;
Evaluation of the data was made in SPSS for Windows 11.5 (Chicago INC.) package program. Number, percentage, arithmetic mean, standard deviation, median, and minimum-maximum values were used in the intra-group distribution of descriptive data and scale scores. Non-parametric tests (Wilcoxon Test for intragroup difference, Man-Whitney U Test for intergroup difference) were used for statistical analysis of data that did not show normal distribution. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used in the control group with an n≥30 score for the normal distribution of the scale mean scores. Statistical significance value was accepted as p&lt;0.05.&#xD;
It is aimed that this research will be published in the Journal of School Nursing.</ipd_description>
