    <textblock>
      Amblyopia is the most common developmental vision disorder in children, caused by abnormal&#xD;
      visual experience in early life, especially a difference in refraction between the eyes, a&#xD;
      misalignment of the eye axes, a combination of both. Besides a significant reduced visual&#xD;
      acuity, the patients show deficits in 3D vision and functional vision impairment like reduced&#xD;
      reading speed, selective attention or motor control skills. The gold standard treatment for&#xD;
      amblyopia, occlusion therapy, can lead to relapses or residual amblyopia (i.e., amblyopia&#xD;
      that persist into adulthood). The current study aims to test the efficacy of a novel&#xD;
      home-based child-friendly rehabilitation program for amblyopia, Vivid Vision Home, involving&#xD;
      playing serious videogames on a virtual reality (VR) headset at home. The VR training will be&#xD;
      compared to standard care (wearing a spectacle correction) and to age-matched typically&#xD;
      developing individuals. A cross-over design will be used so that each participant will&#xD;
      receive both treatments (games, spectacles). There is a growing number of studies showing&#xD;
      benefits of binocular stimulation for visual acuity and stereovision, but provided mainly by&#xD;
      level III studies, with a need for rigorous level I or II studies, using more engaging&#xD;
      therapies, to confirm or refute the efficacy of this approach as an adjunct or replacement&#xD;
      for current amblyopia treatments. Embedding binocular stimulation in engaging, immersive&#xD;
      serious games delivered on VR headsets at home, as implemented by Vivid Vision Home, can&#xD;
      address this question.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Amblyopia is the most common developmental vision disorder in children, affecting 1-5% of the&#xD;
      population in developed countries. It mostly results from a difference in refraction between&#xD;
      the eyes (anisometropia), a misalignment of the eye axes (strabismus), a combination of both,&#xD;
      or visual deprivation (due to congenital cataract, e.g.). Besides a significant reduced&#xD;
      visual acuity, the patients show binocular dysfunction leading to functional vision&#xD;
      impairment like reduced reading speed, selective attention or motor control skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whilst the disorder is commonly diagnosed around the age of 3-5 years, up to 50% of children&#xD;
      will be left with residual amblyopia mainly due to a late diagnosis and start of treatment,&#xD;
      poor compliance with treatment, not diagnosed or considered eccentric fixation. The gold&#xD;
      standard treatment consists of the occlusion therapy, patching the dominant/healthy eye for&#xD;
      2-6 hours/day every day for several months up to years. However, an eye patch and the demand&#xD;
      to use the weaker eye for visual tasks is challenging and so poorly complied with by&#xD;
      pediatric patients. These problems in compliance lead to relapses (14-25%) or residual&#xD;
      amblyopia (i.e., poor vision that persist into adulthood) creating multiple medical and&#xD;
      social problems for the patients (including cognitive and emotional processing), their&#xD;
      families and the society.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serious videogames delivered on tablets have been developed with a more engaging strategy to&#xD;
      effectively treat amblyopia. These games focus on binocular stimulation, which targets visual&#xD;
      acuity of the amblyopic eye and three-dimensional vision (stereovision), through the&#xD;
      presentation of dichoptic images. Such dichoptic image presentation consists of showing a&#xD;
      different but complementary image in each eye so that the task can only be performed if&#xD;
      information across eyes is combined. Binocular stimulation signifies that both eyes are&#xD;
      challenged but the devices are programmed in a way so that the weaker eye is primarily&#xD;
      performing a given visual task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this project is to improve visual function of the amblyopic eye using&#xD;
      image-fusion and stereopsis through playing videogames in a Virtual Reality (VR) environment.&#xD;
      Also, besides the improvements of visual acuity and potentially stereovision, such VR-based&#xD;
      serious games interventions can positively impact other aspects like cognitive and motor&#xD;
      functions. The visual deficits seen in amblyopia are thought to be related to problems in&#xD;
      attending to visual task-relevant objects, suggesting that such deficits in&#xD;
      selective-attentional skills can hamper vision recovery. Similarly, poor stereovision will be&#xD;
      reflected in deficits in motor control skills as seen in individuals with amblyopia. Our&#xD;
      VR-based serious games training will have similar ingredients to those that are supposed to&#xD;
      improve attentional skills and may have a positive impact on motor control skills. The&#xD;
      VR-based technology developed by Vivid Vision to be used in the present study is FDA approved&#xD;
      and CE (Conformité Européene) certified. They are offering virtual reality videogames with&#xD;
      headsets, which may increase the beneficial treatment effect by a reduction of the&#xD;
      misperception of 3-dimensional movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present project aims to test the described benefit in a home-based, child-friendly&#xD;
      rehabilitation program involving serious video games in a virtual reality environment in&#xD;
      children, adolescents, and young adults with residual amblyopia, compared to standard care&#xD;
      (refractive correction) and to age-matched healthy individuals. The study has been designed&#xD;
      as a blinded randomized cross-over trial to increase the available evidence allowing for a&#xD;
      qualified evaluation of the benefit of binocular stimulation and for demonstrating a&#xD;
      beneficial effect also in residual amblyopia in childhood and in older patients.&#xD;

Red filter involves asking patient to fixate on a white circle at the end of the room and placing a red filter on the patient's fellow eye. If the patient reports a red pinkish light, their eyes are aligned, and they do not have strabismus. The location of the red circle in relation to the white circle will tell the examiner about also the type of the strabismus.</description>

    <measure>Visual selective attention: Behavioral processes</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, after each treatment (2 months) and 2 months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Spatial cuing task designed by Folk et al. (1992), adapted to the current project's aims, will be administered separately for the amblyopic/fellow and the dominant eye. Participants search for a target diamond of a predefined color (e.g. blue) in an array of differently colored bars and need to report the bar's orientation (horizontal or vertical) by pressing keyboard keys. On every trial, this search array is preceded by an array where a task-irrelevant visual distractor is present that can have the same or a different color than the target. On 50% of the trials the cues are accompanied by trials.&#xD;
Selective attention is measured behaviorally by cuing effects, i.e., the difference in speed of responding when the cue and target are in the same versus different locations.&#xD;
Strength of visual selective attention is measured by the the difference in cuing effects elicited by distractors that matched the color of the target compared to distractors that matched a different color.</description>

    <description>EEG will be recorded while participants are doing the adapted Folk et al.'s spatial cuing task (see Outcome 10).&#xD;
Traditional EEG processes of visual selective attention is measured by the N2pc event-related potential (ERP)component, a traditional marker of visual selective attention. The N2pc is a negative-going voltage deflection observed app. 200-300ms after presentation of the stimulus of interest, larger over electrodes contralateral than ipsilateral to the side of the stimulus.&#xD;

Topographic analyses of the EEG/ERPs focus on the reference-independent, multivariate characteristics of the electrical field across the whole scalp. Here, the topographic analyses involve using clustering of the group-averaged EEG/ERP activity over the time-window of the N2pc (see Outcome 11) to identify periods of stable topographic activity (topographic maps). After identification of an optimal number of the topographic maps, they are fit back into single-subject data; parameters like map duration (map onset, map offset) and global explained variance will be analysed.&#xD;

This will be done for 3 conditions: monocular dominant, monocular non-dominant, and binocular.</description>

    <description>Visually evoked potentials (VEPs) will also be measured as an electrophysiological (EEG) index of the integrity (strength) of the visual cortical pathway from the retina to the occipital cortex. VEPs originate from the occipital cortex that receives and interprets visual signals. They consist of a sequence of voltage peaks measured over the occipital electrodes: negative peak (N1), positive peak (P1), negative peak (N2). VEPs will be recorded, for each eye separately, from the responses to the color targets in the selective-attention tasks.</description>

    <measure>Pediatric Eye Questionnaire (PedEyeQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, after each treatment (2 months) and 2 months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Rasch scores for each questionnaire item will be obtained from published look-up tables available at www.pedig.net, and used to calculate a score for each amblyopic participant (Parent-PedEyeQ for &lt;18-year-olds; adapted Child-PedEyeQ for &gt;18-year-olds) and each treatment arm and group at each visit. Scores will also be converted to a 0-100 scale to aid in interpretation.&#xD;
Healthy individuals or their parents will not complete this questionnaire.&#xD;

    <measure>Adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, after experimental treatment (2 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Adherence (total amount of training hours, regularity of training) throughout the treatment will be investigated and the visual outcome will be correlated to the adherence that is automatically recorded by the Vivid Vision Home system. By including these measures of adherence to the serious games treatment, we will obtain important information, as the traditional treatment is known to have low adherence.</description>
