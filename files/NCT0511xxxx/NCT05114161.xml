  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pneumonia in children can be caused by different types of germs such as bacteria and viruses.&#xD;
      Giving antibiotics to children with bacterial bugs is helpful while giving antibiotics to&#xD;
      children with viruses will not help them. Unfortunately, it is difficult for doctors to tell&#xD;
      when a child's pneumonia is caused by bacteria or viruses. Most young children are given&#xD;
      antibiotics even though it doesn't help them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study wants to test a new way to care for children with pneumonia so that only children&#xD;
      who will benefit from antibiotics will receive them. The study will use a combination of the&#xD;
      child's symptoms, x-rays results, and lab testing to better determine if a child needs&#xD;
      antibiotics. The study team will then review the testing results and follow up with the&#xD;
      patient and their family in the following days to ensure that the child is improving. PIONEER&#xD;
      will test a novel care pathway for treating non-severe pediatric pneumonia with the goal of&#xD;
      decreasing antibiotic prescription while maintaining equal clinical outcomes to standard&#xD;
      care.&#xD;

    <description>All participants/caregivers will be asked for consent for point-of-care (POC) blood C-reactive protein (CRP), nasopharyngeal swab for virology/Mycoplasma testing, and urine for pneumococcal antigen (UAg) testing, but, since this testing will not affect care, these are optional (ie. refusal will not preclude enrolment). The RA will phone the caregiver at Day 2-5, Day 14-21, and Day 30 post-enrollment, for outcome ascertainment. Caregivers will be asked to fill out a daily diary (either electronically or on paper) to record the participant's symptoms, clinical progress, and possible drug adverse effects. Caregivers will also be instructed on how to take patient temperature. All participants whose symptoms do not progressively improve will be encouraged to return to the ED to be reassessed, as per standard of care.</description>

    <description>Once a child is diagnosed with non-severe CAP (community-acquired pneumonia) in the ED, specific radiographic findings and point-of-care CRP testing will identify those who require antibiotic treatment immediately. The next day, results of multiplex respiratory pathogen and urine pneumococcal antigen (UAg) testing will be integrated into the care plan, along with additional clinical information about the child gathered remotely, to ensure that only children at appreciable risk for bacterial infection receive antibiotics. Our care pathway uses already-available testing (NPS) in new ways, integrates newer diagnostics (point-of-care CRP, UAg), and includes properly-timed clinical follow up to change how children with non-severe CAP are managed.The research team will follow-up with the participant and caregiver the next day, 2-5 days, 7-21 days and day 30 post-enrolment to ensure clinical stability.</description>

    <description>The novel care pathway will follow a decision tree based on several criteria to stratify patients in an appropriate risk category. Patients with large radiographic lobar consolidation OR POC CRP &gt; 60mg/L will be deemed 'appreciable risk' while patients with CRP &lt; 20mg/L will be deemed 'low risk'. Patients with CRP between 20 - 60mg/L will be evaluated further, as follows: if they are not tachypneic, they will be 'low risk'; if they are tachypneic and less than 1 year of age, they will be 'appreciable risk'; if they are tachypneic, over 1 year of age, but with either complete PCV13 immunization OR detectable wheezing as per the ED clinician, they will be classified as 'low risk'. Appreciable-risk participants will be given a prescription for antibiotics at ED discharge.</description>
