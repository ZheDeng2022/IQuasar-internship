  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators established three prospective cohorts of patients with BCLC stage 0-A HCC,&#xD;
      based on different surgical approaches (open, laparoscopic and robotic). After 5 years of&#xD;
      follow-up, the investigators used propensity score matching (PSM) to reduce selection bias&#xD;
      and then compared the long-term oncological outcomes of the three different surgical&#xD;
      approaches, which might provide high-level evidence in non-randomized observational studies.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In this study, three prospective cohorts of patients with BCLC stage 0-A HCC, underwent&#xD;
      complete liver resection using different surgical approaches (OLR, LLR, and RALR), were&#xD;
      established. After adequate periods of follow-up, the long-term oncological outcomes of the&#xD;
      three different surgical approaches were compared, providing a higher level of evidence using&#xD;
      a non-randomized comparative study based on propensity score matching (PSM) analysis.&#xD;

        1669 cases underwent liver resection from July 1st 2015 to June 30th 2017 in Hepatic&#xD;
        Surgery Center, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and&#xD;
        Technology, including 186 RALR, 527 LLR, and 956 OLR. Among these patients, there were 102,&#xD;
        333, and 669 HCC patients, respectively. Ten patients were excluded due to missing data or&#xD;
        follow-up. Finally, 369 HCC patients in the early stages were included in the analysis.&#xD;
        After PSM, 168 patients were matched and there were 56 patients in each group&#xD;
