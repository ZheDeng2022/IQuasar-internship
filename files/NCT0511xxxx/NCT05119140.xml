      The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) when&#xD;
      combined with Mesalamine in reducing clinical and histologic disease activity in patients who&#xD;
      have active mild to severe Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and also to assess the immunological&#xD;
      effects of hydroxychloroquine in this population. These outcomes will be evaluated both&#xD;
      clinically and experimentally. In vitro, flow cytometry will be employed to measure the&#xD;
      expression of CTLA-4 on activated CD4+CD25+CD127- Tregs from patients prior to treatment with&#xD;
      HCQ, and then at the end of a 4 month follow up period. Suppression assays will be used to&#xD;
      determine the functional capacity of the patient derived Tregs. Clinically, patients will be&#xD;
      monitored for remission as defined by reduction in patient reported stool frequency and&#xD;
      rectal bleeding (mayo sub-score 0 or 1) and endoscopically, by improvement in mucosal&#xD;
      appearance (mayo sub-score 0 or 1), all objective measures in the mayo score.&#xD;

      This is a single arm study to evaluate the efficacy and immunological effect of administering&#xD;
      Hydroxychloroquine to patients of non-European ancestry who have active mild to severe&#xD;
      Ulcerative Colitis in spite of Mesalamine therapy. 10 Participants will be recruited in Icahn&#xD;
      School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and 10 in Emory University (20 across all sites).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants 18 years and above who identify as an individual of non-European ancestry with a&#xD;
      diagnosis of Ulcerative Colitis will be approached for the study. Participants will be&#xD;
      recruited from Mount Sinai IBD center prior to their standard of care endoscopy. Participants&#xD;
      who meet the study's inclusion criteria i.e. If they currently have active disease, they will&#xD;
      be able to receive the research medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be administered 400mg hydroxychloroquine tablets orally for four months in&#xD;
      addition to Mesalamine. Pre and post medication clinical, endoscopic and immunological&#xD;
      assessments will be compared. Participants will also be followed up with bi-monthly phone&#xD;
      calls. Participants will have a post medication colonoscopy at the end of the 4 month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a risk of retinopathy and cardiomyopathy associated with long term use of the study&#xD;
      drug at doses greater than 6.5mg/kg for more than 5 years. Participants will be screened for&#xD;
      existing eye and heart disease and monitored pre and post medication for any new adverse&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
