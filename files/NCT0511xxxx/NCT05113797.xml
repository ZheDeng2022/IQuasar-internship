  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Assessing and improving movement quality are important components of rehabilitation. The&#xD;
      Lower Quarter Y-Balance Test (YBT-LQ) is a balance test used to assess dynamic balance in&#xD;
      healthy adults, athletes, and those who are rehabilitating a lower extremity injury.&#xD;
      Performing the YBT-LQ requires utilization of different strategies. It is unknown how&#xD;
      different practice conditions will affect dynamic balance learning or performance on YBT-LQ.&#xD;
      This study aims to compare the influence of OPTIMAL motor learning practice with standard&#xD;
      practice conditions on YBT-LQ measurements.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The Lower Quarter Y-Balance Test (YBT-LQ) is used to assess dynamic balance and functional&#xD;
      symmetry in healthy adults, athletes, and those who are rehabilitating a lower extremity&#xD;
      injury, and has good to excellent interrater reliability. Performing the YBT-LQ requires&#xD;
      utilization of different neuromotor and postural control strategies in each direction of the&#xD;
      test. The OPTIMAL theory of motor learning is a theoretical framework that has been shown to&#xD;
      improve motor performance through three main components: promotion of autonomy support (AS),&#xD;
      presence of an external focus (EF) of attention, and implementation of enhanced expectancies&#xD;
      (EE) placed upon a task. These components of the OPTIMAL theory of motor learning have been&#xD;
      demonstrated to enhance balance learning in several populations. There is also extensive&#xD;
      literature on the effects of the individual components of the OPTIMAL theory of motor&#xD;
      learning and some evidence that demonstrates the beneficial effects of the combined&#xD;
      components on motor learning. However, to the authors knowledge, literature has not been&#xD;
      published upon the effect of all three components of the OPTIMAL theory of motor learning on&#xD;
      dynamic balance learning. Therefore, the purpose of this study is intended to determine if&#xD;
      the OPTIMAL theory of motor learning will influence performance on the YBT-LQ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy participants aged 18 to 65 will be recruited for participation through word-of-mouth&#xD;
      advertising. Inclusion criteria will include a passing score of &gt;35 degrees bilateral ankle&#xD;
      dorsiflexion and an ability to balance on one leg. Upon signing the informed consent document&#xD;
      from participants, height, weight, BMI, gender, age, and limb length will be recorded for&#xD;
      data analysis. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: an OPTIMAL motor&#xD;
      learning group or a control group. The intended experimental design will be a multigroup&#xD;
      nonequivalent pretest-posttest control group for this study. Participants will attend two&#xD;
      study visits separated by 2-14 days. A visit one baseline YBT-LQ pretest will be administered&#xD;
      in a standardized fashion the same for both groups. During visit two, the OPTIMAL group will&#xD;
      practice the YBT-LQ using OPTIMAL principles, while the control group practices the YBT-LQ&#xD;
      using standard principles, then both groups will undergo a posttest YBT-LQ measurement.&#xD;
      Primary outcome measures will be normalized composite scores of the YBT-LQ. Secondary outcome&#xD;
      measures will be participant self-reported measures of perceived competence, task effort,&#xD;
      level of autonomy, and externally focused attention during the task on a 0 to 10 Likert&#xD;
      scale.&#xD;
