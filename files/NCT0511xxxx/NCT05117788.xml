      Evidence of the clinical diagnostic accuracy and operational characteristics of the Bioneer&#xD;
      Accupower Q-RFIA PCR kit on IRON qPCR is needed to comprehensively evaluate Bioneer RFIA&#xD;
      validity and inform global and national policy decision-making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rapid diagnosis and appropriate treatment of M/XDR-TB is essential to prevent significant&#xD;
      morbidity, mortality and further transmission of disease. The FQ are key components of the&#xD;
      new bedaquiline-containing 6-9 month regimen, and so it is necessary to rule-out resistance&#xD;
      to these compounds prior to treating patients with the shorter regimen. Currently there are&#xD;
      no WHO endorsed tests that can identify resistance to both first and second-line drugs in one&#xD;
      reaction.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria comprise absence of informed consent, insufficient sample volume or&#xD;
      number, only extra-pulmonary TB signs &amp; symptoms, and receipt of any dose of TB treatment&#xD;
      within six months prior to enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoints 1.1 Sensitivity and specificity estimates for MTB detection 1.2 Sensitivity&#xD;
      and specificity estimates for INH resistance detection 1.3 Sensitivity and specificity&#xD;

      resistance detection 1.5 Sensitivity and specificity estimates for AG resistance detection&#xD;
      1.6 Assessment of Bioneer Accupower Q-RFIA PCR kit on IRON qPCR technical performance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints 2.1 Assessment of additional Bioneer Accupower Q-RFIA PCR kit on IRON&#xD;
      qPCR performance characteristics&#xD;
&#xD;
      GCP statement This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, the Declaration&#xD;
      of Helsinki, ICH-GCP, ISO 13485: 2016 (if applicable) as well as all national legal and&#xD;
      regulatory requirements.&#xD;
