      This early phase I trial evaluates blood samples to see if patients undergoing standard of&#xD;
      care treatment with either stereotactic body radiation therapy or percutaneous ablation&#xD;
      (using radio waves to create heat to destroy the tumor), have an increase in serum immune&#xD;
      markers in kidney cancer. Information gained from this study may help doctors make treatment&#xD;
      decisions for patients with kidney cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Compare pre- and post-treatment immune markers and peripheral blood mononuclear cell&#xD;
      (PBMC) characteristics in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients overall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Compare pre- and post-treatment immune markers and PBMC characteristics between patients&#xD;
      being treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) versus percutaneous&#xD;
      cryoablation (PCA) and are also undergoing immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Compare pre- and post-treatment immune markers and PBMC characteristics in patients&#xD;
      being treated with either SBRT or PCA and not undergoing immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Assess the impact of post-treatment immune markers and PBMC characteristics on distant&#xD;
      disease progression in metastatic RCC patients overall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo blood sample collection at baseline prior to SBRT or PCA, then at 14 days, 3&#xD;
      and 6 months after SBRT or PCA.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in immune markers and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) characteristics from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Immune markers and PBMC characteristics will be evaluated overall. For change from baseline, comparisons between groups will be done using Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA), including the pre-treatment count as a covariate in the model along with group status. The change will be described between groups reporting the mean and inter-quartile range. Linear regression will be used, analysis of covariance for change, for multiple variable models that will include any relevant baseline disease and patient characteristics.</description>

    <description>Each CD8+ T cell will be compared between the SBRT and PCA groups using a two-sample T test at each of the time points as well as for percent change from baseline. For change from baseline, comparisons between groups will be done using ANCOVA, including the pre-treatment count as a covariate in the model along with group status. The change will be described between groups reporting the mean and inter-quartile range. Linear regression will be used, analysis of covariance for change, for multiple variable models that will include any relevant baseline disease and patient characteristics.</description>
