  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see whether the study drug, amivantamab, is an effective&#xD;
      treatment for people with EGFR- or MET-amplified esophagogastric cancer. The researchers will&#xD;
      also look at whether amivantamab is a safe treatment that causes few or mild side effects in&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will receive amivantamab intravenously weekly for the first cycle, and biweekly subsequently at a dose of 1050mg (patients &lt;80kg) or 1400mg (patients ≥80kg). The initial dose will be administered over 2 days in split doses in order to mitigate the risk of infusion reactions. Therapy will continue for up to 2 years or until progression of disease, initiation of alternative cancer therapy, unacceptable toxicity, or other reason to discontinue treatment occurs-whichever comes first.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive amivantamab weekly for the first cycle, and biweekly subsequently at a dose of 1050mg (&lt;80kg) or 1400mg (&gt;80kg). The first day of dosing is considered Cycle 1 Day 1. Each cycle is 28 days in duration. The initial dose will be administered over 2 days to prevent infusion reactions. For patients who weigh &lt;80 kg, amivantamab 350mg IV will be given on Cycle 1 Day 1, and the remaining 700mg IV will be given on Cycle 1 Day 2. Patients will continue to receive amivantamab 1050mg IV once a week during Cycle 1 then biweekly (Days 1 and 15) of each subsequent Cycle. For patients who weigh ≥ 80 kg, 350mg IV amivantamab will be given on Cycle 1 Day 1 and 1050mg IV will be given on Cycle 1 Day 2. Patients will continue to receive amivantamab 1400mg IV once a week during Cycle 1 then biweekly (Days 1 and 15) of each subsequent Cycle.</description>
