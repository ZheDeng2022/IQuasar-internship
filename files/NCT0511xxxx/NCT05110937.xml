  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adverse outcomes in surgical sepsis patients are secondary to dysregulated emergency&#xD;
      myelopoiesis, and expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells. Here we propose to determine&#xD;
      the underlying mechanisms behind the increased expansion of these leukocyte populations and&#xD;
      the underlying mechanisms that drive inflammation and immune suppression.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our overarching hypothesis is that the consequences of surgical sepsis (death and poor&#xD;
      quality of life) are the result of an unresolving host leukocyte dyscrasia, similar to other&#xD;
      chronic conditions such as cancer and autoimmune disease. Specifically, the preferential&#xD;
      expansion and self-perpetuation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), propagated in&#xD;
      part through epigenetic changes in both bone marrow (BM) progenitors and MDSCs, drives&#xD;
      non-acute infectious and noninfectious complications after sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Program will investigate in human surgical sepsis the underlying mechanisms that drive&#xD;
      'dysfunctional myelopoiesis', expansion of MDSC populations, suppressed T-cell&#xD;
      quantities/function, and the development of patient's immunosuppressive/inflammatory&#xD;
      endotypes. We will primarily focus on how MDSC expansion evolves over time in an&#xD;
      observational study that follows surgical sepsis patients who do or do not rapidly recover.&#xD;
      There are three specific aims: Aim 1. To test the hypothesis that perpetuation of host MDSCs&#xD;
      after acute surgical sepsis drives poor long-term clinical outcomes in surgical sepsis,&#xD;
      including but not limited to increased secondary infections. Aim 2. To test the hypothesis&#xD;
      that failure to recover from surgical sepsis is driven by modifiable epigenetic alterations&#xD;
      in circulating MDSCs that induce and prolong immunosuppressive endotypes. Aim 3. To identify&#xD;
      the distinct immunosuppressive mechanisms of MDSCs from surgical sepsis patients over time,&#xD;
      including immunometabolism, check-point inhibition, reactive oxygen and nitrogen production,&#xD;
      and substrate availability. Using the established clinical infrastructure of the Sepsis and&#xD;
      Critical Illness Research Center (SCIRC), a team science approach will be employed with&#xD;
      collaborating PI's coming from multiple clinical and basic science disciplines.&#xD;

        Patients admitted to surgical and trauma intensive care units who screen positive for&#xD;
        sepsis and are being treated by our standard-of-care sepsis protocol are candidates for the&#xD;
        studies proposed in this proposal. For the purpose of these studies, sepsis will be defined&#xD;
        using the new Sepsis-3 criteria.&#xD;
