  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, prospective, comparative and non-interventional cohort study&#xD;
      involving two cohorts, one cohort (Inclisiran Cohort) of patients treated with inclisiran in&#xD;
      certain special territories in China (eg. Bo'ao Pilot Zone) and the other cohort (SoC&#xD;
      Historical Cohort) of patients treated with standard of care (SoC) in routine clinical&#xD;
      practice from EMR database.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will utilize real-world data from EMR database to serve as the 'external&#xD;
      control'.The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of inclisiran as an add-on&#xD;
      therapy (or monotherapy in statin-intolerant cases) in real-world settings, with current SoC&#xD;
      in a matched historical cohort of patients who receive SoC in EMR database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients in Inclisiran Cohort will received inclisiran injection (300 mg s.c.) under the&#xD;
      guidance of physicians, and based on the approved label, which recommends a second dose on 90&#xD;
      days after the first injection, and then followed by injections every 6 months afterwards&#xD;
      until the end of study (EOS). However, the treatment decision and exact visit timepoint will&#xD;
      be purely decided by physicians and patients.&#xD;
