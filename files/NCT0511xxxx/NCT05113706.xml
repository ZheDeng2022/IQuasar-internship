      The study aims to investigate bystander's emotional stress state in of out-of-hospital&#xD;
      cardiac arrest (OHCA) emergency calls and the association with the quality of&#xD;
      dispatcher-assisted cardiopulmonary resuscitation (DA-CPR).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Delayed CPR is believed to be a important factor in the outcome of out-of-hospital cardiac&#xD;
      arrest (OHCA). Bystander's emotional stress state might affect recognition of cardiac arrest&#xD;
      and the resuscitation attempt. The study aims to investigate the association between a&#xD;
      bystander's emotional stress state in the beginning of the emergency call in out-of-hospital&#xD;
      cardiac arrest (OHCA) and dispatcher-assisted cardiopulmonary resuscitation (DA-CPR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a retrospective and observational study of OHCA emergency calls from the capital&#xD;
      region of Denmark from 01.09.2018 - 01.11.2019. The audio recordings of the emergency calls&#xD;
      will be obtained from the emergency medical service database. A code catalogue with&#xD;
      standardised default descriptions to each variable will be used. The study will only include&#xD;
      the first person whom the medical dispatcher talk to. The rating of the calls will be&#xD;
      performed by five observers outside of the research group, who have no conflict of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of the present study will be to investigate an association between a&#xD;
      bystander's emotional stress state in the beginning of the emergency call of OHCA and the&#xD;
      time until first chest compression. Secondarily, the study investigated the association&#xD;
      between the bystander's emotional stress and:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Time to recognition of OHCA, time to initiate CPR, and time to first compression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assessment of OHCA by the medical dispatcher (Does the dispatcher address patient&#xD;
           breathing status and consciousness) (Yes/No)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The quality of DA-CPR instructions:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Was the medical dispatcher motivating and encouraging when giving instructions&#xD;
                (Yes/No)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Was the medical dispatcher assertive or passive when giving instructions (Yes/No)&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Did the medical dispatcher instruct on depth and speed of compressions (Yes/No)&#xD;
                Information about caller such as gender and relationship to the patient will also&#xD;
                be included in the analyse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive analysis of baseline characteristics of emergency calls and dispatchers will be&#xD;
      performed by frequency distributions (N %) stratified by emotional stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use logistic regression on categorical variables to analyse differences in the&#xD;
      quality of DA-CPR based on the emotional stress state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wilcoxon rank sum test will be used on non-normally distributed continuous variables to&#xD;
      analyse differences in time until first chest compression. Two-way ANOVA will be used to&#xD;
      analyse the mean of quantitative variables according to the levels of categorical variables.&#xD;
      Furthermore, failure analysis was used to analyse and visualise differences in time until&#xD;
      chest compressions based on the emotional stress state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kappa statistics were used to assess inter-rater variability and agreement between the&#xD;
      reviewers. We reached a Kappa score of overall agreement 0.72%, which provides a substantial&#xD;
      agreement between the raters.&#xD;
