      The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of a new cordless ultrasonic dissection&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Sonicision device offers the ability to achieve hemostasis and vessel dissection with a&#xD;
      cordless system. The ultrasonic device yields coagulation and transection of vessels by&#xD;
      conversion of electrical energy into ultrasonic vibration through a piezoelectric or magnetic&#xD;
      transducer, which is the causation of heat induction at the jaws of the instrument through&#xD;
      friction. The Sonicision device is able to seal vessels up to 5 mm and transection division&#xD;
      of 10 cm segments. The Sonicision device features the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Cordless design to improve freedom and movement;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Simplified set up that may possibly increase operating room efficiency;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Dual-mode energy control to increase procedure focus;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Improved mobility secondary to cordless system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently all devices are connected to a generator by a cable, which can lead to the cable&#xD;
      wrapping around the device, tangle with other instruments and become inadvertently&#xD;
      contaminated. There are several advantages with regards to utilization of a cordless device&#xD;
      to include: improved intra-operative storage, avoidance of bundling multiple cords from&#xD;
      various instruments that may limit instrument mobility and portability which may lead to the&#xD;
      ability to operate with advanced surgical equipment in third world settings, trauma and&#xD;
      surgery centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study group will consist of 150 patients, male and female adults, who present with the&#xD;
      need for general surgery in which an ultrasonic dissection device and/or a vessel sealing&#xD;
      device will be utilized. Patients will be identified prospectively via consultation with the&#xD;
      general surgeon. Data will be collected addressing the following variables: versatility,&#xD;
      dissection time, vessel diameter, reliability, efficiency, tissue response, steam production,&#xD;
      blood loss, tissue response, thermal spread, desiccation and sealing time. A tentative total&#xD;
      of ten individual tissue specimens will be obtained by the surgeon during surgery and after&#xD;
      the utilization of the Sonicision Cordless Ultrasonic Dissection System. The patient's&#xD;
      histologic sample will be followed after surgery in order to determine efficacy of the vessel&#xD;
      seal. Subsequently, the patient's information will be deidentified and the patient assigned a&#xD;
      study number to which all further analysis will be tied. Patient participation will include&#xD;
      time of surgery through discharge from the hospital. Study data will be collected and managed&#xD;
      utilizing an electronic database.&#xD;
