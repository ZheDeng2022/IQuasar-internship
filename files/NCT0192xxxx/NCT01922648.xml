  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is a virus that causes chest infections. It is the single&#xD;
      most important cause of severe respiratory illness in infants and young children, and severe&#xD;
      RSV infection early in life is associated with an increased risk of later developing asthma.&#xD;
      RSV also causes severe disease in elderly and immune-compromised adults, and the amount of&#xD;
      RSV disease in the elderly is similar to that from seasonal flu. The virus is transmitted in&#xD;
      the secretions of the upper respiratory tract of infected individuals and by contact with&#xD;
      contaminated surfaces (such as toys). Hospital outbreaks, especially on paediatric and&#xD;
      neonatal wards, are not uncommon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infection by RSV does not develop a natural long-lasting protection against re-infection&#xD;
      (like, for example, measles does). In the USA nearly all children by 24 months of age have&#xD;
      been infected at least once with RSV, and about half will have experienced two infections.&#xD;
      There is no effective anti-viral drug to treat an infection and the only way of managing&#xD;
      cases of severe infection is through supporting organs, such as the lungs, to withstand and&#xD;
      recover from the illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There remains a real need to develop an effective vaccine to prevent severe infections caused&#xD;
      by RSV. A better understanding of the way the immune system responds to RSV in children would&#xD;
      aid the development of such a vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to increase our understanding of how the immune system responds&#xD;
      to RSV. Only limited data is available on some important components of the immune response&#xD;
      and this study is designed to measure these in more detail. This is done using a single blood&#xD;
      sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 35 children are anticipated to be recruited to this study, at ages when we expect&#xD;
      to see differences in the immune response to RSV;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  5 infants aged between 2 and 4 months (Group 1), who have not yet been exposed to RSV&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  20 infants aged between 6 and 12 months (Group 2), who will have had exposure to one&#xD;
           single RSV season in the winter of 2011/12&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  10 children aged between 3 and 6 years (Group 3), who have been exposed to RSV over&#xD;
           several winter seasons&#xD;
