      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical performance of the one-step Fyodor&#xD;
      Urine Malaria Test (UMT), to determine its accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) for the&#xD;
      diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in febrile patients. A total of 1500 properly&#xD;
      consented children and adults presenting with fever (axillary temperature ≥37.5°C) or history&#xD;
      of fever in the last 48 hours (Group 1), 250 apparently &quot;healthy&quot; individuals (Control, Group&#xD;
      2), and 50 patients with Schistosoma hematobium and Rheumatoid arthritis (Group 3), will be&#xD;
      recruited. Matched urine and fingerprick (capillary) blood samples will be collected and&#xD;
      tested using the UMT and, Binax NOW® malaria rapid diagnostic test (blood test) and thick&#xD;
      smear microscopy, respectively. The overall agreement of the UMT results to the Binax NOW&#xD;
      analysis and thick smear microscopy will be used to establish UMT sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity.&#xD;

      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the clinical performance (sensitivity and specificity) of Fyodor UMT for&#xD;
      detecting Plasmodium falciparum malaria in febrile patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To monitor time-to-clearance of the cognate parasite protein from patient urine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the potential effects of proteinuria, inflammation and anti-fever medications&#xD;
           on Fyodor UMT performance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine UMT performance when used for asymptomatic (afebrile) individuals, who may&#xD;
           be carriers of the parasite.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomized, multi-center clinical study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be recruited from primary healthcare centers across four local&#xD;
           government areas in Lagos State, and two schistosomiasis communities in Abeokuta-North&#xD;
           Local Government Area of Ogun State, both in southwest Nigeria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1500 participants (comprising children aged 2-14 years and adults of both genders) with&#xD;
           fever (axillary temperature ≥37.5°C) or recent history of fever in the last 48 hours&#xD;
           (Group 1), 250 apparently &quot;healthy&quot; individuals (Control, Group 2), and 50 patients with&#xD;
           Schistosoma hematobium and Rheumatoid arthritis (Group 3), will be recruited&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Binax NOW RDT-positive patients will be treated for malaria infection with&#xD;
           Artesunate-Amodiaquine or Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine Sulphate, following national&#xD;
           treatment policy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess if the UMT target antigen persists in urine after treatment, 100 treated Group&#xD;
           1 participants with both Binax NOW and UMT positive results will be randomly selected&#xD;
           and followed up on days 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28, using an adaptation of the WHO (2009)&#xD;
           Protocol for Drug Therapeutic Efficacy Assessments&#xD;
           (http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2009/9789241597531_eng.pdf)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To test the clinical specificity of the UMT, active recruitment will include 250&#xD;
           individuals of both genders with asymptomatic P. falciparum malaria infection&#xD;
           (apparently &quot;healthy, normal control group 2), and 50 with Schistosoma haematobium&#xD;
           infection and/or rheumatoid arthritis (Group 3) - two unrelated medical conditions known&#xD;
           to elicit proteinuria in patients (Lehman et al., 1975; Adebajo et al., 1994; Tighe &amp;&#xD;
           Carson, 1997)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants with elevated Rheumatoid Factor (RF+) test result (i.e. RF &gt;60 u/mL or&#xD;
           &gt;1:80 liter) are associated with severe rheumatoid disease. Schistosoma haematobium&#xD;
           infection is confirmed by microscopy with egg identification or by serology&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This 6-month study will be implemented July-December 2013, during both rainy and dry&#xD;
           seasons when malaria transmission is high and low, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Area:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be coordinated by The ANDI Center of Excellence for Malaria Diagnosis - an&#xD;
      International Malaria Microscopy Training &amp; RDT Quality Assurance Testing center, &amp; a&#xD;
      WHO/TDR/FIND Malaria Specimen Bank Site at the College of Medicine, The University of Lagos.&#xD;
      It will be conducted in seven primary healthcare facilities across four local government&#xD;
      areas in Lagos State. Lagos State is situated in the southwestern part of Nigeria, and made&#xD;
      up of densely populated urban areas and sprawling suburban areas. Malaria transmission occurs&#xD;
      throughout the year with periods of intense seasonal malaria transmission during the rainy&#xD;
      season. Temperatures are usually high and water pools created during the rainy season provide&#xD;
      breeding sites for the malaria vectors, leading to epidemic outbreaks with high morbidity&#xD;
      rates. The state is endemic for malaria, with peak transmission between April-September.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sampling for Schistosomiasis will be carried out in Imalodo and Abuletutu schistosomiasis&#xD;
      communities in Abeokuta-North Local Government Area of Ogun State, also in southwest Nigeria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of the study are to determine the clinical sensitivity and specificity of&#xD;
      the UMT, and to establish assay performance characteristics in healthy asymptomatic&#xD;
      volunteers, compared to blood smear microscopy, and Binax NOW test (Predicate device). A&#xD;
      total of 1,800 participants, comprising children and adults of both genders presenting with&#xD;
      malaria-like fever symptoms, patients with unrelated medical conditions (Schistosoma&#xD;
      hematobium infection and rheumatoid arthritis, as well as apparently &quot;healthy&quot; (asymptomatic)&#xD;
      control individuals will be enrolled. Febrile patients with malaria-like symptoms will be&#xD;
      enrolled during both the rainy and dry seasons, yielding field samples during periods of both&#xD;
      high and low malaria transmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Matched urine and fingerprick blood samples will be collected and tested using the UMT, and&#xD;
      Binax NOW and microscopy, respectively. Urine and blood testing with the UMT and Binax NOW,&#xD;
      respectively, will be performed on-site in a blinded fashion. Each urine sample will also be&#xD;
      tested using a urinalysis dipstick and its' physicochemical characteristics (pH, protein,&#xD;
      sugar, specific gravity, etc) are recorded. Two thin and thick blood smear slides (prepared&#xD;
      on the same slide) per participant will be prepared from the blood specimen. One slide will&#xD;
      be independently read by two microscopists at the ANDI Center of Excellence for Malaria&#xD;
      Diagnosis, an internationally reputed training and referral center for malaria microscopy.&#xD;
      The second slide will be archived for future quality assurance purpose, and thereafter&#xD;
      shipped to Fyodor along with the remaining urine samples. Per convention, microscopic reading&#xD;
      of blood smears will be used as the gold standard for malaria diagnosis. Patients testing&#xD;
      positive with Binax NOW will be treated with Artesunate-Amodiaquine or&#xD;
      Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine Sulphate. No clinical decision will be made based on the UMT&#xD;
      results alone. Nevertheless, the standard routine malaria diagnostic tests will be used to&#xD;
      manage the patient in the facility where they present. The overall agreement of the UMT and&#xD;
      Binax NOW to microscopy analysis will be used to establish UMT sensitivity, specificity, and&#xD;
      substantial equivalence/non-inferiority to Binax NOW test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      UMT Test Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Add 200 µl of the freshly collected urine into a 1.5 ml or 2 ml test tube immediately&#xD;
           before testing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dip the UMT strip into the urine sample and allow sample to wick up and saturate the&#xD;
           strip for 10 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Remove the strip from the urine specimen, and place on its foil pouch packaging&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Allow reaction to proceed for 20 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record result as positive (POS; both Test and Control Lines appear), negative (NEG; only&#xD;
           the Control Line appears) or invalid (INV; Control Line does not appear).&#xD;
&#xD;
