    <textblock>
      This is a study to determine if there are reflexes that detect changes in eardrum position or&#xD;
      in the pressure of middle-ear gases and respond with changes in the ease by which the&#xD;
      Eustachian tube is opened. The Eustachian tube is the normal tube that connects the middle&#xD;
      ear to the nose. It is usually closed, but can be opened by contraction of 2 small muscles&#xD;
      that surround the tube. If the Eustachian tube does not open frequently enough, the pressure&#xD;
      in the middle ear will decrease, the eardrum will be pulled in toward the middle ear causing&#xD;
      a hearing loss, and fluid will accumulate in the middle ear to try and stabilize its&#xD;
      pressure. There is some evidence that the changes in eardrum position and middle-ear pressure&#xD;
      when the Eustachian tube does not open frequently enough can be detected by the brain that,&#xD;
      in turn, sends signals to the Eustachian tube and its muscles to make Eustachian tube opening&#xD;
      easier. In this study, we will test this possibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, in 3 experiments done on 5 different days, we will move the eardrum in and out,&#xD;
      apply different pressures to the middle ear, or change the composition of the gases in the&#xD;
      middle ear while we measure how difficult it is to open the Eustachian tube by increasing&#xD;
      middle-ear pressure or by measuring the &quot;readiness&quot; of the Eustachian tube muscles to&#xD;
      contract and open the tube.&#xD;

      Adequate middle ear (ME) pressure-regulation, defined as the maintenance of a total ME&#xD;
      pressure at approximately ambient levels, is required for normal hearing and to preserve ME&#xD;
      health. The mechanism of ME pressure-regulation consists of two distinct components that&#xD;
      affect total ME gas pressure: the bolus, total gradient driven exchange of gases between the&#xD;
      ME and nasopharynx during active, transient Eustachian tube (ET) openings and the passive,&#xD;
      partial-pressure gradient driven diffusive exchange of gases between the ME cavity and&#xD;
      adjacent compartments. A large number of past studies have described the basic physiology of&#xD;
      gas transfers through the ET in humans, but few have explored the possibility that&#xD;
      physiological feedback mechanisms could modulate ET functional efficiency. However, there is&#xD;
      an anatomic foundation to support feedback modulation of ET function and the results for some&#xD;
      experiments in animals lend credibility to that possibility. Theoretically, the sensory&#xD;
      components of possible feedback pathways could consist of stretch sensors in the tympanic&#xD;
      membrane (TM; detecting position) and tensor tympani muscle (detecting tension) and/or chemo-&#xD;
      (detecting gas pressures)/ baro- (detecting total pressure) receptors in the ME mucosa and&#xD;
      effector components consisting of resting Tensor Veli Palatini muscle (mTVP) tonus and/or the&#xD;
      extant ET periluminal pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we explore 3 hypothesized stimulus-effector pairings in 10 otherwise healthy&#xD;
      adult subjects with no history of significant ME disease and normal audiologic testing.&#xD;
      Custom ear plugs will be made for use in Visits 2-6. The protocol includes 1 screening visit&#xD;
      and 3 experiments requiring 5 experimental sessions of approximately 3-5 hours duration each&#xD;
      done at a minimum interval of 2 days. Briefly, in Experiment 1 (Visit 2), ear canal pressure&#xD;
      will be varied to change the position of the TM while simultaneously monitoring mTVP tonus by&#xD;
      electromyography (EMG). Then, a unilateral ventilation tube (VT) inserted into the TM to&#xD;
      allow access to the ME cavity. For Experiment 2, (Visits 3-5), the ME will be washed with&#xD;
      physiologic, hypercarbic, and hyperoxic gas compositions (reference ME normal) while&#xD;
      monitoring the ET periluminal tissue pressures measured as the ET resistance to gas flow. For&#xD;
      Experiment 3 (Visit 6), total ME pressure will be varied while monitoring mTVP tonus by EMG.&#xD;
      At the completion of Experiment 3, the VT will be removed and, then, the subjects will be&#xD;
      followed weekly (Visits 7+) until documented healing of the TM at which time a standard&#xD;
      audiologic assessment will be done. If the hypotheses are supported, selected activation of&#xD;
      the feedback mechanisms would improve ET function and could be exploited as one component of&#xD;
      a treatment protocol to improve ME pressure-regulation.&#xD;
