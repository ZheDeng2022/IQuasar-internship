    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether dehydrated human amnion/chorion membrane&#xD;
      (dHACM) is more effective than another commercially available product or conservative&#xD;
      measures alone when used to treat diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, stratified, randomized, controlled, comparative, parallel group,&#xD;
      multi-center clinical trial comparing the proportion of ulcers completely healed by use of&#xD;
      dehydrated human amnion/chorion membrane (dHACM) placed weekly versus placement of&#xD;
      bioengineered skin substitute (BSS) placed weekly, versus standard of care in diabetic&#xD;
      patients with a diabetic foot ulcer who have adequate arterial perfusion as defined in&#xD;
      section, 2.0 (Patient Eligibility), for wound healing to the affected limb.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients age 18 or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient is willing to provide informed consent and is willing to participate in all&#xD;
             procedures and follow up evaluations necessary to complete the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient's ulcer must be diabetic in origin and larger than 1 cm2. Note: Debridement&#xD;
             will be done prior to randomization. Subject's informed consent for participating in&#xD;
             this study, must be obtained prior to proceeding with sharp debridement.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes (criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes&#xD;
             mellitus per ADA).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Ulcer must be present for a minimum of four weeks before enrollment/ randomization,&#xD;
             with documented failure of conventional ulcer therapy to heal the wound. A two week&#xD;
             run-in period will precede enrollment/ randomization in the trial to document the&#xD;
             indolent nature of the wounds selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Additional wounds may be present but not within 3 cm of the study wound.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Wound must be present anatomically on the foot as defined by beginning below the&#xD;
             malleoli of the ankle and be neuropathic in origin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patient's ulcer must exhibit no clinical signs of infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
