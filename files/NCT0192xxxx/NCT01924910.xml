  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a single dose of vitamin D administered orally&#xD;
      in the fall will provide adequate vitamin D in healthy individuals for the duration of the&#xD;
      winter, during which vitamin D levels are known to decrease. The investigators are also&#xD;
      interested in finding out if this level of vitamin D will provide adequate levels for the&#xD;
      remainder of the year. While the benefits of once-yearly vitamin D administration are clear&#xD;
      for patients with osteoporosis, osteomalacia, rickets, and other conditions associated with&#xD;
      vitamin D deficiency and high bone turn-over, studies have not been performed in which high&#xD;
      doses of vitamin D were used to prevent the seasonal decline of vitamin D concentrations in&#xD;
      healthy individuals. These findings could provide evidence to support vitamin D&#xD;
      administration to healthy individuals in the wintertime to improve health outcomes, and&#xD;
      provide the basis for additional studies in both healthy and sick populations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin D, synthesized from 7-dehydrocholesterol during ultraviolet- B exposure, aids in the&#xD;
      absorption of calcium from the G.I. tract. Indirectly, by maintaining optimal calcium&#xD;
      homeostasis, adequate vitamin D concentrations are essential in skeletal health (by&#xD;
      preventing rickets and osteomalacia), cardiovascular health (by lowering the risk for&#xD;
      hypertension), and ultimately decreasing mortality. Due to decreased direct sunlight&#xD;
      exposures in the winter (characterized by limited outdoor activity, increased clothing&#xD;
      coverage, and angle of the sun), vitamin D concentrations are shown to decline in individuals&#xD;
      over the winter. Once-yearly administration of a bolus of vitamin D offers a means of&#xD;
      preventing the seasonal decline in vitamin D status and preventing vitamin D deficiency. If&#xD;
      proven successful, a once-yearly dose of vitamin D would provide improved compliance relative&#xD;
      to daily or monthly dosing and provide an inexpensive and easy way to ensure optimal&#xD;
      concentrations of vitamin D year-round.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study plans to investigate if once a year dosing with vitamin D during the winter&#xD;
      months in self-identified healthy adults will be effective in maintaining optimal vitamin D&#xD;
      status for the entire year. In brief, this study will be a randomized, double blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy of 250,000 IU of vitamin D3 compared to&#xD;
      placebo given once in 30 healthy individuals (15 subjects per arm) in November. The serum&#xD;
      25(OH)D (the best measurable level of vitamin D status) will be measured after both 3-4&#xD;
      months and 1 year to determine the efficacy of the dose relative to the 15 healthy controls.&#xD;
      The intent of this clinical investigation is not to evaluate the dietary supplement's ability&#xD;
      to diagnose, cure, mitigate or prevent disease. This study is to evaluate blood&#xD;
      concentrations of this regimen of vitamin D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultimately, this study hopes to determine if a single dose of vitamin D administered orally&#xD;
      in the fall will provide adequate vitamin D in healthy young individuals for the 3 months&#xD;
      during winter, during which vitamin D levels are known to decrease, and over the entire year.&#xD;
      These findings could provide evidence to support vitamin D administration to healthy&#xD;
      individuals in wintertime to improve health outcomes, and provide the basis for additional&#xD;
      studies in both healthy and sick populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes of this study will evaluate other hypothesized effects of vitamin D on&#xD;
      biomarkers affecting health status and immunity, including markers of inflammation and&#xD;
      markers of iron status.&#xD;
