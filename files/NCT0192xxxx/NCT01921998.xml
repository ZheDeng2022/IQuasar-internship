  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Side effects from chemotherapy can be severe in some patients leading to admission to&#xD;
      hospital, a worse quality of life and delays in subsequent doses of chemotherapy. A blood&#xD;
      test that could predict patients who will go on to develop severe side effects could be&#xD;
      useful and might allow early intervention with medicines to reduce the severity of the&#xD;
      symptoms and prevent admission to hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will collect blood samples from patients with lymphoma or sarcoma who are&#xD;
      receiving chemotherapy (with an expected admission rate for neutropenic sepsis, one of the&#xD;
      side effects that most commonly results in hospital admission, of less than 20%). It will&#xD;
      assess whether changes in blood proteins (&quot;biomarkers&quot;) taken 2 days after the 1st&#xD;
      chemotherapy can predict subsequent severe side effects throughout the 4 months of&#xD;
      chemotherapy. In addition the investigators will collect data on quality of life and contact&#xD;
      with medical professionals to assess the costs of chemotherapy toxicity to both the patient&#xD;
      and health service. This will allow us in the future to model the cost effectiveness of using&#xD;
      biomarkers in this manner to try and reduce chemotherapy toxicity.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with lymphoma or sarcoma identified to receive out-patient chemotherapy with&#xD;
             an anticipated febrile neutropenia rate of less than 20%. This would include 21 day&#xD;
             R-CHOP in patients under 70 and single agent doxorubicin [Aapro et al, 2011a].&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18 or older&#xD;

          -  Performance Status 0-2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Before patient registration, written informed consent must be given according to&#xD;
             ICH/GCP, and national regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Past history of HIV, Hepatitis B or C positive, due to the difficulties in handling&#xD;
             high-risk specimens within CEP.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Presence of any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition&#xD;
             potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule; those&#xD;
