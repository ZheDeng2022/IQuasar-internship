    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to test whether, compared to the normal Standard of Care at&#xD;
      primary health care clinics, a home-based counseling intervention ( the 'Amagugu' Counseling&#xD;
      Intervention), will increase the number of HIV-infected mothers who are able to disclose&#xD;
      their own HIV status to their primary school-aged children. The investigators also wish to&#xD;
      examine whether the intervention improves the quality of the maternal-child relationship,&#xD;
      emotional and well-being of the child and social support.&#xD;

      Research aim&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this clinical trial is to test the efficacy of an intervention which aims&#xD;
      to increase rates of maternal HIV disclosure to HIV-uninfected children aged 6-9 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims include to improve:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. health promotion and custody planning for mothers and their children;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. maternal and child mental health;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. family functioning and the quality of mother-child relationship;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that our intensive home-based intervention (the 'Amagugu' Counseling&#xD;
      Intervention), compared to the Standard of Care in clinic facilities, will significantly&#xD;
      increase rates of maternal HIV disclosure and will result in improvements in the quality of&#xD;
      the maternal-child relationship, emotional well-being of children and family support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention package was successfully piloted in late 2010 (Rochat et al 2013, BMC Public&#xD;
      Health) and a large scale feasibility and acceptability field test was completed with 281&#xD;
      families in April 2012 funded by the Canadian International Development Agency. Preliminary&#xD;
      results show that the intervention is highly acceptable, with more than 90% of mothers&#xD;
      agreeing to participate; and effective with more than 90% having disclosed to their child&#xD;
      either 'fully' (using the words 'HIV' and explaining that they have HIV) or 'partially'&#xD;
      (using the word 'virus' and explaining that they have this virus).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on our pilot work we have shown that at least 60% of mothers disclosed their HIV status&#xD;
      fully during the intervention. However, our results also show that prior disclosure to a&#xD;
      current partner at baseline significantly increases the odds of full disclosure to children&#xD;
      following the intervention. Since women enrolled in this trial will already be in HIV care&#xD;
      they are likely to have received counseling and support to disclose their HIV status to their&#xD;
      partners. To allow for the possibility of this effect in both intervention and control arms,&#xD;
      we have powered the study conservatively to ensure that we have adequate power to detect&#xD;
      differences between the groups. We have assumed that 30% women in the control arm will&#xD;
      disclose their HIV status to their children in this trial and that the intervention will&#xD;
      increase the proportion disclosing their HIV status to their children by at least 15&#xD;
      percentage points. Allowing for a loss-to-follow-up of 20%, 300 mothers in the intervention&#xD;
      arm and 300 in the control arm will provide &gt;90% power to detect a difference of 30% versus&#xD;
      45% (alpha type-one error of 5%, two-tailed) in HIV disclosure to children. This design will&#xD;
      also provide adequate power for our main secondary outcome which is children's social and&#xD;
      emotional wellbeing measured by the Child Behavior Checklist (Achenbach &amp; Ruffle, 2000) as&#xD;
      described in the objectives above. In high risk populations of children, one would expect the&#xD;
      mean CBCL total score to be 50 for boys and for girls, with a standard deviation of 10. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that our intervention would decrease the CBCL total difficulties score by at&#xD;
      least 3 points whilst there would be no change in the CBCL score in the control group. With&#xD;
      300 women in each group we would have &gt;90% power to detect a difference of 3 points between&#xD;
      control and intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research site&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed research will be managed from the Wellcome Trust-funded Africa Centre.&#xD;
      Recruitment will take place at a primary health care clinic located 1 km from the Africa&#xD;
      Centre headquarters. Participants will be enrolled from an established HIV Programme,&#xD;
      including (i) pre-ART patients who attend clinics on a 6-monthly basis to assess eligibility&#xD;
      for ART based on immunological (CD4 cell count) and clinical staging and (ii) patients&#xD;
      already on ART. Recruitment will be monitored carefully and if numbers are not sufficient we&#xD;
      will seek ethics permission to expand to additional clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment schedule&#xD;
&#xD;
      All 600 mothers (i.e. 300 in the intervention and 300 in the Standard of Care arms) will&#xD;
      receive assessments at four time points: at enrollment by the CRA and at home by one study&#xD;
      interviewer as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time point 1: Baseline assessment at enrollment at clinic (CRA) Time point 2: 3-month&#xD;
      assessment at home (study interviewer) Time point 3: 6-month assessment at home (study&#xD;
      interviewer) Time point 4: 9-month assessment at home (study interviewer)&#xD;
&#xD;
      All assessments will be conducted in isiZulu and the study interviewer will be blinded to&#xD;
      whether the mothers are randomized to the intervention or Standard of Care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection will be completed using mobile phones that will digitally capture and&#xD;
      transmit data from the field sites (clinic and women's homes) to the Africa Centre. Using the&#xD;
      key pad the research staff will load a mobile researcher application on the phone which will&#xD;
      display the questionnaires and assessments to be completed. On completion of the questions&#xD;
      and assessments, the answers will be stored securely on the handsets until the phone is in&#xD;
      the range of a mobile phone signal tower. There is a signal tower situated adjacent to the&#xD;
      Africa Centre, and signal strength in the area of the proposed research clinic is generally&#xD;
      excellent. When in range, the phones will automatically and securely upload the data to the&#xD;
      central database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whilst the main data capture method will be the mobile phones, paper forms will be used for&#xD;
      (i) informed consent, (ii) participant tracking information. These forms will be transported&#xD;
      weekly from the clinic to the Africa Centre and stored in a secure Data Centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Africa Centre has Standard Operating Procedures in place to track forms between the&#xD;
      field, clinics and Centre, with clear documentation to identify 'chains of custody' as forms&#xD;
      are handed between staff. In addition, a book containing a list of participating mothers and&#xD;
      their unique study ID will be kept in a locked cabinet in the clinic; this will only be&#xD;
      accessible by study staff. All files and data in the clinic are treated with the strictest of&#xD;
      confident. The two paper forms and this book will be the only places where an individual's&#xD;
      personal details are linked to their unique study ID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following uploading, data will be checked for completeness and accuracy the following day by&#xD;
      the study coordinator; with queries returned to the field staff within 48 hours for&#xD;
      correction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data cleaning will occur fortnightly, with routine checks for inaccuracies, outlying values&#xD;
      and missing data, with immediate feed-back to the field team for rectification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      An intention-to-treat analysis, based on the randomization, will be used for the primary&#xD;
      trial outcome - proportion of HIV-infected women who disclose to their HIV-uninfected child&#xD;
      at 3, 6 and 9-months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the possibility that the randomization may lead to some imbalance in the&#xD;
      distribution of risk factors across the trial arms, an assessment for baseline&#xD;
      characteristics known to be associated with disclosure will be undertaken using binary&#xD;
      logistic regression. These include age and gender of the child, mother's age, marital status&#xD;
      and family composition, mother's health status, and educational attainment that will be&#xD;
      collected as part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will report both adjusted and unadjusted effects of the intervention on disclosure. The&#xD;
      outcomes related to taking children on a health promotion visit to the clinic and developing&#xD;
      a clear custody care plan will be analyzed using the same methodology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Child Behavior Check List (CBCL) scale is a multi-axial, empirically-based measure for&#xD;
      assessing children's mental health and behavior by parent report. It consists of 120 items,&#xD;
      measuring eight constructs or syndromes ( Withdrawn, Somatic complaints, Anxious/Depressed,&#xD;
      Social Problems, Thought Problems, Attention Problems, Delinquent behavior, Aggressive&#xD;
      behavior) and allowing for examination of two broad grouping of syndromes: Internalizing and&#xD;
      Externalizing problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Raw scores can be converted to T scores to facilitate comparisons across the sub-scales,&#xD;
      computing a Total Internalizing, Externalizing and Competence Score as well as a Total score.&#xD;
      T scores from 50 to 70 are based on percentiles from normative samples of non- referred&#xD;
      children. For statistical analysis of syndrome scales in this research, raw scale scores will&#xD;
      be used and not T scores, in order to take account of the full range of variation in the&#xD;
      scales. Scores will be standardized taking age and gender into account.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CBCL has been cross-culturally validated, and translated for use in this research&#xD;
      community and was used as a measure in the preliminary work by the applicants. In line with&#xD;
      normative research we expect a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. The analysis to&#xD;
      compare changes in emotional and behavioral difficulties in children using the CBCL scale&#xD;
      will be performed on an intention-to-treat analysis. Baseline comparability across the trial&#xD;
      arms using the CBCL subscales will be assessed in subjects to address comparability by&#xD;
      randomization assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical significance of changes in total CBCL scores from baseline to 9-month&#xD;
      follow-up, within the control and intervention groups separately, will be calculated using t&#xD;
      tests for normally distributed outcome measures. If baseline disparities across treatment&#xD;
      arms are identified, then we will also perform linear regression analysis to allow adjustment&#xD;
      for baseline disparities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data safety and monitoring plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quality of data collection and management will be monitored throughout the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of mobile technology will result in several advantages in terms of data quality and&#xD;
      management including: built in algorithms and skip patterns to ensure data are collected with&#xD;
      accuracy, consistency and integrity; and 'real time' transmission of data collected in the&#xD;
      field to the Africa Centre Data Centre, ensuring rapid data cleaning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Data Safety and Monitoring Board has been established and the terms of reference agreed.&#xD;
