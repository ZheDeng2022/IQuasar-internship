    <description>As outlined above, multiple gel formulations of dapivirine have been developed for vaginal use.&#xD;
Three formulations, Dapivirine Gel-001 (Gel-001), Dapivirine Gel-002 (Gel-002), and Dapivirine Gel 4750 (Gel 4750) are no longer in development. Dapivirine Gel 4789, which has been tested in one clinical trial (IPM012), and Dapivirine Gel 4759 were recently evaluated in clinical trials, IPM 014A and IPM 020. This trial will use Dapivirine Gel 4759.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Dapivirine Film</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Dapivirine film is formulated in a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) based vaginal film containing hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) E5 (5 cp), polyethylene glycol 8000 (PEG), propylene glycol, and glycerin. PVA constituted 55.1% (w/w) of the film. The target loading dose for the film is 1.25 mg dapivirine per film based on phase I studies using dapivirine gels at concentrations of 0.01%, 0.02% and 0.05%30-33. The quantity of gel administered in these studies was 2.5 mL. Consequently the administered dose corresponds to 0.25, 0.5 and 1.25 mg dapivirine, respectively.</description>
