    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well pemetrexed disodium and carboplatin or&#xD;
      cisplatin with or without erlotinib hydrochloride work in treating patients with epidermal&#xD;
      growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutant positive stage IV non-small cell lung cancer and&#xD;
      acquired resistance to first-line therapy with erlotinib hydrochloride or gefitinib. In&#xD;
      patients that develop resistance to first-line therapy with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors&#xD;
      (TKIs) the drug is usually stopped and the patient is switched to chemotherapy. Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy, such as pemetrexed disodium, carboplatin, and cisplatin, work in different ways&#xD;
      to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from&#xD;
      dividing. Erlotinib hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the&#xD;
      enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet known whether pemetrexed disodium and&#xD;
      carboplatin or cisplatin is more effective with or without erlotinib hydrochloride in&#xD;
      treating patients with EGFR mutant non-small cell lung cancer and acquired resistance to EGFR&#xD;
      TKIs.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the effects of chemotherapy plus erlotinib (erlotinib hydrochloride) vs.&#xD;
      chemotherapy alone on progression-free survival (PFS) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)&#xD;
      patients harboring activating endothelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations who&#xD;
      developed acquired resistance to first-line therapy with erlotinib or gefitinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the overall survival (OS) and response rate in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the safety of erlotinib in combination with chemotherapy in this patient&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine whether presence of the T790M resistance mutation can be used to predict&#xD;
      which patients will benefit from the addition of erlotinib to chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine if patients with NSCLC harboring activating EGFR mutations who develop&#xD;
      acquired resistance to EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs) develop additional&#xD;
      mutations/genetic alterations on progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine whether any additional biomarkers (e.g., mesenchymal-epithelial transition&#xD;
      [MET] amplification, EGFR mutations detected in circulating free deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA])&#xD;
      predict response to second-line therapy in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine progression-free survival (PFS) in patients on the chemotherapy alone arm&#xD;
      who crossed over to erlotinib after progression as compared to patients on the combination&#xD;
      chemotherapy arm (erlotinib plus chemotherapy) who switched to chemotherapy of choice&#xD;
      (without erlotinib) after progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21,&#xD;
      pemetrexed disodium intravenously (IV) and carboplatin IV or cisplatin IV on day 1. Treatment&#xD;
      repeats every 21 days for 4 courses. Patients then receive maintenance erlotinib&#xD;
      hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 and pemetrexed disodium IV on day 1.&#xD;
      Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive pemetrexed disodium and carboplatin or cisplatin as in Arm I.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses. Patients then receive maintenance pemetrexed&#xD;
      disodium as in Arm I. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed until death.&#xD;
