      The hypothesis tested if the diffusion properties in the base line, such as mean diffusivity&#xD;
      or kurtosis, can differentiate two subtypes of MCI and predict the clinical outcome in&#xD;
      Patients. The hypothesis further supports the correlation of the measured diffusion&#xD;
      properties and the disease severity. We therefore proposed to investigate the potential value&#xD;
      of diffusion properties as a possible tool to monitor the disease progression. The disease&#xD;
      related changes in neural connectivity will be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The diffusion MRI could provide an improved diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease and Mild&#xD;
           cognitive Impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Explanation:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The deposition of the macromolecules such as beta amyloid in the brain and the&#xD;
           associated neuron death of the patient could lead to observable changes in tissue&#xD;
           microenvironment. The related changes would lead to alterations in either the amplitude&#xD;
           or distribution of water diffusion. In turn it could be detected in diffusion tensor and&#xD;
           kurtosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. aMCI is a preclinical state of AD and dMCI is from a different etiology, which can be&#xD;
           differentially diagnosis by MRI. Diffusion Imaging could help to predict the clinical&#xD;
           outcome Explanation&#xD;

      Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) referred to a decline of cognition in elder adults that are&#xD;
      not of sufficient magnitude to meet the criteria for dementia. It is usually regarded as a&#xD;
      transition state between patients of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and the age matched healthy&#xD;
      adults. It is a heterogeneous syndrome which can be divided into two subtypes: amnestic and&#xD;
      dysexecutive. This 3 year proposal continues from a NSc funded project, in which we reported&#xD;
      that the amnestic MCI could involve global white matter changes and therefore could be a&#xD;
      preclinical status to AD. In contrast, no compromise in white matter status was found in&#xD;
      patients of dysexecutive MCI. Therefore we proposed to further investigate the phenomena in&#xD;
      this project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be divided into 3 groups: 30 patients with amnestic MCI, 30 with&#xD;
      dysexecutive MCI and 30 healthy age-matched normal controls. Comprehensive neuropsychological&#xD;
      examinations will be performed after detailed clinical history and physical screening,&#xD;
      including Mini-Mental Status Examination, Clinical Dementia Rating and the Cognitive&#xD;
      Abilities Screening Instrument. Successful candidate will be examined by 3T MRI, including&#xD;
      diffusion imaging and high resolution T1 weighted anatomical images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current project proposed to examine the sensitivity and specificity of diffusion Magnetic&#xD;
      Resonance Imaging, in the diagnosis of MCI and differential diagnosis of two subtypes. Both&#xD;
      the conventional tensor derived indices and diffusion kurtosis will be compared. This is due&#xD;
      to the fact that in a recently publication in Radiology, we reported an improved diagnostic&#xD;
      performance on neurodegenerative disease from diffusion kurtosis than diffusion tensor.&#xD;
      Secondly we will examine the regional changes of diffusion properties and correlated with the&#xD;
      white matter involvement in patients. High resolution track density images will be&#xD;
      implemented and compared with the susceptibility weighted imaging in an effort to address the&#xD;
      underlying changes in pathophysiology. In the third year, the prognostic value of diffusion&#xD;
      MRI will be determined. The optimal cutoff value of diffusion MRI in the prediction of&#xD;
      conversion to Alzheimer's disease will be reported. The diffusion properties in patients with&#xD;
      early conversion (the 2nd year) and late conversion (the 3rd year) will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that changes in diffusion can be used as an image based surrogate marker&#xD;
      during the neurodegenerative process. The new insight into the temporal evolution of the&#xD;
      diffusion MRI might help to understand the underlying etiology and pathophysiology between&#xD;
      the amnestic and dysexecutive MCI patients, which can contribute to an early intervention&#xD;
      strategy and might ultimately lead to an effective treatment.&#xD;
