    <textblock>
      In a small study at Johns Hopkins, women were treated with partial breast irradiation and&#xD;
      chemotherapy given at the same time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are now testing in a bigger study whether giving partial breast irradiation and&#xD;
      chemotherapy at the same time (our new method) has the same side effects and outcomes as&#xD;
      giving partial breast irradiation and chemotherapy at different times(older method). In this&#xD;
      study women who had their breast cancer removed but need radiation to the breast will be&#xD;
      randomized to partial breast irradiation at the same time as chemotherapy or partial breast&#xD;
      radiation at a different time than chemotherapy. Randomization is like flipping a coin but in&#xD;
      this study about 2 of every 3 women will get the new method.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Breast conserving therapy (BCT) defined as lumpectomy and adjuvant whole breast irradiation&#xD;
      (WBI) is integral to the treatment of early stage breast cancer (ESBC). In these patients,&#xD;
      BCT provides equivalent survival to mastectomy. Despite equivalent survival, many patients&#xD;
      still choose mastectomy over the BCT in light of the 5-7 week commitment required for&#xD;
      radiation therapy (XRT). Partial breast irradiation, however, has provided women with ESBC an&#xD;
      alternative option for XRT. Worth noting, is PBI offers several advantages over WBI&#xD;
      including; decreased duration of XRT, and reduced radiation dose delivery to normal breast&#xD;
      tissue and surrounding organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several large trials have advanced the adoption of PBI as a treatment option for women with&#xD;
      ESBC. Results of these trials unfortunately differ in regards to patient outcomes. Some&#xD;
      trials report no significant difference in the local failure rate (LFR) between&#xD;
      intraoperative radiation therapy, interstitial brachytherapy and standard WBI following&#xD;
      lumpectomy (Vaidya et al. Lancet 2010; Polgar et al. IJROBP 2004). While others, have&#xD;
      demonstrated similar outcomes for PBI and WBI only apply to a select group of patients. (Khan&#xD;
      et al. International Journal of Radiation Oncology *Biology *Physics (IJROBP) 2012;&#xD;
      Shaitelman et al. Cancer 2010; Stull et al. ASTRO 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A growing body of evidence now suggests, that there is in fact a subgroup of patients for&#xD;
      which PBI may not be appropriate. In particular, patients with estrogen receptor (ER)&#xD;
      negative tumors have been observed to have higher LFR than patients with ER positive tumors.&#xD;
      Stull et al. reported a 3-year LFR of 2% and 12% in ER positive (n=149) and ER negative&#xD;
      (n=17) tumors, respectively (Stull et al. ASO 2012). Additionally, Shaitelman et al. reviewed&#xD;
      patients treated on the Mammosite registry and found the hazard ratio for local failure was&#xD;
      4.01 in women with ER negative compared to ER positive disease (n=991). (Shaitelman et al.&#xD;
      Cancer 2010)&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address the variation in patient outcomes for women treated with PBI, American Society for&#xD;
      Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) published a consensus statement grouping patients into &quot;suitable,&quot;&#xD;
      &quot;cautionary,&quot; or &quot;unsuitable&quot; categories. These groupings sought to identify populations best&#xD;
      suited for PBI. Patients with ER negative breast cancer were assigned to either the&#xD;
      cautionary or unsuitable categories. Shah et al. published a pooled analysis (n=1978) that&#xD;
      found the only significant factor associated with ipsilateral breast recurrence (IBRT ) in&#xD;
      women who received PBI was ER status. (Shah et al. IJROBP 2012). Leonardi et al. reported&#xD;
      similar findings; local recurrence was 2.68 (p = 0.0003) more likely in ER negative (n=189)&#xD;
      than in ER positive (n=1608) breast cancers (Leonardi et al. IJROBP 2012). These results&#xD;
      suggest that perhaps, patients with ER negative disease are not the most appropriate patients&#xD;
      to be treated with PBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to radiation therapy, patients are often treated with chemotherapy. Chemotherapy&#xD;
      has traditionally been administered either before or after PBI. There are potentially&#xD;
      significant benefits, however, that can be gained by the simultaneous administration of&#xD;
      chemotherapy and PBI. Administrations of radiation with concurrent chemotherapy soon after&#xD;
      surgery will not only shorten the overall duration of therapy, but has the potential to&#xD;
      capitalize on the synergy between the two treatment modalities and improve local control.&#xD;
      Reports of prohibitive toxicity with concurrent administration of anthracycline-based&#xD;
      chemotherapy with WBI have made this approach unpopular. The smaller fields employed during&#xD;
      PBI may provide an alternative option. PBI has the potential to reduce toxicity and&#xD;
      accelerate the radiation treatment schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, we have been able to conduct two phase I trials of PBI and concurrent chemotherapy&#xD;
      (PBICC). In both trials we tested whether the toxicity remained prohibitive with this&#xD;
      combined treatment regimen. In the first trial, 25 patients were treated with PBI and&#xD;
      concurrent dose dense doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. In the second trial, 34 patients were&#xD;
      treated similarly but selection of the chemotherapy regimen was at the discretion of the&#xD;
      treating medical oncologist. Results from both trials revealed that PBICC well appears to be&#xD;
      tolerated. Specifically, there was no grade 3 or 4 acute or late radiation induced toxicity&#xD;
      in either trial. Although these trials were not powered for local failure, one significant&#xD;
      finding from these trials was there were no local failures in the first trial (median follow&#xD;
      up 6 years), and only one failure (low grade DCIS) in the second trial (median follow up 2.5&#xD;
      years). Interestingly, there were no recurrences in the 21 patients with ER negative tumors&#xD;
      or the 17 patients with triple negative tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our center is the only center to have investigated and published phase I trials of PBICC.&#xD;
      Through these trials we have demonstrated preliminary information that PBICC is safe,&#xD;
      feasible, and effective treatment option for women with ESBC. Based on our unique experience,&#xD;
      we hypothesize that women with ER negative ESBC treated with PBICC will have local control&#xD;
      rates similar to women with ER positive disease. Additionally, we hypothesize that women&#xD;
      placed in the prone position will have an even more favorable toxicity profile than women&#xD;
      placed in the supine position for both PBI and WBI. To further substantiate the low toxicity&#xD;
      associated with PBICC and to test this our improved local control hypothesis, we will conduct&#xD;
      a randomized prospective trial of PBI with concurrent vs. sequential chemotherapy in women&#xD;
      with ER negative or positive ESBC. Our primary endpoint is acute grade 3-4 radiation toxicity&#xD;
      and our secondary endpoints will be local control and breast specific quality of life&#xD;
