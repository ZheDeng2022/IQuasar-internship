    <textblock>
      Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is a process of both immune and non-immune mediated&#xD;
      thickening of the heart arteries of transplanted hearts. CAV limits the long term survival of&#xD;
      heart transplant patients and is one of the common causes of death in the late post&#xD;
      transplant period. Current methods of detecting CAV rest with invasive cardiac&#xD;
      catheterization which carry repeated risks, as this test needs to be performed periodically&#xD;
      through the life of a heart transplant patient. Traditional methods of coronary angiography&#xD;
      identify CAV late in its course and is a crude method of evaluating coronary anatomy in heart&#xD;
      transplant patients. Intravascular ultrasound is an additive tool that is able to detect&#xD;
      early CAV before it becomes angiographically apparent, but still requires invasive cardiac&#xD;
      catheterization to perform. However, it also limits assessment to the major epicardial&#xD;
      arteries and does not give any information regarding the smaller branch vessels and cardiac&#xD;
      microvasculature. Advances in cardiac CT and cardiac MRI hold potential to evaluate for CAV&#xD;
      non-invasively. In addition, perfusion techniques may provide additional functional&#xD;
      information regarding the status of the microvascular.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this pilot study, we aim to demonstrate the feasibility of cardiac CT and cardiac MRI with&#xD;
      and without perfusion protocols, in patients post-heart transplant and to describe and&#xD;
      compare CT and MRI findings in patients with established CAV versus those with no CAV, as&#xD;
      diagnosed by standard invasive methods.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart transplantation is a viable treatment option for select patients with end-stage heart&#xD;
      failure, with 1-year survival rates for heart transplantation approximating 85%. Of those who&#xD;
      survive the first year, &gt;90% are alive at 5 years. In the early post-transplant period,&#xD;
      rejection of the donor heart due to activation of the recipients immune system, is the most&#xD;
      worrisome complication and most common cause of morbidity and mortality. With time, the risk&#xD;
      of rejection declines and cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) represents the most common&#xD;
      cause of heart failure and death in heart transplant recipients. CAV is a form of coronary&#xD;
      artery disease in the transplanted heart. It develops due to a variety of immune and&#xD;
      non-immune mediated mechanisms. It differs significantly from coronary artery disease in&#xD;
      normal hearts, in that it affects arteries of all sizes (not just the main arteries visible&#xD;
      by coronary angiography) and it involves thickening of the inner layer of the arteries,&#xD;
      rather than the surface lining of the arteries as in traditional coronary artery disease.&#xD;
      Early CAV is clinically silent. Patients are most often diagnosed by routine coronary&#xD;
      angiographic surveillance (standard of care), or by declining heart function by surveillance&#xD;
      imaging (standard of care), with no evidence of any organ rejection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronary angiography and assessment of heart function remain the cornerstone for diagnosis of&#xD;
      CAV. The main limitation of angiography is its inability to identify mild or early disease,&#xD;
      as an apparently normal angiogram can underestimate the presence of CAV. Intra-vascular&#xD;
      ultrasound (IVUS) at coronary angiography has been evaluted as an adjunctive mordality for&#xD;
      assessing and diagnosing early CAV. Certain IVUS parameters have been correlated with high&#xD;
      risk for development of CAV and overall worse prognosis long term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detection of CAV has important therapeutic and prognostic implications. Once detected by&#xD;
      angiography, the likelihood of progression to severe CAV within 5 years is 19%. The overall&#xD;
      likelihood of death or re-transplantation as a result of CAV is approximately 50% for severe&#xD;
      CAV. Changes are made to medical therapy targeted at slowing or halting CAV progression and&#xD;
      patients are evaluated for re-transplantation sooner rather than later, depending on the rate&#xD;
      of progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, CAV is diagnosed by cardiac catheterization performed at routine intervals post&#xD;
      transplant, with or without the use of IVUS. This is an invasive test with complications&#xD;
      including bleeding, vascular damage, renal failure, stroke, heart attack or death. It has low&#xD;
      sensitivity for identifying early CAV. Recent advances in cardiac magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (CMR) and cardiac CT imaging (CCT) present a unique opportunity to investigate these&#xD;
      non-invasive modalities in CAV. To date, there are no studies in this field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to evaluate whether functional CCT and/or CMR perfusion abnormalities, calcium&#xD;
      scoring by CCT, and late gadolinium enhancement by CMR, is feasible in heart transplant&#xD;
      patients and whether these modalities can detect abnormalities that correlate to cardiac&#xD;
      catheterization results and detect early CAV before it becomes angiographically apparent.&#xD;
      This pilot study will be the first of its kind in the heart transplant population. We aim to&#xD;
      demonstrate feasibility and safety of CCT/CMR in heart transplant patients and correlate&#xD;
      specific CMR/CCT abnormalities to established angiographic apparent CAV. This will allow&#xD;
      further prospective evaluation of this exciting non-invasive modality in CAV detection with&#xD;
      larger research studies by our group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical implications are significant in that we may reduce the number of invasive&#xD;
      procedures performed and identify CAV earlier, leading to the institution of earlier&#xD;
      therapies, such as proliferation signal inhibitors, that may alter the natural history of&#xD;
      this disease in effort to prolong the life of the transplanted heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The number of patients with adverse events from CCT and CMR&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine recruitment rates for future studies, logistics of testing, and the ability to&#xD;
           perform the tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Describe the CCT and CMR imaging findings in CAV&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Identify and describe structural and functional CMR abnormalities in established&#xD;
                angiographically apparent CAV using novel imaging protocols, including stress-rest&#xD;
                perfusion imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Identify and describe structural and functional cardiac CT abnormalities in&#xD;
                established angiographically apparent CAV using novel imaging protocols, including&#xD;
                stress-rest perfusion imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Correlation between intimal thickening by IVUS imaging at cardiac catheterization and&#xD;
           CCT/CMR perfusion abnormalities at one year post heart transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Correlation between CCT/CMR perfusion abnormalities at one year post heart transplant&#xD;
           with the development of angiographically apparent CAV, graft dysfunction, cardiac&#xD;
           adverse events, and overall survival long term, and compare CCT to CMR in this regard&#xD;
           (Cohort 1 &amp; 2 below)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Patients will be recruited into 1 of 3 cohorts from the heart transplant&#xD;
      program at the QE II Health Science Center, Halifax Infirmary site, using a protocol approved&#xD;
      by the institutional research ethics board. Eligible patients are those scheduled for routine&#xD;
      invasive coronary angiography, &gt; 18 years of age, &gt; 12 months post-transplant and be able to&#xD;
      undergo both CCT and CMR. Exclusion criteria include a creatinine clearance (CrCl) calculated&#xD;
      &lt; 45ml/min, contraindications or inability to administer intravenous beta-blockers or calcium&#xD;
      channel blockers and standard contraindications to CMR, contrast media, and adenosine.&#xD;
      Patients will be identified by Dr. Brian Clarke who is involved the care of all heart&#xD;
      transplant patients at the QE II Health Science Centre&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Feasibility will be determined based on successful rate of recruitment and completion of&#xD;
           CCT/CMR scans in cohort 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients eligible for cohort 3 require the diagnosis of CAV 1 at any time point&#xD;
           post-transplant. The attending transplant cardiologist involved makes this assessment.&#xD;
           More advanced CAV is excluded. These patients will be analyzed without a comparator&#xD;
           group. For CCT, calcium scoring, intimal thickening, and perfusion abnormalities will be&#xD;
           described and analyzed for their correlation to angiographic findings. CMR imaging will&#xD;
           describe late gadolinium enhancement, structural changes, and perfusion abnormalities&#xD;
           and be analyzed for their correlation to angiographic findings. In a separate analysis,&#xD;
           these patients will also be compared with those in cohort 2 to determine the&#xD;
           non-invasive imaging differences between CAV1 and CAV0 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Cohort 1 will be analyzed separately; comparing those with MIT &lt;0.5mm to those with MIT&#xD;
           &gt; 0.5mm for differences in CCT/CMR imaging and perfusion abnormalities. CCT will be&#xD;
           compared with CMR in both MIT subgroups. We anticipate to identify perfusion&#xD;
           abnormalities in the MIT &gt; 0.5mm group and no perfusion abnormalities in the MIT &lt;&#xD;
           0.5mm. Patients in cohort 1 will be followed long term for the development of&#xD;
           angiographically apparent CAV, adverse cardiac events, graft dysfunction, and death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results will be reported mainly in a descriptive manner, so that data will be summarized in&#xD;
      percentage, mean or median, where applicable.&#xD;
