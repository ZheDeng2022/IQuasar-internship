    <textblock>
      Colorectal Surgery Preoperative Exercise Training is a study being run by the colorectal&#xD;
      surgery team at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital and the University of East Anglia&#xD;
      to look at the role of exercise before surgery to improve recovery following an operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Having an operation to remove part of the bowel puts physical stress on the body. We know&#xD;
      that training can help the body cope with physical stress in the same way that an athlete&#xD;
      trains before a competition. We hypothesise that the body may recover more quickly if it is&#xD;
      trained prior to an operation with regular and simple exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) is used to evaluate the function of the lungs, heart&#xD;
      and muscles at rest and during exercise. CPET testing is often done as part of standard&#xD;
      pre-operative assessment in many hospitals for patients before undergoing major surgery. Some&#xD;
      studies have demonstrated that CPET can be used to predict outcomes following surgery (such&#xD;
      as time taken till discharge, complication rates).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of two parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 1) CPET variables to predict outcomes in surgery - patients will undergo a CPET test to&#xD;
      determine baseline fitness. Blood tests will be taken around the time of surgery to examine&#xD;
      whether biochemical markers in the bloodstream (when used in combination with results from&#xD;
      the CPET test) can predict outcomes and recovery following colorectal surgery. Patients will&#xD;
      then be monitored to assess their speed of recovery and rate of complications following&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will enable us to determine which CPET variables or combination of variables are most&#xD;
      useful in the prediction of post-operative complications following colorectal surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2) The second study will consist of an exercise intervention involving several sessions of&#xD;
      supervised exercise in a laboratory. Before and at the end the exercise training regime, CPET&#xD;
      measurements will be taken to see if fitness has improved with exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This part of of the study is to determine if it is feasible to implement a structured,&#xD;
      supervised exercise programme for patients awaiting elective colorectal cancer surgery. The&#xD;
      results of this study will be used to inform a larger randomised controlled trial to examine&#xD;
      the influence of exercise on CPET variables and postoperative outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in two parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1. Study to examine the ability of CPET to predict outcomes in patients undergoing&#xD;
      colorectal surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify which CPET variables or combination of variables are most useful in the&#xD;
      prediction of post-operative complications following colorectal surgery. In addition, to&#xD;
      examine whether CPET variables can be used in combination with other scoring systems or blood&#xD;
      tests to increase accuracy of prediction. The aim of this investigation is to develop an&#xD;
      accurate prediction model from key clinically relevant predictor variables, including CPET&#xD;
      variables, blood tests and risk scoring systems. Such a model could be used in clinical&#xD;
      practice to predict pre-operative outcome and thus help risk stratify patients for&#xD;
      post-operative surveillance or management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital undertakes approximately 300 procedures for&#xD;
      colorectal cancers per year. Patients scheduled for cancer surgery will be recruited to the&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Outline&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent to participate in the trial will be obtained in the outpatient setting after&#xD;
      diagnosis/scheduling of surgery through discussion with the medical team and the colorectal&#xD;
      nurse specialists. All patients will follow a standardised peri-operative pathway devised in&#xD;
      conjunction with the surgical and anaesthetic team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size of a minimum of 90 patients has been identified, based on comparable studies&#xD;
      with other patient groups in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Predictor Variables&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supervised pre-operative CPET testing will take place in the exercise laboratory at the&#xD;
      University of East Anglia before surgery. The test is done by pedalling on a stationary&#xD;
      bicycle, the resistance to pedalling will gradually increase, similar to when cycling up a&#xD;
      hill. As the subject rides the stationary bike, the amount of oxygen used, and how&#xD;
      fast/efficiently their heart beats is calculated. Breathing will be measured through a face&#xD;
      mask or a mouth piece and the electrical activity of the heart will be measured via sensors&#xD;
      placed on the chest. Each CPET test takes around 30 minutes to complete. For each participant&#xD;
      in this part of the study, only one CPET test will be done prior to surgery at a convenient&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the standard pre-surgery blood tests that all NHS patients receive, blood will&#xD;
      be taken to measure several key serum markers which have been associated with post-operative&#xD;
      outcomes in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery (pro-BNP, CRP, albumin and IL-6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scoring systems will be applied to patient data as additional indicators of peri-operative&#xD;
      risk - these are systems which involve calculating a measure of risk based on other&#xD;
      co-existing illnesses the patient may have.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient notes will be reviewed on each postoperative day to identify postoperative&#xD;
      complications according to the Post-Operative Morbidity Survey system (POMS), this is a&#xD;
      scoring tool previously used in other studies which assesses different systems of the body to&#xD;
      determine 'morbidity' according to defined criteria (pulmonary, infection, renal,&#xD;
      gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, wound complications, haematological and pain. Time taken&#xD;
      until pain relief is satisfactory, ability to eat and drink, satisfactory level of&#xD;
      mobility/self-care and bowel function will also be recorded. Length of hospital stay and time&#xD;
      taken until the patient is medically fit for discharge will also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: Feasibility of a randomised prehabilitation programme in patients undergoing surgery&#xD;
      for colorectal cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the feasibility of implementing a structured, supervised exercise programme for&#xD;
      patients awaiting elective colorectal cancer surgery. The results of this study will be used&#xD;
      to inform a larger randomised controlled trial to examine the influence of exercise on CPET&#xD;
      variables and postoperative outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population (as above)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Outline&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following baseline CPET testing to assess initial background fitness, patients will be&#xD;
      randomised to one of two study arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. a supervised aerobic exercise training pathway + standard treatment or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. standard treatment without supervised exercise training&#xD;
&#xD;
      To adequately assess key feasibility outcomes, a sample size of 60 patients (30 in each arm&#xD;
      of the study) will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomised to exercise training will be offered three sessions of supervised aerobic&#xD;
      exercise per week over the subsequent 4 weeks before their procedure to be conducted in the&#xD;
      exercise lab at the University of East Anglia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each session will include a few simple freehand exercises as well as some time on the&#xD;
      treadmill or a fixed exercise bike. The sessions will last about an hour each and will be&#xD;
      tailored to individual fitness levels. Heart rate, clinical signs, blood pressure and&#xD;
      perceived exertion will be recorded regularly throughout exercise. This exercise protocol is&#xD;
      currently in use in a study of elderly patients with bladder cancer awaiting surgery and is&#xD;
      well-tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repeat CPET testing will then take place 4 weeks from the baseline test in the exercise&#xD;
      laboratory (on the day prior to surgery) to determine changes (if any) in CPET variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients in the non-exercise arm of the study will not undergo any exercise intervention&#xD;
      but will be CPET tested in the exercise laboratory at the same time points as the exercise&#xD;
      arm patients. The data from these patients (n=30) will be used to contribute to the first&#xD;
      part of the study (CPET variables as predictors of outcome).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be CPET tested again at 3 months post-surgery to assess how well they have&#xD;
      returned to their baseline function following their operation. Patients will be given&#xD;
      follow-up questionnaires at this time, and again at 6 months post-surgery to assess&#xD;
      health-related quality of life and psychological outcomes. The questionnaires used will be:&#xD;
      CHAMPS Physical Activity Questionnaire for older adults, The Satisfaction with Life Scale,&#xD;
      Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), FACT-F and the FACT-C scale to assess&#xD;
      disease-specific quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As before, patient notes will be reviewed and post-operative complications identified. In&#xD;
      addition, this study will assess the feasibility of conducting this trial on a larger scale:&#xD;
      to identify the number of eligible patients, recruitment rate, willingness of patients to be&#xD;
      randomised, willingness of clinicians to participate in the trial, compliance/tolerance of&#xD;
      the exercise regimen, and patient satisfaction with the process. In addition, the costs of&#xD;
      undergoing CPET testing and supervised exercise training will be estimated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An assessment of key health outcomes will also be undertaken, i.e. changes in CPET variables&#xD;
      following exercise training, postoperative complications, length of stay, and health-related&#xD;
      quality of life benefits, thus enabling the planning of a larger trial.&#xD;
