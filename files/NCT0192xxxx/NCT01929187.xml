  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Onychomycosis, the most common nail disorder, is a superficial fungal infection&#xD;
      affecting toenails more than fingernails. Onychomycosis can cause pain and discomfort and has&#xD;
      the potential to be a source of morbidity. Although oral antifungal agents achieve a better&#xD;
      complete cure rate for onychomycosis, many patients are worried about the side effects and&#xD;
      unwilling to take oral medications. Phytonail is a mixture of herbal active ingredients&#xD;
      including tea tree oil, lavender oil and Australian blue cypress oil with BioEqual carrier&#xD;
      system. A preliminary trial has shown a 100% KOH negative rate in 32 nails after 12 weeks of&#xD;
      Phytonail therapy. Amorolfine 5% nail lacquer (Loceryl) is a broad-spectrum morpholine&#xD;
      antifungal demonstrated 60-75% mycological cure rate in several randomized controlled trials&#xD;
      for the treatment of toenail onychomycosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Phytonail relative to amorolfine 5% nail&#xD;
      lacquer in the treatment of toenail onychomycosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This is a randomized, parallel-group, open-labeled study in adult subjects with&#xD;
      toenail onychomycosis. In this study, 60 eligible patients will be randomized in a 1: 1 ratio&#xD;
      to one of the two treatment groups: Phytonail or amorolfine 5% nail lacquer. Before&#xD;
      randomization, patients are to have onychomycosis in at least one great toenail with positive&#xD;
      KOH examination and positive fungal culture. During the treatment phase, Phytonail will be&#xD;
      applied twice daily and amorolfine 5% nail lacquer once weekly for 16 weeks to all affected&#xD;
      toenails. Physician's assessments and photographic analyses will be carried out at baseline,&#xD;
      Week 4, 8, 16, and 24. Mycological evaluation including KOH examination will be performed at&#xD;
      baseline, Week 4, 8, and 16. Fungal culture will be performed at baseline and for KOH&#xD;
      negative patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects aged 20-65 years with toenail onychomychosis involved at least one great toenail&#xD;
      will be recruited in the study. Approximately 200 subjects will be screened, in order to&#xD;
      randomize 72 eligible subjects. Allowing for approximately 20% drop-outs, it is estimated&#xD;
      that for completing 60 eligible subjects, approximately 72 subjects would be enrolled.&#xD;
      Subjects must meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria to receive&#xD;
      treatment assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Explain study and obtain written informed consent: Screening Review inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
      criteria including prior and concomitant medications: Screening and Baseline (Day 1)&#xD;
      Demographics: Screening Medical history (including prior onychomycosis): Screening Personal&#xD;
      and family history as well as history of any prior treatment for onychomycosis and any&#xD;
      symptoms attributed to onychomycosis Physical examination: Screening Selection of target&#xD;
      great toenail: Screening Proper nail trimming of target great toenail (as needed): all visits&#xD;
      The subject's target great toenail will be properly trimmed as needed by the investigator or&#xD;
      a qualified designee. Proper nail trimming is defined as cutting the nail plate to within 1&#xD;
      mm of the hyponychium or distal groove. In case of onycholysis the nail is to be trimmed not&#xD;
      to the proximal limit of the onycholysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Percentage of nail involvement of the target great toenail based on signs of onychomycosis:&#xD;
      all visits The percentage of involvement of the target great toenail will be determined by&#xD;
      the investigator's visual estimate of the extent of the total nail area that shows signs of&#xD;
      onychomycosis after proper trimming the nail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of other toenails: all visits (except screening) At baseline (Day 1) and all&#xD;
      subsequent visits, the investigator will identify all other toenails (excluding the target&#xD;
      great toenail) with signs of onychomycosis and determine the total number of toenails that&#xD;
      are completely clear (0% involvement) or almost clear (&lt;10% involvement).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Marking the target great toenail: all visits The investigator will ink the distal groove, the&#xD;
      2-mm notch (except at Screening, when the notch will not have been made yet), and the&#xD;
      healthy/involved limit of the target toenail with a supplied indelible marking pen. These&#xD;
      markings on the target great toenail will be used to determine the CN, and will be used for&#xD;
      the calculation of CNG and LNG. The initial photo of the unmarked nail must be taken before&#xD;
      any marking is made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two-millimeter notch for the target great toenail: Baseline (Day 1) At the Baseline (Day 1)&#xD;
      visit, the investigator will make a superficial notch in the nail plate, approximately 2 mm&#xD;
      distal from the proximal nail fold. The investigator will ink the notch with a marking pen at&#xD;
      this and each subsequent visit. If, as the nail grows, the investigator feels that the&#xD;
      original notch may be clipped off at the next visit, a new nail notch approximately 2 mm from&#xD;
      the proximal nail fold will be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      KOH examination of the target great toenail: Screening, Week 4, 8, and 16. Fungal culture of&#xD;
      the target great toenail: Screening, at Week 4, 8, and 16 only for KOH negative patients&#xD;
      Digital photography: Baseline (Day 1); Week 4, 8, 16, and 24; early termination (if&#xD;
      applicable)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Digital photographs will be analyzed for the following measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clear nail (CN) of the target great toenail: CN is defined as the distance (mm) between the&#xD;
      PNF and the most proximal limit of the disease (as marked by the investigator).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clear nail growth (CNG) of the target great toenail: The CNG is a calculation and is defined&#xD;
      as the difference (mm) between the CN at a given visit and the CN at Baseline (Day 1). For&#xD;
      example, if the baseline CN is 2 mm and the Week 12 CN is 5 mm, the nail will have 3 mm of&#xD;
      new clear nail growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Linear nail growth (LNG) of the target great toenail: The LNG represents the growth of nail&#xD;
      plate (normal and mycotic) over a period of time. LNG is defined as the distance at any given&#xD;
      time point from the PNF to the nail notch, minus the distance of the notch from the PNF at&#xD;
      Baseline (2 mm). For example, if at a post-Baseline visit the length from the proximal nail&#xD;
      fold to the inked notch becomes 6 mm, then the nail will have growth 4 mm (6 mm- 2 mm= 4 mm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: Baseline (Day 1) Subject dosing diary dispensing: Baseline (Day 1) through&#xD;
      Week 8 Subject dosing diary collection: Week 4 through Week 16, and early termination Study&#xD;
      drug dispensing: Baseline (Day 1) through Week 8 Study drug self-administration: Baseline&#xD;
      (Day 1) through Week 16 Study drug collection: Week 4 through Week 16, and early termination&#xD;
      Prior and concomitant drugs: All visits Record adverse events: All visits (except screening)&#xD;
