  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Benign biliary strictures caused by chronic pancreatitis can be endoscopically treated with&#xD;
      covered self-expandable metal stents (cSEMS).The purpose of the prospective randomized study&#xD;
      is to define the optimal duration of stenting and the diameter of the cSEMS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All consecutive patients admitted for ERCP and treated for benign biliary stricture caused by&#xD;
      chronic pancreatitis with or without acute pancreatitis are prospectively enrolled in the&#xD;
      study. The age and gender of the patients and the aetiology of the pancreatitis will be&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At initial presentation, clinical and laboratory findings recorded include liver function&#xD;
      tests, abdominal pain, jaundice and cholangitis. Pancreatic calcifications are documented in&#xD;
      abdominal computed tomography. Patients with malignancies, cirrhosis, acute/chronic hepatitis&#xD;
      or abnormal hepatic imaging studies are excluded. Patients with first attack of acute&#xD;
      pancreatitis will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The approval of the ethics committee of the hospital has been obtained. An informed consent&#xD;
      will be obtained from all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients are prepared and sedated for ERCP as per standard medical practice of the&#xD;
      hospital. At the initial ERCP, an endoscopic sphincterotomy will be performed and the&#xD;
      presence/absence of bile duct stones above the stricture and the treatment of stones are&#xD;
      recorded. A pancreatic stent will be inserted if indicated. For the initial ERCP the patients&#xD;
      will be randomized into two groups: those who receive 10 mm diameter cSEMS and those who&#xD;
      receive 12 mm diameter cSEMS into the bile duct. For the randomization, sealed envelopes will&#xD;
      be used. The length of the cSEMS is recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further ERCP for stent removal will be performed after six months for the patients with 12 mm&#xD;
      diameter cSEMS and after twelve months for the patients with 10 mm diameter cSEMS. In case of&#xD;
      stent migration during the follow-up, the stent will be replaced by a similar new cSEMS. If a&#xD;
      pancreatic stent will be placed, the removal or replacement will be handled according to the&#xD;
      hospital practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After each ERCP procedure, all patients will stay in hospital for monitoring the occurrence&#xD;
      of primary complications such as acute pancreatitis and cholangitis, bile leak, bleeding or&#xD;
      perforation. Plasma amylase activity is measured same day &gt; 4h after ERCP. Post-ERCP&#xD;
      pancreatitis is defined as the presence of abdominal pain attributable to acute pancreatitis&#xD;
      and plasma amylase level at least three times above the upper limit of the reference&#xD;
      interval. The treatment of primary complications is recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical response (adequate biliary drainage) and recurrent stricture formation are the&#xD;
      primary endpoints of the study. Therefore, blood liver function tests (bilirubin, alkaline&#xD;
      phosphatase) as well as the minimum diameter of the common bile duct in the area of the&#xD;
      stricture, the maximum diameter of the common bile duct above the stricture and the length of&#xD;
      the stricture are measured at ERCPs at the time of the initial ERCP and at removal of cSEMS.&#xD;
      Blood liver function tests are measured in the morning before ERCPs; the exact widths and&#xD;
      lengths in mm:s are obtained by comparison the widths and lengths with the diameter of the&#xD;
      scope. In addition, blood liver function tests are measured and abdominal ultrasonography&#xD;
      performed in the follow-up six months and two years after the stent removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Morbidity and mortality are additional endpoints of the study. Therefore, complications&#xD;
      (deaths, stent occlusions, dislodgements or migrations, cholangitis, hemobilia, stone&#xD;
      formation above the stent), management of complications, admission times, surgical&#xD;
      interventions and any additional care needed are monitored and recorded during the follow-up&#xD;
      time. Patients are asked to contact the physician at any time if symptoms such as fever,&#xD;
      abdominal pain or jaundice occur.&#xD;
