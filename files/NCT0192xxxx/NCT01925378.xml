  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preliminary data showed that Nelfinavir has selective apoptotic effects on HPV+ cervical&#xD;
      tumor cell lines. Furthermore, in a Phase I clinical trial, the combination of NFV and&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy showed acceptable toxicity and promising activity in patients with&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer. Therefore, for the proposed research, the principal investigator will use&#xD;
      a single-arm Phase II intervention trial study design with focus on the efficacy of NFV to&#xD;
      induce complete or partial remission of CIN 2/3 or CIN 3 as well as biomarker evaluation.&#xD;

      2.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 2.1 Cervical Cancer Etiology and Targets for Intervention&#xD;
      Cervical cancer is one of the most common causes of cancer-related deaths in women worldwide.&#xD;
      Implementation of widespread screening has created drastic improvements in the incidence of&#xD;
      cervical cancer as well as significant decreases in mortality over the last 30 years. It is&#xD;
      estimated that in 2011, there will be 12,710 women in the US diagnosed with cervical cancer&#xD;
      and ultimately 4,290 women will die from the disease. Cervical cancer is unique in that there&#xD;
      exists a well-defined pre-malignant phase, referred to as cervical dysplasia, which can be&#xD;
      suspected on cytological examination (pap smear) of exfoliated cervical cells and confirmed&#xD;
      on histological examination of cervical biopsy material. The pre-cancerous changes represent&#xD;
      a spectrum of histological abnormalities or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) ranging&#xD;
      from CIN 1 (mild dysplasia) to CIN2 (moderate dysplasia) to CIN3 (severe dysplasia/ carcinoma&#xD;
      in situ). The timeline of progression for CIN 3 to invasive cancer in untreated women&#xD;
      averages between 8.1 and 12.6 years.The surgical treatment of cervical pre-cancerous is&#xD;
      therapeutically efficacious. However, it is an invasive procedure which has been associated&#xD;
      with fertility and obstetrical complications in reproductive aged women. An attractive&#xD;
      alternative to an excisional or ablative procedure would be to utilize an agent which could&#xD;
      be applied topically or taken by mouth to foster regression of cervical dysplasia. The use of&#xD;
      natural, synthetic, or biologic chemical agents to reverse, suppress, or prevent carcinogenic&#xD;
      progression is called chemoprevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prerequisite for cervical cancer is persistent infection by a high-risk human&#xD;
      papillomavirus allowing viral gene products sufficient time with which to induce&#xD;
      carcinogenesis through a generally well understood natural history. Cancer-associated HPV&#xD;
      types encode three oncogenes, E5, E6 and E7, and the E6 and E7 proteins have a significant&#xD;
      role in malignant transformation. E6 and E7 stimulate cell proliferation by interfering with&#xD;
      the function of regulatory proteins in cells, including the tumor suppressors p53 and pRB.&#xD;
      Co-expression of both E6 and E7 leads to indefinite proliferation and immortalization of&#xD;
      keratinocytes and induces premalignant neoplasms. HPV-E5, a transmembrane protein, can&#xD;
      activate PI3K-Akt signalling. The up-regulation of PI3K-Akt survival signaling protects&#xD;
      HPV-16 E5-expressing cells from apoptosis induced by ultraviolet irradiation. The major&#xD;
      transforming capability of HPV is dependent on E6 and E7. However, E5 is necessary for full&#xD;
      activation of E7, and the induction of PI3K-Akt-dependent apoptotic inhibition by E5&#xD;
      contributes to E7-mediated oncogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The work done to evaluate PI3K activity as a potential marker of CIN progression further&#xD;
      supports the idea that this pathway is also up-regulated in pre-cancerous lesions. The&#xD;
      catalytic subunit alpha of PI3K is expressed in non-invasive cervical lesions and has shown&#xD;
      potential as a carcinogenesis-related marker for early intraepithelial lesion of the uterine&#xD;
      cervix in cytology samples. Among other potential markers, PIK3CA showed a superior&#xD;
      specificity to distinguish CIN3 from other groups. Yao et al 2008 showed that positive rates&#xD;
      of PI3K and Akt were significantly lower in normal cervical epithelium and cervical&#xD;
      intraepithelial neoplasia than in cervical carcinoma (0.0% and 42.9% vs. 69.7%, P&lt;0.01; 10.0%&#xD;
      and 52.4% vs. 75.0%,P&lt;0.01). Specifically, PI3K/Akt activation increased with grade of&#xD;
      dysplasia with invasive carcinoma having the highest activity. They also showed that&#xD;
      expression of PI3K protein positively correlated to the expression of Akt protein(r=0.425,&#xD;
      P&lt;0.01).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Nelfinavir (NFV) Background Nelfinavir (NFV) induces cell cycle arrest, endoplasmic&#xD;
      reticulum stress, autophagy, and apoptosis is cancer cells. As a protease inhibitor used in&#xD;
      patients with HIV, NFV predominately targets proteases 1 and 2, but it is also known that&#xD;
      part of the efficacy is due to selective inhibition of the proteosome. The pathogenecity of&#xD;
      high risk HPV is dependent on expression of viral E6 proteins which inappropriately activate&#xD;
      the 26S proteosome to degrade p53 and other cellular proteins that are detrimental to viral&#xD;
      replication; specific HIV protease inhibitors can block the ability of HPV16 E6 to degrade&#xD;
      p53 and selectively kill E6-dependent cervical carcinoma cells. Furthermore, HIV protease&#xD;
      inhibitors have been shown to inhibit the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway with NFV being the most&#xD;
      potent. NFV's mechanism of action involves decreasing Akt phosphorylation. In addition, at&#xD;
      concentrations (micromolar) achievable in the serum of patients taking usual dosing of the&#xD;
      drug (1250mg PO BID), Akt phosphorylation is inhibited. At our institution, we have shown&#xD;
      that HPV-infected cervical cancer cells lines treated with NFV underwent apoptosis and&#xD;
      decreased cell proliferation in a dose dependent manner. Furthermore, we have shown through a&#xD;
      recent retrospective study that HIV-infected women with cervical dysplasia who were treated&#xD;
      with protease inhibitors (PI), including NFV were more likely to regress than those not on a&#xD;
      PI-containing regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because PI3K/Akt is up-regulated in CIN2/3 and NFV has been shown to inhibit this pathway in&#xD;
      HPV-infected cervical cancer cell lines, we aim to further evaluate the effectiveness of NFV&#xD;
      as an intervention for CIN2/3 and correlate these findings with phospho-Akt levels in&#xD;
      cervical tissue. Several intervention trials have been conducted in women with CIN using&#xD;
      retinoids, ÃŸ-carotene, difluoromethylornithine, and indole-3- carbinol and over 300 women&#xD;
      with CIN 3 were followed in these trials for one to 15 months while none of them developed&#xD;
      invasive cervical cancer. Therefore, this proposed intervention trial of 24 weeks (6 months)&#xD;
      duration should allow a safe evaluation of NFV as a potential agent for a future randomized&#xD;
      Phase III trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Development of a new drug for cancer treatment is expensive and time consuming. Repositioning&#xD;
      of a drug which is already FDA approved for another indication allows for more rapid&#xD;
      evaluation and potential implementation of a novel cancer therapy. NFV has been identified to&#xD;
      have anti-cancer effects in vitro, and compared to other protease inhibitors it is more&#xD;
      potent in causing cell death. NFV has over 10 years of safety and pharmacokinetic data in&#xD;
      HIV-infected individuals. Standard dosing for the treatment of HIV is 1,250 mg PO BID, and&#xD;
      this dose has demonstrated plasma concentrations in vivo which correlate with necessary&#xD;
      concentrations of successful in vitro studies. Furthermore, evaluation of the standard dose&#xD;
      offers the availability of commercially produced tablets, the known and acceptable side&#xD;
      effect profile, and the ease of twice daily dosing. For these reasons NFV is an excellent&#xD;
      candidate for repositioning as an intervention for cervical dysplasia, which can be quickly&#xD;
      evaluated in this phase II clinical trial.&#xD;
