  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clindamycin 1.0% - tretinoin 0.025% gel (CT Gel) is a reformulation of VELAC Gel that&#xD;
      contains the same active ingredients (clindamycin 1.0% and tretinoin 0.025%) in a modified&#xD;
      vehicle. This was a single-center, evaluator-blinded, randomized, placebo&#xD;
      (vehicle)-controlled phase 1 study to evaluate the phototoxic potential of CT Gel using 24&#xD;
      hour single applications of 3 sets of 3 study patches. The study expected to enroll&#xD;
      approximately 40 healthy adult volunteers. Each set of study patches consisted of a CT Gel&#xD;
      patch, a vehicle gel patch, and a blank patch (did not contain CT Gel or vehicle gel).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After concurrent 24-hour single applications of all 9 patches, 1 set of patches (set A) was&#xD;
      removed, and those sites were irradiated with 16 joules/cm2 of ultraviolet A light (UVA) and&#xD;
      0.75 minimal erythema dose (MED) with UVA/ultraviolet B light (UVB). The second set of&#xD;
      patches (set B) was removed, and those sites were irradiated with 16 joules/cm2 of UVA, 0.75&#xD;
      MED with UVB/UVA, followed by 15 joules/cm2 of visible light (VIS). The third set of patches&#xD;
      (set C) was then removed, and those sites served as a non irradiated control. Inflammatory&#xD;
      responses and other cutaneous effects were scored 1 hour after patch removal and during&#xD;
      follow-up visits at 24, 48, and 72 hours after patch removal.&#xD;

    <description>Three CT Gel patches were concurrently applied to designated test sites by trained technicians and held in place with hypoallergenic tape. Patches were prepared no longer than 30 minutes prior to application to study subjects. A minimum distance of ¾ of an inch from patch pad to patch pad was maintained on a subject's back. Approximately 24 ±1 hours after patch application, test patches were removed by trained technicians. Patch sites were evaluated for signs of inflammation according to procedures.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The capability of understanding and providing signed and dated written voluntary&#xD;
             informed consent (and any local or national authorization requirements) before any&#xD;
             protocol-specific procedures were performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Male or female subjects aged from 18 to 65 years, inclusive, at time of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The ability to complete the study and to comply with study instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Possessed Fitzpatrick skin type I (always burns easily; never tans), II (always burns&#xD;
             easily; tans minimally), or III (burns moderately; tans gradually) that would not&#xD;
             interfere with the reading of any skin responses. Determination of skin types was&#xD;
             based on sunburn and tanning histories, as well as subjects' opinions of their&#xD;
             responses to the first 30 to 45 minutes of sun exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Sexually active females of childbearing potential who agreed to use a medically&#xD;
             acceptable method of contraception while receiving protocol-assigned product. A woman&#xD;
             of childbearing potential was defined as one who was biologically capable of becoming&#xD;
             pregnant, including perimenopausal women who were less than 2 years from their last&#xD;
             menses. Acceptable contraceptive methods included the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hormonal contraception, including oral, injectable, or implantable methods&#xD;
                  started at least 2 months prior to screening. If hormonal contraception was&#xD;
                  started less than 2 months prior to screening, then a form of non-hormonal&#xD;
                  contraception was to have been added until the third continuous month of hormonal&#xD;
                  contraception was completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Two forms of non hormonal contraception, including intrauterine devices or&#xD;
                  properly used barrier methods (eg, male or female condoms, diaphragm, or cervical&#xD;
                  cap). Subjects with surgical sterilization, including tubal ligation or partner's&#xD;
                  vasectomy, were to have used a form of non-hormonal contraception. A barrier&#xD;
                  method or sterilization plus spermatocide were acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women who were not currently sexually active or lactating agreed to use a medically&#xD;
        accepted method of contraception if she became sexually active while participating in the&#xD;
        study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. Participated in a previous study of the same study product.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Current use of any medication which, in the opinion of the investigator, may have&#xD;
             affected the evaluation of the study product or placed the subject at undue risk.&#xD;

             have affected the evaluation of the study product or placed the subject at undue risk.&#xD;
