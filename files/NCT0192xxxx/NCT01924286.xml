  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis (TB) is the most common opportunistic infection amongst HIV-infected patients&#xD;
      starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) in developing countries and thus the most frequent form&#xD;
      of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). Paradoxical TB-IRIS occurs in 8- 43%&#xD;
      of patients starting ART while on TB treatment and results in morbidity, hospitalisation,&#xD;
      consumes health care resources and TB-IRIS may be fatal. We have previously demonstrated in a&#xD;
      clinical trial that prednisone reduces morbidity when used for treatment of paradoxical&#xD;
      TB-IRIS. This trial is a double-blind placebo-controlled trial of prophylactic prednisone&#xD;
      (40mg/day for 2 weeks followed by 20mg/day for 2 weeks, started on the same day as ART) in&#xD;
      patients with TB who are identified as being at high risk for paradoxical TB-IRIS (starting&#xD;
      ART within 30 days of initiating TB treatment and CD4 &lt; 100/μL). The trial will enroll 240&#xD;
      participants, randomised 1:1 (prednisone:placebo). The primary endpoint is development of&#xD;
      paradoxical TB-IRIS, defined using international consensus case definitions. Secondary&#xD;
      endpoints include time to IRIS event, severity of IRIS, quality of life assessment, mortality&#xD;
      and corticosteroids adverse events. The trial is powered to determine a reduction in TB-IRIS&#xD;
      events.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Objective: To determine whether the addition of prednisone to the first 4 weeks of&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) reduces the risk of paradoxical TB-IRIS in HIV-infected patients&#xD;
      being treated for TB who are at high risk of developing TB-IRIS (CD4 &lt;100 cells/μl and&#xD;
      starting ART within 30 days of TB treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the incidence of&#xD;
      paradoxical TB-IRIS over the first 12 weeks of ART in participants who receive a 4 week&#xD;
      course of prednisone versus participants who receive a 4 week course of placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary efficacy endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of paradoxical TB-IRIS within 12 weeks of starting ART (defined using the&#xD;
      International Network for the Study of HIV-associated IRIS (INSHI) consensus case&#xD;
      definition).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary efficacy endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Time to IRIS event&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Severity of IRIS events (defined by the following: need for hospitalisation for IRIS,&#xD;
           C-reactive protein, and neurological involvement)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Duration of TB-IRIS event (from onset of symptoms/signs to resolution of TB-IRIS&#xD;
           symptoms/signs)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Mortality attributed to TB and TB-IRIS&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. All-cause mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Composite endpoint of death, hospitalization, or hepatotoxicity (using the&#xD;
           protocol-specified definition of Grade 3 or 4 increase in ALT or bilirubin).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Other (non-TB) IRIS events&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Quality of life assessment (measured using PROQOL-HIV, EQ-5D-3L, HIV symptom index and&#xD;
           Karnofsky score)&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Adverse events and severe adverse events ascribed to TB treatment, ART or&#xD;
           co-trimoxazole. This will include a pre-specified analysis of drug-induced liver injury&#xD;
           and drug rash. This assessment will include the number of treatment interruptions for&#xD;
           drug adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Discontinuation of either ART or TB treatment for &gt; 5 days due to adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Number of hospitalizations and total days hospitalized&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and tolerability endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Corticosteroid-associated adverse events, classified by severity and relation to study&#xD;
           drug. These will include hypertension, hyperglycaemia, hypomania/mania, depression,&#xD;
           acne, epigastric pain, upper gastro-intestinal bleeding, Cushingoid features, new oedema&#xD;
           and avascular bone necrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Laboratory safety data: glucose, full blood count and electrolytes&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Other infections (AIDS-related, bacterial, fungal and viral) and malignancies (Kaposi's&#xD;
           sarcoma)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. All grade 1, 2, 3 and 4 adverse events (clinical and laboratory using the ACTG grading&#xD;
           system)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: 240 participants will be enrolled over 13 months. Each participant will be&#xD;
      followed for 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: HIV-infected, ART-naïve adult (≥ 18 years) patients diagnosed with active&#xD;
      tuberculosis who have a CD4 &lt; 100 cells/μL and who start ART within 30 days of starting TB&#xD;
      treatment. Other inclusion criteria include: diagnosis of TB (smear, culture, Xpert MTB/RIF&#xD;
      test, histology or strong clinical and radiological evidence of TB with symptomatic response&#xD;
      to TB treatment), eligible for and consent to starting ART and written informed consent for&#xD;
      trial. Exclusion criteria include: Kaposi's sarcoma, pregnancy, TB meningitis or tuberculoma&#xD;
      at TB diagnosis (because these patients receive corticosteroids), known rifampicin-resistant&#xD;
      TB, being on corticosteroids for another indication within the past 7 days, on other&#xD;
      immunosuppressive medication within the past 7 days and uncontrolled diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TB treatment and ART: TB treatment will be prescribed and monitored by the clinical staff in&#xD;
      the local HIV-TB clinic. TB treatment will be given according to South African Department of&#xD;
      Health guidelines. This involves rifampicin (R), isoniazid (H), ethambutol (E) and&#xD;
      pyrazinamide (Z) for 2 months followed by RH for 4 months. ART will be prescribed by the&#xD;
      clinical staff at the HIV-TB clinic according to South African Department of Health&#xD;
      guidelines. Standard first line ART in TB patients is tenofovir, emtricitabine (or&#xD;
      lamivudine) and efavirenz. Co-trimoxazole prophylaxis will be prescribed to all patients&#xD;
      unless a contra-indication exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Oral prednisone 40mg daily for 14 doses started on the first day that ART is&#xD;
      taken, followed by 20mg daily for 14 doses (or identical placebo). A total of 28 days of&#xD;
      study medication will thus be prescribed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up: Patients will be screened once established on TB treatment, but before starting&#xD;
      ART. If the patient is eligible, written informed consent will be taken. There will be six&#xD;
      planned study visits that will be in relation to the start of ART: week 0 (the day ART is&#xD;
      initiated), week 1, week 2, week 4, week 8 and week 12. Patients will be seen at unscheduled&#xD;
      visits if clinical deterioration occurs. If paradoxical TB-IRIS is diagnosed this will be&#xD;
      treated with open label prednisone at clinician discretion if symptoms are moderate or&#xD;
      severe. If patients experience clinical complications (eg. TB-IRIS) follow-up will be&#xD;
      prolonged beyond week 12 in order to stabilize their condition before referral back to the&#xD;
      general TB-HIV clinical service for ongoing management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data monitoring: The trial will be monitored by an independent Data and Safety Monitoring&#xD;
      Board (DSMB) comprising 3 independent researchers and an independent statistician. After an&#xD;
      initial meeting for agreeing on their Charter, the DSMB will meet twice (after 80 and 160&#xD;
      participants have completed follow-up) to review data quality and data with respect to safety&#xD;
      and trial endpoints. If there is evidence of harm related to study medication or trial&#xD;
      conduct the DSMB may advise the sponsor that trial enrollment should be stopped.&#xD;

             ethambutol)&#xD;
