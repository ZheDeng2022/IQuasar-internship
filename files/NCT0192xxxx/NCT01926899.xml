        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Voluntary written informed consent before performance of any study-related procedure&#xD;
             not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn&#xD;
             by the subject at any time without prejudice to future medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Female subject of childbearing potential agree to practice 2 effective methods of&#xD;
                  contraception from the time of signing the informed consent form through 30 days&#xD;
                  after the last dose of bortezomib, or agree to completely abstain from&#xD;
                  heterosexual intercourse.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male subjects, even if surgically sterilized (i.e., status postvasectomy) must&#xD;
                  agree to 1 of the following: practice effective barrier contraception during the&#xD;
                  entire study treatment period and through a minimum of 30 days after the last&#xD;
                  dose of study drug, or completely abstain from heterosexual intercourse.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Subjects must meet other institutional criteria for alloHSCT&#xD;
