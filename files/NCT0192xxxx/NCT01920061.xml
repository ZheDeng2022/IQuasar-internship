    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate PF-05212384 (gedatolisib) PI3K/mTOR inhibitor)) in combination with&#xD;
      either docetaxel, cisplatin or dacomitinib in select advanced solid tumors. The study will&#xD;
      assess the safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of these combinations in patients&#xD;
      with advanced cancer in order to determine the maximum tolerated dose in each combination.&#xD;
      The cisplatin combination expansion portion will evaluate the anti tumor activity of PF&#xD;
      05212384 plus cisplatin in patients with TNBC in 2 separate Arms (Arm 1 and Arm 2).&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Objective Response - Arm B Expansion</measure>
    <time_frame>Cycle 1 Day 1 up to 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants with objective response based on the assessment of confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1). Confirmed responses are those that persist on repeat imaging study at least 4 weeks after initial documentation of response.&#xD;
Per RECIST v1.1: CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions and non-target disease, with the exception of nodal disease. All nodes, both target and non-target, must decrease to normal (short axis &lt;10 mm) and no new lesions. PR was defined as &gt;=30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target lesions. The short axis was used in the sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter was used in the sum for all other target lesions. No unequivocal progression of non-target disease and no new lesions.</description>

Confirmed responses are those that persist on repeat imaging study at least 4 weeks after initial documentation of response.&#xD;
Per RECIST v1.1: CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions and non-target disease, with the exception of nodal disease. All nodes, both target and non-target, must decrease to normal (short axis &lt;10 mm) and no new lesions. PR was defined as &gt;=30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target lesions. The short axis was used in the sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter was used in the sum for all other target lesions. No unequivocal progression of non-target disease and no new lesions.</description>

        <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participants administered a product or medical device; the event needed not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment or usage. Treatment Emergent AEs were those occurred for the first time after the start of study treatment and within 28 days after final dose of study treatment and was not seen prior to the start of treatment, or those were seen prior to the start of study treatment but increased in Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade after the start of study treatment and within 28 days after final dose of study treatment. AEs were graded by the investigator according to the CTCAE version 4.03 : Grade 1: mild AE; Grade 2: moderate AE; Grade 3: severe AE; Grade 4: life-threatening consequences, urgent intervention indicated; Grade 5: death related to AE.</description>

          <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participants administered a product or medical device; the event needed not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment or usage. Treatment Emergent AEs were those occurred for the first time after the start of study treatment and within 28 days after final dose of study treatment and was not seen prior to the start of treatment, or those were seen prior to the start of study treatment but increased in Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade after the start of study treatment and within 28 days after final dose of study treatment. AEs were graded by the investigator according to the CTCAE version 4.03 : Grade 1: mild AE; Grade 2: moderate AE; Grade 3: severe AE; Grade 4: life-threatening consequences, urgent intervention indicated; Grade 5: death related to AE.</description>

        <description>Biopsies were obtained at screening and after drug administration. These samples were analyzed predominantly for phosphoprotein biomarkers indicative of pathway modulation, or for genetic markers correlated to drug sensitivity (eg, emerging KRAS mutation and BRAF mutation). BRAF mutation categories included BRAF mutation status and V600E. KRAS mutation categories included GLY12ALA, GLY12ARG, GLY12ASP, GLY12CYS, GLY12SER, GLY12VAL and GLY13ASP.</description>

Each treatment cycle was defined as 21 days. Participants received intravenous infusion of PF-05212384 90-180 mg once on Day -7 and Cycle 1 Day 2, and docetaxel 75 mg/m2 1-hour IV infusion once on Cycle 1 Day 1. On Day 1 for Cycles 2 and beyond, participants received docetaxel 75 mg/m2 1-hour IV infusion once followed by PF-05212384 90-180 mg once. The maximum duration of PF-05212384 treatment was 505 days and the maximum duration of docetaxel treatment was 445 days.</description>

        <description>Biopsies were obtained at screening and after drug administration. These samples were analyzed predominantly for phosphoprotein biomarkers indicative of pathway modulation, or for genetic markers correlated to drug sensitivity (eg, emerging KRAS mutation and BRAF mutation). BRAF mutation categories included BRAF mutation status and V600E. KRAS mutation categories included GLY12ALA, GLY12ARG, GLY12ASP, GLY12CYS, GLY12SER, GLY12VAL and GLY13ASP.</description>

        <description>Biopsies were obtained at screening and after drug administration. These samples were analyzed predominantly for phosphoprotein biomarkers indicative of pathway modulation, or for genetic markers correlated to drug sensitivity (eg, emerging KRAS mutation and BRAF mutation). BRAF mutation categories included BRAF mutation status and V600E. KRAS mutation categories included GLY12ALA, GLY12ARG, GLY12ASP, GLY12CYS, GLY12SER, GLY12VAL and GLY13ASP.</description>

        <description>Biopsies were obtained at screening and after drug administration. These samples were analyzed predominantly for phosphoprotein biomarkers indicative of pathway modulation, or for genetic markers correlated to drug sensitivity (eg, emerging KRAS mutation and BRAF mutation). BRAF mutation categories included BRAF mutation status and V600E. KRAS mutation categories included GLY12ALA, GLY12ARG, GLY12ASP, GLY12CYS, GLY12SER, GLY12VAL and GLY13ASP.</description>

Each treatment cycle was defined as 21 days. Participants received intravenous infusion of PF-05212384 90-150 mg once on Day -14 and dacomitinib 30-45 mg orally once on Day -7. On Cycle 1 Day 1, participants received dacomitinib 30-45 mg orally once. On Cycle 1 Day 2, participants received treatment with dacomitinib 30 mg orally once followed by PF-05212384 90-150 mg once. On Day 1 for Cycles 2 and beyond, participants received dacomitinib 30-45 mg orally once followed by PF-05212384 90-150 mg once. The maximum duration of PF-05212384 treatment was 842 days and the maximum duration of dacomitinib treatment was 841 days.</description>

          <description>Triplicate 12-lead ECG measurements (each recording separated by approximately 2 minutes) were performed and average was calculated. The time corresponding to beginning of depolarization to repolarization of the ventricles (QT interval) was adjusted for RR interval using QT and RR from each ECG by Fridericia's formula (QTcF = QT divided by cube root of RR) and by Bazette's formula (QTcB = QT divided by square root of RR). Participants with maximum increase from baseline of 30 to less than (&lt;) 60 msec(borderline) and greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 60 msec (prolonged) were summarized.</description>

Per RECIST v1.1: CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions and non-target disease, with the exception of nodal disease. All nodes, both target and non-target, must decrease to normal (short axis &lt;10 mm) and no new lesions. PR was defined as &gt;=30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target lesions. The short axis was used in the sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter was used in the sum for all other target lesions. No unequivocal progression of non-target disease and no new lesions.</description>

        <description>European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core-30 (EORTC QLQ-C30): included functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), global health status, symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting) and single items (dyspnoea, appetite loss, insomnia, constipation/diarrhea and financial difficulties). Most questions used 4 point scale (1 'Not at all' to 4 'Very much'; 2 questions used 7-point scale (1 'very poor' to 7 'Excellent'). Scores averaged, transformed to 0-100 scale; higher score=better level of functioning or greater degree of symptoms.</description>
