      Intraoperative blood glucose concentration abnormalities are associated with increased&#xD;
      perioperative morbidity and mortality (1-4). Severe intraoperative hyperglycemia (BGC ≥ 200&#xD;
      mg/dl) in patients undergoing craniotomy for urgent/emergent craniotomy after traumatic brain&#xD;
      injury complicates 15% of the cases and is associated with higher in-hospital mortality.&#xD;
      Intraoperative use of dexamethasone during craniotomy is also known to induce an increase in&#xD;
      blood glucose concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The importance of blood glucose concentration in neurosurgical patients is witnessed by the&#xD;
      effects of tight blood glucose control on incidence of infections and neurological outcome .&#xD;
      Currently available evidence suggest that, in neurosurgical patients, perioperative BGC&#xD;
      values should be within the 80-180 mg/dl range .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on the prevalence of severe intraoperative hyper (blood glucose concentration &gt;180&#xD;
      mg/dl) and hypoglycemia (blood glucose concentration &lt;80 mg/dl) in patients undergoing&#xD;
      craniotomy for supra or infratentorial surgery as elective or emergency procedure are lacking&#xD;
      as it is not known whether in these patients intraoperative severe hyperglycemia relates to&#xD;
      an increased incidence of postoperative infections is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of this prospective observational study -in patients undergoing craniotomy for supra or&#xD;
      infratentorial surgery as elective or emergency procedure- was to test the hypothesis that&#xD;
      severe intraoperative hyperglycemia (blood glucose concentration ≥180mg/dl) is associated&#xD;
      with an increased incidence of infections within the first postoperative week (pneumonia,&#xD;
      sepsis, urinary and wound and cerebral infections). We also recorded the prevalence of severe&#xD;
      intraoperative hyper and hypoglycemia (blood glucose concentration&lt;80 mg/dl) in recruited&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

      METHODS Study Design This prospective observational cohort study, in adult patients who&#xD;
      underwent craniotomy for supra or infratentorial surgery as elective or emergency procedure,&#xD;
      was approved by the University of Rome &quot;Sapienza&quot;, Policlinico Umberto I hospital,&#xD;
      Institutional Review Board (2665, 28/3/2013). Recruited patients were categorized according&#xD;
      the type of procedure into 4 groups: primary brain tumors (gliomas and meningiomas);&#xD;
      metastatic tumors; neurovascular lesions (intracranial hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage,&#xD;
      arterovenous malformation); traumatic brain injury (14-16). In each group &quot;elective&quot; and&#xD;
      &quot;emergency&quot; procedures were recorded apart. Because of the observational study design,&#xD;
      perioperative clinical management was run by the attending anesthesiologist. Standard of care&#xD;
      guidelines do not include the use of insulin infusion should full nutritional supply is not&#xD;
      provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients population Adults ≥18 years of age, who underwent elective or emergency craniotomy&#xD;
      for brain lesions in the supra or infratentorial space were prospectively recruited. In all&#xD;
      patients intraoperative blood glucose concentration was measured twice: at the beginning of&#xD;
      the procedure (immediately after endotracheal intubation) and at the end of surgery&#xD;
      (immediately before extubation) on arterial whole blood by blood gas analysis&#xD;
      (Instrumentation Laboratory, BGA analyzer GEM 4000, UK). Patients with one or both BGC&gt;180&#xD;
      mg/dl were categorized as having &quot;severe intraoperative hyperglycemia&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative Setting All patients received normal saline (NaCl 0.9%) as pre and&#xD;
      intraoperative fluid infusion. There was no fixed protocol for the anesthetic management and&#xD;
      the anesthetic regime was determined by the attending anesthesiologist. Anesthesia was&#xD;
      maintained with either halogenated inhalational anaesthetics (desflurane or sevoflurane) or&#xD;
      with continuous propofol infusion and fentanyl as per clinical needs. Intraoperative&#xD;
      monitoring was accomplished with 3 leads ECG, SpO2, end tidal CO2, invasive arterial&#xD;
      pressure, core body temperature and urine output. Patients were normoventilated (PaCO2 35-40&#xD;
      mmHg) and mild hyperventilation was used to facilitate brain relaxation only when necessary .&#xD;
      There was no dedicated protocol for treatment of intraoperative hyperglycemia and&#xD;
      intraoperative insulin use was discouraged unless the attending anesthesiologist considered&#xD;
      it necessary. Recorded demographic and clinical characteristics included: age, gender,&#xD;
      localization of the brain lesion (supra or infratentorial), type of surgery (primary brain&#xD;
      tumors, metastatic brain tumors, neurovascular, traumatic brain), setting of surgery&#xD;
      (elective or emergent), duration of surgery, history of diabetes mellitus (and the use of&#xD;
      chronic oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin), associated cardiac, vascular, renal or hepatic&#xD;
      morbidity the intraoperative use of mannitol and steroids. In the postoperative period, all&#xD;
      patients were kept fasting for the first 24 hours, subsequently full calories load -by self&#xD;
      alimentation or enteral/parenteral nutrition- was warranted. As per local protocol, in the&#xD;
      postoperative period, insulin was administered only in patients with blood glucose&#xD;
      concentration&gt; 180 mg/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definitions Hyperglycemia was defined as BGC ≥ 180 mg/dL. Hypoglycemia was defined as&#xD;
      glucose≤ 80 mg/dL. Postoperative infections (pneumonia, blood stream-sepsis, urinary,&#xD;
      surgical site/wound and cerebral infections) diagnosed according to Center for Disease&#xD;
      Control and Prevention criteria within 7 days after surgery . The onset and type of infection&#xD;
      was determined by 2 consultants for infective disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes The primary outcome was the prevalence of postoperative infections in normoglycemic&#xD;
      patients and in those that presented at one intraoperative blood glucose concentration ≥ 180&#xD;
      mg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes measures were: incidence of severe intraoperative hyper (blood glucose&#xD;
      concentration ≥180 mg/dL) and hypo (blood glucose concentration &lt;80 mg/dL) glycemia in&#xD;
      patients undergone craniotomy; the relationship between the setting of surgery (elective or&#xD;
      emergency), history of diabetes mellitus and intraoperative use of mannitol or steroids and&#xD;
      severe intraoperative hyperglycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis For sample size calculation, we hypothesize that incidence of post&#xD;
      operative infections would be 30% higher in patients that had a severe intraoperative&#xD;
      hyperglycemia. We estimated that 28 patients should be recruited in each study group to&#xD;
      detect a 30% difference in the incidence of postoperative infections. A difference in the&#xD;
      incidence of intraoperative hypo and hyper glycemia in the different subgroups of patients&#xD;
      undergone craniotomy was calculated using the Chi square test.&#xD;
