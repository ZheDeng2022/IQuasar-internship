  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare disease, caused by impairment of the motile cilia.&#xD;
      Patients present with chronic upper and lower respiratory tract infections. The therapy is&#xD;
      mainly supportive and based on that of cystic fibrosis. Chest physiotherapy is one of the&#xD;
      cornerstones of the therapy, however the influence of chest physiotherapy on lung function&#xD;
      (short term and long term) is not clear. For interpretation of longitudinal lung function&#xD;
      data it is important to examine the short time effect of chest physiotherapy. We hypothesize&#xD;
      that a session of chest physiotherapy improves lung function and that thus lung function&#xD;
      tests must be performed in a standardized way.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare disease, caused by congenital dysfunction of the&#xD;
      motile cilia, located in the upper and lower respiratory tract, in the reproductive system&#xD;
      and in the embryonal node. Ineffective ciliary beating results in disturbed mucociliary&#xD;
      clearance, which is an important defense mechanism in the respiratory tract. It causes&#xD;
      recurrent and chronic upper and lower respiratory tract infections, leading to reversible&#xD;
      (mucus plugging) and irreversible lung damage (bronchiectasis, atelectasis, mucus plugging).&#xD;
      Just like cystic fibrosis, it is characterized by obstructive lung disease, measured by&#xD;
      spirometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using Multiple Breath Washout measurements, it has been shown that peripheral airways disease&#xD;
      is present in PCD. Probably, MBW parameters are already abnormal before forced expiratory&#xD;
      volume in one second is abnormal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The therapy for patients with PCD is mainly supportive: regular oral or intravenous&#xD;
      antibiotics to treat airway infections and chest physiotherapy to actively increase&#xD;
      mucociliary clearance. Chest physiotherapy has the objective to clear mucus from the lungs.&#xD;
      Guidelines support the treatment of patients with PCD with chest physiotherapy. It is known&#xD;
      that in patients with PCD, exercise has a more bronchodilating effect than the administration&#xD;
      of salbutamol. However, no objective data describe the acute effect of chest physiotherapy on&#xD;
      spirometry and MBW parameters. Moreover, short term effects of intervention on spirometry and&#xD;
      MBW parameters can influence the interpretation of long-term evolution of these parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In cystic fibrosis, one study has assessed the short-term influence of chest physiotherapy on&#xD;
      lung function, measured by spirometry and MBW before and after chest physiotherapy. The&#xD;
      authors found no significant influence of chest physiotherapy on spirometry parameters, nor&#xD;
      on MBW parameters. Therefore, longitudinal interpretation can be performed irrespective of&#xD;
      the timing of the lung function measurements. However, cystic fibrosis and PCD have a&#xD;
      different pathophysiological mechanism with a more 'mechanical' disturbance of the&#xD;
      mucociliary clearance in PCD, compared to a more 'viscous' disturbance of mucociliary&#xD;
      clearance in CF. Therefore, the results in CF are not applicable to PCD. Even more, we&#xD;
      hypothesize that chest physiotherapy will have a significant effect on lung function&#xD;
      parameters (spirometry and MBW) in patients with PCD due to its external mechanical effect on&#xD;
      mucus clearance.&#xD;
