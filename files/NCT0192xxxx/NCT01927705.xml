      The purpose of phase I clinical trial is to evaluate safety and efficacy in subjects with&#xD;
      over Moderately subacute and chronic Atopic Dermatitis after inject. Also, The purpose of&#xD;
      phase IIa clinical trial is to determine clinically proper dose capacity of FURESTEM-AD Inj.&#xD;
      by evaluating safety and efficacy based on SCORAD INDEX in subjects with over Moderately&#xD;
      subacute and chronic Atopic Dermatitis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis is recurring and chronic Allergic eczema which accompanies serious itching&#xD;
      and xeroderma. Atopic dermatitis has special features such as increase of acidophil, high&#xD;
      expression ratio of IgE in the blood. Recently, Atopic dermatitis is estimated to developing&#xD;
      for 10 to 20 percent of the population in the world. However, there is no distinguished&#xD;
      treatment to completely recover. Especially, most of diagnosis are made when the patients are&#xD;
      younger than 5 years old. Moreover, 50 percent of them get diagnose Atopic dermatitis between&#xD;
      6 month and 24 month. According to the National epidemiological investigation conducted by&#xD;
      the Korean Academy of Pediatric Allergy and Respiratory Disease, Outbreak ratio of Atopic&#xD;
      dermatitis continually increase for the past decade. Accordingly, it has become a major&#xD;
      social concern. It is really important for the patients to care and diagnose as soon as they&#xD;
      find out symptoms of Atopic dermatitis. The reason is that 50 to 75 percent of the Atopic&#xD;
      dermatitis patients are suffering from Allergies which cause asthma and rhinitis. Recently,&#xD;
      It has been reported that Mesenchymal stem cells have special abilities to restrict the&#xD;
      growth of lymphocyte non-specific and to restrict the activation of lymphocyte by the&#xD;
      stimulus of mitogen or antigen. It is also reported that the restrict of lymphocyte by&#xD;
      Mesenchymal stem cells does not need HLA-matching unlike the case of T-cell. It has been&#xD;
      found that Mesenchymal stem cells' ability of autoimmune induction is weak because of low&#xD;
      expression of antigen like HLA-DR. It is also discovered that Mesenchymal stem cells do not&#xD;
      cause autoimmune side-effect even though we inject them in the body. When the body get&#xD;
      infected by the pathogens, innate immune response operate as the primary defence mechanism.&#xD;
      at this time, there are some receptors reacting first such as TLR(toll-like receptor) and&#xD;
      NLR(nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain) which is located in the cytoplasm of a cell.&#xD;
      It is reported that the activities of TLR which is expressed by Mesenchymal stem cells play&#xD;
      an important roles about immunomodulatory ability of Mesenchymal stem cells. Furthermore,&#xD;
      human Umbilical Cord Blood derived-Universal Stem Cells( hUCB-USCs) manifest TLR and NLR of&#xD;
      Mesenchymal Stem cells at the same time. when those receptors become activation, it maximize&#xD;
      ability of immunomodulatory. Therefore, hUCB-USCs can be utilized to cure intractable&#xD;
      autoimmune disease like Atopic dermatitis. Further, It has huge possibility as cell therapy&#xD;
      products for autoimmune disease.&#xD;
