      A. Objectives &amp; Hypothesis Overactive bladder (OAB) affects over 10 million adults in the&#xD;
      United States and each year substantial costs are incurred from private and public funds to&#xD;
      test the efficacy of new and existing drugs for OAB.14 However, effectiveness and adherence&#xD;
      data from traditional clinical trials are not generalizable to clinical practice.3, 4 In an&#xD;
      era of limited resources and competing demands, it is essential that cost-effectiveness data&#xD;
      from clinical trials be generalizable to the clinical world. Pragmatic clinical trials&#xD;
      measure the effectiveness of treatments in real clinical practice, and in the full spectrum&#xD;
      of patients that require treatment.5 Pragmatic trials require patient reported outcomes that&#xD;
      are valid but have low patient burden.5 The conduct of pragmatic clinical trials for OAB has&#xD;
      been limited by a lack of instruments that have demonstrable validity and reliability in the&#xD;
      typical clinical setting Pill counts, used to measure primary outcomes in most traditional&#xD;
      trials, are burdensome in the clinical setting.1610 The optimal instrument for measuring&#xD;
      utility scores, general quality of life scores for cost-effectiveness analyses for OAB, is&#xD;
      also not known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although poor adherence carries the potential for continued suffering for patients and wasted&#xD;
      health care resources, there is a lack of data on the clinical and economic impact of poor&#xD;
      adherence to treatment for OAB in real-world clinical practice. We have published preliminary&#xD;
      data that underscores the role of adherence and utilities in the treatment of OAB. 3 Our&#xD;
      hypothesis is that effectiveness, adherence, and utility preference scores can be measured&#xD;
      using pragmatic patient reported instruments and that poor adherence is associated with lower&#xD;
      effectiveness and quality of life in adults with OAB in a clinical setting. Specifically, the&#xD;
      overriding goal of this proposal is to validate pragmatic instruments to measure&#xD;
      effectiveness, adherence and utility preference scores and obtain preliminary data on the&#xD;
      effect of adherence and quality of life in adults undergoing treatment for overactive bladder&#xD;
      in a clinical setting.&#xD;

      Specific Aim 1: To determine the validity and responsiveness of pragmatic patient reported&#xD;
      outcome instruments to measure clinical effectiveness, adherence and utility preference&#xD;
      scores in adults undergoing treatment with anti-cholinergic medications for overactive&#xD;
      bladder. We will perform a prospective cohort study of adults with OAB undergoing treatment&#xD;
      with anti-cholinergic medication. We will compare improvement in urinary symptoms (clinical&#xD;
      effectiveness), adherence, and change in utility preference scores from baseline to 3 months&#xD;
      of treatment using new and existing 'gold standard' instruments. The results will be&#xD;
      informative as to which, if any of these pragmatic instruments, is useful for measuring&#xD;
      effectiveness, adherence, and utility preference scores in the 'real world' clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To use the newly validated pragmatic instruments to measure the impact of&#xD;
      adherence on clinical effectiveness and health related quality of life in a real world&#xD;
      clinical setting in adults undergoing treatment with anti-cholinergic medications for&#xD;
      overactive bladder. The impact of adherence on clinical effectiveness and health related&#xD;
      quality of life will be measured through comparisons in adults with high and low adherence to&#xD;
      anti-cholinergic medication. This aim will corroborate the findings of aim 1 and establish if&#xD;
      pragmatic instruments are useful in measuring outcomes of effectiveness, adherence and&#xD;
      utility preference scores. These results will also provide preliminary data on the&#xD;
      effectiveness of anti-cholinergic medication and the impact of adherence on clinical&#xD;
      effectiveness and quality of life in the clinical setting.&#xD;
