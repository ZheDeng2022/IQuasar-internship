  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Seventy patients in cardiac rehabilitation with maximal exercise capacity less than 1.4 watt&#xD;
      per kilogram bodyweight will be randomized 1:1 into either an intervention training (IN)&#xD;
      group or usual care (UC). The IN patients will perform supervised endurance and resistance&#xD;
      exercise for approximately 90 minutes once a week and traditional cardiac rehabilitation&#xD;
      (TCR) once a week; the UC patients will perform TCR twice a week. The intervention is planned&#xD;
      for six months with a follow-up of a further six months. The primary investigation is&#xD;
      differences between IN and UC with regard to changes in exercise capacity (max watt/kgBW).&#xD;

      The DOPPELHERZ (The influence of individualized resistance-endurance exercise training on&#xD;
      maximal power output in outpatient cardiac rehabilitation) randomized controlled trial was&#xD;
      performed at the Department of Prevention and Sports Medicine, Klinikum rechts der Isar in&#xD;
      Munich, Germany. 70 patients eligible for and/or participating in cardiac rehabilitation were&#xD;
      randomized to six months in an individualized combined exercise group (ICE) or group- based&#xD;
      cardiac rehabilitation (GCR), considered usual care in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients gave written informed consent, the study protocol was approved by the local&#xD;
      university hospital ethics committee, all procedures were conducted according to the&#xD;
      Declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: All patients were American Heart Association Class &quot;C&quot; (moderate to high risk)&#xD;
      based on the presence of cardiac disease and maximal power output of &lt;5 METs (corresponding&#xD;
      to &lt;1.4 W/kg body weight), who met eligibility criteria for CR at the time of recruitment.&#xD;
      Patients with decompensated or highly symptomatic (NYHA IV) heart failure, acute illness or&#xD;
      injury, cardiac hospitalizations within six weeks of inclusion, drug abuse, unstable blood&#xD;
      pressure or arrhythmias, high grade valve stenosis or instable diabetes mellitus were&#xD;
      excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint: The primary endpoint was change in maximal relative power output (W/kg)&#xD;
      measured by CPX after six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise training program In both the intervention and usual care arms of the study, exercise&#xD;
      training was prescribed twice weekly over a period of six months, and all exercise sessions&#xD;
      were led by certified exercise instructors and monitored by physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group-based cardiac rehabilitation (GCR): The GCR group performed regular exercise in a&#xD;
      state-sanctioned cardiac rehabilitation group. This form of GCR is considered Phase III&#xD;
      aftercare and has been described elsewhere9. Briefly, GCR patients received&#xD;
      moderate-intensity heart rate targets from exercise cardiologists based on CPX results. The&#xD;
      group-based program is offered for 90 minutes twice a week and is a combination of gymnastics&#xD;
      (including endurance and resistance components), coordination and flexibility exercises, and&#xD;
      includes educational components targeting diet and nutrition, stress and relaxation, methods&#xD;
      for coping with CVD and behavioral and lifestyle change. The GCR sessions were conducted at a&#xD;
      local university gymnasium and were performed in groups of up to 15 participants, as&#xD;
      recommended by the German Federal Association for Rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individualized combined exercise (ICE): The ICE group participated in once-weekly&#xD;
      individualized combined resistance-endurance exercise training for 60 minutes and once-weekly&#xD;
      traditional group-based cardiac rehabilitation as described above. The ICE intervention&#xD;
      included 30 minutes of endurance exercise at 60-70% VO2peak and RPE 11-14 and five resistance&#xD;
      exercises (chest press, leg press, lat pull-downs, shoulder press and seated cable row)&#xD;
      following the recommendations of the German Federation for Cardiovascular Prevention and&#xD;
      Rehabilitation (DGPR) and targeting the large muscle groups at an RPE&lt;16. For the first three&#xD;
      months, patients performed two sets of 12-25 repetitions at 30-50% 1RM; after three months&#xD;
      patients were retested and thereafter performed two sets of 8-15 repetitions at 40-60% 1RM.&#xD;
      The ICE sessions were located at the university sports medicine rehabilitation center and&#xD;
      performed in groups of not more than four patients. They were instructed at a maximum 2:1&#xD;
      participant to therapist ratio.&#xD;
