      High grade cerebral glioma is the most common primary brain tumor in adults and accounts for&#xD;
      about 2.5% of all cancer deaths. Brain tumor affects approximately 2300 individuals per year&#xD;
      in Canada. Noninvasive accurate and timely diagnosis is imperative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High grade glioma is an aggressive neoplasm with median survival of 12 months, irrespective&#xD;
      of any treatment. The prognosis of these patients can only be decided based on pathology&#xD;
      after biopsy or surgery. Conventional imaging techniques, such as routine magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging(MRI), do not accurately predict the grade of malignancy of cerebral gliomas. Computed&#xD;
      tomography(CT) perfusion allows us to study the blood supply to the tumor at the level of&#xD;
      capillaries. This information permits determination of aggressiveness of cerebral gliomas at&#xD;
      the time of diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a preliminary study of 20 patients with high grade cerebral gliomas, we have shown that CT&#xD;
      perfusion can predict survival at the time of diagnosis irrespective of the pathological&#xD;
      grade and the treatment received. In the present study, we would like to extend our&#xD;
      preliminary findings in larger group of patients to ensure that this technique is indeed&#xD;
      robust. If our hypothesis was supported by our study, we will be able to subselect patients&#xD;
      based on initial imaging for more aggressive treatment. In patients with shorter survival,&#xD;
      the perfusion parameters may help in identifying new therapeutic targets (e.g.,&#xD;
      anti-angiogenic agents) that may help in the treatment of these patients.&#xD;

      Purpose of the research: Evaluate the utility of the non-invasive imaging tool of computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT) perfusion in preoperative prognostication of high grade cerebral gliomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background information: Brain tumour affects approximately 2300 individuals per year in&#xD;
      Canada. High grade glioma is the most common primary brain tumour in adults and accounts for&#xD;
      approximately 2.5% of all cancer deaths. The real incidence of high grade glioma in the&#xD;
      country is not known, but it affects approximately 2 per 100,000 people per year in Nova&#xD;
      Scotia. Non-invasive, accurate and timely diagnosis is imperative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High grade glioma is an aggressive neoplasm, and the median survival of affected patients is&#xD;
      12 months, irrespective of any form of treatment. The prognosis of these patients can only be&#xD;
      determined on pathology after biopsy or surgery. Conventional imaging techniques such as as&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) alone do not help in predicting the level of malignancy of&#xD;
      cerebral gliomas. Formation of new blood vessels plays a central role in the growth and&#xD;
      spread of tumours. The advanced imaging tool of computed tomography(CT) perfusion can be used&#xD;
      to study blood supply to the tumor at the level of capillaries. This information permits&#xD;
      determination of aggressiveness of cerebral gliomas at the time of diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To direct better and aggressive care in patients with high grade cerebral glioma, it is&#xD;
      important to identify patients whose life expectancy could be relatively longer. The two high&#xD;
      grades of gliomas have been grouped together in the literature for both treatment and&#xD;
      prognosis. There are only a few studies that have addressed the differentiation of the two&#xD;
      higher grades of gliomas. Some of these are our own preliminary studies. In a preliminary&#xD;
      study of 20 such patients,investigators have shown that CT perfusion can predict survival,&#xD;
      irrespective of the pathological grade and treatement received. In the present study,&#xD;
      investigators would like to extend our preliminary findings in a larger group of patients to&#xD;
      ensure that this technique is indeed robust. In patients with shorter survival, the perfusion&#xD;
      parameters may help in identifying new therapeutic targets (e.g., anti-angiogenic agents)&#xD;
      that may help in the treatment of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both CT and MR perfusion studies can be used to assess the blood supply of brain tumors. MR&#xD;
      perfusion is limited in terms of absolute quantification of the perfusion parameters due to&#xD;
      the non-linear relationship between the concentration of contrast material and the signal&#xD;
      intensity change. MR perfusion studies also require two bolus injections of contrast agents.&#xD;
      CT perfusion is a widely available and reliable technique which can give absolute&#xD;
      quantification of perfusion parameters with a single acquisition and single bolus of a&#xD;
      contrast agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis- CT perfusion in high grade cerebral gliomas can predict survival irrespective of&#xD;
      the pathological grade and irrespective of the treatment given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives: Conduct a prospective study in a larger cohort of patients with high&#xD;
      grade cerebral gliomas to assess the utility of CT perfusion and compare this with&#xD;
      demographic factors, tumour grade and treatment for estimating prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research design: This prospective cohort study will be done over a period of 2 years at QE II&#xD;
      Health Sciences Centre, Infirmary Site. All patients, presenting with a newly detected brain&#xD;
      lesion likely to be high grade cerebral glioma either on CT or MRI of the brain, will be&#xD;
      asked to participate in this study. Pregnant patients or those with impaired renal function&#xD;
      will be excluded from the study. Informed consent will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 100 new patients with cerebral glioma present to our brain tumour clinic every&#xD;
      year. Our intent is to recruit at least 50 patients with high grade cerebral glioma each year&#xD;
      for 2 consecutive years. Each patient will undergo a single CT perfusion scan before&#xD;
      undergoing any biopsy or surgical resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT perfusion technique- The CT perfusion scan will be performed on a 128 slice multi-detector&#xD;
      CT scanner (Somatom Definition Flash, Siemens). CT perfusion imaging will be performed at the&#xD;
      time of routine preoperative neuronavigation imaging. A non-contrast CT head scan will be&#xD;
      acquired to localize the tumour before obtaining a perfusion scan. Four 5 mm thick slices&#xD;
      with matrix size of 512x512 will be selected at the level of the tumour. Multiple images will&#xD;
      be acquired at each levels starting 5 sec after the injection of 50 cc of non-ionic iodinated&#xD;
      contrast media (Omnipaque 300) at a rate of 4 cc/sec. The acquisition parameters will be 80&#xD;
      kVp and 100 mA. The images will be acquired every second for a total of 110 sec. The images&#xD;
      will be sent to a separate post-processing work station and the post- processing will be&#xD;
      performed using the CT perfusion software (Siemens). Two CT perfusion parameters (cerebral&#xD;
      blood volume and permeability surface area product) will be calculated using multiple regions&#xD;
      of interest in the areas of tumour showing the highest perfusion values. Another region of&#xD;
      interest will be placed in the contralateral normal looking white matter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will undergo biopsy or surgery and histopathological examination of the tissue as&#xD;
      per standard of care in our hospital. The perfusion parameters will be correlated with the&#xD;
      grade of glioma on pathology. The patient will receive adjuvant treatment as per the&#xD;
      institutional standard of care and will be followed clinically as per standard of care. The&#xD;
      perfusion parameters will be then correlated with the survival of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis- Perfusion parameters will be compared between glioma and normal brain tissue&#xD;
      and between different grades of gliomas using a Student 2-sample test. A Cox regression&#xD;
      analysis with proportional hazards will be used to determine the relationship between overall&#xD;
      survival and perfusion parameters. Kaplan-Meier survival curves will be drawn to demonstrate&#xD;
      the relationship between perfusion parameters and overall survival in patients. A p value of&#xD;
      less than 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expectations and Relevance of the proposed research&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CT perfusion will help in preoperative characterization of high grade cerebral gliomas&#xD;
           and their level of aggressiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perfusion parameters will help in predicting the prognosis(irrespective of grade of&#xD;
           tumour and treatment given) of the patients with high grade cerebral glioma. This may&#xD;
           help in targeting aggressive therapy to patients with predicted longer survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In patients with predicted shorter survival, the perfusion parameters may direct future&#xD;
           research on new therapeutic targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible pitfalls and possible solutions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Radiation exposure from CT perfusion- These patients undergo radiotherapy as part of&#xD;
           their treatment, which will have significantly higher radiation dose compared to CT&#xD;
           perfusion. Radiation dose from CT perfusion is equivalent to that of 2 head CT scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Potential kidney toxicity of iodinated dye- Only 50 cc of CT dye will be used, which is&#xD;
           smaller compared to the regular dose for enhanced CT scan. Patients with compromised&#xD;
           renal function will be excluded from our study.&#xD;
