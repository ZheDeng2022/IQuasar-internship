      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of BOTOX® (OnabotulinumtoxinA) on the&#xD;
      number of headache days in patients with New Daily Persistent Headache (NDPH). NDPH is a&#xD;
      benign form of chronic daily headache that comes in two forms: one that resolves on its own&#xD;
      after months to years, or one that is difficult to treat and does not respond to preventive&#xD;
      or abortive medications. Some patients experience migrainous features such as nausea,&#xD;
      vomiting, photophobia, or phonophobia. BOTOX®, a treatment approved for chronic migraine,&#xD;
      will be injected into specific muscles of the head and neck area by your study doctor, to&#xD;
      evaluate its effectiveness in reducing or relieving NDPH days or severity. BOTOX has not been&#xD;
      approved for NDPH and this is the first time it will be used for treatment of NDPH. All&#xD;
      participants in this study will only receive BOTOX® and no other study drug.&#xD;

    <description>155 units of OnabotulinumtoxinA, will be injected into 31 sites in the head and neck every 12 weeks for a total of 24 weeks using a sterile 30-gauge, 0.5 inch needle as 0.1 mL (5 Units) injections per each site. Injections will be divided across seven specific head/neck muscle areas (corrugator, procerus, frontalis, temporalis, suboccipital, splenius capitus and medial/lateral occipital, and trapezius).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects aged 18 or older, male or female of any race with the diagnosis of NDPH meeting&#xD;
        International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-2) criteria will be included in&#xD;
        the study. The criteria is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A. Persistent headache fulfilling criteria B and C B. Distinct and clearly remembered&#xD;
        onset, with pain becoming continuous and unremitting within 24 hours C. Present for &gt;3&#xD;
        months D. Not better accounted for by another ICHD-3 diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Those with relevant physical or psychological illness, particularly conditions that&#xD;
             might put them at risk if exposed to OnabotulinumtoxinA (myasthenia gravis,&#xD;
             Eaton-Lambert syndrome, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or any other neuromuscular&#xD;
             disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Diagnosis of other primary/secondary headache disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Psychiatric disorders that could interfere with study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects who abuse drugs, including headache treatments and alcohol (DSM IV criteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Those allergic to compounds similar to the study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Those who are pregnant or breastfeeding, or who do not use adequate contraceptive&#xD;
             methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Those who have had any prior exposure to any botulinum toxin serotype.&#xD;
