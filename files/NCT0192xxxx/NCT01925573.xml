  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol is designed to generate and provide preliminary data to determine the safety&#xD;
      and activity of combination therapy using tumor treating fields (TTFields;&#xD;
      Optune(NovoTTF-100A); Novocure, Haifa, Israel), a novel FDA-approved therapy utilizing&#xD;
      alternating electric fields to inhibit tumor cell growth, along with bevacizumab (Avastin;&#xD;
      Genentech, San Francisco, CA), a humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits vascular&#xD;
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy, a&#xD;
      highly-focal abbreviated course of brain irradiation, in the treatment of patients with&#xD;
      bevacizumab-naive recurrent GBM. Each of these individual therapies, and also several&#xD;
      combinations in doublets, has already demonstrated safety and efficacy but prospective&#xD;
      clinical data for the concurrent combination of all three therapies are lacking.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The combination of Optune(NovoTTF) with the active regimen of bevacizumab and&#xD;
      hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy bases the addition of an effective new treatment&#xD;
      in the setting of a safe regimen with favorable survival reports. To date, no clinical data&#xD;
      are available on the interaction of concomitant tumor treating fields with radiation therapy&#xD;
      either with or without bevacizumab. TTF and radiation both have the potential to enhance the&#xD;
      other's therapeutic ratio though synergistic mechanisms of action. The addition of&#xD;
      bevacizumab to this regimen has both therapeutic and improved-toxicity implications. A trial&#xD;
      combining Optune with the proven regimen of HFSRT and bevacizumab for recurrent glioblastoma&#xD;
      affords an avenue to demonstrate safety in a population who may more readily derive a benefit&#xD;
      from novel multimodality therapy and explore the potential for synergistic effect. The&#xD;
      endpoint of efficacy would clearly need to be more definitively addressed in a future&#xD;
      categorical trial, which would be the logical positive outcome of this pilot study.&#xD;
