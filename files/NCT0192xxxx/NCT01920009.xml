      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the United Kingdom(UK), about 838,000 men and 394,000 women have had a myocardial&#xD;
      infarction (MI) and will need secondary prevention medications. Longterm adherence to&#xD;
      secondary prevention therapies remains poor, nonadherence to medication in MI patients ranges&#xD;
      from 13-60%(1). Studies show that approximately one fourth of cardiac patients do not refill&#xD;
      their cardiac medications (2). Strategies to tackle the burden of non adherence could involve&#xD;
      pharmacy care and The New Medicine Service (which is a service provided by community&#xD;
      pharmacists to help patients on long term medications for chronic diseases) with a&#xD;
      motivational interview incorporated as part of the counselling session of a community&#xD;
      pharmacist. Communication of health providers with patients and between health providers&#xD;
      could also be an important strategy to improve adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular disease is high in all ethnic groups as well as in the general population;&#xD;
      however it is the South Asians who have the highest prevalence of coronary heart disease&#xD;
      (CHD) (3). In addition, South Asians develop CHD at a younger age, often before the age of 40&#xD;
      years (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is to investigate the feasibility and potential impact of a pharmacy care&#xD;
      intervention involving motivational interviews and referral to the New Medicine Service in&#xD;
      coronary heart disease patients on adherence to secondary prevention medication and on&#xD;
      outcomes of coronary heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed as a prospective, controlled feasibility/pilot, intervention study. The&#xD;
      study has two phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the intervention phase a total of 200 coronary heart disease patients discharged from the&#xD;
      London Chest Hospital will be enrolled into the study and followed up for one year.&#xD;
      Pharmacies from up to six London Boroughs will be invited to take place in the study.&#xD;
      Pharmacies will be randomised using a table of random numbers into intervention site or&#xD;
      control site. The pharmacists working in the intervention pharmacies will be invited for&#xD;
      training on the delivery of the intervention and on motivational interviewing. The&#xD;
      intervention will be performed by community pharmacists. Recruitment of patients will take&#xD;
      place in the hospital. In the interview phase 20 patients from South Asian backgrounds will&#xD;
      be invited for a telephone interview to study the effect of their beliefs and cultural&#xD;
      backgrounds in regards to their adherence to cardiac medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure is self report adherence with coronary artery disease medication&#xD;
      employing a standard validated measure. Secondary outcomes are blood pressure and LDL-C (low&#xD;
      density lipoprotein cholesterol) in addition to data regarding the feasibility of the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both quantitative and qualitative data analysis will be performed.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention:&#xD;
The patient will be invited by the community pharmacist for two consultations the first 2 weeks after discharge and the second after 3 months.&#xD;
The intervention group consultation:&#xD;
Community pharmacy consultation around 2 weeks The consultation will take place in the pharmacy a face to face consultation for 20 minutes including; Motivational interview session, the pharmacists will incorporate the key motivational interview skills in their consultation &quot;Express empathy, develop discrepancy, role with resistance, support self efficacy&quot;.&#xD;
The sessions will aim to develop a partnership between the pharmacist with the patient and exchange information to facilitate an informed decision. Furthermore both the pharmacist and the patient will negotiate behaviour and reach an agreement. The goal is to access motivation and elicit commitment to change behaviour &quot;in this case would be adherence to life saving medication&quot;</description>
