    <textblock>
      This study was conducted to develop biomarkers of tobacco effect that would indicate&#xD;
      potential harm related to tobacco consumption. To gain a better understanding of chronic&#xD;
      effects of tobacco consumption, this cross-sectional clinical study enrolled generally&#xD;
      healthy, adult male consumers of cigarettes (SMK), moist snuff (MSC), and no tobacco products&#xD;
      (NTC).&#xD;

      This single site, three-group (healthy, adult male smokers (SMK), moist snuff consumers&#xD;
      (MSC), and non-tobacco consumers (NTC), single-blind, cross-sectional study, included one&#xD;
      overnight confinement of study subjects for Test Visit (Visit #3). No lifestyle changes were&#xD;
      required, inclusive of tobacco habits. In addition to the Screening Visit (Visit #1), two&#xD;
      other visits (Acceptance Visit [Visit #2] and a Test Visit [Visit #3]) were conducted at the&#xD;
      clinical study site.&#xD;
