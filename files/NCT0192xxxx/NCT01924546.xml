  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a large body of evidence from adult populations suggesting cognition in adults is&#xD;
      affected by hydration status. The few studies conducted in the global North in populations of&#xD;
      schoolchildren indicate that drinking water has an impact on pupil performance on basic&#xD;
      cognitive tasks. No studies assessing the impact of dehydration and cognition in&#xD;
      schoolchildren have been published in the global South, where access to water is the poorest&#xD;
      and dehydration prevalence is likely higher. Our group previously carried out research on&#xD;
      this topic in Mali, and will build upon findings from that work with this trial. This study&#xD;
      will examine the effect of drinking supplementary water during the school day on hydration&#xD;
      status and on cognitive test scores in schoolchildren in Zambia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that providing supplemental water will result in a decrease in&#xD;
      prevalence of dehydration in the study group and will result in an improved performance on&#xD;
      cognitive test scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected from up to four purposively-selected schools in the region of Zambia&#xD;
      where this study is taking place, from up to a total of 400 children. At each school pupils&#xD;
      in grades 3-6 will be eligible for recruitment, dependent upon their understanding of&#xD;
      research instructions. Research staff will explain the study to pupils at the school and&#xD;
      individually request informed oral assent for participation. A waiver of parental consent for&#xD;
      pupil interviews will be secured from the Ministry of Education. At each school, school&#xD;
      directors will be asked to sign in loco parentis (&quot;in the place of parent&quot;) on behalf of the&#xD;
      pupil participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children that assent to participate in the study will be randomly allocated to the&#xD;
      intervention or control group. In the intervention group, study participants will receive&#xD;
      supplementary water in the morning. In the control group, study participants will receive&#xD;
      supplementary water in the afternoon. Testing procedures in both groups is identical and will&#xD;
      include a five-minute interview, two cognitive testing sessions of 45 minutes each, and&#xD;
      collection of two urine samples during the day. None of these activities collect personal&#xD;
      data or identifiers, and the urine sample will not be stored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data collection will occur at the school and will be conducted by trained local&#xD;
      enumerators. There are no risks to participation other than a small amount of class time&#xD;
      missed by pupils, and great efforts will be made to minimize time outside of class.&#xD;

      Background and Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of improved water access on the cognitive&#xD;
      performance and mood of primary school children in Zambia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a considerable body of research assessing links between dehydration to reduction in&#xD;
      cognitive ability and mood, but few of these studies involve children and only one such study&#xD;
      has taken place outside of Europe. UNICEF estimates that only 47% of schools in low-income&#xD;
      settings have access to any water during the day. Emory researchers have recently quantified&#xD;
      the impact of improved water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) access in school on health and&#xD;
      education measures, and have carried out research on cognition and dehydration in Zambia. A&#xD;
      better understanding of the impact of water intake on hydration has importance for the&#xD;
      growing number of school-based WASH interventions in developing countries, not only for&#xD;
      purposes of pure scientific knowledge but also for advocacy from donors and national&#xD;
      governments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To this purpose, the investigators have identified the following objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Refine a battery of cognitive tests for children in low-income settings and quantify the&#xD;
           practice effect of repeated testing;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the levels of dehydration among children in Zambia;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quantify the effect of improved water access on hydration status and cognition; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare different field hydration assessment techniques for accuracy and ease of use&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study significance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected through this research will contribute new evidence for use in school WASH&#xD;
      intervention programming and international advocacy, as well as provide significant and&#xD;
      groundbreaking evidence for improving water quantity in schools. There is an increasing body&#xD;
      of evidence of the impact of improved school WASH conditions on reduced school absence,&#xD;
      parasitic infection, and diarrheal disease. However, the precise mechanisms of improved&#xD;
      educational attainment have yet to be fully explored. Linking drinking water availability&#xD;
      directly to cognitive skills would provide one such explanatory mechanism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      School inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will involve children in grades 3-6 attending primary schools in Zambia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection activities will take place at up to four primary schools. Paper cognitive&#xD;
      tests and questionnaires will be administered by research staff to pupils inside of the&#xD;
      classroom, under the supervision of the classroom instructor. Surveys and taking of informed&#xD;
      assent will be conducted in a private space outside of the classroom.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures for subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection procedures will be identical on each day of data collection and will follow&#xD;
      the general schedule below, which may be slightly modified to account for specific school&#xD;
      schedules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Morning (*Denotes Day 1 activities only)&#xD;
&#xD;
      7:30 - 8:00 Class description of the study* (Group setting) 8:00 - 8:45 Pupil assent&#xD;
      process*, screening*, interview, urine sample collection (One-by-one).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Afternoon&#xD;
&#xD;
      2:00 - 2:30 Urine sample collection (One-by-one) 2:30-3:15 Cognitive testing + self-report&#xD;
      scales (Group setting)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection activities&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pupil interview. The pupil interview will contain questions on drinking and eating habits at&#xD;
      school and at home. Pupils will be excused from class to complete the interview one at a&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine sample collection. Pupils will be asked to provide one urine sample in the morning and&#xD;
      one urine sample in the afternoon on the day of data collection. Pupils will be provided with&#xD;
      a urine sample container marked with a unique identifier, and given instructions on how to&#xD;
      collect the sample. They will return the sample to study staff, who will assess hydration on&#xD;
      site and then dispose of the sample. If there is no latrine available on site, a private&#xD;
      location where pupils provide a sample will be set up. Pupils will always be allowed to&#xD;
      provide the sample alone. Study staff will provide water and soap for handwashing so pupils&#xD;
      can wash their hands after giving the urine sample. In the morning, the urine sample will be&#xD;
      collected at the start of the school day. In the afternoon, the urine sample will be&#xD;
      collected immediately prior to commencing cognitive testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive tests + self-report scales. Cognitive tests will be paper-based and will be&#xD;
      administered in a group setting in the classroom by trained study enumerators. Schoolteachers&#xD;
      and administrators will be asked to leave the classroom during the testing period. Each pupil&#xD;
      will be provided with a booklet containing a set of cognitive tests and self- assessment&#xD;
      scales of thirst, mood, and perceived difficulty. Cognitive tests and self- assessment scales&#xD;
      will be administered once in the morning and once in the afternoon by study staff. Total&#xD;
      testing time for the session is estimated to be 45 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hydration status measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hydration status will be measured through urinalysis using three methods: urine specific&#xD;
      gravity, urine color, and self-reported thirst. The urine sample will be used assess urine&#xD;
      specific gravity and color on site. Study staff will record measurements and then discard the&#xD;
      sample. Pupils will self-report thirst twice on the day of testing (morning and afternoon)&#xD;
      using a scale contained within the cognitive testing booklet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive test performance measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive performance will be assessed through a series of seven simple tests assessing a&#xD;
      broad range of cognitive skills, adapted from past research that has been carried out in&#xD;
      children in Israel, the United Kingdom, and Mali. All cognitive assessments will be adapted&#xD;
      specifically for the Zambian context prior to data collection, and local enumerators will be&#xD;
      trained on the administration of these tests. The investigators will collaborate with&#xD;
      implementing partners to translate test instructions into local languages as needed and&#xD;
      pre-test to ensure tools are appropriate for the study context. All tests will be paper-based&#xD;
      tests and will be scored manually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks to participation&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are minimal risks to participation in this study. The biggest risk of participation is&#xD;
      lost class time. Participation in the study will not subject participants to any excess risk&#xD;
      other than two interruptions of class time between 30-45 minutes each, a single interruption&#xD;
      of 5 minutes to complete the individual interview, and the time it takes to provide two urine&#xD;
      samples. All activities have been designed to minimize time taken away from class&#xD;
      instruction, and all efforts will be made not to cause other disruptions. Study staff will&#xD;
      ensure that head teachers, other teachers, and pupil participants all fully understand that&#xD;
      performance on cognitive tests does not affect their grade, and that urine samples will be&#xD;
      discarded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Response booklets will be stored in a locked office, and data will be entered into a secure&#xD;
      database. No personal identifying information will be kept with the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits to subject or future benefits&#xD;
&#xD;
      The only direct benefit of participation in this study is that all participants will be&#xD;
      provided with drinking water during one school day. There are no other direct benefits to&#xD;
      participants other than knowing that information gained from this study will contribute to&#xD;
      knowledge about the educational and health impacts of improved WASH in schools. The&#xD;
      information will be shared with local stakeholders for potential use as an advocacy tool so&#xD;
      that future programs in this and other areas can build upon the work that is done in this&#xD;
      program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from surveys, cognitive tests, and urine samples will be entered into a&#xD;
      password-protected excel database. The database will be exported as the appropriate&#xD;
      statistical analysis software file. Paired t-tests will be conducted to compare change in&#xD;
      test score from baseline and follow-up between different groups (e.g., water vs. no water;&#xD;
      dehydrated vs. hydrated).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management and monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial does not entail a medical intervention of any kind; therefore, a typical data&#xD;
      safety and monitoring plan is not necessary. Study staff will be instructed to monitor any&#xD;
      unforeseen situations that suggest an increase in risk to participants and immediately inform&#xD;
      the study manager so that a decision can be made on how to mitigate those risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pupils will be assigned a unique identifier at the start of data collection. Stickers with&#xD;
      this identifier will be placed on all pupil testing materials. A list linking identifiers to&#xD;
      pupils will be created to assist data collection logistics during the course of the data&#xD;
      collection period; however, this list will be disposed of after the data collection period is&#xD;
      ended. No personal identifying information will be collected as part of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No personal identifiers will be kept in the database. All samples will be destroyed before&#xD;
      leaving the study site and no samples will be banked as part of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      A waiver of parental consent for pupil data collection will be secured from the government&#xD;
      authority body such as the Ministry of Education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the local setting, a signed consent will also be obtained from the school management&#xD;
      committee (SMC), or in its absence, from the school director.&#xD;
&#xD;
      School directors and SMC chairpersons would sign the in loco parentis form for up to 150&#xD;
      pupils at each school. This form will be signed at the first visit, and will serve as consent&#xD;
      for all subsequent visits. One in loco parentis forms will be collected from each school,&#xD;
      with up to four total being collected for this study (one for each of the four schools).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All pupil subjects in the classes selected to participate in the study will be read a&#xD;
      complete informed oral assent script as a group prior to any data collection by a trained&#xD;
      staff member. The staff member will then call the pupils outside of the class one by one and&#xD;
      ask if they have any questions about the explanation that was given in class, and answer any&#xD;
      questions they may have. They will then ask if the pupil assents, and record assent on the&#xD;
      list of pupils. While the study will be explained to the class as a group, the actual pupil&#xD;
      assent will be taken in this private setting so that there is no appearance of coercion from&#xD;
      classmates or teachers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a pupil assents, the study staff member will commence with the screening test. If the&#xD;
      pupil passes the test, the study staff will administer the pupil questionnaire. Once the&#xD;
      questionnaire is complete, the pupil will be given a collection cup and asked to provide a&#xD;
      sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral assent has been chosen rather than written due to varying levels of literacy at the&#xD;
      school as well as a desire to minimize paperwork that contains participants' names.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A maximum of 150 assents will be recorded at each study school, with a maximum of 400 total&#xD;
      pupil assents recorded over the course of the study.&#xD;
