      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Some people have a mutation in the C9ORF72 gene that causes amyotrophic lateral sclerosis&#xD;
      (ALS) or frontotemporal dementia (FTD). The mutation causes a small piece of DNA to repeat&#xD;
      itself thousands of times. The C9ORF gene mutation mostly occurs in families. In those&#xD;
      families, some persons have ALS and others have FTD. Occasionally the C9ORF gene mutation&#xD;
      occurs in persons without a family history. Researchers want to understand how this gene&#xD;
      causes different diseases. They will study how symptoms caused by the C9ORF gene develop and&#xD;
      change over time. They will measure symptoms that occur in ALS and in FTD. In particular,&#xD;
      they will measure strength, ability to move, thinking, and memory. They will also see if&#xD;
      other tests are associated with progression of disease. These tests, called biomarkers, may&#xD;
      help detect or measure C9ORF72 disease in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To understand how symptoms change over time in people with mutations in a gene called&#xD;
      C9ORF72, which causes ALS and FTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Adults over age 18 who have this genetic mutation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have up to 4 in-person visits and 3 telephone interviews over 3 years.&#xD;
           Each in-person visit may take place over several days. They may be either inpatient or&#xD;
           outpatient visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At each visit, participants will undergo a series of brain, language, and behavior&#xD;
           tests. These will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. This uses magnets, radio waves, and&#xD;
           computers to produce detailed pictures of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collecting spinal fluid. The clinician will make the participant s back numb and then&#xD;
           insert a needle to collect fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;TAB&gt;- Blood samples will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;TAB&gt;- Participants will be asked to perform several language and movement tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;TAB&gt;- Small skin samples will be taken on one visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Between visits, participants will answer questions about their health over the phone 3&#xD;
      times.&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to characterize the natural history of disease in&#xD;
      patients who carry a repeat expansion in the C9ORF72 gene, which causes amyotrophic lateral&#xD;
      sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). The secondary objective is to assess&#xD;
      whether candidate biomarkers correlate with disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      62 persons with a documented repeat expansion in C9ORF72 gene who have ALS, ALS-FTD, or FTD&#xD;
      or who are carriers of the gene mutation and have a symptomatic family member.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo a structured battery of clinical and neuropsychological tests at&#xD;
      enrollment and at three follow-up visits to NIH to assess disease severity. During these&#xD;
      visits, physiological, imaging, blood, and CSF for testing of candidate biomarkers will be&#xD;
      obtained. Between visits to NIH, assessments of functional status and cognition will be&#xD;
      carried out by phone. Participants may be seen earlier than the scheduled follow-up visit or&#xD;
      at home if phone assessments indicate clinical deterioration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be three primary outcome measures, for changes in three areas of function over the&#xD;
      first six months. The primary measure of the severity of motor clinical function will be the&#xD;
      ALS Functional rating scale-revised (ALSFRS-R). The primary measure of the severity of&#xD;
      cognitive function will be changes in verbal fluency score. The primary measure of the&#xD;
      severity of behavioral dysfunction will be the caregiver assessment of the fronto-behavioral&#xD;
      index (FBI). Secondary clinical outcomes will be the forced vital capacity (FVC) and&#xD;
      survival. The correlation between primary and secondary clinical outcome measures and&#xD;
      candidate biomarkers measures will be analyzed in an exploratory fashion to determine whether&#xD;
      candidate biomarkers are predictive of disease onset or progression.&#xD;
