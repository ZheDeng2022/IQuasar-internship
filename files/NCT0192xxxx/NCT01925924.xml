  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Demineralization during orthodontic (brace) treatment is a common clinical problem leading to&#xD;
      unsightly white or brown marks on the teeth. A recent systematic review has shown little&#xD;
      evidence that current methods of delivering fluoride are effective at reducing this problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A multi-centre randomised single blinded controlled clinical trial will be conducted&#xD;
      with two parallel groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: The trial patients will be treated by eight named operators on the Specialist List&#xD;
      for Orthodontics held by the General Dental Council and who work either within the hospital&#xD;
      service or specialist orthodontic practice. The sample size calculation suggests that each&#xD;
      operator will need to treat 40 patients in the trial (approx 1 session per week) plus up to&#xD;
      10 familiarisation patients before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned trial interventions: Brackets will be bonded to all teeth in front of the first&#xD;
      permanent molars with either a resin-modified glass ionomer cement (Fuji Ortho LC) or a light&#xD;
      cured composite control (Transbond). The material to be bonded will be allocated randomly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: The two main outcome measures will be the difference in demineralization of&#xD;
      the anterior teeth before and after treatment assessed from photographs and the number of&#xD;
      debonded brackets during treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Demineralization (dental decay) around fixed appliance components has been reported to occur&#xD;
      in up to 95% of cases where brackets are bonded with composite resins. Although early lesions&#xD;
      appear clinically as opaque white or brown areas, if mineral loss continues cavitation will&#xD;
      occur. Following appliance removal, the lesions may regress or disappear but may still&#xD;
      present an aesthetic problem more than 5 years after appliance removal. Fluoride is known to&#xD;
      inhibit lesion development and to enhance remineralization following treatment.&#xD;
      Resin-modified glass ionomer cements, which release and absorb fluoride, may be used for&#xD;
      bracket bonding thereby offering the possibility of less demineralization around bonded&#xD;
      attachments. In addition, these cements appear to behave as reliably as composite in terms of&#xD;
      bracket failure rate recorded but these data are from case series rather than optimally&#xD;
      designed randomised clinical trials. A bonding agent that can behave as reliably as composite&#xD;
      and minimize unwanted enamel demineralization would be optimal; saving on restorative costs&#xD;
      that may be required should cavitation occur. From the patients perspective, subjective&#xD;
      assessment of treatment outcome is likely to be enhanced as ugly demineralised enamel white&#xD;
      lesions will be eliminated.&#xD;
