      The investigators aim with this study is to investigate the mechanisms of immune deficiency&#xD;
      in patients with heterotaxy syndrome through the use of novel biomarkers and a prospective&#xD;
      questionnaire survey documenting the burden of infectious sequelae following enrollment. It&#xD;
      is known that patients with under-active spleens (functional asplenia or hyposplenia)&#xD;
      secondary to other (non-cardiac) conditions such as Sickle Cell Disease or Inflammatory Bowel&#xD;
      Disease have a characteristic paucity of a B cell sub-class known as IgM memory B cell. This&#xD;
      specific sub-class of B cell normally matures in the spleen and in those with an improperly&#xD;
      functioning spleen a significant deficiency of this B cell class is seen on flow cytometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similarly, these same patients are noted to have increased amounts of 'junk' DNA / nuclear&#xD;
      remnant in their red cells. This is seen on microscopy as a dark particle inside the red cell&#xD;
      and is termed a Howell Jolly Body (normally less than 2% of red cells have these dark&#xD;
      particles present). Part of a functioning spleen's normal task is to rid the blood of red&#xD;
      cells that contain nuclear remnants and an under-active spleen gets behind on this task with&#xD;
      a build-up of Howell Jolly Bodies in red cells present in the bloodstream. Flow cytometry can&#xD;
      very quickly and accurately quantify Howell Jolly Bodies as well as IgM memory B cells from a&#xD;
      small (~1.5cc) sample of blood. Normal IgM memory B cell ranges are known for healthy&#xD;
      children from infancy onwards allowing interpretation of results against normative data&#xD;
      ranges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to enroll 10 patients in this pilot study who have a diagnosis of&#xD;
      heterotaxy syndrome (both asplenia and polysplenia) and to prospectively follow them after&#xD;
      obtaining the initial biomarker sample. The family will be contacted once every two weeks for&#xD;
      a period of 12 weeks and asked a series of simple questions taking approximately 5 minutes on&#xD;
      any recent infectious sequelae or symptoms. The questions will elucidate history of minor&#xD;
      illness such as low-grade fever or cough to more significant events such as admission for&#xD;
      in-patient antibiotic therapy of bacterial sepsis. Ultimately, with this pilot study, the&#xD;
      investigators hope to obtain sufficient data to support funding applications for a larger,&#xD;
      multi-center trial that will allow us to develop biomarker thresholds for future risk of&#xD;
      sepsis.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of heterotaxy syndrome, as objectively defined by visceral heterotaxy&#xD;
             (malrotation, interrupted inferior vena cava) with either documented polysplenia or&#xD;
             asplenia by radiological imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  0-12 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other known immunodeficiency or hyposplenic states (22q11, hypogammaglobulinemia,&#xD;
             sickle hemoglobinopathy, liver cirrhosis or portal hypertension, organ&#xD;
             transplantation, Fanconi syndrome, HIV or AIDS, chronic corticosteroid use, cancer,&#xD;
             chemotherapy or other immunomodulating drug exposure, Addison's disease or&#xD;
             pan-hypopituitarism, surgical splenectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Red blood cell transfusion within the last 90 days as the donated red blood cells may&#xD;
             interfere with calculation of the subject's Howell Jolly Body count. Patient&#xD;
             enrollment will be deferred until 90 days has elapsed, assuming other eligibility&#xD;
             requirements are met.&#xD;
