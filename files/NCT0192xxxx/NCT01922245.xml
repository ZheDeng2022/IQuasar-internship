  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will investigate the use of noninvasive brain stimulation in the form of tDCS&#xD;
      (transcranial direct current stimulation) in conjunction with speech-language therapy, for&#xD;
      the improvement of language production in stroke survivors with aphasia. The hypothesis is&#xD;
      that anodal tDCS and speech-language therapy will facilitate improved outcomes compared to&#xD;
      speech therapy alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aphasia, commonly defined as impairment or loss of language functions, is a frequent and&#xD;
      often chronic consequence of stroke, with detrimental effects on patient autonomy and&#xD;
      health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Although beneficial in some cases, the effectiveness&#xD;
      of behavioral therapy is often limited, and therefore new complementary treatments must be&#xD;
      developed in order to improve rehabilitation of post-stroke aphasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In most individuals, language areas in the brain are localized in the left hemisphere. After&#xD;
      stroke, there is evidence that the brain reorganizes such that either areas close to damaged&#xD;
      language areas in the Left Hemisphere, or anatomically similar areas in the Right Hemisphere,&#xD;
      are recruited to perform language tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, studies have begun to examine the effects of non-invasive brain stimulation on&#xD;
      aphasia rehabilitation. One such technique is transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS),&#xD;
      which involves administering weak electrical currents through surface electrodes on the&#xD;
      scalp. The effects can either stimulate an area, or inhibit an area of the brain. The main&#xD;
      hypothesis is that stimulating language areas in the Left Hemisphere in conjunction with&#xD;
      speech language therapy will facilitate reorganization of language-relevant areas of the&#xD;
      brain, and improve expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will compare the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)&#xD;
      activating language centers in the Left Hemisphere and sham tDCS, in right-handed individuals&#xD;
      with chronic post-stroke aphasia. This study will provide information on the effects of tDCS,&#xD;
      in conjunction with speech-language therapy, on aphasia rehabilitation.&#xD;
