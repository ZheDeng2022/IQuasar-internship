    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologic or cytologic evidence of a solid neoplasm for which no&#xD;
             standard therapy is available, or have progressed despite standard therapy, or are&#xD;
             intolerant to standard therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have evidence of recurrent, locally advanced, or metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients can either have had no prior anticancer therapy, multiple lines of either&#xD;
             prior chemotherapy/biologic therapy/experimental therapy or, if the patient has&#xD;
             anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), prior&#xD;
             crizotinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a predicted life expectancy of more than 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have presence of at least 1 lesion that is measurable or evaluable using&#xD;
             RECIST v1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have an ECOG performance score of 0, 1, or 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with central nervous system (CNS) metastases will be allowed on this study.&#xD;
             Patients may have received surgical and/or radiation treatment. The metastases must be&#xD;
             neurologically stable, on or off corticosteroids. Patients can have low level,&#xD;
             asymptomatic brain lesions that do not require surgical/radiation intervention&#xD;
             acutely. Patients with symptomatic lesions with impending neurologic compromise should&#xD;
             be appropriately treated with high dose steroids/radiation and may be re-evaluated for&#xD;
             this study when neurologically stable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have completed any prior anticancer treatment and must have recovered&#xD;
             from any acute toxicities. The period between the last dose of prior treatment and the&#xD;
             first dose of study drug treatment must be at least 1 week for radiotherapy and at&#xD;
             least 2 to 3 weeks for all other modalities of therapy including chemotherapy,&#xD;
             monoclonal antibody therapy, immunotherapy, other investigational drugs, or other&#xD;
             kinase inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other criteria apply.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has ongoing or active infection requiring parenteral antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has uncontrolled hypertension despite adequate therapy (ie, systolic blood&#xD;
             pressure higher than 150 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure higher than 90 mm Hg found&#xD;
             on 2 separate occasions separated by 1 week).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (despite therapeutic intervention) and&#xD;
             occurrence of more than 2 episodes of ketoacidosis in the 12 months prior to the first&#xD;
             dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has an active second malignancy other than curatively resected basal cell&#xD;
             carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, in situ carcinoma of the&#xD;
             cervix, or other cancers for which they are treated with curative intent, and no known&#xD;
             active disease in the 3 years prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has a primary brain tumor. Patients may have brain metastases from another&#xD;
             primary site.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has QTcF interval greater than 450 msec, has a known history of QTcF&#xD;
             prolongation, is taking medications known to prolong QTcF, or has a history of torsade&#xD;
             de pointes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has a prior ALK-inhibitor-related toxicity or any other prior&#xD;
             therapy-related acute toxicity that has not resolved prior to the first dose of study&#xD;
             drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other criteria apply.&#xD;
