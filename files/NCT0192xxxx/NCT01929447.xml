  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of OSAS is estimated at 2% and 4% for adult women and men respectively, most&#xD;
      of whom are undiagnosed and untreated. The severity of the disorder is expressed by the Apnea&#xD;
      Hypopnea Index (AHI) which is the number of Apnea/Hypopnea episodes per hours of actual sleep&#xD;
      and the Respiratory Disturbances Index (RDI) which is an extended index incorporating in&#xD;
      addition to the previous episodes also respiratory effort related arousal episodes. The high&#xD;
      cost of in-lab full night PSG, together with long waiting lists for sleep studies, have led&#xD;
      to the development of a variety of ambulatory sleep study systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the newly developed WP200 with the unified&#xD;
      probe (WP200U) compared to the currently used configuration of WP200 that uses an&#xD;
      incorporated Nonin oximetry module in the sleep lab or in the home sleep environment.&#xD;
