  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the performance and safety of the Optiflow&#xD;
      Anastomotic Connector (Optiflow) when used to facilitate the creation of autogenous&#xD;
      arteriovenous fistula (AVF) anastomoses.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigation is designed as a multi-center, prospective, single-arm, clinical study of&#xD;
      the Optiflow performance and safety in a maximum of 180 subjects which includes one (1)&#xD;
      roll-in subjects per investigator (maximum of 36 roll-in subjects). Subjects will be followed&#xD;
      at 14 days post-procedure, 42 days post-procedure, and 90 days post-procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results will be compared to a pre-established performance goal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to fifteen (15) investigational sites will participate in the investigational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary performance endpoint is the overall maturation percentage rate at 90 days.&#xD;
      Maturation is defined as an access site which achieves a diameter of greater or equal to 4 mm&#xD;
      and blood flow greater or equal t0 500 mL/min as measured via duplex ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary safety endpoint is a composite endpoint of serious adverse events known to be&#xD;
      associated with arteriovenous fistula anastomosis surgical procedures through 90 days.&#xD;
