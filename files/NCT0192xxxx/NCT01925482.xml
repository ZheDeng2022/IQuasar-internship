  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will measure the speed at which gases move between the middle-ear air-space and&#xD;
      the blood flowing through the middle-ear lining. The middle ear is a rigid biological gas&#xD;
      pocket located behind the eardrum and is filled with the same gases as in air, primarily&#xD;
      oxygen (O), nitrogen (N) and carbon dioxide (CO2), but in different proportions. The middle&#xD;
      ear is lined by a thin layer of cells overlying tissues that surround blood vessels. The&#xD;
      blood that flows through the middle-ear lining also contains these same gases but at&#xD;
      different proportions from both the atmosphere (room air) and middle ear. Because of the&#xD;
      differences in the proportions of these gases, each gas tends to flow between the middle ear&#xD;
      and blood trying to make the proportions of gases in those compartments the same. This flow&#xD;
      of gases to and from the middle ear changes the middle-ear pressure. If the middle-ear&#xD;
      pressure decreases much below the air pressure of the atmosphere, the ability to hear sounds&#xD;
      is impaired and fluid can build up in the middle ear. It is expected that each different gas&#xD;
      will move between the middle ear and blood at a different speed, but it is not known what&#xD;
      those speeds are for any of the gases. It is also expected that those speeds will be&#xD;
      different for ears that have had middle-ear disease and those that have not. In this study,&#xD;
      we will measure the speed of nitrogen, oxygen and carbon dioxide exchanges in both directions&#xD;
      between the middle ear and blood. To do this, the gas mixture in the middle ear will be&#xD;
      changed so that there is movement of only one gas for each experiment and then measure the&#xD;
      change in the amount of the gas in the middle ear. This can be done using a special&#xD;
      instrument called a mass spectrometer if there is an open, working tympanostomy (ventilation)&#xD;
      tube, a small plastic tube, in the eardrum. For all participants in this study, we will&#xD;
      conduct 6 experiments lasting about 2 hours each to measure the speed of nitrogen, oxygen and&#xD;
      carbon dioxide flow. Subjects with and without tympanostomy tubes will be recruited. Those&#xD;
      without a tube will have a tube inserted in one ear for study purposes and it will be removed&#xD;
      at the end of the study; these subjects will be followed weekly until the hole in the eardrum&#xD;
      (where the tube was) is closed.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Adequate middle ear (ME) pressure-regulation, defined as the maintenance of a total ME&#xD;
      pressure at approximately ambient levels, is required for normal hearing and to preserve ME&#xD;
      health. The mechanism of ME pressure-regulation consists of two distinct components that&#xD;
      affect total ME gas pressure: the bolus, total gradient driven exchange of gases between the&#xD;
      ME and nasopharynx during active, transient Eustachian tube (ET) openings and the passive,&#xD;
      partial-pressure gradient driven diffusive exchange of gases between the ME cavity and&#xD;
      adjacent compartments including the local blood via the ME mucosa (MEM) and environment via&#xD;
      the tympanic membrane. The basic physiology of gas transfers through the ET is well&#xD;
      established and a slow to negligible gas exchange across the normal and inflamed tympanic&#xD;
      membrane has been measured for chinchillas, cats and monkeys, and confirmed by us for humans.&#xD;
      In contrast, the characteristics of transMEM gas exchange is controversial. Mathematical&#xD;
      modeling shows that transMEM gas exchange controls the ME pressure trajectory between ET&#xD;
      openings and the relative rates of exchange for the different physiologic gases defines the&#xD;
      demand placed on the ET for ME gas resupply. Here, we empirically measure the transMEM&#xD;
      ME-to-blood and the blood-to-ME exchange constants for the physiologic gases in humans with&#xD;
      normal and inflamed MEMs. For that purpose, a total of 20 otherwise healthy adult subjects,&#xD;
      10 with no significant history of ME ear disease (Group-1) and 10 with at least 1 functional&#xD;
      ventilation tube (VT) inserted for extant ME disease (Group-2). Group-1 subjects will have VT&#xD;
      insertion under local anesthetic in the research clinic and, for all subjects, a custom-made&#xD;
      acrylic ear-plug will be fabricated and fitted with a sensor for measuring pressure, a&#xD;
      syringe for adjusting system pressure and micro-tubing to allow for periodic gas sampling&#xD;
      with composition analysis by an online mass-spectrometer. All subjects will undergo a series&#xD;
      of six transMEM gas exchange experiments, with each experiment designed to establish a&#xD;
      ME-to-blood or a blood-to-ME partial-pressure gradient for one of the 3 physiologic gases,&#xD;
      N2, O2 or CO2. During each experiment, the ear-plug will be inserted into and sealed within&#xD;
      the ear canal. The ear-plug will be attached by valves to a line leading to the&#xD;
      mass-spectrometer and to a known composition gas source, and the system (ear-plug + ME)&#xD;
      washed with a test gas specific to the experiment. Then, the ear-plug will be closed to the&#xD;
      gas source, and for the 60 to 90 minute duration of the experiment, system pressure will be&#xD;
      recorded continuously and ME gas samples will be taken at 10 minute intervals for composition&#xD;
      analysis. The data will be transformed to estimate the transMEM conductance (exchange&#xD;
      constant) for the test gas. On the last day of the experimental series, the Group-2 subjects&#xD;
      will be dismissed; Group-1 subjects will have their VT removed and then be followed weekly&#xD;
      until the tympanic membrane perforation has healed. At that time, audiometry which was&#xD;
      performed before VT insertion will be repeated. The results will be used to complete our&#xD;
      mathematical models of ME pressure-regulation as the ME transitions from health to disease.&#xD;
      These empirical data will also be used to evaluate certain hypotheses related to the&#xD;
      limitations placed on the exchange of each gas species and regarding the directional symmetry&#xD;
      of the exchange processes.&#xD;
