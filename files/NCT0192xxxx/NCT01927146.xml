    <textblock>
      By literature review, there is a clear trend towards a potential role for human epidermal&#xD;
      growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) as a negative prognostic factor in gastric cancer was shown,&#xD;
      but only in half of the analyses used multivariate statistics. Besides, For the studies in&#xD;
      the current review that have looked at the Lauren classification in relation to HER2, a&#xD;
      higher level of overexpression or amplification was found in the intestinal phenotype&#xD;
      compared to the diffuse or mixed types. As lauren classification was reported as an&#xD;
      independent prognostic factor result in favored outcomes in gastric cancer (GC), there may&#xD;
      probably be histologic bias exists when compare overall survival (OS) between HER2 statuses&#xD;
      without controlling this confounding. Similarly, patients with different disease settings&#xD;
      (early stage and advanced stage; resectable and metastatic) affect outcomes either.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will retrospectively analyze HER2 status and lauren&#xD;
      classification in 800 gastric patients who received gastrectomy in the Cancer Center of Sun&#xD;
      Yat-Sen University between January 1996 and December 2006 with formalin-fixed and paraffin-&#xD;
      embedded tumor tissue samples. To avoid potential influence by histologic classifications and&#xD;
      disease settings, the investigators assess difference in OS between HER2 positive and HER2&#xD;
      negative groups in resectable Lauren classification of GCs, and further evaluate the&#xD;
      prognostic value of HER2 status according to tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stages.&#xD;

      It's a single site, retrospective study by review of medical records and tissue testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eight hundred gastric adenocarcinoma patients with integrity medical record and regular&#xD;
      survival follow up who received gastrectomy in the Cancer Center of Sun Yat-Sen University&#xD;
      between January 1996 to December 2006 were retrospectively studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tumor tissue samples were retrospectively tested by&#xD;
      human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and Lauren classification status. Her2&#xD;
      positive was defined as: immunohistochemistry (IHC) 2+ and fluorescence in situ hybridization&#xD;
      (FISH) +; or IHC 3+.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. After HER2 status and lauren classification identifying, population used in overall&#xD;
           survival (OS) comparison between Cohort 1(HER2 positive) and Cohort 2 (negative group)&#xD;
           were carried out. According to Tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) classification, OS were to be&#xD;
           compared between cohorts by different stages.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Correlate histopathological characteristics with HER2 status and lauren classification&#xD;
           were performed in the total 800 patients. Meanwhile, independent prognostic factors&#xD;
           identification was to be confirmed in clinicopathological features, including gender&#xD;
           (male or female), age at diagnosis, tumor size (â‰¤5cm or &gt;5cm), location of primary tumor&#xD;
           (proximal or distal), histology subtypes (well + moderate differentiated adenocarcinoma&#xD;
           or poorly + signet ring cell differentiated adenocarcinoma), lauren classifications&#xD;
           (diffuse type or intestinal type or mixed type), anemia (yes or no), angiolymphatic&#xD;
           invasion (yes or no), the TNM staging system (American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)&#xD;
           7th edition), and HER2 status (negative and positive).&#xD;
