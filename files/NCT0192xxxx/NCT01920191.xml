      RATIONALE : IMA 950 is multi tumour-associated peptides (TUMAPs) vaccine, these peptides have&#xD;
      been identified on primary glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells. Poly-ICLC is a potent vaccine&#xD;
      adjuvant with broad innate and adaptive immune enhancing effects. IMA 950 and Poly-ICLC will&#xD;
      be administered to patients alongside standard primary therapy for glioblastoma. This&#xD;
      includes the alkylating drug temozolomide (TMZ). Effective vaccine-induced immune responses&#xD;
      associated with prolonged survival have been observed in glioblastoma patients during TMZ&#xD;
      adjuvant therapy, suggesting a possible synergistic effect. A second component of&#xD;
      glioblastoma standard treatment is external beam irradiation of the tumor site post-surgery.&#xD;
      As a side effect, potentially beneficial tumor-infiltrating immune cells may also be killed&#xD;
      by radiation. However, the combination of radiation with immunotherapy has been suggested to&#xD;
      be favorable both in pre-clinical models.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tolerability and safety of IMA950 adjuvanted with Poly-ICLC when given together with&#xD;
           temozolomide, using CTCAE V 4.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immunogenicity of IMA950 plus Poly-ICLC when given together with temozolomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6, 9 month progression free survival (PFS) using gadolinium enhanced MRI and clinical&#xD;
           assessment according to revised RANO criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall survival (OS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immunologic endpoints (correlation between clinical and immunological responses):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  evaluation of peptide immunogenicity by tetramer staining&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  analysis of memory, activation and homing marker expression by tetramer positive cells&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  analysis of cytokine secretion and proliferation by antigen-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  analysis of the presence of T regulatory and myeloid-derived suppressor cells&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The immunological analyses will be performed on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  cultures of skin punch biopsy at delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) site&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) if brain tissue is available at recurrence&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a monocentric, open label, one cohort, safety and immunogenicity, Phase I/II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A maximum of 16 HLA-A2 positive patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma will be enrolled&#xD;
      into the study after treatment with radiation therapy and concurrent temozolomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive the same dose of IMA950 with Poly-ICLC and follow the same&#xD;
      vaccination schedule which comprises a Vaccination Induction Phase of 4 intensive&#xD;
      vaccinations, followed by a Vaccination Maintenance Phase of five vaccinations over a longer&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Vaccination Induction Phase will start a minimum of 7 days after the final&#xD;
      radiotherapy/TMZ dose of CRT and 28 days (+7 days) prior to the first scheduled dose of&#xD;
      adjuvant TMZ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will ensure that all 4 vaccinations in the Induction Phase will be administered a week&#xD;
      after immunosuppressive therapy (i.e. combined radiotherapy and temozolomide) and will finish&#xD;
      a week prior to the start of adjuvant TMZ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two Phases :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induction phase, patient receive the first 4 doses of Poly ICLC mixed with IMA 950 Peptide&#xD;
      based vaccine (subcutaneously or IM) on days 1,8,15, and 21 in absence of unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity or disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintenance Phase, patient receive Poly ICLC mixed with IMA 950 Peptide based vaccine (SC or&#xD;
      IM) on day 21 of each adjuvant temozolomide cycle in absence unacceptable toxicity or disease&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunomonitoring assessments will be performed at 8 time points with blood samples collection&#xD;
      and one DTH site analysis(after vaccination 5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brain MRI will be performed every two months for disease assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      N.B. :&#xD;
&#xD;
      An amendment has been accepted by Swissmedic and Local Ethics committee on september 2014,&#xD;
      after suboptimal immunomonitoring preliminary assessments, the schedule of administration has&#xD;
      been changed in order to improve the immunogenicity of the vaccine, as follows :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  injection of mixed peptides and adjuvant Poly ICLC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  4 vaccinations in the induction phase instead of 6&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  one site of injection (thigh)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  two arms for the next 10 patients to be included that will be equally divided in 2&#xD;
           groups : one group will be vaccinated subcutaneously and the other intramuscularly.&#xD;
