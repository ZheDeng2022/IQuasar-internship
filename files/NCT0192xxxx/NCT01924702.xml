      The purpose of this study is to determine if non-invasive electrical brain stimulation can&#xD;
      enhance the outcome of intensive language therapy in chronic aphasia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Given the increasing average&#xD;
      lifespan worldwide, the incidence and prevalence of patients with stroke will dramatically&#xD;
      increase in the future. One of the most frequent and devastating conditions after stroke is&#xD;
      aphasia, which affects language production and comprehension. High-frequent intensive&#xD;
      speech-and-language therapy is currently the treatment of choice in chronic aphasia. However,&#xD;
      despite its general effectiveness, treatment effect sizes are only low to moderate. Thus,&#xD;
      there is a pressing need to explore novel training-adjuvant therapies to enhance treatment&#xD;
      efficacy. Moreover, very little is known about the neurobiology of treatment-induced recovery&#xD;
      in chronic aphasia. This is the prerequisite to improve existing and/or develop new treatment&#xD;
      paradigms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, in the present project the investigators aim to assess whether the outcome of intensive&#xD;
      language training can be enhanced by adjuvant non-invasive brain stimulation. They will be&#xD;
      using anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (atDCS) that has previously been shown&#xD;
      to enhance (a) language and motor learning in healthy subjects and (b) motor recovery in&#xD;
      stroke patients. Specifically, in a longitudinal group comparison design, two matched groups&#xD;
      of patients with chronic anomia will receive two weeks of intensive language training with or&#xD;
      without atDCS. Treatment effects will be assessed immediately after the two week intervention&#xD;
      period and several months after the end of the training. The Investigators will also use&#xD;
      functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to elucidate language network&#xD;
      changes in the two groups.&#xD;
