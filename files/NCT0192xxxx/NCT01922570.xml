      Enteral nutrition (EN) is the first choice route for nutritional support in ICU patients with&#xD;
      a functioning digestive tract. Nevertheless, EN alone is often associated with digestive&#xD;
      intolerance, including diarrhoea. In case of diarrhoea, EN is often reduced or discontinued,&#xD;
      resulting in insufficient energy and protein intakes and increase complications rate in ICU&#xD;
      patients. Diarrhoea is more frequent in ICU patients receiving EN that in those without EN or&#xD;
      on Parenteral nutrition (PN). This difference is likely to be related to the level of EN&#xD;
      administration needed to optimize the coverage of nutritional needs at a time when the gut&#xD;
      has reduced absorptive capacity. Diarrhoea is suspected to have a negative economic impact on&#xD;
      global cost, because the management of patients with diarrhoea is time-consuming for the&#xD;
      nurses and all medical staff, it requires investigations (water and electrolytes balances,&#xD;
      microbiology investigations, etc.) and treatments (anti-diarrhoeal drugs, antibiotics, etc).&#xD;
      However, the economic impact of diarrhoea related to EN or the combination of EN and PN has&#xD;
      never been evaluated in the ICU setting.&#xD;

      Rationale: Enteral nutrition (EN) is the first choice route for nutritional support in ICU&#xD;
      patients with a functioning digestive tract (1). Nevertheless, EN alone is often associated&#xD;
      with digestive intolerance, including diarrhoea (2,3). In case of diarrhoea, EN is often&#xD;
      reduced or discontinued, resulting in insufficient energy and protein intakes (4) and&#xD;
      increase complications rate in ICU patients (5-7). Diarrhoea is more frequent in ICU patients&#xD;
      receiving EN that in those without EN or on PN. This difference is likely to be related to&#xD;
      the level of EN administration needed to optimize the coverage of nutritional needs at a time&#xD;
      when the gut has reduced absorptive capacity. Diarrhoea is suspected to have a negative&#xD;
      economic impact on global cost, because the management of patients with diarrhoea is&#xD;
      time-consuming for the nurses and all medical staff, it requires investigations (water and&#xD;
      electrolytes balances, microbiology investigations, etc.) and treatments (anti-diarrhoeal&#xD;
      drugs, antibiotics, etc). However, the economic impact of diarrhoea related to EN or the&#xD;
      combination of EN and PN has never been evaluated in the ICU setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: We made the hypothesis that the extra cost related to the combination of EN and&#xD;
      PN prescription is compensated by the decrease in cost secondary to a reduced prevalence of&#xD;
      EN-related diarrhoea, which means that the combination of EN and PN is cost-efficient&#xD;
      strategy for optimal feeding in ICU patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is known that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  diarrhoea is more frequent in ICU patients with EN than in those without EN,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the higher the EN delivery rate, the higher the risk of diarrhoea,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the combination of EN and PN decreases the need for high EN delivery rate to fully cover&#xD;
           the patients' nutritional needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is likely that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  diarrhoea-related care costs of EN are higher than those observed in patients receiving&#xD;
           a combination of EN and PN,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  extra costs related to the combination of EN and PN prescription are compensated by the&#xD;
           decrease in costs secondary to a reduced prevalence of EN-related diarrhoe,&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine retrospectively the global prevalence of diarrhoea in all the ICU patients&#xD;
           during a three month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine prospectively the prevalence of diarrhoea in the ICU patients included in&#xD;
           the &quot;SPN study&quot; on EN alone or EN + PN. To validate this current prevalence of diarrhoea&#xD;
           by comparison to the retrospective prevalence rate in our ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine prospectively the diarrhoea-related overall costs in the patients of the&#xD;
           &quot;SPN study&quot; on EN alone or EN + PN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study endpoints: Three categories of study endpoints will be assessed: economic,&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tolerance, feeding protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Economic in Swiss francs:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Nursing time for the management of diarrhoea (changes of bed-clothes and disposable&#xD;
                nappies)and of nutritional support (time spent to prepare and administer EN and/or&#xD;
                PN solutions, introduction and maintenance of naso-gastric tube, catheters, lines,&#xD;
                etc)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Medical time for prescriptions in seconds of the investigations required by the&#xD;
                managment of diarrhoea and of the material costs: drugs (antibiotics, drugs&#xD;
                inhibiting motility, etc.), bed-clothes, gloves, disposable nappy, EN and/or PN&#xD;
                solutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gastrointestinal tolerance: Symptoms such as as diarrhoea, defined as liquid stools,&#xD;
           defined as three or more liquid stools per day, for at least 1 day, and nausea,&#xD;
           vomiting, diarrhoea, flatulence, or constipation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Feeding protocol: the route of feeding (EN versus PN), the type, quantities and&#xD;
           modalities for delivering nutrition products.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inclusion criteria: All patients already included in the &quot;SPN study&quot; receiving.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exclusion criteria: none.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Risk and benefit: The present study will not induce any change to the cares defined in&#xD;
           the &quot;SPN study&quot; protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Additional data recorded to the &quot;SPN study&quot; database:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data: Diarrhoea: number and frequency of stools for the 5 intervention days (Day 3&#xD;
      and 8) and digestive tolerance: measurements of gastric residues according to ou on-going ICU&#xD;
      protocol, frequency of nausea, vomiting, flatulence and constipation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Economic data: Time measurements for physicians activities using a chronometer:Management of&#xD;
      nutritional support, Prescription of nutritional support and micronutrients, Investigations&#xD;
      related to the management of nutritional support: upper gastrointestinal endoscopy for the&#xD;
      insertion of nasojejunal or nasogastric feeding tube or for the investigation of digestive&#xD;
      intolerance, Insertion of central venous catheter, Prescription of drugs for the management&#xD;
      of diarrhoea: antibiotics, drugs inhibiting motility, etc., Prescription of investigations&#xD;
      for the management of diarrhoea: lower gastrointestinal endoscopy, microbiology for the&#xD;
      analysis of stools, blood analysis (electrolytes, renal fucntion, etc)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cost for each item will be calculated according to the cost of manpower based on mean&#xD;
      Swiss data as previously described (8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Time measurements for nurses activities using a chronometer:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Management of nutritional support&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Preparation of nutritional support: installation of pumps, connections of bottles&#xD;
                with bags, addition of micronutrients (vitamins and trace elements) and insertion&#xD;
                of naso-gastric tube for EN&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Monitoring: calculation and setting of flow rates&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Supervision: noting all observations regarding nutritional support in patient&#xD;
                nursing file, changes of bottles and bags&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Management of diarrhoea&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Preparation of anti-diarrhoea drugs or antibiotics&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Nursing cares: cleaning, resetting of bed-clothes, wearing of disposable nappies,&#xD;
                wound-dressings The cost for each item will be calculated according to the cost of&#xD;
                manpower based on mean Swiss data as previously described (8).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Material costs&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Drugs: antibiotics, anti-diarrhoea drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Nutritional support: central venous catheters, naso-gastric tubes, cost of one day&#xD;
                IV pump utilization, cost of nutrient solutions, additive materials&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cleaning and disinfections: bed-clothes, gloves, caps, disposable nappy&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients included in the &quot;SPN study&quot; (9) will provide prospective data about the&#xD;
      association between the type of nutritional support (EN, combination of EN and PN) and the&#xD;
      occurrence of diarrhoea. We plan to complete this analysis by measuring the economic&#xD;
      criteria, as described in the paragraph 7 above. These data will allow to develop an economic&#xD;
      model to be applied to all the data acquired in the SPN study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ethics This study protocol is the addendum no 1 to our existing protocol and which is in&#xD;
           full compliance with our institution guidelines. Briefly, this extension of the protocol&#xD;
           has been approved by the Chief of the ICU before the procedure has been initiated.&#xD;
