  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-part study in patients with advanced solid tumours. Part A will investigate the&#xD;
      effect of rifampicin on the PK parameters of olaparib in patients; Part B will allow patients&#xD;
      continued access to olaparib after the PK phase and will provide additional safety data.&#xD;
