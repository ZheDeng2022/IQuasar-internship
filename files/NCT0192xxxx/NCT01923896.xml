      The proposed study represents the first attempt to systematically investigate the use of DCS&#xD;
      as an adjunct to behavioral intervention to address chronic food aversion through an&#xD;
      randomized control drug trial in children treated at the Marcus Autism Center's Pediatrics&#xD;
      Feeding Disorders Program. This pilot and feasibility study will involve a total of 16&#xD;
      participants randomly assigned to experimental conditions: behavioral intervention or&#xD;
      behavioral intervention + DCS (8 in each group). All participants will receive the same&#xD;
      behavioral protocol involving three treatment sessions per day (45 minutes in length), for a&#xD;
      total of 15 sessions across five consecutive days. In addition, participants in the&#xD;
      behavioral intervention + DCS group will receive a low dose (0.7 mg/kg) of the drug using an&#xD;
      acute dosing methodology, which has been demonstrated to produce a nearly negligible side&#xD;
      effect profile with comparable treatment outcomes to chronic dosing. Timing of dosing will&#xD;
      occur 1 hour prior to behavioral intervention, in line with prior clinical studies. Study&#xD;
      staff, with consultation from a psychiatrist, will observe administration of DCS to&#xD;
      participants by caregivers via their preferred method of formula consumption (bottle, cup, or&#xD;
      tube) in liquid form. Participants will be evaluated during each treatment session and at&#xD;
      follow-up using trained observers to collect data on mealtime behaviors, including&#xD;
      acceptance, swallowing, disruption, expulsion, and grams consumed. This type of data&#xD;
      collection is standard practice in the feeding disorders program. It is hypothesized that&#xD;
      participants who receive DCS as an adjunct to behavioral intervention will show greater&#xD;
      improvement in mealtime behaviors as reflected by these measures.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      -  Extinction of fear is thought to use similar learning mechanisms as learning or&#xD;
           conditioning of fear, and both are blocked by antagonists at the glutamatergic&#xD;
           N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. Furthermore, agonists at this site appear to&#xD;
           augment some forms of learning in animal and human trials. The process of extinction of&#xD;
           conditioned fear was initially shown to be facilitated by D-Cycloserine (DCS), an NMDA&#xD;
           agonist, given in individual doses prior to extinction training in an animal model.&#xD;
           There is growing evidence that a similar effect is found in human subjects undergoing&#xD;
           controlled exposure therapy for specific phobia. This translational research proposal&#xD;
           represents a randomized-control study with the goal of determining whether a drug that&#xD;
           acutely enhances learning in both human and animal research will facilitate the&#xD;
           extinction of fear that occurs with behavioral therapy for children with food aversion.&#xD;
           Specifically, it is proposed that a single dose of DCS, given shortly before each of 5&#xD;
           days of behavioral therapy sessions utilizing escape extinction, will significantly&#xD;
           enhance the rate of response and possibly the efficacy of treatment for pediatric food&#xD;
           aversion. To this end, the investigators propose to enroll 16 participants with food&#xD;
           aversion. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive behavioral intervention&#xD;
           alone or in combination with 0.7mg/kg DCS. Behavioral ratings and outcomes will be&#xD;
           assessed by independent assessors blind to subject condition. Participants will be&#xD;
           assessed pre-treatment and at a one month follow-up session to assess long term effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This type of combined treatment -- specific pharmacotherapeutic augmentation of&#xD;
           behavioral therapy -- would be novel in pediatric populations with food aversion and&#xD;
           would potentially be generalizable to many different forms of behavioral intervention&#xD;
           for a wide range of pediatric disorders. The potential for detrimental health outcomes&#xD;
           associated with feeding disorders, combined with their complex biopsychosocial etiology,&#xD;
           intensifies the need to identify and refine effective treatments. If this translational&#xD;
           research is successful, the ability of a relatively benign agent administered acutely&#xD;
           before a behavioral therapy session to facilitate the extinction process could have&#xD;
           important clinical, humanitarian, and economic advantages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims: The entire proposed study is designed to achieve the following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To explore whether d-cycloserine (DCS), an NMDA partial agonist, facilitates extinction&#xD;
           of food aversion in children using extinction based behavioral intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To explore whether any facilitation in extinction produced by DCS in behavioral&#xD;
           intervention evidenced within session and immediately post-treatment results in&#xD;
           long-term gains in treatment response as compared to behavioral intervention alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Research Hypotheses: The following hypotheses will be tested:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. DCS will facilitate extinction in children. It is predicted that the children who&#xD;
           receive behavioral intervention combined with 0.7mg/kg DCS will evidence more rapid&#xD;
           improvement in mealtime behavior (acceptance, swallowing, disruptions, expulsions, grams&#xD;
           consumed) than children receiving behavioral intervention alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Facilitation in therapeutic response aided by DCS will result in long-term gains. It is&#xD;
           predicted that the group of patients who receive behavioral intervention combined with&#xD;
           0.7 mg/kg DCS will evidence more improvement at the follow-up assessment as compared to&#xD;
           baseline behavior (acceptance, swallowing, disruptions, expulsions, grams consumed) than&#xD;
           the group who receives behavioral intervention alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gender and Minority Participants' Inclusion Plan. Patients of all races and ethnic groups&#xD;
      will be entered, both males and females. The investigators will recruit from the year long&#xD;
      waiting list for behavioral services at the Feeding Disorders Program. The investigators will&#xD;
      advertise via fliers at the Marcus Autism Center, as well as local pediatric and&#xD;
      gastroenterological practices in the Atlanta area. (See Flyer Info to review content of the&#xD;
      flyer). The racial composition of Atlanta is 71% white, 26% black, and 3% other (based on the&#xD;
      1990 US Census). Approximately 1% of these persons are of Hispanic origins. The gender&#xD;
      composition of Atlanta is 51% female. This study will provide free treatment, thus ensuring&#xD;
      equal opportunities for all to learn about and participate in this study. The treatment&#xD;
      setting is located in a racially diverse county (DeKalb County), is easily accessible by&#xD;
      public transportation and is wheelchair accessible. It is therefore expected that the study&#xD;
      sample will closely approximate the demographic composition of Atlanta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Behavioral Intervention: Treatment will commence following the pre-treatment assessment.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: behavioral&#xD;
      intervention alone or behavioral intervention plus medication. All participants will be&#xD;
      treated for a period of 5 consecutive days. A total of 3, 45-minute meals will be held at&#xD;
      regularly scheduled times (e.g., 9:00 a.m., 10:30 a.m., and 12:00 p.m.) each day for a total&#xD;
      of 15 meals throughout treatment. Trained feeding therapists from the Marcus Autism Center's&#xD;
      Pediatric Feeding Disorders Program will conduct sessions in treatment rooms equipped with&#xD;
      one-way mirrors and an adjacent observation room to allow caregivers to watch all treatment&#xD;
      sessions. Behavioral intervention targeting severe feeding disorders involves the combination&#xD;
      of escape extinction and antecedent manipulation of food presentation to lessen the aversive&#xD;
      quality of the meal. This allows treatment to address the consequences maintaining food&#xD;
      refusal in the least restrictive environment while ameliorating possible side effects&#xD;
      associated with extinction procedures. Please refer to the nonremoval of the spoon +&#xD;
      representation + redistribution (NRS + REP + RED) protocol for a detailed example the&#xD;
      proposed treatment. Data will be collected during each meal and all behavioral treatment&#xD;
      sessions will be video recorded for the purpose of ensuring accurate protocol implementation&#xD;
      and assessing reliability. Caregivers will be trained on the protocol during the last session&#xD;
      of treatment to promote transition of the protocol into the home setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medication: As described above, the investigators will compare behavioral intervention alone&#xD;
      to behavioral intervention plus 0.7mg/kg DCS. Patients will be instructed to take the&#xD;
      medication under the supervision of study personnel one hour prior to the first treatment&#xD;
      session. A placebo will also be given to participants in the behavior only condition using a&#xD;
      similar method of administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and Plan: The proposed design is to randomly assign 16 participants with food aversion&#xD;
      to behavioral intervention or behavioral intervention plus 0.7mg/kg DCS to be taken acutely&#xD;
      one hour prior to the onset of the first treatment session each day. All participants will&#xD;
      receive three, 45 minute treatment sessions per day for a period of five days. Study&#xD;
      medications will be administered in the clinic supervised by study personnel to ensure&#xD;
      compliance. The investigators will be using the Children's Healthcare of Atlanta&#xD;
      Investigational Drug Service (IDS) to provide both drug and placebo. Participants will be&#xD;
      assessed pre-treatment and at one month following the termination of treatment by a blinded&#xD;
      independent assessor.&#xD;
