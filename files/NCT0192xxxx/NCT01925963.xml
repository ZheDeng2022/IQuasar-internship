  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the research study is to collect information about brain function and&#xD;
      structure among active duty military personnel or civilians who are healthy. Researchers want&#xD;
      to develop a database from normal volunteers that will be used in comparison with a similar&#xD;
      database from active duty military with post-concussive syndrome (PCS) from a mild traumatic&#xD;
      brain injury. Findings from this study may be used to design larger studies that will&#xD;
      evaluate whether hyperbaric oxygen treatments actually improve PCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will undergo numerous tests to assess physical, mental, and&#xD;
      intellectual health and how they might change over time. Participants will wear heart and&#xD;
      activity monitors, undergo brain imaging, provide blood and urine for laboratory testing, and&#xD;
      have vision, hearing, balance, and muscle function tests. They will also complete a number of&#xD;
      questionnaires and interviews. This battery of tests will be repeated twice more over the&#xD;
      course of 6 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study will develop a database from normal healthy participants&#xD;
      for the same outcomes used in a program of studies of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) vs. sham&#xD;
      control in participants with persistent post-concussive symptoms. This study will&#xD;
      characterize the distribution of responses and change in responses over time for each of the&#xD;
      outcomes and will examine associations between measures within a given normal participant and&#xD;
      across participant characteristics such as age and gender. It will evaluate the test-retest&#xD;
      reliability of a series of assessments anticipated for use in the primary, secondary, and&#xD;
      exploratory outcomes of this program of studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary purpose of this study is to compare normative values to results from randomized&#xD;
      exploratory studies of HBO2 vs. sham control in participants with persistent post-concussive&#xD;
      symptoms. Also, investigators will examine relationships between outcome measures from normal&#xD;
      participants (with respect to clinical equivalence, participant burden, and risk) and compare&#xD;
      to associations observed in other studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, normal, healthy, non-brain injured civilians and military participants (active&#xD;
      or inactive) will undergo a battery of outcome assessments at defined test intervals to&#xD;
      replicate the assessment battery used in a program of studies investigating the safety of&#xD;
      HBO2 in patients with post-concussive symptoms following mild traumatic brain injury (TBI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned comprehensive assessments will obtain robust neuropsychological, physiological,&#xD;
      and neuroimaging data. Other evaluations will include laboratory testing and evaluations of&#xD;
      the auditory, vestibular, and visual systems. Neuroimaging (magnetic resonance imaging and&#xD;
      computed tomography angiography) will be assessed in participants at baseline and 6 months.&#xD;
      Neurological function and electroencephalography (EEG) will be assessed at baseline only. All&#xD;
      other in-person outcome measures will be assessed in participants at baseline, at 13 weeks,&#xD;
      and 6 months.&#xD;
