    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the bioequivalence of 5 x 0.1 milligram (mg) capsules&#xD;
      compared to 1 x 0.5 mg capsule of dutasteride in healthy male subjects. The results of this&#xD;
      study are expected to support registration applications for androgenetic alopecia (AGA) in&#xD;
      Japan and other international markets.&#xD;

    <description>Subjects will be hospitalized to the clinical unit on the evening of Day -1. All subjects will receive 1 x 0.5mg oral dose of dutasteride (Sequence A), in the morning; Subjects will remain in the clinical unit until completion of all assessments at 24 hours post-dose on Day 2 including collection of the 24 hour post-dose PK sample. Subjects will return to the unit for the remaining PK samples at 36, 48 and 72 hours. The subject will receive or 5 x 0.1mg oral dose of dutasteride (Sequence B) in similar fashion as that of Sequence A. The two treatment sequences will be separated by a minimum washout period of 28 days to ensure that dutasteride is effectively eliminated from the subject between dosing occasions.</description>
