  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Estrogen receptor positive breast cancer is the most common type of breast cancer and&#xD;
      anti-estrogen therapy has been shown to be very effective in preventing recurrence. Side&#xD;
      effects of anti-estrogens are due to estrogen deprivation and include hot flashes, mood&#xD;
      changes and vaginal dryness/pain. Vaginal symptoms including pain, dryness, itching, bleeding&#xD;
      after intercourse and frequent urinary tract infections have been reported to cause&#xD;
      significant morbidity in postmenopausal women and higher in breast cancer survivors on&#xD;
      anti-estrogen therapy. Treatment options include vaginal lubricants, Replens etc but&#xD;
      unfortunately many women continue to have persistent symptoms. Local estrogen has been shown&#xD;
      to be effective in post menopausal women (Estring or Vagifem) for their vaginal symptoms.&#xD;
      There is a concern of using this in women with breast cancer given it may increase their&#xD;
      blood estrogen levels. Studies done so far show have shown controversial results but majority&#xD;
      of them report that blood estrogen levels do not change significantly. The major drawback of&#xD;
      the studies was the sample size and inadequate accrual. The most recent trial reported showed&#xD;
      no significant change in blood estrogen levels in women with breast cancer treated with&#xD;
      aromatase inhibitors (anti-estrogen therapy) and were on vagifem for their vaginal symptoms.&#xD;
      The authors reported results in 26 patients and reported no significant change in blood&#xD;
      estrogen level. We propose to study the change in blood estrogen level when postmenopausal&#xD;
      women with breast cancer who are currently on aromatase inhibitors are treated with Estring&#xD;
      for their vaginal symptoms.&#xD;

    <description>ESTRING® (estradiol vaginal ring) is a slightly opaque ring with a whitish core containing a drug reservoir of 2 mg estradiol. Estradiol, silicone polymers and barium sulfate are combined to form the ring. When placed in the vagina, ESTRING releases estradiol, approximately 7.5 mcg per 24 hours, in a consistent stable manner over 90 days.</description>

          -  Stage I-III estrogen receptor positive breast cancer (positive for estrogen receptor&#xD;
             (ER)) with positivity defined as immunohistochemical staining in ≥ 10% of cells) on&#xD;
             adjuvant hormonal therapy with aromatase inhibitors (anastrozole, letrozole or&#xD;

             activity. This is recognized to occur after 12 consecutive months of amenorrhea, for&#xD;
             which there is no other obvious pathological or physiological cause.)&#xD;
