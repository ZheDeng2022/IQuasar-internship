  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the microbiological and clinical outcome&#xD;
      of treatment with finafloxacin for 5 days versus finafloxacin for 10 days versus&#xD;
      ciprofloxacin for 10 days as a reference comparator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finafloxacin shows increased activity in an acidic environment which is associated with&#xD;
      indications such as uUTI and cUTI. Given the acidic pH of urine and concentration of&#xD;
      finafloxacin excreted via the urinary tract in humans it should be proven if the finafloxacin&#xD;
      treatments offer significant advantages over the currently available treatments for UTI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fluoroquinolones are frequently prescribed for complicated Urinary Tract Infections (cUTI)&#xD;
      and pyelonephritis, due to their activity against cUTI pathogens and high levels of excretion&#xD;
      in the urine following oral and i.v. administration. However, many currently prescribed&#xD;
      fluoroquinolones exhibit reduced antibacterial activity at low pH, which suggests reduced&#xD;
      activity in infected urinary tracts.&#xD;

    <description>The primary endpoint of this study is the clinical and microbiological response of patients with cUTI or pyelonephritis to treatment with finafloxacin for 5 days versus finafloxacin for 10 days versus ciprofloxacin for 10 days as a reference comparator at the Test of Cure (ToC) visit (Day 17) in the microbiological intent-to-treat population (micro-ITT population).&#xD;
Clinical response is defined as resolution of the symptoms of cUTI present at trial entry and no new symptoms developed. Microbiological response is defined as elimination or reduction of study entry pathogens to ≤ 10e3 CFU/mL on urine culture. The clinical and microbiological response will be assessed for each group on Day 17 and will be compared between the three groups to assess the efficacy in each group.</description>

&#xD;
          2. If a female and&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. subject is of childbearing potential, must have documented use of using an&#xD;
                  effective contraceptive method (such as IUD, hormonal birth control, condom and&#xD;
                  spermicidal jelly, etc.) during the study, Contraception must have been used for&#xD;
                  at least 2 months before starting the study. A documented negative urine&#xD;
                  pregnancy test must be provided and the subject must be non-lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. subject is of non-childbearing potential, must be post-menopausal (i.e. has had&#xD;
                  amenorrhea for a minimum of 12 consecutive months) or surgically sterile due to&#xD;
                  bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or hysterectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. subject is truly abstinent. This is accepted as a method of contraception, but&#xD;
                  only when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject.&#xD;
                  Periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation&#xD;
                  methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. If a male, should agree to use reliable birth control methods (contraception or other&#xD;
             barrier device) during study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Must have complicated lower urinary tract infection or acute complicated or&#xD;
             uncomplicated pyelonephritis (cPN or uPN; see section 5.3) and must have at least two&#xD;
             of the following acute signs and symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Chills or rigors or warmth associated with fever (e.g. oral temperature greater&#xD;
                  than 38.0 degrees Celsius ).&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Flank pain (pyelonephritis) or pelvic pain (cUTI).&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Nausea or vomiting.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Dysuria, urinary frequency, or urinary urgency.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Costo-vertebral angle tenderness (pyelonephritis) on physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Provide one pre-treatment adequate urine sample (the urine sample must return a&#xD;
             positive culture in order for the subject to remain eligible for the study) For males:&#xD;
             midstream clean catch, for females: in-out catheterisation or midstream clean catch.&#xD;
             The urine sample must be provided within 24 hours before the start of administration&#xD;
             of the first dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
             A positive urine culture is defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  ≥ 105 CFU/mL of one causative pathogen in the case of cUTI&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  ≥ 104 CFU/mL of one causative pathogen in case of Pyelonephritis&#xD;
&#xD;
             A negative urine culture is defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  &lt; 105 CFU/mL of causative pathogen/s and/or non-target pathogens at any number of&#xD;
                  CFUs in the case of cUTI&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  &lt; 104 CFU/mL of causative pathogen/s and/or non-target pathogens at any number of&#xD;
                  CFUs in the case of Pyelonephritis Patients may be admitted to the study pending&#xD;
                  baseline urine culture results. Treatment should NOT be delayed pending urine&#xD;
                  culture results.&#xD;
&#xD;
             NOTE: Because biofilms on indwelling catheters (e.g. Foley catheters) are more likely&#xD;
             to be present after the catheter has been in place for a period of time, samples&#xD;
             should be collected following the placement of a new catheter. If the placement of a&#xD;
             new catheter is contraindicated or is not feasible, specimens should be collected&#xD;
             using aseptic techniques with the urine obtained through a properly disinfected&#xD;
             collection port. Urine samples should never be obtained from the collection bag.&#xD;
&#xD;
             If the subject's pre-treatment culture shows the presence of a ciprofloxacin resistant&#xD;
             pathogen the Investigator has to decide according to clinical signs and symptoms&#xD;
             whether the subject can stay in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             In the event of a negative urine culture, the subject must be withdrawn from the study&#xD;
             and switched to standard care, because the inclusion criterion is not fulfilled.&#xD;
&#xD;
             A urine culture is defined as contaminated if:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  at least one causative pathogen with ≥ 105 CFU/mL is present AND at least one&#xD;
                  non-pathogen or additional causative pathogen/s at any number of CFU/mL are&#xD;
                  present in the case of cUTI&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  at least one causative pathogen with ≥ 104 CFU/mL is present AND at least one&#xD;
                  non-pathogen or additional causative pathogen/s with any number of CFU/mL in the&#xD;
                  case of pyelonephritis Subjects with contaminated urine cultures will be&#xD;
                  permitted to continue in the study, although this will impact on the subject's&#xD;
                  eligibility for analysis (see section 9.3).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Have pyuria (i.e. a dipstick analysis positive for leukocyte esterase or at least 10&#xD;
             white blood cells per cubic millimetre [1 µl]).&#xD;

        <title>Number of Participants With Clinical and Microbiological Response</title>
        <description>The primary endpoint of this study is the clinical and microbiological response of patients with cUTI or pyelonephritis to treatment with finafloxacin for 5 days versus finafloxacin for 10 days versus ciprofloxacin for 10 days as a reference comparator at the Test of Cure (ToC) visit (Day 17) in the microbiological intent-to-treat population (micro-ITT population).&#xD;
Clinical response is defined as resolution of the symptoms of cUTI present at trial entry and no new symptoms developed. Microbiological response is defined as elimination or reduction of study entry pathogens to ≤ 10e3 CFU/mL on urine culture. The clinical and microbiological response will be assessed for each group on Day 17 and will be compared between the three groups to assess the efficacy in each group.</description>
        <time_frame>Day 17</time_frame>
        <population>The micro-ITT population is composed of all randomized patients who have a baseline bacterial pathogen on culture of urine or blood that causes UTI against which the investigational drug has antibacterial activity.</population>

          <title>Number of Participants With Clinical and Microbiological Response</title>
          <description>The primary endpoint of this study is the clinical and microbiological response of patients with cUTI or pyelonephritis to treatment with finafloxacin for 5 days versus finafloxacin for 10 days versus ciprofloxacin for 10 days as a reference comparator at the Test of Cure (ToC) visit (Day 17) in the microbiological intent-to-treat population (micro-ITT population).&#xD;
Clinical response is defined as resolution of the symptoms of cUTI present at trial entry and no new symptoms developed. Microbiological response is defined as elimination or reduction of study entry pathogens to ≤ 10e3 CFU/mL on urine culture. The clinical and microbiological response will be assessed for each group on Day 17 and will be compared between the three groups to assess the efficacy in each group.</description>

The safety outcome measures assessed are the following: vital signs, physical examinations, ECGs, haematology, biochemistry, urinalysis, adverse events and serious adverse events. Adverse events and serious adverse events will be documented throughout the study for each group (including comparator group and the incidence and severity of their occurrence will be compared between all groups. The results of all other safety outcome measures will be compared with the baseline values of each group to determine if significant changes occurred during the course of the study within one group. The results at the different visits will also be compared between the groups to identify significant differences between the 3 treatment groups.</description>

Adverse events and serious adverse events will be documented throughout the study for each group (including comparator group and the incidence and severity of their occurrence will be compared between all groups. The results of all other safety outcome measures will be compared with the baseline values of each group to determine if significant changes occurred during the course of the study within one group. The results at the different visits will also be compared between the groups to identify significant differences between the 3 treatment groups.</description>
