  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent clinical studies have shown that atrial fibrillation (AF) in humans might be sustained&#xD;
      by localized sources called &quot;mother rotors&quot; which exhibit persistent, fast, and well&#xD;
      organized activity during AF and play an important role in the generation and maintenance of&#xD;
      the fibrillatory activity. In this study, investigators aim to identify the&#xD;
      electrophysiological characteristics of mother rotors during atrial fibrillation in patients&#xD;
      with paroxysmal and persistent AF and to test whether ablation of such patient-specific&#xD;
      substrates might improve the acute and long-term success of conventional catheter ablation&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;

      The present study is designed as a prospective, single-centre, randomized, single-blind,&#xD;
      controlled, 2-arm parallel group trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) a two-month screening period; ii) randomization and treatment phase; iii) a follow-up&#xD;
      phase lasting up to 24 months. Patients with paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation&#xD;
      referred to the centre to undergo catheter ablation procedure will be screened. It is&#xD;
      expected that approximately 260 patients will be screened in order to have 234 patients&#xD;
      fulfilling inclusion criteria at the end of the screening period. The sample will include 154&#xD;
      patients with paroxysmal AF and 80 patients with persistent AF. Paroxysmal and persistent AF&#xD;
      will be defined according to current ESC guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients fulfilling selection criteria, will be informed of the study and asked for&#xD;
      participation. The study requirements, including required testing, will be discussed with the&#xD;
      subject. A signed Informed Consent Form for study participation must be obtained prior to any&#xD;
      study-related procedure. Patients will be given a daily diary for recording AF-related signs&#xD;
      and symptoms and instructed to bring it back at the inclusion visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be randomised using a web-based randomization system embedded in the&#xD;
      electronic CRF (e-CRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomization schedule, stratified by AF type, using balanced blocks will be established&#xD;
      before the start of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomised to one of the two ablation procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  standard circumferential pulmonary vein isolation (CPVI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CPVI followed by rotors' identification and ablation (CPVI + Rotor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The acute endpoint for AF ablation procedure is electrical isolation of the pulmonary veins&#xD;
      and non inducibility of AF by atrial extrastimuli.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rotors are defined as fast and persistent electrical activation with intracardiac&#xD;
      electrograms of regular cycle lengths shorter than 240 ms with stable isoelectric line&#xD;
      between two adjacent activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The acute endpoints for rotors are their identification by predefined mapping characteristics&#xD;
      and their elimination by radiofrequency ablation after circumferential pulmonary vein&#xD;
      isolation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antiarrhythmic medications may be continued for the first 3 months following the first&#xD;
      ablation to avoid early recurrences. At 3 months, antiarrhythmics must be stopped to assess&#xD;
      for clinical recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Freedom from symptomatic AF, atrial tachycardia, and atrial flutter off antiarrhythmic drug&#xD;
      therapy as assessed from the end of the 3 months blanking period to 12 months following the&#xD;
      ablation procedure, and documented by implantable loop recorder monitoring or&#xD;
      trans-telephonic (TT) ECG monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AF episodes &gt; 10 minutes documented by implantable loop recorder registrations or daily&#xD;
      trans-telephonic (TT) ECG will be recorded in the e-CRF, clearly identified by date and time&#xD;
      of occurrence. Total duration of the episode will also be recorded. In addition, presence of&#xD;
      symptoms, as reported by the patient in the daily diary will be sought.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Clinical Events Committee (CEC) made up of three cardiologists and arrhythmologists who are&#xD;
      not participants in the study will review and adjudicate, symptomatic and asymptomatic AF&#xD;
      recurrences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Clinical Research Unit staff will support the Investigator and the Sponsor to maintain a&#xD;
      high level of ethical, scientific, technical and regulatory quality in all aspects of the&#xD;
      Clinical Trial. At regular intervals during the Clinical Trial, the Clinical Research Unit&#xD;
      staff will review study progress and any emergent problems. Random source data verification&#xD;
      will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected by means of an electronic e-CRF, FDA 21 CFR part 11 compliant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A detailed Statistical Analysis Plan will be issued.&#xD;
