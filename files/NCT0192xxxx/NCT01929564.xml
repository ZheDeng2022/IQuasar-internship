    <textblock>
      The participants of this study will be men &amp; women ≥50 years who are deemed to have a 10-30%&#xD;
      risk of developing CVD over the next 10 years. Their risk will be calculated using the Joint&#xD;
      British Societies 2 (JBS2) guidelines on the prevention of CVD in clinical practise&#xD;
      algorithm. This takes into account the participants age, sex, cholesterol values, blood&#xD;
      pressure,family history and their ethnicity (SE Asian or not). The participants will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to one of two groups with the aid of a computer program called &quot;minim&quot;&#xD;
      which uses their age, sex, BMI and smoking status to determine which broccoli each&#xD;
      participant will consume on the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will consume 4 x 100g of their assigned broccoli, each week for 12 weeks on&#xD;
      top of their normal diet. They will be allowed to eat the broccoli whenever they want during&#xD;
      the week, but will be asked to note down when they eat it. A steamer will be provided so&#xD;
      participants can cook their broccoli for the required 4-5 minutes. Participants will be asked&#xD;
      to keep two diet diaries during their time on the intervention, one before they start the&#xD;
      intervention and one towards the end. Blood samples and urine will also be collected, pre and&#xD;
      post intervention, for the analysis of biomarkers of CVD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is joint project based at two sites, the Institute of Food (IFR) Research in Norwich and&#xD;
      the University of Reading(UoR), in Reading. Samples from the participants at both sites will&#xD;
      be analysed at IFR, UoR and companies in the United States.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This intervention will take place at two independent sites, The Institute of Food Research's&#xD;
      Human Nutrition Unit (HNU)in Norwich and the Hugh Sinclair Human Nutrition Unit (HSU), at the&#xD;
      University of Reading. The participants recruited from Norwich and Reading will solely attend&#xD;
      the unit in their area and the paper work has been written to reflect this i.e.separate&#xD;
      participant information sheets (PIS). In addition to the tests carried out at both sites, the&#xD;
      Reading cohort will also undergo additional vascular tests, also reflected in the PIS.&#xD;
      Despite the sites being independent, 96 participants will be recruited across both sites,&#xD;
      with the possibility of uneven numbers from each site making up the final number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess whether diet can affect an individuals chances of&#xD;
      developing CVD, as it is one of the biggest killers in the UK. We are particularly interested&#xD;
      in participants who have a 10%-30% risk of developing CVD. We are able to assess a person's&#xD;
      risk with the help of the Joint British Societies 2 guidelines on the prevention of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease, cardiovascular disease risk prediction chart. These charts take a&#xD;
      number of parameters we obtain from the participant, their age, sex, total cholesterol&#xD;
      concentration, systolic blood pressure (BP), body mass index (BMI), serum high density&#xD;
      lipoprotein concentration, their smoking status and diabetes status and put them into an&#xD;
      algorithm. The result is a risk score out of 100, of a person developing CVD over the next 10&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted over two sites, Reading and Norwich, with a principal&#xD;
      investigator assigned to each site. The total number of participants recruited over both&#xD;
      sites will be 96. It may be that uneven numbers are recruited over the two sites e.g. 46 at&#xD;
      one and 50 at another however regardless of the number at each site, 48 participants will be&#xD;
      assigned to each of the two groups. One group will consume 400g of the commercially available&#xD;
      high glucosinolate Beneforté® broccoli each week for 12 weeks and the other will consume 400g&#xD;
      of a standard broccoli, Parthenon for 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As we are assessing the effect of diet on CVD risk, our participants will be screened&#xD;
      initially. Their urine will be tested (urine dipstick test), their height, weight, waist and&#xD;
      hip measurements, BMI, BP will be measured and questions linked to lifestyle choices (alcohol&#xD;
      consumption, smoking status and physical activity) will be asked. A separate section&#xD;
      pertaining to women's health will also be present on the questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be asked to give written informed consent before they can participate&#xD;
      in the intervention study. The Reading cohort will be sent a copy of the consent and medical&#xD;
      declaration forms to read through at home. The forms sent to the homes will be clearly&#xD;
      distinguishable from the real forms as they will have the watermark with &quot;SAMPLE&quot; written&#xD;
      across them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CVD risk assessment calculator This calculator will be used once the results of the screening&#xD;
      are known. A program devised by the University of Manchester will be used to calculate the&#xD;
      risk our participants have of developing CVD over the next 10 years. This program is based on&#xD;
      the Joint British Societies 2 guidelines on the prevention of CVD risk prediction charts. For&#xD;
      the purposes of this study we would like our participants to fall into the 10%-30% risk&#xD;
      category as most literature suggests people in this range may benefit from dietary change,&#xD;
      without the need for medication, in the most part. The CVD risk scores will be sent to the&#xD;
      participants GP and we will continue to advise our participants to discuss the results with&#xD;
      their GPs if they score &gt;10%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genotyping There is evidence to suggest that a person's genetic make-up may affect the way&#xD;
      isothiocyanates (ITCs), one of the active components of broccoli, work. Of the 30,000 genes&#xD;
      found in humans a group of genes associated with the protein glutathione S-transferase M1&#xD;
      (GSTM1) has been shown to affect ITCs after consumption and has been implicated in CVD. There&#xD;
      is evidence to suggest that individuals with a deletion in GSTM1 breakdown the glucosinolate,&#xD;
      from which the ITC sulforaphane is derived, differently to individuals that have the gene. We&#xD;
      also know that glutathione S-transferase theta-1 (GSTT1) may also be involved in reducing the&#xD;
      likelihood of developing CVD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Along with the GST gene family and their association with cruciferous vegetables, there are a&#xD;
      number of other genes that have been implicated in CVD itself. These include genes associated&#xD;
      with lipid metabolism, thrombosis, leukocyte adhesion and nitric oxide production and thus&#xD;
      blood vessel dilation. This is by no means an exhaustive list and will therefore remain open&#xD;
      to other viable candidates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vascular measurements As we age, our arteries stiffen which causes an increase in the demands&#xD;
      of the heart and an increase in blood pressure. This increase in BP can dramatically increase&#xD;
      the risk of heart attack, stroke and heart failure. Arterial stiffness has also been&#xD;
      associated with many of the common risk factors associated with CVD such as age, high blood&#xD;
      pressure, smoking, cholesterol levels and obesity, but importantly, arterial stiffness has&#xD;
      been shown to be an independent predictor of CVD in a large section of society.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many ways in which arterial stiffness can be assessed. We will be looking at blood&#xD;
      pressure, which will be very familiar to most participants in our age range (over 50yrs of&#xD;
      age). The only difference being that the participant will wear a cuff for an hour and&#xD;
      readings will be collected every ten minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another method will be Pulse Wave Analysis (PWA), where a probe will be held against the neck&#xD;
      and the upper thigh to take the measurements for up to a minute at a time. As participants&#xD;
      may not be wholly familiar with this technique, it is hoped that a short video clip could be&#xD;
      shown on a laptop or diagrams/photographs of the technique will be discussed with the&#xD;
      participant at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Restricted conditions prior to study day Before the study day the participants will be asked&#xD;
      to abstain from a number of activities. This will be clearly stated in the PIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. No alcohol or caffeine for 24 hours before the study day. Participants who consume a lot&#xD;
           of caffeine will be advised that they may suffer from headaches. They will be asked to&#xD;
           tell the study scientist if they needed to take any medication as a consequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Low fat meal to be consumed the night before the study day. Participants will be asked&#xD;
           to eat a low fat meal from a selected list that we give them. We will ask that the meal&#xD;
           is consumed before 10pm, as the participants will then have to fast for their study day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Fasting for at least 8 hours. Participants will need to fast for at least 8 hours. This&#xD;
           means that they won't be able to eat or drink anything, apart from water during this&#xD;
           time. They can drink as much water as they feel they need.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. No heavy exercise the morning of their study day. Participants will be asked not to&#xD;
           engage in any vigorous exercise the morning of their study day. This will be defined as&#xD;
           any activity that causes an increase in heart rate, panting and/or sweating. A&#xD;
           participant who normally cycles will be asked not to on the morning of their study day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. No smoking an hour before their study day measurements. All participants that smoke will&#xD;
           be asked to abstain from smoking at least an hour before their study day. We would also&#xD;
           ask that they avoid all passive smoking.&#xD;
