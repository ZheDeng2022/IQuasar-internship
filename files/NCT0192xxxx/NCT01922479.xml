  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) is a major global public health issue which also affects Asia. Data from&#xD;
      the National Registry of Disease in Singapore shows a 9.4% rise in HF admissions in public&#xD;
      hospitals from 2008 to 2009 (4140 to 4530). Anaemia (low blood Haemoglobin level) is a common&#xD;
      problem occurring in HF, ranging from 14% to 56% in outpatient registries and clinical&#xD;
      trials. Anaemia exacerbates the basic symptoms of HF of dyspnea and exercise intolerance,&#xD;
      thereby reducing quality of life (QoL). However, recent approaches aimed at improving and&#xD;
      normalizing Haemoglobin have been unsuccessful.Novel approaches are required to address this&#xD;
      problem. Iron deficiency (ID) is a well-understood cause of anaemia. ID without overt anaemia&#xD;
      may be present in HF patients. A recent study by Jankowska et al published in 2010 of 546 HF&#xD;
      patients showed a 37% prevalence of ID, regardless of Haemoglobin level. This was associated&#xD;
      with worse outcomes including impaired exercise capacity. The presence of ID indicates a&#xD;
      higher likelihood of deteriorating and dying early. A landmark study published in the New&#xD;
      England Journal of Medicine (The Ferinject Assessment in Patients with Iron Deficiency and&#xD;
      Chronic Heart Failure (FAIR-HF) study) showed that HF patients who were treated with IV iron&#xD;
      in the form of Ferric Carboxymaltose (FCM) had better outcomes, including improved exercise&#xD;
      capacity, overall function, and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a lack of contemporary data on ID in HF patients in Asia, including data on&#xD;
      treatment with this novel IV iron FCM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis We hypothesise that treating ID in HF patients in Asia using FCM will improve&#xD;
      outcomes including exercise capacity, quality of life, overall functional status, and the&#xD;
      need to be hospitalised for complications arising from HF.&#xD;

      Heart failure (HF) is a major global public health issue which also affects Asia. Singapore&#xD;
      National Registry of Disease data shows a 9.4% rise in public hospital HF admissions from&#xD;
      2008 to 2009 (4140 to 4530). Anaemia (low blood Haemoglobin level) is a common co-morbidity&#xD;
      in HF, ranging from 14% to 56% in outpatient registries and clinical trials. Anaemia&#xD;
      exacerbates the basic symptoms of HF of dyspnea and exercise intolerance, thereby reducing&#xD;
      quality of life (QoL). However, recent approaches aimed at improving and normalizing&#xD;
      Haemoglobin have been unsuccessful (STAMINA-HeFT, RED-HF).Novel approaches are required to&#xD;
      address this problem. Iron deficiency (ID) is a well-understood cause of anaemia. ID without&#xD;
      overt anaemia may be present in HF patients. The study by Jankowska (2010) of 546 systolic HF&#xD;
      patients had a 37% prevalence of ID, regardless of Haemoglobin level. This was associated&#xD;
      with reduced peak oxygen consumption, high ventilatory response, impaired exercise capacity,&#xD;
      and depressive symptoms in HF patients. ID was a strong independent predictor of death, heart&#xD;
      transplantation, and poor clinical outcome in chronic HF.The Ferinject Assessment in Patients&#xD;
      with Iron Deficiency and Chronic Heart Failure (FAIR-HF) study showed significant improvement&#xD;
      in 6MWT, NYHA class, and overall QoL score in HF patients treated with IV iron in the form of&#xD;
      Ferric Carboxymaltose (FCM).Unpublished preliminary data from the ongoing Nation-wide&#xD;
      Singapore study on Heart Failure (SHOP) indicates that the observed point prevalence of ID is&#xD;
      approximately 60% with a significant and direct correlation with exercise performance.To&#xD;
      date, no studies exist of FCM in an Asian HF population. We hypothesise that IV Iron&#xD;
      repletion therapy using FCM in Asian patients with HF and ID will improve outcomes including&#xD;
      exercise capacity (measured by 6MWT), quality of life (measured by the Kansas City&#xD;
      Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ amp; VAS), NYHA functional class, and rate of HF&#xD;
      hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim To determine the effect of IV iron repletion therapy compared to placebo on&#xD;
      exercise capacity change as assessed by the 6MWT at the 4th and 12th week after&#xD;
      administration of IV FCM in subjects with recent acutely decompensated heart failure and iron&#xD;
      deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aims To assess the effect of IV FCM compared with placebo on change in QoL&#xD;
      assessments (KCCQ amp; VAS).To assess the effect of IV FCM compared with placebo on change in&#xD;
      NYHA Functional Class.To assess the effect of IV FCM compared with placebo on the rate of HF&#xD;
      Hospitalization.To assess the safety and tolerability of IV FCM compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis We hypothesise that IV Iron repletion therapy using FCM in patients with HF and ID&#xD;
      will improve outcomes including exercise capacity (measured by 6MWT), quality of life&#xD;
      (measured by KCCQ amp; VAS), NYHA functional class, and rate of HF hospitalization.&#xD;
