      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of inotuzumab ozogamicin when given&#xD;
      together with combination chemotherapy in treating patients with relapsed or refractory acute&#xD;
      leukemia. Immunotoxins, such as inotuzumab ozogamicin, can find cancer cells that express&#xD;
      cluster of differentiation (CD)22 and kill them without harming normal cells. Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, vincristine sulfate, and prednisone, work in&#xD;
      different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping&#xD;
      them from dividing. Giving inotuzumab ozogamicin together with combination chemotherapy may&#xD;
      kill more cancer cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the safety of inotuzumab ozogamicin in combination with cyclophosphamide,&#xD;
      vincristine (vincristine sulfate) and prednisone (CVP) and to determine the maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose (MTD) of inotuzumab ozogamicin in this regimen for patients with relapsed or refractory&#xD;
      CD22+ acute leukemia (B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia [B-ALL], mixed phenotype, and&#xD;
      Burkitt's).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the preliminary activity (response rate: complete remission [CR] + complete&#xD;
      remission with incomplete count recovery [CRi]) of this combination in the expansion cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate the frequency and severity of toxicities of this combination in this patient&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of inotuzumab ozogamicin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) on day 1, vincristine sulfate IV on day&#xD;
      1, prednisone orally (PO) on days 1-5, and inotuzumab ozogamicin IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8,&#xD;
      and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months for 1 year,&#xD;
      every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 1 year.&#xD;
