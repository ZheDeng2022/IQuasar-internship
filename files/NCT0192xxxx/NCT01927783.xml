      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Past studies suggest that the best way to improve heart health in the Black community is&#xD;
      through community-based programs. Researchers will partner with DC community leaders. They&#xD;
      will collect information about the health and health needs of people in mostly Black churches&#xD;
      in DC. They will study things that affect heart health, like diabetes, blood pressure,&#xD;
      cholesterol, and weight. They will also study how technology can keep track of activities and&#xD;
      health. The information will show the health needs of this church-based community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To create an intervention for future programs to improve heart health in African-American&#xD;
      churches in Washington, DC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Adults ages 19 to 85 who attend one of the study churches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will visit their church for a 4-hour health exam. They will have their&#xD;
           blood pressure and body measurements taken. They will have a drop of blood taken from&#xD;
           their finger with a small needle. This blood will be tested for blood sugar and&#xD;
           cholesterol. Participants will be given the results of these tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will answer questions about their health.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will be given an activity monitor to wear for 1 month. The activity&#xD;
           monitor is worn around the wrist. Some participants will also receive an activity&#xD;
           monitor that is worn around the waist. Participants will be given instructions on how to&#xD;
           wear the activity monitors and follow the results on a website.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the end of 1 month, participants will return one device (they can keep the other).&#xD;
           They may receive a gift card for completing the study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Obesity leads to an increased risk of cardiovascular risk factors and death from&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease. Therefore, interventions that slow or reverse the obesity epidemic&#xD;
      are essential. Community-based interventions can reach those most at risk for obesity and&#xD;
      obesity-related cardiovascular risk factors. Interventions based on community-based&#xD;
      participatory research (CBPR) principles develop in collaboration with community partners,&#xD;
      allowing an intervention's components to be tailored to the unique needs of the community&#xD;
      members. To remain consistent with CBPR principles, a community assessment is necessary to&#xD;
      understand the needs of the target population. Therefore, we propose a cardiovascular health&#xD;
      screening and needs assessment of a sample population from predominantly African-American&#xD;
      churches in Wards 5, 7, and 8. These are wards in Washington D.C. where obesity prevalence is&#xD;
      highest and resources for physical activity and healthy nutrition are most limited. The&#xD;
      screening will involve measuring cardiovascular health factors such as body mass index (BMI),&#xD;
      physical activity, dietary intake, total cholesterol, blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose,&#xD;
      and cigarette smoking. Based on American Heart Association-established goals, cardiovascular&#xD;
      health factors can be defined as ideal, intermediate, or poor, depending on control of risk&#xD;
      factors and lifestyle behaviors. In this protocol, we will determine the prevalence of ideal,&#xD;
      intermediate, and poor cardiovascular health factors within the church-based population. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that the percentage of the church-based population that meets ideal criteria for&#xD;
      each of the cardiovascular health factors will be lower than the percentage meeting&#xD;
      intermediate and poor criteria for the cardiovascular health factors. In addition, we will&#xD;
      evaluate the use of handheld technology for objectively measuring physical activity and the&#xD;
      use of web-based technology for monitoring cardiovascular health factors within the&#xD;
      population. We will also evaluate social determinants of health, particularly psychosocial&#xD;
      and environmental factors that might hinder weight loss. Finally, we will establish a&#xD;
      community advisory board to consult on the planning and implementation of the assessment, and&#xD;
      the interpretation and dissemination of study findings. The results of this community-based,&#xD;
      cardiovascular health and needs assessment will inform the design and implementation of a&#xD;
      future community-based behavioral weight loss intervention.&#xD;
