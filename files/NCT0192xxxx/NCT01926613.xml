      The purpose of this study is help people with serious mental illness and receiving vocational&#xD;
      rehabilitation get and keep the job they want by improving their thinking skills, such as&#xD;
      attention and memory, using computer exercises and other strategies. One half of the&#xD;
      participants in the study will receive vocational rehabilitation and the exercises to improve&#xD;
      thinking skills, and the other half will receive just vocational rehabilitation. All&#xD;
      participants will receive an assessment of symptoms and thinking skills at the beginning of&#xD;
      the study and 6, 12, and 24 months later. Work activity during the 24 months in the study&#xD;
      will be collected. It is expected that those participants who receive the practice of their&#xD;
      thinking skills will be more likely to get and keep the job they want compared with people&#xD;
      who do not receive this treatment.&#xD;

      This randomized controlled trial is evaluating the effectiveness of a pilot-tested,&#xD;
      manualized cognitive remediation intervention entitled the &quot;Thinking Skills for Work Program&quot;&#xD;
      by comparing it to enhanced supported employment services in clients with severe mental&#xD;
      illness (SMI) who are participants in high fidelity supported employment programs at the&#xD;
      Greater Mental health Center of Manchester and Thresholds, Inc., Chicago, Il, but who have&#xD;
      had difficulty getting or keeping jobs. Participants are randomized to either the Thinking&#xD;
      Skills for Work (cognitive remediation +supported employment; CT+SE) or enhanced supported&#xD;
      employment (E-SE), with cognitive, symptom, and quality of life assessments performed at&#xD;
      baseline, 3 months (following the completion of the computerized cognitive training component&#xD;
      of the Thinking Skills for Work program), 12 months, and 24 months, and employment data&#xD;
      gathered over the full 2-year period. For the E-SE condition, supported employment services&#xD;
      are enhanced by training provided to the employment specialists regarding to recognize&#xD;
      cognitive problems related to work performance, and how employment specialists can teach&#xD;
      clients coping strategies for managing these problems. Primary analyses will focus on testing&#xD;
      the hypotheses that the Thinking Skills for Work Program (CT+SE) leads to better cognitive&#xD;
      functioning and better competitive work outcomes over the 2-year follow-up period compared to&#xD;
      the E-SE program.&#xD;

    <description>The Thinking Skills for Work Program includes 5 components delivered by a Cognitive Specialist who works collaboratively with the consumer's Employment Specialist: a) assessing the consumer's strengths and weaknesses in cognitive functioning, and analysis of the contribution of cognitive impairments and other factors to job losses and difficulties obtaining a job; b) teaching coping strategies for dealing with cognitive challenges associated with job search or maintaining a job; c) computer cognitive training involving cognitive exercises with a commercially available software program, which is designed to improve the broad range of cognitive skills through a combination of practice and strategy coaching by the Cognitive Specialist; d) job search planning; and e) job support consultation.</description>
