      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability, and the highest dose of&#xD;
      GC4419 that can be given to patients with squamous cell cancer of the head and neck who are&#xD;
      receiving standard radiation therapy and chemotherapy. This study will also evaluate GC4419&#xD;
      for the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Effect on the incidence and severity of radiation induced oral mucositis;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Effect on the response rate of squamous cell cancer of the head and neck who are&#xD;
           receiving radiation therapy and chemotherapy;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total concentrations of GC4419 that can be achieved in the blood;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Changes in proteins and genetics associated with oral mucositis;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Impact on delayed toxicities of radiation (dry mouth and reduced ability to fully open&#xD;
           the mouth);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Observe changes in genetic and molecular markers of oral mucositis;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Observe the usage of extra health resources (e.g., unplanned ER visits, feeding tube&#xD;
           use, etc.) of study patients;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the overall quality of life in study patients with oral mucositis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, single-agent, open-label clinical trial to be conducted in serial&#xD;
      cohorts of patients with squamous cell cancer of the head and neck receiving escalating doses&#xD;
      of GC4419 in combination with standard chemoradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will follow a standard 3+3 cohort design typical for phase I clinical trials, in&#xD;
      which 3 patients are initially entered at a given dose level and observed for dose-limiting&#xD;
      toxicity (DLT). For the purposes of managing dose escalation, the DLT observation window will&#xD;
      be defined as the first dose of GC4419 through 24 hours following the last dose of GC4419 for&#xD;
      an individual patient. If zero of three patients in a dose cohort experience a DLT during the&#xD;
      DLT observation window, enrollment to the next higher dose level will begin. If 1 of 3&#xD;
      patients experiences a DLT within the DLT observation window, 3 additional patients will be&#xD;
      added to the dose level. If no DLTs are observed in the 3 additional patients, dose&#xD;
      escalations will resume with enrollment to the next higher dose level. If ≥2 patients in a&#xD;
      cohort experience a DLT within the DLT observation window, that dose will be considered to&#xD;
      have exceeded the MTD. The MTD is defined as the highest dose where ≤ 1 of 6 patients&#xD;
      experience a DLT during the DLT observation period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Decisions to expand a dose cohort or proceed to dose escalation will be made after review of&#xD;
      the safety data at a dose level by the Sponsor in collaboration with investigators and&#xD;
      appropriately qualified consultants, as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned dose levels will be 15, 30, 50, 75, 112, 150, 175, 210, and 250 mg/day, with&#xD;
      subsequent dose increments of 50 mg/day, as data warrant or until an MTD is determined. These&#xD;
      dose levels represent maximum dose escalation increments. At any time, if ongoing review of&#xD;
      safety and other data warrant, intermediate dose levels may be studied (with 3-6 patients&#xD;
      enrolled per dose level). These intermediate dose levels may be selected below the next&#xD;
      planned dose level or between two dose levels previously studied. If an MTD has not been&#xD;
      determined after the 250 mg dose level, further dose escalation may be undertaken at&#xD;
      increments of 50 mg/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial dose escalation will proceed on a treatment schedule wherein GC4419 is administered&#xD;
      prior to IMRT on each of the first 14 scheduled days of IMRT. Separate dose cohorts will also&#xD;
      be studied wherein GC4419 is administered on each of the first 20, 25, 30, or all 35 days of&#xD;
      IMRT (four, five, six, or seven weeks of Active Treatment). Daily dosing of GC4419 by this&#xD;
      schedule will begin at a dose that has been shown not to exceed the MTD by the original,&#xD;
      14-dose schedule. Further dose levels may be selected following the same planned dose level&#xD;
      guidelines (including possible intermediate dose levels) and rules for determining an MTD as&#xD;
      for the 14-dose schedule. At a given daily dose level, extension of the dosing period may be&#xD;
      undertaken in increments of one week (5 doses, M-F) per cohort, in successive cohorts. For&#xD;
      example, dosing for 20 doses (4 weeks) may proceed at a given dose level only if the MTD has&#xD;
      not been exceeded for the same daily dose given for 14 doses; or, dosing for 25 doses (5&#xD;
      weeks) may proceed at a given daily dose level only if the MTD has not been exceeded for the&#xD;
      same daily dose given for 20 doses (4 weeks); etc. Note again that, for any cohort and&#xD;
      treatment duration, the DLT observation period will extend to 24 hours after the last GC4419&#xD;
      dose for an individual patient. Note also that an extension of dosing duration and an&#xD;
      escalation of the daily dose in the same step is not permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, a separate dosing cohort may be concurrently enrolled to receive 30 mg/day, M-F,&#xD;
      for 35 doses (7 weeks), based on the calculation that the total dose administered to a given&#xD;
      patient (1050 mg) will not exceed the total dose received by 3 patients at 75 mg/d x 14 doses&#xD;
      (1050 mg), which was previously determined to be safe (i.e., without any patients having&#xD;
      experienced a DLT). If this dose and schedule does not exceed the MTD as defined in this&#xD;
      protocol, enrollment of additional 7-week dosing cohorts may be undertaken by applying the&#xD;
      same total dose approach to future dose levels administered for &lt;7 weeks without exceeding&#xD;
      the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the 14-day schedule, missed doses of GC4419 may be made up prior to study day 28. On&#xD;
      schedules employing administration of GC4419 for 20 or more doses, M-F, no GC4419 doses will&#xD;
      be made up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On any schedule, additional patients may be studied at dose levels not exceeding the MTD to&#xD;
      characterize the safety, pharmacokinetics, and potential efficacy of GC4419 at those dose&#xD;
      levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least one recommended Phase 2 dose, by at least one schedule, will be identified for&#xD;
      GC4419. More than one dose may be identified for further assessment of exposure/response&#xD;
      relationships. Dose(s) recommended for further study will be at or below the MTD, with&#xD;
      exposure and preliminary efficacy data suggesting that they may warrant further investigation&#xD;
      for safety and efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis. Supportive care measures including&#xD;
      those directed at controlling symptoms resulting from the patient's malignancy are allowed at&#xD;
      the discretion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic samples will be obtained from all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the safety and tolerability of GC4419 when administered with standard&#xD;
           chemoradiation, by observation of the frequency and severity of adverse events with the&#xD;
           study regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine a Maximum Tolerated Dose/Recommended Phase 2 dose and schedule of GC4419&#xD;
           for further study when administered in combination with standard chemoradiation to&#xD;
           patients with squamous cell cancers of the mouth and oropharynx&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;

           in patients receiving GC4419 when administered in combination with standard&#xD;
           chemoradiation&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To preliminarily assess the tumor response to standard chemoradiation when administered&#xD;
           in conjunction with GC4419&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the pharmacodynamic effects of GC4419&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To correlate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of GC4419 with the incidence,&#xD;
           severity and time to first onset of oral mucositis&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the potential synergistic effect of GC4419 with chemoradiation on tumor&#xD;
           response using pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To evaluate the effect of GC4419 on specific late toxicities (xerostomia and trismus) of&#xD;
           standard chemoradiation&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To collect information about health resource utilization&#xD;
&#xD;

    <description>GC4419 is a novel, highly stable manganese-containing macrocyclic ligand complex with a molecular weight of 483, whose activity mimics that of naturally occurring superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzymes. It is therefore a prototype of a new class of drugs termed selective SOD mimetics. GC4419 selectively removes superoxide anions without reacting with other reactive oxygen species, including nitric oxide, hydrogen peroxide, and peroxynitrite.</description>
