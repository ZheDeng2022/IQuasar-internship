  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Out of 300 million persons in the United States, about one-half of one percent, or 1.5&#xD;
      million, have a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia begins in young adulthood, and&#xD;
      often is chronic and disabling for the remainder of the life course], which is shorter than&#xD;
      for the general population by as much as 25 years. The costs of schizophrenia in the United&#xD;
      States are estimated to be between $30 and $60 billion dollars annually. Treatment for&#xD;
      schizophrenia is only marginally successful: in the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of&#xD;
      Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE), for example, the medication prescribed at the beginning&#xD;
      of the trial was stopped or changed in nearly 75% by the completion of the trial 18 months&#xD;
      later. The medications have limited effect on negative symptoms or cognitive impairments of&#xD;
      schizophrenia, and many have severe and permanent side effects. The basic hypothesis&#xD;
      underlying treatment for schizophrenia has not changed for more than half a century. New&#xD;
      treatments are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Much accumulating evidence suggests that sensitivity to gluten may be related to symptoms or&#xD;
      etiology in schizophrenia and that gluten free diets may lead to significant symptom&#xD;
      resolution, but only in patients who are known to have antibodies to gluten.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gluten sensitivity may be more common than thought and stems from a different etiology and&#xD;
      symptom presentation than Celiac Disease. The investigators analysis of the CATIE sample show&#xD;
      that about 23% of persons with schizophrenia (compared to 3% of healthy controls) have Gluten&#xD;
      Sensitivity (about 300,000 persons in the United States) through the identification of&#xD;
      gliadin positive antibodies in their blood. The investigators hypothesize that people with&#xD;
      this biomarker could have robust symptom improvements with the removal of the antigen from&#xD;
      the diet (gluten). If only half of people with schizophrenia and these antibodies were to&#xD;
      substantially benefit from removal of gluten from the diet, as in the case studies and with&#xD;
      certain subjects in the clinical trials, this would provide a new transformative treatment&#xD;
      option for an identifiable subpopulation of people with schizophrenia and would be of&#xD;
      enormous benefit to patients, families and society. Another benefit to the public's health&#xD;
      from this study will be enhanced knowledge of the etiology of schizophrenia, including&#xD;
      possible linkages between neuropsychiatric disease and immune system activation, and&#xD;
      identification of novel, immune-linked treatment targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this research could lead to screening for Anti-Gliadin Antibodies early in&#xD;
      life or at the first episode of schizophrenia, as recommended by some already. Screening&#xD;
      involves financial and emotional costs, and better evidence is needed before this&#xD;
      recommendation can be justified. Moreover, a new treatment paradigm of removing gluten from&#xD;
      the diet by means of gluten blocking medications (already in early study) could advance&#xD;
      treatment significantly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will test the efficacy, in a pilot fashion, of 20 participants in a double blind&#xD;
      five week randomized placebo controlled gluten free diet vs identical diet with gluten in&#xD;
      gliadin-positive individuals with schizophrenia. Approximately equal numbers will receive the&#xD;
      addition of gluten, or non-gluten starch, in identical form (given as flour in food). The&#xD;
      investigators plan to develop mechanisms and procedures to locate, screen, and recruit&#xD;
      subjects into the inpatient intervention study, retain them during the inpatient phase. Once&#xD;
      admitted baseline assessments may take approximately a few days but will be mostly completed&#xD;
      in the first week prior to the 5 week randomization, thus patients may stay longer than 5&#xD;
      weeks. At the end of the double blind trial the investigators will prepare for discharge and&#xD;
      then test the feasibility of successfully maintaining gluten free diets after the&#xD;
      intervention phase is complete, for at least two months.&#xD;
