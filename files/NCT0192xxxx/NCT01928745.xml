      To diagnose acid base disturbances using blood gas analysis, multiple approaches are&#xD;
      currently in use. These include the classic Henderson-Hasselbach bicarbonate approach and the&#xD;
      physiochemical approach by Stewart1. All have shown to be mathematically compatible2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosing the metabolic component of acid base disturbances relies on the assessment of the&#xD;
      so called ion gaps: the anion gap for the classic acid-base approach and the strong ion&#xD;
      difference (SID) for the Stewart approach. This gap may unveil unidentified anions to provide&#xD;
      a more accurate diagnosis. In particular they allow differentiating between relative&#xD;
      hyperchloremia and other strong ions such as lactate, ketones, salicylates, citrate and&#xD;
      ethylene glycol3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The accuracy of both gaps relies on the estimation of the weak acid dissociation: A-. This A-&#xD;
      is dependent on the total concentration of weak acids (Atot) of which albumin is the most&#xD;
      important and the effective dissociation constant for these (Ka), which determines the&#xD;
      dissociated fraction of the Atot. This dissociation fraction needs to be accounted for in the&#xD;
      ion gaps. This is reflected in the recommendation to correct the anion gap for albumin and&#xD;
      incorporated in the SID which includes a factor for albumin by design3,4. However, the&#xD;
      correction factor for albumin is currently based on data from animals and healthy&#xD;
      volunteers4-9. In the critically ill albumin and protein content are very different compared&#xD;
      to healthy volunteers, most notably in sepsis. Further, it is unknown if subunit composition&#xD;
      of albumin is different in these patients. In addition, different protein species may be&#xD;
      either up or downregulated in the critically ill1,8,9.Therefore from a pathophysiological&#xD;
      point of view Atot and Ka and thus A- may differ in the critically ill. However it has not&#xD;
      been previously investigated if and to what extent these matters affect Atot and Ka and&#xD;
      therefore A- in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, previous studies looking into this values showed a higher than expected value of&#xD;
      unmeasured anions from the gap calculations. Despite rigorous experimental effort including&#xD;
      high performance liquid chromatography, the origin of these unmeasured anions have not yet&#xD;
      been elucidated17-20. However if the assumptions made in the Stewarts approach would not be&#xD;
      valid, the existence of these unknown anions may have to be questioned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus it is of great interest to experimentally determine the exact contribution of the weak&#xD;
      acids and their dissociation in sepsis. This could have major implications for these patients&#xD;
      because different assumptions will ultimately lead to alterations in their calculated anion&#xD;
      gap or SID. This may reduce unnecessary diagnostic test, alter final diagnosis and hence&#xD;
      alter therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators aim to experimentally determine the Atot and Ka and thus&#xD;
      their dissociated fraction A- in critically ill septic patients admitted to the intensive&#xD;
      care unit by using in vitro CO2 tonometry, plasma dialysis and Marquardt regression analysis.&#xD;
      In addition, as a control the investigators will do the same for patients admitted to the&#xD;
      intensive care after routine cardiac surgery. Furthermore Atot and Ka values for both groups&#xD;
      will be compared to values obtained from human volunteers in a previous study4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve this, the investigators will plot CO2 versus pH titration curves from plasma&#xD;
      samples of these patients. The investigators will then use Marquardt nonlinear regression&#xD;
      analysis to quantify Atot and Ka and the SID by simultaneously solving for these&#xD;
      parameters21. To make the quantification for Atot and Ka more robust, the investigators will&#xD;
      also perform the same experiments after dialyzing the obtained plasma samples against a&#xD;
      crystalloid solution of known composition in order to eliminate errors related to estimation&#xD;
      of the SID. Finally, Atot and Ka values for both groups will be compared to values obtained&#xD;
      from human volunteers in a previous study4. For application in the bicarbonate and base&#xD;
      excess centred frameworks, Atot and Ka values will be related to albumin and protein content&#xD;
      to update the correction factor for the anion gap in critically ill.&#xD;
