      Objective: Statins have been shown to have beneficial pleiotropic effects besides being lipid&#xD;
      lowering. The investigators hypothesized that early and intensive statin treatment was&#xD;
      associated with improved left ventricular (LV) function and with a stabilization of the&#xD;
      coronary atherosclerotic plaques in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) Method:&#xD;
      In a prospective randomized blinded endpoint trial patients with ST segment elevation or non&#xD;
      ST segment elevation AMI were randomized to either intensive statin-therapy (loading dose&#xD;
      rosuvastatin 80 mg immediately after randomization followed by 40 mg daily) or usual statin&#xD;
      therapy (simvastatin 40 mg daily). Patients were followed 12 month and the investigators&#xD;
      performed echocardiography at randomization, after 30 days and after 12 month. The&#xD;
      investigators used 2D Speckle Tracking for the assessment of LV-function. Coronary plaque&#xD;
      assessment was done with Cardiac-CT (MSCT) at baseline and after 12 month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome for this study was assessment of LV function with global and regional&#xD;
      myocardial strain. Secondary outcomes can be divided in 4 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Additional echocardiographic measurements such as Ejection Fraction, SÂ´, LV-volume,&#xD;
           atrial volume, VA-coupling, diastolic function, post systolic strain and strain rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Biochemical assessment of inflammation and endothelial function: Hs-CRP, ICAM, VCAM,&#xD;
           E-selection and Nitrate/Nitrite ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Coronary plaque assessment by MSCT: Plaque volume and plaque stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Long term follow-up: Mortality and cardiovascular events&#xD;

      Introduction Coronary heart disease (CHD) remains the leading cause of mortality in the&#xD;
      western world. In Europe, CHD accounts for one fifth of all deaths annually. Acute myocardial&#xD;
      infarction (AMI) is caused primarily by plaque rupture and it has been demonstrated that the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of AMI involves interplay of the endothelium, the inflammatory cells and the&#xD;
      thrombogenicity of the blood. Following an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), profound&#xD;
      structural changes can be encountered, resulting in left ventricular (LV) remodeling and&#xD;
      development of depressed cardiac function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart failure (HF) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide with an&#xD;
      estimated prevalence of 1% to 2% in the western world and AMI remains the predominant cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statins were first developed to improve the lipid profile and reduce the development of CVD.&#xD;
      Several large randomized controlled trials have shown that statin therapy is beneficial in&#xD;
      both primary and secondary prevention of atherothrombosis. Results from two large, acute&#xD;
      coronary syndrome trials suggested further clinical benefit of statins in addition to their&#xD;
      lipid lowering effect. This stemmed from the observation of a cardiovascular event-rate&#xD;
      reduction in patients with AMI only weeks after initiation of statin treatment. Several&#xD;
      experimental studies have demonstrated that statins, apart from their LDL lowering effect,&#xD;
      exert beneficial pleiotropic effects on inflammation, endothelial function, thrombosis,&#xD;
      plaque stability and ischaemic-reperfusion injury.Other experimental studies in animals have&#xD;
      reported beneficial effects of statins on LV function after AMI. In clinical settings statins&#xD;
      have been shown to prevent periprocedural myocardial damage in patients treated with&#xD;
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and the ARMYDA-ACS trial demonstrated a protective&#xD;
      effect of statin loading on the myocardium before PCI in patients with ACS. Only a few&#xD;
      clinical studies have directly investigated the acute effect of statins on LV function in&#xD;
      patients with AMI and the results are inconclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All previous studies have concentrated on patients with STEMI and disregarded those with&#xD;
      NSTEMI; moreover, no studies have investigated the effect of an early statin loading dose in&#xD;
      patients with AMI. The investigators hypothesized that early and intensive statin treatment&#xD;
      was associated with improved left ventricular (LV) function and with a stabilization of the&#xD;
      coronary atherosclerotic plaques in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) Thus, the&#xD;
      primary aim of the Intensify trial was to examine the effect of early intensive statin&#xD;
      treatment on LV function with strain echocardiography in patients with AMI after 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Study population This study was a prospective randomized controlled (RCT) trial with&#xD;
      a blinded endpoint design. The trial was approved by the Regional Scientific Ethics Committee&#xD;
      for Southern Denmark and the Danish Data Protection Agency. Patients with AMI defined by&#xD;
      current guidelines were consecutively collected from a single coronary care unit from April&#xD;
      2010-august 2012. Inclusion criteria were all patients with NSTEMI and STEMI, and the&#xD;
      exclusion criteria were prior intensive statin treatment, contraindication to intensive&#xD;
      statin therapy and a time limit above 24 hours from hospital admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were randomized to either intensive statin treatment with rosuvastatin 40 mg or&#xD;
      usual care with simvastatin 40 mg. The intensive care group was given a loading dose of&#xD;
      rosuvastatin 80 mg as soon as possible followed by 40 mg daily. The usual care group was&#xD;
      treated with simvastatin 40 mg daily. Apart from the different statin treatment, all patients&#xD;
      were treated the same according to current national guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were followed for 12 month and examined immediately after randomization, after 1&#xD;
      month and after 12 month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronary angiography and Culprit vessel Culprit vessel and infarct location was identified&#xD;
      from the coronary angiography. In patients with single vessel disease (lumen stenosis &lt; 50%)&#xD;
      the diseased vessel was identified as culprit. In patients with multi-vessel disease, the&#xD;
      culprit vessel was identified by a combination of angiographic and electrocardiographic&#xD;
      criteria. In patients with normal CAG we used electrocardiographic and multi-slice computer&#xD;
      tomography to identify the culprit lesion. If the culprit lesion could not be found, the&#xD;
      patient was excluded from the study. The investigators used the AHA scientific statement of&#xD;
      myocardial segmentation and nomenclature for tomographic imaging from 2002 to define the&#xD;
      coronary arteries supply area of the myocardium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiography Echocardiography was performed at randomization and after 30 days using the&#xD;
      GE Vivid 7 ultrasound system (GE Medical System Inc., Horten, Norway) with a standard 3.5 MHz&#xD;
      ultrasound probe. A standardized protocol was followed at each examination and all&#xD;
      examinations were performed by one operator. Consecutive heartbeats were recorded at a sweep&#xD;
      speed of 25 mm/s and digitally stored, blinded to patient identity. Examinations were&#xD;
      analyzed off-line by one experienced observer using EchoPAC version 1.12.0 (GE, Vingmed). All&#xD;
      analysis was done with a sweep speed of 67 mm/s and recordings were measured and averaged&#xD;
      from 3 consecutive heartbeats. Examinations with poor image quality and patients with atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation were excluded from the analyses. Left ventricular- and atrial volumes were&#xD;
      estimated using the Simpsons biplane method of discs in the 4- and 2 chamber views and&#xD;
      ejection fraction was calculated. Mitral inflow pattern was estimated in the apical four&#xD;
      chamber view and pattern of peak early (E) and peak atrial (A) velocities were measured. E/A&#xD;
      ratio was calculated by dividing E by A. Mitral annular velocities were estimated in the&#xD;
      apical 4- and 2 chamber view using pulsed wave tissue Doppler imaging. A pulsed wave Doppler&#xD;
      sample volume was placed at the level of the mitral annulus first in the lateral wall, then&#xD;
      in the septum and finally in the anterior- and posterior wall. Using tissue Doppler imaging&#xD;
      peak early (EÂ´), peak systolic (SÂ´) mitral annular velocities were estimated. E/EÂ´ ratio was&#xD;
      obtained by dividing E by EÂ´.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strain analyses Longitudinal systolic strain was measured by speckle tracking&#xD;
      echocardiography. This was obtained from 2D gray scale images of the apical 4-chamber,&#xD;
      2-chamber and long-axis view with optimized focus on the left ventricle and frame rate â¥ 69&#xD;
      frames/sec. Duration of systole was defined in the 5-chamber apical view by marking aorta&#xD;
      valve opening and closure from the continuous wave Doppler curve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strain analyses were done in EchoPAC version 1.12.0 (GE, Vingmed) with the Q-analysis&#xD;
      software. The left ventricular borderline was manually traced in each apical plane and&#xD;
      tracking of motion was automatically done by the software. Peak systolic strain was&#xD;
      determined in all 18 segments from the three apical views. Global strain for the left&#xD;
      ventricle was provided by the software as the average value of the peak systolic longitudinal&#xD;
      strain of the three apical views. Strain of the infarct zone was calculated as the mean value&#xD;
      of the segments supplied by the culprit vessel&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time to intensive statin bolus:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to the intensive care group were given a loading bolus of rosuvastatin 80&#xD;
      mg as soon as possible after admission and continued intensive treatment with 40 mg daily.&#xD;
      Patients randomized to the usual care group were treated after current guidelines with&#xD;
      simvastatin 40 mg daily and started statin therapy before discharge from the hospital.&#xD;
      Patients treated intensively were divided in two groups. A very early statin group receiving&#xD;
      statin treatment before 12 hours after admission and an early statin group receiving statin&#xD;
      after 12 hours but before 24 hours from admission to the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MSCT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators performed a contrast enhanced Cardiac CT (MSCT) at randomization and after&#xD;
      12 month. The investigators used a standardized protocol at every examination and detailed&#xD;
      method description can be seen elsewhere.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biochemistry:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood was drawn at baseline before randomization and after 30 days. The investigators&#xD;
      measured lipid-profile HBA1C, Creatinin, ALAT and CK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses Continuous outcome variables are presented as mean Â± standard deviation&#xD;
      (SD). Changes in outcome variables from baseline to follow-up are presented as Delta (â)&#xD;
      values (follow-up values - baseline values) Differences between groups are analyzed with an&#xD;
      unpaired Students t-test with unequal variance. The investigators used multiple linear&#xD;
      regressions in order to adjust for potential confounders. The investigators defined the&#xD;
      confounders to be: Baseline left ventricular output variable, diabetes, hypertension,&#xD;
      hypercholesterolemia, prior statin treatment, history of ACS, type of infarction, type of&#xD;
      invasive treatment, culprit vessel, beta-blockers, ACE/ARB-inhibitors and time from symptoms&#xD;
      to invasive treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous exposure variables are presented as median and lower and upper quartiles and&#xD;
      categorical data as frequencies and percentages. Difference in exposure variables were tested&#xD;
      with Krushal-Wallis test for continuous variables and for categorical variables with&#xD;
      Fischer's exact test. Statistical tests were two-sided, and a P-value &lt; 0.05 was considered&#xD;
      to be statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using STATA version&#xD;
      12 (StataCorp LP, Collage Station, TX, USA)&#xD;
