  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to the Census &amp; Statistics Department (2011), there are still 659,300 daily smokers&#xD;
      (11.1%) in Hong Kong. Smoking and passive smoking kill over 7,000 people per year. Smoking is&#xD;
      addictive, and it is difficult for some motivated smokers to quit without assistance. On the&#xD;
      other hand, many smokers may not be ready to quit or want to quit on their own, so it is&#xD;
      difficult to reach them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quit and Win programme is an opportunity to reach and encourage a large group of smokers to&#xD;
      make quit attempt. Quit and Win Contest assumes that smokers can develop a higher motivation&#xD;
      to quit and gain a wider social support in quitting. According to Cahill and Petera (2011),&#xD;
      smokers can develop a high motivation to quit and gain a wider social support through&#xD;
      participating in the Quit and Win Contest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Hong Kong Council on Smoking and Health (COSH) organized three &quot;Quit to Win Contests&quot; and&#xD;
      recruited over 3000 smokers from 2009-2012. These events enhanced the motivation and&#xD;
      confidence to quit smoking. Lucky draw was also conducted to attract smokers to quit smoking&#xD;
      and winners were validated by biochemical tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) is an partnership approach that can enlighten&#xD;
      and utilize the network within communities as community partners can obtain ample manpower&#xD;
      and social resources. To effectively raise the awareness of the contest and recruit as many&#xD;
      participants as we can from the community, working with NGOs in the 18 Hong Kong districts&#xD;
      with a CBPR model may be one effective way of program implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, we proposed to (1) test the effectiveness of combining competition and short-term&#xD;
      monetary incentives to motivate smokers who participate in the Quit to Win Contest 2013 to&#xD;
      quit smoking; (2) use a Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) model to build capacity&#xD;
      and to engage community partners in taking on this important public health issue for&#xD;
      sustainability in the community; and (3) conduct the process evaluation to assess the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the recruitment activity and how it is linked with the overall program&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine the effectiveness of the interventions, three arms are (i) Group A: Informed early&#xD;
      monetary incentive, which participants will be notified of the incentive through telephone&#xD;
      follow-up at 1-week and 1-month follow-ups; (ii) Group B: Uninformed early monetary&#xD;
      incentive, which participants will not be informed about the incentive until 3-month&#xD;
      telephone follow-up; (iii) Group C (control group): Uninformed late monetary incentive, which&#xD;
      participants will not be informed about the incentive throughout 1-week, 1-month and 3-month&#xD;
      follow-ups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcomes are the self-reported 7-day point prevalence (pp) quit rate at 3 months&#xD;
      of group A compared to group B and group C. The secondary outcomes include (i) self-reported&#xD;
      7-day point prevalence (pp) quit rate at 6 months, (ii) biochemical validated quit rates,&#xD;
      (iii) rate of smoking reduction by at least half of baseline amount, (iv) number of quit&#xD;
      attempts at 3 and 6 months among the three groups and (v) the above cessation outcomes of all&#xD;
      subjects, including or not including in the RCT.&#xD;

      According to the report of Census &amp; Statistics Department (Census &amp; Statistics Department&#xD;
      (Hong Kong SAR government), 2011), there are still 659,300 daily smokers (11.1%) in Hong&#xD;
      Kong. Smoking and passive smoking kills over 7,000 people per year (Lam, Ho, Hedley, Mak, &amp;&#xD;
      Peto, 2001). Smoking also led to an annual medical cost, long-term care and productivity loss&#xD;
      of US$688 million in 1998 (McGhee et al., 2006), which was equivalent to 0.6% of GDP in the&#xD;
      region (Census &amp; Statistics Department (Hong Kong SAR government), 2001). Smoking is&#xD;
      addictive, and it is difficult for some motivated smokers to quit without assistance. On the&#xD;
      other hand, many smokers may not be ready to quit or want to quit on their own, so it is&#xD;
      difficult to reach them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Quit and Win programme provides an opportunity to reach and encourage a large group of&#xD;
      smokers to make quit attempt, in order to increase the number of quitters. This Quit and Win&#xD;
      model assumes that smokers can develop a higher motivation to quit and gain a wider social&#xD;
      support in quitting thru participating in this kind of contests (Cahill &amp; Petera, 2011). Such&#xD;
      quitting contests or incentive programs appeared to reach a large number of smokers, and&#xD;
      demonstrated a significantly higher quit rate for the quit and win group than for the control&#xD;
      group (Cahill &amp; Rafael, 2008). Cognitive theory suggested that immediate incentive exerts&#xD;
      more influence than delayed reward for implementing more patient preferences (Berns, Laibson,&#xD;
      &amp; Loewenstein, 2007). Some critics echoed this by considering to reward the participants who&#xD;
      were abstinent or achieved other cessation outcomes in the early stage of the quitting&#xD;
      process, instead of a later cessation outcome (Aveyard &amp; Bauld, 2011). Among the three&#xD;
      overseas studies attempted to combine short-term monetary reward and competition as the&#xD;
      incentive for abstinence (Glasgow, Hollis, Ary, &amp; Boles, 1993; Hennrikus, Jeffery, Lando, &amp;&#xD;
      Murray, 2002; Koffman, Lee, Hopp, &amp; Emont, 1998), Koffman's study in the workplace supported&#xD;
      that participants with short-term incentives had a higher quit rate at 6 months than others&#xD;
      without the incentives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2009, we conducted a 3-armed randomized controlled trial to compare the effectiveness of&#xD;
      two additional interventions of a 3-minute brief telephone advice and 8 mobile phone messages&#xD;
      to the usual care of smoking cessation self-help material in the Quit to Win Contest 2009&#xD;
      (Chan, 2011). More than one thousand participants were successfully recruited in a period of&#xD;
      one and half months, with an overall self-reported quit rate of 21.6% among the contestants.&#xD;
      However, the additional brief telephone advice or the SMS messages did not show a higher quit&#xD;
      rate than control group. In 2010, we conducted another RCT on the Quit to Win Contest 2010 to&#xD;
      compare the effectiveness of an on-site face-to-face brief smoking cessation advice versus&#xD;
      self-help materials (control) on quit rate and changes in smoking behaviors. Once again, we&#xD;
      recruited over one thousand participants during a period of 2.5 months. A higher quit rate&#xD;
      was observed in the intervention group (18.4%), in which participants received an on-site&#xD;
      brief counselling, than the control group (13.8%) at 6-month follow-up, although it was&#xD;
      marginally statistically insignificant (p = 0.08) (Wong &amp; Chan, 2012). In 2012, the RCT in&#xD;
      the Quit to Win Contest tested the effectiveness of the on-site counselling with telephone&#xD;
      boosters and health education card theoretically based on the Health Action Process Approach&#xD;
      for the intervention group (Schwarzer, 2008). HAPA suggests that one's intention of behaviour&#xD;
      change can be fostered by knowing that the new behaviour has positive outcomes as opposed to&#xD;
      the negative outcomes that accompany the current behaviour; and planning (action planning and&#xD;
      coping planning) serves as an operative mediator between intentions and behaviour. In&#xD;
      addition, another SMS intervention group received 16 SMS about cessation advice and&#xD;
      motivation within one month. The quit rates for these two intervention groups were 9.4% and&#xD;
      11.5%, respectively, but they did not differ from the control group significantly (9.7%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The three Quit to Win Contests in Hong Kong recruited over 3,000 smokers from the community&#xD;
      who otherwise might not even think about quitting smoking. On the other hand, the engagement&#xD;
      in the competition boosted up the confidence and motivation to quit among smokers who joined&#xD;
      the Quit to Win contest, but additional counselling and short messaging services did not&#xD;
      increase the quit rate. All the three contests conducted a lucky draw to select a few prize&#xD;
      winners whose abstinence was validated by biochemical tests. In accordance with the research&#xD;
      direction suggested by the above foreign studies, the forthcoming RCT on Quit to Win Contest&#xD;
      will explore the effectiveness of short-term monetary incentives combined with the prizes of&#xD;
      the lucky draws.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) is a partnership approach in a scientific&#xD;
      research that involves the collaboration among community partners and academic researchers&#xD;
      throughout the research process (Israel, Schulz, &amp; Parker, 1998). It has been found effective&#xD;
      in enhancing community input, building community capacity, and addressing barriers to health&#xD;
      in study participants who have historically been underrepresented in research (Andrews,&#xD;
      Newman, Heath, Williams, &amp; Tingen, 2012; Horowitz, Robinson, &amp; Seifer, 2009). Community&#xD;
      partners have the capability of mobilizing local social resources and manpower, and utilizing&#xD;
      their network within the community, which are beneficial to a scientific research involving&#xD;
      population-based interventions. To effectively raise the awareness of the contest and recruit&#xD;
      as many participants as we can from the community, working with NGOs in the 18 Hong Kong&#xD;
      districts with a CBPR model may be one effective way of program implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The challenge of applying the CBPR model in the smoking cessation program is to equip the&#xD;
      staff from NGOs and HKU about the related skills and knowledge, and maintain the quality of&#xD;
      research process and intervention. Process evaluation is a systematic procedure during the&#xD;
      delivery of public health interventions in order to understand how well the program does and&#xD;
      to link the progress to outcomes (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2008). In&#xD;
      addition to the training programme and briefing session to be provided to the participating&#xD;
      NGOs, monitoring and documentation are needed throughout the recruitment and research process&#xD;
      so that the quality and integrity of the effort by the involved NGOs can be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To conclude, we proposed to (1) test the effectiveness of combining competition and&#xD;
      short-term monetary incentives to motivate smokers who participate in the Quit to Win Contest&#xD;
      2013 to quit smoking; (2) use a Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) model to build&#xD;
      capacity and to engage community partners in taking on this important public health issue for&#xD;
      sustainability in the community; and (3) conduct the process evaluation to assess the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the recruitment activity and how it is linked with the overall program&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
