    <textblock>
      Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV t-PA) is the only proven treatment of hyperacute&#xD;
      cerebral infarction. The outcome of this treatment highly depends on the time from symptom&#xD;
      onset to the administration of thrombolytic agent. Last known normal time is widely used as&#xD;
      the standard to determine the symptom onset. These stroke symptoms are usually caused by a&#xD;
      sudden decrease in cerebral blood flow related with an embolic or thrombotic event. However,&#xD;
      in some cases various symptoms may occur one after another.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myocardial infarction is also caused by a sudden caseation of blood flow. The symptom of&#xD;
      myocardial infarction usually contains chest pain, and it is easy to identify the exact time&#xD;
      of onset. In contrast, cerebral infarction may cause various symptoms according to the&#xD;
      infarcted area of the brain, and sometimes multiple symptoms are presented in rapid&#xD;
      succession. Therefore, it may be much unclear and uncertain to determine the onset time of&#xD;
      cerebral infarction. Despite the importance of onset time in therapeutic decision making,&#xD;
      there was no study focusing on the certainty of onset time in cerebral infarction patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we will investigate the subjective certainty of patient about the onset time&#xD;
      in clear-onset cerebral ischemia. The discrepancy in diagnosing the onset time will be&#xD;
      analyzed among the clinicians involved in the practice. Then, the factors associated with&#xD;
      this uncertainty will be verified.&#xD;

      On the day after admission, the patients will be re-interviewed by a stroke neurologist&#xD;
      during the rounding in the morning. First the history of symptom onset will be re-taken once&#xD;
      more, focusing on the presentation of each neurological symptom. Then the history taken from&#xD;
      the emergency department including the onset time will be presented to the patient, and the&#xD;
      patient will be asked to choose the certainty for the onset time between 1 and 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The symptom onset judged by the neurologist first assessed at the emergency department will&#xD;
      be compared to that of the stroke neurologist re-interviewed after admission. If any&#xD;
      discrepancy exists, the history of the patient will be re-written by the stroke neurologist&#xD;
      and then reviewed by five experienced stroke neurologist. The judgment on stroke onset and&#xD;
      the certainty of each stroke neurologist will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical variables will be obtained from the patient. The informant will be the patient.&#xD;
      Demographics including the age and sex will be obtained. Additionally the year of education&#xD;
      will be investigated. The situation of stroke onset will be obtained in detail. What the&#xD;
      patient was doing immediately before the onset, the place, and the person accompanied with&#xD;
      will also be investigated. These will be described on the re-written history which will be&#xD;
      reviewed by the five stroke neurologists. The conventional risk factors for stroke and the&#xD;
      stroke etiology according to the TOAST classification will be acquired. The initial severity&#xD;
      of stroke will also be obtained evaluated by National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale&#xD;
      (NIHSS). On the second interview and the re-written history, the symptoms will be&#xD;
      investigated in detail. First as an open question, and then targeting the stroke symptoms and&#xD;
      the onset of them will be asked. The symptom includes 1) weakness, 2) facial palsy 3)&#xD;
      dysarthria 4) ataxia 5) visual field defect 6) sensory change 7) dizziness 8) headache and 9)&#xD;
      Other non-specific symptoms. The onset time and the sequence will be investigated by each&#xD;
      symptom.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The result will be analyzed in two view points. First the discrepancy rate between clinicians&#xD;
      will be first examined, and the clinical variables making difference will be analyzed.&#xD;
      finally a protocol for systemized history taking of stroke onset will be used, and the change&#xD;
      will be analyzed before and after the release of protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second point of veiw, the certainty of patient will be analyzed. The clinical&#xD;
      variables will be compared according to the certainty of patient on symptom onset.&#xD;
