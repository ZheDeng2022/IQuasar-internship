    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the bioequivalence as well as safety and tolerability of a novel 30&#xD;
      mg tablet of nifurtimox compared to the corresponding marketed 120 mg tablet in adult&#xD;
      subjects suffering from chronic Chagas' disease when administered after a high-fat /&#xD;
      high-calorie test meal. This study is a necessary step for the development of an age&#xD;
      appropriate pediatric oral dosage form for the treatment of Chagas' disease in endemic&#xD;
      countries according to the recommendations provided by current international guidelines (EMA&#xD;
      Guideline on Clinical Development of Medicinal Products, EMA Note for Guidance on Oral Dosage&#xD;
      Forms).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Upon consent, women of childbearing potential must use 2 forms of highly effective&#xD;
             contraception for the duration of the study and for 12 weeks after the last drug&#xD;
             administration. The definition of highly effective contraception will be left at the&#xD;
             discretion of the investigator and will be in line with ICH Topic M 3 (R2):&#xD;
             Non-Clinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing&#xD;
             Authorization for Pharmaceuticals&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male subjects who are sterile, not sexually active or agree to use 2 forms of highly&#xD;
             effective contraception during the study and for 12 weeks after receiving the study&#xD;
             drug. The definition of highly effective contraception will be left at the discretion&#xD;
             of the investigator and will be in line with ICH ICH Topic M 3 (R2): Non-Clinical&#xD;
             Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization&#xD;
             for Pharmaceuticals&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male/female subject diagnosed with chronic Chagas' disease: Previous diagnosis of&#xD;
             acute or chronic Chagas' disease by a health clinic prior to screening for the study.&#xD;
             The diagnosis of chronic Chagas' disease may be made by clinical findings, supported&#xD;
             by antibody titers if available. If there is a known history of acute disease, it is&#xD;
             preferable to have documentation of parasites on the blood smear if available&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age: 18 to 45 years (inclusive) at the first screening visit&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Incompletely cured pre-existing diseases (except chronic Chagas) for which it can be&#xD;
             assumed that the absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination and effects of the&#xD;
             study drugs will not be normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acute Chagas'disease (During the acute phase, the parasite on a blood smear may be&#xD;
             seen under a microscope. Different antibodies are present, depending on the course of&#xD;
             the disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known hypersensitivity to the study drugs (active substances or excipients of the&#xD;
             preparations)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unstable or uncontrolled medical condition such as hypertension or diabetes;&#xD;
             decompensated heart failure, gastrointestinal (GI) conditions that would interfere&#xD;
             with the absorption of the study drug (e.g. GI ulceration, peptic ulceration, GI&#xD;
             bleeding, gastroesophageal reflux, or other GI disease affecting gastroesophageal&#xD;
             junction), conditions that could potentially have an impact on drug metabolism ar&#xD;
             elimination (renal, hepatic such as known hepatic or biliary abnormalities), or any&#xD;
             clinically relevant active infections in the opinion of the investigator within 4&#xD;
             weeks before the screening visit e.g. clinically relevant history or presence of&#xD;
             significant respiratory (e.g., interstitial lung disease), hematological, lymphatic,&#xD;
             neurological, cardiovascular, psychiatric, musculoskeletal, genitourinary,&#xD;
             immunological, metabolic (e.g., diabetes), and dermatological or connective tissue&#xD;
             disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of systemic or topical medicines or substances which oppose the study objectives&#xD;
             or which might influence them within 4 weeks before the first study drug&#xD;
             administration, e.g. an investigational drug, any drug altering gastrointestinal&#xD;
             motility and /or gastric pH (e.g. antacids, anticholinergic, para-sympatholytics), any&#xD;
             drug known to induce liver enzymes (e.g. dexamethasone, barbiturates, St. John's Wort&#xD;
             [hypericum perforatum]), any drug known to inhibit liver enzymes (e.g. ketoconazole,&#xD;
             macrolides)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically relevant findings in the electrocardiogram (ECG) such as a second- or&#xD;
             third-degree AV block, prolongation of the QRS complex over 120 msec or of the&#xD;
             QTc-interval over 450 msec&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Systolic blood pressure below 100 or above 140 mmHg (after at least 15 min supine)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diastolic blood pressure below 50 or above 90 mmHg (after at least 15 min supine)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Heart rate below 45 or above 95 beats / min (after at least 15 min supine)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Findings that would exclude the subject in the physician's judgment e.g. enlarged&#xD;
             liver, irregular heartbeat, undiagnosed acute illness, melanoma&#xD;
