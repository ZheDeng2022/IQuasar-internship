    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the relative bioavailability of ASP015K under&#xD;
      fasting conditions after single-dose administration between a test-tablet formulation and a&#xD;
      reference-tablet formulation. This study will also evaluate the food effect on&#xD;
      bioavailability of the test formulation, and evaluate the safety and tolerability after&#xD;
      single-dose administration of the test- and reference-tablet formulations.&#xD;
