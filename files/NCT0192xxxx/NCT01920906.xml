      Psoriasis is a chronic, debilitating skin disorder with an estimated prevalence of 2%.&#xD;
      Psoriatic skin lesions start with initial pinhead-sized macules and then coalesce into&#xD;
      plaques of varying sizes. Despite the great strides in the studies for psoriasis, it is still&#xD;
      unclear why psoriatic skin lesions start with small macules and then spread peripherally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study peripheral spreading of psoriasis, investigators plan to study small plaque&#xD;
      psoriasis in comparison to large plaque psoriasis in the Korean population. Large plaque&#xD;
      psoriasis is the most common form of psoriasis, seen in approximately 90% of all psoriasis&#xD;
      participants. Large psoriatic plaques are &gt;5 cm in size and localize to the extensor aspects&#xD;
      of the elbows, knees, scalp, and genital area. On the other hand, small plaque psoriasis is&#xD;
      the common or typical form of psoriasis that occurs particularly in Korea and other Asian&#xD;
      countries. Korean small plaque psoriasis, even when chronic, remains &lt;2 cm in size and is&#xD;
      widely distributed on the upper trunk and proximal extremities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators hypothesize that the expression of immune-related genes are different between&#xD;
      small and large plaque psoriasis. The study of a genetically homogeneous cohort,&#xD;
      characterized by the relatively high prevalence of small plaque psoriasis in the Korean&#xD;
      population, may filter out spurious signals while allowing for significant associations to&#xD;
      emerge from a relatively low number of participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By comparing small and large plaque psoriasis, it is expected this study could lead to new&#xD;
      understandings of the mechanisms involved in spreading of psoriatic plaques and provide new&#xD;
      insights into psoriasis development.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Psoriasis is a common chronic skin disorder with an estimated prevalence in populations of&#xD;
      approximately 2%. Psoriatic skin lesions start with initial pinhead-sized macules and then&#xD;
      coalesce into plaques of varying sizes in diameter from one to several centimeters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the great strides in the studies for psoriasis, it is still unclear why psoriatic&#xD;
      skin lesions start with small macules and then spread peripherally. The occurrence of&#xD;
      psoriasis is thought to be the pathological consequence of an exaggerated immune response as&#xD;
      activated T cells, monocytes, neutrophils, and dendritic cells produce inflammatory cytokines&#xD;
      that drive the additional recruitment of inflammatory cells, further elaboration of&#xD;
      proinflammatory mediators, and the proliferation of keratinocytes. However, pathogenetic&#xD;
      mechanism for peripheral spreading of psoriasis needs to be further elucidated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study peripheral spreading of psoriasis, investigators plan to study &quot;small plaque&#xD;
      psoriasis&quot; and compare it to &quot;large plaque psoriasis&quot; in the Korean population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psoriasis vulgaris, so-called &quot;large plaque psoriasis&quot;, is the most common form of psoriasis,&#xD;
      seen in approximately 90% of all psoriasis patients. Red, scaly, symmetrically distributed&#xD;
      plaques are usually larger than 5 cm in diameter and characteristically localized to the&#xD;
      extensor aspects of the extremities, particularly the elbows and knees, along with scalp,&#xD;
      lower lumbosacral, buttocks, and genital involvement. Approximately 1/4 to 1/3 of large&#xD;
      plaque psoriasis participants have involvement of over 5% of their body surface area (BSA),&#xD;
      and disease of this extent is frequently painful and physically and/or socially debilitating&#xD;
      to a degree comparable with other chronic medical conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, &quot;small plaque psoriasis&quot; is the common or typical form of psoriasis that&#xD;
      occurs in adults particularly in Korea and other Asian countries. Korean small plaque&#xD;
      psoriasis, even when chronic, remain &lt;2 cm in size and widely distributed on upper trunk and&#xD;
      proximal extremities. Small plaque psoriasis is less severe than large plaque psoriasis, as&#xD;
      it usually responds to phototherapy and more potent therapies are rarely needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is also noteworthy that there are well-known human leukocyte antigen (HLA) differences in&#xD;
      Caucasians in comparison with Asian participants with psoriasis, and a unique HLA haplotype&#xD;
      has been described in Korean participants with psoriasis. Furthermore, an allele of an&#xD;
      HLA-related gene, known as major histocompatibility complex I chain-related gene A, is known&#xD;
      as a susceptibility marker in Korean and Chinese participants with psoriasis, but not in&#xD;
      Spanish participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For a more comprehensive analysis of the difference between small and large plaque psoriasis,&#xD;
      investigators plan to compare these two different types of psoriasis only in the Korean&#xD;
      population. The study of a genetically homogeneous cohort, characterized by the relatively&#xD;
      high prevalence of small plaque psoriasis in the Korean population, may filter out spurious&#xD;
      signals while allowing for significant associations to emerge from a relatively low number of&#xD;
      participants. By comparing Korean psoriasis participants in two geographically separated&#xD;
      locations (Seoul, Korea vs. New York, NY, USA), it will also be interesting to understand the&#xD;
      interactions between genetics and the environment that are still not well defined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is anticipated this study could lead to new understanding of the mechanisms involved in&#xD;
      the spreading of psoriatic plaques and provide new insight into psoriasis pathogenesis.&#xD;
