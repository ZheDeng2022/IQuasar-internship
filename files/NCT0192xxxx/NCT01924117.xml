      Objective: Determine the genotypes and risk factors associated with human papilloma virus&#xD;
      infection in Mexican women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: It was a cross-sectional study of women attended at the Materno-Perinatal Hospital&#xD;
      &quot;Mónica Pretelini&quot; and the Medical Research Center (CICMED), who were asked to complete a&#xD;
      risk factor questionnaire and submitted to colposcopy to identify SIL. Cervical swab samples&#xD;
      were obtained to perform linear array HPV genotyping test (Roche®, Mannheim, Germany).&#xD;

      Principles: The aim of this study was to determine the HPV genotypes in squamous&#xD;
      intraepithelial lesions (SIL) in a population sample of the State of Mexico.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria were women submitted to a colposcopy study at the Clinic 221 of the&#xD;
      Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS), Maternal-Perinatal Hospital &quot;Monica Pretelini&quot;&#xD;
      (HMPMP), State of Mexico Health Institute (ISEM) and the Medical Research Center (CICMED),&#xD;
      Autonomous University of State of México (UAEMex). Women with previous conization were not&#xD;
      considered into the study and those whose clinical follow up was lost were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sociodemographic factors:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were given a questionnaire to measure the following potential risk factors: age,&#xD;
      area of residence, education level, sexual partners, participation in anal sex, age at first&#xD;
      intercourse, smoking, use of hormonal contraception, use of condoms, number of pregnancies&#xD;
      and vaginal deliveries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cervical samples:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples were collected by cervical scraping and were preserved in ThinPrep® PreservCyt®&#xD;
      Solution (HologicTM Marlborough, Massachusetts, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      HPV genotyping:&#xD;
&#xD;
      DNA extraction from the cervical swab samples was performed using the Amplicor kit (Roche®,&#xD;
      Mannheim, Germany), isolating simultaneously the β-globin gene along with HPV. HPV positive&#xD;
      specimens were subsequently genotyped using the Linear Array HPV Genotyping assay (Roche®,&#xD;
      Mannheim, Germany). This test is a qualitative in vitro test for the detection of HPV&#xD;
      utilizing amplification of target DNA by the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and nucleic acid&#xD;
      hybridization able to detect 37 anogenital HPV DNA genotypes (6, 11, 16, 18, 26, 31, 33, 35,&#xD;
      39, 40, 42, 45, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 58, 59, 61, 62, 64, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73&#xD;
      (MM9), 81, 82 (MM4), 83 (MM7), 84 (MM8), IS39 and CP6108). This technique can detect multiple&#xD;
      HPV genotypes in the same sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical concerns:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We followed the Declaration of Helsinki and all patients were asked to sign the written&#xD;
      informed consent. This study was accepted by the Research and Ethical Committee of the&#xD;
      CICMED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, descriptive analyzes were performed, secondly, Odds Ratios (OR) and their associated&#xD;
      95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated as well as Chi-square tests and conditional&#xD;
      regression model for SIL using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) 17.0&#xD;
      software. Difference was considered significant at p ≤ 0.05.&#xD;
