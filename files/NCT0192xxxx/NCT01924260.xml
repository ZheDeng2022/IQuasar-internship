      This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of alisertib when given&#xD;
      together with gemcitabine hydrochloride in treating patients with solid tumors or pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer that is metastatic or cannot be removed by surgery. Alisertib may stop the growth of&#xD;
      tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of&#xD;
      tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving alisertib&#xD;
      with gemcitabine hydrochloride may be an effective treatment for solid tumors or pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To investigate the feasibility and safety of MLN8237 (alisertib) when given in combination&#xD;
      with gemcitabine (gemcitabine hydrochloride) to patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of MLN8237 when given in combination with&#xD;
      gemcitabine to patients with advanced solid tumors and to recommend a phase II dose for the&#xD;
      combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To obtain preliminary evidence of efficacy as judged by response rate and&#xD;
      progression-free survival for this combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To investigate the pharmacokinetics of MLN8237 given in combination with gemcitabine in&#xD;
      an expanded cohort of patients with pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of alisertib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 8,&#xD;
      and 15 and alisertib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17. Courses&#xD;
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.&#xD;
