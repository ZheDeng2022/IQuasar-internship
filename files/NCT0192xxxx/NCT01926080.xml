  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Experts agree that neonatal death has long-term impact on parents. Many parents experience&#xD;
      sadness, pain, anger, bouts of crying, and a depressed mood after the death of a child. There&#xD;
      are no prospective studies that evaluate the effectiveness of bereavement management and&#xD;
      follow-up on the grief process following the death of a newborn. The purpose of this study is&#xD;
      to evaluate the impact of a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) bereavement support program&#xD;
      and the use of a newly designed family-centered bereavement DVD. This educational DVD&#xD;
      includes personal interviews with parents, grandparents and siblings who have experienced the&#xD;
      lost of a baby in the NICU.&#xD;

      The care given to a family before and following a neonatal loss can set the stage for a&#xD;
      family's entire grieving process. For many parents, the support they receive from health care&#xD;
      providers after the loss of a baby may have crucial effects on the family's ability to&#xD;
      appropriately respond. It is essential for nurses, practitioners, physicians, and chaplains&#xD;
      to provide compassionate care that meets or exceeds parents' expectations. However,&#xD;
      supporting families following the death of an infant is particularly challenging. There is&#xD;
      limited bereavement intervention guidance in the literature that may benefit grieving&#xD;
      parents. Follow-up care is a crucial part of bereavement management of families whose babies&#xD;
      have died. The bereavement committee at St. Louis Children's Hospital (SLCH) is a&#xD;
      multi-disciplinary team, which includes representation from neonatal nurses and nurse&#xD;
      practitioners, neonatologists, social workers, chaplains, patient-care associates, and former&#xD;
      bereaved parents. Their role is to assist families both at the time of an infant's death and&#xD;
      in securing their baby's personal belongings after the family leaves the hospital. In&#xD;
      addition to receiving bereavement materials, which is considered standard-practice of care in&#xD;
      the NICU at SLCH following the death of an infant, half of the parents enrolled in the study&#xD;
      will be prospectively randomized to receive the educational bereavement DVD entitled&#xD;
      'Grieving in the NICU- Mending Broken Hearts When a Baby Dies Too Soon'.&#xD;
