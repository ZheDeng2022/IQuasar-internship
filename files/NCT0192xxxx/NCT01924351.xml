      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if treatment with SRS followed by a HER-2 directed therapy regimen results in a&#xD;
      6-month distant brain relapse rate of less than 30%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Describe the natural history of neurocognitive function for women with brain metastases&#xD;
           treated with SRS and HER-2 directed systemic therapy and establish a reference benchmark&#xD;
           to generate hypothesis for future design of a phase III trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Describe patterns of distant brain relapse after SRS for all patients and compare them&#xD;
           between (a) patients with 1-3 vs. 4-10 brain metastasis and (b) between patients treated&#xD;
           with each systemic therapy regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Describe patterns of neurologic death&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Describe patterns of local brain relapse&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Describe patterns of re-irradiation with WBRT or SRS&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Describe adverse events&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Metastatic breast cancer is a leading cause of death for women. HER2(human epidermal growth&#xD;
      factor receptor type 2)-positive disease represents a more aggressive type of breast cancer&#xD;
      which often afflicts younger patients. As many as one-third of patients with HER2-positive&#xD;
      breast cancer develop brain metastasis[1]. The development of brain metastasis in this young&#xD;
      female population is particularly devastating as they are often highly functional and may&#xD;
      have young children. Improvement in quality of life by preventing neurocognitive decline from&#xD;
      disease progression and/or treatment related side effects is paramount.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with 1-10 brain metastasis from HER2+ breast cancer, after informed consent, will be&#xD;
      treated with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiosurgery: Gamma-knife, Cyberknife, or linac-based SRS is followed by anti-HER2 based&#xD;
      systemic therapy, with the treatment selection of approved agents at the physician's&#xD;
      discretion. Possible anti-HER2 agents include trastuzumab, pertuzumab, trastuzumab-emtansine,&#xD;
      or lapatinib. Anti-HER2 therapy will be delivered in combination with appropriate cytotoxic&#xD;
      therapy as per FDA indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anti-HER2 based systemic therapy will continue until progression, patient discontinuation,&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity or if, in the view of the physician it is no longer indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI and neurocognitive testing will be done prior to SRS and repeated every 3 months during&#xD;
      the first 6 months from enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients can only be enrolled after all eligibility criteria are met. The date of&#xD;
      registration/enrollment is considered to be the day the Eligibility Checklist is signed by&#xD;
      the verifying physician. Once a patient is enrolled, a unique case number will be assigned to&#xD;
      the patient.&#xD;
