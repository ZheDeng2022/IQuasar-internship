      &quot;Mortality related to complications of cirrhosis, (hemorrhage, hepatic insufficiency and&#xD;
      primary liver cancer) is 15,000 per year in France. These mortality increases, despite that&#xD;
      advanced fibrosis can be identified by non-invasive biomarkers and treated, more than 10&#xD;
      years before the onset of complications and cancer. The main goals of the FIBROFRANCE project&#xD;
      which started in 1997 (initially called the MULTIVIRC group) were to demonstrate the&#xD;
      performance of serum biomarkers in the more frequent chronic liver diseases, to estimate the&#xD;
      dynamic of fibrosis progression and finally to demonstrate the feasibility of the fibrosis&#xD;
      screening in French people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The different cohorts of the FIBROFRANCE (HCV, HBV, ALD, NAFLD) permitted many publications&#xD;
      among the 186 publications of our group since 1986 in the field of liver fibrosis. These&#xD;
      publications included discovery and validation of non-invasive biomarkers (Poynard&#xD;
      Gastroenterology 1997, Imbert-Bismut Lancet 2001, Poynard BMC Gastro 2007), modelling&#xD;
      fibrosis progression or regression (Poynard Lancet 1997, Poynard Gastroenterology 2002,&#xD;
      Poynard J Hepatol 2003) and fibrosis screening (Ratziu APT 2007, Jacqueminet Clin&#xD;
      Gastrenterol Hepatol 2008). This research was conducted in Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital for the&#xD;
      biochemical and clinical part in connection with national and international networks. Several&#xD;
      panels have been identified and the most predictive FibroTest has been patented (US Patent&#xD;
      Office 6.631.330) and launched in 2002. This is the first fibrosis biomarker available&#xD;
      worldwide (50 countries including USA as FibroSURE) with more than 1 million prescriptions&#xD;
      between 2002-2013. FibroTest, has been validated first in hepatitis C and then in hepatitis B&#xD;
      alcoholic liver disease and metabolic syndrome. Therefore it is now possible to screen&#xD;
      advanced fibrosis in the 4 most frequent liver diseases: alcohol, hepatitis C and B, and&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome (diabetes, overweight, and hyperlipemia). For all the patients detected&#xD;
      there are therapeutic options to cure the fibrosis or to reduce the progression to cirrhosis&#xD;
      and cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FibroTest has been recommended as alternative to biopsy in several guidelines (AFEF, APASL,&#xD;
      EASL and CASLD) and more recently in US overview (Chou Annals 2013). It reimbursed in France&#xD;
      in chronic hepatitis C. Several factors of fibrosis progression can be present in the same&#xD;
      subject, i.e. an overweight and an excessive alcohol consumption. Therefore no realistic&#xD;
      screenng strategy can be conducted without taking into account the Interdependence of the&#xD;
      different risk factors. Three biomarkers of fibrosis-associated liver injuries have been&#xD;
      developed and validated in FIBROFRANCE cohorts: SteatoTest for steatosis (Poynard Comp&#xD;
      Hepatol 2005), NashTest for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (Poynard EASL 2006), and AshTest&#xD;
      for alcoholic steatohepatitis (Naveau J Hepatol 2006). For this purpose different cohorts&#xD;
      already used for diagnostic validation will be followed at long term for prognostic&#xD;
      validations: FIBROFRANCE-ALD (Naveau Hepatology 2010), FIBROFRANCE-NAFLD including&#xD;
      dyslipidemia cohort (Ratziu APT 2007) and diabetes cohort (Jacqueminet Clin Gastrenterol&#xD;
      Hepatol 2008). These cohorts will allow assessing the prevalence of fibrosis and the specific&#xD;
      risks of fibrosis progression imputable to steatosis and steatohepatitis.&#xD;

      &quot;This is the initial version of the FIBROFRANCE project which strated in 1997. Methods The&#xD;
      strategy chosen is to screen advanced fibrosis in several groups of patients with different&#xD;
      levels of risks in order to reconstruct the French prevalence thereafter. A national&#xD;
      screening will be suggested according to the identified risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rational and prior hypothesis The simple rational concept is to screen patients before&#xD;
      complications of cirrhosis. (Figure 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Figure 1: Fibrosis progression with five consecutive stages: F0 no fibrosis, F1 mild fibrosis&#xD;
      without septa, F2 moderate fibrosis with few septa, F3 severe fibrosis with many septa, F4&#xD;
      cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advanced fibrosis is defined by presence of stages F2-F3-F4. The aim of the study is to&#xD;
      demonstrate that the screening is possible at stage F2 many years before complications. From&#xD;
      previous modeling (Figure 2) we suggested that an efficient screening must start around the&#xD;
      age of 40 years for the majority of high-risk group and around 30 years old in HIV coinfected&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population included Five major groups and 15 cohorts of different populations at risk will be&#xD;
      included. Five groups at high risk will be included: patients with hepatitis C, B, heavy&#xD;
      alcohol drinkers and patients with metabolic risk factors diabetics and hyperlipemics. These&#xD;
      populations were chosen because a blood sample can be easily available. The higher number&#xD;
      will permit to reconstruct the French prevalence taking into account the major&#xD;
      characteristics of subjects included (age, gender, socio economic status) and the known&#xD;
      prevalence of some risk factors (HBV and HCV prevalence, diabetes, hyperlipemia and heavy&#xD;
      drinker's prevalence).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Characteristics of subjects and recorded items The following characteristics will be recorded&#xD;
      in all studies: age, gender, high-risk factor, fibrosis stage and activity grade. In all&#xD;
      FibroFrance ANR cohorts the following factors are recorded and will be used in the&#xD;
      sensitivity analysis of prevalence estimates: socio-economic status, body mass index, area of&#xD;
      residence, alcohol consumption, metabolic syndrome factors, cholesterol, triglycerides,&#xD;
      glucose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be recorded anonymously with a code number and declared to the CNIL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints The main endpoints are the French prevalence of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis.&#xD;
      The estimates will be calculated according to age and gender adjusted on the absence or&#xD;
      presence of high risk factors in the French population. Non-high risk group represents in&#xD;
      France 48,000,000 people and the high risk group 12,000,000 people. The non-high risk group&#xD;
      will be derived from the estimates in blood donors, free screening center, and social&#xD;
      security center after exclusion of the subjects with high-risk factors which are assessed in&#xD;
      these three cohorts: heavy drinkers, HBV, HIV, diabetes, hyperlipemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final target for a national screening will take into account the relative risks&#xD;
      attributed to the predicted steatosis and steato-hepatitis. Estimates of steatosis and&#xD;
      steatohepatitis will be secondary endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomarkers FibroTest-ActiTest, SteatoTest, NashTest, AshTest will be performed in the&#xD;
      reference laboratory (GHPS) using the recommended pre analytical and analytical procedures.&#xD;
      Results will provide the estimated stages and grades and if the results profile is at risk of&#xD;
      false positive and negative. All patients with advanced fibrosis identified with FibroTest&#xD;
      will be contacted by the Liver reference center to organize the management. Elastometry&#xD;
      (FibroScan) ultrasonography will be performed for all advanced fibrosis and endoscopy if&#xD;
      cirrhosis predicted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Prevalence will be expressed as mean with 95% confidence interval.&#xD;
      Sensitivity analyses will be performed to assess the impact of the following factors on the&#xD;
      prevalence estimates: socio economic status, body mass index, area of residence, non-heavy&#xD;
      drinkers (&lt;50g/day), metabolic syndrome factors (ATP III definition) in univariate and&#xD;
      multivariate analysis using multiple regression analysis, together with age and gender.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The feasibility of the project has been checked in patients with chronic hepatitis C, B as&#xD;
      well as in patients with alcoholic and non alcoholic liver steatosis (see Fibrochure in annex&#xD;
      for details and references).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk of false positive or false negative of FibroTest (FT), has been also checked on&#xD;
      large populations of hepatitis C and in blood donors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These studies allow us to expand the screening to community based populations. Blood donors&#xD;
      (BD) Security algorithms (SA) were used at the time of calculating FT to alert users and&#xD;
      correct a potential error of data entry for each 6 FT components in different cohorts. One&#xD;
      SA1 detects abnormal values (AV) outside the 98% percentiles. Another SA2 detects, HR profile&#xD;
      of false positive (HR-FP) or false negative (HR-FN) serum, defined as a serum for which the&#xD;
      switch of one component by the median value of this particular component, is associated with&#xD;
      a dramatic change in the FT, greater than +0.30.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 954 Blood Donors (HBV, HCV, HIV neg) were prospectively included; BMI, daily&#xD;
      alcohol consumption and treatment were assessed. FT was performed on fresh serum according to&#xD;
      analytical recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mean age of pts was 50 yrs, 45% female. SA2 detected 3,965 tests (5.05%) with HR profile. The&#xD;
      most frequent AV observed was haptoglobin &lt;0.12 g/L in 3,562 pts (4.53%), but among them&#xD;
      there was only 614 HR-FP cases (0.78%) suspect of hemolysis, for which the other components&#xD;
      were not concordant in favor of significant fibrosis. HR-FP due to possible Gilbert Syndrome&#xD;
      was observed in 921 (1.17%). Mean age of BD was 36 yrs, 49% female, BMI 23.4 Kg/M2; 265 (28%)&#xD;
      received treatment: 125 (13%) oestro-progestative (OP), 20 (2%) hypolipemiant, 16 (2%)&#xD;
      anti-histaminic, 11 (1%) thyroid hormone, 11 benzodiazepine (1%); 203 (21%) BD were totally&#xD;
      abstinent, 650 (68%) drunk less than 10g, 101 between 10-50g/day and none drunk more. SA2&#xD;
      detected 29 (3%) HR profile including 9 Gilbert (0.9%), and 4 HR-FP with hemolysis profile&#xD;
      (0.4%). Among the 925 interpretable BD, the median FT was 0.08 (range 0.01-0.46), AT 0.06&#xD;
      (0.01-0.66). No subjects had severe fibrosis F3F4 or F2, and 909 (98.3%) had none or minimal&#xD;
      fibrosis (FT&lt;0.32). FT-AT were not associated with age, weight, BMI and treatments other than&#xD;
      OP: FT, lower in 125 women treated by OP (median 0.0490; 95% CI 0.044-0.058) than in non&#xD;
      treated (0.0659; 0.064-0.072; P=0.01). Mean age of BD was 36 yrs, 49% female, BMI 23.4 Kg/M2;&#xD;
      265 (28%) received treatment: 125 (13%) oestro-progestative (OP), 20 (2%) hypolipemiant, 16&#xD;
      (2%) anti-histaminic, 11 (1%) thyroid hormone, 11 benzodiazepine (1%); 203 (21%) BD were&#xD;
      totally abstinent, 650 (68%) drunk less than 10g, 101 between 10-50g/day and none drunk more.&#xD;
      SA2 detected 29 (3%) HR profile including 9 Gilbert (0.9%), and 4 HR-FP with hemolysis&#xD;
      profile (0.4%). Among the 925 interpretable BD, the median FT was 0.08 (range 0.01-0.46), AT&#xD;
      0.06 (0.01-0.66). No subjects had severe fibrosis F3F4 or F2, and 909 (98.3%) had none or&#xD;
      minimal fibrosis (FT&lt;0.32). FT-AT were not associated with age, weight, BMI and treatments&#xD;
      other than OP: FT, lower in 125 women treated by OP (median 0.0490; 95% CI 0.044-0.058) than&#xD;
      in non treated (0.0659; 0.064-0.072; P=0.01).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetics (DI) Mortality related to cirrhosis is increasing in patients with&#xD;
      insulino-resistance factors. Type 2 diabetic patients (DI) vs non-DI have higher risk of&#xD;
      non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and liver cancer death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      411 Consecutive DI seen in a diabetes unit, (HCV HBV neg), were prospectively included, as&#xD;
      well as a prospective control group of blood donors (BD). FT was performed blindly to any&#xD;
      clinical or biological data, according to analytic recommendations with security algorithms&#xD;
      permitting to exclude high-risk (HR) profiles of false negative (FN) and positive FT (FP).&#xD;
      Analysis used univariate comparison with BD matched for gender, age, alcohol consumption and&#xD;
      BMI, and multivariate logistic regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among DI 53% were male, mean age 55yrs, 66% DI type 2; 80% had fasting glucose ≥6.1mmol/L,&#xD;
      67% (257/382) had glycohemoglobin (glyHb) ≥7.5%, 43% (164/382) cholesterol ≥2.0 g/L, 29%&#xD;
      (111/382) triglycerides ≥1.5g/L, 50% had BMI ≥27, 48% had arterial hypertension, 72% had no&#xD;
      alcohol consumption, 26% a consumption ≤50g/d, and 2% &gt;50 g/d. BD were younger (36yr), had&#xD;
      lower BMI and alcohol consumption was similar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      F2F3F4 were identified by FT in 41/411 (10%) of DI, including 16 F2, 12 F3 and 13 F4, vs none&#xD;
      F2F3F4 among the 925 BD (P&lt;0.0001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among DI type 2, 11% had F2F3F4 vs 2% type 1 (p=0.01). DI was the only independent&#xD;
      significant factor associated with F2F3F4 in multivariate regression analysis (P&lt;0.0001).&#xD;
      After exclusion of 93 DI not matched because of higher age than BD, there were still 8.8%&#xD;
      (28/318) F2F3F4 in DI versus 0% in BD (P&lt;0.0001). Among the 41 DI F2F3F4, 22 had ALT&lt;50IU/L,&#xD;
      10 GGT &lt;50 IU/L, 10 both normal, 19 both elevated and 31 one. Only 2 DI had overt&#xD;
      clinical-biological signs of cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion: The prevalence of advanced fibrosis, estimated by FibroTest, is very high (10%)&#xD;
      in diabetics patients followed in a tertiary center. This study strongly suggests that&#xD;
      non-invasive biomarkers could be very useful for the screening of advanced fibrosis in type 2&#xD;
      diabetic patients to prevent liver mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with hyperlipemia (HL) A consecutive cohort of HL, (HCV,HBVneg), were prospectively&#xD;
      followed in a lipid center and the sera (stored at -80) were retrospectively analyzed; a&#xD;
      control group of blood donors (BD) was prospectively included. FT was performed blindly to&#xD;
      any clinical or biological data, and according to analytic recommendations including security&#xD;
      algorithms permitting to exclude extreme values and high-risk profiles of false negative and&#xD;
      positive (HR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 2,834 HL were included (51% female, median age 49 years); 83% had cholesterol&#xD;
      &gt;200mg/dl, 94% LDL-C &gt;100mg/dl, 21% HDL-C &gt;70mg/dl, 16% triglycerides &gt;200mg/dl. 36% BMI &gt;27,&#xD;
      32% insulin &gt;10mIU/ml, 39% arterial hypertension, 15% HOMA &gt;3.8 and 13.2% had fasting glucose&#xD;
      &gt;6mmol. GGT or ALT were &gt;50 IU/L in 458 HL (24%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      F2F3F4 were identified by FT in 53/1909 (2.8%) HL, including 31 F2, 14 F3, 3 F3-F4 and 4 F4&#xD;
      versus no (0%) among the 925 BD (P&lt;0.0001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the 53 F2F3F4 42 had ALT&lt;50IU/L, 27 GGT &lt;50 IU/L, 24 both normal, 8 both elevated and&#xD;
      29 at least one. Factors significantly (p&lt;0.01) associated with fibrosis in univariate&#xD;
      analysis were higher age, BMI, triglycerides, uricemia, insulinemia, and lower HDL&#xD;
      cholesterol. Drugs and alcohol consumption were not associated with fibrosis. In multivariate&#xD;
      logistic regression insulin [Odds ratio 43.7, CI (1.5; 61.0); P=0.001] was the most&#xD;
      significant risk factor. In patients with insulinemia &gt;10mIU/ml the prevalence of F2F3F4 was&#xD;
      9.7%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion: The prevalence of advanced fibrosis estimated by FibroTest, is high (2.8%) in HL&#xD;
      followed in a tertiary center. This study strongly suggests that non-invasive biomarkers&#xD;
      could be very useful for the screening of advanced fibrosis in high-risk groups such as&#xD;
      hyperlipemic patients to prevent liver mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strategy for the management of subjects identified as possible advanced fibrosis For each&#xD;
      subject with possible advanced fibrosis, information will be given by the physicians in&#xD;
      charge of the cohort. These subjects could have the routine assessment of advanced liver&#xD;
      fibrosis, including the elastometry (Fibroscan) available in the reference centre (Hepatology&#xD;
      Department of Groupe Hospitalier Pitié Salpêtrière) and the other independent signs of&#xD;
      cirrhosis (ultrasonography and endoscopy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calendar This project can be conducted in 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interdisciplinarity According to the wide population exposed to the risk of advanced&#xD;
      fibrosis, steatosis and steatohepatitis, this project is only possible if several medical&#xD;
      disciplines are involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As described in table 2 and 3, this project involves four different reference centers: Viral&#xD;
      Hepatitis Center (Thierry Poynard), Diabetes Center (Andre Grimaldi), Lipid Center (Eric&#xD;
      Bruckert), Alcoholic Center (Sylvie Naveau), two Prevention Centers (CPAM and CDAG), one&#xD;
      Anesthesiology department (Pierre Coriat) and one Transfusion Unit (Anne Mercadier).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Originality Our group has now the opportunity to demonstrate the feasibility of such&#xD;
      screening for the first time in the world. We can do that because of the new non invasive&#xD;
      biomarkers and the large number of subjects consulting in the different participating&#xD;
      centers. The prevalence of advanced fibrosis and asymptomatic cirrhosis, steatosis and&#xD;
      steatohepatitis will be established in France and similar studies could thereafter be applied&#xD;
      in other countries.&#xD;
