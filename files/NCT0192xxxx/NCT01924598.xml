  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anorexia Nervosa (AN) has the highest mortality of any psychiatric disorder and a paucity of&#xD;
      effective treatments. AN becomes intractable in around 20%, resulting in huge individual and&#xD;
      healthcare costs. Exploration of underlying processes and novel treatment strategies is thus&#xD;
      crucial. This is a pilot study of a novel translational approach to the investigation and&#xD;
      treatment of severe AN. The aims are (1) to explore the safety, acceptability and feasibility&#xD;
      of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) for AN (2) to map neural mechanisms underpinning aberrant&#xD;
      reward and optimise DBS targets. The study will involve 10 consenting adults with full mental&#xD;
      capacity, and the nain protocol will last 15 months. . There is then optional annual follow&#xD;
      ups for up to 5 years .It incorporates an ethical substudy including assessment of capacity&#xD;
      and informed consent. It combines complementary forms of cutting edge neuroimaging including&#xD;
      fMRI and MEG (magnetoencephalography). These will be complimentary in helping identify the&#xD;
      best strategy for treating severe AN using DBS. Individuals with severe intractable AN will&#xD;
      be eligible to take part. The study will be conducted in Oxford, United Kingdom at the John&#xD;
      Radcliffe and Warneford Hospitals. The individuals will have preoperative ethical,&#xD;
      neuroimaging and psychological assessments, A DBS operation in month 2, DBS switch on in&#xD;
      month 3 month postoperatively . DBS will be targeted to the Nucleus accumbens, followed by a&#xD;
      12 month post switch on follow-up period with monthly joint neurosurgical psychiatric and&#xD;
      psychological assessments and postoperative MEG scans . The study will further our&#xD;
      understanding of food reward processes in general and AN in particular indeed promises to&#xD;
      provide important information which may revolutionize future treatments. The proposal builds&#xD;
      upon a body of research investigating the role of aberrant reward processes in AN and&#xD;
      exploits our complementary research experience in AN using experimental behavioural&#xD;
      strategies, fMRI , MEG and DBS to establish a powerful translational research strategy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our hypothesis, based on prior research, is that DBS to the nucleus accumbens will have&#xD;
      beneficial neural and symptomatic effects in severe Anorexia Nervosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a test of this hypothesis, and to evaluate acceptability and ethical issues we aim to&#xD;
      initially study up to 10 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study may provide important clinical and scientific information to contribute to larger&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN SUMMARY The design will consist of a case series of 10 patients with repeated&#xD;
      measures. The individuals will be aged 20-65 with at least 7 years history of severe&#xD;
      treatment resistant AN, who are fully consenting and motivated to recover.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be selected on the basis of specific suitability criteria. A small case&#xD;
      series study design is needed as this is a novel and invasive strategy, and further&#xD;
      information about acceptability, feasibility and neural processes involved is required to&#xD;
      inform more extensive studies. This can optimally be obtained by initial detailed study of a&#xD;
      small number of patients. As some heterogeneity of response is likely, as advised by our&#xD;
      external reviewer Professor Walter Kaye, we are aiming to study 10 patients ..&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will be bilateral deep brain stimulation targeted at the nucleus accumbens&#xD;
      with stimulation at the ventral anterior limb of the internal capsule. Following DBS each&#xD;
      patient will be followed up every month weeks for 13 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, after recruitment there will be a 2 month preoperative period of thorough preoperative&#xD;
      examination of ethical issues including qualitative and semi structured interviews (MacCATCR&#xD;
      (MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool for Clinical Research))to assess competence and&#xD;
      informed consent will be completed by an independent researcher experienced in ethical issues&#xD;
      in AN (Jacinta Tan).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study participants will then be have the initial research assessment and will be reviewed&#xD;
      every month in joint eating disorders psychiatry -neurosurgery clinics . In month 10 there&#xD;
      will be two randomly assigned 2 week periods of active or sham stimulation,.&#xD;
&#xD;
      monthly assessments will include : • BMI • Semi structured interviews : Eating Disorder&#xD;
      Eating Disorder Examination (EDE)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Yale Brown CornellEating Disorder Scale (YBCEDS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Observer rated comorbidity (SCID / Hamilton Depression rating scale)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Computerized behavioural tasks: Food reward (Leeds-Oxford food preference task) habit&#xD;
           formation tasks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Self report schedules: EDE Questionnaire, functional impairment (CIA) , quality of life&#xD;
           scale (WHOQUALBREF); starvation dependence scale, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI, Beck&#xD;
           et al. 1961), the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (Spielberger, 1998), the Snaith-Hamilton&#xD;
           pleasure scale (SHAPS, Snaith et al. 1995) and the Ruminative Response Scale for Eating&#xD;
           Disorders (RRSED). Pre-operative imaging will involve fMRI and MEG. Post-operative&#xD;
           imaging will involve 3 MEG scans, two in month 10 and at study end, 15 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DETAILS OF METHODOLOGY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects selection and recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A list of eligible patients, fulfilling inclusion and exclusion criteria will be made in&#xD;
      discussion with Specialist Eating Disorder services clinicians. Patients will be ranked in&#xD;
      order of suitability according to specific suitability criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. Severity and intractiblity of Anorexia Nervosa ii. Restrictive anorexia nervosa - without&#xD;
      binging/purging iii. Absence of currently severe comorbid depression or self-harm iv. Ideally&#xD;
      on no, or minimal Psychotropic medication v. No recent history of compulsory treatment ( i.e.&#xD;
      in the last year) vi. Has tried existing treatment options without success vii. Has never had&#xD;
      periods of full remission viii. Intensity of desire to recover ix. Good intellectual function&#xD;
      and education - well able to comprehend the facts of the intervention (e.g. healthcare&#xD;
      background, university education) x. Poor social and occupational function, high levels of&#xD;
      distress - not functioning well, having poor quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The highest ranked patients will be asked if they consent to receiving information about the&#xD;
      project. If they are interested they will be approached by Dr Park with information about the&#xD;
      project, given an information sheet and the opportunity to discuss with family members. If&#xD;
      they remain interested they be will be offered the opportunity to meet with Dr Park and&#xD;
      Professor Aziz, for further information and to address questions , and involve their family&#xD;
      if they wish. Following this they will be reviewed by Dr Park a week later and thus given a&#xD;
      up to week to decide if they would like to participate. Consent to participate in the project&#xD;
      will be taken by Dr Park and can be freely withdrawn at any point with no effect on their&#xD;
      usual clinical care. Throughout the study the patients will receive supportive treatment as&#xD;
      usual from the clinical team who will be independent from the research team, and it will be&#xD;
      made clear they can opt out of the study at any point without having to give explanations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient consents to participation they will have preoperative assessments in the&#xD;
      University Research Department at the Warneford hospital:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I: PREOPERATIVE PHASE: 2 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Initial assessment with Research team. BMI: height and weight Semi structured interviews&#xD;
           of Eating Disorder and comorbidity: EDE, SCID, Yale-Brown-Obsessive Compulsive scale (&#xD;
           YBOCS); Self reported questionnaires as above indexing mood and quality of life&#xD;
           Computerised Behavioural tasks: Leeds -Oxford food preference task , Habit formation&#xD;
           task&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Weekly self report measures of symptoms done at home, weekly (5 minutes) using the' True&#xD;
           Colours' online self monitoring system pioneered at the University of Oxford Department&#xD;
           of Psychiatry, adapted for Eating disorders by Dr Park including the OXBREAD brief&#xD;
           rating scale. http://oxtext.psych.ox.ac.uk/true-colours. This self report system will&#xD;
           continue from entry to the study end. These self report schedules will be augmented by&#xD;
           brief weekly on - line face to face reviews by skype or face time with the aim of&#xD;
           offering participants maximal support and monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Neuropsychological assessment battery, duration approximately 1 hour:&#xD;
           (Neuropsychological assessments are routine for all DBS operations done in Oxford).&#xD;
&#xD;
           • WAIS IV subtests : Vocabulary , Matrix Reasoning , Digit Span , Coding (Wechsler&#xD;
           2008): Measures of general intellectual skills that is needed to make sense of&#xD;
           performance across other cognitive domains.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • BIRT Memory and Information Processing Battery : List Learning Task. Baseline measure&#xD;
           of Verbal Memory and Learning( Coughlan, Oddly, &amp; Crawford, , 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Verbal Fluency. Baseline measure of Phonemic and Semantic Fluency(Spreen ,&amp; Strauss&#xD;
           1998).&#xD;
&#xD;
           • CANTAB: IED and SWM subtests: Assess executive faculties such as set shifting and&#xD;
           spatial working memory (Robbins, James, Owen, Sahakian, McInnes&amp; Rabbitt, 1994)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Preoperative Capacity assessment Once each suitable patient is identified, and consented&#xD;
           , Dr Jacinta Tan will interview the patient independently to do a full MacCAT-CR&#xD;
           assessment plus in depth interview to explore the patient's experience of treatment,&#xD;
           rationale for participation and motivations for taking part in research from the&#xD;
           participants' perspective, to ensure a high level of capacity , voluntariness and&#xD;
           informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The assessment is expected to take 2.5 -3 hours and can be done in sections if the&#xD;
           patient tires. It will be tape recorded and transcribed. Jacinta will score the&#xD;
           MacCAT-CR and an independent observer will also score the MacCAT-CR. Both will also&#xD;
           provide global assessments of capacity to consent to research. Dr Tan will provide a&#xD;
           detailed report of the interview and her assessment of ethical acceptability of&#xD;
           participation for that individual. If she decides the patient is not suitable, the&#xD;
           process will be repeated with the next individual on the list who agrees.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Neuroimaging:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-operatively the patient will have:&#xD;
&#xD;
      a whole brain MRI scan including T1, T2, Inversion Recovery sequences and fMRI in resting&#xD;
      state and task based using our food reward task: These scans will occur at the John Radcliffe&#xD;
      Hospital , Oxford; total duration 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      a whole brain MEG scan- resting state and task based food reward task , which will be done at&#xD;
      the Warneford Hospital, Oxford, duration 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical optimisation: patients will have normalisation of electrolytes and ECG prior to being&#xD;
      considered fit for the operation. They will need to be a BMI of&gt; 13.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II OPERATIVE PHASE: Month 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DBS operation-will require up to 4 days of inpatient stay at the John Radcliffe Hospital&#xD;
      On the day of surgery, the patient will be anaesthetised and the base ring fixed to the skull&#xD;
      and a CT scan performed with a localiser fixed to the ring. The patient will then be&#xD;
      transferred to theatre and the scalp cleansed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By fusing the structural MRI scan to the stereotactic CT scan the trajectory to implant&#xD;
      electrodes into the nucleus accumbens bilaterally will be calculated. Then through bilateral&#xD;
      scalp incisions and a twist drill skull perforation, deep brain electrodes will be passed to&#xD;
      target bilaterally and fixed to the skull with titanium mini-plates. The scalp will then be&#xD;
      closed and a repeat stereotactic CT scan will be obtained to confirm electrode placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Having done so, back in theatre the electrodes will be connected to extension cables that&#xD;
      will then be passed sub-cutaneously down one side of the head, behind the ear to a&#xD;
      sub-cutaneous pouch below the collar bone and connected to a rechargeable pacemaker and all&#xD;
      the wounds closed. Video recordings are used as part of the assessment process during routine&#xD;
      implantation of DBS wires whether taking part in a study or not and is therefore considered&#xD;
      part of standard operating procedure. They will be assessed as part of the study to measure&#xD;
      the response to DBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The day after surgery, the pacemaker will be turned on to ascertain any immediate effects of&#xD;
      stimulation on symptoms and then switched off again. Having done so the patient will be&#xD;
      discharged two days after implant to be assessed six weeks after implant when all wounds are&#xD;
      healed and any acute effects of the DBS electrode insertion operation such as headaches,&#xD;
      scalp soreness or wound tenderness have worn off.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III: POST OPERATIVE FOLL0W-UP PHASE: Month 3 ( off): Month 4-15: DBS On&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first post -operative month the stimulator will remain off. At the end of Month 3:&#xD;
      post op MEG, followed by DBS switch on Month 4-6: 3 month dose optimisation period: dose&#xD;
      adjustment may require more frequent visits to Oxford, up to weekly, for neurosurgical review&#xD;
      Months 7-9: Dose stabilization period Month 10: Two fortnight periods of double blind either&#xD;
      DBS On or off. MEG scans in each condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Months 11-15: DBS at stable optimised dose. At month 15: Final MEG scan, neuropsychology&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post operative assessments, aiming to track the neural and symptomatic change as a result of&#xD;
      DBS will involve:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Continuation of weekly self report rating scale of eating disorder, anxiety and&#xD;
           depression involving the True Colours text messaging system started in phase I:&#xD;
           http://oxtext.psych.ox.ac.uk/true-colours (5 minutes)&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Monthly reviews (up to 2 hours) in the Warneford Research department incorporating:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Interview with Dr Park , research assistant and/or DPhil student: BMI: Semi structured&#xD;
      interviews including Eating Disorder Eating Disorders Examination (EDE), comorbid&#xD;
      psychopathology (SCID) Yale-Brown-Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS), . Behavioural&#xD;
      paradigms: food reward (Oxford-Leeds food preference task, habit task; Self report schedules&#xD;
      as in phase 1 assessing eating disorder symptoms, starvation dependence, functional&#xD;
      impairment and quality of life .&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Joint Neurosurgery-psychiatric reviews with Professor Aziz , and/ or Senior nurse&#xD;
      practitioner , and Dr Park: During this review neurosurgical parameters such as the degree of&#xD;
      stimulation, and psychiatric parameters such as experience of eating disorder and comorbid&#xD;
      psychiatric symptoms will be jointly assessed. Any necessary adjustments to stimulator&#xD;
      intensity will then be programmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post operative neuroimaging :&#xD;
&#xD;
      MEG resting state and food reward task based: (LO food preference task (OHBA, Warneford&#xD;
      Hospital) - 30 minutes; at month 3 ( pre DBS switch on , 2 scans in month , 10 in DBS ON and&#xD;
      OFF conditions , and end of study, month 15 Post operative Neuropsychological assessment 12&#xD;
      month after DBS on ie at 15 months. approximately 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optional post operative Ethics sub-study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A separate, post operative ethics sub study will be optional and participants will be&#xD;
           informed about this option in the main study patient information sheet, In the main&#xD;
           study consent form they will be asked if they agree to being contacted about the ethics&#xD;
           sub-study post operatively or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the end of the study it will thus be possible to produce a detailed report of the&#xD;
           ethics of the research, including the participant's perspective of the research&#xD;
           experience&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optional Annual follow up phase for up to 5 years postop: repeating interview and&#xD;
      questionnaires measures taken at entry and protocol end .&#xD;
