      The investigators are proposing a project that will examine the effectiveness of brief&#xD;
      motivational enhancement therapy in a population with concurrent psychotic disorders and&#xD;
      substance use disorders. This study will represent an emerging line of inquiry, as best&#xD;
      practice interventions with this concurrent disordered (CD) populations are yet to be&#xD;
      established.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Motivational enhancement therapy (MET) is grounded in research that explores the process of&#xD;
      change. The MET approach assists individuals to move through increasingly higher levels of&#xD;
      change towards action (making change) and maintaining change. The MET approach aims to invoke&#xD;
      rapid and internally motivated change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Two MET sessions adapted from Sampl and Kadden (2001) are prepared as two individual&#xD;
      sessions to reflect the original design of MET, allowing for client's to be met at their&#xD;
      respective stage of change. Further, individual sessions allow the treatment to be tailored&#xD;
      to client's individual reasons for change and personal coping strategies. The use of the&#xD;
      Personalized Feedback Report (PFR) further encourages treatment around client's personal&#xD;
      concerns and goals (Ramchand et al., 2011; See appendix 1 for further detail).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first treatment session, the therapist provides feedback from the initial CD&#xD;
      consultation, using the PFR to stimulate discussion about personal substance use and reasons&#xD;
      for change. Rapport building is also a key element to the first session, during which a&#xD;
      strong therapeutic alliance is initiated. The second session is aimed at strengthening the&#xD;
      commitment to change, exploring goal setting, and preparation for group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) Schizophrenia Division introduced a CD&#xD;
      service in 2009. Since the time of its inception, more than 200 consultations have been&#xD;
      conducted. Of those consultations, more than 80%recommended attending CD groups offered with&#xD;
      the Schizophrenia Program. However, less than 10% have followed those recommendations and&#xD;
      attended the CD group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on what is known about challenges surrounding engagement of CD clients in recommended&#xD;
      treatments coupled with guidelines for evidence-based treatment with this population&#xD;
      (Ledgerwood et al., 2008; Tsuang et al., 2006; Roncero et al., 2011), the purpose of the&#xD;
      current study is to explore the ability of MET to increase engagement in CD interventions for&#xD;
      clients diagnosed with psychotic and substance use disorders.&#xD;
