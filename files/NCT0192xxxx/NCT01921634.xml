      There is great variation seen in the incidence of appendiceal endometriosis. The variation is&#xD;
      most likely multifactorial, but method with which the specimen is examined may play a role.&#xD;
      If analysis using more cuts is used, appendiceal endometriosis may be diagnosed at a higher&#xD;
      rate.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endometriosis is the presence of endometrial and stromal glands at extrauterine sites. One of&#xD;
      the extrauterine sites that may be involved is the GI tract. The extent of bowel involvement&#xD;
      can range from an incidental spot on the serosa to ectopic endometrium causing a bowel&#xD;
      obstruction. The rate at which the bowel is involved ranges from 3-34%, as noted by Gustofson&#xD;
      in a literature review published in Fertility and Sterility. The symptomatology of GI&#xD;
      endometriosis can be vast. Presenting as cyclic or chronic pelvic pain, right lower quadrant&#xD;
      pain, melena, GI upset/pain, and as serious as intussusception and appendicitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence with which endometriosis is identified in the appendix potentially causing the&#xD;
      complications that were noted, is reported as a wide range, 1-22%. The low of 1% is reported&#xD;
      in two separate studies. The first, by Harper and Soules, published in the International&#xD;
      Journal of Gynecology and Obstetrics, and the second, by Weed and Ray, in Obstetrics and&#xD;
      Gynecology. The highest rate of 22% was reported by Berker and colleagues in the Journal of&#xD;
      Minimally Invasive Gynecology. Noting the possibility of greater than 20% of individuals with&#xD;
      endometriosis having appendiceal involvement, incidental appendectomy may be of benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) released a Committee Opinion on&#xD;
      incidental appendectomy that was reaffirmed in 2012. These are the guidelines that are&#xD;
      followed by gynecologists today. ACOG notes that women 35years of age and younger benefit the&#xD;
      most from elective coincidental appendectomy. Others who may be of significant benefit are&#xD;
      those patients with a complicated differential, those in who chemotherapy is anticipated, and&#xD;
      those who are expected to have extensive post-op adhesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACOG goes on to note that the decision to perform an appendectomy at the time of a&#xD;
      gynecologic procedure should be based on individual scenarios after the risks and benefits&#xD;
      are discussed with the patient. The procedure has a low risk of morbidity, and if there is&#xD;
      reasonable probability the benefits outweigh the risks, based on age or history, elective&#xD;
      coincidental appendectomy during primary gynecologic procedure may be appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the variation seen in publications, the rate of diagnosis that the surgeon may&#xD;
      find may be broad. The reason for this variation, though, is under speculation. Although, it&#xD;
      is most likely multifactorial, the method with which the specimen is analyzed may play a&#xD;
      role. In all of the methods sections in the above mentioned research papers and others&#xD;
      regarding this topic, description of the technique used for pathologic analysis was not&#xD;
      available. Here at Penn State Hershey Medical Center, a 3 slice method is employed. A cut is&#xD;
      made at the proximal and distal end, and a third cut in the center. If this method is&#xD;
      modified to include more cuts, the hypothesis is that endometriosis of the appendix will be&#xD;
      diagnosed at a higher rate. Appendix specimens will be collected as indicated, following ACOG&#xD;
      recommendations. After removal of the appendix patient's will be consented to allow the&#xD;
      second pathologic analysis. Time frame for collection and second analysis will be&#xD;
      approximately 12 months, the anticipated time to obtain 100 specimens.&#xD;
