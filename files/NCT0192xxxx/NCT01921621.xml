      This study examines in a prospective, randomized and blinded study design the impact of a&#xD;
      proficiency based training methodology on the acquisition of arthroscopic surgical skills&#xD;
      employing both a dry shoulder simulator model, and cadaver specimens for the demonstration of&#xD;
      surgical skill proficiency.&#xD;

      Background: Simulation-based skills training has been proposed as a method of augmenting&#xD;
      traditional in vivo training of surgeons.[1] Simulation based training is still in its&#xD;
      infancy and there is considerable variability in the United States and around the world on&#xD;
      how this type of training is configured.[2] The first successful simulation validation study&#xD;
      used a proficiency-based progression methodology.[3] Trainees were required to demonstrate a&#xD;
      performance benchmark (based on experienced surgeons performance on a simulator) before&#xD;
      completing a laparoscopic cholecystectomy in vivo.[4] This approach has not been used in&#xD;
      arthroscopy. In this study we propose to evaluate the utility of proficiency based skills&#xD;
      training for learning how to perform an arthroscopic Bankart repair for unidirectional&#xD;
      anterior shoulder instability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proficiency will be determined using metric based performance levels of surgeons very&#xD;
      experienced in performing an arthroscopic Bankart procedure.[5] Metrics have previously been&#xD;
      identified, operationally defined and agreed upon at an Arthroscopy Association of North&#xD;
      America Delphi panel meeting and then validated. Metrics which have demonstrated construct&#xD;
      validity will be used to define a performance benchmark/level of proficiency. Group C will be&#xD;
      required to train on a simulator model until they demonstrate this predetermined performance&#xD;
      level. At the completion of training all trainees are required to complete a Bankart&#xD;
      procedure on a fresh cadaver shoulder specimen. Operative performance will be video recorded&#xD;
      and subsequently assessed by two experienced arthroscopic surgeons blinded to subject&#xD;
      identity and group. Raters will have been trained to reliably identify predefined procedural&#xD;
      steps, errors and sentinel errors to an inter-rater reliability level of r &gt;0.8. [6]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: It is hypothesized that proficiency based progression trainees will perform an&#xD;
      arthroscopic Bankart procedure significantly better on a fresh cadaver shoulder than&#xD;
      traditionally trained subjects. They will also perform significantly better than trainees who&#xD;
      received the exact same curricular material,including the use of a simulator, but will be&#xD;
      allowed to progress at their own desired pace with no requirement to demonstrate performance&#xD;
      of skills to a proficiency benchmark before progressing in training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure: Three groups of orthopaedic surgical trainees in postgraduate years four and five&#xD;
      will be provided online access to orientation videos demonstrating how to perform a standard&#xD;
      arthroscopic Bankart repair. A set of baseline assessments of all 3 groups will be obtained&#xD;
      prior to the beginning of training and include visuospatial,[7] perceptual,[8,9] and&#xD;
      psychomotor evaluations[10-13] to ensure that the groups are comparable. The standard&#xD;
      training group (Group A) will then progress with the training as they would today during a&#xD;
      routine resident course. Groups B and C will be prospectively randomized (using an online&#xD;
      randomizer) to their respective training conditions. Group C will study the online didactic&#xD;
      information until they have demonstrated a predefined proficiency criterion. In addition,&#xD;
      successful completion and proficiency demonstration with arthroscopic knot tying will be a&#xD;
      requirement for them to proceed to the simulation based training models. The benchmark has&#xD;
      been established using knots tied by an experienced group of arthroscopic surgeons. On the&#xD;
      simulation models they will continue training until proficiency has been demonstrated. Group&#xD;
      C trainees will be supervised and given formative feedback on their performance by an&#xD;
      experienced trainer and assessor during these skills training sessions. Group B will complete&#xD;
      the same curriculum as Group C with the exception that they will be free to progress through&#xD;
      training at their own desired pace with no requirement to demonstrate proficiency in any&#xD;
      phase of the training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome assessment On completion of the course proper all three groups of trainees will be&#xD;
      required to complete a Bankart procedure on a fresh cadaver specimen. They will be assisted&#xD;
      by an experienced orthopaedic surgeon blinded to the subjects training group and instructed&#xD;
      to assist ONLY at the direction of the study participant. No guidance will be provided. Their&#xD;
      performance will be video recorded for subsequent analysis. Video raters will be experienced&#xD;
      orthopaedic surgeons who will be blinded as to subjects' identity and group. Objective&#xD;
      assessment of their intra-operative performance will be measured using the pre-defined&#xD;
      performance metrics agreed upon by the Arthroscopy Association of North America Delphi panel&#xD;
      and previously demonstrated to show construct validity. These will include correct steps of&#xD;
      the procedure completed, time to complete the procedure, intra-procedure errors and sentinel&#xD;
      errors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power Calculations Based on data derived from the construct validity study on the shoulder&#xD;
      model the following power calculation estimates were obtained for Steps completed correctly,&#xD;
      Time to perform the procedure, Errors and Sentinel Errors made. Calculations are based on a&#xD;
      group size of n = 16, and reference mean and standard deviation scores, an Alpha of 5% which&#xD;
      corresponds to a 95% Confidence Interval and a two-tailed statistical test for significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In previous studies a transfer effectiveness ration (TER) of 26 - 42% has been shown for&#xD;
      novices.[13] A TER of 20% means that the PBP trained group would complete 44.88 steps of the&#xD;
      procedure in comparison to the control groups 37.4. The statistical power of this difference&#xD;
      is 0.99. A similar magnitude of difference (i.e., 20%) for time and sentinel errors would&#xD;
      result in a mean difference with a statistical power &gt; 0.8. Error scores would require a&#xD;
      difference between the mean scores of the group ~ 40% to reach an acceptable level of&#xD;
      significance. Furthermore, all of these differences would mean that the PBP trainees were&#xD;
      still not outperforming the experts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following analyses will be conducted:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The primary analysis will compare the intra-operative performance of trainees. For each&#xD;
           subject, the number or intra-operative steps completed, time taken, errors and sentinel&#xD;
           errors will be compared across the three groups with one factor analysis of variance&#xD;
           (ANOVA) and specific contrasts between groups will be conducted with Scheffe F-tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Two-factor ANOVA for repeated measures where factor one is training method and factor&#xD;
           two is the anchor number will be conducted on the variables listed. The sphericity&#xD;
           assumption, relating to the conditional variances of all pair-wise differences will be&#xD;
           evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical comparisons for repeated measures for the placement of Anchors 1 - 3.&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Knot Tying Steps&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Knot Tying Errors&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Aptitude and Performance Pearson Product Moment Correlation Coefficient and Multiple&#xD;
      Regression Analysis will be used to assess the strength of the relationship between trainees'&#xD;
      performance on individual and combined baseline assessments and objectively assessed&#xD;
      performance on the Bankart procedure. The same type of analysis will be used to assess the&#xD;
      strength of the relationship between knowledge at the start of the course and Bankart&#xD;
      procedure performance.&#xD;
