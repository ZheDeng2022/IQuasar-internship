  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dupuytren disease (DD) is a progressive fibromatosis of the palmar fascias of the hand and&#xD;
      fingers, which may lead to extension deficits of the fingers. The disease can be very&#xD;
      disabling in moderate and severe cases, whereby performing normal daily activities can become&#xD;
      very problematic. The aetiology and pathogenesis are not completely understood. There is a&#xD;
      genetic disposition and it is influenced by environmental factors. The disease is especially&#xD;
      prevalent in white males of Northern European descent above 50 years of age. There is paucity&#xD;
      of knowledge about the natural progression of the disease. Several studies have been&#xD;
      conducted on progression of disease and from these studies it becomes obvious that the&#xD;
      disease is progressive over several years. However, in most studies only one moment of&#xD;
      follow-up has taken place, so the course of the progression over time is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to enhance our knowledge on the natural disease progression of DD at&#xD;
      different stages.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary objective: To study natural disease progress of Dupuytren Disease (DD) in&#xD;
           different stages of disease in males and females above 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. To study the effect of potential risk factors for DD on natural disease progress.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. To study at what stage of disease patients with DD experience problems in daily&#xD;
                life.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. To study the incidence and course of recurrent disease. Primary Hypothesis: The&#xD;
                natural course of disease is an exponential function of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. To study the intrarater reliability of the measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
           f. To determine whether the echogenicity of the nodules can predict progression g. To&#xD;
           determine whether extension deficit measurements can be replaced by measurements of&#xD;
           extension, and whether this will facilitate the statistical analysis h. To determine the&#xD;
           association between passive and active measurements of extension and extension deficit,&#xD;
           and to see whether active measurements can be derived from passive measurements and vice&#xD;
           versa.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study design: The study is designed as a prospective observational pilot study with a&#xD;
           follow-up of 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study population: Males and females above 18 years of age with all stages of primary&#xD;
           Dupuytren's disease in at least one hand&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Main study parameters/endpoints: The natural course of progression of DD measured as the&#xD;
           increase or decrease in size of nodules and cords in millimetres and/or increase of&#xD;
           total passive extension deficit in degrees, from baseline to endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary study parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Patient-reported hand function (Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire (MHOQ),&#xD;
                Patient-Rated Wrist/Hand Evaluation (PRWHE) and Unit√© Rhumatologique des Affections&#xD;
                de la Main (URAM) scale&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. incidence and course of recurrent disease&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. disease activity (ultrasonography and tonometry)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Procedure Patients visit the outpatient clinic every 6 months (first 5 years of&#xD;
           follow-up) and later on every 12 months (last 5 years of follow-up) for an anamnestic&#xD;
           interview, physical examination of the hands, ultrasonography, tonometry and for filling&#xD;
           out the PROMs.&#xD;
