    <textblock>
      In women with regular menstrual cycles, antral follicles have been shown to grow in&#xD;
      synchronous cohorts, called waves, 2-3 times in a menstrual cycle. It is unknown whether&#xD;
      these waves of follicle growth also occur in women with amenorrhea or if there is&#xD;
      abnormal/absent follicle growth. Further, oligo- or amenorrhea has been associated with&#xD;
      metabolic disturbances, such as over- or under-nutrition, central obesity and insulin&#xD;
      resistance. Yet, mechanisms whereby metabolic factors influence folliculogenesis in women are&#xD;
      poorly understood. To understand potential mechanisms, the investigators plan to characterize&#xD;
      follicle growth dynamics in women with or without regular menstrual cycles and identifying&#xD;
      key metabolic differences in these women which may be important in normal follicle&#xD;
      development and fertility.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In the ovaries, eggs rest in fluid filled sacs called follicles. When follicles grow they&#xD;
      form small fluid-filled cysts that can be easily seen when we use ultrasound to view the&#xD;
      ovaries. In women with regular menstrual cycles, groups of 10 to 20 follicles grow and&#xD;
      regress at 2 or 3 different times during their cycle (usually over a 28- day period). Several&#xD;
      of these follicles grow to a stage where they begin to develop the potential to ovulate - but&#xD;
      in general only one follicle is chosen to ovulate. Thus, at any given time during the&#xD;
      menstrual cycle, numerous fluid-filled follicles can be visualized in a woman's ovaries at&#xD;
      various stages of development using transvaginal ultrasonography. In women with absent or&#xD;
      infrequent menstrual cycles, very little is known about the growth patterns of their&#xD;
      follicles and how factors such as metabolic hormones, might play a role in the failure to&#xD;
      ovulate. Being underweight or overweight increases your chances of having irregular or absent&#xD;
      menstrual cycles and that a history of abnormal reproductive function compounds a woman's&#xD;
      risk for chronic diseases such as infertility, diabetes, hypertension, atherosclerosis and&#xD;
      certain cancers. This is particularly the case for women with polycystic ovary syndrome&#xD;
      (PCOS) that have menstrual cycles that appear to worsen or improve depending on their body&#xD;
      weight and metabolic status. PCOS is an endocrine disorder that affects 6-12% of&#xD;
      reproductive-aged women within the general population. The hallmark features of PCOS are&#xD;
      menstrual irregularity, increased levels of androgens, and polycystic ovaries. The current&#xD;
      diagnostic criteria require 2 out of 3 of these features to be present for the diagnosis,&#xD;
      therefore a number of phenotypes of PCOS exist. However, the metabolic and reproductive&#xD;
      differences across the phenotypic spectrum of PCOS are not well understood. Women with PCOS&#xD;
      characteristically have polycystic ovaries, where up to 10 times more follicles are present&#xD;
      in the ovary at any given time. Further, the follicle-size populations and overall&#xD;
      distribution throughout the ovary varies in women - follicles may be situated around the&#xD;
      periphery of the ovary or may be distributed throughout the ovary. Presumably these small&#xD;
      follicles are arrested in development - but emerging data from the Lujan laboratory suggest&#xD;
      that this is not the case. It is assumed that ovulation does not occur and that follicles do&#xD;
      not grow in a normal wave pattern. In truth, no study has ever looked to see whether&#xD;
      follicles are actually growing, regressing or are arrested in women with irregular/absent&#xD;
      menstrual cycles. By comparing follicle wave dynamics, reproductive hormones and markers of&#xD;
      metabolism in women with regular and irregular menstrual cycles, the researchers plan to&#xD;
      identify what factors might explain why fertility potential and long-term health are&#xD;
      compromised in some women but not in others. Further, we will determine if any of these&#xD;
      metabolic factors are unique to PCOS representing specific metabolic risks or follicle growth&#xD;
      impairment. The ultimate goal of this research is to understand how body composition,&#xD;
      nutrition and metabolism regulate follicle development in women so we can better develop&#xD;
      lifestyle and drug therapies to help women preserve their fertility and long-term health.&#xD;
      Since obesity has recently become the leading cause of infertility in North America, these&#xD;
      studies are especially important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To accomplish our objective, the investigators plan to recruit up to 40 women with regular&#xD;
      menstrual cycles and up to 40 women with irregular/absent menstrual cycles. Our goal is to&#xD;
      recruit an equal number of women in each group such that they are matched for age (18 - 35&#xD;
      years old) and body mass index (BMI; Normal weight = 18 - 24 kg/m2; Overweight = 25 - 29&#xD;
      kg/m2; Obese = 30kg/m2). Women will undergo serial ultrasonographic of their ovaries every&#xD;
      other day from ovulation to ovulation in women with regular menstrual cycles or for 5 weeks&#xD;
      in women with cycle irregularity. Blood samples will be collected at each visit. Ultrasound&#xD;
      scans of the ovaries will be assessed for the total number, size, and distribution of&#xD;
      follicles using ultrasound imaging techniques. Blood samples collected will be assayed to&#xD;
      determine serum concentrations of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone&#xD;
      (FSH), estradiol, progesterone, anti-müllerian hormone (AMH), and inhibin B. During day 3-5&#xD;
      in women with regular menstrual cycles or at a time where no dominant follicle or corpus&#xD;
      luteum is present, an early morning visit will be conducted to assess the following metabolic&#xD;
      parameters : (1) 75-gram oral glucose tolerance test to characterize glucose and insulin&#xD;
      dynamics at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes post-glucose ingestion; (2) dual X-ray&#xD;
      absorptiometry (DXA) scan to quantify body fat and lean muscle distribution; (3) vitals and&#xD;
      anthropometry assessment to measure waist and hip circumference, height, weight, blood&#xD;
      pressure, and heart rate, and (4) fasting blood tests to detect serum concentrations of&#xD;
      androgens (i.e., total testosterone, androstenedione, free androgen index) and serum markers&#xD;
      of metabolic syndrome (i.e., lipids and hemoglobin A1C); (5) optional subcutaneous fat biopsy&#xD;
      to analyze fat cells, which represent a site of reproductive hormone synthesis.&#xD;
