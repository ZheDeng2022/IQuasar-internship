                  test at the Screening Visit (Visit 1) and a negative urine pregnancy test at the&#xD;
                  Baseline Visit (Visit 3). Females of child-bearing potential must agree to&#xD;
                  abstain from sexual activity that could result in pregnancy or agree to use&#xD;
                  acceptable methods of contraception.&#xD;

             hemosiderosis) requiring chronic treatment with an iron chelator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum ferritin &gt;500µg/L at the Screening Visit (Visit 1).&#xD;

               2. Have been enrolled in a clinical study (including vaccine studies) that, in the&#xD;
                  investigator's opinion, may impact this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of malignancy within the past 5 years, with the exception of basal cell or&#xD;
             squamous cell skin carcinoma or cervical carcinoma in situ or completely resected&#xD;
             colon carcinoma in situ.&#xD;
&#xD;
