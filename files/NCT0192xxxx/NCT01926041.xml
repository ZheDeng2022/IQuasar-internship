  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Existing literature investigating the impact of smoking cessation on new-onset diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus (DM) risk is conflicting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combing the need for smoking cessation and body weight self-management to prevent the&#xD;
      progression of prediabetes stage into DM, with the public implementation of the&#xD;
      second-generation cessation program, we aimed to study the effectiveness of the Fight Tobacco&#xD;
      and Stay Fit (FIT2) program aiming at promoting smoking cessation and restricting&#xD;
      post-cessation weight gain together in prediabetic smokers regarding long-term glycemic and&#xD;
      DM-related health outcomes.&#xD;

      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect to recruit study participants at National Taiwan University Hospital and its Yunlin&#xD;
      branch, where a systematic identification system has been applied to classify the tobacco&#xD;
      addiction status of every patient in outpatient clinics. This study invites identified&#xD;
      current smokers to undergo screening tests between August 2013 to January 2017. All&#xD;
      participants should give informed consent, with personal data protected. Only individuals&#xD;
      aged 30 to 75 years are included. A history of diabetes, hypertension, FTND, alcohol&#xD;
      consumption, physical activity, depression, sleep quality, and current medications is&#xD;
      collected through standardized personal interviews. Prediabetic participants are those&#xD;
      repeatedly having either of the following: 1) plasma glucose 100 to 125 mg/dL (5.6 to 6.9&#xD;
      mmol/L) in the fasting state; 2) plasma glucose 140 to 199 mg/dL (7.8 to 11.0 mmol/L) two&#xD;
      hours after a 75-g oral glucose load; 3) glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) 5.7% to 6.4%, in the&#xD;
      absence of diabetic medications. Prediabetic participants who smoke â‰¥10 CPD for at least 6&#xD;
      months are classified as prediabetic smokers. Excluded are those with existing diagnosis of&#xD;
      DM, thyroid diseases, acute cardiac conditions within 3 months, acute renal failure, chronic&#xD;
      glomerulonephritis, polycystic kidney disease, mental health disorders ever diagnosed by&#xD;
      psychiatrists, pregnancy, breast-feeding, malignancy; or current use of diabetic medications,&#xD;
      smoking cessation medications, steroids, lithium or antipsychotics. Information about tobacco&#xD;
      use, alcohol consumption, physical activity, depression, sleep quality, personal medical&#xD;
      histories, and current medications is collected through standardized personal interviews and&#xD;
      medical records. The study protocol was approved by the National Taiwan University Hospital&#xD;
      Research Ethics Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size estimation We estimate to recruit at least 596 prediabetic smokers, 33% (199) of&#xD;
      whom decide to join the intervention, to reach 90% power and a two-sided 95% CI for the&#xD;
      detection of a 50% risk reduction, assuming 30% as the risk of incident T2D during follow-up&#xD;
      in the usual care group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assignment, prospective follow-up, and analytic design The assignment of this trial is based&#xD;
      on shared decision-making. At baseline, all eligible prediabetic smokers are asked if they&#xD;
      would like to join the Fight Tobacco and Stay Fit (FIT2) program or just receive usual care.&#xD;
      Beginning at enrollment, the smoking status, breath carbon monoxide levels, anthropometric&#xD;
      indices, and blood tests were recorded every six months. The intention-to-treat analysis will&#xD;
      be performed among all participants joining the FIT2 program and receiving usual care. The&#xD;
      time-varying analysis will be adopted among participants with documented smoking status at&#xD;
      six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FIT2 program and post-program abstinence:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FIT2 program is a 16-week smoking cessation program that combined varenicline&#xD;
      prescription with individualized counseling on not only smoking cessation but also weight&#xD;
      control techniques. Participants in this group can receive their medications up to 16 weeks&#xD;
      within one year. Each participant also received counseling for individualized techniques for&#xD;
      smoking cessation and body weight control at each visit. We do not prescribe nicotine&#xD;
      replacement therapy (NRT) because it may induce insulin resistance and confound our study&#xD;
      outcome. Bupropion is not available for smoking cessation in our institutions. Varenicline&#xD;
      users are encouraged either to set their quit day 8 days after starting the medication; or to&#xD;
      freely choose quit day at any time between Days 8 and 35 after starting treatment (i.e.,&#xD;
      following drug titration that took place within the first week). Varenicline users are also&#xD;
      forbidden to use NRT during the study period. The varenicline prescription adheres to&#xD;
      regulations by the Health Promotion Administration, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taiwan&#xD;
      (www.hpa.gov.tw) and manufacturer's directions, usually initiated at 0.5 mg once daily for&#xD;
      the first three days then increased to 1 mg once daily. From day 8 to up to 16 weeks, the&#xD;
      recommended dose is 1 mg varenicline twice daily. During the therapy course, physicians are&#xD;
      allowed to adjust varenicline dosage according to tolerability. Drug adverse events,&#xD;
      withdrawal symptoms, and perceived barriers to quitting should be recorded and addressed.&#xD;
      Physicians should emphasize that if there are any uncontrolled depressed moods, suicidal&#xD;
      thoughts, or attempts, they are to cease varenicline treatment and consult a psychiatrist&#xD;
      immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Smoking status is assessed by self-reported 7-day point-prevalence abstinence, confirmed by a&#xD;
      breath CO level. Cotinine is not used to assess abstinence because, when used with&#xD;
      self-report to indicate whether a person has smoked, CO and cotinine levels show high&#xD;
      agreement. We provide participants in the intervention group with individualized counseling&#xD;
      to help minimize the relapse rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to varenicline prescription and smoking cessation counseling covered in&#xD;
      conventional smoking cessation services, the FIT2 program also offers individualized weekly&#xD;
      behavior coaching in diet and physical activity to restrict PCWG. The FIT2 participants are&#xD;
      encouraged to do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity (3.0-6.0 metabolic equivalents)&#xD;
      aerobic physical activity throughout the week. The counseling sessions allow opportunities to&#xD;
      identify obstacles to lifestyle change and to discuss approaches with a professional panel of&#xD;
      dietitians and certified personal trainers. The FIT2 participants are encouraged to do at&#xD;
      least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity (3.0-6.0 metabolic equivalents) aerobic physical&#xD;
      activity throughout the week. Emphasis is placed on checking the weekly diary for body&#xD;
      weight, food, and physical activity through protected cellphone messages between participants&#xD;
      and the assigned panel professionals. For those who gain weight, more intensive ways of&#xD;
      calorie restriction and physical activity (at least 300 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic&#xD;
      physical activity per week) are instructed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-program smoking status is recorded weekly from 16 weeks to six months by self-reported&#xD;
      7-day point prevalence of abstinence and a breath carbon monoxide level of &lt;6 ppm.&#xD;
      Post-program quitters are those who quit successfully at 16 weeks just after the FIT2 program&#xD;
      and keep maintaining their non-smoking status at six months (post-program abstinence). For&#xD;
      the time-varying analysis, participants who fail to stop smoking after the intervention are&#xD;
      reassigned to the control group. Those who relapse after six months are still classified as&#xD;
      post-program quitters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usual care and control:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usual care is provided for prediabetic smokers who decide not to receive the FIT2 program.&#xD;
      Usual care comprises encouragement to quit smoking and initiate a therapeutic lifestyle&#xD;
      change at each visit. In the time-varying analysis, the control group contains participants&#xD;
      from the intervention group who fail to achieve post-program abstinence and all participants&#xD;
      receiving usual care, including those who quit smoking on their own. Given that the&#xD;
      post-program abstinence is established at six months after enrollment, for the time-varying&#xD;
      analysis, the follow-up time experienced by the controls also includes the first six months&#xD;
      experienced by all post-program quitters to reduce immortal time bias.&#xD;
