    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immune response to two different HIV&#xD;
      vaccine regimens in healthy, HIV-uninfected people in the United States and South Africa.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immune response to two different&#xD;
      vaccine schedules of a prime with either DNA HIV vaccine (DNA-HIV-PT123), or NYVAC HIV&#xD;
      vaccine (NYVAC-HIV-PT1 and NYVAC-HIV-PT4) followed by a boost combination of NYVAC HIV&#xD;
      vaccine (PT1 &amp; PT4) and AIDSVAX B/E. Study researchers will also evaluate whether body mass&#xD;
      index (BMI) and/or sex impact the immunogenicity of the vaccine regimens in participants from&#xD;
      South Africa, and look at regional differences in immunologic responses between United States&#xD;
      and South African participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll 264 healthy, HIV-uninfected people, ages 18-50, in the United States&#xD;
      and South Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three groups and receive either one of the&#xD;
      vaccine regimens or placebo. Participants will receive injections according to their assigned&#xD;
      group schedule at study entry (Month 0) and Months 1, 3, and 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will remain in the clinic for 30 minutes after receiving the vaccines for&#xD;
      observation and monitoring. For 7 days after receiving the vaccines, participants will record&#xD;
      their symptoms and report them to study researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visits will occur at study entry, and Months 1, 1.5, 3, 3.5, 6, 6.5, 9, and 12. All&#xD;
      study visits will include a physical examination, HIV risk reduction counseling, and&#xD;
      interviews and/or questionnaires. Select study visits will include urine collection, an&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (ECG), blood collection, a pregnancy test for female participants, and HIV&#xD;
      testing. At some visits, some participants may also provide samples of cervical fluid, rectal&#xD;
      fluid, and/or semen. Study researchers will contact participants by telephone or e-mail once&#xD;
      a year for 3 years following the first vaccination for follow-up health monitoring.&#xD;
