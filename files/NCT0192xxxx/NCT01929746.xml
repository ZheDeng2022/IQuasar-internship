      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of BIIB019&#xD;
      (Daclizumab High Yield Process; DAC HYP) administered as a single subcutaneous (SC) dose (75&#xD;
      mg or 150 mg) Japanese and Caucasian adult healthy volunteers. The secondary objective of&#xD;
      this study in this study population is to assess the safety and tolerability of BIIB019&#xD;
      administered as a single SC dose (75 mg or 150 mg).&#xD;
