      This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of adavosertib when given&#xD;
      together with local radiation therapy in treating children with newly diagnosed diffuse&#xD;
      intrinsic pontine gliomas. Adavosertib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of&#xD;
      the enzymes needed for cell growth. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays, gamma rays,&#xD;
      neutrons, protons, or other sources to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving adavosertib&#xD;
      with local radiation therapy may work better than local radiation therapy alone in treating&#xD;
      diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dose and schedule of&#xD;
      the adavosertib (Wee1 inhibitor AZD1775 [MK-1775]) administered concurrently with radiation&#xD;
      therapy in children with newly diagnosed diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To define and describe the toxicities of AZD1775 (MK-1775) given concurrently with&#xD;
      radiation therapy in children with newly diagnosed DIPG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of AZD1775 (MK-1775) in children with newly&#xD;
      diagnosed DIPG when given concurrently with radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To preliminarily define the antitumor activity of AZD1775 (MK-1775) within the confines of&#xD;
      a phase 1 study, including response rate, progression free survival, and overall survival of&#xD;
      treated patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the biologic activity of AZD1775 (MK-1775) by measuring expression of&#xD;
      phosphorylated-cell division cycle 2 G1 to S and G2 to M (p-CDC2) (cyclin-dependent kinase 1&#xD;
      [CDK1]) and phosphorylated-histone H3 (p-HH3) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)&#xD;
      before and after administration of AZD1775 (MK-1775) in children with newly diagnosed DIPG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess the biologic activity of AZD1775 (MK-1775) by measuring expression of&#xD;
      gamma-H2A histone family, member X (H2AX) in PBMCs, a marker of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)&#xD;
      double-strand breaks (dsDNA), before and after administration of AZD1775 (MK-1775) in&#xD;
      children with newly diagnosed DIPG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of adavosertib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo radiation therapy 5 days a week for 6 weeks (up to 30 fractions). Patients&#xD;
      also receive adavosertib orally (PO) on days 1-5 of weeks 1, 3, and 5; days 1-5 of weeks 1,&#xD;
      3, and 5 AND days 1, 3, and 5 of weeks 2, 4, and 6; OR days 1-5 of weeks 1-6 depending on&#xD;
      dose level assignment. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 2 months for&#xD;
      6 months, and then every 3 months thereafter.&#xD;
