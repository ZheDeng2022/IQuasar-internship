      The purpose of this study is to verify that the implementation of a protocol physiotherapy&#xD;
      musculoskeletal pain and reduces anxiety and improves quality of life in patients&#xD;
      hospitalized at the clinic of high-risk pregnancies at the Hospital das Clinicas of Ribeirao&#xD;
      Preto, with a diagnosis of preeclampsia and chronic hypertension with superimposed&#xD;
      preeclampsia. Where patients will be recruited, answered questionnaires before and after&#xD;
      application of physiotherapy protocol.&#xD;

      The hypertensive disorders in pregnancy affect approximately 5-8% of pregnant women&#xD;
      worldwide, contributing significantly to serious maternal and fetal complications. There are&#xD;
      various forms of hypertensive disorders that occur during pregnancy and among them are&#xD;
      pre-eclampsia and chronic hypertension with superimposed preeclampsia. These two disorders&#xD;
      present with high blood pressure and proteinuria, which leads often to hospitalization of&#xD;
      these women. It is believed that with such an accent hospitalization occur in pain conditions&#xD;
      that often affect pregnant women. Given these complications, this study aims to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of a physical therapy protocol used in pregnant women with preeclampsia&#xD;
      admitted with respect to blood pressure levels, responses maternal-fetal and perinatal, and&#xD;
      measure an expected improvement in quality of life in the reduction of reported pain and&#xD;
      anxiety. The study will include the participation of women with preeclampsia and chronic&#xD;
      hypertension with superimposed pre-eclampsia, hospitalized, with no significant complications&#xD;
      that may hinder the normal progress of pregnancy. Pregnant women will answer questionnaires&#xD;
      about quality of life, anxiety and scales to identify musculoskeletal discomfort. Monitoring&#xD;
      will be done both the pregnant woman and the fetus through imaging and laboratory, in&#xD;
      addition, pregnant women carry the exercise protocol previously proposed work. This is&#xD;
      expected to achieve satisfactory results in the improvement of maternal and fetal&#xD;
      hemodynamics in aspects of muscle discomfort and quality of life in a secure way for these&#xD;
      women.&#xD;
