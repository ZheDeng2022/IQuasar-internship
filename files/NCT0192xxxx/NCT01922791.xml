  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized double-blind placebo controlled intervention study with pregnant obese women&#xD;
      (n=440) will be conducted. The intervention will involve consumption of fish oil and/or&#xD;
      probiotic capsules from early pregnancy until 6 months after delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is firstly to investigate the effects of the supplements on the risk of&#xD;
      gestational diabetes mellitus and obesity in the women and secondly to modify the risk&#xD;
      markers of allergy and obesity in children of the women. Also the underlying metabolic&#xD;
      mechanisms will be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up visits at child's age of 5 to 6 years will be conducted to evalute long-term&#xD;
      effects on maternal and child health. The aim is to investigate the impact of dietary&#xD;
      intervention, diet, maternal overweight/obesity and gestational diabetes status as well as&#xD;
      gut microbiota and metabolism during pregnancy on maternal and child's health, allergy and&#xD;
      child neuropsychological development.&#xD;
