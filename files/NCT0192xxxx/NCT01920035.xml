    <textblock>
      Localized cooling/hypothermia using the UroCool System during robotic-assisted radical&#xD;
      prostatectomy (RARP) surgery results in an improved overall return to continence, (defined as&#xD;
      not wearing any protective urinary pads), compared with standard of care in men presenting&#xD;
      for RARP.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the use of an endorectal cooling device, UroCool, to achieve&#xD;
      controlled, local hypothermia of the pelvis. The study will evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness of the device in inducing hypothermia of the neuromuscular tissues impacting&#xD;
      continence during RARP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The UroCool system is designed to apply targeted temperature control to the pelvic anatomy&#xD;
      during RARP. The pelvis is cooled transrectally via a closed cycle recirculation of chilled&#xD;
      sterile saline using a single-use disposable balloon catheter connected via a circulation IV&#xD;
      set to a control console that is covered by a current 510(k) and commercially available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The UroCool polymeric catheter is designed to be inserted within the rectal cavity adjacent&#xD;
      to the prostate prior to surgery and removed upon completion of surgery. It is used in&#xD;
      conjunction with the InnerCool Console which circulates cold saline in a closed loop within&#xD;
      the UroCool catheter to allow for therapeutic localized cooling of the prostate gland and&#xD;
      surrounding areas during prostate surgery.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Improved return of overall continence.</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days post RARP</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective of the study is an improved return of overall continence measured at 90 days post RARP surgery. A favorable outcome would be improved overall continence in the RARP with hypothermia group versus the RARP without hypothermia group.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Faster return to continence.</measure>
    <time_frame>30, 60 and 90 days</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary objective of the study is to see if men will achieve a return to continence faster if treated with hypothermia. This will be assessed at 30, 60 and 90 days. A favorable outcome would be a reduced time to continence in the RARP with hypothermia group versus the RARP without hypothermia group.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Reduction of overall severe incontinence</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days, 6 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The third objective is to assess reduction of overall severe incontinence. Severe incontinence is defined as the need for 3 or more pads in a 24 hour period. This will be assessed at 90 days, 6 and 12 months. A favorable outcome would be a reduction of overall severe incontinence in the RARP with hypothermia group versus the RARP without hypothermia group.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is male and a candidate for robotic assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) for&#xD;
             the treatment of prostate cancer&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subject understands study procedures, risks of such procedures and is willing to&#xD;
             comply with all study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is willing and able to comply with all post-surgical milestones including&#xD;

             consent per the enrolling site's institutional procedure&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Presents with baseline or has a history of urinary incontinence&#xD;

             examining physician&#xD;
&#xD;

             resection, or proctocolectomy continent stool pouch, or any other extensive&#xD;

             deemed by the surgeon&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of prior treatment of any kind for prostate cancer; e.g. radiation therapy,&#xD;
             cryotherapy, high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), hormonal or chemotherapy&#xD;

             months. Any other acute or chronic condition which the Investigator believes will&#xD;
             unacceptably increase the risk of study participation or interfere with study&#xD;
             procedures and assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active or recent (within 1 month prior to study enrollment) participation in another&#xD;
