  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, there are several antiviral treatments effective for suppression of viral&#xD;
      replication but still failed to cure HBV infection in patients with chronic hepatitis B&#xD;
      (CHB). Seven drugs have been worldwide approved for the treatment of CHB at present:&#xD;
      conventional IFN (IFN) alfa, lamivudine (LAM), adefovir dipivoxil (ADV), pegylated IFN&#xD;
      (Peg-IFN) alfa, entecavir (ETV), telbivudine (LdT) and tenofovir (TDF). Conventional or&#xD;
      Peg-IFN alfa monotherapy has a narrow range of efficacy, is associated with several adverse&#xD;
      effects and is inconvenient because of frequent injections. Oral nucleot(s)ide analogues (NA)&#xD;
      are better tolerated; but virologic response to NA is frequently not durable and prolonged&#xD;
      treatment is associated with the emergence of drug-resistant HBV mutants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the best treatment choice for CHB is not clarified yet, certain therapeutic concepts&#xD;
      could be derived from the experience of treating patients with chronic hepatitis C or human&#xD;
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. A major advancement in treating hepatitis C or HIV&#xD;
      infection has been the development of combination therapy. Combination therapy has ever been&#xD;
      investigated in patients with CHB, but again the optimal strategy remains to be identified.&#xD;
      Entecavir, a carbocyclic deoxyguanosine NA, is one of the most potent anti-HBV agents ever&#xD;
      discovered. In addition, the 6-year drug resistance rate is 1.2% in selected lamivudine-naïve&#xD;
      cohorts. Pegylated interferon alfa-2a possesses both antiviral and immunomodulatory effects.&#xD;
      Overall, satisfactory virologic and serologic responses could be achieved using pegylated IFN&#xD;
      alfa in around 30-44% of these patients. Whether the combination therapy using Peg-IFN&#xD;
      alfa-2a plus ETV can achieve a long-term beneficial effect against ETV or Peg-IFN alfa-2a&#xD;
      alone is not clarified. A prior single-arm pilot study suggested that similar combination&#xD;
      therapy may be beneficial in patients with CHB. In this proposal, the investigators thus&#xD;
      hypothesize that the efficacy by using combination therapy with Peg-IFN alfa-2a plus&#xD;
      prolonged ETV is superior to that by using ETV or Peg-IFN alfa-2a alone in that Peg-IFN may&#xD;
      restore host immunity against HBV and prolonged ETV can maximize viral suppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this clinical trial is to evaluate the efficacy of the combination of&#xD;
      Peg-IFN alfa-2a at a dose of 180 mcg administered subcutaneously per week and ETV 0.5 mg&#xD;
      daily for 48 weeks followed by ETV 0.5 mg daily monotherapy for an additional 96 weeks versus&#xD;
      ETV 0.5 mg daily monotherapy for 144 weeks or Peg-IFN alfa-2a 180 mcg per week for 48 weeks&#xD;
      in patients with HBeAg-negative CHB. It will be an open-label, randomized, comparative,&#xD;
      multi-center clinical trial. The recruited patients will be equally randomized into three&#xD;
      treatment groups. Treatment-free follow-up period will be 48 weeks in both groups of&#xD;
      patients. The primary parameter is the &quot;Simultaneous achievement of HBsAg titer below 100&#xD;
      IU/ml and HBV DNA below 300 IU/ml at 144 weeks after start of treatment&quot;, by an&#xD;
      intention-to-treat analysis. Genotypic and virologic resistance to ETV will also be assessed&#xD;
      at baseline and at end of years 1, 2 and 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators anticipate that the rate of HBsAg &lt;100 IU/mL plus HBV DNA &lt;300 IU/mL at 3&#xD;
      years of the study period will be 30% for patients receiving Peg-IFN therapy and increased to&#xD;
      be 45% for patients receiving Peg-IFN plus entecavir therapy. With a 5% nominal significance&#xD;
      level (two-sided), 163 patients per group under a 1:1:1 ratio will provide 80% power to&#xD;
      detect a difference of 15% in treatment response rates between group I and III. Because this&#xD;
      will be a 4-year study for each patient, the investigators thus anticipate that the dropout&#xD;
      rate may be as high as 10%. Accordingly, a total of 540 (180x3) patients will be recruited,&#xD;
      in order to account for a dropout rate of up to10%.&#xD;
