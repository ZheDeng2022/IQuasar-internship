    <textblock>
      Replacing a G tube and placing feeding tubes is standard in the Emergency Department (ED) and&#xD;
      ICU, respectively. However placement requires a chest or abdominal x-ray to confirm correct&#xD;
      position. The investigators are testing the accuracy of the FDA approved devices RightSpot pH&#xD;
      Indicator &amp; RightLevel pH Detector in determining correct position based upon pH which will&#xD;
      then be correlated with the standard of care x-ray.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Feeding tube placement is a common procedure that occurs in most ICU healthcare settings. In&#xD;
      addition, replacement of G-tubes is a common practice in most ED settings throughout the US.&#xD;
      Various practices have been used to confirm its placement, including the usage of litmus&#xD;
      paper (acid versus base only), pH level indicators (precise measurement), auscultation,&#xD;
      bubbling method, aspirate appearance, chest radiography (CXR) and gastrografin .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Review of data in numerous studies has revealed that many of these techniques may not provide&#xD;
      fully accurate results, possibly leading to the potential for patient injuries, and even&#xD;
      fatal complications. Auscultation, bubbling method, and aspirate appearance have been&#xD;
      demonstrated to provide findings that can be misinterpreted and cause false assurance of&#xD;
      correct placement. Several deaths and serious injuries have been attributed to the use of&#xD;
      litmus paper in verification of feeding tube placement and subsequent utilization of the tube&#xD;
      as well as G-tube replacement. Consequently, litmus paper is no longer considered to be a&#xD;
      safe and effective confirmatory test for feeding tube placement or G-tube replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the gold standard for verification of feeding tube placement is CXR or abdominal&#xD;
      x-ray and G-tube replacement in an acute care setting is abdominal x-ray with gastrografin.&#xD;
      This method is time-consuming, costly, and results in an increase in patient exposure to&#xD;
      radiation. In addition for a patient who resides outside of the hospital setting at the time&#xD;
      of needed G-tube replacement there is additional costs of transport to and from the ED. An&#xD;
      alternative to CXR is measurement of gastric content pH level. This is a confirmed and valid&#xD;
      tool for nasogastric/orogastric (NG/OG) verification and a recognized replacement of the&#xD;
      litmus paper test.A pH level of 4.5 or less has been validated to indicate presence of&#xD;
      gastric contents. A drawback to the use of typical pH indicators alone is that they require&#xD;
      fluid aspirate to be placed manually onto the indicator surface. This increases the risk of&#xD;
      exposure to bodily fluids for medical personnel. Thus, the ideal device to determine accurate&#xD;
      feeding tube placement and G-tube replacement is one that will precisely measure the acid&#xD;
      (pH) level of aspirate and significantly reduce the risk of bodily fluid exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RightSpot pH Indicator &amp; RightLevel pH Detector are devices which purport to meet both of&#xD;
      these criteria. Both can provide an accurate pH level. The pH paper is encased in a&#xD;
      protective exterior that can be attached directly to a syringe, thus, decreasing the&#xD;
      likelihood of accidental exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the use of this novel device to accurately verify feeding tube&#xD;
      placement in an ICU care setting and G-tube replacement (of foley catheter) by measuring the&#xD;
      pH and comparing this with gastrografin radiographic confirmation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The G-tube (or foley catheter) will be placed by the treating physician, resident, mid-level&#xD;
      provider or nurse as per policy and standard of care in the ICU or Emergency Department.&#xD;
      Prior to x-ray confirmation of placement with gastrografin, the RightBio Metrics device will&#xD;
      be placed on the tube as per manufacturer's instructions and stomach contents aspirated. The&#xD;
      reading of the pH indicator and time it took to measure the pH will be recorded. The device&#xD;
      will then be removed. Tube placement verification by x-ray will be done as per hospital&#xD;
      protocol. The time of radiology reading of the x-ray will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures for feeding tube are similar, however two pH measurements will be obtained. The&#xD;
      first measurement will be obtained with RightSpot pH Indicator at the time the tube is&#xD;
      inserted into the stomach to measure gastric pH, and the second pH measurement will be&#xD;
      obtained one hour later with RightLevel pH Detector to assess whether or not a pH change has&#xD;
      occurred that suggests the tube has migrated into the small bowel. Radiographic confirmation&#xD;
      will also be obtained at that time as it is the standard of care for feeding tube placements&#xD;
      at SLU Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevant aspects of subject's prior history will be recorded on a standardized data&#xD;
      collection form (DCF). These include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgical history - when the G-tube was placed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Current medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any previous gastric bypass surgery or other GI surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Use of acid-reducing medications in the past week (e.g. antacids, proton pump&#xD;
           inhibitors, histamine antagonists)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Relevant medical history (e.g. gastric ulcer, achlorhydria)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cost related information such as ambulance cost to and from ED, cost of x-ray for G-tube&#xD;
           (or foley) replacement, cost of radiographic interpretation&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this is a minimal risk device and the main endpoint is whether or not the device could&#xD;
      determine placement of a feeding tube or G-tube, patients will not be followed beyond 24&#xD;
      hours.&#xD;
