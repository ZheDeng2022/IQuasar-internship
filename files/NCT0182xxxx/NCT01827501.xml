      This study is designed to compare the incidence of postoperative delirium in older patients&#xD;
      after major non-cardiac surgery with different perioperative hemodynamic managements: a goal&#xD;
      directed hemodynamic management group and a control group&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Delirium is a common postoperative complication in the elderly. The incidence depends on&#xD;
      several factors like the comorbidities of the patient and the type of surgery. Mortality is&#xD;
      almost twofold increased after two years for patients suffering from delirium after surgery.&#xD;
      Different studies showed that with a multimodal strategy it was possible to reduce the risk&#xD;
      of delirium. As several different organ systems are involved in the development of delirium&#xD;
      the patient's hemodynamic state seems to be important and is a target point of intervention.&#xD;
      Also sufficient perfusion and oxygen delivery is essential in order to avoid impairment of&#xD;
      the brain. Recent studies showed that goal directed hemodynamic management can reduce all&#xD;
      kind of postoperative complications and improve outcome. However, whether the use of&#xD;
      goal-directed hemodynamic management also improves the neurological outcome and reduces the&#xD;
      rates of postoperative delirium has not been studied yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of this study is to investigate the impact of goal directed hemodynamic management using&#xD;
      pulse contour analysis on the incidence of delirium in older patients undergoing non-cardiac&#xD;
      surgery, presenting with an intermediate to high risk for delirium. This risk will be&#xD;
      assessed preoperatively using a score suggested by Marcantonio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized in one of two groups, the goal-directed therapy group and the&#xD;
      control group. In the goal-directed therapy (GDT) group hemodynamic management is performed&#xD;
      according to an established algorithm obtained by pulse contour analysis. To prove our theory&#xD;
      that goal-directed therapy influences the brain by increasing oxygen supply we will use near&#xD;
      infrared spectroscopy, which is safe and non-invasive, in our patients. The hemodynamic&#xD;
      management is continued in the recovery room or at the intensive care unit according to the&#xD;
      mentioned algorithm. The intervention will be terminated as soon as patients fulfil the&#xD;
      standard criteria for discharge from recovery room or intensive care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the control group hemodynamic management is performed according to heart rate and blood&#xD;
      pressure without using extended monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the actual incidence has a significant impact on the number needed per group, we are going&#xD;
      to perform an interims analysis after 100 included patients according to the O'Brian-Fleming&#xD;
      technique. Is the difference of delirium between the two groups significant with an α &lt; 0,002&#xD;
      the study will be finished. Otherwise, the sample size needed per group will be determined&#xD;
      assuming an α = 0,048, a two-tailed test and a power of 80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      UPDATE 19-10-2016:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interims-analysis of incidences after 100 patients revealed, that 86 patients per group&#xD;
      will be needed (α = 0,048, power 80%).&#xD;
