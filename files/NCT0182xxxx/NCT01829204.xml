  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify and elucidate the pattern and perhaps role of&#xD;
      atypical proteins, cytokines and vaginal microbial flora in the pathogenic mechanisms&#xD;
      involved in the development of vulvodynia, recurrent fungal and bacterial vaginosis and&#xD;
      preterm labor.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our approach specifically targets the evaluation of the proteins and cytokines present and&#xD;
      the bacteriological analysis of the microflora in the vaginal milieu.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conjectures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An initial insult in the vagina (possibly involving a bacterial, viral or fungal&#xD;
           organism or their products) causes modifications in the vaginal milieu&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The vaginal milieu responds to the insult by developing an inflammatory reaction&#xD;
           characterized by cytokine and protein production&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Long lasting or repetitive insults maintain biochemical changes in the vaginal milieu&#xD;
           producing a reaction, chemical irritation or micro flora alteration by changes in&#xD;
           proteins and/or abnormal protein production&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Those changes eventually result in hypersensitivity, irritation, burning, and pain&#xD;
           manifested in patients with vulvodynia. And those changes may also result in the&#xD;
           recurrence of fungal or bacterial infections&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Those changes may also contribute to initiate the cascade of premature events conducting&#xD;
           to cervical effacement and dilation observed in preterm labor&#xD;
&#xD;
      The conjectures will be investigated by using a multidisciplinary approach including:&#xD;
      microbiology, proteomics and cytokines evaluation of the vaginal milieu. Specifically we will&#xD;
      be comparing an asymptomatic female population to serve as a baseline to patients affected by&#xD;
      vulvodynia, recurrent fungal or bacterial vaginosis and/or pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, descriptive study of about 550 women age 12 to 75 years. There will be&#xD;
      four groups: 1) Asymptomatic healthy women, 2) Women being seen for any gynecological&#xD;
      vulvovaginal condition, and 3) Pregnant women who are asymptomatic and healthy, and 4)&#xD;
      Pregnant women have any gynecological vulvovaginal condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will evaluate the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Types of cytokines normally present in women and in patients with vulvodynia, recurrent&#xD;
           fungal and bacterial vaginosis and preterm labor&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Normal microbiology flora in women and variations present in the vaginal milieu in these&#xD;
           patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The presence of normal and atypical proteins in the vaginal milieu of healthy women and&#xD;
           patients with vulvodynia, recurrent fungal and bacterial vaginosis and preterm labor&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Informed consent will be obtained and documented for participation in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comprehensive history assessment of environmental factors, topical vulvovaginal issues&#xD;
           and co morbid conditions as defined in the exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pelvic examination to obtain two samples via cotton swabs for proteomics, cytokines,&#xD;
           vaginal lactobacillus from vaginal secretions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Swab procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cotton swabs (2) will be introduced only in the middle vagina, one at the time, no other&#xD;
      areas will be sampled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Swab processing One swab will be placed in a special room temperature solution. This&#xD;
      de-identified swab will be mailed for Lactobacillus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second de-identified swab is to be place in 2 separated micro-containers in Liquid&#xD;
      Nitrogen Containers (one for cytokines and one for Proteomics). When 50 samples are completed&#xD;
      they will be processed at TTUHSC Permian Basin campus, with the Proteomics testing being done&#xD;
      in Lubbock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, there are 3 samples, each processed differently. Data will be recorded in a&#xD;
      confidential manner with no personal identifiers, only an assigned study subject number. As&#xD;
      such, the de-identified data may serve as a database for additional studies. The computer&#xD;
      used will belong to TTUHSC and be password protected, access limited to only authorized&#xD;
      personnel. Consent forms will be stored separately from the study data in the research&#xD;
      office.&#xD;
