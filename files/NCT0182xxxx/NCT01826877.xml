      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of autologous dendritic cells in&#xD;
      treating patients with metastatic kidney cancer. Vaccines made from a person's tumor cells&#xD;
      and white blood cells may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of dendritic cell (DC)-AdGM carbonic anhydrase IX&#xD;
      (CAIX) administered by intradermal injections at study doses and schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate clinical antitumor effects following study treatment according to Response&#xD;
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline version 1.1. Parameters include&#xD;
      objective response (complete response [CR], partial response [PR]), duration of response in&#xD;
      patients with objective response, and time to disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate immune responses to DC-AdGMCAIX vaccination by enzyme-linked immunospot&#xD;
      (ELISpot) for numeric determination of CAIX specific T cells in blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate immune responses to DC-AdGMCAIX vaccination by cytokine profiling of T cell&#xD;
      culture supernatants for characterization of the immune response in subjects with&#xD;
      demonstrated immune activation may be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate immune responses to DC-AdGMCAIX vaccination by anti-sargramostim (GM-CSF)&#xD;
      antibody response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To evaluate tumor biopsies for immune cell infiltrates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive AdGMCAIX-transduced autologous dendritic cells intradermally (ID) on days 1,&#xD;
      15, and 29.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2-3 months for at least 6&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
