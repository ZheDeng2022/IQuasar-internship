  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects that have relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma are invited to take part in this gene&#xD;
      transfer research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have found from previous research that we can put a new gene called a chimeric antigen&#xD;
      receptor (CAR) into T cells that will make them recognize neuroblastoma cells and kill them.&#xD;
      In a previous clinical trial, we used a CAR that recognizes GD2, a protein found on almost&#xD;
      all neuroblastoma cells (GD2-CAR). We put this gene into T cells and gave them back to&#xD;
      patients that had neuroblastoma. The infusions were safe and in patients with disease at the&#xD;
      time of their infusion, the time to progression was longer if we could find GD2 T cells in&#xD;
      their blood for more than 6 weeks. Because of this, we think that if T cells are able to last&#xD;
      longer, they may have a better chance of killing neuroblastoma tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, in this study we will add new genes to the GD2 T cells that can cause the cells to&#xD;
      live longer. These new genes are called CD28 and OX40. The purpose of this study will be to&#xD;
      determine the highest dose of iC9-GD2-CD28-OX40 (iC9-GD2) T cells that can safely be given to&#xD;
      patients with relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In other clinical studies using T cells, some investigators found that giving chemotherapy&#xD;
      before the T cell infusion can improve the amount of time the T cells stay in the body and&#xD;
      therefore the effect the T cells can have. This is called lymphodepletion and we think that&#xD;
      it will allow the T cells we infuse to expand and stay longer in the body, and potentially&#xD;
      kill cancer cells more effectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The chemotherapy we will use for lymphodepletion is a combination of cyclophosphamide and&#xD;
      fludarabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, to effectively kill the tumor cells, it is important that the T cells are able&#xD;
      to survive and expand in the tumor. Recent studies have shown that solid tumors release a&#xD;
      substance (PD1) that can inhibit T cells after they arrive into the tumor tissue. In an&#xD;
      attempt to overcome the effect of PD1 in neuroblastoma we will also give a medication called&#xD;
      pembrolizumab.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will make iC9-GD2 T cells by infecting normal T cells with a retroviral vector containing&#xD;
      the iC9-GD2 gene. After the new gene has been put into the T cells, the cells will be tested&#xD;
      to make sure that they kill GD2-positive neuroblastoma cells and then will be either given&#xD;
      fresh or frozen until the patient is ready for their infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, patients will receive cyclophosphamide and fludarabine intravenously (through a needle&#xD;
      inserted into a vein or your port-a-cath) for 2 days and then fludarabine alone for one day&#xD;
      (Day -4, -3,-2). On the next day (Day -1) patients will receive the drug called pembrolizumab&#xD;
      intravenously. Finally on Day 0 patients will be given an infusion of iC9 GD2 T cells into&#xD;
      the vein through an IV line at the assigned dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The iC9-GD2 T cell infusion will be given by the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy at Texas&#xD;
      Children's Hospital or Houston Methodist Hospital. The infusion will take between 5 and 10&#xD;
      minutes. Patients may need to stay in Houston for up to 4 weeks after the infusion so we can&#xD;
      monitor them for side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 21 (at the time of the week 3 visit), if the treatment was well tolerated, patients&#xD;
      will receive another dose of pembrolizumab intravenously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be follow-up visits every 1-2 weeks during the first 2 months and then they will&#xD;
      be spaced out over a total of 15 years. Because the cells are modified with a new gene we&#xD;
      must follow patients for at least 15 years to see if there are any long term side effects of&#xD;
      gene transfer. During the visits, we will see how the patients are doing and during certain&#xD;
      time points we will obtain extra blood samples to learn more about the way the iC9-GD2 T&#xD;
      cells are working and how long they last in the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After disease re-evaluation, if disease has not gotten worse, or if in the future it seems&#xD;
      that patient might benefit and they have not had a severe side effect caused by the infusion&#xD;
      of their iC9-GD2 T cells, patients may be eligible to receive up to 2 additional doses of&#xD;
      their T cells. Each dose will be at the same dose level as their first infusion and separated&#xD;
      by at least 6 weeks such that we can make sure patients have no severe side effects between&#xD;
      infusions. If patients receive additional doses of iC9-GD2 T-cells, they may need to stay in&#xD;
      Houston for up to 4 weeks after the infusion as well so we can monitor them for side effects.&#xD;
      If there were no severe side effects from pembrolizumab, patients will receive pembrolizumab&#xD;
      again with the iC9 GD2 T cells on the day before the T cell injection and 21 days after the T&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
