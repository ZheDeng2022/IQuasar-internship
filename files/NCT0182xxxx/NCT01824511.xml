      The most widely-accepted animal model of nicotine withdrawal states stopping nicotine makes&#xD;
      rewarding events become less rewarding. The current study will test if this is true in&#xD;
      humans. If we find tobacco abstinence does make rewards less rewarding, this would suggest&#xD;
      new symptoms to add to official descriptions of nicotine withdrawal. It would also suggest we&#xD;
      need to develop new behavioral and pharmacological interventions to correct this problem. If&#xD;
      stopping smoking does not make rewards less rewarding, this would suggest this animal model&#xD;
      does not apply to the human condition and we need to continue to search for an animal model&#xD;
      of tobacco withdrawal that is relevant to smokers stopping smoking.&#xD;

      Study design We will recruit until we have 70 current smokers who want to quit at two sites&#xD;
      (Univ of Vermont and Dartmouth Medical School). We will also recruit a comparison group of 70&#xD;
      long-time former smokers to assist in interpretation of the results. In the first week,&#xD;
      smokers will smoke their usual number of cigs/day. They will then quit and are to remain&#xD;
      abstinent for 4 weeks. We will use a schedule of escalating monetary contingencies based on&#xD;
      breath and saliva and/or urine samples to encourage abstinence. We will obtain dependent&#xD;
      measures twice/week. The primary measures of reward responsivity will be the percent choosing&#xD;
      the hard task and the amount of responding for a monetary reward on the EEfRT task and the&#xD;
      score on our Rewarding Events scale. Other outcomes will be delay discounting results and&#xD;
      self-reports of anhedonia and apathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will run for 1 week pre-cessation (2 visits) and then for 4 weeks post-cessation.&#xD;
      Measures and biochemical verifications will occur twice/wk. Former smokers will attend once a&#xD;
      wee for four weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the first week of abstinence, the cutoff for nonsmoking will be CO &lt;8 ppm. For the&#xD;
      remaining weeks, abstinence will be verified with a score of 0 (&lt;10 ng/ml of cotinine) on a&#xD;
      test strip in a saliva or urine sample plus a CO &lt;8 ppm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the initial session, completion of baseline surveys will describe the sample and also&#xD;
      measure plausible moderators such as depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We believe the most direct test of reward sensitivity is an evaluation of the influence of&#xD;
      abstinence on operant responding for a reward. Thus, we have chosen performance on the Effort&#xD;
      Expenditure for Rewards Task (EEfRT), which examines responding as a function of response&#xD;
      cost, reward magnitude and probability of reward, as one of our primary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For a self-report measure we will use our Rewarding Events (RE) scale that asks both about&#xD;
      occurrence of presumed rewarding events and their anticipated pleasantness. Our RE scale will&#xD;
      ask participants to rate 58 items on frequency in the last week as well perceived/expected&#xD;
      pleasantness of events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary measures include the 18-item Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES), the Temporal Experience&#xD;
      of Pleasure (TEPS), Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal Scale-Revised (MNWS), and a measure of&#xD;
      delay discounting (DD).&#xD;
