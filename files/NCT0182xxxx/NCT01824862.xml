      Clinically significant macular edema (CSME) is a thickening of the macula associated with the&#xD;
      risk of visual loss, which increases its centre is involved. Functional evaluation of the&#xD;
      macula relies on best corrected visual acuity; however, neural dysfunction in diabetic eyes&#xD;
      appears before retinal thickening and visual loss. Retinal sensitivity decreases in eyes with&#xD;
      CSME, but it is unknown whether it differs between eyes with and without centre thickening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To compare the reduction of foveal sensitivity in eyes with CSME, with and without&#xD;
      centre thickening.&#xD;

      A non-experimental, comparative, prospective, cross-sectional study was conducted. Target&#xD;
      population were type 2 diabetics, from Mexico City and its metropolitan area, and available&#xD;
      population were type 2 diabetics who attended an Ophthalmology service from a general&#xD;
      hospital in Mexico City, from September 2011 to May 2012.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type 2 diabetic patients aged 30-85 years, from any gender, with central fixation, whose&#xD;
      ocular media allowed obtaining an adequate quality Optical Coherence Tomography, who had CSME&#xD;
      with focal angiographic pattern were included. Eyes with optic nerve or visual pathways&#xD;
      diseases or any other ocular disease that decreased Best corrected visual acuity, were&#xD;
      excluded. Diabetic patients without retinopathy who fulfilled the remaining selection&#xD;
      criteria were evaluated as the reference group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixty degrees colour fundus photographs were obtained in all the patients using a Visucam&#xD;
      lite ocular fundus camera; in group 1 it was verified that no signs of diabetic retinopathy&#xD;
      existed in the photographs; CSMO was diagnosed by biomicroscopy under mydryasis, according to&#xD;
      the ETDRS criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retinal thickness was measured using Stratus optical coherence tomography (OCT), version&#xD;
      4.0.1 (Zeiss). The 6 mm fast macular map strategy was used, according to the following&#xD;
      standardised operating procedure: mydriasis ≥6mm, inclusion of the spherical equivalent and&#xD;
      anteroposterior axis, and optimisation of z axis and of polarisation; the photograph was&#xD;
      taken with flash between 9:00 and 11:00, using an acquisition strategy for dark irises. The&#xD;
      maps were obtained by the same investigator, independent from the one who evaluated the&#xD;
      patients clinically; any deviation of the OCT line regarding the actual retina boundary was&#xD;
      considered as a measurement error.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 10° macular perimetry was obtained in all the patients, using a Humphrey field analyser&#xD;
      model 750i (software version 4.1); the sixteen points evaluated were arbitrarily labelled.&#xD;
      Retinal thickness within 3 mm from the centre of the fovea was measured in 9 fields,&#xD;
      according to the fast macular map.&#xD;
