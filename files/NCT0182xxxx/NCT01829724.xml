      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Two ways to study the brain while people are moving are near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)&#xD;
      and electroencephalography (EEG). NIRS uses light to look at blood flow in the brain when it&#xD;
      is active. EEG records electrical activity in the brain. Both have been used safely for many&#xD;
      years, even in very young children. NIRS or EEG can be used while a person is moving to show&#xD;
      which parts of the brain are the most active. Researchers want to use NIRS and EEG to study&#xD;
      brain activity during movement in people with cerebral palsy and healthy volunteers. Learning&#xD;
      more about how people with and without cerebral palsy use their brain to control their&#xD;
      muscles may lead to new ways of training people with cerebral palsy to move better.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study how the brain controls body movement in people with and without cerebral palsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals at least 5 years of age who have cerebral palsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers at least 5 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study has three parts. People with cerebral palsy will be selected for all three.&#xD;
           Healthy volunteers will be asked to do only two of them. Everyone who participates will&#xD;
           have NIRS and/or EEG exams during movement. People with cerebral palsy may also have&#xD;
           biofeedback sessions to train coordination of movement and brain activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Urine samples&#xD;
           may be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will have at least one session of NIRS and/or EEG imaging studies.&#xD;
           Sessions may also include the following tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic resonance imaging to look at the brain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electromyography to measure electrical activity of the muscles&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Motion analysis of specific body parts&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ultrasound to measure activity of the muscles&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Motorized, robotic, and electrical stimulation of the muscles&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other clinical tests of muscle movement as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants with cerebral palsy will have biofeedback sessions. These sessions will&#xD;
           help them learn to coordinate muscle movement and brain activity.&#xD;

      Objective Neural imaging during functional tasks has become more portable and accessible than&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) by utilizing non-invasive near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)&#xD;
      as a means to isolate areas of brain activity by measuring blood flow dynamics and&#xD;
      electroencephalography (EEG) to measure electrical activity on the cortical surface. Although&#xD;
      use of these technologies for assessing cortical activation patterns is increasing,&#xD;
      validation of these approaches, particularly in children with brain injuries such as cerebral&#xD;
      palsy is in the early stages with few reports in the literature. The use of these in motor&#xD;
      training paradigms for rehabilitation populations has not yet been reported. The objectives&#xD;
      of this protocol are to: 1) systematically compare cortical activation patterns associated&#xD;
      with specified motor and sensory tasks in healthy children and adults to those with&#xD;
      unilateral or bilateral childhood-onset brain injury 2) extend the use of EEG in our&#xD;
      laboratory across subject groups and tasks, when used alone or with NIRS; and 3) pilot the&#xD;
      use of NIRS and/ or EEG as a brain biofeedback device in children with childhood-onset brain&#xD;
      or peripheral injuries. The first two objectives are observational only, the third objective&#xD;
      includes a pilot intervention. The results of this study are expected to increase knowledge&#xD;
      of brain activation patterns across tasks and groups with and without brain injuries and to&#xD;
      provide proof of concept and power estimates for future clinical studies with these&#xD;
      technologies. A secondary question we would like to examine with these imaging technologies&#xD;
      is the potential effect of motor impairments resulting from childhood-onset peripheral&#xD;
      injuries (e.g. obstetrical brachial plexus palsy) on brain reorganization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population The childhood-onset brain injury group will consist of up to120 individuals&#xD;
      (5 years and above) spanning the three objectives. The childhood-onset peripheral injury&#xD;
      group will consist of up to 100 individuals within the same age-range spanning only&#xD;
      Objectives 1 and 2. The control groups for each participant cohort will consist of up to 50&#xD;
      individuals spanning Objectives 1 and 2, for a total recruitment of up to 100 healthy&#xD;
      volunteers within the same age range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design Objective 1, the primary focus of this research protocol, is a cross-sectional&#xD;
      analysis of multiple tasks across subject groups with and without motor impairments.&#xD;
      Objective 2 is primarily a descriptive study, and Objective 3 is a pilot evaluation of the&#xD;
      effectiveness of novel short term motor training program in children with childhood-onset&#xD;
      brain injury targeted at improving brain activation patterns and motor performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures Objective 1 is the primary quantitative objective in this protocol, in which&#xD;
      we will compare location, magnitude, volume and area of cortical activation across tasks and&#xD;
      groups. Secondary outcomes include descriptive measures that will be used primarily to&#xD;
      evaluate the two techniques or to monitor motion and muscle activation (EMG and ultrasound)&#xD;
      data to help interpret task and group differences. Objective 3 will measure changes in brain&#xD;
      activation and motor performance in childhood-onset brain injury before and after a short&#xD;
      training program.&#xD;
