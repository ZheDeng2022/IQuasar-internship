    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of Community&#xD;
      Reinforcement Training (CRT) provided in a group therapy format. The goals of CRT are to&#xD;
      teach parents behavioral and communication skills to influence their youth's drug use and&#xD;
      encourage them to enter treatment. Thirty parents will be randomly assigned to Group CRT and&#xD;
      30 will be randomly assigned to traditional, Individual CRT. Youth engaged in treatment will&#xD;
      receive individual Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. Families are assessed for adolescent&#xD;
      substance use and other areas of individual and family functioning. It is expected that Group&#xD;
      CRT will be more effective for encouraging youth entry into treatment and improving parental&#xD;
      functioning.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Very few youth with drug abuse or dependence in the United States receive treatment. This&#xD;
      population of untreated youth represents a massive &quot;treatment gap&quot; in adolescent health care&#xD;
      that renders impotent a potentially important avenue for preventing chronic drug abuse and&#xD;
      related difficulties. The lack of motivation for treatment characterizing most adolescent&#xD;
      drug abusers significantly decreases the likelihood these youth will enter treatment, barring&#xD;
      mandates from the legal system or other social institutions. Efficacy studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated that Community Reinforcement Training (CRT), an approach that involves teaching&#xD;
      parents how to engage their youth into treatment, can work to recruit 60-80% of these&#xD;
      treatment-elusive youth. CRT is traditionally provided in an individual therapy format to one&#xD;
      or both parents. This study will improve upon our prior work by using a group format to&#xD;
      provide a less costly procedure for engaging youth into treatment and to make it more&#xD;
      portable to treatment agencies, schools, juvenile justice, and other community organizations&#xD;
      seeking to offer support to parents or engage youth in treatment, thus significantly&#xD;
      increasing the adoption and sustainability of the approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will examine the efficacy of the group format (G-CRT) for helping parents engage&#xD;
      their unmotivated, resistant youth in treatment compared to the traditional individual format&#xD;
      (I-CRT). Parents (n = 60) will be randomly assigned to G-CRT or to I-CRT. We will evaluate&#xD;
      the differential efficacy of G-CRT, relative to I-CRT, on rates of adolescent engagement in&#xD;
      treatment. We expect that G-CRT, compared to I-CRT, will also be associated with greater&#xD;
      parent encouragement of adolescent sobriety, perceived social support, and family&#xD;
      functioning. We also predict that changes on these process variables will predict increased&#xD;
      success in engaging adolescents. We will also examine treatment outcomes for youth engaged in&#xD;
      Cognitive Behavioral Therapy as a function of parental involvement in G-CRT or I-CRT. We&#xD;
      predict enhanced support received by parents in G-CRT will result in greater reductions in&#xD;
      drug use and lower levels of HIV-risk behaviors, outcomes hypothesized to be mediated by&#xD;
      motivation to change and sessions attendance. Finally, we will conduct an informal&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness analysis to derive preliminary estimates of the relative costs of each&#xD;
      treatment modality per outcome unit and hypothesize that G-CRT will be more cost effective&#xD;
      than I-CRT by virtue of having higher clinical effectiveness and lower costs. Successful&#xD;
      outcomes here will provide the basis for a full clinical trial with larger samples.&#xD;

    <measure>Timeline Followback (TLFB) interview</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>The TLFB is an interview to assess the quantity, frequency, and pattern of illicit substance use. Parents provide collateral data on their adolescents' substance use in the 3 months prior to enrollment. Adolescents report on their own substance use for the 3 months prior to their parents' enrollment through 6 months after enrollment.</description>

    <measure>Medical Outcome Studies Social Support Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>The MOS consists of four support subscales (Emotional/Informational, Tangible, Affectionate, and Positive Social) and an overall functional social support index. This measure will be completed by parents at baseline (about the 3 months prior to enrollment) and at 3- and 6-month follow-up points. It will be used to compare perceived social support for parents in the G-CRT versus I-CRT interventions.</description>
