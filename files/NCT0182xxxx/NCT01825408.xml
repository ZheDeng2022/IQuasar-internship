    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the best duration(3 versus 6 weeks) of antibiotics&#xD;
      as part of maximal medical therapy for treating chronic sinusitis and thus preventing&#xD;
      patients from having to have sinus surgery. The hypothesis is that in the context of maximal&#xD;
      medical therapy 3 weeks of antibiotics is not worse than 6 weeks of antibiotics at&#xD;
      successfully treating chronic sinusitis.&#xD;

      OVERVIEW This is a prospective randomized cohort study assessing duration of antibiotics (3&#xD;
      vs 6 weeks) as part of maximal medical therapy for chronic rhinosinusitis. Up to 100 subjects&#xD;
      will be prospectively enrolled from patients visiting the Department of Otolaryngology-Head&#xD;
      and Neck Surgery clinics at UNC Hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INITIAL CLINIC VISIT At the time of a clinical visit, the attending otolaryngologists will&#xD;
      identify their patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) who are appropriate for maximal&#xD;
      medical treatment, including antibiotics. They will introduce the study to these patients and&#xD;
      invite them to learn more about it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient is interested in learning more about the study, the study coordinators will be&#xD;
      contacted to provide additional information and, if the patient would like to participate in&#xD;
      the study, provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient is a premenopausal woman, she will be asked if she is pregnant or&#xD;
      breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If she is either of these, she will be excluded from the study. All remaining women will&#xD;
      receive a urine pregnancy test. If this urine pregnancy test is positive, the patient will be&#xD;
      excluded from the study. Thus, for premenopausal female patients, a negative urine pregnancy&#xD;
      test is necessary for inclusion in the study. These women will be informed that they should&#xD;
      use an effective method of birth control during the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Combined oral contraceptives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patch contraceptives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vaginal ring contraceptives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Injectable contraceptives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Implantable contraceptives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intrauterine devices or intrauterine systems&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tubal ligation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Barrier methods of contraception (male condom, female condom, cervical cap with&#xD;
           spermicide, or diaphragm with spermicide)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vasectomy of your partner in a monogamous relationship&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women enrolled in this study will be informed that if they have a failure of birth control&#xD;
      method during the course of the study or become pregnant during the study, they will be&#xD;
      withdrawn from the study and further treatment will be decided according to the clinical&#xD;
      withdrawn from the study and further treatment will be decided according to the clinical&#xD;
      expertise of the treating otolaryngologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study coordinators will assign the patients a unique Subject ID that will be used on&#xD;
           all patient forms with the exception of the informed consent documents and HIPAA&#xD;
           authorization forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient will fill out a demographics and past medical history form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Using a random-number generator, the patient will be randomized to receive either 3 or 6&#xD;
           weeks of antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The subject will initially be given a prescription for empiric antibiotics.The choice of&#xD;
           empiric antibiotics will differ based on the patient's nasal polyposis status:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the subject has CRS with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), s/he will be given Doxycycline&#xD;
           100mg BID or if allergic to doxycycline, then Augmentin 875mg BID for either 3 or 6&#xD;
           weeks duration. These patients will also receive a course of Prednisone (30mg x 3d, 20mg&#xD;
           x 3d, 10mg x3d, 10mg every other day for 6 days (3 doses)) which is standard of care&#xD;
           treatment for CRSwNP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the subject has CRS without Nasal Polyposis (CRSwNP), s/he will be given Azithromycin&#xD;
           250mg daily, or if allergic to azithromycin, then Augmentin 875mg BID for either 3 or 6&#xD;
           weeks duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If purulent nasal discharge is present that is appropriate for culture, the&#xD;
           otolaryngologists will send this for culture and sensitivity analysis, which they would&#xD;
           normally do as part of their routine clinical care. The patients will be informed that&#xD;
           if their culture and sensitivity analysis indicates that they have an infection that can&#xD;
           be treated with a less broad-spectrum antibiotic, then they will be prescribed&#xD;
           culture-directed antibiotics. Otherwise, the patient can continue empiric antibiotics as&#xD;
           previously specified.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All study participants will also be prescribed standard of care intranasal steroids, and&#xD;
           encouraged to perform BID saline sinus irrigation and use yogurt/over the counter&#xD;
           probiotics to reduce GI side effects of antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4-5 WEEKS AFTER BEGINNING TREATMENT For subjects randomized to the 3 week antibiotic group,&#xD;
      these subjects will been seen in clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this visit (study visit #2), subjects will be asked about antibiotic compliance and&#xD;
      side effects. Recommendation for sinus surgery will be evaluated with video-recorded nasal&#xD;
      endoscopy and a sinus CT and made based on clinical judgement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For subjects randomized to the 6 week antibiotic group, these subjects will be contacted by&#xD;
      phone by the study coordinator to assess side effects and medication compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7-8 WEEKS AFTER BEGINNING TREATMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      For subjects randomized to the 6 week antibiotic group, these subjects will been seen in&#xD;
      clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this visit (study visit #2), subjects will be asked about antibiotic compliance and&#xD;
      side effects. Recommendation for sinus surgery will be evaluated with video-recorded nasal&#xD;
      endoscopy and a sinus CT and made based on clinical judgement.&#xD;

        <description>Recommendation for sinus surgery after completion of maximal medical therapy is determined by the subject's treating physician and is based on two citeria: (1) persistence of symptoms and (2) objective evidence of disease on post-treatment sinus CT scan or nasal endoscopy. Symptomatic improvement of sinusitis symptoms will be assessed by: patient self report, change in Chronic Sinusitis Survery (CSS) score and change in RhinoSinusitis Disibility Index (RSDI) score relative to initial pre-antibiotic CSS and RSDI survey scores.</description>
