      The purpose of this study is to determine whether low level laser light therapy is effective&#xD;
      in reducing circumference of the waist, hips and upper abdomen in obese individuals.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) 2011 report states that the market for&#xD;
      cosmetic procedures has shown significant growth over the past two years, with 13.8 million&#xD;
      cosmetic plastic surgery procedures performed in the United States in 2011, up 5% since 2010.&#xD;
      While surgical cosmetic procedures did increase significantly from 2010 to 2011, the overall&#xD;
      growth in cosmetic procedures is being primarily driven by a substantial rise in&#xD;
      minimally-invasive procedures. Cosmetic minimally-invasive procedures increased 6%, with&#xD;
      nearly 12.2 million cosmetic minimally-invasive procedures having been performed in 2011.&#xD;
      This highlights the growing consumer demand for non- or minimally-invasive cosmetic&#xD;
      procedures that do not involve surgical procedures such as liposuction and the associated&#xD;
      risks, potential complications and lengthy and painful recovery processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low level laser light therapy, such as that to be provided through application of the&#xD;
      Erchonia® Obesity Laser in this clinical study protocol, offers a simple, non-invasive, safe,&#xD;
      effective and side-effect free alternative to achieving body circumference reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification for this assertion of anticipated safety and effectiveness of the application&#xD;
      of the Erchonia® Obesity Laser for the reduction of body circumference is found through three&#xD;
      FDA clearances for Erchonia® Low Level Laser devices for body circumference reduction&#xD;
      indications, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      K123237 (532 nm green light diodes): Erchonia® Zerona™ 2.0 Laser: is indicated for use as a&#xD;
      non-invasive dermatological aesthetic treatment as an adjunct for individuals intending to&#xD;
      undergo liposuction procedures for the reduction of circumference of hips, waist, and thighs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      K121695 &amp; K082609 (635 nm red light diodes): Erchonia® ML Scanner (MLS) &amp; Erchonia® Zerona:&#xD;
      is indicated for use as a non-invasive dermatological aesthetic treatment as an adjunct for&#xD;
      individuals intending to undergo liposuction procedures for the reduction of circumference of&#xD;
      hips, waist, and thighs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      K121690 &amp; K120257 (635 nm red light diodes): Erchonia® MLS, Zerona, Zerona-AD: is indicated&#xD;
      for use as a non-invasive dermatological aesthetic treatment as an adjunct for individuals&#xD;
      intending to undergo liposuction procedures for the reduction of circumference of the upper&#xD;
      arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, Erchonia low level lasers have been determined safe and effective by the FDA for&#xD;
      application for body circumference reduction indications for multiple body areas, such that&#xD;
      evaluation of application of the Erchonia Obesity Laser to reducing body circumference in&#xD;
      more overweight individuals is a natural extension of its proven and accepted application for&#xD;
      body circumference reduction purposes.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline and 4 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Individual measurements in inches of the waist, hips and upper abdomen were combined to calculate a total body circumference measurement. Change in combined circumference measurement from baseline to 4 weeks was calculated for each subject. Individual subject success was defined as a change of 3.0 inches or more in the combined circumference measurement across the evaluation period. A decrease in combined circumference measurement is positive for individual subject success. An increase in combined circumference measurement is negative for individual subject success. Overall study success was defined as a 40% or greater difference between the proportion of individual successes in each treatment group.</description>

    <description>Individual measurements in inches of the waist, hips and upper abdomen were combined to calculate a total combined body circumference measurement. Change in combined circumference measurement is calculated as the difference in circumference measurements from baseline to endpoint (4 weeks). A negative (-) change indicates a decrease in circumference and is positive for study success. A positive (+) change indicates an increase in circumference and is negative for study success.</description>

        <title>Difference in the Proportion of Primary Outcome Successes Between Treatment Groups for Change in Combined Circumference Measurements</title>
        <description>Individual measurements in inches of the waist, hips and upper abdomen were combined to calculate a total body circumference measurement. Change in combined circumference measurement from baseline to 4 weeks was calculated for each subject. Individual subject success was defined as a change of 3.0 inches or more in the combined circumference measurement across the evaluation period. A decrease in combined circumference measurement is positive for individual subject success. An increase in combined circumference measurement is negative for individual subject success. Overall study success was defined as a 40% or greater difference between the proportion of individual successes in each treatment group.</description>
