  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy of ultra low dose danazol (Optina) for the treatment of&#xD;
      diabetic macular edema versus placebo. Optina has already been granted 505(b)2 status by the&#xD;
      FDA and will incorporate all safety data from prior FDA approvals. Additional safety data&#xD;
      will be collected specifically for this low dosage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will identify a population of subjects where Optina demonstrates a therapeutic&#xD;
      effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A portion of 505(b)2 drugs are approved based on a single clinical trial.&#xD;

             membrane)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. An ocular condition is present such that, in the opinion of the Investigator, VA would&#xD;
             not improve from resolution of macular edema (e.g., foveal atrophy, closure of&#xD;
             juxafoveal capillaries, dense subfoveal hard exudates)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. An ocular condition (other than diabetic retinopathy) that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator, might affect macular edema or alter VA during the course of the study,&#xD;
             e.g., vein occlusion, uveitis or other ocular inflammatory disease, Irvine-Gass&#xD;
             Syndrome, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Substantial cataract that, in the opinion of the Investigator, is likely to interfere&#xD;
             with ocular measurements or evaluations during this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. History of treatment for DME at any time in the past 8 weeks (such as focal/grid&#xD;
             macular photocoagulation, intravitreal or peribulbar corticosteroids, anti-vascular&#xD;
             endothelial growth factor [VEGF drugs], or any other treatment). Note, the 28-day&#xD;
             screening period allows subjects to be screened at 4 weeks post DME treatment and have&#xD;
             a baseline visit 28 days later.&#xD;

          6. History of panretinal scatter photocoagulation (PRP) within 4 months prior to&#xD;
             randomization or anticipated need for PRP in the 6 months following randomization&#xD;

             intraocular surgery, etc.) within prior 6 months or anticipated within the next 6&#xD;
             months following randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. History of YAG capsulotomy performed within 2 months prior to randomization&#xD;
