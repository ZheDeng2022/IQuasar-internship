  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this prospective pilot study is to evaluate the use of remote technology (iBGStar&#xD;
      in combination with Diabetes Manager App on iPhone) to patient related outcomes, and a&#xD;
      hypoglycemia fear questionnaire. In the future, this study might lead to investigating the&#xD;
      role of social media with mobile phones in Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) care. Moreover, the number&#xD;
      of patients with T1D continues to increase, and such technology could conceivably help&#xD;
      compensate for the shortages of endocrinologists providing care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, prospective, randomized, 'open-label,' investigator initiated pilot&#xD;
      study evaluating the role of mobile technology to improve diabetes care in adults with type 1&#xD;
      diabetes (REMOTE-T1D). We hypothesize that the use of mobile technology (iBGStar® technology&#xD;
      [iPhone® plus the BGStar®]) will result in improvement in Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO),&#xD;
      and Treatment Satisfactions with a possible reductions of glucose excursions, A1c, and severe&#xD;
      hypoglycemia as compared to routine clinical care using traditional glucose meter&#xD;
      SMBG-Accu-chek®. This study aims to demonstrate the efficacy of these technologies in a&#xD;
      clinical setting with a hope to improve outcomes and health care cost savings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll 100 patients from the Barbara Davis Center Adult clinic over the age of&#xD;
      18 years who will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to intervention group using mobile&#xD;
      technology (iBG Star) vs. continued routine clinical care (control) using SMBG-Accu-chek&#xD;
      meter. All subjects will be followed for study visits with similar frequency at baseline,&#xD;
      1-week, 1-month, 3-months, and 6-months and wear a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) using a&#xD;
      DexCom SEVEN Plus® system in a blinded mode for 7 days at baseline (wk0), 1mo, 3mo, and 6mo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory analysis for A1c will be performed at baseline, 1-month 3-months, and 6-months.&#xD;
      Routine blood tests will be performed in all subjects at baseline, 3months, and 6-months.&#xD;
      Blinded CGM data will be analyzed for mean blood glucose values, time spent in hyperglycemic&#xD;
      (&gt;240, &gt;300mg/dl) and hypoglycemic (&lt;50, &lt;70, &lt;80 mg/dl) ranges and various indices of&#xD;
      glycemic variability.&#xD;
