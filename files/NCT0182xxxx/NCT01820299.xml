  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for subjects with solid cancers (gastrointestinal, lung, breast, prostate,&#xD;
      lymphoma or cancer of the lymph nodes). The overall goal of this study is to identify&#xD;
      plant-derived phytochemicals that can safely reduce systemic inflammation (inflammation&#xD;
      throughout the entire body) in subjects with advanced cancer.&#xD;

      This study will look at oligomeric procyanidin complex (OPC) and vitamin D3. OPC is the major&#xD;
      part of Grape Seed Extract (GSE). Researchers are in looking at the combination of GSE and&#xD;
      vitamin D in subjects with solid cancers (gastrointestinal, lung, breast, prostate, lymphoma&#xD;
      or cancer of the lymph nodes). Researchers will examine the safety of the GSE and vitamin D&#xD;
      when GSE is given at different doses. Researchers will also look at the effects of GSE and&#xD;
      vitamin D on your quality of life and your body. In particular, they will look at differences&#xD;
      in biomarkers in your blood and urine.&#xD;

    <measure>Maximally-tolerated dose of Grape Seed Extract in Patients with Solid Tumors</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Decisions to escalate or expand a dose level will be based only on the GSE-only treatment period (day 1-21). To be evaluable for toxicity, a patient must receive at least 3 weeks of GSE treatment, or have experienced dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). All patients enrolled are to be fully followed for toxicity, but any patients who are not evaluable for toxicity will be replaced.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>IL6 Response</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma IL-6 levels before and after 21 days and 63 days of GSE treatment will be quantified to estimate the dose response relationship between GSE dose and reduction in inflammation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Measurement of Other Inflammatory Markers</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Other markers that will be measured will include serum CRP, albumin, AGEs (advanced glycation end products), rAGE (soluble receptor for AGEs), 25-OH-vitamin D3, and urine for oxidative damage DNA biomarkers (urinary 8-oxoGua and 8-oxodG). Correlations between dose and change in these parameters from before to 21, 63 days after start of GSE dosing will be described.</description>

    <measure>Effect of Vitamin D3 on Anti-Inflammatory Effects of GSE</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The ability of a fixed dose of vitamin D3 (4000 IU daily) to further suppress IL-6 levels in subjects on GSE treatment will be evaluated.</description>
