  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open, randomized study involving 100 patients with microvascular&#xD;
      complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity, who will undergo gastric bypass&#xD;
      (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass ARM A) or receive best medical treatment (ARM B, control arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in the control&#xD;
      of diabetic nephropathy in diabetic patients with BMI between 30 and 35 kg/m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The medical community is confronted with many different studies using various methodologies&#xD;
      to investigate the best pharmacological treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus. The treatment&#xD;
      algorithm offers several different options according to the stage of the disease (which is&#xD;
      different in each study). In addition, new drugs are being developed over the years, but are&#xD;
      not always a guarantee of effective type 2 diabetes mellitus control [MENDES, 2010].&#xD;
      Furthermore, these drugs do not prevent the development of this disease, consequently&#xD;
      increasing the risks of microvascular and macrovascular complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conversely, there is considerable evidence that surgery can be an adequate tool to promote&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes mellitus remission in patients who are unresponsive to clinical treatment.&#xD;
      Gastric bypass surgery is one of the most popular bariatric surgeries in the world, but its&#xD;
      effects on microvascular and macrovascular complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus have not&#xD;
      been established. Specialists suggest that the rapid and uncontrollable decrease in blood&#xD;
      glucose adds to the concern that the surgery may paradoxically cause exacerbation of&#xD;
      microvascular complications [LEOW, 2005], whereas gradual improvement in blood glucose before&#xD;
      gastric bypass surgery may prevent this paradoxical worsening, leading to an interruption of&#xD;
      this process, or even retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there are no studies comparing the results of these two types of treatment (clinical&#xD;
      vs. surgical) in a similar population and assessing the development of microvascular&#xD;
      complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Therefore, in order to clarify such doubts, it is&#xD;
      necessary and extremely desirable to conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing gastric&#xD;
      bypass with the best and most modern clinical treatment. Its findings could have a direct&#xD;
      impact on hundreds of millions of diabetics by allowing the inclusion of surgical treatment&#xD;
      as a safe and feasible therapeutic option for a significant portion of these patients.&#xD;
