      The study will compare the rewarming effectiveness of heat donation through the distal arms&#xD;
      and legs during rewarming of mildly hypothermic subjects. Warming will be accomplished&#xD;
      through either warm water immersion; and fluidotherapy. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      fluidotherapy will be as, or more, effective compared to warm water immersion&#xD;

      Dr. Gordon Giesbrecht is studying/comparing the effectiveness of heat donation through the&#xD;
      distal arms and legs in rewarming a mildly hypothermic individual. Warming will be&#xD;
      accomplished through either warm water immersion; and fluidotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure. Eight participants will be cooled in 8°C water on three occasions and then warmed&#xD;
      by each of three warming conditions. The study will include following specific procedures:&#xD;
      Anthropometric data which includes age, weight, height, and measurements of skinfold&#xD;
      thickness at four sites- biceps, triceps, subscapularis, and suprailiac will be collected.&#xD;
      Participant's heart rate and electrocardiogram will be monitored continuously throughout the&#xD;
      experiment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be instrumented as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. About 12 heat flux disks (2 cm in diameter) will be taped to the skin on the arms, legs,&#xD;
           torso, head etc. to measure skin temperature and heat transfer from the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Three ECG leads will be affixed to the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Core temperature will be measured with a disposable esophageal thermocouple. A thin,&#xD;
           flexible tube will be inserted through the nose, to midway down the esophagus at the&#xD;
           level of the heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Oxygen consumption will be continuously measured with a metabolic cart. Participants&#xD;
           will be asked to wear a face mask which will collect the expired breath during the&#xD;
           cooling as well as the rewarming periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conditions: The three treatment methods are as follows.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Spontaneous rewarming (Shivering only) - In this control condition, no external heat will&#xD;
      be provided and the participant will rewarm spontaneously with the heat produced from&#xD;
      shivering.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Warm water distal extremities immersion - Distal arms and legs will be immersed in warm&#xD;
      water at 45°C for rewarming.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C.Fluidotherapy distal extremities rewarming - Distal arms and legs will be immersed in&#xD;
      Fluidotherapy equipment for rewarming at 50°C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rewarming procedures will be administered either for a period of 60 minutes or until core&#xD;
      temperature returns to normal values ( ̴ 36.5-37˚C). Following that, participants will be&#xD;
      placed in a warm water bath (40-42˚C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design: Each of the three experimental trials, separated by at least 48 hours. On&#xD;
      each of the three trials, participants will be immersed up to the level of the sternal notch&#xD;
      in 8˚C for up to 60 minutes or until the core temperature falls to 35˚C. The participant will&#xD;
      then exit the water, be dried off and rewarmed with either lie inside a vapor barrier within&#xD;
      a hooded sleeping bag with the head inside the hood, or sitting with their distal arms and&#xD;
      legs immersed in either Fluidotherapy at 50°C or warm water at 45°C. The rewarming will be&#xD;
      administered for 60 minutes or until the core temperature returns to normal values&#xD;
      (̴36.5-37˚C). The order of warming methods will follow a balanced design.&#xD;
