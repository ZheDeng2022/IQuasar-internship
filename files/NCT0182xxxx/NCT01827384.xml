    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies molecular profiling-based assignment of cancer therapy (MPACT) in&#xD;
      treating patients with solid tumors that have spread to other places in the body and usually&#xD;
      cannot be cured or controlled with treatment (advanced). Adavosertib, everolimus, and&#xD;
      trametinib are drugs that each target a specific variation in tumors by blocking different&#xD;
      proteins needed for cell growth. Veliparib blocks an enzyme that helps repair&#xD;
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damaged by chemotherapy, which may help chemotherapy drugs work&#xD;
      better. It is not yet known whether testing patients for variations in their tumor and&#xD;
      assigning treatment targeting the variation is more effective than standard non-targeted&#xD;
      therapy in treating advanced solid tumors.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the proportion of patients with objective response (OR) to targeted study&#xD;
      agent(s) in patients with advanced refractory cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 4 treatment regimens corresponding to one of their&#xD;
      mutation/amplification categories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      REGIMEN I: Patients receive veliparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-7 and&#xD;
      temozolomide PO once daily (QD) on days 1-5. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      REGIMEN II: Patients receive adavosertib PO BID for 5 doses starting on day 1 and carboplatin&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. (No longer an active study drug as of March&#xD;
      2018)&#xD;
&#xD;
      REGIMEN III: Patients receive everolimus PO QD on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. (No longer an active study drug&#xD;
      as of March 2018)&#xD;
&#xD;
      REGIMEN IV: Patients receive trametinib PO QD on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. (No longer an active study drug&#xD;
      as of March 2018)&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days. Patients with&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicities that have not resolved by day 30 are followed up biweekly until&#xD;
      stabilization or resolution.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  TUMOR BIOPSY SEQUENCING: Patients with gastrointestinal conditions that might&#xD;
             predispose for drug intolerability or poor drug absorption (e.g., inability to take&#xD;
             oral medication or a requirement for IV alimentation, prior surgical procedures&#xD;
             affecting absorption, malabsorption syndrome, and active peptic ulcer disease) are&#xD;
             excluded; subjects with Crohn's disease or a partial or complete small bowel&#xD;
             obstruction are also excluded, as are any patients who cannot swallow tablets or&#xD;
             capsules whole; tablets or capsules must not be crushed or chewed; nasogastric or&#xD;
             gastrostomy tube (G-tube) administration is not allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  TUMOR BIOPSY SEQUENCING: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on&#xD;
             combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for&#xD;
             pharmacokinetic (PK) interactions&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  TUMOR BIOPSY SEQUENCING: Patients who require use of coumarin-derivative&#xD;
             anticoagulants such as warfarin are excluded; low molecular weight heparin is&#xD;
             permitted for prophylactic or therapeutic use&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  TUMOR BIOPSY SEQUENCING: Patients who have previously been treated with the&#xD;
             combination of temozolomide plus a PARP inhibitor should not be considered eligible&#xD;
             for a biopsy given that these patients would not be eligible for the active veliparib&#xD;
             plus temozolomide arm&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  TREATMENT: Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  TREATMENT: Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents; patients on&#xD;
             other trials will be eligible as long as they are no longer receiving study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  TREATMENT: Patients with active brain metastases or carcinomatous meningitis are&#xD;
             excluded from this clinical trial; patients who have a history of seizures are not&#xD;
             eligible to receive veliparib&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  TREATMENT: Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited&#xD;
             to psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study&#xD;
             requirements, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, myocardial infarction in the past 6 months, invasive fungal infections, or&#xD;
             active (acute or chronic) or uncontrolled severe infection, liver disease such as&#xD;
             cirrhosis, decompensated liver disease, and active and chronic hepatitis (i.e.,&#xD;
             quantifiable HBV-DNA and/or positive HbsAg, quantifiable HCV-RNA) are not eligible to&#xD;
             participate; testing for hepatitis B or other infections for eligibility will be&#xD;
             performed only if clinically indicated&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  TREATMENT: Patients with gastrointestinal conditions that might predispose for drug&#xD;
             intolerability or poor drug absorption (e.g., inability to take oral medication or a&#xD;
             requirement for IV alimentation, prior surgical procedures affecting absorption,&#xD;
             malabsorption syndrome, and active peptic ulcer disease) are excluded; subjects with&#xD;
             Crohn's disease or a partial or complete small bowel obstruction are also excluded, as&#xD;
             are any patients who cannot swallow tablets or capsules whole; tablets or capsules&#xD;
             must not be crushed or chewed; nasogastric or G-tube administration is not allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  TREATMENT: HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible&#xD;
             because of the potential for PK interactions&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  TREATMENT: Eligibility of subjects receiving any medications or substances known to&#xD;
             affect or with the potential to affect the activity or pharmacokinetics (i.e.,&#xD;
             cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide 4 [CYP450], P-glycoprotein [PgP])&#xD;
             of any of the study drugs will be determined following review of their cases by the&#xD;
             principal investigator (PI); patients on strong and moderate cytochrome P450 system&#xD;
             inducers or inhibitors are ineligible; every effort would be made to switch patients&#xD;
             off medications that are known substrates of CYP450; if it is medically important for&#xD;
             the patient to remain on such medications, these patients can still be eligible to&#xD;
             participate based on PI discretion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  TREATMENT: Patients who require use of coumarin-derivative anticoagulants such as&#xD;
             warfarin are excluded; low molecular weight heparin is permitted for prophylactic or&#xD;
             therapeutic use&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  TREATMENT: Patients who have a history of another primary malignancy, with the&#xD;
             exceptions of: non-melanoma skin cancer, and carcinoma in situ of the cervix, uteri,&#xD;
             or breast from which the patient has been disease free for &gt; 3 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  TREATMENT: Patients with treatment-related acute myeloid leukemia (AML)&#xD;
             (t-AML)/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), or with features suggestive of AML/MDS, or who&#xD;
             have had prior allogeneic bone marrow transplant or double umbilical cord blood&#xD;
             transplantation, should not receive veliparib due to reports of MDS and leukemia&#xD;
             secondary to oncology therapy on Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP)-sponsored&#xD;
             studies utilizing veliparib&#xD;
