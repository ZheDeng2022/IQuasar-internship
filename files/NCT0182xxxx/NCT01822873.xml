    <textblock>
      The study hypothesis is that patients with dry age-related macular degeneration experience&#xD;
      visual function impairments such as defects in dark adaptation, glare intolerance, poor light&#xD;
      transition and reading in low lighting conditions. Studies have shown that patients in the&#xD;
      early phases of AMD with normal visual acuity commonly reported difficulty with these visual&#xD;
      functions but there have been no systematic studies evaluating these deficits in this&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective, exploratory study will include up to 130 patients with dry AMD and 60&#xD;
      controls. These patients will undergo the following non-invasive visual function testing:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  microperimetry with eye tracking&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  low luminance visual acuity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  specialized color vision (cone-specific)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  contrast testing and night vision testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High-resolution spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SDOCT) images will be taken of&#xD;
      the central retina using the Spectralis OCT unit. The values of visual function tested will&#xD;
      be correlated with the findings on SDOCT (volume/amount of drusen present in early AMD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no known risks to the subjects beyond what is normal for standard examinations of&#xD;
      the eye, visual function testing and standard ocular photographic procedures.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This prospective, exploratory study will be performed in multiple arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Arm 1: a pilot study of up to 40 patients (30 patients with dry age-related macular&#xD;
      degeneration and 10 normal age-matched controls) in order to test 1) the feasibility of&#xD;
      performing the visual function tests in this population and 2) test/retest reliability over&#xD;
      1-2 months. If the pilot study reveals that the visual function tests proposed are feasible&#xD;
      and have high reliability, the larger study (Phase 2) will be subsequently performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Arm 2: a study of up to 160 patients (130 dry AMD patients and 32 controls) with the goal&#xD;
      of evaluating the changes in visual function in dry AMD as compared to age-matched control&#xD;
      subjects. Study will include patients determined on examination have dry AMD as well as&#xD;
      age-matched normal control subjects without dry AMD. If two eyes satisfy the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria, both eyes will be tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After consent is obtained following full explanation of the research, subjects will undergo&#xD;
      the following non-invasive visual function testing: dark adaptation microperimetry with eye&#xD;
      tracking, specialized color vision (cone specific), contrast testing and night vision&#xD;
      testing. During the standard retina examination, color fundus photos will be taken using a&#xD;
      Zeiss camera. Fundus Autoflorescence (FA), macular pigment optical density (MPOD) based on&#xD;
      blue- green dual wave lenght FAF and high resolution spectral domain OCT(SDOCT) images will&#xD;
      be taken of the central retina using the Heidelberg Spectralis OCT unit. The values of visula&#xD;
      function tested will be correlated with the findings on SDOCT (volume/amount of drusen&#xD;
      present in dry AMD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During a testing day, the first patients first will undergo microperimetry testing, which&#xD;
      incorporates an eye tracker that operates independently of the microperimeter and is able to&#xD;
      compare results with a reference database of normal subjects. A Line Scanning Laser&#xD;
      Ophthalmoscope (SLO) is used to capture confocal images of the retina. Using the SLO image,&#xD;
      the operator can see the area to test. For follow-up examinations, the same area will be&#xD;
      tested and the machine generates a report on change from previous examination. The test takes&#xD;
      approximately 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will then undergo cone specific vision testing. The cone contrast test (CCT) is a&#xD;
      computer-based color test that rapidly identifies type (red, green, or blue) and severity&#xD;
      (mild, moderate, and severe) of color deficiency, quantifies color performance, and allows&#xD;
      early detection of acquired color deficiency. The automated test takes approximately 5&#xD;
      minutes to complete for all three cone tones; studies have shown impairment in blue and green&#xD;
      cones in AMD. The system also provides tests for low contrast sensitivity night vision&#xD;
      (simulate low lighting conditions, with darker background).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using computerized visual acuity charts, the patients will also be tested for day and night&#xD;
      glare and luminance. Using a dark adaptometer, the dark adaptation time will be measured.&#xD;
      Subjects will also complete a quality of life questionnaire (NEI VFQ) and a low luminance&#xD;
      questionnaire. The duration of each test can vary but typically lasts for 10-30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A tube of blood about 5 ml will be collected from about 160 willing participants anytime&#xD;
      during their study enrollment. The collected blood sample will be used for genetics studies&#xD;
      associated with AMD. The samples will be stored here at the Duke Eye Center until all needed&#xD;
      samples are obtained. All samples will be sent to Hoffman La Roche AG PDGE Functional&#xD;
      Excellence, Biosample and Repository Management Evaluation of visual function impairments in&#xD;
      patients with early dry age-related macular degeneration Basel, Switzerland for genetic&#xD;
      testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visual function testing will be performed at different time points depending on the&#xD;
      Arm of the study: at 1-2 months for Arm 1 and approximately 6, 12, 18 and 24 months for Arm 2&#xD;
      using the same protocol, based on standard of care clinic visits.&#xD;
