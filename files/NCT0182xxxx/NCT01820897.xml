  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urinary tract infections (UTI) are the most common complications after kidney&#xD;
      transplantation. Most series have reported incidence between 20 to 50% during the first year.&#xD;
      In the most recent report from our center the incidence was 36.6% during the first 6 months&#xD;
      after transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical consequence in the graft survival and the association with immunological&#xD;
      rejection has not been well defined. Nevertheless, the association of UTI with high rate of&#xD;
      hospitalization and their costs are widely recognized. There is paucity of trials, specially&#xD;
      randomized and controlled, comparing antibiotic prophylaxis in this group of patients. In a&#xD;
      recently published metaanalysis Green et al. (Transpl Infect Dis. 2011 Oct;13(5):441-7) found&#xD;
      only 6 clinical trials well designed, the conclusion was that antibiotic prophylaxis reduced&#xD;
      the incidence of UTI and the risk of sepsis. Based in this information, the KDIGO guidelines&#xD;
      in transplantation recommend the prophylaxis for UTI with sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim&#xD;
      (SMT). Nevertheless, the rate of bacterial resistance to SMT has been reported above 50% in&#xD;
      almost all the series.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fosfomycin-trometamol (FT) is a wall antibiotic (piruvil-tranferase inhibitor) that has shown&#xD;
      a good bioavailability, especially in the urinary tract. It has shown a wide antibacterial&#xD;
      spectrum, but the important target seems to be enteric bacilli particularly Escherichia coli&#xD;
      (the most prevalent cause of UTI). FT has also shown a very good activity against E. coli&#xD;
      producer of Extended Spectrum Betalactamases. Recently, the rate of these multi-drug&#xD;
      resistant bacteria has increased in our center as evidence of worldwide distribution. In&#xD;
      addition, the rate of FT resistance has been stable during the last years (&lt;3%). This&#xD;
      phenomenon could be explained because of the properties of this antibiotic, the most&#xD;
      important one seems to be related with the unique mechanism of action and the lack to&#xD;
      propagate the mechanisms of resistance at least in E. coli. There is only one clinical trial&#xD;
      (randomized and controlled), which compared FT with placebo in UTI prophylaxis; 317 women&#xD;
      with recurrent UTI (three by year) were included. They found rates of 0.14 and 2.9&#xD;
      episodes/patient/year, respectively (p&lt;0.001). Furthermore, there was no FT resistance during&#xD;
      the follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that in the first six months after kidney transplantation, UTI prophylaxis&#xD;
      with FT will show greater efficacy in comparison with SMT. Considering the incidence of UTI&#xD;
      in our center (36.6%) and the rate of UTI in the unique trial of prophylaxis with FT (14%),&#xD;
      65 patients will be needed by group of treatment to demonstrate a difference of 22% in the&#xD;
      incidence of UTI, with a power of 80% and confidence level of 95%. The primary outcome is the&#xD;
      incidence and rate of UTI during the first six months after kidney transplantation. The&#xD;
      secondary outcomes are, the hospitalization rate, antibiotic resistance rate, rejections and&#xD;
      titer and number of de novo donor specific antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial to compare FT&#xD;
      with SMT in the efficacy and safety to prevent UTI during the first six months after kidney&#xD;
      transplantation. The investigators will include patients from two tertiary-care transplant&#xD;
      centers. Recruiting and the randomization will be carried out separately by center and gender&#xD;
      (because female patients have a greater risk of UTI). The medical visits will be scheduled&#xD;
      monthly and include general laboratory, urine culture and information gathering about&#xD;
      antibiotic side effects as well as adherence. Rejection rate and the number and titers of de&#xD;
      novo donor specific antibodies (secondary outcome) will be obtained according to the standard&#xD;
      of care of the institutional kidney transplantation follow up. These include kidney biopsy at&#xD;
      days 0 and 90 after transplantation, as well as determination of donor specific antibodies&#xD;
      after sixth months of follow up. Graft biopsy is also performed whenever graft dysfunction&#xD;
      exists in the absence of an identifiable cause (infection, urinary graft obstruction).&#xD;

    <description>All the patients in the pre transplant evaluation have determination of donor specific antibody. The behavior of number and titles of these antibodies will be compared with a new measure at the end of followup (six months). Nevertheless if the patient previously has suspected humoral rejection, this determination would be taken in this moment, because is a diagnosis criteria of humoral rejection.</description>
