  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is associated with high rates of cardiovascular events and&#xD;
      death. In addition, DKD is the major cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the United&#xD;
      States. The purpose of this study is to prevent progression of kidney disease among patients&#xD;
      with DKD and uncontrolled hypertension (HTN) using a tailored, telehealth intervention that&#xD;
      simultaneously address medication management and modifies multiple risk factors through a&#xD;
      combination of patient self-monitoring, behavioral therapies and education to optimize&#xD;
      adherence and self-efficacy. Additional goals are to improve control of cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease risk factors and reduce cardiovascular events and death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that patients with DKD and uncontrolled HTN who receive this intervention will&#xD;
      have less progression, or a smaller decrease in kidney function, after 3 years when compared&#xD;
      to the education control group.&#xD;

      A randomized, controlled trial to slow DKD progression:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Using an innovative telehealth approach that is potentially scalable with demonstrable&#xD;
           efficacy in reducing antecedents of kidney disease, including poor blood pressure,&#xD;
           glucose, and lipid control&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Enrolling demographically diverse patients from local primary care clinics to allow&#xD;
           applicability of our results to the general US population within existing delivery&#xD;
           systems; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Targeting patients with moderate DKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate between 45-90&#xD;
           ml/min/1.73m2 with evidence of diabetic nephropathy) and uncontrolled HTN (blood&#xD;
           pressure ≥140/90 mm Hg), accounting for about 20% of all patients with diabetes who&#xD;
           disproportionately suffer from end-stage renal disease (ESRD), cardiovascular events,&#xD;
           and death.&#xD;
