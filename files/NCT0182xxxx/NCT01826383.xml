      This study sets out to compare the effectiveness of a parent pain management coaching video&#xD;
      that is 5-minutes in length. The investigators will be comparing an active-video to a&#xD;
      placebo-video of equal length (and identical formatting). Participants will be 6 or 18 month&#xD;
      infants undergoing routine immunization. The investigators hypothesize the active video will&#xD;
      result in a lowering of infant pain expressed post-immunization (3 minutes) and the increase&#xD;
      in the parental use of distraction, physical comfort, and rocking.&#xD;

      Our goal is to determine if a video instructing parents on the principles of soothing their&#xD;
      infant following immunization will influence soothing behaviours exhibited by parents, and&#xD;
      pain reactivity and regulation in infants. We plan to present parents of young infants (6&#xD;
      months) and older infants (18 months) with either a Treatment Video instructing them on the&#xD;
      ABCD's (Assess Anxiety, Belly Breathe, Calm Close Cuddle, Distraction; Copyright R. Pillai&#xD;
      Riddell) of pain management or a Placebo Video with neutral information. There is very&#xD;
      minimal risk because our suggestions are based on what parents deemed 'sensitive' (in our&#xD;
      ongoing longitudinal study) were doing naturally i.e., without any intervention in their&#xD;
      day-to-day lives. Additionally, in a separate study, that already received ethics approval,&#xD;
      parents viewed these videos without any negative side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be adult parents from one of two clinics in the Greater Toronto Area who&#xD;
      bring their infant in for a routine immunization (12 or 18 months). In our cohort study&#xD;
      (where we simply videotape dyads in the clinic).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents will be asked to complete a brief questionnaire (Parent Information Sheet) entailing&#xD;
      basic demographic information and preimmunization ratings of their worry about their infant's&#xD;
      pain from the immunization. The parents will also be asked to complete the 18-item Brief&#xD;
      Symptom Inventory (BSI-18) and the Negative Affect subscale (IBQ-R Very short form), in&#xD;
      addition to demographic information. The parents will subsquently be asked to view a brief&#xD;
      video (Treatment or Placebo Video) discussing the ABCD's of pain management described above.&#xD;
      During the infant's routine immunization procedure the parents and infant will be videotaped&#xD;
      for approximately 10 minutes, and the parent will be asked a few brief questions post&#xD;
      immunization including ratings of their infant's pain from the immunization procedure and the&#xD;
      helpfulness of the video.&#xD;

    <description>Infant pain regulation was operationalized using The Modified Behaviour Pain Scale (MBPS), modified by Taddio et al. (1995) for use with infants during office procedures. The measure rates the severity of distress reflected in three types of infant pain behaviours: (1) facial expressions; (2) cry; and (3) body movements during 15-second epochs post-immunization (for 3 minutes). Infants are assigned a score from 0 to 3 (or 0 to 4 on the cry scale), with larger values indicating a more intense behavioural response (Total Range 0-10)</description>

    <time_frame>3 minutes post-last needle</time_frame>
    <description>The MAISD (Measure of Adult and Infant Soothing and Distress; Cohen et al., 2005) is a behavior observation scale that was developed to examine the discrete behaviors exhibited by parents during children's invasive medical procedures. Rather than attempting to examine all behaviors, only those that were viewed as being potentially impacted by the treatment video will be included. Thus, distraction, rocking, physical comfort were selected. Each behaviour is coded every 5 seconds for either presence or absence (0 or 1). Three separate scores will be derived for each behaviour (distraction, rocking, physical comfort).</description>
