      Study Objectives: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) diagnosis using simplified methods such as&#xD;
      home respiratory polygraphy (HRP) is only recommended in patients with a high pre-test&#xD;
      probability. The aim is to determine the diagnostic efficacy, therapeutic decision-making and&#xD;
      costs of OSA diagnosis using PSG or three consecutive studies of HRP in patients with&#xD;
      mild-moderate suspicion of sleep apnea or with co-morbidity that can mask OSA symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and Setting: Randomized, blinded, crossover study of three nights of HRP (3N-HRP) vs.&#xD;
      PSG. The diagnostic efficacy was evaluated with ROC curves. Therapeutic decisions to assess&#xD;
      concordance between the two different approaches were analyzed by sleep physicians and&#xD;
      respiratory physicians (staff and residents) using agreement level and kappa coefficient. The&#xD;
      costs of each diagnostic strategy were considered.&#xD;

      Study subjects The study population consisted of subjects who were referred to the sleep unit&#xD;
      of the Clínic Hospital, Barcelona, Spain, or the San Pedro de Alcantara Hospital, Cáceres,&#xD;
      Spain, with a mild-moderate clinical suspicion of OSA or with notorious co-morbidity that&#xD;
      induced frequent symptoms which mimicked those of OSA or could reduce sleep time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria were: a) Patients with snoring and/or some observed apneas during&#xD;
      sleep. b) Epworth scale less than 15. c) Subjects with notorious co-morbidity. d) Age between&#xD;
      18 and 75 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exclusion criteria were as follows: high suspicion of sleep apnea (heavy snoring,&#xD;
      breathing pauses and somnolence that makes social life or working difficult, without any&#xD;
      other causes of hypersomnia); diagnosis of OSA; severe heart disease or resistant systemic&#xD;
      hypertension; suspicion of non-apneic sleep disorders, such as narcolepsy, REM behavior&#xD;
      disorders, and restless leg syndrome; psychophysical disability that would impede the&#xD;
      application of the home polygraphy device or major co-morbidity (unstable heart disease,&#xD;
      unstable pulmonary disease or disabling stroke); and lack of informed consent for the&#xD;
      protocol approved by the ethics committees of the two centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol We compared 3N-HRP with laboratory-standard PSG in randomized patients who met the&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria. The subjects were studied on a random basis for one night&#xD;
      in a sleep lab (standard PSG) and for three consecutive nights with HRP. Once the first test&#xD;
      had started, the second test was scheduled for within the following two days. PSG and HRP&#xD;
      were scored separately and the technicians and physicians were blinded to any identifying&#xD;
      information about the patients, as well as to any previous results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements Clinical data: Gender, age, weight, height, body mass index (BMI), waist-hip&#xD;
      ratio, neck circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and alcohol intake measured&#xD;
      as ≤ 60 gr/day or &gt; 60 gr/day, and tobacco consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Co-morbidity: Notable cardiovascular, metabolic or lung diseases, as well as diagnosis of&#xD;
      insomnia, anxiety, depression, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, or psychiatric&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptoms related to OSA: Episodes of nocturnal choking, nocturia, morning headache, or&#xD;
      morning tiredness. These data were collected in four degrees of intensity (never, sometimes,&#xD;
      frequently, and always). Sleepiness was measured by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale and the&#xD;
      American Sleep Disorders Association Sleepiness Scale (ASDA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other questionnaires: a) FOSQ (Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire), which assesses&#xD;
      the impact of excessive sleepiness on multiple activities of everyday. b) Euroqol-5D (EQ-5D),&#xD;
      which is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep studies. Standard laboratory PSG (Somté PSG, Compumedics Limited 2006, Abbotsford,&#xD;
      Victoria, Australia) was performed according to the technical specifications of the American&#xD;
      Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM). The recorded variables were electroencephalogram (EEG),&#xD;
      with derivations F4-M1, C4-M1, and O2-M1; electro-oculogram (EOG); chin electromyogram (EMG);&#xD;
      leg electromyogram; electrocardiogram (ECG). Respiratory variables measured by linearized&#xD;
      nasal pressure prongs and oronasal thermal flow waveform; respiratory effort signals measured&#xD;
      by inductive bands that recorded rib-cage and abdominal movements; oxygen saturation; body&#xD;
      position and snoring. A type 3 portable sleep apnea testing was used to perform HRP&#xD;
      (Sleep&amp;Go, Bitmed, Sibel S.A. Barcelona, Spain). Recorded variables were: flow measured by&#xD;
      linearized nasal pressure prongs, thermal flow, body position, rib-cage and abdominal&#xD;
      movements measured by inductive bands, and oxygen saturation. After a detailed explanation of&#xD;
      the use of the HRP device (set-up and withdrawal) in the hospital setting, it was taken home&#xD;
      and returned by the patient after three home studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A valid PSG or HRP had at least 180 recorded minutes. Moreover, a valid HRP had to have at&#xD;
      least 3 hours of flow or bands and oximetry measurements for scoring. The periods that were&#xD;
      considered as &quot;awake&quot; because of erratic breathing were not considered for scoring. Mean&#xD;
      values were obtained for the three nights of HRP. If one study was considered not to be&#xD;
      valid, this was removed and the mean values were obtained from the other two nights with HRP.&#xD;
      If two studies in the same patient were considered not to be valid, the patient was excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PSG and HRP were scored manually, separately, and blinded by independent technicians.&#xD;
      Sleep staging was performed using the standardized AASM criteria. The respiratory variables&#xD;
      obtained from HRP and PSG were scored according to the AASM criteria: apnea defined as a drop&#xD;
      in the peak signal excursion of ≈90% from the pre-event baseline with a duration ≥ 10&#xD;
      seconds; and hypopnea defined as a discernible reduction in the amplitude of the airflow&#xD;
      signal (≈30% of pre-event baseline) of at least 10 seconds of duration, associated with an&#xD;
      arousal and/or ≥ 3% oxygen desaturation from the pre-event baseline. For HRP, hypopnea was&#xD;
      defined as a discernible reduction in the amplitude of the airflow signal (≈30% of pre-event&#xD;
      baseline) of at least 10 seconds of duration, associated with ≥ 3% oxygen desaturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapeutic decision-making In addition to the real treatment decision of the physicians from&#xD;
      the two sleep units, other 15 reviewers (five sleep medicine specialists; five respiratory&#xD;
      physicians; and five respiratory resident physicians who had been trained for at least 3&#xD;
      months in a sleep lab) from other 5 sleep laboratories in Spain, via a website showing&#xD;
      clinical data from the patients and data from the sleep studies, take the therapeutic&#xD;
      decisions. The reviewers chose one of two options: 1) CPAP treatment; 2) no CPAP&#xD;
      treatment/other therapeutic measures. Each patient was presented twice (with PSG or HRP&#xD;
      information), blinded and non-consecutively. The criteria for recommending CPAP were an AHI&#xD;
      between 5 and 30 with significant symptoms or consequences or an AHI ≥30, taking less into&#xD;
      account symptoms or consequences, according to the Spanish Sleep Network guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics It was estimated that, after accepting an alpha risk of 0.05 and beta risk of 0.2&#xD;
      in a two-sided test, 55 subjects were needed for a minimum difference in AHI of 7.0 units to&#xD;
      be recognized as statistically significant. The standard deviation was assumed to be 18. A&#xD;
      dropout rate of 5% was anticipated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes to be studied and statistical analysis The means of the data obtained from the&#xD;
      3N-HRP were compared with PSG data. Student's t-test and Bland-Altman plots were used to&#xD;
      determine the agreement of the AHI measurements obtained by PSG and HRP. ANOVA was used to&#xD;
      assess the variability between each of the nights of HRP. The efficacy of the diagnostic test&#xD;
      was evaluated using sensitivity and specificity; positive and negative likelihood ratios [LR&#xD;
      (+) and LR (-)]; and the percentage of patients with positive and negative diagnosis. The&#xD;
      post-test probability of obtaining a true positive when the test was positive or negative was&#xD;
      calculated, based on the pre-test probability (prevalence of the disease) and the positive&#xD;
      and negative LRs. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted for the mean of&#xD;
      the 3N-HRP with the different polysomnographic AHI cut-off points (≥5, ≥10, ≥15, ≥ 30) for&#xD;
      OSA diagnosis to determine the best ROC curve based on area under the curve (AUC)&#xD;
      measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapeutic decision making The reviewers were grouped as sleep medicine specialists,&#xD;
      respiratory medicine physicians and resident physicians. A median of the therapeutic&#xD;
      decisions of each group was obtained. Agreement level (100 minus the sum of false positives&#xD;
      and negatives) and Cohen's kappa coefficient was used to determine the agreement between&#xD;
      therapeutic decisions. All the analyses were developed with the &quot;Statistical Package for&#xD;
      Social Sciences&quot; (SPSS, 21.0 for Windows; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost analysis We considered the costs of the each diagnostic strategy in an analysis of two&#xD;
      equally effective alternatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test, patient and total costs for PSG and HRP The estimated test costs of PSG and HRP were&#xD;
      obtained from the financial department from the two hospitals involved. These costs included&#xD;
      the following: personnel involved, equipment depreciation, and fungible material. Patient&#xD;
      costs were estimated according to the average costs for each patient of traveling from home&#xD;
      to hospital and back by taxi. We considered a round trip to the hospital in the case of PSG&#xD;
      and two round trips to pick up and return the HRP device. To estimate the costs per patient,&#xD;
      the test and patient costs were divided by the number of patients with a valid recording. To&#xD;
      obtain the total costs of PSG and HRP we added up the test and patient costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test, patient and total costs for equal diagnostic efficacy for PSG and HRP For PSG, the test&#xD;
      cost for equal diagnostic efficacy was the sum of the test cost and the cost of repeated PSGs&#xD;
      due to invalid recordings. For HRP, the test cost for equal diagnostic efficacy was the sum&#xD;
      of the test cost and the following: the costs of PSG for patients with invalid HRP&#xD;
      recordings; the cost of PSG in patients with indeterminate diagnostic results (&quot;gray zone&quot;)&#xD;
      and false positive and false negative results. To calculate the patient costs for equal&#xD;
      diagnostic efficacy, we also considered the transport costs due to repetitions of tests. To&#xD;
      calculate the costs per patient, these costs were divided by the number of patients who&#xD;
      completed the trial. Total PSG and HRP costs for equal diagnostic efficacy were obtained by&#xD;
      adding up the test and patient costs.&#xD;
