    <textblock>
      When a limb is traumatically severed, pain perceived in the part of the body that no longer&#xD;
      exists often develops. This is called &quot;phantom limb&quot; pain, and is different from &quot;stump&quot;&#xD;
      pain, which is pain within the part of the limb that remains intact. Unfortunately, phantom&#xD;
      pain resolves in only 16% of people, with the rest experiencing this pain for the remainder&#xD;
      of the lives. There is currently no reliable treatment for phantom limb pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exact reason that phantom limb pain occurs is unclear, but when a nerve is cut-as happens&#xD;
      with a traumatic amputation-changes occur in the brain and spinal cord that actually worsen&#xD;
      with increasing phantom pain. These abnormal changes may often be corrected by putting local&#xD;
      anesthetic-termed a &quot;peripheral nerve block&quot;-on the injured nerve, keeping any &quot;bad signals&quot;&#xD;
      from reaching the brain, with resolution of the phantom limb pain. However, when the nerve&#xD;
      block ends after a few hours, the phantom pain returns. But, this demonstrates that the brain&#xD;
      abnormalities-and phantom pain-that occur with an amputation may be dependent upon the &quot;bad&quot;&#xD;
      signals being sent from the injured nerve(s), suggesting that a very long peripheral nerve&#xD;
      block-lasting many days rather than hours-may permanently reverse the abnormal changes in the&#xD;
      brain, and provide lasting relief from phantom pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until recently, extending a peripheral nerve block beyond 16 hours was unrealistic. However,&#xD;
      a treatment option called a &quot;continuous peripheral nerve block&quot; is now available. This&#xD;
      technique involves the placement of a tiny tube-smaller than a piece of spaghetti-through the&#xD;
      skin and next to the nerves supplying the amputated limb. The tiny tube may be placed with&#xD;
      minimal discomfort in about 15 minutes. Numbing medicine called local anesthetic is then&#xD;
      infused through the tube, blocking any signals that the injured nerve sends to the spinal&#xD;
      cord and brain. Using a small, portable infusion pump, this prolonged nerve block may be&#xD;
      provided in individuals' own homes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ultimate objective of the proposed research study is to determine if a 6-day continuous&#xD;
      peripheral nerve block provided at home is an effective treatment for persistent phantom limb&#xD;
      pain following a traumatic limb amputation. The primary hypothesis (what the researchers&#xD;
      predict) is that phantom limb pain intensity will be significantly decreased 4 weeks&#xD;
      following treatment with a 6-day continuous peripheral nerve block.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background. The combination of increased munitions force, use of improvised explosive&#xD;
      devices, and casualty survival rates has resulted in a dramatic increase in the percentage of&#xD;
      injured combat veterans living with a traumatic amputation. Of American Veteran amputees,&#xD;
      35-98% develop chronic, intractable pain perceived as being from the missing limb, a&#xD;
      phenomenon termed &quot;phantom limb pain.&quot; This pain resolves in only 16% of afflicted&#xD;
      individuals, and there is currently no reliable treatment. The etiology of phantom pain&#xD;
      remains unclear, but evidence suggests that severing a nerve provokes changes in the spinal&#xD;
      cord, thalamus, and cerebral cortex. When neural input from an amputated limb is blocked with&#xD;
      local anesthetic (a peripheral nerve block), cortical abnormalities and phantom pain&#xD;
      frequently resolve. However, when the single-injection nerve block resolves after a few&#xD;
      hours, the phantom pain returns. These findings demonstrate that cortical abnormalities and&#xD;
      phantom pain may be maintained from abnormal peripheral input, suggesting that a peripheral&#xD;
      nerve block of extended duration-lasting many days rather than hours-may permanently&#xD;
      reorganize cortical pain mapping, thus providing lasting relief from phantom pain. A&#xD;
      &quot;continuous peripheral nerve block&quot; (CPNB) involves the percutaneous insertion of a catheter&#xD;
      directly adjacent to the peripheral nerves supplying an affected limb. Local anesthetic&#xD;
      infused via the catheter(s) induces a completely insensate extremity for as long as desired&#xD;
      without any systemic side effects. Additionally, CPNB may be provided on an ambulatory basis&#xD;
      using a small, portable pump to infuse the local anesthetic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective. To determine if ambulatory CPNB is an effective treatment for intractable phantom&#xD;
      limb pain following a traumatic limb amputation. Previously-published small, uncontrolled&#xD;
      series describe patients immediately following surgical amputation whose phantom limb pain&#xD;
      dramatically decreased or completely resolved with CPNB. We have data from a randomized,&#xD;
      double-masked, placebo-controlled, crossover pilot study suggesting great promise treating&#xD;
      intractable phantom limb pain with ambulatory CPNB: participants (n=3) experienced no change&#xD;
      in their phantom pain following a 6-day infusion of normal saline; however, with a 6-day CPNB&#xD;
      of potent local anesthetic administered 4 months later, subjects (n=2; one patient returned&#xD;
      to duty before crossover infusion) experienced complete resolution of their phantom limb&#xD;
      pain. Within the 12-week follow-up period, one subject experienced no phantom pain&#xD;
      recurrence; and the other subject reported mild pain occurring once each week of just a small&#xD;
      fraction of his original pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims. The primary hypothesis is that phantom limb pain intensity will be&#xD;
      significantly decreased 4 weeks following an ambulatory CPNB (as measured by the Numeric&#xD;
      Rating Scale of the Brief Pain Inventory).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design. We propose a multicenter, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      simultaneous parallel and crossover, human-subjects clinical trial. We will include subjects&#xD;
      with an existing upper or lower amputation who experience phantom limb pain at least daily&#xD;
      for the previous 4 weeks. Catheter site(s) will be determined by amputation location.&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized to receive one of two study solutions in a double-masked manner:&#xD;
      either a local anesthetic (ropivacaine 0.5%) or placebo (normal saline). Catheters will be&#xD;
      removed after 6 days of at-home infusion. Although not required, each subject has the option&#xD;
      to return for the alternative treatment four weeks later (crossover infusion). The primary&#xD;
      endpoint will be the difference in average phantom pain intensity at baseline and 4 weeks&#xD;
      following the initial infusion as measured with the Numeric Rating Scale between treatment&#xD;
      groups for the initial infusion. Major secondary endpoints will involve intra- and&#xD;
      inter-subject comparisons of additional measures of pain and health-related quality-of-life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Impact. From 2001-2006, over 70% of all U.S. military casualties endured a major&#xD;
      limb injury, with an amputation rate of 28% within Operation Enduring Freedom alone. Previous&#xD;
      conflicts have left tens-of-thousands of United States Armed Forces Veterans with missing&#xD;
      limbs. CPNB are now relatively ubiquitous within the United States, but applied nearly&#xD;
      exclusively to provide acute post-injury/surgical analgesia. If the proposed study&#xD;
      demonstrates that ambulatory CPNB is a reliable treatment for intractable phantom limb pain,&#xD;
      the resulting impact in treating the consequences of traumatic amputation will be immediate&#xD;
      and profound, as healthcare providers within the United States Armed Forces and Veterans&#xD;
      Affairs Medical Centers already have expertise placing and managing perineural catheters.&#xD;
      Currently, CPNB is provided exclusively in the acute setting-to treat pain immediately&#xD;
      following a battlefield injury or surgery-and not chronic, intractable phantom limb pain.&#xD;
      However, because there is little technical difference in providing CPNB for acute versus&#xD;
      chronic pain, the thousands of U.S. Veterans and active duty personnel suffering from&#xD;
      intractable phantom pain could be treated relatively easily, rapidly, and with negligible&#xD;
      additional costs.&#xD;

    <description>Phantom pain will be assessed using a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) as part of the Brief Pain Inventory (short form), with the &quot;average&quot; pain score designated as the primary endpoint. In addition, average and worst residual limb pain NRS will be recorded separately from the phantom pain scores. The NRS is a highly-sensitive measure of pain intensity with numbers ranging from 0 to 10, with zero equivalent to no pain and 10 equivalent to the worst imaginable pain. These data are 4 weeks after the initiation of the FIRST intervention (and not the optional crossover treatment).</description>

          <description>Electronic, programmable, portable infusion pumps will be used to administer perineural study solution at fixed rates for over 6 days. Subjects will receive a total of 1,100 mL of study fluid from either one (upper extremity) or two (lower extremity) pump and external reservoir combinations. The continuous basal infusion rate will be determined by catheter location: femoral 2.5 mL/h; popliteal-sciatic 5 mL/h; and infraclavicular 7.5 mL/h (37.5 mg/h for both upper and lower extremity subjects). No patient-controlled bolus dose will be included. Subjects assigned this treatment for their initial infusion will have the option of returning 4-16 weeks later for a second infusion of the alternate treatment: normal saline.&#xD;

          <title>Depression as measured with the Beck's Depression Inventory</title>
          <description>The Beck Depression Inventory is a 21-item instrument that measures characteristic symptoms and signs of depression, requires only a 5th grade comprehension level to adequately understand the questions, and demonstrates a high internal consistency (0.73-0.92, mean of 0.86), reliability and validity. Each of the 21 factors is rated on a 0-3 scale, and then summed to produce the total score of 0-63. Mild, moderate, and severe depression is defined with scores of 10-18, 19-29, and 30-63, respectively.</description>

        <description>The Brief Pain Inventory (interference sub scale) is an instrument that measures the interference with physical and emotional functioning using a 0-10 scale (0 = no interference; 10 = complete interference). The seven interference questions involve general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work activities (both inside and outside of the home), relationships, sleep, and enjoyment of life.

Each of the 21 factors is rated on a 0-3 scale, and then summed to produce the total score of 0-63. Mild, moderate, and severe depression is defined with scores of 10-18, 19-29, and 30-63, respectively.

        <title>Change in Depression 6 and 12 Months Compared With Baseline (as Measured With the Beck Depression Inventory).</title>
        <description>The Beck Depression Inventory is a 21-item instrument that measures characteristic symptoms and signs of depression, requires only a 5th grade comprehension level to adequately understand the questions, and demonstrates a high internal consistency (0.73-0.92, mean of 0.86), reliability and validity. Each of the 21 factors is rated on a 0-3 scale, and then summed to produce the total score of 0-63. Mild, moderate, and severe depression is defined with scores of 10-18, 19-29, and 30-63, respectively. The data presented are the Beck Depression Inventory at 6 and 12 months compared with baseline.</description>
        <time_frame>6 and 12 months following initiation of the initial intervention</time_frame>
        <population>All subjects received the initial intervention. However, only a subset of each group chose to participate in the optional crossover treatment that occurred 1-4 months following the initiation of the initial treatment infusion. For those who did participate in the optional crossover treatment, they received the alternative treatment as their initial treatment (e.g., subjects who initially received placebo saline subsequently received Ropivacaine 0.5%, and vice versa).</population>

        <title>Perception of Well-being (as Measured With the Patient Global Impression of Change Scale).</title>
        <description>The Patient Global Impression of Change Scale is a 7-point ordinal scale requiring the subject to rate the current severity of their global situation as it relates to phantom limb pain (as defined by each individual) compared to their baseline. This scale has the words &quot;very much worse&quot; to the left by the number one, and &quot;very much improved&quot; to the right, adjacent to the number seven. The words &quot;no change&quot; are in the middle of the scale above the number four. The Patient Global Impression of Change Scale has been validated in over ten prospective trials, including studies specifically involving peripheral neuropathy.</description>

          <title>Ropivacaine 0.5%</title>
          <description>Electronic, programmable, portable infusion pumps will be used to administer perineural study solution at fixed rates for over 6 days. Subjects will receive a total of 1,100 mL of study fluid from either one (upper extremity) or two (lower extremity) pump and external reservoir combinations. The continuous basal infusion rate will be determined by catheter location: femoral 2.5 mL/h; popliteal-sciatic 5 mL/h; and infraclavicular 7.5 mL/h (37.5 mg/h for both upper and lower extremity subjects). No patient-controlled bolus dose will be included. This group includes subjects who received the ropivacaine infusion either as the initial treatment or crossover treatment.</description>
