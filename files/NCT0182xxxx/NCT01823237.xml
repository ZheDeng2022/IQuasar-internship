    <textblock>
      Dystonia is a disease where muscles in the affected body part are abnormally active. This may&#xD;
      result in abnormal postures. The underlying mechanisms are not known. One proposed mechanism&#xD;
      is located in the motor area of the brain that controls the coordination of muscles, called&#xD;
      the motor cortex. It is well known that the motor area of one hemisphere of the brain (motor&#xD;
      cortex) controls the movement of the opposite side of the body. When people perform tasks&#xD;
      such as picking up an object or writing there are mechanisms in motor cortex that focus the&#xD;
      level of activity so that they can do these tasks with a high level of precision. Focusing&#xD;
      activity in motor cortex seems to be disturbed in people with dystonia. Transcranial magnetic&#xD;
      stimulation (TMS) is a device that allows the non-invasive stimulation of the brain. When&#xD;
      applied to the motor cortex it can upregulate or down regulate its activity. In the present&#xD;
      study the investigators will conduct experiments on subjects with task specific focal hand&#xD;
      dystonia (such as writers cramp) using TMS to decrease unwanted motor activity. The&#xD;
      investigators will assess the effects of this intervention using objective, subjective and&#xD;
      kinematic measures. This is a pilot study and will require further research to assess the&#xD;
      long-term effects of repetitive TMS on task-specific focal hand dystonia.&#xD;
