  <brief_title>A Fixed Dose Combination Amlodipine + Enalapril Bioavailability Study</brief_title>
  <official_title>An Open-Label, Randomized, Single Dose, Two-Way Crossover Pilot Study to Evaluate the Relative Bioavailability of One Amlodipine 5 mg Tablet and One Enalapril Maleate 20mg Tablet to a Fixed Dose Combination Tablet Formulation of Amlodipine (5 mg) and Enalapril Maleate (20 mg), in Healthy Adult Male and Female Subjects Under Fasting Conditions</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to estimate the bioavailability of amlodipine and enalapril maleate&#xD;
      fixed dose combination (FDC) relative to co-administration of amlodipine and enalapril&#xD;
      maleate tablets. The rational for this study is to provide a more convenient dosing regimen&#xD;
      for patients. This is an open-label, randomized, single dose, two-way crossover study, in&#xD;
      which 16 healthy adult male and female subjects will be enrolled and dosed under fasting&#xD;
      conditions. Each subject will participate in two treatment periods of 7 days each. There will&#xD;
      be at least 14 days of wash out period between the two dosing periods and a follow-up period&#xD;
      of up to 21 days after treatment period 2. The total duration of study will be approximately&#xD;
      35 days from the start of the first treatment.&#xD;
