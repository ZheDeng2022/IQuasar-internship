  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glucose control is necessary to avoid the immediate and long-term adverse effects associated&#xD;
      with type 1 diabetes, and frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose is the first important&#xD;
      step to achieving glucose control. Data suggest that large proportions of adolescents and&#xD;
      young adults fail to adhere to standard guidelines of self-monitored of blood glucose testing&#xD;
      and have hemoglobin A1c levels &gt;7.5%. A finite period of poor metabolic control can lead to&#xD;
      increased risk of medical complications over an individual's lifespan, necessitating novel&#xD;
      interventions to improve self-monitored blood glucose testing and metabolic control in&#xD;
      emerging adults with type 1 diabetes. The investigators treatment approach, which provides&#xD;
      direct tangible reinforcement for objective evidence of behavior change, is efficacious in&#xD;
      decreasing substance use, reducing weight, and improving medication adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this project is to develop and pilot test an intervention based on behavioral&#xD;
      economic principles for improving self-monitored blood glucose testing in young persons with&#xD;
      type 1 diabetes. In this pilot study, patients will text in, via cell phones, each time they&#xD;
      test, and a return text will inform them of reinforcer vouchers earned. The investigators&#xD;
      will collect data on self-monitored blood glucose testing frequency and A1c levels preceding&#xD;
      treatment initiation and throughout a 6 month treatment period. If promising, a randomized&#xD;
      trial will lead to larger scale evaluations of reinforcement interventions alone, or in&#xD;
      combination with multimodal treatment approaches, and it may be applied to other clinical&#xD;
      issues such as adherence to continuous glucose monitoring. Importantly, this intervention can&#xD;
      be administered remotely and in an automated fashion, allowing for widespread adoption if&#xD;
      efficacious.&#xD;
