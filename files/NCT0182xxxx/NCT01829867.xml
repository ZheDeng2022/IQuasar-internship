    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has a diagnosis of idiopathic PD&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous participation in study sNN0031-001 with completion of 12 study weeks without&#xD;
             development of clinically significant safety concerns defined as being any&#xD;
             drug-related or device related SAE that resulted in premature termination of treatment&#xD;
             or a medical device incident that could not be resolved during the conduct of study&#xD;
             sNN0031-001 and sNN0031-002&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inclusion in study sNN0031-002 and participation without development of clinically&#xD;
             significant safety concerns defined as being device related SAE that resulted in&#xD;
             premature termination or a medical device incident that could not be resolved during&#xD;
             the conduct of study sNN0031-002&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intact continuity of the SynchroMed® II pump and ICV-catheter infusion system as&#xD;
             judged by X-ray of head and abdominal area&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An ICV catheter tip position that is similar to the catheter tip position at&#xD;
             implantation in study sNN0031-001, as verified with an MRI not older than 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Verification of device function made as a comparison of pump actual residual volume to&#xD;
             the anticipated residual volume as indicated by the programmer. Reference point will&#xD;
             be the refill volume and programming of the pump made at first visit with saline&#xD;
             refill in study sNN0031-002. Values within 25% of expected will be an indication that&#xD;
             the pump is functioning properly&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ophthalmologic examination with no clinically significant findings that imply safety&#xD;
             concerns for this study such as retinal haemorrhage, signs for papillary oedema&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females should either be post-menopausal (at least 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea&#xD;
             or 6 months of spontaneous amenorrhoea with follicle stimulating hormone levels &gt;40&#xD;
             mIU/mL), be surgically sterilised (bilateral oophorectomy without hysterectomy), or&#xD;
             use adequate contraception (oral contraceptives, intrauterine device or double barrier&#xD;
             contraception, i.e., condom + diaphragm, condom or diaphragm + spermicidal gel or&#xD;
             foam) during the duration of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient, with or without the help of a caregiver, must be capable of maintaining&#xD;
             an accurate and complete symptom diary and to adhere to visit schedules&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has been given written and verbal information about the study, has had the&#xD;
             opportunity to ask questions about the study, and understands the time and procedural&#xD;
             commitments&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has provided written informed consent to participate in the study before&#xD;
             any study-specific procedures are conducted&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in another clinical study that entails investigational drug or device&#xD;
             treatment after participation in study sNN0031-001 or study sNN0031-002&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has, since participation in study sNN0031-001, had functional&#xD;
             neurosurgical treatment for PD (e.g., deep brain stimulation)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent dementia with a score of 20 or lower on the MoCA-test&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent clinically significant depression with a score of 16 or higher on the MADRS&#xD;
             rating scale, equivalent to moderate or severe depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exposure to neuroleptic drugs blocking dopamine receptors within 6 months from the&#xD;
             baseline visit of this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of structural brain disease including tumours and hyperplasia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ongoing or suspected primary or recurrent malignant disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of increased intracranial pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled hypertension with blood pressure &gt;160 mmHg systolic or &gt;90 mmHg&#xD;
             diastolic.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Completion of an MRI examination of the brain and cervical spinal cord within 3 months&#xD;
             prior to study start with finding of tumours or potential sources of pathological&#xD;
             bleedings, or abnormality that may or would interfere with the assessments of safety&#xD;
             or efficacy, in the judgment of the Investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of cardiac pacemakers, spinal cord stimulators, implantable programmable&#xD;
             intraspinal drug pumps, or any other device that may interfere or interact with the&#xD;
             programmer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant abnormalities in haematology or clinical chemistry parameters&#xD;
             indicative of a medical condition requiring treatment which, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator, is not compatible with participation in the present study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ongoing medical condition that according to the Investigator would interfere with the&#xD;
             conduct and assessments in the study. Examples are medical disability (e.g., severe&#xD;
             degenerative arthritis, compromised nutritional state, peripheral neuropathy) that&#xD;
             would interfere with the assessment of safety and efficacy of investigational product&#xD;
             or device performance, or would compromise the ability of the patient to undergo study&#xD;
             procedures (e.g., MRI), to maintain a patient diary or to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serological evidence of HBV, HCV or HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;

             urine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Increased susceptibility to infections (e.g. malignancies, neutropenia,&#xD;
             immunodeficient states, immunosuppressive therapy).&#xD;
