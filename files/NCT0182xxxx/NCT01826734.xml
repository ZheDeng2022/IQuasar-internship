      Background Because dacryoliths occur at low frequency, few studies have focused on their&#xD;
      composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aimed to present findings from morphological, chemical, and mineralogic&#xD;
      analysis of 86 dacryoliths.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods The team studied 86 dacryoliths obtained during 832 dacryocystorhinostomies (DCR)&#xD;
      performed for postsaccal obstruction. The samples were analyzed with atomic infrared&#xD;
      spectrometry (80 samples), amino acid analysis (17 samples), scanning electron microscopy,&#xD;
      and an electron microprobe with an energy dispersive detector (7 samples).&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION It is not unusual to find a stone in the lacrimal sac during&#xD;
      dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR). Although patients with dacryolithiasis often have a history of&#xD;
      long-term intermittent epiphora, lacrimal sac distention, and/or partial obstruction of the&#xD;
      nasolacrimal duct (NLD), dacryoliths are often only detected during DCR. The incidence of&#xD;
      dacryoliths in the lacrimal sac of patients that undergo DCR ranges from 6.0-18.0%; however,&#xD;
      the incidence of dacryoliths has not been evaluated in the general population. Unfortunately,&#xD;
      most published studies on dacryoliths have included quite a small number of samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Canalicular concretions have long been associated with canaliculitis caused by actinomycotic&#xD;
      infection. However, despite recent, significant progress, an understanding of the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of lacrimal sac dacryoliths is still missing. Several predisposing factors&#xD;
      have been suggested to contribute to the mechanism that gives rise to dacryolith formation.&#xD;
      These factors include age (under 50 years old), sex (increased frequency in females),&#xD;
      cigarette smoking, and previous occurrence of chronic dacryocystitis and primary acquired&#xD;
      nasolacrimal duct obstruction (PANDO). Recent analyses have shown that dacryolith development&#xD;
      may be related to lacrimal sac epithelial and NLD production of a broad spectrum of mucins&#xD;
      and expression of two peptide members of the trefoil factor family (TFF), TFF1 and TFF3.&#xD;
      Because dacryoliths occur at low frequency, few studies have focused on their composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the authors aimed to present findings from morphological, chemical, and&#xD;
      mineralogic analysis of 86 dacryoliths.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 967 primary EDCRs were performed at the Department of&#xD;
      Otorhinolaryngology of the University Hospital of Ostrava and at the Department of&#xD;
      Otorhinolaryngology of the Frydek-Mistek City Hospital between 1994 and April 2012. Only&#xD;
      EDCRs performed for postsaccal stenosis/obstruction (832 procedures) were included in the&#xD;
      study. Exclusion criteria were presaccal obstruction treatment, revision EDCRs, and&#xD;
      incomplete follow-ups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, Good Clinical&#xD;
      Practice, and applicable regulatory requirements. Written consent was obtained from all&#xD;
      patients before the initiation of surgery and dacryolith analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the group of 832 EDCRs, 86 stones of the lacrimal sac (dacryoliths) were found,&#xD;
      including 61/86 (70.9%) in women and 25/86 (29.1%) in men. Clinical information was obtained&#xD;
      from patient medical records, including the involved side, the etiology of the nasolacrimal&#xD;
      duct (NLD) obstruction, the outcome of EDCR at one year after surgery, the size of the&#xD;
      dacryolith, and data from dacryolith analysis. The investigators also performed infrared&#xD;
      spectrometry, amino acid analysis, and imaging and morphological analyses with a scanning&#xD;
      electronic microscope. The association with cigarette smoking was not examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infrared spectroscopy The authors examined the dacryoliths with Fourier transform infrared&#xD;
      spectrometry (FTIR; IMPACT 410, fy Nicolet) and a tableting method with potassium bromide&#xD;
      (KBr). Evaluations were performed with OMNIC software, and the obtained spectra were compared&#xD;
      with a library of spectra from kidney stones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amino acids analysis Proteins in the samples (≤ 20 mg) were hydrolyzed with hydrochloric acid&#xD;
      [1,2]. Then, 1 mL of distilled water was added, the solution was filtered, then evaporated at&#xD;
      90 ºC under nitrogen, and the residue was dissolved in 2 mL of 1% aqueous NaOH. An aliquot&#xD;
      (~0.5 mg of the initial sample) was transferred to another tube, the volume adjusted to ± 100&#xD;
      µL with 1% NaOH, and a derivatization was performed with ethyl chloroformate (4). Next, gas&#xD;
      chromatography in tandem with mass spectrometry with a 7890A and MSD5975C (Agilent) was&#xD;
      performed, equipped with a 30-m, VF-17ms capillary column (0.25 mm × 0.15 μm; CP8981 from&#xD;
      HPST, Praque). Samples were run at temperatures ramped from 60 to 300 ºC at a rate of 6 ºC&#xD;
      /min; split injection (10:1) was employed. Electron impact (EI) mass spectrometry detection&#xD;
      at 70 eV was performed at temperatures of 230 ºC for the ion source, 250 ºC for the transfer&#xD;
      line, and 150 ºC for the quad. We performed full-scan analyses with a helium-carrier gas flow&#xD;
      of 1.2 mL/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging and morphological analysis Morphological analyses were performed with a scanning&#xD;
      electron microscope (QUANTA FEG 450, FEI Company, WA, USA). An electron microprobe with an&#xD;
      energy dispersive detector (EDS) was used for the elemental analysis of the organic matrix of&#xD;
      the stone and for the analysis of fine inorganic particulates in the stone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis For statistical analysis, binomial confidence intervals (CI) for the&#xD;
      success rates at the 95% CI were calculated. The two-sample t-test and X2 test were used to&#xD;
      evaluate differences in age, sex, and surgical success between groups I and II; p&lt;0.05 was&#xD;
      considered statistically significant.&#xD;
