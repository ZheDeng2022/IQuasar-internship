      Erythropoietin, EPO, is the main regulator and stimulator of bone marrow erythropoiesis, and&#xD;
      is responsible for growth and differentiation of the erythroid cell lineage. Our team, in&#xD;
      collaboration with partners (see below) has taken responsibility to study the presence,&#xD;
      function and clinical significance of EPO-R in human cancer specimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Aim of the Proposed Project: To study EPO-R in human cancer specimens. Prepared&#xD;
      slides from already taken preparations (specimens from Bone Marrow tests) will serve as the&#xD;
      basis for that part of the work.Specimens will be taken from Breast cancer, Colon cancer,&#xD;
      Lung cancer, Head &amp; Neck cancer and from Lymph nodes biopsy (positive for lymphoma) The&#xD;

      Background: Erythropoietin, EPO, is the main regulator and stimulator of bone marrow&#xD;
      erythropoiesis, and is responsible for growth and differentiation of the erythroid cell&#xD;
      lineage. The cloning of the gene, led to the production of the recombinant product, rHuEPO.&#xD;
      rHuEPO has successfully served over the last couple of decades for both research and clinical&#xD;
      application. The product has been shown to improve the anemia of end-stage renal disease,&#xD;
      cancer-related anemia, as well as other types of anemia and/or blood loss. Improved anemia by&#xD;
      rHuEPO is characterized by increased hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit (Hct) levels, reduced&#xD;
      blood transfusion requirements and an improved quality of life. Thus, the use of rHuEPO has&#xD;
      become a routine daily practice in hematology and oncology, with millions of cancer patients&#xD;
      with or without anemia treated with rHuEPO. Indeed, rHuEPO has become a blockbuster (over an&#xD;
      annual billion dollar sales) and the most common biological product in the market.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2003, reports have suggested that breast cancer, and Head and Neck cancer patients,&#xD;
      treated with rHuEPO had a shorter survival than patients who had not been treated with the&#xD;
      hormone. These reports were followed by several others. However, other reports, including&#xD;
      ours, led to different conclusions. Meta-analysis also failed to provide a definitive answer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three potential mechanisms, none of them proven so far, have been proposed to explain&#xD;
      potential poor prognosis among rHuEPO-treated cancer patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Stimulation of EPO receptors (EPO-R), existing on the surface of the tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. High level of Hb and Hct, leading to viscosity and thrombotic-like complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Increased angiogenesis induced by rHuEPO promoting tumor progression. As expected, these&#xD;
           conflicting reports elicited a controversy among the clinical hematologic-oncologic&#xD;
           communities, reduced the use of the product and led the FDA Oncology Drug Advisory&#xD;
           Committee (ODAC) to publish an alert. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)&#xD;
           and the American Society of Hematology (ASH), as well as the European Organization for&#xD;
           Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), published strict guidelines, defining who are&#xD;
           the patients and under what circumstances rHuEPO should be or should not be&#xD;
           administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With our long-time collaborator, Prof. D. Neumann, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, TAU, we have&#xD;
      established a European international consortium, with top basic scientists and clinical&#xD;
      investigators, with the general aim to study the topic further. Recently, the consortium, led&#xD;
      by Prof. Neumann has been notified that the EU has recognised the importance of the project&#xD;
      and has decided to fund it with the prestigious FP7 research grant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our team, in collaboration with partners (see below) has taken responsibility to study the&#xD;
      presence, function and clinical significance of EPO-R in human cancer specimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Aim of the Proposed Project: To study EPO-R in human cancer specimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To detect EPO-R on tumor cells To test the EPO-R function To follow the patients and study&#xD;
      the possible correlation between the presence and function of EPO-R on the tumor specimens&#xD;
      and the clinical outcome and prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Retrospective Project:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (A waiver for informed consent will be requested from January 1990 till December 2011)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prepared slides from already taken preparations (specimens) will serve as the basis for&#xD;
           that part of the work.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  When required, additional slides from the pathological &quot;block&quot; will be prepared.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The required specimens:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Breast cancer - 50 (from 50 patients)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Colon cancer - 50&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Lung cancer - 50&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Head &amp; Neck cancer - 50&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Lymph nodes biopsy (positive for lymphoma) - 50 The samples of cancer tissues from&#xD;
                bronchoscopy, endoscopy and FNA/FNB, where there is only a small amount of tissue,&#xD;
                will not be used for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The unstained, non-identified, slides will be transferred to Prof. Drorit Neumann's&#xD;
           laboratory, at the Sackler Faculty of medicine, where analysis of the slides for EPO-R&#xD;
           content will be performed. Part of these slides will be transferred to Queens&#xD;
           University, Belfast, Ireland and the same tests will be performed in the lab of prof.&#xD;
           Makswell.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The slides will be stained with anti-EPO-R antibodies (Abs). These Abs will be generated&#xD;
           as a part of the European EPO-CAN project by Dr. John Thompson and his team in Aldevron,&#xD;
           Freiburg, Germany.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In order to prepare formalin-fixed paraffin wax-embedded (FFPE) material, tissue samples&#xD;
           are fixed in 10% buffered formalin overnight at room temperature and processed through&#xD;
           graded alcohols to paraffin wax. Once embedded, 3-5µm sections are cut onto activated&#xD;
           slides and placed in a 37°C incubator overnight. These are ready for&#xD;
           immunohistochemistry. This is our standard methodology for single sections. For Tissue&#xD;
           Microarrays (TMAs) selected cases are identified and regions of interest marked using&#xD;
           haematoxylin and eosin stained slides. The regions are cored from their original blocks&#xD;
           and re-embedded according to an established map. Between 50 and 100 cores are sited per&#xD;
           block. Serial 3-5µm sections are cut from these and are treated as above. Screening and&#xD;
           staining parameter optimisation of the antibodies are performed on single section&#xD;
           preparations. Selected antibodies suitable for FFPE material are used to stain TMAs of&#xD;
           normal and malignant tissues from a range of tumours, prepared in the Northern Ireland&#xD;
           Biobank.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note: The information collection from the samples will be conducted by anonymous technique&#xD;
      and will be separated in irreversible way from the patient's identification details.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Prospective Project:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Patient informed consent is required)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A similar work will be performed but on fresh material samples, that will be taken from&#xD;
           biopsies in the operating room.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be identified, with a 2-3 year follow-up on the clinical course and an&#xD;
           attempt to correlate the course and clinical outcome with the presence and function of&#xD;
           the EPO-R on the tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only a small (tiny) piece of patient tissue will required. Thus, it should not interfere with&#xD;
      any other activity or assay required for decision making process for the patient. There will&#xD;
      remained enough patient tissue in storage for future medicine tests for therapeutic goals.&#xD;
