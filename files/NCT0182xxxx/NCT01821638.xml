  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive impairment, commonly reported as difficulty with memory and executive function, is&#xD;
      a widely recognized clinical challenge for older persons with heart failure (HF). Little is&#xD;
      known about the relationship between brain MRI and cognitive impairment in older persons with&#xD;
      HF. A limited number of studies have investigated brain MRI in adults with HF and produced&#xD;
      conflicting results. Previous findings are limited by use of lower resolution scanners (1.5&#xD;
      Tesla), lack of MRI techniques (i.e. combining structural sequences with perfusion sequences)&#xD;
      and recruitment of mixed age samples. Based on these limitations, the purpose of this&#xD;
      research plan is to explore the relationship between brain MRI and cognitive impairment in&#xD;
      older persons with HF using high resolution structural and perfusion scans. To accomplish&#xD;
      this goal, investigators will compare 40 adults with HF who are age &gt; 65 years old with 40&#xD;
      healthy, gender, age, and education matched controls. Investigators will obtain&#xD;
      neuropsychological measures of multiple domains, as well as MRI measurements of the temporal&#xD;
      lobe and prefrontal cortex at baseline and 12-months.&#xD;

      Cognitive impairment, commonly reported as difficulty with memory and executive function, is&#xD;
      a widely recognized clinical challenge for persons &gt; 65 years old with HF. Although the&#xD;
      degree of cognitive impairment usually does not meet the criteria for dementia, it can affect&#xD;
      an individual's ability to process and remember information, such as complex medication&#xD;
      regimens [5]. Findings suggest that brain regions that support memory (i.e. temporal lobe)&#xD;
      and executive function (i.e. prefrontal cortex) may be altered in older persons with HF;&#xD;
      suggesting that these brain alterations are related to the HF disease process and not normal&#xD;
      aging. Surprisingly, despite the high prevalence of cognitive impairment in HF, relationships&#xD;
      between brain and cognition have not been well studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Little is known about the relationships between brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and&#xD;
      cognitive impairment in older persons with HF. A limited number of studies have investigated&#xD;
      brain MRI in adults with HF and produced conflicting results. Three studies utilized&#xD;
      structural MRI techniques and identified evidence of atrophy in the temporal lobe,&#xD;
      hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex and an increased volume of white matter hyperintensities&#xD;
      [6-8]. Brain hypoperfusion, operationalized as decreased global cerebral perfusion, was&#xD;
      identified in two studies [9, 10]. Only one study examined relationships between brain MRI&#xD;
      and cognitive impairment in HF [6]. Vogels et al., (2007) found that atrophy in the medial&#xD;
      temporal lobe was associated with decreased measures of memory and executive function. White&#xD;
      matter hyperintensities did not correlate with any cognitive measures. Limited research&#xD;
      findings indicate that various brain alterations in the temporal lobe, hippocampus, and&#xD;
      prefrontal cortex contribute to cognitive impairment in HF. However, previous findings are&#xD;
      limited by use of lower resolution scanners (1.5 Tesla), lack of MRI techniques (i.e.&#xD;
      structural and perfusion scans) and recruitment of mixed age samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these limitations, the purpose of this research plan is to explore relationships&#xD;
      between brain MRI and cognitive impairment in older persons with HF using high resolution&#xD;
      structural and perfusion scans. To accomplish this goal, investigators will compare 40 adults&#xD;
      with HF who are &gt; 65 years old with 40 healthy, gender, age, and education matched controls.&#xD;
      Investigators will obtain neuropsychological measures of multiple domains, as well as MRI&#xD;
      measurements of the temporal lobe and prefrontal cortex at baseline and 12-months. The&#xD;
      following specific aims will be investigated:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Compare brain MRI in older persons with HF and controls at baseline and 12-months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1a: Older persons with HF will have increased white matter hyperintensities,&#xD;
      decreased grey matter volume, and decreased perfusion in the temporal lobe and prefrontal&#xD;
      cortex compared with controls. Hypothesis 1b: Older persons with HF will exhibit a greater&#xD;
      decline in grey matter volume in the temporal lobe and prefrontal cortex over 12-months&#xD;
      compared with controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Compare cognitive function in older persons with HF and controls at baseline and&#xD;
      12-months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2a): Older persons with HF will perform lower on measures of memory and executive&#xD;
      function compared with controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2b): Older persons with HF will exhibit a greater decline on measures of memory&#xD;
      and executive function over 12-months compared with controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Examine the relationships between brain MRI and cognitive function in older persons&#xD;
      with HF and controls at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3a: Decreased grey matter and perfusion in the temporal lobe and an increased&#xD;
      volume of white matter hyperintensities in the temporal lobe will be associated with&#xD;
      decreased memory scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3b: Decreased grey matter and perfusion in the prefrontal cortex and an increased&#xD;
      volume of white matter hyperintensities in the prefrontal cortex will be associated with a&#xD;
      decreased executive function score.&#xD;
