    <textblock>
      The Attention Deficit Disorder with or without Hyperactivity (ADHD) is one of the most&#xD;
      frequently found disorder in children. It is characterized by a triad of symptoms involving&#xD;
      attention deficit, hyperactivity and impulsivity and having an impact on the functioning of&#xD;
      the subject especially in terms of learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, main interventions to treat ADHD in children are stimulant medication or&#xD;
      supportive psychotherapy. Data from recent studies highlight the use of stimulant drugs&#xD;
      (amphetamine derivatives such as methylphenidate) to treat the core symptoms of ADHD&#xD;
      children. These drugs are generally effective but their nature (psychostimulants) and adverse&#xD;
      effects they cause (appetite suppression, sleep disturbances, headaches, motor tics,&#xD;
      abdominal pain, irritability, nausea and fatigue) encourage the development of new&#xD;
      therapeutic approaches. The use of supportive psychotherapy alone would have limited effect&#xD;
      on symptoms of children with ADHD. Our aim is to test the use a cognitive remediation program&#xD;
      using a virtual classroom in children suffering from ADHD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Virtual reality offers the possibility to develop environments approaching situations of&#xD;
      daily life that can be used to target evaluation but also for therapeutic purposes. As the&#xD;
      school classroom is a daily life situation for children, Rizzo team has developed a virtual&#xD;
      classroom software (Rizzo et al., 2006). This virtual classroom is a tool for the diagnosis&#xD;
      of ADHD based on the exploration of attention deficit (distractibility, sustained attention&#xD;
      ...), impulsivity and hyperactivity. On the other hand, the playfulness of the application&#xD;
      helps the child to &quot;forget&quot; quickly that he is placed in a test situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the virtual classroom, the requested task is a letter detection task. The subject had to&#xD;
      click on the mouse only when he sees the letter &quot;K&quot; preceded by the letter &quot;A&quot; appearing. The&#xD;
      child had to perform this task, while the disruptive elements are distracting. These may be&#xD;
      auditory (the bell ringing), visual (a paper airplane flying in the class) or visual and&#xD;
      auditory distractors (the sound of the teacher who is moving).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive remediation using virtual reality is an innovative approach in the care of&#xD;
      children. We want to examine whether a cognitive remediation program based on the virtual&#xD;
      classroom software can be a therapeutic tool for children suffering from ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our study, cognitive remediation will be accomplished through cognitive intervention such&#xD;
      as a &quot;training&quot; of attentional and executive functions (such as planning, working memory,&#xD;
      selective attention, ...). The cognitive remediation sessions will include the execution of&#xD;
      the virtual classroom protocol, a stage of metacognition and again the virtual classroom&#xD;
      assessment. Our remediation program will include 12 sessions (twice a week for 6 to 8&#xD;
      consecutive weeks), lasting 30 minutes each. The effects of cognitive remediation will be&#xD;
      compared to the effects of two other major interventions usually proposed: drug treatment&#xD;
      with methylphenidate and supportive psychotherapy. 60 ADHD children aged 7 to 11 years will&#xD;
      participate in our study, 20 in each treatment group (drug treatment vs. cognitive&#xD;
      remediation vs. supportive psychotherapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect that cognitive remediation and drug treatment improve attentional abilities of&#xD;
      children with ADHD.&#xD;
