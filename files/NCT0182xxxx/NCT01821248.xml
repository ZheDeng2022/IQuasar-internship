  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Biliary tract cancer is one of the most lethal malignancies worldwide, with surgery&#xD;
      representing the only potentially curative treatment for this disease. However, many patients&#xD;
      are diagnosed as far advanced stage, which is too late for curative resection, and even if&#xD;
      surgery can be performed, the likelihood of relapse is very high. Lymph node metastasis is&#xD;
      the most powerful prognostic factor in biliary tract cancer, which makes accurate&#xD;
      preoperative assessment of lymph node metastasis important for indication of resection.&#xD;
      However, the diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of conventional imaging&#xD;
      techniques, including computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), seem to&#xD;
      be insufficient for accurate detection of lymph node metastasis. Previously, the&#xD;
      investigators reported FDG-PET is useful for prediction of lymph node metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, gemcitabine has been widely used to treat the patients with unresectable&#xD;
      or recurrent biliary tract cancer. In the Advanced Biliary tract Cancer (ABC)-02 study, the&#xD;
      first prospective multicenter phase III study in this field, the combination of&#xD;
      gemcitabine/cisplatin was compared with gemcitabine monotherapy and found that the&#xD;
      combination regimen significantly prolonged Median Survival Time (MST) (from 8.1 to 11.7&#xD;
      months; P &lt; 0.001). Gemcitabine/cisplatin combination therapy is now considered to be the&#xD;
      standard regimen for advanced biliary tract cancer. S-1 is an oral fluoropyrimidine prodrug&#xD;
      that has confirmed efficacy against various solid tumors, both alone and in combination with&#xD;
      other cytotoxic drugs. S-1 monotherapy has yielded good results against advanced biliary&#xD;
      tract cancer and gemcitabine/S-1 combination therapy has yielded promising results with&#xD;
      acceptable toxicity levels for patients with advanced biliary tract cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the investigators reported the safety and efficacy of adding S-1 to&#xD;
      gemcitabine/cisplatin combination regimen (GCS) for advanced biliary tract cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators evaluate the efficacy and the safety of preoperative&#xD;
      chemotherapy with Gemcitabine/ Cisplatin /S-1 for biliary tract cancers with lymph node&#xD;
      metastasis by FDG-PET&#xD;
