  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Escherichia coli is the primary cause of urinary tract infections and Gram-negative&#xD;
      bacteremia worldwide. Since the early years of the 21st century, E.coli has acquired a new&#xD;
      mechanism of resistance to antibiotics: extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL), type CTX-M.&#xD;
      These ESBL inactivate most β-lactams, the preferred class of antibiotics for the treatment of&#xD;
      severe E.coli infections. Moreover, the strains that produce these ESBL are often resistant&#xD;
      to other classes of antibiotics. Their rapid spread constitutes a major public health concern&#xD;
      because of a serious risk of therapeutic impasse. Treatment options in cases of infection&#xD;
      with ESBL-producing E.coli are often limited to carbapenems, a class of more recently&#xD;
      developed β-lactams. Carbapenems have a very wide spectrum of activity but their&#xD;
      effectiveness is threatened by the emergence of strains producing carbapenemases. The&#xD;
      development of therapeutic alternatives to treat ESBL-producing E.coli infections is&#xD;
      therefore essential. Cephamycins, including cefoxitin, are β-lactams marketed in the&#xD;
      seventies but their use was practically abandoned when wide spectrum antibiotics became&#xD;
      available. They are distinguished by the presence of an α-methoxy group in position 7 which&#xD;
      interferes with the action of the extended-spectrum β-lactamase and renders it ineffective&#xD;
      against cephamycins. Cefoxitin is therefore active in vitro against ESBL-producing E.coli and&#xD;
      offers the advantage of a narrower antibacterial spectrum, thus reducing the selection&#xD;
      pressure and the emergence of resistance. However, the in vivo activity of cefoxitin for the&#xD;
      treatment of ESBL-producing E.coli infections has never been measured. Furthermore, available&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) data for cefoxitin are dated and incomplete,&#xD;
      which raises many questions concerning the optimal dosage regimen. We have shown in a mouse&#xD;
      model of ESBL-producing E. coli CTX-M pyelonephritis that cefoxitin efficacy is comparable to&#xD;
      that of carbapenems without selecting resistant mutants. Cefoxitin could thus constitute an&#xD;
      alternative to carbapenems for the treatment of pyelonephritis caused by ESBL-producing&#xD;
      E.coli.&#xD;

      Clinical Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, multicentric, non-comparative, proof of concept study evaluating the&#xD;
      efficacy of cefoxitin in women with acute ESBL-producing E. coli pyelonephritis without&#xD;
      severity symptoms. This antibiotic is already commercially available and its tolerability&#xD;
      profile is well known, but it has never been previously evaluated to treat this particular&#xD;
      type of infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the clinical and microbiological response to&#xD;
      treatment with cefoxitin in women with acute pyelonephritis without severity symptoms due to&#xD;
      ESBL-producing E. coli.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In women with pyelonephritis caused by ESBL-producing E.coli:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gain a better understanding of the current epidemiology of ESBL-producing E. coli&#xD;
           associated with febrile UTI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the impact of cefoxitin use on the emergence of resistance in the colonising&#xD;
           bacteria of the gastrointestinal tract in women with pyelonephritis treated with&#xD;
           cefoxitin and identify the associated mechanisms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Characterise the PK/PD parameters for cefoxitin in order to optimise the dosage strategy&#xD;
           for that antibiotic&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the tolerance profile of cefoxitin&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of sample size, feasibility of enrolment No determination of the minimal sample&#xD;
      size could be calculated in this proof of concept study but a total enrolment of 40 patients&#xD;
      in the 8 participating centers seems adequate to evaluate the efficacy of cefoxitin for&#xD;
      treating uncomplicated acute pyelonephritis and to study its impact on the emergence of&#xD;
      resistance. Half of enrolled women will have repeated measurement of serum concentration of&#xD;
      cefoxitin: 6 blood samples collected within 6 hours following the injection of one of the&#xD;
      doses received between the 3rd and the last day of treatment. A security assessment by an&#xD;
      independent committee will be conducted on the first five patients enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The precise incidence of ESBL-producing E.coli acute pyelonephritis without severity symptoms&#xD;
      in the 8 participating centers is unknown. At BICHAT hospital, the incidence of&#xD;
      ESBL-producing E.coli in 2008 was 0.66/100 admissions (57 778 admissions/year). It was&#xD;
      0.46/1000 hospitalisation days at BEAUJON in 2009 with 36.5% from urine samples. The same&#xD;
      year, Saint-Louis hospital recorded 18 bacteremias secondary to infection with ESBL-producing&#xD;
      E.coli with 6% originating from a UTI. Those last numbers underestimate the actual incidence&#xD;
      of ESBL-producing E coli pyelonephritis at that hospital, only taking into account the UTI&#xD;
      associated with bacteremias. We estimate that there are approximately 10 cases of&#xD;
      ESBL-producing E.coli pyelonephritis in these centers each year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outline and conduct of the study/investigations performed by the CIC As soon as the&#xD;
      antibiogram is available, confirming diagnosis of an ESBL-producing E. coli and after&#xD;
      verification of the inclusion criteria, information and obtention of the the written consent,&#xD;
      cefoxitin (2 grams intravenous perfusion of 30 minutes every 6 hours) will be given for 10&#xD;
      days. A control visit and urine culture will be performed at day 2, day 7 and at the end of&#xD;
      treatment, day 10. A rectal swab will be performed at enrolment before the first dose of&#xD;
      antibiotic, at the end of treatment (day 10) and at day 40. The inclusion period will be 2&#xD;
      years and each patient's participation will last 40 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PK study will be performed on 20 patients enrolled at one of the 4 CIC at hospital&#xD;
      Saint-Louis, BICHAT, HENRI-MONDOR and HEGP. Measurement of serum concentration of cefoxitin&#xD;
      will be done on the 3rd day of treatment, or between the 9th and 12th dose of antibiotic.&#xD;
      Samples will be taken as follows: t0 (immediately before beginning infusing cefoxitin); t30&#xD;
      min (at the end of infusion); t45 min ; t1h ; t3h ; t6h (before the next dose) for a total of&#xD;
      6 samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation criteria for the primary objective Clinical and microbiological response defined&#xD;
      at the end of cefoxitin treatment by the presence of the 3 following criteria: (i) afebrile&#xD;
      (temperature &gt; 36° and &lt; 38°C), (ii) resolution of urinary symptoms present at the time of&#xD;
      diagnosis: dysuria, urgency, frequency, cloudy urine, pain on urination, pelvic or lumbar&#xD;
      pain (iii) sterile urine culture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation criteria for the secondary objective (i) Clinical and microbiological response at&#xD;
      48h after beginning treatment with cefoxitin; (ii) Early relapse at day 40; (iii) PK/PD&#xD;
      parameters; (iv) side effects of cefoxitin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics, PK/PD modelling, cefoxitin dosing regimen optimisation Qualitative variables will&#xD;
      be reported in percentage of the studied subjects and quantitative variables by a median.&#xD;
      Comparisons will use non-parametric tests. The tests will be bilateral and use a significance&#xD;
      threshold of 5%. The rate of clinical and microbiological response at the end of treatment&#xD;
      with cefoxitin will be reported as a percentage with an estimate of the confidence interval&#xD;
      (CI) of 95% (using a binomial distribution). PK analysis will be conducted using a population&#xD;
      approach and average PK parameters for cefoxitin will be estimated as well as interpatient&#xD;
      variability. The PK population analysis will examine different demographic and clinical&#xD;
      covariables in order to weigh their influence on PK/PD parameters; the studied covariables&#xD;
      will be: age, weight, BMI, blood pressure and creatinine clearance. In order to study the&#xD;
      relationship between pharmacokinetics and clinical response at H48 and at the end of&#xD;
      treatment as well as at J40±5, the patients' PK parameters will be compared using the&#xD;
      Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney non-parametric tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ESBL-producing E.coli strains responsible for pyelonephritis in women: typing and&#xD;
      identification of subtype&#xD;
&#xD;
      ESBL-producing strains will be screened with the synergy method, using a disk containing a&#xD;
      3rd generation cephalosporin, like cefotaxime, and another disk containing a β-lactamase&#xD;
      inhibitor, clavulanic acid, according to the recommendations of the competent authorities of&#xD;
      antibiogram. The isolated strains will then be analysed further on three main aspects: (i)&#xD;
      the phylogenetic group will be determined by multiplex PCR (ii) the strains' sequence-typing&#xD;
      will be done using Multiple Sequence Typing (iii) the presence of 46 genes associated with&#xD;
      extra-intestinal virulence factors will be identified through multiplex PCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The determination of ESBL type will also be done by PCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detection of cefoxitin resistant strains colonising the gastrointestinal tract of women with&#xD;
      pyelonephritis before treatment with cefoxitin ; emergence of resistance under treatment and&#xD;
      determination of associated mechanisms of resistance to cefoxitin&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening for enterobacteriaceae with reduced-sensitivity to cefoxitin will be done by&#xD;
      plating a rectal swab (or a stool sample) on DRIGALSKI media containing 10 mg/l of cefoxitin.&#xD;
      Acquired resistance mechanisms in species normally sensitive to cefoxitin (E. coli,&#xD;
      Klebsiella spp.) will be characterised: hyperproduction of Amp C in E. coli, hyperexpression&#xD;
      of efflux pumps and changes in purines in E. coli et K. pneumoniae. If comparing strains is&#xD;
      necessary, it will be done using ERIC2 PCR as previously described in literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical aspects&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research protocol will be presented to the ethics committee, once consent from the&#xD;
      promoter is obtained (with proof of the required insurance and payment of fees). The opinion&#xD;
      of the committee will be included in a form delivered by the promoter to the competent&#xD;
      authorities before beginning the study. All enrolled patients will be required to sign an&#xD;
      informed consent before any investigation or treatment is performed. The consent forms will&#xD;
      be kept for 30 years by the CIC. Patients will be informed of the results after completion of&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected public health impact of study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected benefits of using cefoxitin in women with uncomplicated acute ESBL-producing&#xD;
      E.coli pyelonephritis are (i) an clinical and microbiological effectiveness similar to that&#xD;
      of carbapenems;(ii) a decrease in the selection pressure on bacteria colonising the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract, thus contributing to prevent the emergence of carbapenemase-producing&#xD;
      Enterobacteriaceae (iii) a decrease in drug-associated cost.&#xD;
