  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An increasing incidence of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) is observed in our ageing&#xD;
      population. Since it is less invasive, endovascular repair (EVAR) by stent-graft (SG)&#xD;
      insertion is frequently indicated in patients with intermediate and high-operative risk.&#xD;
      Patient selection and stent planning for EVAR is done on CT-scans based on specific anatomic&#xD;
      criteria. SG are inserted in the catheterization laboratory under digital substraction&#xD;
      angiography (DSA) and fluoroscopic guidance. With this technology, no soft-tissue&#xD;
      differentiation is available during the intervention and important information are lacking&#xD;
      such as thrombus and aneurysm extension close to proximal and distal landing zones. Our team&#xD;
      has recently patented a software allowing the extraction of the AAA (lumen and thrombus) from&#xD;
      pre-operative CT-scanner. In collaboration with Siemens medical, the investigators have&#xD;
      integrated this technology to the Siemens workstation in the catheterization laboratory. The&#xD;
      investigators can now import the aortic lumen and thrombus meshes segmented from&#xD;
      pre-operative CT-scans and perform a rigid registration with fluoroscopy and DSA data to&#xD;
      enhance visualization of soft tissue during EVAR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our preliminary results are encouraging in terms of feasibility and visualization. However,&#xD;
      the delivery device of the SG and the guidewire used during the intervention are stiff and&#xD;
      induce a deformation of aortic lumen and thrombus. This deformation impairs the accuracy of&#xD;
      rigid registration. The investigators propose to improve registration accuracy by&#xD;
      implementing an elastic deformation of aortic lumen and wall based on the segmentation of&#xD;
      endovascular devices (delivery device, guidewires and catheters) inserted during the&#xD;
      procedure and by biomechanical modeling.&#xD;

      This project has 3 objectives: 1. To implement and validate a new optimized workflow enabling&#xD;
      rigid registration between AAA meshes extracted from preoperative CT-scan with fluoroscopic&#xD;
      images. 2. To develop an elastic registration of the AAA meshes based on 2D or 3D modeling of&#xD;
      the endovascular device. 3. To validate the accuracy of elastic registration and compare it&#xD;
      with the rigid registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental protocol: These 3 objectives will be completed in three experimental phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Improvement and implementation of the current rigid registration software. In this&#xD;
           phase, several new features such as an improved correction system by automatic capture&#xD;
           of DSA, an automated 3D/3D rigid registration, recognition of the origin of internal&#xD;
           iliac arteries will be implemented. This new beta version will be tested in 20 patients&#xD;
           at CHUM Research center and Dalhousie University-QEII Health Sciences Centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Implementation of an elastic registration based on endovascular device segmentation and&#xD;
           center line corrections. The luminal path of the segmented lumen on preoperative CT-scan&#xD;
           will be aligned with the path of the endovascular devices, then an elastic deformation&#xD;
           of the aortic lumen and thrombus meshes generated from CT-scanner will be applied and&#xD;
           registered to fluoroscopic and DSA images. A workflow allowing a fast recognition and&#xD;
           segmentation of endovascular devices from one to three stereotaxic fluoroscopic views&#xD;
           will be implemented in the Leonardo workstation and tested off-line on the previous 20&#xD;
           patient database and also in-vitro in realistic phantoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Online validation of elastic registration: The best strategy as defined above will be&#xD;
           validated clinically on-line. The beta version will be tested in real time in 20&#xD;
           patients requiring SG procedures and compared to the prior cohort having EVAR/FEVAR&#xD;
           procedures with rigid registration. The accuracy of rigid and elastic registrations will&#xD;
           be compared in the two experimental groups.&#xD;
