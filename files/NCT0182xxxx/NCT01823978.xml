    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, non-randomized, dose escalation study of the safety, biomarkers, and&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy of dendritic cell vaccine, BPX-201, plus activating agent, AP1903, in&#xD;
      patients with metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I study of therapeutic vaccine, BPX-201, plus activating agent, AP1903, in&#xD;
      patients with mCRPC. Patients will be screened within 8 weeks prior to first vaccine&#xD;
      administration (4 weeks prior to leukapheresis). The trial design consists of 3 cohorts of 6&#xD;
      patients each, receiving escalating doses of BPX-201 of 10 million (M), 20M and 40M cells,&#xD;
      respectively. Dose escalation will occur according to a 3+3 design. Patients will receive&#xD;
      administration of BPX-201 every other week for 6 cycles (1 cycle equals 2 weeks).&#xD;
      Approximately 1.6 mL of BPX-201 will be administered as 8 intradermal injections (200μL each)&#xD;
      at each treatment visit. On the day following each vaccination, a single 40 mg dose of the&#xD;
      activating agent, AP1903, will be administered via intravenous (IV) infusion over 2 hours.&#xD;
