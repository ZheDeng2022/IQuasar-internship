  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, open-label, sequential, single dose, 4-period crossover study.&#xD;
      This study is being conducted to measure the relative bioavailability of the original gelatin&#xD;
      capsule (GC) formulation and two new formulations (hydroxypropyl-methylcellulose [HPMC]&#xD;
      capsule and enteric coated tablet [ECT]) of afuresertib (AFU), in the fed and fasted state.&#xD;
      The study will be composed of Screening, Treatment, and Follow-up Periods. Screening&#xD;
      assessments to determine subject eligibility will be performed within 3 weeks prior to the&#xD;
      first dose of study drug in the Treatment Period. Eligible subjects will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive 4 of the 6 possible study treatments (A: AFU GC administered in a fasted state, B:&#xD;
      AFU GC administered in a fed state, C: AFU HPMC capsule administered in a fasted state, D:&#xD;
      AFU HPMC capsule administered in a fed state, E: AFU ECT administered in a fasted state, F:&#xD;
      AFU ECT administered in a fed state) in 4 treatment periods (one per treatment period).&#xD;
      Subjects will receive a single dose of one of the six study treatments (A, B, C, D, E, F) on&#xD;
      Day 1 of each Dosing Period, according to one of the 6 treatment sequences (CEDA, EFAB, ABFC,&#xD;
      BDCE, FCBD, DAEF). There will be a minimum of 10 Day washout period between the doses&#xD;
      administered in each Treatment Period. A Follow-up visit will be conducted within 10-14 days&#xD;
      after the last dose. A subject's total time involved in the study will be approximately 9&#xD;
      weeks. At least 36 subjects will be enrolled in the study, to ensure that at least 6 subjects&#xD;
      will be randomized to receive each treatment sequence.&#xD;
