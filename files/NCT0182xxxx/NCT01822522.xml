    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of cabozantinib s-malate in&#xD;
      treating patients with solid tumors that have spread to other places in the body and usually&#xD;
      cannot be cured or controlled with treatment and human immunodeficiency virus. Cabozantinib&#xD;
      s-malate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell&#xD;
      growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of cabozantinib (XL184) (cabozantinib s-malate)&#xD;
      as a single agent in solid tumor participants with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)&#xD;
      infection and to determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To investigate possible pharmacokinetic interactions between cabozantinib and&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy in persons with HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To investigate the effects of therapy on participant immune status and HIV viral load.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To preliminarily assess objective response rates associated with treatment for commonly&#xD;
      represented tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive cabozantinib s-malate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles&#xD;
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 7 days&#xD;
             before enrollment; women of childbearing potential include women who have experienced&#xD;
             menarche and who have not undergone successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy,&#xD;
             bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or are not postmenopausal;&#xD;
             postmenopause is defined as amenorrhea &gt;= 12 consecutive months; note: women who have&#xD;
             been amenorrheic for 12 or more months are still considered to be of childbearing&#xD;
             potential if the amenorrhea is possibly due to prior chemotherapy, antiestrogens,&#xD;
             ovarian suppression or any other reversible reason&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of cabozantinib on the developing human fetus are unknown; for this reason&#xD;
             and because tyrosine kinase inhibitors agents as well as other therapeutic agents used&#xD;
             in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men&#xD;
             must agree to use adequate contraception prior to study entry and for the duration of&#xD;
             study participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while&#xD;
             she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating&#xD;
             physician immediately; men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use&#xD;
             adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation,&#xD;
             and 6 months after completion of cabozantinib administration; sexually active&#xD;
             participants (men and women) must agree to use medically accepted barrier methods of&#xD;
             contraception (e.g., male or female condom) during the course of the study and for 6&#xD;
             months after the last dose of study drug(s), even if oral contraceptives are also&#xD;
             used; all participants of reproductive potential must agree to use both a barrier&#xD;
             method and a second method of birth control during the course of the study and for 6&#xD;
             months after the last dose of study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participating participants MUST receive appropriate care and treatment for HIV&#xD;
             infection, including antiretroviral medications, when clinically indicated and should&#xD;
             be under the care of a physician experienced in HIV management; participants will be&#xD;
             eligible regardless of antiretroviral medication (including no antiretroviral&#xD;
             medication) provided there is no intention to initiate therapy or the regimen has been&#xD;
             stable for at least 4 weeks with no intention to change the regimen within 8 weeks&#xD;
             following study entry; as study-specific (antiretroviral-based) strata fill, however,&#xD;
             only participants who are receiving the therapies eligible for the remaining open&#xD;
             strata will be accrued&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must in the opinion of the investigator be capable of complying with this&#xD;
             protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment with cabozantinib (XL184)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant has received radionuclide treatment within 6 weeks of the first dose&#xD;
             of study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant has received prior treatment with a small molecule kinase inhibitor or&#xD;
             a hormonal therapy (including investigational kinase inhibitors or hormones) within 4&#xD;
             weeks or five half-lives of the compound or active metabolites, whichever is longer,&#xD;
             before the first dose of study treatment; note: participants with prostate cancer&#xD;
             currently receiving luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) or&#xD;
             gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists may be maintained on these agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant has received any other type of investigational agent within 28 days&#xD;
             before the first dose of study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant has not recovered to baseline or Common Terminology Criteria for&#xD;
             Adverse Events (CTCAE) =&lt; grade 1 from toxicity due to all prior therapies except&#xD;
             alopecia and other non-clinically significant adverse events (AEs)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant has a primary brain tumor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant has active brain metastases or epidural disease; participants with&#xD;
             brain metastases previously treated with whole brain radiation or radiosurgery or&#xD;
             participants with epidural disease previously treated with radiation or surgery who&#xD;
             are asymptomatic and do not require steroid treatment for at least 4 weeks before&#xD;
             starting study treatment are eligible; participants with treated brain metastasis&#xD;
             should not take enzyme-inducing anticonvulsive therapies (EIACDs) within 2 weeks of&#xD;
             registration, though non-enzyme inducing anticonvulsive drugs such as levetiracetam&#xD;
             are allowed; neurosurgical resection of brain metastases or brain biopsy is permitted&#xD;
             if completed at least 3 months before starting study treatment; baseline brain imaging&#xD;
             with contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
             scans for participants with known brain metastases is required to confirm eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant has prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR) or&#xD;
             partial thromboplastin time (PTT) test &gt;= 1.3 x the laboratory ULN within 7 days&#xD;
             before the first dose of study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant requires concomitant treatment, in therapeutic doses, with&#xD;
             anticoagulants such as warfarin or warfarin-related agents, heparin, thrombin or&#xD;
             factor xabans (Xa) inhibitors, or antiplatelet agents (e.g., clopidogrel); low dose&#xD;
             aspirin (=&lt; 81 mg/day), low-dose warfarin (=&lt; 1 mg/day), and prophylactic low&#xD;
             molecular weight heparin (LMWH) are permitted&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant requires chronic concomitant treatment with the following strong&#xD;
             cytochrome P450 family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide 4 (CYP3A4) inducers OTHER than&#xD;
             antiretroviral agents: dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, rifabutin,&#xD;
             rifapentine, phenobarbital, primidone, modafinil, and other enzyme inducing&#xD;
             anti-convulsant drugs (EIACD), and St. John's wort; use of efavirenz or etravirine is&#xD;
             permitted for participants considered for the CYP3A4-inducer based antiretroviral&#xD;
             therapy (ART) regimen arm (Stratum B) of the trial; because the lists of CYP3A4&#xD;
             inducers are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a&#xD;
             frequently-updated list; medical reference texts such as the Physicians' Desk&#xD;
             Reference may also provide this information; as part of the enrollment/informed&#xD;
             consent procedures, the participant will be counseled on the risk of interactions with&#xD;
             other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the&#xD;
             participant is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant requires concomitant treatment with the following inhibitors of&#xD;
             CYP3A4:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Antibiotics: clarithromycin, erythromycin, telithromycin, troleandomycin&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Antifungals: itraconazole, ketoconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole, posaconazole&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Antidepressants: nefazodone&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Antidiuretic: conivaptan&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Gastrointestinal (GI): cimetidine, aprepitant&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hepatitis C: boceprevir, telaprevir&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Miscellaneous: Seville oranges, grapefruit, or grapefruit juice and/or pummelos,&#xD;
                  star fruit, exotic citrus fruits, or grapefruit hybrids); use of any of&#xD;
                  anti-retrovirals (delavirdine) or protease inhibitors (ritonavir, indinavir,&#xD;
                  lopinavir/ritonavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir) is permitted; specifically,&#xD;
                  ritonavir and cobicistat is permitted for participants considered for the&#xD;
                  CYP3A4-inhibitor based ART regimen arm (Stratum A) of the trial; because the&#xD;
                  lists of CYP3A4 inhibitors are constantly changing, it is important to regularly&#xD;
                  consult a frequently-updated list; medical reference texts such as the&#xD;
                  physicians' desk reference may also provide this information; as part of the&#xD;
                  enrollment/informed consent procedures, the participant will be counseled on the&#xD;
                  risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to&#xD;
                  be prescribed or if the participant is considering a new over-the-counter&#xD;
                  medicine or herbal product&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant has experienced any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Clinically-significant gastrointestinal bleeding within 6 months before the first&#xD;
                  dose of study treatment&#xD;
