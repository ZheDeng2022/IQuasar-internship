  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the effect of hydralazine isosorbide dinitrate on clinical outcomes, symptoms,&#xD;
      cardiac parameters and functional status of African patients hospitalized with AHF and left&#xD;
      ventricular dysfunction during 24 weeks of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration of hydralazine/nitrates will be superior to placebo administration in reducing&#xD;
      HF readmission or death, improving dyspnoea, reducing blood pressure and brain natriuretic&#xD;
      peptide (BNP) in African patients admitted with AHF and left ventricular dysfunction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) is a pathophysiologic condition and is a final common pathway of most&#xD;
      forms of cardiovascular disease. Patients with HF experience poor quality of life, recurrent&#xD;
      emergency hospitalizations and premature mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent publications highlight the multiple challenges of dealing with an increasing burden of&#xD;
      heart disease within an urban African community. The predominance of women and novel&#xD;
      underlying causes contrast with the demographic of HF in high income countries. More than 50%&#xD;
      of 5328 de novo cases of heart disease captured at a tertiary clinic in Soweto presented with&#xD;
      some form of heart failure, mainly due to poorly treated hypertension, idiopathic dilated&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy, peripartum cardiomyopathy and HIV-related cardiomyopathy. The most prevalent&#xD;
      form of heart disease was hypertensive heart failure (&gt; 1100 cases).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Programs have been developed in high income countries that cost-effectively prevent&#xD;
      progressive cardiac dysfunction in high risk individuals and apply evidence-based treatments&#xD;
      to optimize the overall management of HF. There is, however, a paucity of data describing the&#xD;
      etiology and underlying cardiac structure and function, as well as contemporary management of&#xD;
      HF in low to middle income countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2005 a number of leading clinicians from Africa and the US published a &quot;call for action&quot;&#xD;
      highlighting the need for an African study documenting the aetiology of acute heart failure&#xD;
      and the management practices applied to these patients. As a result, The Sub-Saharan Africa&#xD;
      Survey of Heart Failure (THESUS HF) study, was initiated in 9 countries in Africa to&#xD;
      determine aetiology, treatment, morbidity and mortality of acute heart failure (HF) in the&#xD;
      African sub-continent. The data reported in this study are unique as they are the first&#xD;
      larger outcome study in acute heart failure from this continent. This first multinational&#xD;
      study of over 1000 patients with acute decompensated heart failure conducted in all regions&#xD;
      of sub-Saharan Africa shows, for the first time, that the treatment of heart failure is&#xD;
      sub-optimal in the region, with relatively low proven medical treatments (such as&#xD;
      beta-blockers, hydralazine and nitrates) and inappropriately high use of aspirin in a cohort&#xD;
      of patients with non-ischaemic heart failure. This study also had the clear purpose of&#xD;
      enhancing research capacity in Africa via collaborative research as outlined in our&#xD;
      publication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of Ace inhibitors (ACEi) and hydralazine/nitrates has never been examined in patients&#xD;
      admitted with acute heart failure. All studies demonstrating the beneficial effects of these&#xD;
      drugs were performed in patients with chronic heart failure. Previous studies have shown that&#xD;
      the administration of ACEi in African Americans with chronic heart failure is less effective&#xD;
      and not superior to combined treatment with hydralazine/isosorbide dinitrate. The African&#xD;
      American Heart Failure Trial (A-HeFT) established the benefit of adjunctive administration of&#xD;
      isosorbide dinitrate/hydralazine (ISDN/HYD) in addition to standard therapy for African&#xD;
      American patients with symptomatic heart failure. The risk of death was reduced by 33% and&#xD;
      markers of quality of life were improved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The THESUS registry has shown a high prevalence of hypertension with left ventricular&#xD;
      systolic dysfunction (hypertensive heart failure) and dilated cardiomyopathy as a cause of&#xD;
      acute heart failure in all participating African countries. Patients in Africa are rarely&#xD;
      treated with this combination therapy as the fixed combination (Bidil) is unavailable in&#xD;
      Africa. There is uncertainty if the combination of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate,&#xD;
      available as generic agents, is beneficial in Africans and many physicians in Africa are not&#xD;
      aware of the outcome of those studies published in high impact factor journals, often not&#xD;
      available to local doctors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Performing a multicentre study in Africa could confirm data obtained in African Americans,&#xD;
      create awareness for this promising combination treatment and extend the use of the&#xD;
      medication to patients with acute heart failure.&#xD;

      changes to the Eligibility criteria and have been changed on this site.&#xD;

      To date, 22 Sept 2014, the BAHEF study has enrolled 110 study subjects. To date, 13 Aug 2015,&#xD;
      the BAHEF study has enrolled 145 eligible subjects.&#xD;
