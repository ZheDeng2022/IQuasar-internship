  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies report association between restless legs syndrome (RLS), HTA and&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanisms involved in this relationship remained unknown, but several evidences favor&#xD;
      the role of periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS), patterns frequently associated with RLS.&#xD;
      Sympathetic overactivity is associated with PLMS with increased pulse rate and blood pressure&#xD;
      coincident with PLMS. PLMS-related repetitive nocturnal blood pressure fluctuations could&#xD;
      contribute to the risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke in patients with&#xD;
      RLS, especially in the elderly. Several studies already reported that dopaminergic agonists&#xD;
      reduce the severity of RLS and the PLMS index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Do dopaminergic agonists reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases and associated autonomic&#xD;
      dysfunctions in patients with RLS ?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nocturnal BP (blood pressure) decline has major clinical implications, and the loss of normal&#xD;
      reduction in BP during sleep is associated with high risk of cardiovascular morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of rotigotine patch treatment on&#xD;
      validated cardiovascular risk factors ambulatory BP during night, day and night-to-day ratio,&#xD;
      and endothelial function in patients with idiopathic RLS compared to placebo.&#xD;
