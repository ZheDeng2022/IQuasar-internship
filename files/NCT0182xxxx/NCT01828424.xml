  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a large variability of postoperative pain intensity and of the drug doses necessary&#xD;
      to alleviate this pain. The investigators hypothesis is that a measurement of nociception at&#xD;
      the end of surgery, using either the RIII reflex threshold, measures of heart rate&#xD;
      variability or the pupil dilatation reflex measured by pupillometry, in relation to the doses&#xD;
      of opioids used intraoperatively will yield a prediction of postoperative pain.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute postoperative pain needs to be alleviated quickly to avoid sensitization in the&#xD;
      postoperative period, since sensitization can lead to pain chronification. Severe acute&#xD;
      postoperative pain is the most important risk factor in the development of persistent&#xD;
      postoperative pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, the dose of opioids necessary to alleviate postoperative pain is highly&#xD;
      variable, even between patients having been exposed to the same surgical procedure.&#xD;
      Anesthesiologists usually try to prevent immediate postoperative pain by adjusting analgesic&#xD;
      dosing at the end of surgery to the perceived need of analgesia. However, this approach is&#xD;
      limited by the problem of respiratory depression induced by a too large dose of opiate&#xD;
      analgesics. Studies have shown that despite these attempts many patients awake with moderate&#xD;
      to severe pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A means of predicting immediate postoperative pain after surgery and the response to opiate&#xD;
      analgesics would therefore be highly desirable. Many studies have tried to reveal predictive&#xD;
      factors which can be evaluated before the start of the surgery, but these can explain only&#xD;
      about 50% of the observed variability in postoperative pain intensity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A different approach may be the evaluation of intraoperative nociception at the end of&#xD;
      surgery to directly guide appropriate analgesia before the patient has regained&#xD;
      consciousness. Measuring reflex pupil dilation after a standardized electrical stimulus is&#xD;
      one method to measure opioid effect intra-operatively. This parameter may reflect opioid&#xD;
      sensitivity, but not pain sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is the evaluation of measures of nociception such as the&#xD;
      pupillary dilation reflex or heart rate variability on acute pain after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, pupillary dilation reflex and heart rate variability will be evaluated in their&#xD;
      predictive performance of blood pressure and heart rate changes due to intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed as a single centre, observational, descriptive study.&#xD;
