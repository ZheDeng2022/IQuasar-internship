    <textblock>
      This is an open label study on the pharmacokinetics and safety of ciclosporin in patients&#xD;
      with severe traumatic brain injury, who require intensive care unit admission and monitoring&#xD;
      of intracranial pressure via a ventricular catheter. 20 patients will be screened, and&#xD;
      subsequently enrolled after clinical stabilisation. Thereafter, patients will receive 2.5&#xD;
      mg/kg bolus dose infusion of ciclosporin, followed by either 5 mg/kg/day or 10 mg/kg/day of&#xD;
      ciclosporin as continuous infusion for 5 days+3 days monitoring at the intensive care unit.&#xD;
      After an additional 30 days, a follow-up phone call will be made to the patient, or the&#xD;
      patient's nursing staff, checking patient status and serious adverse events. The two dose&#xD;
      levels will be investigated in 10 patients each, starting with the lower dose level for the&#xD;
      first 10 patients. Patients will have samples of blood and cerebrospinal fluid drawn at&#xD;
      pre-defined time points during the study for pharmacokinetic assessment and evaluation of&#xD;
      biomarkers. Bedside monitoring with microdialysis and brain tissue oxygenation will be&#xD;
      performed. The safety monitoring includes nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, monitoring of&#xD;
      intracranial pressure (ICP), infections monitoring and adverse events collection and&#xD;
      reporting.&#xD;
