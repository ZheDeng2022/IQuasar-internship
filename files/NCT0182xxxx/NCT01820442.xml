  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess lofexidine related effects on QTc (an&#xD;
      interval of the heart rhythm) in subjects receiving buprenorphine maintenance. The secondary&#xD;
      objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of lofexidine by&#xD;
      evaluating and monitoring pharmacokinetics (amounts of drug in the blood), vital signs (heart&#xD;
      rate and blood pressure) and adverse events (side effects) when co-administered with&#xD;
      buprenorphine; to describe effects on opiate withdrawal when lofexidine is introduced&#xD;
      following a 50% buprenorphine dose reduction, as required to elicit a withdrawal response;&#xD;
      and to evaluate QTc interaction effects of lofexidine compared with placebo. The&#xD;
      Investigators hypothesize that while lofexidine is known to prolong the QTc interval, the&#xD;
      combination of the drugs will not create an additive effect which creates a significant&#xD;
      safety concern. The Investigators further hypothesize that subjects will be able to tolerate&#xD;
      the therapeutic dose of lofexidine (0.8 mg four times daily) when the buprenorphine&#xD;
      maintenance dose is lowered to elicit withdrawal.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multiple ascending dose study to&#xD;
      assess the safety, tolerability, and electrocardiographic effects of lofexidine in 30&#xD;
      buprenorphine-maintained adult subjects. The study will include a Screening Visit, an&#xD;
      Inpatient Treatment Visit, and a Follow-Up Visit. Subjects will be randomized in 4:1 ratio to&#xD;
      receive up to 4 tablets of lofexidine (0.2 mg/tablet) QID or 4 tablets matching placebo QID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who are on a stable dose of total daily sublingual buprenorphine 16-24 mg/day with&#xD;
      or without naloxone (Suboxone® or Subutex®, respectively), 16 - 24 mg/day, and who satisfy&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria will be eligible for the study. Subjects who are eligible&#xD;
      for the study will be encouraged to begin shifting their medication dose to a total daily&#xD;
      dose at 2 PM in anticipation of the study dosing schedule during the Inpatient Treatment&#xD;
      Visit. Subjects who are receiving Suboxone tablets or Subutex at study enrollment will be&#xD;
      converted to Suboxone film at the inpatient check-in and will receive Suboxone sublingual&#xD;
      film throughout the study. Within 21 days of the Screening Visit, subjects will report to the&#xD;
      inpatient study facility to begin the Inpatient Treatment Visit which will last between&#xD;
      approximately 11 to 21 days. This visit will include an inpatient check-in (1 day),&#xD;
      Buprenorphine Baseline (1 day), Initial Lofexidine Titration (3 to 5 days), 1 or 2 Lofexidine&#xD;
      Plateaus (2 to 4 days), Buprenorphine Reduction (2 to 6 days) and Buprenorphine Re-Titration&#xD;
      and Discharge (2 to 4 days). The order of steps subjects will proceed through during the&#xD;
      Inpatient Treatment Visit will vary depending on whether subjects are able to titrate to the&#xD;
      highest dose of lofexidine or placebo during the Initial Lofexidine Titration. The highest&#xD;
      dose of lofexidine (or placebo) will be 4 tablets QID (0.2 mg lofexidine per tablet or&#xD;
      placebo) for a total daily lofexidine dose of 16 tablets (3.2 mg or placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the Buprenorphine Baseline phase subjects will take a single daily dose of&#xD;
      buprenorphine at 2 PM. Buprenorphine Baseline Day study assessments will begin at&#xD;
      approximately 7 AM and include electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring, blood collection for&#xD;
      buprenorphine pharmacokinetics, and opiate withdrawal assessments (Clinical Opiate Withdrawal&#xD;
      Scale, COWS and Short Opiate Withdrawal Scale, SOWS). The next day subjects will proceed to&#xD;
      the Initial Lofexidine Titration phase. Subjects will continue using their baseline&#xD;
      buprenorphine dose. Lofexidine will be initiated at 2 tablets (0.4 mg or placebo) QID and&#xD;
      titrated in daily increments of a single tablet (0.2 mg or placebo) QID to a total daily dose&#xD;
      of 0.8 mg QID (or placebo), if tolerated by the subject. Lofexidine doses will escalate daily&#xD;
      unless at any point the subject meets protocol-defined dose hold criteria (described below),&#xD;
      which will trigger a reduction in dose to the previous highest tolerated dose (or to the 1&#xD;
      tablet dose, 0.2 mg or placebo, if subjects cannot tolerate the initial 2 tablets, 0.4 mg or&#xD;
      placebo). Once subjects have titrated to the highest dose (ie, 4 tablets QID) or once the&#xD;
      highest tolerated dose has been determined, they will proceed to a 2-day Lofexidine Plateau&#xD;
      phase during which they will continue to receive their buprenorphine maintenance dose. If the&#xD;
      subject is unable to titrate up to 4 tablets QID (0.8 mg or placebo), the subject will&#xD;
      continue to receive their highest tolerated dose in equal increments (eg, 2 or 3 tablets QID&#xD;
      at 8AM, 1PM, 6PM, 11PM) for both days of the plateau. Subjects who tolerate 4 tablets QID&#xD;
      (0.8 mg or placebo) on the first day will receive the 4 tablets QID (0.8 mg or placebo)&#xD;
      according to the normal dosing schedule. On the second day, the lofexidine dosing schedule&#xD;
      will be modified with subjects receiving a 1-tablet increase (ie, 0.2 mg or placebo) of the 1&#xD;
      PM lofexidine dose (5 tablets: 1 mg or placebo) and a 1-tablet reduction (0.2 mg or placebo)&#xD;
      in the subsequent lofexidine dose (3 tablets: 0.6 mg or placebo) with the other 2 doses of 4&#xD;
      tablets (0.8 mg or placebo) for a total daily dose of 16 tablets (3.2 mg/day or placebo). On&#xD;
      the second day of the Lofexidine Plateau phase, subjects will undergo ECG monitoring and&#xD;
      blood collection for buprenorphine and lofexidine pharmacokinetics. COWS and SOWS assessments&#xD;
      will be performed on both days of the Lofexidine Plateau.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who are titrated to a daily dose of 4 tablets (0.8 mg or placebo) QID while&#xD;
      receiving their full dose of buprenorphine will undergo a 4-day buprenorphine dose reduction&#xD;
      of 50% while continuing to take lofexidine or placebo at a daily dose of 16 tablets to&#xD;
      evaluate the effects of lofexidine on buprenorphine withdrawal signs and symptoms. These&#xD;
      subjects who complete the initial Lofexidine Plateau at a dose of 0.8 mg lofexidine (or&#xD;
      placebo) QID and who reach a COWS of 5 or greater prior to the fourth day of the reduced&#xD;
      buprenorphine dose administration may proceed early to Buprenorphine Re-titration and&#xD;
      Discharge at the Investigator's discretion. If the COWS score does not reach 5 within 4 days,&#xD;
      the subject will proceed to Buprenorphine Re-titration and Discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who are unable to titrate to the highest lofexidine dose (4 tablets: 0.8 mg or&#xD;
      placebo QID) while receiving their full dose of buprenorphine will undergo a buprenorphine&#xD;
      dose reduction of 50% for up to 6 days while continuing to receive their highest tolerated&#xD;
      dose of lofexidine from the initial titration. On the fourth day (or earlier at the&#xD;
      investigator's discretion based on withdrawal response), lofexidine titration will resume by&#xD;
      adding an incremental 1 tablet (0.2 mg or placebo) QID to the previously established&#xD;
      tolerated dose up to the maximum 4 tablet (0.8 mg or placebo) QID dose. During these&#xD;
      subsequent titration attempts lofexidine (or placebo) doses will escalate daily beginning on&#xD;
      the fourth day of the reduction (or earlier based on discretion of the investigator) unless&#xD;
      in any event a subject meets protocol defined dose-hold criteria (described below), which&#xD;
      will trigger a reduction in dose to the previous highest tolerated dose and will require the&#xD;
      Lofexidine Plateau procedures described above to be repeated while maintaining the subject on&#xD;
      their newly reduced buprenorphine dose (eg, 50% of their maintenance dose). Subjects who are&#xD;
      unable to titrate to a higher lofexidine dose during the 50% Buprenorphine Reduction than the&#xD;
      dose they titrated to during the Initial Lofexidine Titration will not repeat the Lofexidine&#xD;
      Plateau procedures. During Buprenorphine Reduction, COWS and SOWS assessments of opiate&#xD;
      withdrawal will be performed. On days when the lofexidine dose is increased, holter&#xD;
      monitoring and pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling will be done for those subjects who did not&#xD;
      titrate all the way up to the maximum dose of lofexidine during the initial titration period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following completion of the Lofexidine Plateau (repeated as necessary) and Buprenorphine&#xD;
      Reduction, subjects will begin the Buprenorphine Re-Titration and Discharge phase during&#xD;
      which lofexidine or placebo will be discontinued and buprenorphine will be re-titrated to the&#xD;
      starting dose (or to a higher or lower dose relative to baseline as medically indicated at&#xD;
      the discretion of the investigator). Lofexidine may be used to treat withdrawal symptoms, if&#xD;
      necessary. Following successful buprenorphine titration and completion of study assessments,&#xD;
      subjects will be discharged from the inpatient study clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will return to the study clinic for a follow-up visit 7 days (±2 days) following&#xD;
      clinic discharge for safety follow-up and adverse event collection. Subjects will be&#xD;
      discharged from the study at this time unless they are medically unstable on their dose of&#xD;
      buprenorphine. Subject may be medically followed at a regular interval, as determined by the&#xD;
      investigator, until the subject is considered sufficiently stable for study discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who withdraw consent or meet any one of the following study termination criteria&#xD;
      prior to completion of the study will be withdrawn. Study termination criteria will apply&#xD;
      only to pre-dose sitting vital signs and the daily safety ECG readings (excluding HR).&#xD;
      Baseline values for vital signs and ECG readings refer to values obtained at the time&#xD;
      subjects are admitted to the clinic. 1.Cardiovascular events including the following*: a.&#xD;
      Systolic blood pressure (SBP) &lt;70 mmHg and &gt;20% below baseline value, b. Diastolic blood&#xD;
      pressure (DBP) &lt;40 mmHg and &gt;20% below baseline value (if subject is asymptomatic, DBP&#xD;
      termination criteria &lt;30 mmHg), c. Heart rate &lt;40 bpm and &gt;20% below baseline value (if&#xD;
      subject is asymptomatic, HR termination criteria &lt;30 bpm), d. Changes in QTcF that meet any&#xD;
      of the following criteria: i.QTcF &gt;500 ms in females or QTcF&gt;480 ms in males, ii. QTcF &gt;25%&#xD;
      above baseline value for both males and females, iii. QTcF&lt;500 ms in females or QTcF &lt;480 ms&#xD;
      in males with a persistent (ie, greater than 24 hours) increase in QTcF value &gt;60 ms from&#xD;
      baseline accompanied by abnormal electrolytes (ie, potassium and sodium), e. Absolute QRS&gt;120&#xD;
      ms along with a 25% increase from baseline, f. Absolute PR&gt;240 ms along with a 25% increase&#xD;
      from baseline, g. Syncope h. Clinically significant arrhythmia (including telemetry&#xD;
      indication of ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, Torsade de Pointes, 2nd&#xD;
      degree AV block)&#xD;
&#xD;
      *ECGs and vital signs may be repeated as appropriate to confirm values and rule out&#xD;
      extraneous results. 2.Serious medical problems thought to be related or unrelated to the&#xD;
      study medications. 3.Intercurrent illness or medical complications that, in the opinion of&#xD;
      the site investigator, preclude safe administration of study medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of termination from the study, subjects will be discontinued from lofexidine or&#xD;
      placebo; however, they may remain inpatient for usually up to 4 days, with extension allowed&#xD;
      as deemed necessary per Investigator, while their buprenorphine maintenance dose is&#xD;
      re-titrated to their pre-study maintenance dose.&#xD;
