    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the single dose pharmacokinetic profile (explores what&#xD;
      a drug does to the body) and safety of Osmotic Release Oral System (OROS) hydromorphone in&#xD;
      chinese participants with cancer (abnormal tissue that grows and spreads in the body) who are&#xD;
      not opioid (morphine-like medications) tolerant (decrease in response to a fixed dosage of&#xD;
      drug over time and higher doses of a drug are needed to get desired effect).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single-dose study&#xD;
      in adult chinese participants with cancer. The study will consist of a screening phase&#xD;
      (within 21 to 1 days before admission to the research facility on Day -1) followed by a 4-day&#xD;
      open-label treatment phase (Day -1 to Day 3). Participants will remain confined to the study&#xD;
      center from Day -1 until completion of the end-of-study visit or withdrawal assessments,&#xD;
      which will be done upon completion of the 48-hour pharmacokinetic sampling on Day 3, or upon&#xD;
      early withdrawal. The total study duration will be approximately 24 days. All participants&#xD;
      will undergo a naloxone challenge test (at a subcutaneous [under the skin] dose of 0.8&#xD;
      milligram [mg]) for opioid dependency during the screening phase. Only those participants who&#xD;
      pass this challenge test will be allowed to continue in the study. During the treatment&#xD;
      phase, upon completion of a 10-hour overnight fast, participants will receive a single oral&#xD;
      (having to do with the mouth) 8 mg dose of hydromorphone in the morning of Day 1. Serial&#xD;
      blood samples will be collected immediately before and through 48 hours after dosing for the&#xD;
      determination of plasma hydromorphone concentrations. Participants will be administered&#xD;
      naltrexone 50 mg, to block the opioid effects of hydromorphone, 14 hours before, 2 hours&#xD;
      before, and 10 hours after study drug administration. After the 10-hour dose, additional&#xD;
      doses of naltrexone will be administered every 12 hours up to 34 hours postdose.&#xD;
      Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.&#xD;

             hydromorphone outer coating&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are unable to swallow solid, oral dosage forms whole with the aid of&#xD;
