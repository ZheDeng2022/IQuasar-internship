      The objectives of this pilot study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to determine whether a short cognitive test battery administered in the preadmission&#xD;
           test center can be used to cognitively stratify elderly patients presenting for elective&#xD;
           surgical procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to evaluate the cost of cognitive screening in the preoperative testing center in terms&#xD;
           of time and finances.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to evaluate patient perceptions about the use of preoperative cognitive screening and&#xD;
           their outcome expectations from their surgical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequent investigations may evaluate whether preoperative cognitive screening is a&#xD;
      predictor of postoperative morbidity and mortality in elderly surgical patients and whether a&#xD;
      short cognitive screen administered in the preadmission testing center could be used to&#xD;
      identify individuals with baseline cognitive impairments that should be refered for more&#xD;
      formal cognitive evaluation.&#xD;

      Detailed Description: Background and Significance: Approximately one-third of elective&#xD;
      surgical patients seen in the BWH Preoperative Test Center are 65 years of age or older and&#xD;
      national trends are similar. 15-30% of community dwelling elders have cognitive impairment.&#xD;
      Such impairment cannot be identified based on chronologic age alone because there is&#xD;
      considerable heterogeneity in cognitive abilities within and between age groups. In clinical&#xD;
      practice, however, the brain is one major organ system that is not assessed formally&#xD;
      preoperatively, so those with pre-existing cognitive deficits often go unrecognized. This is&#xD;
      a potentially important deficiency given the advanced age of many surgical patients, the&#xD;
      difficulty cognitive impairment may impose on ability to follow postoperative instructions,&#xD;
      and the fact that research studies show an association between pre-existing cognitive&#xD;
      impairment and risk for perioperative morbidity and mortality. Thus, preoperative cognitive&#xD;
      performance may be a predictor and/or modifier of postoperative outcomes.1,2,3 Interestingly,&#xD;
      no studies have documented patient perceptions regarding relationships between cognitive&#xD;
      performance and patient outcomes among elders presenting for elective surgical procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1: To determine whether each of two short cognitive tests administered in the&#xD;
      preadmission test center are equally useful in cognitively stratify elderly patients&#xD;
      presenting for elective surgical procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2: To evaluate the cost of cognitive screening in the preoperative testing center&#xD;
      in terms of time and finances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 3:To evaluate patient perceptions about the use of preoperative cognitive screening&#xD;
      and their outcome expectations from their surgical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequent investigations may evaluate whether preoperative cognitive screening is a&#xD;
      predictor of postoperative morbidity and mortality in elderly surgical patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Selection: Two hundred patients over age 65 years scheduled for an elective surgical&#xD;
      procedure without a planned postoperative admission to the ICU will be identified by the&#xD;
      Weiner Center for Preoperative Evaluation (PATC). The study will include patients of both&#xD;
      genders scheduled for surgery without planned admission to an ICU. Exclusion criteria include&#xD;
      a formal diagnosis of dementia (e.g. Alzheimer's disease), uncorrected vision or hearing&#xD;
      impairment (as it is necessary to see pictures and hear instructions), inability to speak,&#xD;
      read or understand English, and scheduled surgical procedures affecting the brain or&#xD;
      cerebrovasculature (i.e. intracranial neurosurgery, carotid endarterectomy). These ages are&#xD;
      chosen because cognitive impairment becomes more prevalent after age 65 years of age and&#xD;
      patients in this age group are at greatest risk for developing serious postoperative&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Enrollment: The Brigham and Women's Hospital is the only study site. When the&#xD;
      patients check in for their preoperative evaluation they will be asked by the registration&#xD;
      desk whether a study investigator can discuss the objectives and risks of a study that is&#xD;
      being performed in the preadmission testing center. If the patient agrees a member of the&#xD;
      investigative team will greet the patient and describe the purpose of study to them along&#xD;
      with its risk and benefits and provide them with the consent form for them to read. After the&#xD;
      patient has read the consent form they will be asked if they have any additional questions.&#xD;
      Once all questions have been answered the patient will be given the opportunity to decline or&#xD;
      provide written informed consent to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures: After consent is obtained the investigator will thank the patient and open&#xD;
      the next available sealed envelop which will contain a study registration ID number and open&#xD;
      the envelope wherein the group to which the patient has been randomized will be displayed&#xD;
      along with 3 stickers with the registration ID that will be placed on the testing&#xD;
      documentation. The Registration ID's will be randomly assigned to a group based on the&#xD;
      results of a random number generator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After randomization the investigator will hand the patient the Patient Survey (see Patient&#xD;
      Survey attached) on a clipboard with a pen attached and the patient will compete the survey&#xD;
      in the waiting room of the preadmission testing center. Once completed the investigator will&#xD;
      collect the survey. If the patient has been randomized to the Clock-in-the-box test they will&#xD;
      be handed the instructions to the test and be allowed to read them. After the patient has&#xD;
      read the instructions the patient will hand the instructions to the investigator who will&#xD;
      place a copy of the test form on the clipboard for the patients use. After the patient has&#xD;
      completed the clock-in-a-box test they will return it to the investigator who will thank the&#xD;
      patient for their participation in the study. A trained member of the investigative team will&#xD;
      score the clock-in-a-box test after the preadmission test center visit. (See attachment A for&#xD;
      the Clock-in-the-Box test and scoring).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients randomized to the Mini-Cog, a trained member of the preadmission test center&#xD;
      team who is involved in the patients routine preoperative evaluation will administer the test&#xD;
      during the course of the patients preoperative evaluation in a quiet room. They will first&#xD;
      instruct the patient to remember 3 unrelated words (egg, apple, table, penny). The patient&#xD;
      will be requested to repeat the words back to the clinician to ensure they heard the words.&#xD;
      Next the patient is instructed to draw the face of a clock with the hands on a specific time&#xD;
      (the time 11:10 has been endorsed). Finally the patient is instructed to recall the 3 words.&#xD;
      The Mini-Cog is scored by giving 1 point for each word recalled, a normal clock is scored as&#xD;
      2 points and an abnormal clock receives 0 points. Mini-Cog scores can range from 0 (worst&#xD;
      score) to 5 (best score). Because these studies are not intended to detect dementia nor&#xD;
      impact current medical care the test scores will not be released to the patient nor will&#xD;
      there be a referral to a neurologist for more formal cognitive evaluation although subsequent&#xD;
      investigations may study the value of doing so (see Attachment 2 for Mini-Cog test and&#xD;
      scoring).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other data to be collected will include the age of the patient, the total duration of time&#xD;
      the patient spent in the preadmission test center (check-in time to departure time), the&#xD;
      duration of their preoperative evaluation (time in the preoperative evaluation room) as&#xD;
      identified by the CPE tracking system and the monetary cost of this time in each area and&#xD;
      compared to those variables in patients over age 65 presenting for preoperative evaluation&#xD;
      the week before and the week after the study period and compared using a Student's t-test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biostatistical Analysis: For the Clock-in-the-Box test the number of patients with scores of&#xD;
      0-8 between the ages of 65-74 vs 75 and above will be determined and analyzed using a chi&#xD;
      square analysis. For the Mini-Cog test the number of patients with scores of 0-5 for ages&#xD;
      65-74 vs 75 and above will be determined and analyzed using a chi square analysis to&#xD;
      determine whether this tool can be used for cognitive stratification in patients in the&#xD;
      preadmission testing center. One would expect that older patients would score lower on this&#xD;
      test when compared to younger patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study does not involve a medical intervention or treatment or diagnosis of a disease&#xD;
      process but rather will determine whether cognitive stratification of elders is feasible&#xD;
      within the established flow of the preoperative testing center process of the Brigham and&#xD;
      Women's Hospital, the cost of such testing, and patient perceptions regarding the value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survey data will be presented as the percentage of patients agreeing with each statement when&#xD;
      binary and will provide valuable patient centered insight about their perceptions of&#xD;
      preoperative cognitive stratification and their outcome goals resulting from their upcoming&#xD;
      surgical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on duration of time spent in the preadmission testing center and duration of 1:1&#xD;
      preoperative evaluation for study versus non-study patients over the age of 65 will be&#xD;
      analyzed using a Student's t-test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks and Discomforts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks to patients are minimal, as the cognitive screening results will only be reported in&#xD;
      aggregate with no personally identifiable information. The cognitive screen will have no&#xD;
      impact on patient care and thus should not alter patient outcomes although some patients may&#xD;
      experience stress if they are having difficulty with the cognitive exam. All efforts will be&#xD;
      made to minimize risks by selecting investigators who are trained to the protocol and cued to&#xD;
      monitor the patient for undo stress. Patient participation in the study can be discontinued&#xD;
      at any time if the opinion of the investigator is that it is in the best interest of the&#xD;
      patient to discontinue participation or if the patient requests withdrawal from the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Benefits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no expected benefits to individual subjects participating in the study. This study&#xD;
      has the potential to aid and improve decision-making by physicians and elderly patients in&#xD;
      the future if they reveal a relationship between poor preoperative cognitive status and&#xD;
      adverse postoperative outcomes in elders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring and Quality Assurance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regardless of monitoring plans, the principal investigator is ultimately responsible for&#xD;
      ensuring that the study is conducted at his/her investigative site in accordance with the&#xD;
      IRB-approved protocol and applicable regulations and requirements of the IRB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Principal Investigator or a member of the investigative team will monitor each subject at&#xD;
      this single site, and will review the accuracy and completeness of Clock-in the Box, Mini-cog&#xD;
      and survey reports, source documents and informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no Data Safety Monitoring Board as the results of these studies will have no&#xD;
      impact on the care that patients receive. The outcomes of the study are intended to be&#xD;
      published in a peer-reviewed manuscript. All adverse events will be reported to the Partners&#xD;
      the Human Research Committee (HRC) in accordance HRC guidelines. A 24-hour/7-day telephone or&#xD;
      pager number will be provided for contacting the licensed physician investigator for this&#xD;
      purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research staff will monitor all subjects during the course of study involvement for&#xD;
      evidence of any adverse events such as unexpected stress and the testing discontinued and the&#xD;
      incident reported to Partners the Human Research Committee within 24 hours of local event&#xD;
      awareness (but no later than the next business day). The report will include a complete&#xD;
      description of the event, use of all concomitant medications, and the local investigator's&#xD;
      assessment of causality of the adverse event. Follow-up evaluations will be done until there&#xD;
      is resolution of the adverse events, which are unlikely as this protocol is non-invasive&#xD;
