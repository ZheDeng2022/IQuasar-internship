      In the current proposed trial the role of the low-dose WBRT (0.15 Gy) would be to safely&#xD;
      treat the microscopic distant GBM cells outside of the high dose RT region and sensitize the&#xD;
      gross tumor, while the focal radiation dose (1.85 Gy) to the gross tumor will bring the total&#xD;
      tumor dose of 2 Gy per fraction which is the standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiotherapy (RT) has been integral in the treatment of GBM since the 1970s when Walker et&#xD;
      al. showed that post-operative whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) offered significant&#xD;
      improvements in median survival time, and even more so when given with concomitant BCNU&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Ensuing dose escalation studies found the optimal dose to be 60 Gy. Patients&#xD;
      could not tolerate escalation to higher doses than 60 Gy with WBRT due to unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. Even with WBRT of 60 Gy, a huge volume of healthy brain tissue was unnecessarily&#xD;
      treated with high-dose radiation; recurrences with WBRT remained overwhelmingly local.&#xD;
      Hochberg and Pruitt (1980) found that after WBRT only 3% of recurrences were outside 2 cm of&#xD;
      the margins of the primary tumor. With the rise of the CT scan in the 1980s and the MRI in&#xD;
      the 1990s, along with subsequent improvements in three-dimensional conformal radiation,&#xD;
      partial brain RT (PBRT) became practical since tumor margins could be visualized and&#xD;
      irradiated more accurately. - Subsequently, WBRT was shown to provide no survival benefit&#xD;
      over PBRT at the same dosage; - thus, the latter took over as the standard of care.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Radiation Therapy (RT) has been integral in the treatment of GBM since the 1970s. Studies&#xD;
      showed that post-operative whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) offered significant improvements&#xD;
      in median survival time, and even more so when given with chemotherapy. Even with WBRT, a&#xD;
      huge volume of healthy brain tissue was unnecessarily treated with high-dose radiation;&#xD;
      re-growth of tumor with WBRT remained overwhelmingly close to the original tumor site. With&#xD;
      the advances in imaging techniques, like CT scans and MRIs, partial brain RT (PBRT) has&#xD;
      become a common practice. PBRT is RT given only to the tumor or area of the brain where the&#xD;
      cancer was removed. PBRT given with a drug called temozolomide (TMZ) is used as the standard&#xD;
      of care treatment for newly diagnosed GBM after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current data from our institution suggests that the combination of TMZ with very low-dose&#xD;
      WBRT efficiently kills GBM cells. WBRT at conventional higher doses is not given at the same&#xD;
      time as TMZ since the severe toxicity risk would be too risky. However, a lower daily WBRT&#xD;
      dose, than what is conventionally given to patients, should be tolerable. The randomized&#xD;
      trials studying TMZ with low-dose WBRT in patients with brain metastasis did not demonstrate&#xD;
      increased serious toxicities associated with TMZ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE OF STUDY Why is the research study being done? The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      determine if low-dose WBRT given in combination with the standard of care TMZ regimen is safe&#xD;
      and effective. The role of the low-dose WBRT would be to safely treat the microscopic distant&#xD;
      GBM cells outside of the high-dose PBRT region. We will continue to target the tumor with&#xD;
      focused PBRT that will bring the total tumor dose to the standard of care dose. This study&#xD;
      will find out what effects, good or bad, low-dose WBRT has on you and your cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROCEDURES How many people will take part in the study? About 47 people will take part in&#xD;
      this study. Patient participation in this study is voluntary. The research will be conducted&#xD;
      at UMMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What will happen if I take part in this research study? Before you begin the study… Patient&#xD;
      will need to have the following exams, tests or procedures to find out if you can be in the&#xD;
      study. These exams, tests or procedures are part of regular cancer care and may be done even&#xD;
      if Patient does not join the study. If he/she has had some of them recently, they may not&#xD;
      need to be repeated. This will be up to the study doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History and physical with neurological examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Brain MRI with contrast&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests (about 2-3 teaspoons of blood will be taken from the vein)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study… The experimental part of this study is that the patient will receive&#xD;
      low-dose WBRT. If the tests show that the patient can be in the study, and he/she chooses to&#xD;
      take part, patient will receive low-dose WBRT at the same time as standard PBRT. The patient&#xD;
      will receive RT once daily, 5 days a week (Monday through Friday) for 6 weeks (a total of 30&#xD;
      treatments). Each treatment lasts for no more than 30 minutes. Treatment will begin 3-6 weeks&#xD;
      after your last surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the same time as RT you will take oral TMZ once a day. TMZ will be taken continuously from&#xD;
      the night before the first day of RT to the last day of RT (maximum of 49 days). The pills&#xD;
      should be swallowed whole and taken on an empty stomach, therefore a minimum of 2 hours after&#xD;
      eating and with no food consumption for at least 1 hour after TMZ administration. The drug&#xD;
      will be taken at night.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 4 weeks after you finish RT and TMZ, you will begin 28 day cycles of TMZ alone. You&#xD;
      will take TMZ orally on the first 5 days of each cycle. Again, the pills should swallowed&#xD;
      whole and taken on an empty stomach, therefore a minimum of 2 hours after eating and with no&#xD;
      food consumption for at least 1 hour after TMZ administration. You should take the TMZ at&#xD;
      night.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patient misses any dose of TMZ, it will not be made up the next day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be treated with post-radiation TMZ for 6 cycles unless there is evidence of&#xD;
      tumor progression or treatment-related toxicity. Patients demonstrating continued benefit&#xD;
      from the adjuvant treatment can continue treatment to a maximum of 12 cycles at the&#xD;
      discretion of the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the exams, tests and procedures show that the patient can be in the study, and they choose&#xD;
      to take part, then he/she will need the following tests and procedures. They are part of&#xD;
      regular cancer care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weekly during RT and TMZ:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient evaluation with toxicity assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests (about 2-3 teaspoons of blood will be taken from the vein)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to starting each cycle of TMZ alone:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History and physical with neurological examination and toxicity assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests (about 2-3 teaspoons of blood will be taken from the vein)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prior to cycle 1 and then every 2-3 months, a brain MRI with contrast&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tests (about 2-3 teaspoons of blood will be taken from your vein) will also be&#xD;
      performed at about 2 and 3 weeks (days 14 and 21 (± 2days)) after starting cycle 1 and cycle&#xD;
      2 of TMZ alone&#xD;
&#xD;
      During follow-up…&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once patient has completed all the cycles of TMZ the patient will be seen every 1-3 months&#xD;
      for the first two years (years 1-2), 3-6 months for the next 2 years (years 3-4), and then&#xD;
      annually starting at year 5. During these follow-up visits the patient will have the&#xD;
      following tests and procedures performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History and physical with neurological examination and toxicity assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Brain MRI with contrast&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any other test deemed medically necessary&#xD;
&#xD;
      The doctors would like to keep track of the medical condition for the rest of the patient's&#xD;
      life. Keeping in touch with the patient and checking on their condition yearly helps the&#xD;
      physicians to look at the long-term effects of the study.&#xD;

        study entry or during participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
