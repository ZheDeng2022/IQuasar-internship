      The Olympus ScopeGuide® is a useful tool in speeding up colonoscopy and making it less&#xD;
      painful for patients. It is currently contraindicated by the manufacturer for use with&#xD;
      patients with implantable electronic devices (such as cardiac pacemakers). There is no&#xD;
      evidence to back up this contraindication and with the number of pacemakers being inserted&#xD;
      increasing by around 30 000 annually in the UK, more patients will be denied the use of this&#xD;
      device should they require a colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with Pacemakers or Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators will attend their&#xD;
      check appointment. Following this they will be asked to lie with a colonoscope connected to&#xD;
      the ScopeGuide® placed onto their abdomen (with clothes on) for 2 minutes. During this time&#xD;
      they will be monitored for any irregular cardiac activity which may indicate electromagnetic&#xD;
      interference. After this a second device check will occur and the participant will be sent&#xD;
      home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that the ScopeGuide will not interfere with the cardiac devices.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colonoscopy is the 'gold-standard' diagnostic procedure for visualising the inside of the&#xD;
      large bowel. It involves the insertion of a flexible instrument called a &quot;colonoscope&quot; around&#xD;
      the large bowel. During insertion, looping of the instrument inside the colon can lead to&#xD;
      incomplete procedures and significant patient discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of the colonoscope magnetic imaging device (Olympus ScopeGuide®) has allowed&#xD;
      the doctor performing the examination to detect looping of the instrument more easily. It has&#xD;
      been shown in several studies that the duration, patient experience and completion rate of&#xD;
      colonoscopy can be significantly improved by the use of ScopeGuide®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The manufacturer advises against the use of ScopeGuide® for patients with implantable devices&#xD;
      due to the theoretical hazard of electromagnetic interference leading to device malfunction.&#xD;
      Therefore, patients with permanent pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators&#xD;
      (ICDs) who require colonoscopy are denied the potential benefits offered by ScopeGuide®.&#xD;
      There is no documented evidence for this risk from case reports or studies and the&#xD;
      investigators have used a simulator to demonstrate that ScopeGuide® caused no interference or&#xD;
      malfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose an experimental study to evaluate the impact of the electromagnetic&#xD;
      field created by ScopeGuide® on the implanted cardiac devices in patients. The study will be&#xD;
      conducted in the Pacemaker Outpatient Clinic at Addenbrooke's hospital by a team of&#xD;
      investigators including gastroenterologists and cardiologists. After giving their consent to&#xD;
      participate, enrolled patients will have the activity of their cardiac device closely&#xD;
      monitored while in close proximity to ScopeGuide® and any effect of this on the cardiac&#xD;
      devices will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesise that ScopeGuide® does not create a magnetic field significant&#xD;
      enough to interfere with the normal function of these devices. If true, patients with&#xD;
      implanted cardiac devices can also be offered the benefit ScopeGuide® provides during&#xD;
      colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The justification for this research is that the ScopeGuide® is currently not used in patients&#xD;
      with implantable electronic cardiac devices (pacemakers and implantable cardioverter&#xD;
      defibrillators(ICDs)) due to the manufacturers advice. There are no case reports and no&#xD;
      studies in the medical literature to confirm or refute the advice and the investigators have&#xD;
      demonstrated no evidence of interference using a simulator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of patients with either a pacemaker or ICD is increasingly annually and with&#xD;
      services such as the NHS bowel cancer screening programme in which colonoscopy is offered to&#xD;
      patients with blood in their stool more of these patients are having this test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To deny these patients the use of the ScopeGuide®, which has been shown to reduce procedure&#xD;
      duration, reduce patient discomfort and increase completion rate without evidence is&#xD;
      unjustified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators therefore believe that this project is justified to potentially allow&#xD;
      patients with pacemakers or ICDs the benefit of ScopeGuide®. If the investigators demonstrate&#xD;
      evidence of interference, it would demonstrate a lack of safety in this patient group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the lack of data for the safety of ScopeGuide® for patients with implantable cardiac&#xD;
      devices we seek to question the current absolute contraindication imposed by the&#xD;
      manufacturer. The main question to be answered by this study is whether implantable cardiac&#xD;
      devices exhibit interference when exposed to the ScopeGuide®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population to be studied are individuals with implantable cardiac devices, attending&#xD;
      their regular device check appointment at Addenbrooke's hospital. The age range will be 18 to&#xD;
      80 years. Those being studied will be able to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES Primary Objective The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate in 100&#xD;
      serial participants whether the ScopeGuide® causes interference with implantable cardiac&#xD;
      devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives None STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary of Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is an uncontrolled trial. The study method will be undertaken on 100 consecutive&#xD;
      consenting participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be required for one visit only. This will be during their routine&#xD;
      implantable device check appointment. Participation will extend their routine check&#xD;
      appointment time by around 30 minutes. Once they have completed the study procedure they will&#xD;
      not be required for follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the study for an individual participant is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attend regular cardiac device check appointment (around 20 minutes) Exposure to ScopeGuide®&#xD;
      device while being monitored (around 10 minutes) Repeat cardiac device check (around 20&#xD;
      minutes)&#xD;
