  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      E1Z11 is a study to determine whether certain genetic information can predict which breast&#xD;
      cancer patients will discontinue treatment with AIs due to the development of musculoskeletal&#xD;
      symptoms (MSS). Women with stage 1-111 breast cancer who are prescribed the aromatase&#xD;
      inhibitor anastrozole as treatment may join.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To validate previously identified associations between 10 specific single nucleotide&#xD;
      polymorphisms (single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs]) and discontinuation of treatment with&#xD;
      aromatase inhibitors (AIs) due to the development of musculoskeletal symptoms (MSS) among&#xD;
      women with breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine whether other SNPs in cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP), glucuronosyltransferases&#xD;
      (UGT), Vitamin D, serotonin and other receptors are associated with discontinuation of&#xD;
      treatment due to the development of severe aromatase inhibitor-associated musculoskeletal&#xD;
      symptoms (AIMSS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine whether other SNPs in CYP, UGT, Vitamin D, serotonin and other receptors are&#xD;
      associated with the development of other potential complications of AI therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To develop a gene signature that can identify patients at risk for developing severe&#xD;
      anastrozole-related AIMSS and other potential complications of AI therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine the epidemiology and predictors of severe AIMSS and of AI discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To describe patient reported outcomes for minority patients with breast cancer treated&#xD;
      with AIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To assess the utility of the Patient Reported Outcomes Management Information System&#xD;
      (PROMIS) system to collect patient reported outcomes in a cooperative group study, and&#xD;
      validate the PROMIS Physical Function 20a form in patients with AIMSS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To develop a model that incorporates patient ratings of treatment burden, fear of&#xD;
      recurrence and adherence behaviors to describe patient decisions to continue or discontinue&#xD;
      anastrozole.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. To collect serum samples for future testing for biomarkers of AIMSS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive anastrozole orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 12 months.&#xD;

    <description>Logistic regression will be used to test the association between having a minor allele and the log odds of discontinuation of treatment, adjusting for covariates.
