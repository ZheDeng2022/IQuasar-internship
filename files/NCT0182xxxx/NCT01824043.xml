      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the effectiveness of intravitreal applications of 0.5 mg Lucentis&#xD;
      (ranibizumab) in patients with vitreous hemorrhage due to proliferative diabetic retinopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint for the study will be the mean change in best-corrected visual acuity&#xD;
      (BCVA) from baseline to the mean level at Month 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess any differences in mean change in BCVA over time;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess differences in vitreous transparency (amount of hemorrhage) with fundus&#xD;
           angiography exam;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess any differences in retinopathy severity level according to the Early Treatment&#xD;
           Diabetic Retinopathy Study;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To correlate the visual outcomes with serum glucose levels.&#xD;

      Written informed consent must be obtained before any study assessment is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will have only one group of patients, with a total of twenty subjects stratified&#xD;
      based on decreased visual acuity due to vitreous hemorrhage in proliferative diabetic&#xD;
      retinopathy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stratus 1 (ten subjects): patients with low to moderate diabetic vitreous hemorrhage; Stratus&#xD;
      2 (ten subjects): patients with severe diabetic vitreous hemorrhage. Patients will be treated&#xD;
      monthly: intravitreal ranibizumab (0.5 mg) will be administered in an open-label fashion,&#xD;
      using 3 monthly injections (at day 0, day 30 and day 60) followed by an additional post&#xD;
      treatment visit, a month after the last injection, for posterior reports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During regular, monthly visits, a detailed ophthalmologic evaluation will be performed,&#xD;
      including a BCVA assessment. Vitreous hemorrhage density will also be assessed, according to&#xD;
      the fundus visualization in retinal angiography:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. low to moderate vitreous hemorrhage: posterior pole detail slightly hazy or very hazy;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. severe vitreous hemorrhage: fundus details not visible. All patients with severe&#xD;
           vitreous hemorrhage will have A/B ultrasound scan performed in the day of the injection.&#xD;
           The intravitreal injection will always be the last procedure performed in a given day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will also be collected in each study visit, in order to assess serum glucose&#xD;
      levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laser treatment may be administered at investigator's discretion if vitreous hemorrhage&#xD;
      reduce or disappear after the intravitreal treatment with ranibizumab to such a retinal&#xD;
      fundus visibility level that permits photocoagulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients of the study will be monitored about adverse events and will remain in their&#xD;
      usual clinical and ophthalmological care after the end of the study.&#xD;
