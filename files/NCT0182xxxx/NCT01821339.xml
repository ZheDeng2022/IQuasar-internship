      The purpose of this study is to determine whether displacement on one or all of the standard&#xD;
      radiography views done within 6 months and 1 year after a pelvic injury is related to health&#xD;
      related quality of life outcomes of patients with an isolated pelvic ring injury.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter prospective investigation to assess the clinical outcomes of patients&#xD;
      with an isolated pelvic ring injury. The study team plans on enrolling 60 subjects. This&#xD;
      group will include both patients treated with and without surgical repair of the pelvic ring&#xD;
      injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concomitant injuries will be accounted in two ways first by tracking the patient's ISS&#xD;
      (Injury Severity Score), second by tracking lower extremity fractures and lumbar spine&#xD;
      injuries that require fixation. All patients will be enrolled within 2 weeks of injury to&#xD;
      allow collection of outcome information asking the patients to score in a manner reflecting&#xD;
      their perceived pre-injury level of function. The outcome instruments administered will&#xD;
      include the short-musculoskeletal functional assessment (SMFA), the Oswestry Disability&#xD;
      Score, Majeed Pelvis Score, and a visual analog pain score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient demographics including age, income level, educational level, family support, and work&#xD;
      status will be recorded. Additional demographic information associated with motivation of&#xD;
      recovery from injury will be collected at the time of enrollment. Associated aspects of the&#xD;
      injury including neurologic, urologic, or bowel injuries associated with the injury will be&#xD;
      documented. All operative complications or wound infections involving the care of the pelvic&#xD;
      ring injury will also be recorded. Injury classification and operative data of surgical&#xD;
      repair will also be collected. At time of follow-up neurologic deficits, evidence of painful&#xD;
      hardware, limb length discrepancy will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial radiographs and CT imaging will be taken in accordance with standard clinical care at&#xD;
      participating centers. The decision for operative or non-operative management will be made at&#xD;
      the discretion of the treating surgeon. At 6 months and 1 year follow-up time points, plain&#xD;
      film radiographs including an AP Pelvis, 40 degree inlet and 40 degree outlet views will be&#xD;
      made with a calibrated marker as described by Suzuki et al. Calibrated markers are available&#xD;
      in standard clinical practice in Orthopaedic Surgery outpatient clinic radiology units. Use&#xD;
      of the calibrated marker requires only that the marker, a metal ball 25mm in diameter, is&#xD;
      included in the x-ray beam adjacent to the patient at the time of taking the radiograph.&#xD;
      Radiographs are routine clinical practice at the follow-up time points in these patients.&#xD;
      Outcome instruments will be administered to the patient at these time points as well.&#xD;
