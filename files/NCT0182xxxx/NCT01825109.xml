  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rotavirus is the leading cause of severe gastroenteritis in infants and young children&#xD;
      worldwide and is estimated to account for 600,000 deaths in children &lt;5 years of age.&#xD;
      However, live oral enteric vaccines (e.g. OPV, cholera vaccines, typhoid vaccine) have been&#xD;
      less immunogenic in poor communities with high levels of malnutrition and poor sanitation.&#xD;
      Rotavirus vaccines also appear to be less immunogenic in the setting where they are most&#xD;
      needed. High maternal antibody (IgG) to rotavirus and breast feeding near the time of&#xD;
      vaccination may inhibit rotavirus vaccine effectiveness. We propose a quick study to look at&#xD;
      practical ways to improve the immunogenicity of rotavirus vaccine in our own setting in&#xD;
      Bangladesh. The objectives are to assess if delaying Rotarix vaccination will improve the&#xD;
      immune response to the vaccine and to assess if avoiding breastfeeding in the 45 minutes&#xD;
      before and after vaccine administration will improve the immune response to administration of&#xD;
      Rotarix vaccine. The study will be conducted in the urban Dhaka Mirpur Community, a setting&#xD;
      where previous rotavirus vaccine immunogenicity studies have been successfully conducted. A&#xD;
      total of 300 infant will be randomly assigned to one of the following groups: 1)&#xD;
      Administration of Rotarix at 6 and 10 weeks co-administered with oral polio virus vaccine&#xD;
      with no intervention in normal breastfeeding practices before and after receiving vaccine. 2)&#xD;
      Administration of Rotarix at 6 and 10 weeks co-administered with oral polio virus.&#xD;
      Breastfeeding will not be permitted 45 minutes prior to vaccine administration and 45 minutes&#xD;
      after each vaccine administration. 3) Administration of Rotarix at 14 and 18 weeks&#xD;
      co-administered with oral polio virus, with no intervention in normal breastfeeding practices&#xD;
      before and after receiving vaccine. 4) Administration of Rotarix at 14 and 18 weeks&#xD;
      co-administered with oral polio virus. Breastfeeding will not be permitted 45 minutes prior&#xD;
      to vaccine administration and 45 minutes after each vaccine administration. Blood and stool&#xD;
      samples will be collected from infants and breast milk from mothers. The primary outcome is&#xD;
      to determine the sero-conversion rate of anti-rotavirus IgA in different groups of infants.&#xD;

      The study will be conducted in a suburb of Dhaka in the area of Mirpur. Mirpur is one of the&#xD;
      14 Thanas of Dhaka cities with a population of about one million in an area of 59 square&#xD;
      kilometers. Mirpur Thana of Dhaka city is divided into several sections. There are 14&#xD;
      sections in Mirpur Thana. The area is densely populated and located 20 minutes away from the&#xD;
      lCDDR,B's Dhaka Hospital . The population is stable with low socioeconomic conditions. The&#xD;
      average income in the slum areas of Mirpur is Tk.4200 (about US $ 62) per month per family.&#xD;
      25% of fathers and 15% of mothers have more than 5 years of formal education. The study will&#xD;
      be conducted in section 11 and 12 of Mirpur which has a population of about 500,000. We&#xD;
      recently conducted phase I and II of the rotavirus vaccine study in this site. Several other&#xD;
      studies (phase II ETEC, killed cholera vaccine) are ongoing in this area. Children will be&#xD;
      identified through active surveillance of new births in the community and the study subjects&#xD;
      will be recruited through home visits by the locally recruited field workers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 .Design : Randomized intervention trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Administration of Rotarix at 6 and 10 weeks co-administered with oral polio virus&#xD;
           vaccine with no intervention in normal breastfeeding practices before and after&#xD;
           receiving vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Administration of Rotarix at 6 and 10 weeks co-administered with oral polio virus.&#xD;
           Breastfeeding will not be permitted 45 minutes prior to vaccine administration and 45&#xD;
           minutes after each vaccine administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Administration of Rotarix at 14 and 18 weeks co-administered with oral polio virus, with&#xD;
           no intervention in normal breastfeeding practices before and after receiving vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Administration of Rotarix at 14 and 18 weeks co-administered with oral polio virus.&#xD;
           Breastfeeding will not be permitted 45 minutes prior to vaccine administration and 45&#xD;
           minutes after each vaccine administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood draw at the time of first dose of Rotavirus vaccine and 4 weeks after the second&#xD;
           dose&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Breast milk sample at 6 weeks for the mothers in study groups A and B, and at 14 weeks&#xD;
           for mothers in study groups C and D (see below for groups).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stool sample prior to dose one and on day 3 and 7 after each dose to look for vaccine&#xD;
           virus shedding&#xD;
