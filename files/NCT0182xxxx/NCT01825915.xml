      Observational studies suggest faster recovery and quicker return to normal activities&#xD;
      following laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy (LSH which involves removal of the body of&#xD;
      the womb but conservation of the neck of the womb or cervix) compared with laparoscopic&#xD;
      hysterectomy (LH in which both the body and neck of the womb are removed) in women with&#xD;
      benign uterine disease. Data from the only randomised controlled trial (RCT) on the topic&#xD;
      does not support this observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators set out to investigate the feasibility of a double blind RCT comparing&#xD;
      post-operative recovery following LH with that following LSH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators set out to recruit 50 participants from a single gynaecological surgeon's&#xD;
      caseload. Web based randomisation was carried out at the time of study laparoscopy. Surgery&#xD;
      was performed using a standardised technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants and the data handler were blinded to treatment allocation (double blind study&#xD;
      where neither the patient nor the surgeon have knowledge of treatment group allocation at the&#xD;
      time of questionnaire analysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome is feasibility of recruitment to the study. The null hypothesis for this&#xD;
      study is that 'a double blind, randomised controlled comparison of recovery following&#xD;
      laparoscopic hysterectomy with recovery following laparoscopic sub-total hysterectomy' is not&#xD;
      feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes included validated post-operative recovery and mood questionnaires at&#xD;
      baseline, prior to discharge and at weekly intervals for 12 weeks. Validated questionnaires&#xD;
      regarding pelvic floor function and sexual function will be assessed at baseline, 6 weeks and&#xD;
      6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The findings of the feasibility study will inform the power calculation for a planned&#xD;
      definitive study ( the magnitude of the differences found between the 2 arms of the&#xD;
      feasibility study will allow calculation of the total number of participants required in a&#xD;
      definitive study to allow demonstration of statistically significant differences in&#xD;
      outcomes).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Hysterectomy remains the last resort for a number of benign conditions which have failed to&#xD;
      respond to conservative measures. Hysterectomy is also performed for operable gynaecological&#xD;
      malignancy which is excluded from the present study. Conventional techniques for uterine&#xD;
      extirpation involve open surgery through an abdominal or vaginal incision. In the&#xD;
      laparoscopic approach small incisions are made in the abdomen to allow insertion of a&#xD;
      laparoscope and operative instruments. In Laparoscopic Sub-total Hysterectomy (LSH) the&#xD;
      entire procedure is performed laparoscopically, the cervix is left in situ and the specimen&#xD;
      is removed through an abdominal port (See Appendix I for classification of laparoscopic&#xD;
      hysterectomy). In Laparoscopic Hysterectomy (LH) part of the operation is performed&#xD;
      laparoscopically, up to and including division of the uterine vessels, but the specimen is&#xD;
      removed with the cervix through an open vaginal vault. (See Appendix II for detailed&#xD;
      description of equipment and technique).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Popularity of hysterectomy shows a geographical distribution from a high of 5.4 per thousand&#xD;
      women in the USA (Farquhar 2002) to a nadir of 1.2/1000 in Norway (Backe et al 1993). Despite&#xD;
      the high prevalence, how and in whom hysterectomy should be undertaken remains controversial.&#xD;
      A Cochrane systematic review of methods of hysterectomy concluded that fewest complications&#xD;
      occur with vaginal hysterectomy (VH) whereas abdominal hysterectomy (AH) carries the highest&#xD;
      risk (Johnson et al 2006). The meta-analysis included 27 RCTs with a total of 3643&#xD;
      participants comparing one surgical approach of hysterectomy to another. The authors&#xD;
      concluded that VH should be the approach of choice for benign indications as it is a fast,&#xD;
      relatively cheap technique with rapid recovery and a low complication rate. LH should be&#xD;
      offered when VH is not practicable. Despite this grade 1 evidence most hysterectomies&#xD;
      worldwide are performed as total abdominal hysterectomies (TAH) when the whole uterus with&#xD;
      attached cervix is removed through an abdominal incision (Garry 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the introduction of population cervical screening it remained routine practice to&#xD;
      remove the non-diseased cervix at the time of hysterectomy to prevent cancer of the cervical&#xD;
      stump (Munro 1997). Total hysterectomy (TH) was therefore standard and sub-total hysterectomy&#xD;
      (STH) was usually reserved for those rare clinical circumstances when removal of the cervix&#xD;
      was deemed unduly difficult or risky for the patient. A number of retrospective studies have&#xD;
      shown reduced operating time, reduced ureteric complications and reduced blood loss with STH&#xD;
      (Kilkku et al 1983, Kilkku 1985, Brown et al 2000, Lalos and Bjerle1986). It has been&#xD;
      postulated that TH leads to more extensive disruption of pelvic innervation than STH with&#xD;
      accompanied increased risk of poor bladder, bowel and sexual function. However, RCTs have&#xD;
      failed to confirm this hypothesis (Thakar et al 2002, Gimbel et al 2003). Indeed a recent&#xD;
      Cochrane systematic review has shown no difference in the rates of continence, constipation&#xD;
      or measures of sexual function between STH and TH (Lethaby 2006). Why findings of the RCTs do&#xD;
      not match observational data is unclear. Perhaps the tools used for assessment of the outcome&#xD;
      measures studied are not sufficiently sensitive or have been applied too infrequently to&#xD;
      detect a clinically important difference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) was introduced by Harry Reich (Reich et al 1989) and&#xD;
      was modified into laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH) with a sub-total&#xD;
      variation, LSH, introduced by the minimal access pioneer Kurt Semm in 1991 (Mettler et al&#xD;
      1997). Only 1 randomised comparison on the subject has been published (Morreli et al 2007)&#xD;
      with no significant differences found on comparison of LSH and TLH with respect to&#xD;
      complications or post-operative recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Case series suggest recovery from LSH occurs much earlier with return to normal quoted from&#xD;
      within 3-21 days (Lyons 1997, Jugnet et al 2001, Schwartz 1994, Zupi et al 2003 and Donnez &amp;&#xD;
      Nisolle 1993). It follows that in order to detect a difference in recovery between the 2&#xD;
      treatment groups frequent assessments are necessary during the first 12 weeks following&#xD;
      surgery. Post-operative recovery will be assessed in participants of the current study at 6&#xD;
      hours after surgery, at the time of discharge and at weekly intervals until 12 weeks from&#xD;
      surgery and at study completion using a validated questionnaire (QoR-40 Myles 2000 Appendix&#xD;
      VI). In a recent systematic review of 'Recovery Specific Quality of Life Instruments'&#xD;
      (Kluivers et al 2008) the QoR-40 was the best validated tool with regards to short term post&#xD;
      operative recovery. A second questionnaire will be completed at the same times to assess&#xD;
      symptoms of depression (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale CES-D Appendix&#xD;
      VII). With regards to urinary, bowel and sexual symptoms a 3rd validated questionnaire, the&#xD;
      e-PAQ version 10 (Radley 2007 Appendix VIII) will be completed at recruitment, at the 6 week&#xD;
      follow-up visit and at 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge there has been no published RCT comparing LSH with LH. The approach of&#xD;
      choice for hysterectomy for benign indications is vaginal. When VH is not practicable LH&#xD;
      should be offered but there is paucity of evidence with regards to which type of laparoscopic&#xD;
      hysterectomy should be offered. The feasibility study outlined is designed to assess whether&#xD;
      it is realistic and practicable to recruit to an RCT aimed at addressing this enormous gap in&#xD;
      the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims of the feasibility study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 To determine the rate of recruitment to a randomised controlled trial comparing short term&#xD;
      outcomes following laparoscopic hysterectomy versus laparoscopic sub-total hysterectomy 2 To&#xD;
      assess the validated questionnaires used in discerning differences between the groups&#xD;
      undergoing the two types of laparoscopic hysterectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 To provide pilot data to inform power calculations for the full RCT. 4 To determine the&#xD;
      acceptability to randomisation. 5 To identify potential obstacles to recruitment to this&#xD;
      study in our centre. Aims of the proposed definitive study are outlined in order justify the&#xD;
      tools used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To test the hypothesis that LSH is associated with an accelerated recovery and return to&#xD;
           normal activity when compared with LH.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To test the hypothesis that LSH leads to a decreased incidence of postoperative&#xD;
           troublesome urinary symptoms compared with LH.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To test the hypothesis that LSH leads to a decreased incidence of postoperative&#xD;
           troublesome bowel symptoms compared with LH.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To test the hypothesis that LSH leads to a lesser deterioration of sexual function&#xD;
           postoperatively compared with LH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6] To test the hypothesis that LSH is associated with fewer symptoms of depression when&#xD;
      compared with LH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women in whom hysterectomy is indicated for a benign condition and in whom a laparoscopic&#xD;
      hysterectomy is feasible will be invited to take part in the study. The feasibility study&#xD;
      sample will be invited from the current caseload at the pilot hospital (Author's main&#xD;
      hospital of practice). All invitees will be provided with written information and informed&#xD;
      consent obtained. Women who express their willingness will be assessed for their eligibility&#xD;
      according to the criteria below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible invitees will include all premenopausal women in whom hysterectomy is indicated for&#xD;
      benign indications and in whom either technique is considered feasible after initial&#xD;
      laparoscopic survey. Exclusion criteria were predefined as post menopausal status, suspected&#xD;
      malignancy, abnormal cervical smears or a history of treatment of a high grade cervical&#xD;
      intraepithelial neoplasia within 10 years of recruitment, uterine greater than 14 weeks size,&#xD;
      raised BMI (Body Mass Index) &gt; 35Kg/M2, uterovaginal prolapse &gt; Stage 1 (Bump et al 1996,&#xD;
      previous gynaecological malignancy, previous extensive pelvic surgery, current&#xD;
      psychological/psychiatric disease, current anti-depressant/anti-psychotic therapy or&#xD;
      inability to read and write English.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation will be conducted by a web based computer programme to generate sealed opaque&#xD;
      envelopes (www.sealedenvelope.com/freerandmiser/v1) using block randomization to allow&#xD;
      periodic balancing of the 2 treatment groups. The opaque envelopes will be in a locked&#xD;
      cabinet in the charge of an administrator with no connection to the trial. The envelope will&#xD;
      be opened after initial laparoscopic survey confirms that either technique is feasible. The&#xD;
      participants will not be informed of their treatment group allocation until 1 year after&#xD;
      entry into the feasibility study. Treatment group allocation may be divulged early if&#xD;
      required by the participants General Practitioner or another clinician to facilitate the&#xD;
      participants care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomised women will receive laparoscopic hysterectomy (LH) or laparoscopic supracervical&#xD;
      hysterectomy using a standardised technique There are numerous descriptions for LSH and LH in&#xD;
      the literature. The procedures will be carried out according to the usual practise of the&#xD;
      principal investigator. A large part of both procedures are the same and will be described&#xD;
      first. General anaesthesia is induced and maintained by a single anaesthetist. A 5mm primary&#xD;
      bladeless, dilating tip trocar (Excel™, Ethicon, Cincinnati, USA) is inserted into the&#xD;
      umbilicus under direct vision. Once intraperitoneal placement is confirmed a carbon dioxide&#xD;
      pneumoperitoneum is established at a pressure of 15mmHg. The patient is placed in 45°&#xD;
      Trendelenberg and 3 accessory 5mm ports are inserted under direct vision. The position of the&#xD;
      ports are lateral at the level of the umbilicus on either side and the third 2 fingers&#xD;
      breadth above the symphysis pubis. In the case of LH all 3 accessory ports are 5 mm diameter&#xD;
      but in LSH the suprapubic port is 12mm diameter. Vapor pulse coagulation via a single use&#xD;
      Plasma Kinetic forceps (PK™ Gyrus ACMI PLC) is used to coagulate the utero-ovarian ligament&#xD;
      or the infundibulopelvic ligament if removal of the ovary is desired, after identification of&#xD;
      the position of the ureter at the pelvic brim. The uterovesical fold of peritoneum is&#xD;
      dissected with scissors and monopolar diathermy at 50W coagulation. The bladder flap is&#xD;
      reflected caudad. A posterior peritoneal flap is similarly dissected and reflected to&#xD;
      mobilise the ureters caudad. The ascending branch(es) of the uterine arteries are coagulated&#xD;
      and transected with the PK forceps. The remainder of the procedure differs according to&#xD;
      treatment allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For LH the main trunk of the uterine artery is coagulated superomedially to the course of the&#xD;
      ureter. The uterosacral ligaments are coagulated and transected close to the arch of the&#xD;
      uterosacrals. The remainder of the procedure is carried out via the vagina. Forty mls of a&#xD;
      1:200,000 adrenaline in normal saline solution is infiltrated into the subcuticular space&#xD;
      around the cervix taking care to avoid intravascular injection The cervix is circumcised with&#xD;
      a monopolar angled needle using blended diathermy of 100W cutting and 60W coagulation. The&#xD;
      supra-vaginal septum is divided to allow cranial reflection of the bladder. The Pouch of&#xD;
      Douglas is entered with a single cut into the peritoneum underlying the vaginal skin in the&#xD;
      posterior vaginal fornix. The Cardinal ligaments are clamped with curved Zeppelin clamps,&#xD;
      cut,transfixed and ligated with 1 Vicryl® (Ethicon division of Johnson &amp; Johnson, New Jersey,&#xD;
      USA) prior to removal of the uterus and cervix. The vaginal skin and peritoneum are sutured&#xD;
      en-masse with locking 1 Vicryl®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the case of LSH a 100W monopolar diathermy loop (Lap Loop™, Roberts Surgical, Worcester,&#xD;
      UK) is used to amputate the body of the uterus from the cervix. The uterus is morcellated and&#xD;
      removed piecemeal with a 15mm disposable morcellator (X-Tract™ Gynecare division of Johnson &amp;&#xD;
      Johnson, New Jersey, USA). The endocervical canal and cervical stump are coagulated with&#xD;
      bipolar diathermy. The accessory ports are removed under direct vision and in the case of LSH&#xD;
      the suprapubic port is closed with 1 Vicryl® on Endoclose® (Tyco, Hampshire UK).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The remainder of the procedure is the same for both techniques. Haemostasis is confirmed&#xD;
      laparoscopically.The pneumoperitoneum is deflated and 20 mls 2.5% chirocaine is instilled&#xD;
      intraperitoneally. The laparoscope and primary trocar are removed under direct vision. In LSH&#xD;
      the 15mm suprapubic port site is closed with 1 Vicryl® on an Endoclose™ (Tyco Healthcare,&#xD;
      Hampshire UK) needle. The skin is closed with subcuticular 3-0 Vicryl Rapide® (Ethicon). 5mls&#xD;
      2.5% chirocaine is injected subcuticularly at the port sites. The bladder catheter is removed&#xD;
      in all patients when the patient is mobile. Analgaesia is commenced per-operatively with&#xD;
      intravenous diclofenac 75 mg and paracetamol 1g together with 8 mg dexamethasone and 4mg&#xD;
      ondansetron as antiemetic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires will be administered without prior knowledge of type of hysterectomy. The&#xD;
      operating surgeon will not be involved with administering questionnaires for the duration of&#xD;
      the study. Analysis of the results will be performed without prior knowledge of treatment&#xD;
      group allocation. Participants and their GPs will be informed of treatment group at the&#xD;
      completion of the feasibility study (or sooner if requested by GP or participant who wishes&#xD;
      to drop out of the study) in order to continue on the cervical screening programme if&#xD;
      required (LSH group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The feasibility study will describe recruitment to the study and acceptability to&#xD;
      randomisation. Statistical analysis of the feasibility study results will inform power&#xD;
      calculations for the subsequent definitive study. All statistical analyses will be performed&#xD;
      using SPSS version 17 for Windows.. The QoR-40 questionnaire domains are scored on a scale&#xD;
      from 0 (worst recovery) to 200 (best recovery). The scores are compared preoperatively,&#xD;
      postoperatively and at weekly intervals up to and including 6 months using the t-test where&#xD;
      data satisfies the test of normality. Normality will be tested using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov&#xD;
      test (P value set at 0.050) and where data does not satisfy normality the Wilcoxon Signed&#xD;
      Rank Test will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CES-D questionnaire elements are scored as 0-3 with a maximum score of 60. A score of&#xD;
      over 16 indicates depression. The CES-D scores will be converted to presence or absence of&#xD;
      depression and compared between the 2 groups using the Wilcoxon Signed Rank test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The e-PAQ has 4 domains. 3 domains have 5 items and 1 domain has 4 items. Each item is scored&#xD;
      from a minimum of 0 (best possible health) to 100 (worst possible health. The preoperative&#xD;
      item scores will be compared with postoperative scores and at six months using the Wilcoxon&#xD;
      Signed Rank test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measures scores will also be analysed as above.&#xD;
