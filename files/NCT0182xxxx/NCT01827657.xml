  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-dose, open-label, two part, parallel group study. This study is being&#xD;
      conducted to determine the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of GSK2336805 in&#xD;
      subjects with varying degrees of hepatic impairment. Part 1 of the study will enroll subjects&#xD;
      with mild and moderate hepatic impairment and healthy control subjects matched to the&#xD;
      subjects in the moderate hepatic impairment category. The decision to commence Part 2 will be&#xD;
      based on a review of the preliminary safety and pharmacokinetic data from subjects with&#xD;
      moderate hepatic impairment. Part 2 will enroll subjects with severe hepatic impairment.&#xD;
      Additionally, based on emergent data from Part 1, matched controls to the severe hepatic&#xD;
      group may be enrolled (optional). Due to the potential difficulty in identifying eligible&#xD;
      subjects with severe hepatic impairment, the study may be stopped prior to full enrollment in&#xD;
      Part 2, provided that a minimum of 4 evaluable subjects with severe hepatic impairment have&#xD;
      been enrolled. The study will consist of a Screening visit, a single dose Treatment Period&#xD;
      and a Follow-up visit. Subjects will be screened for eligibility criteria within 30 days of&#xD;
      enrolment. Subjects will be admitted to the clinical unit on Day -1; each subject will&#xD;
      receive a single dose of GSK2336805 on Day 1 and will remain in the clinical unit for 5 days&#xD;
      (check-out on Day 4). The follow-up visit will be conducted within 7-10 days after Day 1&#xD;
      dosing.&#xD;
