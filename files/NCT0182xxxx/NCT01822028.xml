      Cross-over, tolerability study with healthy subjects taking Zavesca in combination with&#xD;
      Florastor. Forty-two subjects will be randomized to one of two treatment sequences of Zavesca&#xD;
      with Florastor and Zavesca with Placebo of Florastor. Gastrointestinal tolerability and PK&#xD;
      endpoints, demographic, laboratory and safety testing, and AEs and SAEs will be collected&#xD;
      throughout the seventy-four day study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, single-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, two period /&#xD;
      two treatment, cross-over study with GI tolerability, safety, and PK assessments. A total of&#xD;
      42 healthy subjects will be enrolled. At least 30% of female subjects are expected to be&#xD;
      enrolled. Subjects will participate in 2 treatment periods (Treatment Period 1 and Treatment&#xD;
      Period 2), separated by a 10- to 14-day washout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomly allocated to the treatment sequence, A-B or B-A:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment A: Placebo of S. boulardii 500 mg twice a day (b.i.d.) from Day 1 to Day 16 of&#xD;
           the treatment period, and miglustat capsules 100 mg t.i.d. from Day 3 to Day 16.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment B: S. boulardii 500 mg b.i.d. from Day 1 to Day 16 of the treatment period,&#xD;
           and miglustat capsules 100 mg t.i.d. from Day 3 to Day 16.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To minimize possible carry-over effect, a 10 to 14-day washout period is added between&#xD;
      Treatment Period 1 and Period 2. Steady-state PK evaluations will occur at the end of Period&#xD;
      1 and Period 2 requiring full-day clinic stays by each subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned study duration per subject will be approximately 46 days (not inclusive of&#xD;
      Screening and serious adverse event [SAE] follow-up periods). However, the duration may be up&#xD;
      to 53 days if all visit windows are utilized. The Screening period may last up to 30 days&#xD;
      prior to the first administration of study medication. Telephone follow-up will occur within&#xD;
      48-72 hours after last study drug dose in each treatment period to record SAEs/AEs and&#xD;
      concomitant medications. In addition, subjects will be followed up 30 days after permanent&#xD;
      study drug discontinuation for ongoing AEs and new SAEs via a telephone consult.&#xD;
