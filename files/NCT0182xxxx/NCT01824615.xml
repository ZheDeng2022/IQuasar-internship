    <textblock>
      Patients with early and advanced stages of epithelial ovarian cancer are treated with&#xD;
      postoperative systemic chemotherapy after appropriate surgical staging and cytoreductive&#xD;
      surgery. For ovarian cancer patients with recurrence, salvage chemotherapy with or without&#xD;
      secondary cytoreductive surgery are recommended. The recommendation for specific primary&#xD;
      adjuvant or salvage chemotherapy is cyclophosphamide or paclitaxel plus platinum regimens.&#xD;
      Despite the high objective response rate associated with primary chemotherapy in ovarian&#xD;
      cancer, the majority of patients will eventually experience disease recurrence and be&#xD;
      potential candidates for a second-line treatment approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ovarian clear cell adenocarcinoma (OCCA) is recognized as a distinct histological type of&#xD;
      cancer in the WHO-classification of ovarian tumors. OCCA is thought to arise from&#xD;
      endometriosis and most patients present with the disease at early stages (International&#xD;
      Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stages I and II). The incidence of OCCA among&#xD;
      epithelial ovarian cancers is estimated to be less than 5-10%. However, OCCA occurs more&#xD;
      frequent in Japan and Taiwan (around 10-15%). Unfortunately, OCCA is usually more resistant&#xD;
      to systemic chemotherapy than other types and has a poorer prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sunitinib is a small molecule with anti-tumor properties pharmacologically mediated through&#xD;
      inhibition of multiple receptor tyrosine kinase (RTKs), which are important regulators of&#xD;
      tumor cell growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Due to its multi-targeted profile, the&#xD;
      pharmacological activity of sunitinib is likely mediated by inhibition of multiple RTK&#xD;
      targets and multiple pathways. c-KIT has been implicated in mastocytosis/mast cell leukemia,&#xD;
      germ cell cancers, small-cell lung cancer, GISTs, AML, neuroblastoma, melanoma, and ovarian&#xD;
      and breast carcinoma. In addition, sunitinib has demonstrated a higher response rate than&#xD;
      that reported for anti- VEGF antibody treatment in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC).&#xD;
      A few clinical case reports indicated sunitinib is effective in treating recurrent ovarian&#xD;
      clear cell adenocarcinoma (OCCA) which is almost resistant to second line chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So we would like to conduct this Phase II Sunitinib clinical trial in recurrent / persistent&#xD;
      ovarian clear cell cancer patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ovarian cancer is the 10th leading cancer in women in Taiwan. There were 894 new cases in&#xD;
      2004 and 297 women died of ovarian cancer in 2001 according to the data released by the&#xD;
      Department of Health. The incidence of epithelial ovarian cancer increases with age and the&#xD;
      median age at the time of diagnosis is 63 years, and 70% of patients present with advanced&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary treatment for ovarian cancer consists of appropriate surgical staging and&#xD;
      cytoreductive surgery, followed in most patients by systemic chemotherapy. Initial surgery&#xD;
      should be a comprehensive staging laparotomy. For patients with clinical stage III or IV&#xD;
      disease, the usual recommendation continues to be maximally cytoreductive surgery followed by&#xD;
      adjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most patients with epithelial ovarian cancer will receive postoperative systemic&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Observation is recommended for stage Ia, grade 1 tumors, owing to their high&#xD;
      cure rate. For patients with higher-grade and/or higher-stage tumors, systemic chemotherapy&#xD;
      is indicated. The recommendation for specific primary chemotherapy/primary adjuvant therapy&#xD;
      is Paclitaxel plus platinum regimens. Paclitaxel plus cisplatin or carboplatin are the&#xD;
      recommended regimens. The extent of treatment varies with stage of disease. For patients with&#xD;
      advanced-stage disease, six cycles of chemotherapy are recommended, whereas for earlier-stage&#xD;
      disease, three to six cycles are recommended, pending the results of ongoing studies in this&#xD;
      group of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of relapsed ovarian cancer Despite the high objective response rate associated with&#xD;
      primary platinum/taxane-based chemotherapy in advanced ovarian cancer, the majority of&#xD;
      patients will eventually experience disease recurrence and be potential candidates for a&#xD;
      second-line treatment approach. Treatment options for relapsed cancer are numerous. Patients&#xD;
      with platinum-sensitive tumors (response to initial platinum therapy with no relapse for at&#xD;
      least 6 months) may be retreated with platinum agents and/or taxanes upon relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clear cell carcinomas of the ovary comprise approximately 5% of all ovarian neoplasms and&#xD;
      exhibit unique features including a more aggressive clinical course and more malignant&#xD;
      behavior. Clinically, clear cell carcinomas often present as a large pelvic mass, the&#xD;
      majority of which are detected at an early stage (FIGO stage I). Despite the early stage&#xD;
      diagnosis, survival rates are significantly lower for women with clear cell carcinoma&#xD;
      relative to stage-matched serous adenocarcinoma of the ovary. Furthermore, tumors are more&#xD;
      chemoresistant, resulting in a high degree of recurrence and exhibit more frequent early&#xD;
      metastasis to lymph nodes and parenchymal organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sunitinib is a small molecule with anti-tumor properties pharmacologically mediated through&#xD;
      inhibition of multiple receptor tyrosine kinase (RTKs), which are important regulators of&#xD;
      tumor cell growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Specifically, sunitinib is a potent&#xD;
      ATP-competitive inhibitor of the catalytic activity of a group of closely related RTKs&#xD;
      consisting of VEGFR-1, -2, and -3, PDGFR-α and -β, KIT, CSF-1R, FLT-3, and RET. Due to its&#xD;
      multi-targeted profile, the pharmacological activity of sunitinib is likely mediated by&#xD;
      inhibition of multiple RTK targets and multiple pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we would like to evaluated the effect of Sunitinib in recurrent / persisted&#xD;
      ovarian clear cell carcinoma.&#xD;
