  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical benefits of VR analgesia have been empirically demonstrated as either an alternative&#xD;
      or in combination with opioids. Issues of cost, ergonomics, and maintenance of the hardware&#xD;
      systems have limited the wider use of this benefit to the public. Firsthand Technology has&#xD;
      designed a system to meet the performance requirements for high levels of pain control in a&#xD;
      durable, ergonomic package at a greatly reduced cost compared to the current systems in use.&#xD;
      This study will validate the new system by running a thermal pain study that tests the effect&#xD;
      of the new system (ID) compared to the established standard helmet currently used.&#xD;

      This project compares the analgesic effect of the immersive Virtual Reality delivery method,&#xD;
      the Firsthand ID, to the current standard of care HMD systems in a laboratory thermal pain&#xD;
      test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background and Significance- Although advances in medicine have lead to the development of&#xD;
      numerous opioid analgesics, excess procedural pain continues to be a major point of concern&#xD;
      for patients and health professionals in a clinical setting.1 Pharmacological analgesics, for&#xD;
      treatment of acute pain, are unpopular among many patients due to the potential side effects,&#xD;
      most commonly nausea, cognitive dysfunction, and constipation. 2 Within the past 10-15 years&#xD;
      immersion immersive virtual reality (VR) distraction therapy has been employed to reduce&#xD;
      procedural pain for burn victims with relative success. 3 Patients treated with VR along with&#xD;
      standard medications reported reduction in pain and reduced time spent thinking about the&#xD;
      pain during procedures. 4 In laboratory studies using functional neuroimaging (fMRI),&#xD;
      subjects reporting pain reduction while using VR therapy, are also seen demonstrating a&#xD;
      decrease in pain-related brain activity. 5 VR is believed to be effective based on gate&#xD;
      theory of cognitive load, due to the fact that a person can only process a finite amount of&#xD;
      incoming information and conscious attention is needed to perceive pain. 1,6 Consistent with&#xD;
      this idea of the amount of information being an important factor in effectiveness, it has&#xD;
      been shown that High-Tech-VR (60 degree field-of-view, user interactivity, sound effects, and&#xD;
      head tracking) devices are more effective at analgesic therapy than is a Low-Tech-VR system&#xD;
      (35 degree field-of-view, lack of: interactivity, sound effects and head tracking).1 More&#xD;
      recently studies have shown that interactivity is an important factor of VR responsible for&#xD;
      decreasing both pain unpleasantness and time spent thinking about pain, while increasing fun.&#xD;
      7 Interactivity is said to increase immersion into the VR world. 7 VR immersion, as defined&#xD;
      by Slater and Wilber, is an objective, quantifiable description of the sensory input that a&#xD;
      VR system can deliver to a subject. 8 This is a distinct entity separate from presence, which&#xD;
      is the subjective psychological illusion of the world created in the users mind. 8.&#xD;
      Increasing immersion facilitates a stronger illusion of presence and serves as a subsequent&#xD;
      greater distractor effect thus, decreasing perception of the painful stimuli.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A major obstacle to the wider testing and proliferation of the potential benefits of VR&#xD;
      analgesia is due to the excessive cost and technical limitations of immersive display&#xD;
      hardware, specifically head-mounted displays (HMDs). Firsthand has developed an arm-mounted&#xD;
      high resolution 3D display, the Firsthand ID, which delivers a high quality image and&#xD;
      immersive experience at significant cost savings compared to the current standard of care&#xD;
      using HMDs. This project proposes a scientific feasibility study to compare the analgesic&#xD;
      effect of the Firsthand ID to the current standard of care HMD systems in a laboratory&#xD;
      thermal pain test.&#xD;
