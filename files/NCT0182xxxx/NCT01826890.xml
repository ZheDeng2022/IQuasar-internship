  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many patients admitted to intensive care have heart or lung problems. Patients with these&#xD;
      conditions often require longer durations of support from breathing machines. Survival and&#xD;
      long-term recovery are improved if the investigators can remove the breathing support&#xD;
      quickly. In this study, the investigators will focus on patients with severe lung or heart&#xD;
      disease to examine whether a particular type of breathing machine (NAVA ventilator) will&#xD;
      allow us to remove breathing support more quickly and with less need for sedative&#xD;
      medications, when compared to current practice.&#xD;

      In this study, we will compare the use of Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist technology&#xD;
      (the NAVA ventilation mode and the monitoring capabilities) against standard care in patients&#xD;
      who are at risk of prolonged periods of mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study aim&#xD;
&#xD;
      To inform the design of a definitive randomised controlled trial (RCT) by undertaking&#xD;

    <description>Following randomisation, a NAVA catheter will be introduced. The Electrical Activity of the Diaphragm (EAdi) will be viewed primarily to ensure a minimum level of diaphragm activation during the weaning phase. NAVA mode suitability/safety assessments will be conducted in all patients prior to the first initiation of the NAVA mode. The NAVA preview function on the Maquet Servo-i ventilators will be used to transfer from the previous mode to the NAVA mode, and the assessment will last for a maximum of 30 minutes. We are recommending the use of the NAVA ventilation mode during the weaning period. Following the commencement of weaning, sedation holds and spontaneous breathing trials will be conducted according to local protocols.</description>

    <description>A NAVA catheter will be inserted following randomisation. The NAVA capabilities of the ventilator will be disabled. Patients will be ventilated according to local weaning protocol as per current standard care with either Pressure Support, Synchronised Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation, Volume Controlled Ventilation, Pressure Controlled Ventilation or Pressure Regulated Volume Controlled Ventilation. Following the commencement of weaning, sedation holds and spontaneous breathing trials will be conducted according to local protocols.</description>
