    <textblock>
      40 consecutive adult patients, requiring the insertion of dental implants in the aesthetic&#xD;
      area (from second premolar to second premolar) will be enrolled in the study. At the time of&#xD;
      surgery, a full thickness flap will be elevated, the implant bed will be prepared according&#xD;
      to the manufacturer's instruction and the implants will be then seated into the bone. T0&#xD;
      corresponds to the time of implant insertion, T1 to the time of healing abutment's connection&#xD;
      (T0=T1 for single stage implants), and T2 corresponds to 1-year follow-up from healing&#xD;
      abutment's connection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) scans will be taken immediately after abutment&#xD;
      connection (T1) and 1-year after (T2). The midsagittal cut of each implant will be&#xD;
      identified, and measurements will be made at predetermined levels. Horizontal facial bone&#xD;
      thickness (HFBT) and Vertical facial bone level (VFBL) will be measured. HFBT will be&#xD;
      measured at 0, 3, 6 and 9 mm apical to the implant platform. VFBL wil be the perpendicular&#xD;
      distance from the implant platform to the most coronal point of the facial bone. Changes&#xD;
      between T1 and T2 will be calculated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The long term results and benefit of implant insertion in the aesthetic area have been well&#xD;
      documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the past few years, facial dimensional changes to the alveolar process following implant&#xD;
      placement are object os study for both humans and animals investigations Recent studies&#xD;
      suggest that platform switching decreases bone loss by 30% to 50%. It seems that the creation&#xD;
      of a biologic width affects peri-implant bone loss to a significant extent and that platform&#xD;
      switching is effective when the mucosal thickness allows the establishment of an horizontal&#xD;
      biologic width.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new implant with an hybrid surface (T3) has been recently launched by Biomet 3i.Aim of the&#xD;
      present study will be to evaluate the degree of 3D marginal bone remodelling around T3&#xD;
      Prevail implants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS &amp; METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      40 consecutive adult patients, requiring the insertion of dental implants in the aesthetic&#xD;
      area (from second premolar to second premolar) will be enrolled in the study. At the time of&#xD;
      surgery, a full thickness flap will be elevated, the implant bed will be prepared according&#xD;
      to the manufacturer's instruction and the implants will be then seated into the bone.&#xD;
      Implants can be placed both with a single-stage or two-stage procedure. Implants inserted&#xD;
      with a two-stage procedure will be re-opened after a submerged period of three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T0 corresponds to the time of implant insertion, T1 to the time of healing abutment's&#xD;
      connection (T0=T1 for single stage implants), and T2 corresponds to 1-year follow-up from&#xD;
      healing abutment's connection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is supposed that the creation of the biological width starts with the healing abutment's&#xD;
      connection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CBCT scans will be taken immediately after abutment connection (T1) and 1-year after (T2).&#xD;
      The midsagittal cut of each implant will be identified, and measurements will be made at&#xD;
      predetermined levels. Horizontal facial bone thickness (HFBT) and Vertical facial bone level&#xD;
      (VFBL) will be measured. HFBT will be measured at 0, 3, 6 and 9 mm apical to the implant&#xD;
      platform. VFBL wil be the perpendicular distance from the implant platform to the most&#xD;
      coronal point of the facial bone. Changes between T1 and T2 will be calculated.&#xD;
