    <textblock>
      Bone disease in multiple myeloma (MM) is routinely assessed by skeletal X-ray (XR) and&#xD;
      magnetic resonance of the spine (S-MRI). Diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) is a functional MRI&#xD;
      that detects water diffusion through cells. This prospective phase II study compared&#xD;
      whole-body DW-MRI with XR and S-MRI for the assessment of MM bone lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS. Thirty-six consecutive symptomatic patients at diagnosis or at relapse performed XR,&#xD;
      S-MRI, whole-body MRI, and whole-body DW-MRI before treatment, after treatment, and 6 months&#xD;
      after treatment. A substudy evaluated 12 asymptomatic patients at diagnosis, after 6 and 12&#xD;
      months. Radiology exams were independently read by 3 experienced radiologists, and the&#xD;
      techniques were compared by the count of segments with focal lesions (FL) (&gt;=5mm).&#xD;

      PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS -&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Type Monocentric prospective clinical trial Study Object Comparison of Whole Body&#xD;
      Diffusion Weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DW-MRI) with skeletal X-Ray and MRI of the&#xD;
      spine for the assessment of bone disease in Multiple Myeloma (MM) Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective 1) To assess whether DW-MRI can detect a higher number of bone lesions than&#xD;
      standard X-Ray and MRI of the spine in Stage I-III symptomatic MM patients Secondary&#xD;
      objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess whether the change in the number of lesions detected with DW-MRI at follow up&#xD;
           correlate with disease response to therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess whether the change in the number of lesions detected with DW-MRI at follow up&#xD;
           correlate with time to re-treatment (TTR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess whether DW-MRI detects a higher number of bone lesions than Whole Body&#xD;
           Magnetic Resonance Imaging (WB-MRI) Exploratory objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) To assess whether DW-MRI detects more bone lesions than standard X-Ray and MRI of the&#xD;
      spine in Stage I asymptomatic MM patients at diagnosis not requiring treatment Study&#xD;
      population and design The study population consists consecutive Stage I-III (Durie and&#xD;
      Salmon) symptomatic Multiple Myeloma at the start of the first-line treatment or at relapse&#xD;
      after disease response (CR or PR) lasting at least 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will perform a DW-MRI, a whole body MRI (WB-MRI), a MRI of the spine and a plain&#xD;
      skeletal X-Ray with clinical and laboratory evaluations with the following timing:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients at first-line treatment for MM:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Within 15 days before the start of the treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Within one month after the end of the first-line treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. 6 months after the end of the first-line treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients at relapse after disease response (CR or PR) lasting at least 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. At relapse&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Within 15 days after the end of the treatment of relapse&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. 6 months after the end of the treatment of relapse The DW-MRI, WB-MRI and MRI of&#xD;
                the spine will be performed in the same session. Each DW-MRI, WB-MRI, MRI of the&#xD;
                spine and skeletal X-Ray will be independently read and interpreted by two&#xD;
                radiologists with proven experience in MM. Each radiologist will read and interpret&#xD;
                the exams performed; the lecture of each exam will be blinded; the identity of the&#xD;
                patient and the result of the lecture by the other radiologist will be blinded. In&#xD;
                case the number of lesions detected by the radiologists would not match, the number&#xD;
                of lesions will be determined by consensus between the radiologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of more bone lesions detected by DW-MRI compared to MRI and skeletal X-Ray, a PET&#xD;
      scan will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size The trial is designed to demonstrate a 30% increase in the number of bone lesions&#xD;
      detected by DW MRI (experimental method) as compared to standard X-Ray and MRI of the spine&#xD;
      (standard method). To detect such an effect size with a one sided Student t test at the 5%&#xD;
      significance and 90% power, 27 patients need to be investigated, that we round to 30 to&#xD;
      account for a 10% patient drop out. A midcourse sample size reassessment according to the&#xD;
      approach proposed by Proschan, Liu &amp; Hunsberger (2003) will use interim data from the first&#xD;
      20 patients to decide to either maintain or increase the original sample size in a range&#xD;
      between 30 and 60 patients, depending on whether the estimated effect size is aligned or not&#xD;
      with the anticipated value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substudy The substudy for the assessment of the exploratory objective will enroll 10&#xD;
      consecutive Stage I (Durie and Salmon) asymptomatic MM patients at diagnosis not requiring&#xD;
      treatment. The patients will perform the radiological and laboratory evaluations at diagnosis&#xD;
      and at 6 and 12 months after diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration The estimated duration of enrolment ranges between 15 and 30 months. The&#xD;
      follow up duration is 6 months. The estimated total duration of the study is 3 years. A&#xD;
      midcourse assessment of interim data is planned at the end of the first phase of enrolment&#xD;
      (20 patients) to determine the sample size of the second phase.&#xD;
