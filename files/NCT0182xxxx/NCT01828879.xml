    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tacrolimus ointment in&#xD;
      treating the signs and symptoms of moderate (medium level of seriousness) to severe (very&#xD;
      serious, life threatening) atopic dermatitis (an intensely pruritic [itching], chronic&#xD;
      [lasting a long time], inflammatory [pain and swelling], immunologically based skin disease&#xD;
      with a genetic predisposition [latent susceptibility to disease at the genetic level]) in&#xD;
      adult participants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), prospective (study&#xD;
      following participants forward in time), randomized (like the flip of a coin), multi-center&#xD;
      study in adult participants with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Participants will be&#xD;
      treated with 0.1 percent concentration of tacrolimus ointment which will be applied twice&#xD;
      daily for 4 weeks or until 1 week after the affected areas defined for treatment at baseline&#xD;
      are completely cleared, whichever is first. The study will consist of 6 visits: pre-study&#xD;
      (optional), Baseline or Day 1, Weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4 (end-of-treatment). The ointment should be&#xD;
      applied at least 2 hours before or at least 30 minutes after bathing, showering, shaving, use&#xD;
      of sauna, or heavy exercise (i.e. causes sweating). On study visit days, the ointment should&#xD;
      be applied at least 2 hours before the visit. Efficacy evaluation will be done at all&#xD;
      subsequent study visits in participants receiving study drug for at least 3 consecutive days&#xD;
      (minimum of 5 applications) while the participants who will receive at least 1 application of&#xD;
      the study drug, will be evaluated for safety. Primary efficacy evaluation will be based on&#xD;
      the Physician's Global Evaluation of Clinical Response (PhGECR). Participants' safety will be&#xD;
      monitored throughout the study.&#xD;

    <description>PhGECR scale evaluates the change in the lesions of atopic dermatitis, which is defined as the lesions identified by Investigator for treatment at Baseline only, using scores ranging from, less than 0 to 100: wherein, less than 0=worse, 0-29=no appreciable improvement, 30-49=slight improvement, 50-74=moderate improvement, 75-89=marked improvement, 90-99=excellent improvement and 100=cleared.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1, 2, 3 and 4</time_frame>
    <description>A composite index of area involved and severity of the signs of atopic dermatitis in the 4 regions (head and neck, upper limbs, trunk, lower limbs) will be calculated using the physician's assessment of individual signs using a scale ranging from 0 to 3: 0=absent, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe; and the affected area assessment (the percentage of body surface area affected by atopic dermatitis) of the lesions defined in the baseline treatment area will be estimated by the physician on the basis of area score ranging from 0 to 6: 0=0 percent and 6=90 to 100 percent.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Participant's Assessment of Treatment Effects</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1, 2, 3 and 4</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will make 2 assessments at each study visit (before and after treatment) based on all affected areas (ratio of 100 percent). The assessment rates include: much better, better, slightly better, same, slightly worse, worse. Much better and better is considered good.</description>
