      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of tretinoin when given together&#xD;
      with lithium carbonate in treating patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid&#xD;
      leukemia. Lithium carbonate may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the&#xD;
      enzymes needed for cell growth. Tretinoin may help [type of cancer] cells become more like&#xD;
      normal cells, and to grow and spread more slowly. Giving lithium carbonate together with&#xD;
      tretinoin may kill more cancer cells&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose of the combination of tretinoin with&#xD;
      lithium carbonate in subjects with non promyelocytic acute myeloid leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe the dose limiting toxicities associated with the combination of lithium&#xD;
      (lithium carbonate) and tretinoin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the ability of lithium to inhibit glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) activity&#xD;
      in circulating acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells and to enhance the retinoic acid receptor&#xD;
      expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the ability of lithium and tretinoin to induce differentiation and/or&#xD;
      growth inhibition of AML cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine the response rate of acute myeloid treatment to treatment with the&#xD;
      combination of Tretinoin and Lithium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of tretinoin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive tretinoin orally (PO) every 12 hours on days 1-7 and 15-21 and lithium&#xD;
      carbonate PO three times daily (TID) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to&#xD;
      6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  There is no exclusion for the presence of cytopenias&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of tretinoin and lithium on the developing human fetus are unknown; for&#xD;
             this reason and because retinoid agents as well as other therapeutic agents used in&#xD;
             this study are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must&#xD;
             agree to use adequate contraception (double barrier method of birth control or&#xD;
             abstinence) from the time of study entry, for the duration of study participation and&#xD;
             for 3 months after completing treatment; should a woman become pregnant or suspect&#xD;
             that she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she&#xD;
             should inform the treating physician immediately&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written&#xD;
             informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment toxicities must be resolved to ≤ grade 1 according to National Cancer&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients who are currently receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with untreated central nervous system involvement by AML should be excluded&#xD;
             from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often&#xD;
             develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of&#xD;
             neurologic and other adverse events; this is an uncommon situation in AML and&#xD;
             therefore a lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling or magnetic&#xD;
             resonance imaging (MRI) imaging are Not necessary to rule out central nervous system&#xD;
             (CNS) involvement in the absence of clinical suspicion by the treating physician&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Tetracycline and its derivatives (enhance the risk of retinoic acid toxicity)&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  CYP2C8 inducers: rifampicin&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients receiving any medications or substances that are moderate and strong&#xD;
                  inhibitors of CYP2C8 or inducers of CYP2C8 are ineligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing&#xD;
             or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,&#xD;
             cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit&#xD;
             compliance with study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding women are excluded from this study because tretinoin is a&#xD;
             retinoid derivative agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects;&#xD;
             because there is an unknown, but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants&#xD;
             secondary to treatment of the mother with tretinoin, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued if the mother is treated with tretinoin; these potential risks may also&#xD;
             apply to other agents used in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral&#xD;
             therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with&#xD;
             tretinoin; in addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when&#xD;
             treated with marrow suppressive therapy; appropriate studies will be undertaken in&#xD;
             patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic active hepatitis B or C infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous diagnosis of bipolar disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known hypersensitivity to lithium or tretinoin&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Personal or family history of established Brugada syndrome; if pre-enrollment&#xD;
             electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrates abnormal findings (ST elevation in precordial&#xD;
             leads), cardiology consultation should be obtained to rule out presence of this&#xD;
             inherited syndrome; patients with family history of unexplained sudden death before&#xD;
             the age 45 years; personal history of unexplained syncope or history of unexplained&#xD;
             ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation should have a cardiology evaluation to rule&#xD;
             out the diagnosis of Brugada syndrome&#xD;
