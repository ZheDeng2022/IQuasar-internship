  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and efficacy of a noninvasive cortical&#xD;
      electrostimulation therapy known as &quot;Reduced Impedance Noninvasive Cortical&#xD;
      Electrostimulation&quot; (RINCE) in the management of fibromyalgia. Patients who meet the 1990&#xD;
      American College of Rheumatology criteria for fibromyalgia will receive up to 24 RINCE&#xD;
      treatments delivered by a medical device called &quot;NeuroPoint&quot;. Approximately 45 fibromyalgia&#xD;
      patients will be randomized into one of three study groups. One of these groups will receive&#xD;
      sham treatment, meaning they will receive no treatment at all, while the remaining two groups&#xD;
      will receive different amounts of RINCE therapy. The study's primary outcome measure will be&#xD;
      the patient's change from baseline in self-reported 24-hour average pain intensity. The&#xD;
      study's hypothesis is that there will be a difference between treatment groups in primary&#xD;
      outcome measure.&#xD;
