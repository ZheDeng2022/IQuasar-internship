    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the clinical outcomes of open-flap (OF) and flapless (FL)&#xD;
      esthetic crown lengthening (ECL) for the treatment of excessive gingival display (EGD). It&#xD;
      was hypothesized that the FL surgery would yield similar clinical results to the OF technique&#xD;
      up to 12 months. Methods: A split-mouth randomized controlled trial will be conducted in 28&#xD;
      subjects presenting EGD. Contralateral quadrants will receive ECL using OF or FL techniques.&#xD;
      Clinical parameters will be evaluated at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months post-surgeries. The&#xD;
      local levels of receptor activator of NF-КB ligand (RANKL) and osteoprotegerin (OPG) will be&#xD;
      assessed by ELISA at baseline and 3 months. Patients' perceptions regarding morbidity and&#xD;
      esthetical appearance will be also evaluated. Periodontal tissue dimensions will be obtained&#xD;
      by computed tomography at baseline and correlated with the changes in the gingival margin&#xD;
      (GM).&#xD;

      Experimental design and treatment protocols&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this prospective, split-mouth, randomized controlled clinical study, 28 subjects (21 - 40&#xD;
      years old) requiring correction of EGD will received ECL using OF and FL techniques. A&#xD;
      computer-generated table randomly distributed the right quadrant to receive OF or FL&#xD;
      techniques. Consequently, the contralateral left quadrant was allocated to the other group.&#xD;
      The following treatments were performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      OF (control group; n=28 sides/105 teeth): An internal beveled incision was performed at the&#xD;
      buccal aspect of the involved teeth. Afterwards, a sulcular incision was completed to allow&#xD;
      gingival tissue removal. A full-thickness mucoperiosteal flap was reflected to remove and&#xD;
      remodel bone tissue by means of surgical chisels, as necessary, until a 3mm distance was&#xD;
      achieved between the bone crest and the cement-enamel junction (CEJ). The exposed root&#xD;
      surfaces were carefully planed with curettes. Interrupted sutures were performed at the&#xD;
      papilla to allow GM stabilization in the CEJ position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FL (test group; n=28 sides/105 teeth): Internal beveled and sulcular incisions and gingival&#xD;
      tissue removal were performed as above described for the control group, replacing the GM in&#xD;
      the CEJ position. However, the alveolar bone was removed and remodeled, as necessary, using&#xD;
      micro chisels, via incisions, without flap elevation. The root surfaces were also carefully&#xD;
      planed via incisions. The required distance of 3mm between the bone crest and the CEJ was&#xD;
      checked by inserting a periodontal probe into the incision. Sutures were not performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After both procedures, canines and central incisors should be at the same length, and the&#xD;
      lateral incisor should be 1mm shorter. The same periodontist (F.R.V.) performed all&#xD;
      surgeries. Chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwash (0.12%) was prescribed 2x/day for 2 weeks.&#xD;
      Analgesics were prescribed to control possible postoperative discomfort. The sutures of&#xD;
      control quadrants were removed after 7 days. The surgical time for test and control, starting&#xD;
      after anesthesia, was computed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examiner calibration&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical examinations were performed by one trained examiner (D.H.), calibrated as previously&#xD;
      described13. The intra-examiner variability was 0.16 mm for PD and 0.18 mm for CAL. The&#xD;
      parameters registered dichotomously (e.g. BoP) were calculated by the Kappa-Light test and&#xD;
      the intra-examiner agreement was &gt; 0.85.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periodontal measurements were performed using a manual probe . An individual stent of&#xD;
      ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer was used as a reference point for some clinical parameters.&#xD;
      Grooves were drilled in the stent to standardize the localization and direction of the probe.&#xD;
      The following parameters were assessed on the mesio-buccal, middle-buccal and disto-buccal&#xD;
      aspect of all included teeth at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months post-surgeries: plaque&#xD;
      accumulation (PI)12; MB: bleeding up to 15 seconds after probing along GM; BoP: bleeding up&#xD;
      to 15 seconds after probing, at least 1 min following MB recording; PD: distance between the&#xD;
      GM and the bottom of the gingival sulcus; Relative GM (rGM): distance from a fixed landmark&#xD;
      in the stent to the most cervical point of the GM; Relative CAL (rCAL): distance from a fixed&#xD;
      landmark in the stent to the bottom of the gingival sulcus; Keratinized gingiva height (KGH):&#xD;
      distance from the GM to the mucogingival line. rGM was also assessed immediately after&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relative bone level (rBL, i.e. the distance between a fixed landmark in the stent and the&#xD;
      bone crest [BC]) was recorded before and after the surgical procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the effects of surgeries on alveolar bone remodeling, the gingival crevicular&#xD;
      fluid (GCF) levels of receptor activator of NF-КB ligand (RANKL) and osteoprotegerin (OPG)&#xD;
      were assessed. One site from each quadrant was randomly chosen for GCF sampling at baseline&#xD;
      and at 3 months post-surgeries. The GCF sampling protocol and volume measurement were&#xD;
      performed as previously described14. The strips were stored at -80ºC for subsequent assays.&#xD;
      GCF samples were analyzed by ELISA for soluble RANKL (sRANKL) and OPG using commercially&#xD;
      available ELISA kits , according to the manufacturer's recommendations14. Results were&#xD;
      reported as total amount (pg) and concentration (pg/µl of GCF) of protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT)&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the hard and soft tissues of the buccal periodontal apparatus, a soft tissue CBCT&#xD;
      (ST-CBCT) was performed as previously described15. At baseline, the CBCT scans were taken&#xD;
      with an iCATǁ and the images (sections of 1.0 mm apart) were acquired using suitable&#xD;
      software. Briefly, the individuals were submitted to a regular CBCT scan, wearing a plastic&#xD;
      lip retractor in an inverted position and retracting their tongues toward the floor of the&#xD;
      mouth. These procedures prevented the interference of the soft tissues of the lips, cheeks&#xD;
      and tongue in the gingival tissue. The following measurements were obtained in the buccal&#xD;
      aspect of the middle image section of each tooth with a digital caliper rule: bone thickness&#xD;
      (BT, the width of the buccal bone at a distance of 3 mm apical to the bone crest), CEJ to BC&#xD;
      distance (CEJ-BC), gingival thickness (GT, the width of the buccal gingival tissue at a&#xD;
      distance of 3 mm apical to the bone crest), GM to BC distance (GM-BC) and CEJ to GM distance&#xD;
      (CEJ-GM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient perceptions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient perceptions regarding morbidity and esthetic satisfaction were evaluated with a&#xD;
      questionnaire administered by an assistant (TSM). The questionnaire was obtained upon&#xD;
      completion of the procedure (pain) and at 7 days (pain/discomfort, swelling, hematoma,&#xD;
      esthetical appearance) and 6 months post-surgery (esthetical appearance). Responses were&#xD;
      quantified with a visual analogue scale (VAS) of 100 mm in which 0 indicated 'no' and 100&#xD;
      'plenty.' In addition, at 7 days and 6 months post-surgery, a questionnaire recorded patient&#xD;
      satisfaction regarding the type of treatment, in terms of esthetical appearance by selecting&#xD;
      one of the following choices: totally satisfied, partially satisfied or unsatisfied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      To validate the clinical comparisons of this paper, a post hoc power calculation was&#xD;
      performed based on differences of 0.5mm in GM between groups at 12 months post-surgery. Since&#xD;
      there is no previous study comparing OF and FL techniques, we established that a difference&#xD;
      of 0.5mm in GM between both approaches could be a relevant clinical parameter to perform the&#xD;
      power size calculation. In addition, a standard deviation (SD) of 0.5 mm was determined based&#xD;
      on the observed SD of the difference in GM changes between groups at 12 months, considering&#xD;
      all buccal sites (interproximal- plus middle-buccal sites). Based on these data, it was&#xD;
      determined that 16 subjects per group would be necessary to provide an 80% power with an&#xD;
      alpha of 0.05. Since 28 subjects met the inclusion criteria, these were all included in the&#xD;
      study. The power calculation took into account the split-mouth design16.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data were examined for normality by the Shapiro-Wilk test. The data that did not achieve&#xD;
      normality were analyzed using non-parametric methods. The mean percentage of sites with&#xD;
      visible plaque accumulation, MB, BoP and the mean PD, rGM, rCAL, KGH and rBL were computed,&#xD;
      separately, for interproximal- and middle-buccal sites of control and test sides.&#xD;
      Interproximal sites included the mean of mesio- and disto-buccal measurements. The changes in&#xD;
      the rGM from baseline to immediately after surgery, 3, 6 and 12 months and in rBL from&#xD;
      baseline to immediately after surgery were calculated for both groups. Clinical differences&#xD;
      between groups were compared using the paired Student's t-test. Repeated measures ANOVA and&#xD;
      Tukey test were employed to detect differences within each group among time-points. The&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney test was used to evaluate VAS scores of patient's perceptions. The satisfaction&#xD;
      in terms of esthetical appearance was compared by the χ2test. RANKL and OPG differences&#xD;
      between groups and time-points were compared using the Wilcoxon test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A model of multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis was performed to estimate the&#xD;
      association between the dimensions of the soft and bone tissues obtained by ST-CBCT, the&#xD;
      treatment modalities and the changes in the GM. The outcome variable in this model was the&#xD;
      nonappearance of creeping attachment of the GM in a coronal direction, at 12 months, from the&#xD;
      position defined immediately after surgery (yes/no). The predictor variables included the&#xD;
      surgical modalities and the tomography measurements. The level of significance was set at 5%&#xD;
      for all analyses.&#xD;
