  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial studies two different tests that are currently being used to&#xD;
      detect the spread of breast cancer to the lymph nodes under the arm in candidates for breast&#xD;
      conservation therapy. The two tests are sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and axillary&#xD;
      ultrasound. The current standard of care is sentinel lymph node biopsy, which is a surgical&#xD;
      procedure. Axillary ultrasound (AUS) may be just as good as SLNB for detecting the spread of&#xD;
      cancer but without the surgical risks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective randomized non-inferiority study we aim to determine the utility of&#xD;
      axillary ultrasound (AUS) as a pre-operative staging modality for patients with clinically&#xD;
      node-negative invasive breast cancer with the hope that it will be a minimally invasive&#xD;
      replacement for SLNB.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must be female.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must be at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient's clinical stage must be documented as tumor size less than 5 cm, with no&#xD;
             palpable nodes and no evidence of metastatic disease (T1 or T2 N0 M0). For patients&#xD;
             who will receive neoadjuvant systemic therapy, pre-treatment clinical stage should be&#xD;
             used.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must have a negative (normal) axillary ultrasound performed at Siteman Cancer&#xD;
             Center. Lymph nodes will be evaluated based on morphologic features. AUS wil be&#xD;
             considered positive (abnormal)if lymph nodes are noted to be completely hypoechoic&#xD;
             (absent hilum) or have focal hypoechoic cortical thickening/lobulation greater than 4&#xD;
             mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must have a tissue diagnosis of invasive breast carcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) status &lt;/= 2, as&#xD;
             documented in patient's medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must be available for follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A patient with a history of previous malignancy is eligible for this study as long as&#xD;
             the patient meets the following criteria for a cancer survivor. A cancer survivor is&#xD;
             eligible provided that the following criteria are met (1) The patient has undergone&#xD;
             potentially curative therapy for all prior malignancies; (2) There has been no&#xD;
             evidence of any prior malignancies for at least five years with no evidence of&#xD;
             recurrence (except for effectively treated basal cell or squamous carcinoma of the&#xD;
             skin, carcinoma in-situ of the cervix that has been effectively treated by surgery&#xD;
             alone, or lobular carcinoma in-situ of the ipsilateral or contralateral breast treated&#xD;
             by surgery alone); and (3) The patient is deemed by their treating physician to be at&#xD;
             low risks for recurrence from prior malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient, or the patient's legally acceptable representative, must provide a signed and&#xD;
             dated written informed consent prior to registration and any study-related procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must provide written authorization to allow the use and disclosure of their&#xD;
             protected health information. NOTE: This may be obtained in either the study-specific&#xD;
             informed consent or in a separate authorization form and must be obtained from the&#xD;
             patient prior to study registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must be a candidate for sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient in lactating (breast-feeding) or pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has concurrent invasive bilateral breast malignancies or multicentric disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has had previous ipsilateral axillary surgery such as excisional biopsy of&#xD;
             lymph nodes(s), treatment of hidradenitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is considered poor candidate surgical candidate due to non-malignant systemic&#xD;
             disease.&#xD;
