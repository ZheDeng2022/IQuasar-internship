      A randomized controlled trial will be conducted to assess the effectiveness of conditional&#xD;
      cash transfers (CCTs) at increasing retention in prevention of mother-to-child transmission&#xD;
      (PMTCT) services specifically, in relation to pickup of ARV drugs for infected mothers,&#xD;
      delivery in the hospital setting, and receipt of drugs for exposed infants. Administrative&#xD;
      data will be extracted from the All Babies are Equal program and hospital records. At 8-10&#xD;
      weeks after delivery, an endline survey will also be conducted with each participant to&#xD;
      provide a deeper understanding of the impact of the CCTs and to assess the reasons for&#xD;
      retention in PMTCT services.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nigeria, home to only 2% of the world's population, accounts for 30% of the world's&#xD;
      mother-to-child transmissions of HIV. Over the past three years, and in collaboration with&#xD;
      bilateral aid agencies, the Nigerian government has strengthened hundreds of free rural&#xD;
      clinics, trained thousands of birth attendants, and begun free distribution of antiretroviral&#xD;
      (ARV) drugs. Despite this, only 1.8% of low-income women deliver a baby with a skilled birth&#xD;
      attendant, only 16% of HIV-positive pregnant women receive ARVs to prevent mother-to-child&#xD;
      transmission (PMTCT) of HIV, and only 2.3% of infants born to HIV-infected women received ARV&#xD;
      prophylaxis to reduce the risk of virus transmission. Pregnant women are lost at each step&#xD;
      along the PMTCT cascade, from attending a prenatal visit to giving life-saving antiretroviral&#xD;
      therapy to their newborns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operated by New Incentives, a non-profit organization focused on maternal and child health,&#xD;
      the All Babies are Equal (ABAE) program was established in June 2014 in Akwa Ibom to improve&#xD;
      utilization of health services for PMTCT. The ABAE program provides conditional cash&#xD;
      transfers (CCTs) to pregnant, HIV-positive women conditional on obtaining specific ante-,&#xD;
      peri-, and postnatal services at public facilities to prevent mother-to-child transmission of&#xD;
      HIV. The CCT is primarily a demand-side intervention that aims to reduce the barriers that&#xD;
      women may face when seeking care, as well as encourage uptake of and retention in PMTCT&#xD;
      services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A large body of evidence indicates that providing ARV drugs to HIV-positive pregnant women&#xD;
      during pregnancy and at the time of birth to both mother and baby can drastically reduce the&#xD;
      transmission of the virus to the newborn. However, in Nigeria, even though drugs for PMTCT&#xD;
      are free and available, many women do not use them. Additionally, knowledge of&#xD;
      mother-to-child transmission of HIV and PMTCT is high among the investigators' target&#xD;
      population. Recent research shows that 91% of women of reproductive age have high awareness&#xD;
      of PMTCT in southern Nigeria, yet 71% have poor attitudes towards PMTCT treatment and&#xD;
      services, resulting in low uptake of services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To encourage uptake of PMTCT services, the ABAE's CCT program was designed based on research&#xD;
      that has shown that CCT interventions have increased utilization of health services and&#xD;
      improve child health. CCTs initially used in Latin America provided predictable sums of money&#xD;
      to eligible mothers when certain actions were taken, particularly for health services and&#xD;
      school enrollment. The cash payouts have been shown to alleviate short- and long-term poverty&#xD;
      while building human capital among traditionally underserved populations (i.e. women and&#xD;
      children in impoverished households). CCTs have also been effective for HIV prevention. For&#xD;
      example, in Malawi, schoolgirls (aged 13 to 22) awarded between one and five dollars for&#xD;
      attending school had significantly reduced prevalence of HIV and HSV-2 infection after 18&#xD;
      months. Additionally, several studies have shown that CCTs are an effective way to improve&#xD;
      both access and adherence to antiretroviral therapy and to reduce barriers to maternal and&#xD;
      newborn health service utilization. A CCT program targeted at increasing births in health&#xD;
      facilities in India found a significant increase in uptake of antenatal and intrapartum care&#xD;
      services and an increase in facility-based deliveries. As studies continue to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of CCTs, ongoing efforts aim to determine the impact of these interventions on&#xD;
      transmission of HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to formally evaluate the ABAE program for increasing retention of&#xD;
      HIV-positive pregnant women in PMTCT through a randomized control trial. Through a&#xD;
      combination of data extracted from the New Incentives program, facility records, and survey&#xD;
      data, the researchers will also investigate the sources of poor attitudes towards PMTCT&#xD;
      services, the influence of non-financial barriers on PMTCT retention, religious and cultural&#xD;
      norms surrounding delivery outside of clinic settings, and how the CCT intervention should be&#xD;
      structured to address the full cascade of PMTCT behaviors without compromising operational&#xD;
      feasibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main hypothesis to be tested:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conditional cash transfers (CCTs) provided by the All Babies Are Equal (ABAE) program carried&#xD;
      out by New Incentives, a non-governmental organization (NGO), will improve retention of&#xD;
      HIV-positive, pregnant women in prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) services&#xD;
      in Akwa Ibom, Nigeria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An ABAE program officer will be stationed at each study site on its respective antenatal&#xD;
      registration (i.e. &quot;Booking day&quot;) day from 8am to 6pm. On Booking Day, all women who test&#xD;
      positive for HIV will be recorded on a separate list by the HIV counselor or lab tester on&#xD;
      duty in the privacy of his/her office. For each 1-3 women listed, the names will be&#xD;
      transferred to the ABAE officer who will then transcribe the list in the order that they&#xD;
      appear into a spreadsheet with pre-generated random assignment of women to treatment (i.e.&#xD;
      offered to enroll ABAE program) and control (i.e. not offered the program) groups.&#xD;
      Individuals randomized to the treatment arm will then be approached by the ABAE officer to&#xD;
      screen and verify eligibility in person and against the subject's patient record card.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In-person visit to obtain informed consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Potential subjects that have been randomized to the treatment arm will be directed to a&#xD;
           room where the ABAE program officer will conduct the enrollment process. The ABAE&#xD;
           officer will then describe the program to the woman, discuss confidentiality and&#xD;
           privacy, and see if the woman is interested in participating. ABAE program officers will&#xD;
           follow a standardized enrollment script per the ABAE's standard operating procedures for&#xD;
           enrollment (see supplementary materials). The ABAE officers will explain both the ABAE&#xD;
           program and the accompanying research study, following informed consent procedures, and&#xD;
           obtain written consent for program and study participation. If the subject agrees to&#xD;
           participate in the program, the ABAE program officer will follow a standardized intake&#xD;
           protocol, including survey on background information, to enroll the woman into the&#xD;
           program. She will also be given an informational brochure describing the program,&#xD;
           including requirements to earn the cash rewards. This brochure is written in a simple&#xD;
           language and includes visual graphics to facilitate easy understanding.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women receive a small cash payment and mobile phone credits when she completes&#xD;
           enrollment to facilitate retrieval of cash from the bank and return phone call&#xD;
           verification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conditional Cash Transfer 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The participant enrolled in the ABAE program will call the New Incentives hotline the&#xD;
      morning after her ANC clinic visit to receive her payment code. If successful, she will&#xD;
      receive the first lump sum cash payment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conditional Cash Transfer 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A New Incentives staff member will check the data sources containing information about&#xD;
           medication pickups in the antenatal care ward in the morning of each participating&#xD;
           clinic's Booking Day to check which participants have met the conditions for the second&#xD;
           conditional cash transfer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During enrollment, participants are informed to call the New Incentives hotline the&#xD;
           Friday after retrieving their medications for the second time to receive the payment&#xD;
           code for the second lump sum payment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conditional Cash Transfer 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A New Incentives staff member will call the participant four to six weeks before her&#xD;
           expected due date to remind her of the third cash transfer. The participant will also be&#xD;
           reminded about facility delivery by an automated robot call and several text messages.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A New Incentives staff member will check the Labor Ward Registers in the morning of each&#xD;
           participating clinic's Booking Day to check if study participants have met the delivery&#xD;
           condition of the third conditional cash transfer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During enrollment, participants are informed to call the New Incentives hotline the&#xD;
           Friday after birth to receive the payment code for the third lump sum payment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conditional Cash Transfer 4:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A New Incentives staff member will call the participant four to five weeks after she&#xD;
           delivers to remind her of the fourth cash transfer. Furthermore, the participant&#xD;
           receives a text message regarding the early infant diagnosis test that needs to be taken&#xD;
           six weeks after delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A New Incentives staff member will check the relevant clinic register in the morning of&#xD;
           each participating clinic's Booking Day to check which participants have met the&#xD;
           conditions of the third transfer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During a hotline call, participants are informed to call the New Incentives hotline the&#xD;
           Friday after receiving the newborn's early infant diagnosis test to receive the payment&#xD;
           code for the fourth lump sum payment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of the conditional cash transfer program on the primary and secondary outcomes&#xD;
      will be assessed using a randomized control trial. A total of 550 pregnant women testing&#xD;
      positive for HIV will be screened for eligibility and randomized to the 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to obtaining consent, the HIV status of all individuals will be collected (this is&#xD;
      standard procedure at participating clinics for ANC enrollment). For women in the control&#xD;
      arm, additional administrative clinic data, including first name, last name, patient number,&#xD;
      pregnant mother number, date of birth, estimated delivery date, month of pregnancy, and phone&#xD;
      number will be collected prior to obtaining informed consent to facilitate record tracking&#xD;
      and later endline phone survey. Personal identifiers, however, will be deleted once data&#xD;
      collection is complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 3 main sources of data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient records will be extracted from hospital registers on a weekly basis. Extracted&#xD;
           records will reflect information collated from different facility registers, including&#xD;
           Patient Card, Laboratory Investigation Report Form, Adult Pharmacy Worksheet, ARV&#xD;
           Counselor's worksheet, Daily HIV Test worksheet, Nurses' notebooks, lab testers'&#xD;
           notebook, Delivery Register, Labor Ward Daily Report Book, Admissions Register, Child&#xD;
           Follow-up Register, Dried Blood Spot Specimen Transport Form, and the Pediatric Pharmacy&#xD;
           worksheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. ABAE program data for women in the treatment arm participating in the conditional cash&#xD;
           transfer program. These data include the information on program participants obtained&#xD;
           through the program enrollment survey, interim telephone calls and questionnaires, and&#xD;
           records of cash transfers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. An endline phone survey will be administered to all women enrolled in the study for&#xD;
           which a valid phone number has been obtained (8-10 weeks after delivery).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  At this point, the New Incentives employee will verify the subject's identification&#xD;
                (i.e. recently was pregnant and registered for antenatal services at the specific&#xD;
                participating clinic) and obtain verbal informed consent to participate in the&#xD;
                endline survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  This is the only contact that control subjects will have with the study personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  All individuals completing the phone survey will receive a small amount mobile&#xD;
                phone credits as compensation for their time.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The endline survey will ask participants about women's birth history,&#xD;
                decision-making over place of delivery, perceptions on program participation (if&#xD;
                enrolled in the ABAE program), a discrete choice experiment to elicit state&#xD;
                preferences over place of delivery (only for women randomized to the control arm),&#xD;
                and sociodemographic background.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Overall program effect:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Our basic analysis will be to calculate point estimates (e.g., achievement of each cash&#xD;
           transfer condition) with reasonable precision (i.e., the margin of error) for program&#xD;
           participants and non-participants overall and for key sub-categories (e.g., at each&#xD;
           facility) based on data abstracted from hospital records. We will first calculate&#xD;
           univariate statistics, such as mean retention for each PMTCT condition and standard&#xD;
           deviations, for program participants and non-participants, and means and standard&#xD;
           deviations for key sub-categories. We will then test whether retention percentages are&#xD;
           different between participants and non-participants with 2-tailed chi-squared tests of&#xD;
           proportions with significance at α=0.05. We can test for independent effects,&#xD;
           confounding, and interactions in multivariate analysis. Logistic regression analyses&#xD;
           will be used to test for autocorrelation between subjects enrolled at the same facility,&#xD;
           and hausman tests will be used to assess the relative fit of facility random and fixed&#xD;
           effects. Possible sources of confounding include differences in HIV testing procedures&#xD;
           and collection of patient records across facilities and over time (e.g. due to holidays,&#xD;
           agricultural seasons). For example, logistic regression predicting the likelihood of&#xD;
           delivering at the facility where ANC was sought can be used to simultaneously assess the&#xD;
           independent effect of program participation while controlling for facility site, stage&#xD;
           of pregnancy when enrolled, and time. Sensitivity analyses will be conducted to account&#xD;
           for known sources of attrition (e.g. participant requesting to be dis-enrolled) and/or&#xD;
           potential sources of spillover across study arms (e.g. women in the control group&#xD;
           reporting that they had heard about the ABAE program).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess the differences in program attrition and self-reported attitudes and behaviors&#xD;
           between control and treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
           With responses from the phone follow-up survey, which will be affected by unknown&#xD;
           sources of attrition, the study of self-reported behaviors and perceptions is not&#xD;
           designed to test one central hypothesis, but will involve exploratory statistical&#xD;
           testing of differences in self-reported behaviors and perceptions among program&#xD;
           participants vs. non-participants overall, and by key sub-categories (e.g.&#xD;
           sociodemographic characteristics, location of residence). Standard multiple linear&#xD;
           regression analysis will be used to assess individual determinants of outcomes and&#xD;
           changes in outcomes for continuous outcomes. Logistic regression analysis will be used&#xD;
           for dichotomous outcomes. For ordered categorical outcomes, count data, or potentially&#xD;
           censored outcomes, we will first assess whether a binomial, poisson, or negative&#xD;
           binomial distribution is appropriate by examining each outcome's dispersion. Depending&#xD;
           on the specification tests in #1 above, additional adjustments of autocorrelation will&#xD;
           be included. Wealth indices will be constructed using standardized methods following&#xD;
           Filmer and Pritchett (2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess the existence of heterogeneous treatment effects. Multivariate regression also&#xD;
           allows for testing interactions, such as whether program participation retention rates&#xD;
           are different for different groups of patients (e.g., by stage of pregnancy, facility, a&#xD;
           newly diagnosed HIV case, age).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Determine women's stated preferences for facility-based deliveries. We will complement&#xD;
           our primary analysis with a discrete choice experiment (DCE). The DCE is designed to&#xD;
           solicit respondents' preferences over several key childbirth or delivery&#xD;
           characteristics. Each DCE question asks respondents to state a preference for&#xD;
           hypothetical options A or B. First, for each question, we will use comparison of means&#xD;
           (and Chi-squared tests) and regression analysis (and t-tests) to compare the proportion&#xD;
           of respondents indicating A to the proportion indicating B. Second, using the same&#xD;
           statistical tools, we will pool questions with overlapping characteristics and measure&#xD;
           the change in stated choice associated with a particularly delivery characteristic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment projection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample sizes were calculated assuming a baseline delivery and drug pickup rate of 50%, which&#xD;
      produced the largest possible variance. A conservative estimate of the effect of the&#xD;
      intervention would be from a 50% baseline of delivery rates and drug collection to 70% after&#xD;
      the intervention. Such results would have 99.9% power if each group consists of 250 people.&#xD;
      Contrary to these conservative calculations assuming a 50% baseline, the baseline rate of&#xD;
      delivery is approximately 30% at clinic sites and drug pickup rates are even lower, according&#xD;
      to the clinic data. We therefore expect the study results to have 100% power. Power&#xD;
      calculations were carried out using the DS Research online power calculator. An additional&#xD;
      10% upward adjustment is made to account for possible refusals to participate.&#xD;
