    <textblock>
      The administration of fluids intravenously is the first step in the stabilization of patients&#xD;
      in septic shock. It is important to give the right dose of fluids, enough to improve the&#xD;
      function of the cardiovascular system but not too much to drown the cells in water. In order&#xD;
      to know that, the investigators use the &quot;fluid challenge&quot; which is the administration of a&#xD;
      &quot;small amount&quot; of fluid in a short period of time in order to test the cardiovascular&#xD;
      response to a dose of fluids. However, it is unclear how &quot;small&quot; this amount can be. The aim&#xD;
      of this study is to find out the minimum volume required to perform an effective &quot;fluid&#xD;
      challenge&quot;. The investigators hypothesize that the changes in the mean pressure in the&#xD;
      cardiovascular system (socalled mean systemic filling pressure or Pmsf) during the&#xD;
      administration of small amounts of fluid can be used to detect the minimum volume required to&#xD;
      effectively test the cardiovascular system with a fluid challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, microcirculation may remain impaired despite the stabilization of the&#xD;
      macrocirculation. The microcirculation can be much more dynamic than the macrocriculation, so&#xD;
      it is essential to observe the changes of both over time. Patients admitted at the&#xD;
      investigators' intensive care unit (ICU) due to sepsis can be included in this study. The&#xD;
      sample will be divided in 4 groups according to the volume of the fluid challenge: 2 ml/kg, 3&#xD;
      ml/kg, 4ml/Kg and 5 ml/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will measure the Pmsf non-invasively using a pneumatic tourniquet inflated&#xD;
      during one minute. Invasive arterial blood pressure will be observed during the inflation of&#xD;
      the cuff in the arm to determine the Pmsf. The least significant change of Pmsf using this&#xD;
      method is 14%. The minimal volume will be that one that achieve that change in Pmsf.&#xD;

      PURPOSE AND DESIGN The main objective of this study is to find out the minimum volume of&#xD;
      fluid required to perform an effective &quot;fluid challenge&quot; in septic patients. An effective&#xD;
      fluid challenge would be one that is able to increase the mean pressure in the cardiovascular&#xD;
      system when there is no blood circulation or socalled the mean systemic filling pressure&#xD;
      (Pmsf). It is similar to the pressure into a pneumatic tyre, which is only related to the&#xD;
      volume of air and the elastic properties of the tyre wall. In order to do this, the&#xD;
      investigators will observe the changes in mean systemic filling pressure after small amounts&#xD;
      of fluids so that the investigators will be able to realise how much volume is required to&#xD;
      increase that pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assure that the change in Pmsf is a real change, the investigators have conducted a pilot&#xD;
      study in order to determine the precision of the Pmsf measurement using the Pmsf-arm&#xD;
      technique. The least significant change is about 14 % from baseline measurement. The Pmsf-arm&#xD;
      technique is a process very similar to that the investigators use to measure non-invasive&#xD;
      blood pressure. The investigators will measure the arterial-venous equilibrium pressure in&#xD;
      the arm after a rapid and brief interruption of blood circulation. In order to do this, a&#xD;
      totally noninvasive automatic tourniquet is attached to the arm where the arterial line has&#xD;
      been inserted and the tourniquet is inflated during 60 seconds. This process will be done at&#xD;
      baseline and after the fluid challenge. The second objective is observe the microcirculation&#xD;
      during an affective fluid challenge and correlate the changes observed with the changes in&#xD;
      the cardiac function and the Pmsf.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third objective is to observe the changes generated by the vasoactive therapy in the&#xD;
      macro and microcirculation according to the cardiac response and the type of vasoactive&#xD;
      therapy used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the investigators' clinical practice, the investigators have observed that in some cases&#xD;
      the infusion of 250 ml of fluid has no impact at all in the cardiovascular function. The&#xD;
      investigators believe that in those cases the investigators may have not given enough fluid&#xD;
      to increase the Pmsf and test the cardiovascular response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RECRUITMENT The sample will be recruited by convenience. It is important to understand the&#xD;
      difference between fluid resuscitation and fluid challenge. The fluid resuscitation requires&#xD;
      normally large amount of volume in a medical emergency in order to achieve cardiovascular&#xD;
      stability. Once the patient is minimally stable, a fluid challenge is normally carried out in&#xD;
      order to find out if the patient may benefit from more fluids. As the performance of a fluid&#xD;
      challenge is part of the normal clinical practice once the patient has been admitted to ICU,&#xD;
      there is minimal extra risk from participation in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONSENT Informed consent will be required to become participant of this study. Informed&#xD;
      consent will be obtained by the Principal Investigator who has also clinical responsibility&#xD;
      for the care of patients under the care of the intensive care department. The PI has received&#xD;
      training in Good Clinical Practice (GCP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      RISK, BURDENS AND BENEFITS Currently, the investigators use a fluid administration protocol&#xD;
      in septic patients based on the principle of &quot;stroke volume maximization&quot;. The investigators&#xD;
      perform a fluid challenge of about 4 ml/kg until the patient becomes &quot;non-responder&quot;, which&#xD;
      means that the heart is not able to increase the volume ejected anymore. However, the&#xD;
      investigators have observed some pitfalls in this protocol. Some patients classified as&#xD;
      &quot;non-responders&quot; may need more than 4 ml/kg to test the cardiovascular response. The&#xD;
      investigators' hypothesis is that in those cases, the cardiovascular system is either very&#xD;
      relaxed or very empty, and 4 ml/kg was not enough to increase the mean systemic filling&#xD;
      pressure. Therefore, a possible benefit associated to this study is to avoid this possible&#xD;
      pitfall. If after a fluid challenge the Pmsf has not changed significantly, the clinician in&#xD;
      charge will be informed and he/she will decide whether continue with a subsequent fluid&#xD;
      challenge until the investigators observe a significant change on Pmsf.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are not relevant risk from participation in the study. As fluid challenge will be&#xD;
      performed in accordance with the clinician prescription, the observations are non-invasive&#xD;
      and do not involve any risk for the participant and arterial line is normally used in these&#xD;
      patients, there is minimal extra risk from participating in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONFIDENTIALITY Identifiable data will not be obtained for the purpose of this study. All the&#xD;
      data (case report forms and electronic files) will be anonymised. The participant will be&#xD;
      identified with a code that will be generated specifically for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;identification code&quot; generated for the participant will be linked to the &quot;hospital&#xD;
      number&quot; and to the name of the patient, by a secret rule that is kept confidentially by the&#xD;
      principal researcher. This rule will only be used in case of missing information that can be&#xD;
      completed retrospectively. The only person able to access to identifiable information is the&#xD;
      principal investigator, who is aware of the responsibility of the confidentiality of this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the data collected will be stored in encrypted electronic memories and the written&#xD;
      material in custody of the principal investigator. No written material will contain&#xD;
      identifiable data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONFLICT OF INTEREST During the period of study, the principal investigator will not be&#xD;
      responsible for the participant's care at the same time, in order to avoid conflict of&#xD;
      interest. However, the principal investigator retains clinical responsibility for the care of&#xD;
      patients as member of the intensive care department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study, the investigators are planning to use this information as a chapter&#xD;
      for a doctoral thesis, to present the study in international conferences and, hopefully, to&#xD;
      publish the results in scientific journals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient wishes to be informed of the results of this study, the investigators will&#xD;
      send a copy of the abstract presented in international conferences by email, or a copy of the&#xD;
      paper accepted in a medical journal by email.&#xD;
