  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, 2-part, open-label study to evaluate the metabolism and excretion&#xD;
      and absolute bioavailability of [14C]-AG-221 in healthy male subjects. It is planned for 14&#xD;
      subjects to be enrolled; each subject will participate in a screening phase, a baseline&#xD;
      phase, a treatment phase, and a follow up phone call. Blood, urine and fecal samples will be&#xD;
      collected in Part 1 for analyses. Blood samples will be collected in Part 2. Subjects can&#xD;
      only participate in either Part 1 or Part 2.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single-center, open-label, 2-part study in healthy adult males (n = 14). Parts&#xD;
      1 and 2 may be conducted in parallel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will participate in a screening phase, a baseline phase, a treatment phase, and&#xD;
      a follow up phone call. Subjects who have met all inclusion criteria and none of the&#xD;
      exclusion criteria at screening will return to the clinical site on Day 1 for baseline&#xD;
      assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: Absorption, metabolism, and excretion (AME) Approximately 8 subjects will be enrolled&#xD;
      in Part 1. Subjects will check into the clinic on the day before dosing. Following a 10 hour&#xD;
      overnight fast, subjects will receive a single 100-mg dose of AG-221 solution containing a&#xD;
      microtracer of [14C] AG 221 (~ 300 nCi) under fasted conditions. The study drug will be&#xD;
      administered as an oral solution with approximately 240 mL of room temperature,&#xD;
      non-carbonated water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood, urine, and fecal samples (and vomitus, if applicable) will be collected throughout the&#xD;
      study for pharmacokinetic (PK), mass balance, and/or clinical laboratory assessments. Safety&#xD;
      will be monitored throughout the study. Subjects will be discharged from the clinical site on&#xD;
      Day 22 following completion of the required study procedures. Subjects will return to the&#xD;
      unit on Day 29 for the last PK blood draw.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine and fecal samples will be collected each day until Day 22 (or the point of discharge if&#xD;
      earlier) for measurement of total [14C] radioactivity. Blood samples for radioanalysis and PK&#xD;
      assessment, inclusive of metabolite profiling/characterization, will be collected at pre-dose&#xD;
      and at specified intervals through Day 29. Total [14C]-radioactivity in whole blood, plasma,&#xD;
      urine, and feces (and vomitus, if applicable ) will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: Absolute bioavailability:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 6 subjects will be enrolled in Part 2. Qualified subjects who have met all&#xD;
      inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria at screening will return to the&#xD;
      clinical site on Day 1, and will be housed at the clinical site from Day 1 until Day 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, approximately 6 subjects will receive an oral&#xD;
      dose (coated tablet) of 100 mg of AG-221 at Hour 0 on dosing day (Day 1). The study drug will&#xD;
      be administered orally with approximately 240 mL of water. Four hours after the oral dose,&#xD;
      the subjects will receive 100 micrograms AG-221 containing ~300 nCi of&#xD;
      [14C]-AG-221administered as an intravenous bolus over approximately 2 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be discharged from the unit upon completion of the 48 hour PK blood draw on Day&#xD;
      3. Subjects will return to the unit for additional PK blood draws on Days 5, 8, 11, 15, 18,&#xD;
      22, and 29.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No urine and fecal samples will be collected in Part 2.&#xD;

             elective or medical procedures performed during the conduct of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Prior appendectomy is acceptable, but prior cholecystectomy would result in exclusion&#xD;

             antigen) or HCV Ab (Hepatitis C viral antibody), or have a positive result to the test&#xD;
             for HIV (Human immunodeficiency virus ) antibodies at screening.&#xD;
