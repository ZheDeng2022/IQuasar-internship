  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term goal is to acquire scientific knowledge that can be used to develop&#xD;
      mechanistic-driven intervention strategies aiming at restoring upper and lower-limb motor&#xD;
      function in individuals with cervical or thoracic spinal cord injury (SCI). The proposed&#xD;
      project will examine cortical, corticospinal, and spinal contribution to bilateral hand and&#xD;
      arm muscle activity during bilateral movements and spinal contributions to lower limb muscle&#xD;
      activity. By comparing changes in different sites within the Central Nervous System (CNS),&#xD;
      the investigators may also identify key mechanisms that might be differentially affected by&#xD;
      the injury, plasticity, and training.&#xD;

      If the participant qualifies to take part in this research study, they will be asked to&#xD;
      participate in 15-190 study visits,to complete the experimental procedures. These procedures&#xD;
      have been broken up into &quot;Phases&quot; and will be completed in any order. Phase I and Phase IIa&#xD;
      includes 2-30 total visits - approximately 2-3 hours each to measure arm and finger strength&#xD;
      and ability to move. Phase IIb includes 2-30 total visits - approximately 2-3 hours each, to&#xD;
      measure leg strength and ability to move. Phase IIIa includes up to 40 total visits -&#xD;
      approximately 2 hours each, the investigator will again evaluate the participant's ability to&#xD;
      use both arms. The participant will be asked to complete a series of tasks such as stacking&#xD;
      checkers, turning over cards, squeeze a device to determine how strong their grip is, and see&#xD;
      how well they are able to feel sensations on the surface of their skin. The investigators&#xD;
      will complete these assessments at pre-determined times during the study participation. Phase&#xD;
      IIIb includes up to 40 total visits - approximately 2 hours each, the investigator will again&#xD;
      evaluate the participant's ability to use both legs. Assessments of the participant's legs&#xD;
      will include walking around the lab space, how well they can bend their ankles and hips, and&#xD;
      how well they are able to feel sensations on the surface of the participant's skin.&#xD;
