      The composition of the intestinal bacterial flora effects gut immunologic function and&#xD;
      intestinal barrier integrity. HIV infection impairs gut immune and epithelial function&#xD;
      resulting in an altered gut bacterial flora and &quot;leakage&quot; of gut bacterial products into the&#xD;
      bloodstream. These bacterial products can overstimulate the immune system leading to&#xD;
      increased inflammation and HIV disease progression. The investigators will investigate&#xD;
      whether oral supplementation of certain beneficial &quot;probiotic&quot; bacteria may attenuate these&#xD;
      processes in HIV infected women in Mali, Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single arm study to evaluate the effect of 12 weeks of combination oral probiotic&#xD;
      supplementation (VSL#3, Sigma-Tau Pharmaceuticals - containing 9 × 1011 bacteria of 8&#xD;
      species: S. thermophilus, Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium&#xD;
      infantis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus paracasei, and&#xD;
      Lactobacillus bulgaricus) on plasma biomarkers of immune cell activation, and inflammation.&#xD;
      The study population will be 50 chronically HIV-infected but generally healthy, non-pregnant,&#xD;
      Malian women subjects with CD4+ T-cell count ≥ 350 cells/mm3 who are not receiving&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy. Blood plasma/serum and fecal sampling will occur at baseline, 4, and&#xD;
      12 week as well as at 24 weeks. At these time points, probiotic will be dispensed, a medical&#xD;
      history will be obtained, and adherence will be assessed. Prior to study entry, subjects will&#xD;
      have eligibility and safety labs will be obtained and detailed baseline medical and symptom&#xD;
      histories, demographics, weight, and stool frequency information will be recorded. A stress&#xD;
      assessment questionnaire will be completed at baseline and week 12 to determine the effect of&#xD;
      this intervention on stress levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study outcome is to assess change (baseline to 12 week) in plasma soluble CD14 (a&#xD;
      marker of monocyte response to bacterial endotoxin which has been associated with mortality)&#xD;
      with study probiotic. Other outcomes will include assessing change (baseline to 12 week) in&#xD;
      plasma interleukin-6, soluble CD163 (another monocyte activation marker), d-dimer (a marker&#xD;
      of coagulopathy), intestinal fatty acid binding protein (a marker of gut epithelial cell&#xD;
      injury) and fecal calprotectin (a marker of gut inflammation), as well as CD4+ T-cell counts,&#xD;
      self reported stool quality (using the Bristol Stool Scale), safety and tolerability of the&#xD;
      VSL#3 probiotic, and level of stress.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Excessive immune system stimulation, activation, and associated inflammation play a central&#xD;
      role in the pathogenesis of HIV disease. The level of T-cell and monocyte activation predicts&#xD;
      the rate of HIV disease progression to AIDS, the slope of CD4+ T-cell loss, and mortality&#xD;
      [Liu 1997, Liu 1998, Deeks 2004, Hunt 2008, Sandler 2011]. The mechanism by which HIV disease&#xD;
      causes persistent immune activation and inflammation is multifactorial, and includes the&#xD;
      direct pathogenic effect of replication, other chronic viral infections, as well as indirect&#xD;
      pathways. It is now generally accepted that bacterial translocation into the systemic&#xD;
      circulation due to HIV associated gut changes are an important part of this pathology. Both&#xD;
      HIV and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection result in rapid and profound depletion&#xD;
      of the gut mucosal Th17+CD4+ T-cells, key immune cells associated with reducing bacterial&#xD;
      translocation through the gut wall [Brenchley 2004, Raffetellu 2008]. In addition, both HIV&#xD;
      and SIV cause direct damage to intestinal epithelial cells [Li 2008, Nazli 2010], and gene&#xD;
      expression studies of the GI mucosa have revealed HIV-associated upregulation of genes&#xD;
      involved in inflammatory and apoptotic pathways and downregulation of tight junction&#xD;
      [Sankaran 2008]. These HIV-associated gut changes ultimately disrupt the normal synergistic&#xD;
      co-existence between man and his/her commensal gut microbial flora, resulting in increased&#xD;
      translocation of gut bacterial products such as endotoxin (also known as lipopolysaccharide)&#xD;
      and bacterial 16s ribosomal DNA into the systemic circulation. Here, these bacterial products&#xD;
      serve as potent stimuli for the sustained T-cell and monocyte activation and inflammation&#xD;
      that drive HIV disease progression [Hunt 2008, Brenchley 2006, Jiang 2009]. Treating HIV with&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) only partially corrects this gut lesion and related inflammatory&#xD;
      process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One possible approach to address this problem is to replenish &quot;ecological niches&quot; in the gut&#xD;
      with beneficial bacteria or &quot;probiotics&quot; such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacillus species,&#xD;
      which may be depleted in HIV infected persons and in certain other conditions. Probiotic&#xD;
      bacteria and their biofilms have been shown to stimulate innate immunity and result in&#xD;
      beneficial metabolic changes that improve gut epithelial barrier and Th17 T-cell functions&#xD;
      and reduces gut inflammation and endotoxin leak [Bassaganya-Rievra 2012, Pagnini 2009,&#xD;
      Giamarellos-Bourboulis 2009]. This has proven beneficial in several clinical settings&#xD;
      including ulcerative colitis, illeal pouch inflammation, and acute diarrhea in children&#xD;
      [Tursi 2010, Miele 2009, Minmura 2004, Salari 2012]. In HIV infected individuals, patients&#xD;
      treated with ART who fail to attain the expected improvement in blood CD4+ T-cell counts seem&#xD;
      to lack the measureable plasma 16s ribosomal DNA signature of Lactobacillus species or have&#xD;
      lower fecal concentrations of lactobacillus [Merlini 2011, Perez-Santiago 2013]. Primate SIV&#xD;
      models using pigtail macaques have demonstrated that Lactobacillus plantarum supplementation&#xD;
      enhances gut Th17 CD4 recruitment, interleukin (IL)-17 expression, epithelial tight junction&#xD;
      protein production, and decreases inflammatory chemokines and IL-1B [Sankaran 2013]. Another&#xD;
      recent study demonstrated that SIV infected macaques had significantly improved numbers of&#xD;
      gut antigen presenting cells and mucosal CD4+ T-cells, reduced gut lymphoid tissue fibrosis,&#xD;
      and reduced plasma d-dimer levels when given ART and a combination of probiotic bacteria&#xD;
      (VSL#3 and L. rhamnosus CG) vs ART alone [Klatt 2013]. Thus, probiotics could offer important&#xD;
      benefits to HIV-infected patients by improving intestinal mucosal and immunologic function&#xD;
      and reducing the subsequent bacterial translocation and immune activation that leads to AIDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A limited number of studies have looked at probiotics to reduce diarrhea or improve CD4+&#xD;
      T-cell counts in HIV infected individuals, particularly in Africa. Individuals in sub-Sahara&#xD;
      Africa are more likely to have diarrhea than in developed countries and the gut microbiome is&#xD;
      different [Yatsunenko 2012], as is the greater burden of intestinal parasitosis and&#xD;
      pathogenic bacteria such as Salmonella and Cholera. Some data suggest that non-HIV-infected&#xD;
      individuals (of African descent as compared to Caucasians, and women as compared with men)&#xD;
      may have greater intestinal permeability or display more pronounced systemic inflammatory&#xD;
      responses. A study of 24 HIV-infected Nigerian women (CD4+ T-cell count &gt;200, not on ART)&#xD;
      with diarrhea were randomized to receive 15 days of yogurt with or without a probiotic&#xD;
      (Lactobacillus rhamnosus CG and L. reuteri). The probiotic group had a resolution of diarrhea&#xD;
      and stable or improved CD4+ T-cell counts at one month compared to unsupplemented yogurt&#xD;
      [Anukam 2008]. Similar CD4 improvements were observed in a randomized probiotic&#xD;
      (Bifidobacterium bifidum and Streptococcus thermophilus) study in HIV infected African&#xD;
      children [Trois 2008]. An observational study examining the introduction of probiotic yogurt,&#xD;
      made by local HIV infected women in a low-income community in Tanzania, was associated with&#xD;
      significantly increased CD4+ T-cell counts [Irvine 2010]. Probiotics have proven safe and&#xD;
      well tolerated in these and other [Irvine 2011, Kerac 2009, Hummelen 2011, Wolf 1998] studies&#xD;
      of HIV infected individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for Probiotic Bacteria Selection and Safety - All Lactobacillus sp. and other&#xD;
      probiotic bacteria may not perform equally well to restore gut mucosal integrity and immune&#xD;
      function and do so in a safe fashion. VSL#3® DS (Double-Strength, Sigma-Tau Pharmaceuticals)&#xD;
      is a well characterized water soluble, live (9 × 1011 bacteria/sachet, once daily),&#xD;
      lyophilized preparation of 8 probiotic bacterium, lacking L. rhamnosus but including&#xD;
      previously discussed L. plantarum and S. thermophilus (along with Bifidobacterium breve,&#xD;
      Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium infantis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus&#xD;
      paracasei, and Lactobacillus bulgaricus) that has been studied extensively, with over 140&#xD;
      PubMed citations since 1999. VSL#3 has been shown in vitro and in vivo (rat model) to&#xD;
      increase tight junction proteins, reduce intestinal permeability, reduce inflammation,&#xD;
      enhance innate immunity, and reduce salmonella invasion [Dai 2012, Mencarelli 2012, Appleyard&#xD;
      2011, Madsen 2001, Pagnini 2010, Gad 2011]. L. paracasei contained within VSL#3 encodes&#xD;
      &quot;lactocepin&quot; a protease that selectively degrades secreted and cell-associated chemokines and&#xD;
      reduced inflammation in a murine colitis model [von Schillde 2102]. As previously noted, SIV&#xD;
      infected macaques had improved numbers of gut antigen presenting cells and mucosal CD4+&#xD;
      T-cells when given VSL#3 and L. rhamnosus vs ART alone [Klatt 2013].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinically, VSL#3 has been studied extensively for &quot;pouchitis&quot;, which may occur following&#xD;
      ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for chronic ulcerative colitis in approximately 30% of patients.&#xD;
      Several randomized clinical trial and a Cochrane database review support the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of VSL#3 in reducing acute and chronic pouch inflammation [Holubar 2010]. VSL#3® DS&#xD;
      is the only probiotic recognized as an effective tool for the management of pouchitis by the&#xD;
      American College of Gastroenterology as well as the German Association of Gastroenterology.&#xD;
      Similarly, VSL#3 was an effective adjunct in relapsing mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis in&#xD;
      a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study [Tursi 2010]. In a randomized trial of&#xD;
      59 children with irritable bowel syndrome, VSL#3 was superior to placebo in reducing&#xD;
      abdominal pain/discomfort and bloating [Guandalini 2010]. A double-blind, randomized clinical&#xD;
      trial of 229 at risk hospitalized patients demonstrated that VSL#3 could prevent&#xD;
      antibiotic-associated diarrhea [Selinger 2013]. VSL#3 has been studied in healthy, pregnant&#xD;
      Italian women, cirrhotic patients, and critically ill patients with no safety issues [Vitali&#xD;
      2012, Agrwal 2012, Gupta N 2013, Frohmader 2010].&#xD;
&#xD;
      As previously noted, the medical literature identifies only rare cases of lactobacillus or&#xD;
      bifidobacillus bacteremia (not associated with VSL#3), generally in severely immune&#xD;
      compromised patients or nosocomial, central line associated infections on persons not taking&#xD;
      probiotic. An 8 year retrospective study in a large U.S. academic medical center found a&#xD;
      maximum 0.2% probiotic bacteremia incidence among hospitalized probiotic recipients [Simkins&#xD;
      2013]. An extensive review by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)&#xD;
      completed in 2011 of 387 case series and randomized controlled trials involving over 24,000&#xD;
      patients found no cases where use of a product including Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium,&#xD;
      Saccharomyces, Streptococcus, Enterococcus, or Bacillus led to a hospital admission [Hempel&#xD;
      2011]. Evidence for hospital admissions or bacteremias due to probiotics use came only from&#xD;
      case reports and were rare. The DHHS study found no evidence of increased adverse effects&#xD;
      associated with probiotic use but added that &quot;rare adverse events are difficult to assess,&#xD;
      and despite the substantial number of publications, the current literature is not well&#xD;
      equipped to answer questions on the safety of probiotic interventions with confidence&quot;. An&#xD;
      independent panel of food safety experts concluded that VSL#3® is &quot;Generally Recognized As&#xD;
      Safe (GRAS) for medical food use.&quot; GRAS is an U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)&#xD;
      designation that acknowledges certain food additives as safe under the conditions of their&#xD;
      intended use by qualified experts. To receive such recognition, the product must establish a&#xD;
      consensus of expert opinion regarding the safety of its use based on a review of scientific&#xD;
      evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for a Single Arm Design - The hypothesis being tested is that oral probiotic&#xD;
      bacteria supplementation will reduce endotoxemia and endotoxin-associated macrophage and&#xD;
      T-cell activation in HIV-infected subjects. Because we expect endotoxin and macrophage/T-cell&#xD;
      activation levels to remain stable (or perhaps slowly increase) in subjects who are not&#xD;
      receiving ART [Deeks 2004], a single arm study will allow us to determine whether the&#xD;
      intervention has an effect. In this study, individuals with CD4+ T-cell counts &gt;350 cells/mm3&#xD;
      will be enrolled. Among persons with CD4+ T-cell counts &gt;350 cells/mm3, the rate of AIDS and&#xD;
      non-AIDS events was 0.7 events per 100 person-years [Baker 2008], so investigators expect&#xD;
      these complications to be unlikely during the study. Recently, WHO guidelines have changed to&#xD;
      recommend starting ART when the HIV infected individual's CD4+ T-cell counts is &lt;500&#xD;
      cells/mm3 so it is likely that some subjects would now be recommended for ART. However, ART&#xD;
      availability is currently limited in this region so many potential subjects could participate&#xD;
      until such time as ART is more broadly available. Subjects with plans to initiate ART within&#xD;
      the study duration of 24 weeks will not be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN - This is a single arm study to evaluate the effect of 12 weeks of combination&#xD;
      oral probiotic supplementation (VSL#3) on biomarkers of microbial translocation, monocyte and&#xD;
      T-cell activation, and inflammation in the blood in chronically HIV-infected Malian women&#xD;
      subjects with CD4+ T-cell count ≥ 350 cells/mm3 who are not receiving ART. Subjects will be&#xD;
      re-evaluated at week 24 to determine sustainability of any changes. This study will enroll 50&#xD;
      subjects. Blood plasma/serum and fecal sampling will occur at baseline, 4, 12, and 24 weeks.&#xD;
      All subjects will be examined for intestinal parasites within 45 days before study entry.&#xD;
      Detailed demographic, weight and BMI, stool frequency, symptoms, ART history, CD4 and HIV RNA&#xD;
      will be recorded. A stress assessment questionnaire will be completed at baseline and week 12&#xD;
