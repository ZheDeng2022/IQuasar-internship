  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to evaluate the safety, feasibility, and effectiveness of fetal&#xD;
      cystoscopy as an experimental procedure in avoiding perinatal death and renal impairment and&#xD;
      to compare to the investigators clinical experience with fetal vesicoamniotic shunting.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with severe LUTO will come for clinical evaluation as part of the standard clinical&#xD;
      care at the Fetal Center at Texas Children's Hospital. Once the diagnosis of fetal severe&#xD;
      LUTO is confirmed and the patient is considered for fetal intervention, patient will be&#xD;
      invited to participate in the present study. Fetal cystoscopy will be offered as an optional&#xD;
      experimental procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following information will be obtained in the standard clinical care visit as usual: a.&#xD;
      demographics (maternal age, parity); b. gestational age at the diagnosis of LUTO; c. fetal&#xD;
      ultrasound findings including documentation of cervical length, gestational age,fetal bladder&#xD;
      size, bladder wall thickness, degree of fetal hydronephrosis, amount of amniotic fluid, fetal&#xD;
      biometry; d. fetal urinary biochemistry; e. fetal echocardiogram findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard management options for fetal LUTO include expectant management, fetal&#xD;
      vesico-amniotic shunting or termination of pregnancy according to the law. These options will&#xD;
      be offered to all patients as the first set of management options and the gold standard. In&#xD;
      addition, the investigators group will offer the procedure as an alternative experimental&#xD;
      option, with a full explanation of the experimental nature of the procedure, the technical&#xD;
      benefits and difficulties, and the risks and potential benefits of the procedure and the&#xD;
      limited long-term outcomes information. Those patients who request participation in the&#xD;
      present study will be informed that they can, a priori, select a crossover arm if for any&#xD;
      reason the fetal cystoscopic procedure is not possible. They can elect that a fetal&#xD;
      vesico-amniotic shunting be performed or prenatal expectant management or even termination of&#xD;
      pregnancy (as part of the standard management of fetuses with LUTO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the patient is deemed eligible, all prenatal standard management options will be offered&#xD;
      first to the patient. Fetal cystoscopy will be offered as an investigational procedure for&#xD;
      evaluation. If the patient opts for the fetal cystoscopy, we will explain that this procedure&#xD;
      can be diagnostic and therapeutic. In order to prevent coercion, the investigation procedure&#xD;
      will be presented to the patient in a manner that is an option and voluntary, if the patient&#xD;
      chooses not to participate in the investigational procedure, the clinical care will not be&#xD;
      affected. Informed consent to participate in the present study will be obtained. We will also&#xD;
      include non-English speaking subjects in the present study. We will submit a full Spanish&#xD;
      consent via amendment for IRB approval after approval of the English consent. We will not&#xD;
      enroll any non-English subjects until we receive final approval. The study flow is&#xD;
      demonstrated in Figure 1 (see attached document).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the fetal cystoscopy procedure (experimental procedure):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fetal cystoscopy will be performed between 16 0/7 and 25 6/7 weeks at the Pavilion for Women&#xD;
      - TCH. This procedure will be performed under maternal local anesthesia and sedation. In some&#xD;
      cases, according to the anesthesiologist's indication, maternal epidural may be performed.&#xD;
      Fetal anesthesia will be performed by ultrasound-guided injection into fetal arm or leg of a&#xD;
      combination of fentanyl (15µglKg), atropine and vecuronium (0.5-2mg/Kg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prophylactic tocolysis will be used in all patients with a protocol employing magnesium&#xD;
      sulfate - 6 gram IV loading dose followed by a 2 gram/hour continuous infusion for 24 hours,&#xD;
      followed by nifedipine 10mg Q6 during until 36 weeks of gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prophylactic antibiotics will also be used during the procedure using Cefazolin 2 g IV&#xD;
      immediately before the procedure. Nafcillin will be injected into the amniotic cavity at the&#xD;
      conclusion of the procedure. In case the patient has allergies to cephalosporin, clindamycin&#xD;
      600 mg will be used as alternative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Steroids for fetal lung maturation will be given between 24 and 25 6/7 weeks (two doses of 12&#xD;
      mg betamethasone given 24 hours apart, with the last dose given 48-72 hours before the&#xD;
      procedure), if the procedure is performed during this gestational period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure will be performed percutaneously under ultrasound-fetoscopic guidance. An 18G&#xD;
      needle will be introduced into the fetal bladder through the maternal abdominal wall and&#xD;
      uterus under ultrasound guidance. Using a Seldinger technique an 8-9Fr Cook trocar will be&#xD;
      inserted through the maternal wall towards the fetal bladder. A curved Storz sheath for 1.3&#xD;
      mm (11530AA, Karl Storz, Tuttlinglen, Germany) or 2.0 mm fetoscopy (26120BA, Karl Storz,&#xD;
      Tuttlingen, Germany) or flexible ureteroscope will be introduced into the Cook catheter into&#xD;
      the fetal bladder. After confirming that the trochar is inside the fetal bladder, urine&#xD;
      samples will be collected for further renal function analysis. The fetoscope will be advanced&#xD;
      toward the bladder neck and the dilated posterior urethra. If a membrane-like obstruction of&#xD;
      the urethral lumen is seen, the diagnosis of PUV will be confirmed and at this time the&#xD;
      valves will be fulgurated using a Diode laser with low energy (15-20W). If necessary, we will&#xD;
      use a guide-wire to perforate the valves. Fulguration of the valves will be performed very&#xD;
      cautiously with the laser fiber almost touching them in order to avoid damaging peripheral&#xD;
      tissues. When the valves are completely disrupted, the urine will be released through the now&#xD;
      patent urethra, which results in emptying the bladder. A transurethral shunt may be placed&#xD;
      depending on the cause of the obstruction (urethral stenosis). In addition, power Doppler&#xD;
      will be applied to confirm passage of fluid through the patent urethra into the amniotic&#xD;
      cavity. However, if a non membrane-like structure is found, even with the fluid injection or&#xD;
      the guide-wire, urethral atresia (UA, US or Prune Belly syndrome) will be diagnosed and we&#xD;
      will not attempt to perforate this structure. A vesicoamniotic shunting placement will be&#xD;
      performed in this situation depending on the patient's consent prior to the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The postsurgical care is going to follow the same standard prenatal care after fetal&#xD;
      vesico-amniotic shunting. The expected hospital course is 72 hours as it is also expected for&#xD;
      fetal vesico-amniotic shunting; however, it is possible that the patient will be hospitalized&#xD;
      for complications or preterm labor. The patient will then be discharged home with&#xD;
      recommendations for modified bed rest for the first 2 weeks post discharge, but will&#xD;
      subsequently be allowed to graduate to moderate activity if the uterus is quiescent. Patients&#xD;
      will return on a weekly basis for clinical and ultrasound evaluation. On ultrasound, fetal&#xD;
      kidneys, bladder thickness and dilatation, and amniotic fluid volume will be assessed. Fetal&#xD;
      Surveillance by biophysical profiles and Doppler studies will begin at 34 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delivery mode will be performed based on the obstetrical management following the&#xD;
      investigators clinical algorithm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects that undergo fetal cystoscopy will have exactly the same postnatal routine&#xD;
      (standard of care) clinical follow-up that is provided to all infants with LUTO. All infants&#xD;
      with LUTO are followed-up by the pediatric urology and nephrology services and may need&#xD;
      postnatal surgical intervention. At birth, the clinical evaluation will include a renal&#xD;
      ultrasound, voiding cysto-urethrogram (VCUG) as well as clinical laboratory examinations such&#xD;
      as serum creatinine, sodium, calcium, potassium and chloride, and a urine analysis will be&#xD;
      performed as part of the standard clinical care. Information from these routine examinations&#xD;
      will be collected and documented.&#xD;
