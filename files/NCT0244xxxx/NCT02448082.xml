  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dandruff, also known as Pityriasis capitis, is a common condition which affects the scalp of&#xD;
      almost half the post-pubertal population regardless of race and gender. It is said that&#xD;
      dandruff affects at least 50% of the world's adult population and about 15 - 20% of the&#xD;
      world's total population. Dandruff is usually marked by flaking as well as itching and&#xD;
      irritation of the scalp which can also lead to greasiness. Dandruff can lead to physiological&#xD;
      and psychological issues and can be very distressing and embarrassing for the sufferer,&#xD;
      causing low self esteem and social problems. Current treatment options for dandruff include&#xD;
      many over-the-counter preparations, anti-dandruff shampoos and topical steroid applications&#xD;
      which are accompanied by numerous adverse effects. According to Lunar Pharmaceuticals&#xD;
      Ichthyol® Pale is a sodium salt of pale sulphonated shale oil in aqueous solution with&#xD;
      anti-microbial properties which can combat dandruff helping with the causative and&#xD;
      symptomatic relief of this condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to determine the efficacy of Sodium Shale Oil Sulponate 1% shampoo in&#xD;
      the treatment of Pityriasis capitis. This will be evaluated using the Adherent Scalp Flaking&#xD;
      Score (ASFS) grading and the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).&#xD;

      The research study will be performed as a 16 day double-blind placebo controlled study&#xD;
      design. The research will be conducted at the University of Johannesburg, Doornfontein&#xD;
      Campus. Forty participants, both males and females, between the ages of 18 and 45 years will&#xD;
      be recruited via advertisements placed at the University of Johannesburg Health Clinic,&#xD;
      Doornfontein Campus, at hair salons and gyms situated around Gauteng (with relevant&#xD;
      permission given).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial consult (day zero) will consist of a full description and discussion of the&#xD;
      research method with the participant. Thereafter, the participant will be requested to read a&#xD;
      participant information form and sign a consent form. An evaluation, based on the inclusion&#xD;
      and exclusion criteria, to determine whether the participant meets the criteria for the&#xD;
      research study will be performed. A physical and general assessment will be conducted to&#xD;
      determine vital signs and health status respectively. Thereafter, the participant's dandruff&#xD;
      will be evaluated using the Adherent Scalp Flaking Score (ASFS) grading, completed by the&#xD;
      researcher, and the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), completed by both the participant and the&#xD;
      researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be divided into two groups by means of match pairing, according to&#xD;
      severity of dandruff. Based on the determined group, the participants will be given either&#xD;
      the experimental (with active anti-dandruff agents) or control (without active anti-dandruff&#xD;
      agents) shampoo together with the directions for the use of the shampoo at the first&#xD;
      consultation. At the second consultation, which will occur on day 8, the participant's scalp&#xD;
      will be evaluated using the ASFS grading, completed by the researcher, and the VAS, completed&#xD;
      by both the participant and the researcher. On day 16 (final consult), a final evaluation of&#xD;
      the participant's dandruff will be done, using the same method described as with the second&#xD;
      consultation. At each consult, all results will be recorded. Participants will be requested&#xD;
      to wash the scalp once every second day, starting from day 1 to day 16. Reminders to wash the&#xD;
      scalp will be sent to each participant via a text message the night before they are due to&#xD;
      wash their hair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On completion of the study, all data will be collated and an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)&#xD;
      will be performed to determine group normality and comparability of the data. Parametric&#xD;
      intergroup analysis will include the independent T-sample test, followed by intragroup&#xD;
      analysis using the ANOVA measurement. Non-parametric intergroup analysis will include the&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney U test, while intragroup analysis will involve the Friedman or the Wilcoxon&#xD;
      Signed-Ranks test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positive results of the study may yield an effective and safe treatment option for dandruff.&#xD;
