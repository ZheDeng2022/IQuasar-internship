  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that washing the insemination catheter prior to performing the&#xD;
      IUI (intrauterine insemination) will improve the pregnancy outcome in IUI cycles when&#xD;
      compared to controls (without pre-washing the catheter).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Catheter washing is performed routinely before embryo transfer, however it is not done for&#xD;
      IUI catheters. Therefore no data is available on applying the technique to IUI catheters&#xD;
      prior to insemination.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if pre-washing the catheter before insemination improves the pregnancy outcome&#xD;
      in women undergoing IUI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the impact of pre-washing the catheter before insemination on the ectopic&#xD;
           pregnancy rate in women undergoing IUI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the impact of pre-washing the catheter before insemination on the&#xD;
           miscarriage rate in women undergoing IUI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the impact of pre-washing the catheter before insemination on the multiple&#xD;
           pregnancy rates in women undergoing IUI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a prospective double blind trial among women undergoing IUI at the MUHC&#xD;
      reproductive centre using a cluster randomized design. The week will be defined as the unit&#xD;
      for the clusters of randomization. Weeks will be allocated to one of the following groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1 = pre-washing group (patients will have the IUI with a pre-washed catheter&#xD;
           during that week)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2 = control group (no pre-washing before IUI during that week)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A random block size will be used to minimize the risk of non-blinding. The study is&#xD;
      double-blind, neither the patients nor the physicians performing IUI will know whether the&#xD;
      catheter was washed or not, as both the sample and the catheter will be prepared by the&#xD;
      andrology lab technician. The cluster randomization design is justified since the management&#xD;
      of the unit will not allow us to perform a randomization at the patient level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However a very low Intra-Correlation Coefficient (ICC) between patients is expected.&#xD;

    After reviewing the interim analysis results the study was terminated as a bigger sample size&#xD;
    was needed to find a significant difference between the groups.&#xD;

    <description>Intervention: pre-washing of the IUI catheter&#xD;
Throughout the research period all of the insemination catheters used for patients recruited in our study, will be prepared as follows:&#xD;
Connection: The catheter used for insemination, will be connected to the sperm filled syringe as per our standard procedure.&#xD;
Catheter washing: The sperm washing media will be aspirated and then flushed through the insemination catheter..&#xD;
Sperm loading: catheters washed or not connected to the syringe will be loaded with the washed sperm sample as our standard procedure.&#xD;
Labeling:&#xD;
Patient identification data will be labeled on the syringe and place back in the original package cover to ensure proper blinding and sterility of the catheter.</description>
