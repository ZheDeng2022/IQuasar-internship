ETBB benefits score was calculated using the responses from questions 1, 4, 7, 8, 10, and 12 and ETBB barriers score was calculated using the responses from questions 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, and 11. Both was calculated as the sum of responses divided by number of responses received multiplied by the maximum number of responses. Based on the responses used the maximum responses available was 6.

      <recruitment_details>The trial was conducted at 94 sites in Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Russian Federation, Spain, Sweden, Ukraine, the United Kingdom (UK), and the United States (US).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants were randomised in a 1:1:1:1 manner to one of the four treatment groups. One participant was randomised to liraglutide arm but was withdrawn from the trial before exposure to trial products as per investigator's decision.</pre_assignment_details>

Participants took liraglutide placebo once daily, subcutaneously, with the volume of placebo equivalent to the volume liraglutide 0.6 mg, 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg. Participants received treatment for 54 weeks followed by an off-treatment observation period of 26 weeks. Participants continued their pre-trial insulin treatment throughout the trial.</description>

Participants took liraglutide placebo once daily, subcutaneously, with the volume of placebo equivalent to the volume liraglutide 0.6 mg, 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg. Participants received treatment for 54 weeks followed by an off-treatment observation period of 26 weeks. Participants continued their pre-trial insulin treatment throughout the trial.</description>

Participants took liraglutide placebo once daily, subcutaneously, with the volume of placebo equivalent to the volume liraglutide 0.6 mg, 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg. Participants received treatment for 54 weeks followed by an off-treatment observation period of 26 weeks. Participants continued their pre-trial insulin treatment throughout the trial.</description>

Participants took 0.6 mg of liraglutide, once daily, subcutaneously, for first two weeks, 1.2 mg for next 2 weeks and 1.8 mg for rest of the treatment period. Participants received treatment for 54 weeks followed by an off-treatment observation period of 26 weeks. Participants continued their pre-trial insulin treatment throughout the trial.</description>

        <title>Change in Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36)</title>
        <description>SF-36v2™ questionnaire measured the HRQoL on 8 domains (Bodily Pain, General Health, Mental Health, Physical Functioning, Role Emotion, Physical Health, Social Functioning and Vitality) on individual scale ranges. The scores 0-100 (where higher scores indicated a better HRQoL) from the SF-36 were converted to norm-based scores to enable a direct interpretation in relation to the distribution of the scores in the 2009 U.S. general population. Change from baseline (week 0) to week 54 and week 80 in SF-36 score is presented.The MCS measure is derived from domain scales of vitality, social functioning, role emotional and mental health. The PCS measure is derived from domain scales of physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, and general health. A norm-based score of 50 corresponds to the mean score and 10 corresponds to the standard deviation of the 2009 U.S. general population. A positive change score indicate an improvement since baseline.</description>

        <title>Change in Experience of Treatment Benefits and Barriers (ETBB)</title>
        <description>Treatment Benefits and Barriers (ETBB) questionnaire measured diabetes-specific health beliefs on 2 categories: Total Score for Perceived Barriers and Perceived Benefits. The measurement of perceived benefits of, and barriers to, treatment was achieved by creating a pool 28 statements each with a 7-point scale ranging from strongly agree (6) to strongly disagree (0). ETBB benefits score was calculated using the responses from questions 1, 4, 7, 8, 10, and 12 and ETBB barriers score was calculated using the responses from questions 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, and 11. Both was calculated as the sum of responses divided by number of responses received multiplied by the maximum number of responses. Based on the responses used the maximum responses available was 6. The higher score indicates more perceived benefits or more perceived barrier.</description>
