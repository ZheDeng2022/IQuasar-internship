    <textblock>
      Hypoglycemia can produce a spectrum of pro-inflammatory and pro-atherothrombotic changes. To&#xD;
      date no studies appear to have investigated the effects of differing levels of hypoglycemia&#xD;
      on the vasculature and pro-atherothrombotic balance during hypoglycemia in healthy man. The&#xD;
      specific aim of our study will be to determine the effects of differing levels of&#xD;
      hypoglycemia on in-vivo vascular biologic mechanisms in a healthy population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent large randomized multicenter trials have investigated the effects of lowering blood&#xD;
      glucose levels towards normal in both inpatient and ambulatory care/community settings. All&#xD;
      studies have reported increasing prevalence and incidence of hypoglycemia as glucose levels&#xD;
      approach normal. In fact, the occurrence of hypoglycemia was so problematic that some&#xD;
      hospital based studies were halted and the target recommendations for glucose levels in&#xD;
      critically unwell patients have been increased. Similarly three recent large glucose control&#xD;
      and complications trials in type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) have reported significantly high&#xD;
      rates of hypoglycemia in intensively treated type 2 DM individuals. In two of these studies&#xD;
      (VADT, ADVANCE) there was a highly significant association between severe hypoglycemia&#xD;
      (glucose low enough to cause neurologic impairment) and serious cardiac events and increased&#xD;
      death. Furthermore, in two studies performed in the USA (VADT, ACCORD), severe hypoglycemia&#xD;
      occurring in the standard/conventionally treated group produced even more serious adverse&#xD;
      cardiac effects as compared to the intensively treated group. The in-vivo mechanism(s)&#xD;
      responsible for the above findings could not be identified from the above studies.&#xD;
      Surprisingly there is very limited data available regarding the effects of hypoglycemia on&#xD;
      in-vivo vascular biology. Previously, in vitro work has determined that epinephrine,&#xD;
      norepinephrine, growth hormone, glucagon, and corticosteroids (all counterregulatory&#xD;
      hormones) can have vascular biologic effects (platelet aggregation, fibrinolytic balance,&#xD;
      increases in pro-inflammatory markers and changes in endothelial function). Three recent&#xD;
      studies from my own and other laboratories performed in healthy volunteers and type 1 DM have&#xD;
      demonstrated that hypoglycemia can produce a spectrum of pro-inflammatory and&#xD;
      pro-atherothrombotic changes. Novel preliminary data from my lab has also demonstrated that&#xD;
      hypoglycemia can impair endothelial function, reduce fibrinolytic balance (increase&#xD;
      plasminogen activator inhibitor-1) and produce pro-atherothrombotic (increase platelet&#xD;
      aggregation, thrombin anti-thrombin complexes, vascular adhesion molecules) changes in type 2&#xD;
      DM. Additionally, preliminary data presented below will demonstrate that a 90 minute episode&#xD;
      of hypoglycemia (50 mg/dl) produces similar pro-atherothrombotic changes as compared to 4&#xD;
      hours of hyperglycemia (200 mg/dl). However, as investigators are just beginning to realize&#xD;
      the effects of hypoglycemia on vascular biology, there remain many unanswered questions. For&#xD;
      example, in the vulnerable type 2 DM population what is the dose response of different levels&#xD;
      of hypoglycemia with attendant ANS activation on endothelial function and atherothrombotic&#xD;
      balance? How does level of glycemic control affect ANS and vascular biologic responses to&#xD;
      hypoglycemia in type 2 DM? Proposed studies in this protocol will provide novel information&#xD;
      answering the clinically important question regarding the effects of mild to moderate&#xD;
      hypoglycemia on vascular biologic mechanisms in a healthy population.&#xD;
