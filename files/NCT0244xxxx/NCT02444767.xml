  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Bimatoprost Ocular Insert is intended to provide sustained delivery of bimatoprost to the&#xD;
      ocular surface to lower the intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with open-angle glaucoma&#xD;
      or ocular hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetic aspects of the Bimatoprost Ocular Insert in&#xD;
      healthy (non-glaucoma) subjects.&#xD;

      This study is designed to provide pharmacokinetic (PK) data with respect to the relative&#xD;
      systemic exposure to bimatoprost and bimatoprost acid after administration of a single 13 mg&#xD;
      Bimatoprost Ocular Insert for 1 week in medically stable adult subjects with or without&#xD;
      primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) or ocular hypertension (OHT).&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. A history of clinically significant gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, neurologic,&#xD;
             hematologic, endocrine, oncologic, pulmonary, immunologic, psychiatric, or&#xD;
             cardiovascular disease or any other condition which, in the opinion of the Principal&#xD;
             Investigator, would jeopardize the safety of the subject or impact the validity of the&#xD;
             study results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. A history of allergic or adverse responses to bimatoprost or any comparable or similar&#xD;
             product.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects who are unable to tolerate the Inserts that do not contain drug for the 7&#xD;
             days trial wear period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects who require two (2) or more site-assisted replacements of the inserts that do&#xD;
             not contain drug during the 7 days trial wear period.&#xD;

             infection, corneal edema). Patients may have mild blepharitis, mild dry eye,&#xD;
             cataracts, age-related macular degeneration or background diabetic retinopathy if, in&#xD;
             the opinion of the Investigator, it would not interfere with the conduct of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Smoking or use of tobacco products or products containing nicotine within 6 months&#xD;
