      The purpose of this study is to evaluate clinically, histologically and radiographically the&#xD;
      healing of extraction sockets with Zimmer's Puros® allograft compared to creos™ (creo™ Nobel&#xD;
      Biocare,), a low-cost allograft material, 90 days following exodontia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty-four consecutive subjects requiring extraction of two non-adjacent molars or premolars&#xD;
      located in the same jaw will be selected from the patient pool of the Center for Advanced&#xD;
      Periodontology at the University of Florida, College of Dentistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative Procedures: At the initial screening, the goals of the study, potential risks&#xD;
      and possible benefits will be explained and each subject will be asked to sign a written&#xD;
      consent statement permitting extraction of the involved teeth and the placement of Puros®&#xD;
      allograft and creos™ allograft for ridge preservation. After which a complete medical and&#xD;
      dental history will be obtained, a pregnancy test will be performed, and establishment of&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria will be determined. If meeting all study criteria,&#xD;
      examination periapical radiographs will be taken and each subject will receive oral hygiene&#xD;
      instructions, prophylaxis, and full-arch alginate impressions. The study models will also be&#xD;
      used to fabricate occlusal templates to permit reproducible clinical measurements of the&#xD;
      alveolar ridge dimensions of the residual tooth socket.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical Protocol &amp; Treatment Assessment: To help minimize technical variances in the&#xD;
      surgical treatment protocol, the primary investigator will perform baseline and 12-week&#xD;
      re-entry surgeries. Under local anesthesia, full-thickness mucoperiosteal flaps will be&#xD;
      elevated; the selected teeth will be extracted atraumatically, followed by debridement of the&#xD;
      sockets, and collection of all clinical measurements.The following clinical measurements will&#xD;
      be made at the baseline and re-entry surgeries using standard University of North Carolina&#xD;
      (UNC) manual probes (Hu-Friedy, Chicago, IL):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Facial/buccal thickness (baseline, only)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Distance from the occlusal template to the facial, lingual and crestal bone&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Socket depth (or template to crest distance at the 90-day re-entry surgery)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Osseous dehiscence location and dimension&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Bone density (on re-entry)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgeon will then preserve each site with either Puros® allograft creos™ allograft.&#xD;
      Puros® allograft will be placed into half of the extraction sockets to the level of the&#xD;
      osseous crest. A bovine pericardium membrane (CopiOs ®Pericardium) will be then placed to&#xD;
      cover the bone graft material. Primary closure will be achieved in all cases. The site will&#xD;
      be sutured with 4.0 PTFE sutures. The other extraction sites will receive the same treatment&#xD;
      but with creos™ allograft. Participants will be prescribed a 10 day regimen of Ibuprofen&#xD;
      (2.4g/day) and antibiotics (amoxicillin (1.5g/day) or clindamycin (0.6g/day)) unless other&#xD;
      allergies are present. Subjects will be instructed to change their diet to semi-liquid for 48&#xD;
      hours, followed by soft foods for the first 2-weeks. Subjects will also be instructed to&#xD;
      begin rinsing with warm water, as needed, and to resume their normal oral hygiene routine the&#xD;
      day after surgery in all areas except the surgical site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 2-week post-surgery, the extraction sites will be inspected and gently cleaned with&#xD;
      saline-soaked gauze, health histories will be reviewed, oral hygiene instructions will be&#xD;
      repeated, photographs will be taken; and a plaque score will be recorded. Cone beam CT images&#xD;
      will be performed 2 weeks and 12 weeks post-operative. All imaging will be done using the&#xD;
      Kodak limited view CBCT to minimize the subjects' exposure to radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Soft tissue healing will be assessed at 2, 8 and 12 weeks with a wound-healing index (WHI)&#xD;
      according to the following scheme: score &quot;1&quot; for uneventful wound healing with no gingival&#xD;
      edema, erythema, suppuration, discomfort or graft exposure; score &quot;2&quot; for uneventful wound&#xD;
      healing with slight gingival edema, erythema, or discomfort, but minimal loss of graft and no&#xD;
      suppuration; score &quot;3&quot; for poor wound healing with significant gingival edema, erythema,&#xD;
      discomfort, loss of graft or any suppuration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Re-entry surgery will be performed at 12 weeks, and all clinical measurements will be&#xD;
      repeated. Crestal flapless soft tissue and bone core biopsies approximately 2.7 x 10 mm in&#xD;
      size will be removed with a 3.2 mm trephine drill from the area corresponding to the center&#xD;
      of the previous extraction from the crest of the ridge using the occlusal template as a&#xD;
      guide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cores will be placed in bottles of 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF) for fixation, and&#xD;
      then labeled with a 5-digit number in order to permit masked histomorphometric analysis.&#xD;
      Analysis will be performed in the outer aspect of the bone cores, which correspond to the&#xD;
      bone surface that will contact the dental implants at the time of placement. Zimmer TSTV&#xD;
      implants will be placed at the same time the second re-entry procedure is done. All implants&#xD;
      will be placed according to the manufacturer's specifications. Restorative treatment will be&#xD;
      initiated 90 days after implant placement.&#xD;
