    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of wild-type reovirus (viral&#xD;
      therapy) when given with sargramostim in treating younger patients with high grade brain&#xD;
      tumors that have come back or that have not responded to standard therapy. A virus, called&#xD;
      wild-type reovirus, which has been changed in a certain way, may be able to kill tumor cells&#xD;
      without damaging normal cells. Sargramostim may increase the production of blood cells and&#xD;
      may promote the tumor cell killing effects of wild-type reovirus. Giving wild-type reovirus&#xD;
      together with sargramostim may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and describe the toxicities of wild-type&#xD;
      reovirus (Reolysin) when given once a day for three days following two days of treatment with&#xD;
      sargramostim (GM-CSF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the safety, tolerability and adverse events in the patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the median overall survival time in this patient population. III. To assess the&#xD;
      median progression free survival time in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine whether there is a correlation between antibody responsiveness to the virus&#xD;
      and a positive tumor response to Reolysin in patients who receive the virus following&#xD;
      treatment with GM-CSF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine whether there is a correlation between an increased number of circulating&#xD;
      monocytes and a positive tumor response to Reolysin in patients who receive the virus&#xD;
      following treatment with GM-CSF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To explore the possible predictive value of monocyte numbers in response to Reolysin +&#xD;
      GM-CSF therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of wild-type reovirus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive sargramostim subcutaneously (SC) daily on days 1 and 2 and wild-type&#xD;
      reovirus intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 3-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for&#xD;
      12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year,&#xD;
      every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually for up to 2 years.&#xD;
