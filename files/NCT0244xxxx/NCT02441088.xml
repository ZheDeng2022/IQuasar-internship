      Participants in this research study have tumors that express somatostatin receptors such as a&#xD;
      neuroendocrine tumor, medulloblastoma, meningioma, and neuroblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research study is to determine if 90Y-DOTATOC is an effective treatment&#xD;
      for tumors that express somatostatin receptors and if 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT can measure the&#xD;
      extent of disease and measure response to this therapy. This research will determine if this&#xD;
      process called dosimetry is an effective technique to determine how much 90Y-DOTATOC the&#xD;
      participants can safely receive without damage to their kidneys and bone marrow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goals for this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Demonstrate safety and efficacy of dosimetry-guided peptide receptor radiotherapy (PRRT)&#xD;
           using 90Y-DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide (90Y-DOTATOC) in patients with neuroendocrine and other&#xD;
           somatostatin receptor expressing tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Monitor all adverse events associated with peptide receptor radiotherapy using&#xD;
           90Y-DOTATOC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Establish 68Ga-DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide (68Ga-DOTATOC) PET/CT as an accurate technique for&#xD;
           diagnosis, staging, treatment targeting, and monitoring response to 90Y-DOTATOC therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 64 people will participate in this study conducted at the University of Iowa.&#xD;

&#xD;
         11. The effects of 90Y-DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide on the developing human fetus are unknown. For&#xD;
             this reason and because Class C agents are known to be teratogenic, women and men of&#xD;
             child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier&#xD;
             method of birth control) prior to study entry and for the duration of study&#xD;
             participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while&#xD;
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because 90Y-DOTATOC is a Class C agent&#xD;
             with potential teratogenic or abortifacient effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants&#xD;
             secondary to treatment of the mother with 90Y-DOTATOC, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued until 6 weeks after the last administration of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Surgery within 4 weeks of study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. External beam radiation to both kidneys (scatter doses of &lt;500 cGy to a single kidney&#xD;
             or radiation to &lt; 50% of a single kidney is acceptable).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Prior PRRT with 90Y-DOTATOC (TATE) or 177Lu-DOTATOC (TATE) or 131I-MIBG therapy for&#xD;
             this malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Another investigational drug within 4 weeks of study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Concurrent, malignant disease for which patient is on active therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Another significant medical, psychiatric, or surgical condition which is currently&#xD;
             uncontrolled by treatment and which would likely affect the subject's ability to&#xD;
             complete this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Any subject for whom, in the opinion of their physician, a 12-hour discontinuation of&#xD;
             somatostatin analogue therapy represents a health risk. Also subjects who have&#xD;
             received long-acting somatostatin analogue in the past 28 days or long-acting&#xD;
             lanreotide within the past 16 weeks are excluded. Subjects may be maintained on short&#xD;
             acting octreotide during the time from last injection of long-acting somatostatin&#xD;
             analogue until 12 hrs prior to injection of study drug. Known antibodies to&#xD;
             Octreotide, Lanreotide, or DOTATOC or history of allergic reactions attributed to&#xD;
             compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to 90Y-DOTATOC.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients who have had chemotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or&#xD;
             mitomycin C) of study drug administration or those who have not recovered from adverse&#xD;
             events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Uncontrolled illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active infection,&#xD;
             symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or&#xD;
             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study&#xD;
             requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Subject weighs more than 450 pounds. (Subjects who weigh more than 450 pounds will not&#xD;
             be able to fit inside the imaging machines).&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Inability to lie still for the entire imaging time (due to cough, severe arthritis,&#xD;
             etc.).&#xD;
