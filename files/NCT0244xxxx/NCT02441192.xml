      Background. The cardiovascular and cardiorespiratory coupling (CVCRC), focusing to recognize&#xD;
      the synergies of standard or modified physiology that promote healthy. The investigators aim&#xD;
      to study the effects of different training modalities and detraining on CVCRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods. 32 young males were distributed in four randomized training groups: aerobic (AT),&#xD;
      resistance (RT), aerobic plus resistance (AT+RT) and control (C). They were tested before,&#xD;
      after the training (6 weeks) and after the detraining (3 weeks) through a graded maximal&#xD;
      test. A principal component (PC) analysis of the time series of selected cardiovascular and&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory variables was performed to evaluate the CVCRC. The PC1 coefficient of&#xD;
      congruence in the 3 experimental conditions (before, after training and after detraining) was&#xD;
      calculated for each group.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study of the cardiovascular and cardiorespiratory coupling (CVRC) is a hot topic in the&#xD;
      medical literature focused to recognize the synergies that are present in healthy physiology&#xD;
      [7, 8]. Several effects as aging [9], diseases [8] or mental state interventions [10] on&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory coupling have been investigated, however, although its potential interest,&#xD;
      there are no studies on the effects of training programs and detraining.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two main types of training programs (aerobic- AT and resistance- RT) have been widely&#xD;
      investigated by their important and different physiological effects [11]. Its combination&#xD;
      (AT+RT), has been recently recommended with health purposes for extensive types of population&#xD;
      [12-14].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physiological effects of aerobic training programs has been traditionally evaluated&#xD;
      through the cardiorespiratory reserve and the detection of maximal or threshold subsystem&#xD;
      variables [1]. As a complex adaptive system (CAS), the human organism acts as an indivisible&#xD;
      and integrated whole that cannot be reduced to the sum of its subsystems functions [2]. In&#xD;
      this CAS the cardiovascular and cardiorespiratory subsystems are interdependent and interact&#xD;
      in a dynamic and nonlinear way, i.e. non-proportional, which needs to be approached through&#xD;
      nonlinear models [3], the study of time series and complex systems (CS) methodologies [4]. As&#xD;
      the CAS enter every new situation with an existing set of capabilities [5] and exchange&#xD;
      continuously information with their environment her/his behavior is unique and unexpected at&#xD;
      short term (weeks, months) [6], the usual duration of common training programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to study the couplings and coordination between multiple variables in CAS, CS&#xD;
      approaches propose the detection of the so-called order parameters, collective or&#xD;
      coordinative variables, because they capture the order or coordination of the system [3, 15].&#xD;
      The principal component (PC) analysis is a common statistical technique that has been used to&#xD;
      recognize such coordinative variables in a vast domain of biological research fields like:&#xD;
      motor control [16], brain dynamics [17], DNA replication [18] or protein folding [19]. The PC&#xD;
      analysis reduces the data dimension of highly coupled systems extracting the smallest number&#xD;
      of components that account for most of the variation in the original multivariate data and&#xD;
      summarize it with little loss of information. PCs are extracted in decreasing order of&#xD;
      importance so that the first PC accounts for as much of the variation as possible and each&#xD;
      successive component accounts for a little less [20]. The number of PCs reflects the&#xD;
      dimensionality of the system, being a decrease of the number of PCs indicative of a major&#xD;
      coupling (less dimensions) and vice-versa. The number of PCs changes when the system suffers&#xD;
      a nonlinear change, i.e. a qualitative or coordinative reconfiguration. The PCs technique&#xD;
      applied to kinematic variables has been successfully used to study the effects of motor&#xD;
      learning processes [16], but has not been applied yet to study training effects on&#xD;
      physiological variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this research was to investigate the dimensional changes of the CVCRC before and&#xD;
      after a period of 6 weeks of different training modalities (AT, RT and AT+RT) and 3 weeks&#xD;
      after detraining in healthy young men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Methods Participants. To determine the sample size a power analysis was&#xD;
      performed. Using an effect size of d = .80, alfa &lt; .05, power (1 - beta) = .95, with three&#xD;
      repeated windows, we estimated a sample size = 32 [21]. Thirty-two healthy physically active&#xD;
      males, physical education students (age 21.2 ± 2.4 y., height of 177.1 ± 0.66 cm, mean body&#xD;
      mass 71.0 ± 5.1 kg and mean body -mass index 22.6 ± 1.7 kg·m-2) with no sport specialization&#xD;
      but engaged in a wide range of aerobic activities at least three times a week volunteered to&#xD;
      participate in this study. After the baseline tests they were distributed in four randomized&#xD;
      groups for the 6 weeks of training: aerobic (AT), resistance (RT), aerobic+resistance (AT+RT)&#xD;
      and control (C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure. Participants completed a standard medical questionnaire to confirm their healthy&#xD;
      status and signed an informed consent form. All experimental procedures were approved by the&#xD;
      local bio-ethics committee and were carried out in accordance with the ethical guidelines&#xD;
      laid down in the Helsinki Declaration. After the baseline cardiorespiratory testing and&#xD;
      maximal strength and power tests (see below) they followed 3 times a week their assigned&#xD;
      specific training program:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. AT group (n = 8): they pedalled 60 min at 60% of their individual maximum workload (60%&#xD;
           Wmax). This workload was increased by 5% weekly unless the participant was unable to&#xD;
           keep the pace throughout the session. Heart rate was monitored during all the sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. RT group (n = 8): they performed twice a 30 min strength circuit[14]. Forty per cent of&#xD;
           1RM for the upper body (i.e., squat, chest press, shoulder press, triceps extension,&#xD;
           biceps curl, pull-down [upper back]), and 60% for the lower body (quadriceps extension,&#xD;
           leg press, leg curls [hamstrings], and calf raise) were used as starting weights. They&#xD;
           allowed the participants a maximum of 12 repetitions which included a slow controlled&#xD;
           movement (2s up and 4s down). The resting period between exercises was 2 min. Workloads&#xD;
           were adjusted weekly, with resistance being increased as needed (typically 5 up to 10%)&#xD;
           if the participant was able to lift the weight comfortably (i.e., more than 12&#xD;
           repetitions).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. AT+RT group (n = 8): they pedalled at 60% Wmax during 30 min and performed once the&#xD;
           strength circuit (as R group).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. C group (n = 8): continued with their usual activities, without any special training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiorespiratory testing. The incremental cycling test (Excalibur, Lode, Groningen,&#xD;
      Netherlands) started at 0W and the workload increased 20W/min until exhaustion participants&#xD;
      could not keep the prescribed cycling frequency of 70rpm during more than 5 consecutive&#xD;
      seconds. All tests were performed in a well-ventilated lab; the room temperature was 23ºC and&#xD;
      the relative humidity 48%, with variations of no more than 1ºC in temperature and 10% in&#xD;
      relative humidity. During the test the subjects breathed through a valve (Hans Rudolph 2700,&#xD;
      Kansas City, MO, USA) and respiratory gas exchange was determined using an automated&#xD;
      open-circuit system (Metasys, Brainware, La Valette, France). Oxygen and CO2 content and air&#xD;
      flow rate were recorded breath by breath. Before each trial, the system was calibrated with a&#xD;
      mixture of O2 and CO2 of known composition (O2 15%, CO2 5%, N2 balanced) (Carburos Metálicos,&#xD;
      Barcelona, Spain) and with ambient air. Hemodynamic information of participants was&#xD;
      determined with non-invasive finger cuff technology (Nexfin, BMEYE Amsterdam, Netherlands).&#xD;
      The Nexfin device provides continuous blood pressure (BP) monitoring from the resulting pulse&#xD;
      pressure waveform, and calculates: systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP).&#xD;
      Participants were connected by wrapping an inflatable cuff around the middle phalanx of the&#xD;
      finger. The finger artery pulsing is 'fixed' to a constant volume by application of an&#xD;
      equivalent change in pressure against the blood pressure resulting in a waveform of the&#xD;
      pressure (clamp volume method). Electrocardiogram (ECG) was continuously monitored (DMS&#xD;
      Systems, DMS-BTT wireless Bluetooth ECG transmitter and receiver, software DMS Version 4.0,&#xD;
      Beijing, China). The tests were carried out at least 3 hours after a light meal and&#xD;
      participants were instructed not to perform any vigorous physical activity for 72 hours&#xD;
      before testing. Participants repeated this test after 6 weeks of training and after 3 weeks&#xD;
      of detraining.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maximal strength and power testing. Maximal strength and maximal power of upper and lower&#xD;
      limbs, respectively, were measured (Musclelab Power System, Porsgruun, Norway) in each&#xD;
      participant. Estimated 1 RM-chest press and 1RM-squat based on submaximal loads was&#xD;
      calculated. In the chest press exercise the load started with 25 kg, and continued with 35&#xD;
      kg, 45 kg, 55 kg, 65 kg, etc. and in the squat exercise they started with 45 kg and continued&#xD;
      with 65 kg, 85 kg, 105 kg, etc. until they could not perform 1 repetition. Based on these&#xD;
      results the maximal 1RM was registered and the force/velocity relationship graph was plotted&#xD;
      to determine the maximal power.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All exercise tests were carried out at least 3 hours after a light meal and participants were&#xD;
      instructed not to perform any vigorous physical activity for 72 hours before testing.&#xD;
      Participants repeated these tests after 6 weeks of training and after 3 weeks of detraining.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis The following maximal values of performance and cardiorespiratory variables&#xD;
      were registered during the tests: maximal cycling workload (Wmax), maximal oxygen uptake (VO2&#xD;
      max), maximal expiratory ventilation per minute (VE max), maximal heart rate (HR max),&#xD;
      maximal 1RM-squat and maximal 1RM-chest. The group means in the different conditions were&#xD;
      compared using the non-parametric Friedman.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A PC analysis of the time series of the following selected cardiorespiratory variables:&#xD;
      expired fraction of O2 (FeO2), expired fraction of CO2 (FeCO2), ventilation (VE), systolic&#xD;
      blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR) was performed to&#xD;
      obtain information about the CVCRC in each participant. The median of PC1 coefficient of&#xD;
      congruence was obtained in each group and condition (before, after training and detraining).&#xD;
      The null hypothesis of a constant PC congruence median over the control group and the&#xD;
      training groups was tested through non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis. Mann Whitney U matched&#xD;
      pairs test analysis was also performed to assess statistically significant differences&#xD;
      between each couple of different conditions. Effect sizes (Cohen's d) were computed to&#xD;
      demonstrate the magnitude of standardized medians' differences where effects reached p &lt; .05&#xD;
      level.&#xD;
