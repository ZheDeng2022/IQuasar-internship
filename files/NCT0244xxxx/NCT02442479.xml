      Resistance training has shown the most promise among interventions aimed to combat aging&#xD;
      muscle atrophy as it enhances strength, power, and mobility function, but induces varying&#xD;
      degrees of skeletal muscle hypertrophy as the investigators demonstrated in the initial&#xD;
      5-year funding period of this award (2001-2006). In the subsequent 5-year funding period&#xD;
      (2007-2012), the investigators built on this prior work by using a dose-response approach in&#xD;
      older adults - ultimately to optimize the treatment of age-related muscle atrophy. The&#xD;
      investigators tested four, long-term resistance training prescriptions in older (60-75 yr)&#xD;
      women and men to determine which prescription maximizes mechanisms driving muscle regrowth.&#xD;
      One of the innovations in this project was the use of a 4-wk pre-training program to reach a&#xD;
      plateau in the early, non-muscle mass adaptations, thereby establishing a true baseline from&#xD;
      which both mechanisms of measurable muscle hypertrophy and functional consequences of&#xD;
      hypertrophy could be studied in a tightly integrated fashion without bias in the subsequent&#xD;
      experimental period. A randomized design was used to test the overarching hypothesis that a&#xD;
      novel program of mixed strength and power training would optimize the anabolic environment to&#xD;
      promote muscle hypertrophy and robust gains in performance. This hypothesis was tested with&#xD;
      three specific aims.&#xD;

      Resistance training has shown the most promise among interventions aimed to combat aging&#xD;
      muscle atrophy as it enhances strength, power, and mobility function, but induces varying&#xD;
      degrees of skeletal muscle hypertrophy as we demonstrated in the initial 5-year funding&#xD;
      period of this award (2001-2006). In the subsequent 5-year funding period (2007-2012), we&#xD;
      built on this prior work by using a dose-response approach in older adults - ultimately to&#xD;
      optimize the treatment of age-related muscle atrophy. We tested four, long-term resistance&#xD;
      training prescriptions in older (60-75 yr) women and men to determine which prescription&#xD;
      maximizes mechanisms driving muscle regrowth (protein synthesis and myonuclear addition). One&#xD;
      of the innovations in this project was the use of a 4-wk pre-training program to reach a&#xD;
      plateau in the early, non-muscle mass adaptations, thereby establishing a true baseline from&#xD;
      which both mechanisms of measurable muscle hypertrophy and functional consequences of&#xD;
      hypertrophy could be studied in a tightly integrated fashion without bias in the subsequent&#xD;
      experimental period. A randomized design was used to test the overarching hypothesis that a&#xD;
      novel program of mixed strength and power training would optimize the anabolic environment to&#xD;
      promote muscle hypertrophy and robust gains in performance. This hypothesis was tested with&#xD;
      three specific aims.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1. We determined the effects of manipulating intensity, recovery, and mode of&#xD;
      contraction on rates of muscle hypertrophy and muscle mass-dependent improvements in tests of&#xD;
      in vivo muscle performance among older women and men. In brief, the four training models&#xD;
      were: (1) traditional high-resistance concentric-eccentric training (H) 3 d/wk (HHH3); (2)&#xD;
      high-resistance concentric-eccentric training 2 d/wk (HH2); (3) 3 d/wk mixed model consisting&#xD;
      of high-resistance concentric-eccentric training 2 d/wk separated by 1 bout of&#xD;
      low-resistance, high-velocity, concentric only training (L) (HLH3); and (4) 2 d/wk mixed&#xD;
      model consisting of high-resistance concentric-eccentric training 1 d/wk and low-resistance,&#xD;
      high-velocity, concentric only training 1 d/wk (HL2). For Aim 1, we hypothesized that the&#xD;
      HLH3 prescription would prove optimal overall for combined gains in muscle mass, strength,&#xD;
      power, and fatigue resistance in both women and men, while HL2 would be the least effective&#xD;
      program due to insufficient weekly loading.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2. Myofiber hypertrophy requires net muscle protein synthesis, and advanced&#xD;
      fiber expansion is facilitated by nuclear addition. We are conducting a comprehensive&#xD;
      evaluation of: (1) key regulatory steps in the protein synthesis/degradation machinery; and&#xD;
      (2) myonuclear addition and satellite cell activation/cell cycle regulation. Quantitative&#xD;
      relationships between metabolic/molecular responses and the magnitude of muscle hypertrophy&#xD;
      among older adults will enable us to identify underlying factors that respond differently to&#xD;
      these four resistance training models, potentially in a gender-specific manner, thus&#xD;
      revealing important processes that drive the hypertrophy adaptation. We hypothesized that&#xD;
      muscle protein synthesis and myonuclear addition, along with key underlying regulatory&#xD;
      processes, would be most favorably affected by the work-recovery cycle of 2 d/wk&#xD;
      high-resistance loading (HLH3 and HH2 models), thereby optimizing the anabolic environment&#xD;
      for muscle hypertrophy in both older women and men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3. To translate the findings under Aim 1 to clinically important outcomes, we&#xD;
      determined the degree to which non-traditional resistance training programs lead to&#xD;
      improvements in mobility function and weight-bearing exercise difficulty. We hypothesized&#xD;
      that a less stressful weekly training regimen consisting of fewer high-resistance&#xD;
      contractions (HLH3) and/or fewer training sessions (HH2) while achieving substantial&#xD;
      hypertrophy would promote equal or better improvements in mobility function and&#xD;
      weight-bearing exercise difficulty than the traditionally prescribed HHH3 program.&#xD;
