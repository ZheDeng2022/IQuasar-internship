  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ROHHAD (rapid onset obesity, hypothalamic dysfunction, hypoventilation, and autonomic&#xD;
      dysregulation) syndrome is a rare pediatric disorder associated with a cancer called&#xD;
      neuroblastoma and presumed to be driven by an attack of the immune system on specific area in&#xD;
      the brain. Patients develop severe symptoms and often succumb to this disease. Based on the&#xD;
      researchers' experience the investigators conduct a clinical trial to study intensive&#xD;
      immunosuppression with high-dose cyclophosphamide in these patients. In addition to&#xD;
      describing the symptomatic improvement, the investigators' trial seeks to define objective&#xD;
      markers of disease activity.&#xD;

      Baseline evaluation will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep study and pulmonary evaluation Hormone levels Determination of up to 6 key&#xD;
      ROHHAD-related symptoms to be followed Hyperphagia questionnaire&#xD;
      18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)&#xD;
      scan Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be treated with cyclophosphamide, 50 mg/kg (ideal body weight)/dose daily for 4&#xD;
      days, with Mesna and hydration as prophylaxis against hemorrhagic cystitis. Supportive care&#xD;
      will include mucosal care, transfusions, infection prophylaxis, and empiric treatment for&#xD;
      febrile neutropenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Composite severity score will be assessed to measure response of key symptoms, and formal&#xD;
      neuropsychological testing, sleep study, and hormone studies will be performed.&#xD;
