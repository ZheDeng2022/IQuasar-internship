  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In metastasized of locally advanced breast cancer patients, local problems often occur like&#xD;
      skin metastases, ulcerations or lymph node metastases. These problems are related to a worse&#xD;
      quality of life, while overall survival is generally in the order of months to years.&#xD;
      Treatment of these lesions is challenging, especially after failure of first or second line&#xD;
      systemic therapy. Local treatments, like radiation, are able to give short-term palliation,&#xD;
      but the effect is often disappointing in the long run. Therefore, the search for new&#xD;
      therapeutic strategies like the combination of local and systemic treatments is emerging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent investigations clearly show that radiation is capable of inducing a systemic&#xD;
      anti-tumor response. Both in mouse models and in patients, it was reported that irradiating&#xD;
      one metastasis can slow down the growth of other non-irradiated metastases. This effect is&#xD;
      called the &quot;abscopal effect&quot; and is immune-mediated. There are also several chemotherapeutics&#xD;
      that are capable of influencing the immune response like cyclophosphamide. Cyclophosphamide&#xD;
      is a known inducer of immunogenic cell death, which leads to the activation of dendritic&#xD;
      cells and thus the presentation of antigens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this pilot study the investigators wish to identify the immunological effects of combined&#xD;
      treatment with radiation and cyclophosphamide in breast cancer patients. Five patients with&#xD;
      metastasized breast carcinoma will be treated with the combined treatment and the&#xD;
      immunological effects will be monitored using repeat blood draws and biopsies. These effects&#xD;
      will be correlated to the clinical response.&#xD;
