      Background There is limited evidence indicating that specific immunotherapy in elderly&#xD;
      patients is safe and effective. This study was performed to evaluate the safety and efficacy&#xD;
      of specific subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) against grass pollen allergens in patients over&#xD;
      60 years of age with seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) and a confirmed allergy to grass&#xD;
      pollen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective This study assessed the safety and efficacy of SCIT for grass pollen allergens in&#xD;
      elderly patients with SAR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods This study included 62 60- to 75-year-old patients with SAR and grass pollen allergy&#xD;
      confirmed using a skin prick test, nasal provocation, and serum IgE measurement. The patients&#xD;
      were individually randomized to the active or placebo groups using a double-blinded method.&#xD;
      There were 33 subjects in the SCIT group (Purethal, Grass pollen, HAL Allergy B.V, Leiden,&#xD;
      Netherlands) and 29 subjects in the placebo group monitored for three years. The patients&#xD;
      were required to record each use of anti-allergy medication in a diary and use a visual&#xD;
      graphic scale. The main outcome measure was the area under the curve (AUC) for the combined&#xD;
      symptom and medication score (SMS).&#xD;

      Methods Patients A total of 109 patients ranging from 60 to 70 years of age were recruited&#xD;
      from the outpatient allergy clinic to assess their eligibility for inclusion in the study.&#xD;
      The subjects had moderate or severe intermittent allergic rhinitis and fulfilled the ARIA&#xD;
      criterion. Additionally, the patients included in the study all had a positive skin prick&#xD;
      test (SPT), were positive for specific immunoglobulin E (sIgE), and had positive nasal&#xD;
      provocation tests (NPTs) with grass pollen mixture allergens. Patients with any of the&#xD;
      following characteristics were excluded from the study: hypersensitivity to other allergens,&#xD;
      bronchial asthma, non-allergic rhinitis (especially senile or vasomotor rhinitis) and severe&#xD;
      non-stable diseases. However, patients with stable coronary disease, diabetes, and arterial&#xD;
      hypertension were permitted in the study. All subjects were required to abstain from&#xD;
      anti-allergy drugs and glucocorticoid nasal drops for at least 6 weeks prior to the start of&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There were 62 patients individually randomized in comparable numbers to one of two &quot;parallel&quot;&#xD;
      groups using a double-blind method. The groups were the active (n=33) treatment group and the&#xD;
      placebo (n=29) group. There were 31 subjects in the SCIT group and 25 subjects in the placebo&#xD;
      group that completed the three-year observation period. The groups were comparable at&#xD;
      baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic procedures A careful examination of the eyes, ears, nose, and throat was performed&#xD;
      on all patients. The severity of seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) was assessed using the&#xD;
      Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) guidelines. The patients with other nasal&#xD;
      problems such as chronic nasal obstruction, reduced olfaction, bacterial colonization, and&#xD;
      chronic sinusitis were diagnosed based on a CT scan and nasal endoscopy. Several patients&#xD;
      were excluded from further observation as a result of these problems. The subjects with other&#xD;
      chronic or acute clinical disorders or with a history of respiratory tract infections within&#xD;
      four weeks of the study initiation were also excluded. The SPT was performed using inhalant&#xD;
      allergens (HAL Allergy B.V, Leiden, Netherlands) from the following panel: D. pteronyssinus,&#xD;
      D. farinae, mixed 5 grasses (Phleum pratense, Dactylis glomerata, Anthoxanthum odoratum,&#xD;
      Lolium perenne, and Poa pratensis), mixed tree, mugwort, Alternaria, Cladosporium, dog and&#xD;
      cat allergens. There were also positive (10 mg/ml of histamine) and negative (saline)&#xD;
      controls included. A grass pollen allergy was defined as having positive skin tests for 5&#xD;
      grass pollen allergens with a minimum wheal diameter of at least 3 mm greater than the&#xD;
      negative control. The patients with negative tests for histamine sensitivity were excluded&#xD;
      from further analyses. The sIgE reactivity to the single grass pollen allergen components&#xD;
      (Phl p1, Phl p2, Phl p5, Phl p6, Phl p7 and Phl p12) was determined using ImmunoCAP (Phadia&#xD;
      AB, Uppsala, Sweden) tests. The results were considered positive when the sIgE concentration&#xD;
      was greater than 0.35 IU/ml (according to the manufacturer's instructions). NPTs were&#xD;
      conducted using active anterior rhinomanometry with commercial grass pollen mixture&#xD;
      allergens. The concentration was 10,000 AU/ml and the mixture was delivered as 1 puff per&#xD;
      nostril (HAL Allergy B.V, Leiden, Netherlands) using the methods described by Bachert et al.&#xD;
      and Dordal et al. A reduction in the peak nasal inspiratory flow greater than or equal to 40%&#xD;
      and an increase in symptoms greater than or equal to 5 points were considered to be positive&#xD;
      NPT criteria by Bachert et al. and Dordal et al. The NPTs were also repeated after three&#xD;
      years of treatment. The patients monosensitized to grass pollen were included in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatments The patients were randomly selected to receive Purethal Grasses 20,000 AUM/ml&#xD;
      (pollen mixture extract solution of Agrostis stolonifera, Anthoxanthum odoratum,&#xD;
      Arrhenatherum elatius, Dactylis glomerata, Festuca rubra, Holcus lanatus, Lolium perenne,&#xD;
      Phleum pratense, Poa pratensis, Secale cereal, Loe edasi HAL Allergy B.V, Leiden,&#xD;
      Netherlands) or placebo. The recruitment period was limited to three months&#xD;
      (October-December). Purethal grasses (January-April) were administered as pre-seasonal&#xD;
      therapy using the following regimen: 1 dose- 0.1 ml, 2 dose - 0.2 ml, 3 dose - 0.4 ml every&#xD;
      week, and doses 4- 7 consisted of 0.5 ml every two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using this schedule the average cumulative dose was 460,500 BAU (Bioequivalent Allergy Unit),&#xD;
      which contains approximately 690 Î¼g of Phl p5 administered to each patient undergoing active&#xD;
      treatment for all three years of the study. The study consisted of two phases. The first&#xD;
      phase was the baseline one season of follow-up visits without treatment and the second phase&#xD;
      was three years of SCIT or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of efficacy The prime outcome measure was the area under the curve (AUC) for&#xD;
      combined symptom and medication score (SMS) over the grass pollen season for baseline 2010&#xD;
      (before treatment) and in 2011, 2012 and finally in 2013 after three years of SCIT. The&#xD;
      patients recorded symptom severity in a daily diary during the pollen season (May-August) by&#xD;
      scoring the following areas: nasal itching, sneezing, running, blockage, and ocular itch on a&#xD;
      separate Visual Analog Scale (VAS) with a continuous scale from 0 cm (no symptoms) to 10 cm&#xD;
      (very severe symptoms). The rescue medication provided and scoring was a one point per spray&#xD;
      for Azelastine nasal spray or eye drops (Levocabastine), or per 5 mg levocetirizine tablet.&#xD;
      The score was two points per puff for mometasone fuorate nasal spray and three points per&#xD;
      prednisolone 10 mg tablet. This combined symptom-medication score was calculated as a sum of&#xD;
      the symptom score and medication score monitored daily with the use a diary as described. The&#xD;
      SMS was derived by adding the VAS for each of these five symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcome measures included quality of life, reduction of symptoms score, safety&#xD;
      assessment and monitoring of IgG4. The local reactions were assessed at 30 min after&#xD;
      injection and measured in cm. The systemic reactions were graded according to EAACI criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum IgG4 measurements The serum concentration of IgG4 against birch alder and hazel pollens&#xD;
      were determined in blood serum by ELISA tests according Lai et al. before and after the&#xD;
      three-year SIT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life Patient quality of life was evaluated with the RQLQ score for adults using&#xD;
      questionnaires every grass pollen season during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pollen counts The local grass pollen counts were determined by volumetric pollen trap&#xD;
      (Burkard, Scientific Ltd, Uxbridge, UK). The peak pollen count was defined as the day with&#xD;
      highest grass pollen count for each season 3 weeks before and 3 weeks after the peak grass&#xD;
      pollen count.&#xD;
