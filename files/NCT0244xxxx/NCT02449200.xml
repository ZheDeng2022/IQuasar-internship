  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multimodal physiotherapy involving manual therapy and exercise has demonstrated a positive&#xD;
      effect on pain and disability in sub-acute and chronic cervical radiculopathy (CR) but a&#xD;
      research gap exists for optimal management in the first 12 weeks and short-term natural&#xD;
      history of the condition is unclear, although thought to be favourable within the first 4&#xD;
      weeks. The primary aim of this single blind, 2 group randomised controlled trial (RCT) is to&#xD;
      investigate the effects of a 4 week (6-8 sessions) programme of manual therapy, exercise and&#xD;
      upper limb unloading tape compared to advice to stay active, on disability, pain and other&#xD;
      biopsychosocial measures, in acute / sub-acute cervical radiculopathy patients. The&#xD;
      hypothesis is that a 4 week multimodal physiotherapy programme will lead to changes in&#xD;
      self-reported disability and pain, compared to advice to stay active, in patients with acute&#xD;
      / sub-acute cervical radiculopathy. A secondary study objective is to identify whether&#xD;
      variables from the baseline examination, group allocation and aetiology confirmed by MRI can&#xD;
      predict outcome, as measured with the Global Rating of Change Scale (GROC). Subjects will be&#xD;
      diagnosed with CR based on a diagnostic clinical prediction rule. Random group allocation,&#xD;
      allocation concealment, blinded assessment and intention to treat analysis will be employed.&#xD;
      Outcomes will be measured at baseline, 4 and 12 weeks. Patients' report of pain, disability&#xD;
      and their rating of recovery will also be recorded by telephone interview at 6 months. An&#xD;
      internal pilot feasibility study will be undertaken in advance of the main study to test&#xD;
      recruitment and retention strategies. Statistical analysis of differences between groups will&#xD;
      be done with ANOVAs and MANOVAs. Appropriate multivariable regression analysis will be used&#xD;
      to explore predictors of outcome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cervical radiculopathy (CR) has been defined by the North American Spine Society (NASS) as&#xD;
      pain in a radicular pattern in one or both upper extremities related to compression and/or&#xD;
      irritation of one or more cervical nerve roots, with signs and symptoms including varying&#xD;
      degrees of sensory, motor, and reflex changes in addition to dysaesthesia and paraesthesia&#xD;
      (Bono et al. 2011). CR is of particular clinical concern, given the higher levels of pain and&#xD;
      disability associated with the presence of nerve-related arm pain resulting in higher&#xD;
      healthcare costs for this cohort of people with neck pain (Rubinstein et al., 2007, Haldeman&#xD;
      et al., 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multimodal physiotherapy involving manual therapy and exercise has demonstrated a positive&#xD;
      effect on pain and disability for chronic (symptom duration &gt; 3 months) CR (Boyles et al.,&#xD;
      2011). No consensus on the optimum conservative management, or indeed optimal timing of such&#xD;
      management, currently exists for acute / sub-acute cervical radiculopathy. The combined use&#xD;
      of manual therapy with exercise for this cohort is now garnering interest; evident by the&#xD;
      emergence of several randomised controlled trials (Nee et al., 2012, Langevin et al., 2015)&#xD;
      involving treatment duration of 2-4 weeks. Langevin et al. (2015) demonstrated that using 2&#xD;
      varied programmes of manual therapy &amp; exercise, led to similarly clinically significant&#xD;
      improvements in pain and disability, particularly immediately after a 4 week intervention.&#xD;
      However, without a 'no treatment' control group, natural recovery could not be excluded,&#xD;
      confirming the need for adequate control groups in future trials (Langevin et al., 2015). The&#xD;
      most recent Cochrane review of exercise for the treatment of mechanical neck disorders (MND)&#xD;
      (including CR) concluded that there was low quality evidence to suggest a small pain&#xD;
      reduction benefit with cervical stretch / strengthening / stabilization exercises in the&#xD;
      short term in acute cervical radiculopathy (Gross et al., 2015). They also advocated for&#xD;
      larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods in future trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomised controlled trial of a 4 week course of a multimodal physiotherapy package&#xD;
      (manual therapy (to spinal joints), exercise (mobility exercise, deep neck flexor and&#xD;
      scapular muscle training), upper limb unloading tape (to offload the brachial plexus) and&#xD;
      advice to stay active) for acute/sub-acute CR is proposed. As there is no strong evidence&#xD;
      establishing best clinical practice for the conservative management of acute/sub-acute CR, a&#xD;
      control group of advice to stay active and medication will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims &amp; Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this trial is to investigate the effects of a 4 week multimodal&#xD;
      physiotherapy (MP) programme on neck and arm pain and resulting disability in CR, over 6&#xD;
      months, with the primary endpoint at 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to investigate the effects of the MP programme on the following additional&#xD;
           biopsychosocial outcome measures;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cervical range of motion&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Upper Limb Neurodynamic Test (ULNT) 1&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Pressure Pain Thresholds (PPT)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Quality of Life&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Anxiety and Depression&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Fear Avoidance beliefs&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patient rating of recovery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to identify whether any of the above biopsychosocial outcome measures, as well as the&#xD;
           PainDETECT at baseline, symptom duration and group allocation; can predict outcome at 3&#xD;
           months, on the GROC scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 4 week multimodal physiotherapy programme will lead to changes in self-reported disability&#xD;
      and pain, compared to advice to stay active, for acute / sub-acute cervical radiculopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An exploratory, assessor-blinded, randomised controlled trial is planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A consecutive sample of all new (non-urgent) patients with cervical radiculopathy referred by&#xD;
      their general practitioner for neurosurgical assessment to Beaumont Hospital are being&#xD;
      recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility assessment includes a neurological exam and manual exam of the cervical spine&#xD;
      (C2-T2) to identify the nerve root level and to guide the treating physiotherapists for those&#xD;
      participants subsequently assigned to the intervention group. If eligible and upon providing&#xD;
      written consent, prior to baseline assessment and random group allocation, each participant&#xD;
      will be asked by the PI about their beliefs regarding the likely effectiveness of&#xD;
      physiotherapy, as well as their belief in the need for surgery. Participants will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to the intervention or control group by an independent academic colleague using a&#xD;
      computer-generated list of random numbers with a random block size of 4, 6 or 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants allocated to the control group will be advised to continue taking their&#xD;
      prescribed or over the counter medication, as well as to stay active, by the treating&#xD;
      physiotherapist. They will be telephoned weekly for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants allocated to the intervention group will attend the Physiotherapy Department of&#xD;
      Beaumont Hospital or Collins Avenue Physiotherapy clinic for a 4 week programme of&#xD;
      multi-modal physiotherapy involving advice, manual therapy, exercise and upper limb unloading&#xD;
      tape, as decided by the treating physiotherapist from a best-practice physiotherapy treatment&#xD;
      guide. Participants in the intervention group will be treated twice a week for 30 minutes&#xD;
      each session and receive non-provocative manual therapy (all participants will receive&#xD;
      lateral glide mobilisation (Vicenzino et al., 1999) to the mechanical interface of the&#xD;
      radiculopathy and additional Maitland joint mobilisation to the segmental levels above or&#xD;
      below (as far as T4) as deemed necessary by the treating physiotherapist based on their&#xD;
      mobility assessment), exercise (all participants will receive deep neck flexor strengthening&#xD;
      and scapular orientation exercise as deemed necessary by the treating physiotherapist based&#xD;
      on their motor control assessment (Jull et al., 2008)) and cervical mobility exercises. Upper&#xD;
      limb neural unloading tape will be applied at the end of the treatment session. The tape will&#xD;
      run from the upper arm, over the top of the shoulder and across to the back of the neck and&#xD;
      will unload the brachial plexus. Experienced senior physiotherapists with a master's degree&#xD;
      in musculoskeletal physiotherapy (or equivalent) will provide the treatment programme.&#xD;
      Treating physiotherapists will also record the participants' adherence with a home exercise&#xD;
      programme by administering a weekly exercise adherence questionnaire to monitor the&#xD;
      participant's home exercise frequency per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medication usage of participants in both groups will be monitored on a weekly basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the case of a significant adverse event (progressive neurological signs e.g. multilevel or&#xD;
      bilateral radiculopathy, myotomal paresis &lt; 4/5 on MRC scale; or emerging medical red flags&#xD;
      or cervical spondylotic myelopathy) during the trial, an appropriate clinical pathway will be&#xD;
      followed. The clinical change will be discussed with the neurosurgical registrar and&#xD;
      requirement for a fast track clinical review will be determined. Minor adverse events will&#xD;
      also be recorded during the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants from both groups will be assessed by the principal investigator at the end of&#xD;
      treatment at 4 weeks and again at 12 weeks. Participants' report of pain and disability and&#xD;
      their rating of recovery will also be recorded by telephone interview at 6 months. Baseline&#xD;
      demographics will be recorded including co-morbidities, educational level, smoking status,&#xD;
      occupation and work status and any change in to work status at subsequent assessment time&#xD;
      points will be noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked not to pursue other treatment during the trial, until after the 12&#xD;
      week assessment. All other interventions received will be recorded at the 6 months telephone&#xD;
      follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size estimation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NDI and the NPRS are the co-primary outcome measures for this study and sample size&#xD;
      estimates were carried out for both outcome measures. An MCID for the NDI of 7 has been&#xD;
      determined for cervical radiculopathy patients (Cleland et al., 2006). Using a reported NDI&#xD;
      SD of 9.2 (Cleland et al., 2006) for this patient group, with a two-sided 5% significance&#xD;
      level and a power of 80%, a sample size of 29 participants per group will be necessary. An&#xD;
      MCID for the NPRS of 2 has been determined for mechanical neck pain, including cervical&#xD;
      radiculopathy (Cleland et al., 2008) and a SD of 1.85 (Cleland et al., 2006). Using these&#xD;
      figures, with a two-sided 5% significance level and a power of 80%, a sample size of 15 per&#xD;
      group was calculated. The larger sample size per group calculated using the NDI was chosen&#xD;
      and an additional 10% was added to account for anticipated dropout. In total, a sample size&#xD;
      of 64 participants will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pilot feasibility study will be undertaken, with the objectives of testing the recruitment&#xD;
      strategy and retention rates of the study. The pilot study will mirror the protocol of the&#xD;
      main study except the assessment time points will be limited to baseline and 4 weeks (at the&#xD;
      end of treatment for the intervention group) and the pilot will run for 2 months or until the&#xD;
      first 6 participants have reached their 4 week assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for assessing success of this feasibility study (Thabane et al., 2010) will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6 participants can be recruited per month. To recruit the sample size estimate over a 12&#xD;
           month period, more than 5 participants per month will need to be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete follow-up is possible in at least 95% of all recruited participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pilot study will also identify if a difference in retention rates exists between groups,&#xD;
      by following participants until the 4 week assessment point. Participants in the control&#xD;
      group will also be asked how acceptable they would find continuing with medication and advice&#xD;
      to stay active for a further 8 weeks, to assess the likelihood of dropout before the second&#xD;
      and third assessment time points. Results from the pilot study will be included in the main&#xD;
      study results if no further significant protocol changes are required after the pilot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second recruitment pathway, via direct general practitioner (GP) referral from primary care&#xD;
      commenced during the pilot in October 2015, as it was clear the initial recruitment strategy&#xD;
      was inadequate. This pathway was approved by the Irish College of General Practitioners&#xD;
      Research Ethics Committee in September 2015. Five physiotherapy treatment sites are now&#xD;
      providing the intervention across the greater Dublin area. An additional private&#xD;
      physiotherapy practice site was added in January 2016 and 3 further physiotherapy practice&#xD;
      sites were added in September 2016, in order to roll out the trial across Dublin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline demographic characteristics and all outcome measures will be described and presented&#xD;
      for both groups following the CONSORT Statement. Data will be checked for normality using the&#xD;
      Shapiro-Wilk test. Marginal effects will be used to calculate effect sizes for specified&#xD;
      values for baseline differences between the 2 groups. Poisson regression will be used where&#xD;
      data are non-parametric.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will include two-way (treatment x time) ANOVAs and MANOVAs for between&#xD;
      and within-group differences and interactions. Intention to treat analysis will be the&#xD;
      primary approach employed. A secondary per protocol analysis will also be undertaken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary analysis to explore if any of the outcome measures or group allocation are&#xD;
      predictors of outcome (GROC score at 3 months) will be performed using appropriate&#xD;
      multivariable regression analysis.&#xD;
