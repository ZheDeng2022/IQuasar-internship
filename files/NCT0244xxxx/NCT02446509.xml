  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bipolar disorder is a debilitating chronic illness characterized by periods of elation and&#xD;
      depression. Since deinstitutionalization of the mentally ill over 40 years ago, families have&#xD;
      become major caregivers for patients with bipolar disorder . This illness imposes a&#xD;
      substantial and chronic burden on family caregivers Despite their persistent stress and&#xD;
      burden, these caregivers have been largely ignored. Interventions to help them have been very&#xD;
      limited. One comprehensive intervention was developed and implemented by Miklowitz (2008) and&#xD;
      has shown to be effective in reducing caregiver depression and improving health outcomes.&#xD;
      However, this intervention and is highly complex, long, and was given on an individual basis,&#xD;
      significantly raising the cost of the program. One core component of the Miklowitz (2008)&#xD;
      intervention is psychoeducation, which provides the fundamental support and information&#xD;
      needed to caregivers on an individual basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this pilot study, the intervention group will receive 7 weekly psychoeducation sessions.&#xD;
      After completion of these sessions in the intervention group, the wait list control group&#xD;
      will receive the same weekly sessions. In this study, the investigators plan to test the&#xD;
      feasibility and potential efficacy of this specific psychoeducation intervention implemented&#xD;
      in a group setting. The investigators will also examine the effects of this psychosocial&#xD;
      intervention on biological mechanisms (cortisol and inflammatory biomarkers) and health&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Test the feasibility of implementing a 7-week group psychoeducation program for family&#xD;
           caregivers of patients with bipolar disorder by assessing recruitment and retention&#xD;
           rates, attendance, satisfaction with the program, and data and sample collection rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Explore the effect of the intervention on caregiver outcomes (depression, burden, health&#xD;
           status, mental wellbeing, cortisol, interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6 levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will be delivered by at the University of Texas Health Science Center at&#xD;
      Houston Center of Excellence for Mood Disorders (CEMD) and at the University of Texas Health&#xD;
      Science Center at Houston School of Nursing. Forty family caregivers of patients with bipolar&#xD;
      disorder will be recruited into the study.&#xD;
