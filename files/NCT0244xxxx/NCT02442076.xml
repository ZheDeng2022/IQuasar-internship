  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Skin tremor induced by artery pulses are usually sensed by doctor's fingers in Traditional&#xD;
      Chinese Medicine(TCM). On the other hand, vibration of acupuncture needle was also stated by&#xD;
      Huang Di Nei Jing (Yellow Emperor). However; the characteristics of skin tremor and its&#xD;
      correlation with vibrating acupuncture needles, how the skin tremor and vibration of needles&#xD;
      varies from area to area, are not yet clarified.In this study, the abovementioned issues will&#xD;
      be investigated experimentally through non-invasive method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 10 healthy volunteers, aged 20~65, will be recruited. The investigators will measure&#xD;
      the needle and the skin tremor by video optical microscopy. The variation of skin tremor and&#xD;
      needle vibration and their spectra will be analyzed digitally. The model correlating skin&#xD;
      tremor, needle vibration and basic physiological parameters will be constructed.The fact that&#xD;
      the skin tremor and the needle vibration come from the same origin is expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However; due to the leverage effects and different dynamical responses to the source&#xD;
      vibrations at different frequencies, needle vibration might exhibit some difference from skin&#xD;
      vibration in their power spectra. This study should be able to construct a clear model of the&#xD;
      possible vibration sources such as heartbeat and breathing, the area dependence of&#xD;
      vibrations, the correlation between the skin and the needle vibrations, and the correlation&#xD;
      with other physiological parameters.&#xD;
