  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Experimental studies and previous clinical trials suggest neuroprotective effects of GLP-1&#xD;
      analogs in various degenerative neurological diseases, and in hypoxic brain injuries in&#xD;
      experimental designs. This study is designed as a safety and feasibility study with patients&#xD;
      randomized 1:1 to receive GLP-1 analogs immediately after hospital admission after out of&#xD;
      hospital cardiac arrest.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In comatose patients resuscitated from out of hospital cardiac arrest, neurological injuries&#xD;
      remain the leading cause of death. The in-hospital mortality is reported at 30-50%, and the&#xD;
      total mortality, although improved substantially over the last decade, remain to be&#xD;
      significant, in most countries up to 90%. The brain of a patient resuscitated after cardiac&#xD;
      arrest (CA) may have suffered ischemia and when the spontaneous circulation is&#xD;
      re-established, the subsequent reperfusion may cause further damage. Brain ischemia and the&#xD;
      reperfusion injury lead to tissue degeneration and loss of neurological function, the extent&#xD;
      dependent on duration and density of the insult. Temperature control and mild induced&#xD;
      hypothermia (MIH) (33-36°C) mitigate this damage in the experimental setting and clinical&#xD;
      trials have shown promising results in improving neurological function and survival. Recent&#xD;
      large scale clinical trials however have investigated milder degree of hypothermia in this&#xD;
      setting, which suggest a role for active neuroprotection outside of temperature management.&#xD;
      Also recently, increased attention to the possible role of Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) in&#xD;
      neuroprotection has been raised, both in the context of ameliorating degenerative disease and&#xD;
      in reducing inflammation on ischemic cerebral stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several experimental studies have shown that GLP-1 analogs has a beneficial effect in the&#xD;
      treatment of various degenerative neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease. GLP-1 analogs have been shown to reduce brain infarct size in mice after&#xD;
      focal brain ischemia as well as to reduce heart infarct size in swine in a model of&#xD;
      myocardial infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent clinical testing in humans have demonstrated a benefit of GLP-1 infusion on myocardial&#xD;
      infarct size and a larger salvage index in patients with myocardial infarction. The GLP-1&#xD;
      analogs were infused in acutely ill patients in many ways similar to cardiac arrest patients&#xD;
      with no increased risk of adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a double blinded randomized study seeking to evaluate the potential&#xD;
      neuroprotective effects of GLP-1 analogs infused in comatose patients after out of hospital&#xD;
      cardiac arrest.&#xD;
