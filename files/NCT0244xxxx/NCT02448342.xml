      Multi center, randomized controlled study, to determine if a significant decrease in the rate&#xD;
      of heart failure re-hospitalizations occurs during a follow-up period when - ReDS guided&#xD;
      treatment is used as an adjunct to standard of care.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as a prospective, randomized, controlled, multi-center trial. Patients&#xD;
      will be enrolled during an index hospitalization for Acutely decompensated Heart Failure&#xD;
      (ADHF) and will be followed for a minimum of 3 months or a maximum of 9 months (until the&#xD;
      last patient has completed the 3- month follow-up). Patients will be blinded to ReDS readings&#xD;
      values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment will take place either during a heart failure hospitalization (see acceptance&#xD;
      criteria below) or within 10 days after discharge from a qualifying heart failure&#xD;
      hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Remote Dielectric Sensing (ReDS) device provides noninvasive measurement of lung fluid&#xD;
      content. It comprises a wearable vest with embedded sensors and a bedside console. A&#xD;
      measurement reading is provided within 90sec. Results are shared with the treating physician&#xD;
      via a secured web portal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objective is to determine if a significant decrease in the rate of heart failure&#xD;
      re-hospitalizations occurs during the entire follow-up period when ReDS guided treatment is&#xD;
      used as an adjunct to standard of care (SOC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized between two groups before hospital discharge to: ReDS with SOC&#xD;
      vs. SOC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient that are randomized to the treatment arm will perform daily ReDS measurement at home.&#xD;
      Treating physician will follow up on patients' measurements through a secured dedicated web&#xD;
      site. Notification messages will be automatically sent by the system to the physician if&#xD;
      certain thresholds are crossed (thresholds are physician adjustable). Medications will be&#xD;
      adjusted according to defined guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients that are randomized to the control arm will be followed up and medically managed&#xD;
      according to standard of care guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both arms scheduled clinical visits and phone follow up:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A follow up phone call, per current treatment guidelines, will be attempted within 2&#xD;
           days of hospital discharge to obtain information regarding medication reconciliation,&#xD;
           Heart Failure (HF) symptoms and other HF management issues (e.g., dietary restrictions).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An outpatient clinic visit will be scheduled after a week of hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study follow-up visits at 1 and 3 months. Follow-up will be continued for enrolled&#xD;
           subjects at 6 and 9 months until the last subject has pass through the 3-month follow-up&#xD;
           window.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  At each study follow-up visit, patients will undergo complete physical exam, vital&#xD;
                signs, collection of readmission and standard blood tests and QOL questionnaire.&#xD;
