  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is about an interventional study.The use of the blotting paper called &quot;Dried Blood Spot&quot;&#xD;
      or DBS is a method of systematic neonatal screening of the metabolic diseases. Indeed, it has&#xD;
      multiple interests: realized thanks to lancets, it is much less invasive than a classic blood&#xD;
      collection. Besides, the transport of the blood sampling is facilitated because most of the&#xD;
      analysts are stable on DBS at room temperature one week or more. Finally the use of this DM&#xD;
      reduces the infectious risks bound to the manipulation of the blood sampling and to the&#xD;
      inactivation of microorganisms. The moderate results are vitamin D, albumin, prealbumin, CRP,&#xD;
      orosomucoide&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DBS presents a major interest for the care of the old and fragile people who have on one&#xD;
      hand a low peripheral venous capital and on the other hand for whom the possibility of a&#xD;
      dosage on DBS will allow a facilitated biological follow-up. Indeed it is very important to&#xD;
      detect as soon as possible the most fragile old people, those who have the biggest risk of&#xD;
      seeing their health degrading during a physical, psychic or social stress, to concentrate the&#xD;
      efforts of coverage and limit these risks. The advantage of the biological criteria is the&#xD;
      speed of the test making (a blood test), in the absence of necessity of active participation&#xD;
      by the patient (the clinical criteria require to test the patient in the walking, to test its&#xD;
      muscular strength, etc.) and in the saving of time diagnosis for the clinician. The blood&#xD;
      biological markers of the fragility are essentially the rate of 25OH vitamin D, the markers&#xD;
      of undernutrition (albumin, prealbumin) and of the inflammation (CRP, orosomucoïde). These&#xD;
      last four parameters are now measurable from the DBS thanks to the quantitative mass&#xD;
      spectrometry.&#xD;

      Main objective: Define the analytical concordance between dosages realized on blotting paper&#xD;
      (DBS) and classic dosages after blood test for the five markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives: Study the influence of the hématocrite, the hemoglobin, the total&#xD;
      proteins on the dosages on DBS, and realize a biological collection of blood sample on DBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and Feasibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recruitment of the patients will be made with the Service of Geriatrics of the CHRU of&#xD;
      Montpellier (Pr C. Jeandel, Dr G. Baptista), which have an important number of compatible&#xD;
      patients with the number of planned patients for the study. In the standard blood results&#xD;
      will be added a capillary taken which will be deposited on 3 DBS. The study of concordance of&#xD;
      biological methods will include on one hand an analytical evaluation of the new methods in&#xD;
      terms of reproducibility, repeatability, limit of detection and quantification. On the other&#xD;
      hand, a comparison of the values of the dosages on venous taking (blood test) for normal and&#xD;
      pathological values will be realized by the method of Bland and Altman associated with a&#xD;
      regression of balanced Deming.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calendar of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      M0-M6: optimization of the analytical method / M0-M3: Statutory for the clinical part (CPP..)&#xD;
      M4-M16: inclusion of the patients / M6-M20: validation of the dosages on DBS M12-M24:&#xD;
      valuation of the results (scientific articles, presentations, exploit the know-how)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives :&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be able to realize thanks to the DBS the follow-up of these biological parameters at the&#xD;
      old people is a major step forward for the patients by avoiding classic blood test and by&#xD;
      facilitating the preanalytical phase, making it more easily compatible with the telemedicine&#xD;
      in particular, with the dosages practicable at home, in retirement home, at the doctor's&#xD;
      office, with simple postal sending to analysis laboratories.&#xD;
