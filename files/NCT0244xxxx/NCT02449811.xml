      Randomized, open-label, parallel-group study conducted at a single center in Switzerland.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients diagnosed with primary arterial hypertension requiring antihypertensive drug&#xD;
      Treatment as well as patients after a 4 week wash out period (Amendment 07/2016) will be&#xD;
      recruited at the University Hospital Basel, Switzerland. Subjects will be randomized to&#xD;
      either the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-, angiotensin receptor blocker-, calcium&#xD;
      channel blocker- or hydrochlorothiazide-treatment arm. Drug treatment follows current&#xD;
      guidelines issued by the European Society of Hypertension. Treatment-naive patients will be&#xD;
      started on an intermediate dose monotherapy (treatment period 1). In all patients who do not&#xD;
      reach blood pressure targets after 4 weeks, the dose of the monotherapy drug will be doubled&#xD;
      (high dose, treatment period 2). Sampling for the analysis of RAS peptide profiles,&#xD;
      measurement of drug concentrations in plasma and non-invasive hemodynamic measurements will&#xD;
      be done. A control group with 20 age and gender matched, healthy and normotensive subjects&#xD;
      will be recruited to establish the characteristics of the RAS peptide profiles in a&#xD;
      comparable but normotensive population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single-center, randomized, open-label, parallel-group study in patients with&#xD;
      treatment-naive arterial hypertension to characterize RAS peptide profiles before and after&#xD;
      treatment initiation with different antihypertensive drug-classes. Patients diagnosed with&#xD;
      primary arterial hypertension requiring antihypertensive drug treatment as well as patients&#xD;
      after a 4 week wash out period (Amendment from 07/2016) will be recruited from the Medical&#xD;
      Outpatient Clinic at the University Hospital Basel, Switzerland. Diagnostic work-up and&#xD;
      follow-up assessments after treatment initiation such as 24 hour blood pressure measurement&#xD;
      will be performed according to clinical practice guidelines and will only be documented but&#xD;
      not altered by this study. Study mandated procedures will be randomization to one of the four&#xD;
      standard first-line treatment arms, blood sampling for RAS peptide profile and drug&#xD;
      concentration determination, and non-invasive hemodynamic measurements. After having provided&#xD;
      written informed consent, patients will be randomized to either the angiotensin-converting&#xD;
      enzyme inhibitor-, angiotensin receptor blocker-, calcium channel blocker- or&#xD;
      hydrochlorothiazide-treatment arm. Drug treatment follows current guidelines issued by the&#xD;
      European Society of Hypertension . According to clinical practice, treatment-naive patients&#xD;
      with grade I and grade II hypertension will directly be started on an intermediate dose&#xD;
      monotherapy (treatment period 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment period 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      4 weeks of intermediate dose monotherapy with the angiotensin-converting enzyme Inhibitor&#xD;
      perindopril OR the angiotensin receptor blocker olmesartan OR the calcium channel blocker&#xD;
      amlodipine OR the hydrochlorothiazide&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all patients who do not reach blood pressure targets according to the 2013 ESH guidelines&#xD;
      for the management of arterial hypertension after 4 weeks, the dose of the monotherapy drug&#xD;
      will be doubled (high dose, treatment period 2), following current guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment period 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      4 weeks of high dose monotherapy with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril&#xD;
      OR the angiotensin receptor blocker olmesartan OR the calcium channel blocker amlodipine OR&#xD;
      the hydrochlorothiazide&#xD;
&#xD;
      80 patients (20 patients per treatment arm) will be included and sampling for the analysis of&#xD;
      RAS peptide profiles will be done before treatment initiation (baseline). Sampling for the&#xD;
      analysis of RAS peptide profiles and measurement of drug concentrations in plasma will be&#xD;
      done after 4 weeks of each treatment period at 0h (before last drug intake) and 4 hours after&#xD;
      last drug intake of treatment period. Dropouts will be replaced. Non-invasive hemodynamic&#xD;
      measurements will be done at the same time points as for the determination of RAS peptide&#xD;
      profiles and drug concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A control group with 20 age- and gender-matched, healthy and normotensive subjects will be&#xD;
      recruited to establish the characteristics of RAS peptide profiles in a comparable but&#xD;
      normotensive population. After having provided written informed consent, normal blood&#xD;
      pressure will be documented by a 24h blood pressure measurement. In this normotensive control&#xD;
      group, blood sampling for the determination of RAS peptide profiles as well as hemodynamic&#xD;
      measurements will only be done on a single day, at the same time of day as for the&#xD;
      hypertensive patients. (Amendment 04/2015)&#xD;
