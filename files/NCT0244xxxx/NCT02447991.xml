      Suffering from dizzy spells and migraine headaches?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vestibular Migraine (VM), a newly recognized type of migraine that causes bouts of dizziness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and The Mayo Clinic is seeking people with VM to&#xD;
      participate in a research study. The purpose of this study is to look at the natural history&#xD;
      of VM and learn more about common symptoms. Investigators also want to learn the effects,&#xD;
      both positive and negative, of the commonly used migraine drug, rizatriptan, when it is used&#xD;
      for spells of dizziness in people with VM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may be eligible to participate if:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients are between the ages of 18 &amp; 65&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients have a history of vestibular migraine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients are able to maintain a vestibular symptom diary&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes 3 visits with compensation. All participants must complete questionnaires&#xD;
      on dizziness, headache symptoms, general health and well-being, mental health, and a&#xD;
      questionnaire on patient's satisfaction with study medication.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary Specific Aim is to conduct the first successful controlled study of a treatment&#xD;
      for Vestibular Migraine. The investigators hypothesize that rizatriptan will be superior to a&#xD;
      look alike inactive capsule for:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1a. Reducing the severity and duration of vertigo attacks in patients with Vestibular&#xD;
      Migraine,&#xD;
&#xD;
      1b. Reducing the severity of symptoms commonly associated with vertigo attacks in patients&#xD;
      with Vestibular Migraine (e.g., nausea, vomiting, motion sensitivity, gait disturbance,&#xD;
      headache, light and sound sensitivity), and&#xD;
&#xD;
      1c. Improving treatment satisfaction and health-related quality of life in patients with&#xD;
      Vestibular Migraine, and that&#xD;
&#xD;
      1d. Rizatriptan will be well tolerated by patients with Vestibular Migraine.&#xD;
