      This study uses a transformative multiphasic mixed-methods research design that incorporates&#xD;
      elements of the following designs:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sequential: a secondary data analysis was conducted, using data from ATN 039, ATN 086,&#xD;
           and ATN 106, to influence the development of the qualitative interview and quantitative&#xD;
           survey instruments for primary data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Convergent parallel: concurrent collection and analysis of both qualitative and&#xD;
           quantitative primary data that will be combined to address the study objectives.&#xD;

      The ultimate goal of this study is to assess engagement of TGMY across the HIV Continuum of&#xD;
      Care. This will be accomplished through a transformative multiphasic mixed-methods research&#xD;
      study that will engage all sites in the ATN network and collect data from both internal and&#xD;
      external sources regarding the facilitators and barriers affecting TGMY's engagement across&#xD;
      the HIV Continuum of Care. Empirical and theoretical models will be produced that will guide&#xD;
      the future development of HIV-related interventions for TGMY (to be published by the study&#xD;
      team in peer-reviewed literature). In addition, findings will be translated into more&#xD;
      immediate provider-focused recommendations and multi-media resources that provide concrete&#xD;
      guidance and tools that can be applied across socio-ecological levels to promote the full&#xD;
      inclusion of TGMY in the various stages of the HIV Continuum of Care. The production of&#xD;
      multidisciplinary provider-focused materials that will support the delivery of gender&#xD;
      affirming and appropriate HIV care to TGMY is in alignment with many contemporary views of&#xD;
      translational research and will have an immediate impact on the ability of providers at AMTU&#xD;
      sites and elsewhere to provide HIV-related care to TGMY across the full HIV Continuum of&#xD;
      Care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research design incorporates elements of both a sequential design (secondary data&#xD;
      analysis from ATN 039 and ATN 086/106 influenced the development of measures for primary data&#xD;
      collection) and a convergent parallel design (concurrent collection and analysis of both&#xD;
      qualitative and quantitative primary data that will be combined to address the specific aims.&#xD;
      This design is considered a transformative mixed-methods design due to the study's&#xD;
      theoretical and conceptual grounding in Bioecological Systems Theory (BST), Gender&#xD;
      Affirmation, and Gender Minority Stress, and the focus on advancing the needs of&#xD;
      underrepresented and marginalized populations. Mixed methods studies typically involve&#xD;
      collecting and analyzing data derived from both quantitative and qualitative data sources in&#xD;
      order to gain greater insight into a research problem than would be gained by using only one&#xD;
      of the two methods in isolation. By combining methods, the limitations and biases inherent in&#xD;
      one single methodology can be lessened by using multiple forms of data collection. The&#xD;
      qualitative phase of the study will use a phenomenological investigative approach, which will&#xD;
      help to understand the sociocultural behaviors, language, roles, and interactions within a&#xD;
      culture-sharing group (i.e., TGMY) and triangulation of the qualitative data with the&#xD;
      quantitative data strengthens the validity of the information received by using a combination&#xD;
      of data sources.&#xD;
