  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well rituximab and pembrolizumab with or without lenalidomide&#xD;
      works in treating patients with follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma that&#xD;
      has returned after a period of improvement. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as&#xD;
      rituximab and pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may&#xD;
      interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy,&#xD;
      such as lenalidomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by&#xD;
      killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving&#xD;
      rutuximab with pembrolizumab and lenalidomide may work better at treating follicular lymphoma&#xD;
      and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;

      22. Patients also receive pembrolizumab IV over 1 hour on day 2 every 3 weeks for up to 16&#xD;
      cycles (1 year) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT II: Patients receive rituximab IV over 4-8 hours on days 1, 8 and 15 of cycle 1, and&#xD;
      day 1 of cycle 2. Patients also receive pembrolizumab IV over 1 hour on day 2 every 3 weeks&#xD;
      for up to 2 years, and lenalidomide orally (PO) on days 1-14 every 3 weeks for up to 12&#xD;

      1 year, and then every 6 months thereafter.&#xD;

Toxicity will be monitored simultaneously using the Bayesian stopping boundaries calculated based on beta-binomial distributions. Toxicity defined as any grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicity that in the opinion of the principal investigator is at least possibly related to study treatment. Toxicity evaluation will be based on the incidence of severity and type of adverse events (including physical and laboratory). Frequency tables will be used to summarize categorical variables. Logistic regression will be utilized to assess the effect of patient prognostic factors on the toxicity rate.</description>
