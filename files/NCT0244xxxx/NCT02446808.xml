      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single surgeon, single institution prospective post-market study of patients&#xD;
      undergoing a robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) with intraoperative nerve&#xD;
      monitoring of pelvic nerves using the ProPep Nerve Monitoring System. The treatment group&#xD;
      will consist of 80 subjects (with 69 anticipated to be evaluable) undergoing RALP with&#xD;
      intraoperative nerve monitoring (IONM). This will be compared to a consecutive group of&#xD;
      contemporary control cohort patients who have underwent RALP without nerve monitoring by the&#xD;
      same single surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Evaluations and Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-operative baseline evaluations and data collection will be used to determine eligibility&#xD;
      for enrollment and to document subject clinical status prior to surgical procedure. This&#xD;
      information is recorded on the Screening case report forms (CRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data will be collected at screening/baseline:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical History including Gleason score at biopsy, and clinical stage (cT, TNM 2002);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic information;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Current symptoms;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite for Clinical Practice (EPIC-CP) Questionnaire;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SHIM Questionnaire;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Use of any drugs for erectile dysfunction ;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Confirmation of inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical Procedure The surgical procedure should be completed according to site-specific&#xD;
      standards. The following is a general overview of the surgical procedure for this study. The&#xD;
      daVinci Surgical System must be used. Additional instrumentation necessary to perform the&#xD;
      procedure is determined by the surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Pep Electrode Introducer facilitates the introduction of the needle electrodes into the&#xD;
      pelvis. The electrodes are initially placed in the levator muscle near the apex of the&#xD;
      prostate in the area of the nerve bundles prior to the pedicle dissection to identify the&#xD;
      perineal branches of the pudendal nerve. Prior to posterior dissection of the apex of the&#xD;
      prostate, the needle electrodes are removed from the levator muscle and moved to the external&#xD;
      urethral sphincter to identify the deep (muscular) branch of the perineal nerves. Action&#xD;
      potentials are measured by the Pep Monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Signals are induced in the nerve(s) of interest by stimulating the tissue surrounding the&#xD;
      nerve(s) along the presumed nerve pathway with a low level electrical current. The low level&#xD;
      current is delivered through the conventional bipolar instrument used during robotic surgery&#xD;
      and when delivered close to a nerve it triggers and action potential in the nerve that is&#xD;
      displayed on the Pep Monitor. The Pep Control Switch is used to switch the bipolar instrument&#xD;
      between cautery mode and stimulation mode. The closer the bipolar instrument is to the nerve&#xD;
      being located, the larger the amplitude of the action potential displayed by the Pep Monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nerves will be identified with the device prior to pedicle and apical dissection to establish&#xD;
      nerve location. Nerve monitoring may be used through the course of dissections to confirm&#xD;
      nerve location. Post-dissection readings will be collected after specimen removal to confirm&#xD;
      the integrity of the preserved nerve tissue at the end of the case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the procedure and through hospital discharge the following data points will be&#xD;
      collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type of nerve sparing - none, partial, and bilateral;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prostate size;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimated blood loss and transfusion(s);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Method of dissection (transperitoneal anterior, posterior, extraperitoneal, or lymph&#xD;
           node dissection);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gleason score at radical prostatectomy;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pathological stage (nT);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Positive surgical margin rate (PSM);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total robotic and surgical time;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total time for device deployment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospital admission / discharge dates; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative care will be according to the site-specific standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Evaluation and Data Collections:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be followed post-operatively at catheter removal (typically 1 week), 1 month&#xD;
      (±2 weeks), 3 months (±3 weeks), 6 months (±1 month), and 12 months (±1 month) following the&#xD;
      procedure. Data will be collected on the appropriate follow-up Case Report Forms (CRFs). The&#xD;
      CRFs for each of the follow-up data collection points will be supplied to the subjects upon&#xD;
      their discharge from the hospital following their procedure. Research assistant will call&#xD;
      subjects the week prior to the due date to remind subjects to fill in and mail back (via&#xD;
      pre-addressed, stamped envelopes supplied with CRFs) appropriate CRF. Site specific standard&#xD;
      of care will be followed post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data and testing will be completed at each follow-up visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Current symptoms;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Modified EPIC-CP Questionnaire (question 3 and 4);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SHIM Questionnaire;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Use of any drugs for erectile dysfunction; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse events (AE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contemporary Control Cohort:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the procedures for the prospective cohort are standard of care at the investigators&#xD;
      institution, the investigator will have all of the same measures for the contemporary control&#xD;
      cohort that he has for the for the prospective cohort. Each prospective subject will be&#xD;
      matched to two selected subjects in the contemporary control cohort by biopsy Gleason score&#xD;
      (6 vs. 7 vs. 8-10), nerve-sparing status (yes/no), type of nerve sparing (unilateral or&#xD;
      bilateral) and age (within 5 years). The contemporary control cohort will draw from&#xD;
      consecutive patients who have undergone RALP in the previous two years (2012-2014) that did&#xD;
      not have IONM. The investigator will not record AEs for this contemporary control cohort as&#xD;
      the investigator is only interested in collecting AEs data potentially related to the use of&#xD;
      the IONM.&#xD;
