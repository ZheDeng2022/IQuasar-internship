    <textblock>
      Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a hormone-dependent mental condition that causes&#xD;
      significant suffering in 5% of women of reproductive age worldwide. The prominent symptoms&#xD;
      are depressed mood, irritability, mood lability and anxiety. Treatment options for PMDD are&#xD;
      limited, with 40% non-responders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (dTMS) is a novel therapeutic technique, which is&#xD;
      based on modulating neural activity by inducing an electric field in the brain. To date, dTMS&#xD;
      was found to be an effective treatment for depression, which is highly comorbid with PMDD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to study the effect of dTMS on PMDD patients in a prospective&#xD;
      treatment study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a hormone-dependent mental condition that causes&#xD;
      significant distress in 5% of reproductive age women worldwide. The disorder was recently&#xD;
      added to the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM-5) as one of the mood&#xD;
      disorders. PMDD is characterized by affective, cognitive, behavioral, and somatic symptoms.&#xD;
      Treatment possibilities are limited, and 30-40% of patients who do not respond to&#xD;
      antidepressants or oral contraceptives, are faced with no alternative effective treatment&#xD;
      options. PMDD is highly comorbid with major depressive disorder (MDD) and neuroimaging&#xD;
      studies in both disorders demonstrate dysfunction of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex&#xD;
      (DLPFC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (dTMS) is a technique of neuromodulation based on&#xD;
      specific anatomic induction of an electric field in the brain. To date, dTMS was proved as an&#xD;
      effective treatment tool in a number of mental conditions including drug-resistant major&#xD;
      depression, in which the onset of the salutary effect of dTMS was relatively quick (compared&#xD;
      with conventional antidepressants). Most clinical trials studying the effect of dTMS in major&#xD;
      depression, focused on stimulating the DLPFC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to conduct a prospective double blind cross-over study, to study&#xD;
      the effect of short-term dTMS treatment on PMDD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to conduct the first evaluation of deep transcranial magnetic&#xD;
      stimulation (dTMS) as a treatment option for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). The&#xD;
      treatment of this recurrent episodic disorder, that effects young, reproductive-age women,&#xD;
      poses a significant clinical challenge, as current treatment options imply reproductive&#xD;
      impairment (oral contraceptives or GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone) agonists) or&#xD;
      disturbing side effects (e.g. sexual side effects in SSRI's (selective serotonin reuptake&#xD;
      inhibitor)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, as many as 40% of women with PMDD do not respond to conventional antidepressants&#xD;
      or oral contraceptives, and remain without an effective and tolerable treatment option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The symptoms of PMDD are episodic and time-limited, and indeed, some of the pharmacological&#xD;
      treatment strategies for PMDD consist of intermittent therapy. Thus, he investigators assume&#xD;
      that dTMS administered during the 7-14 symptomatic days (after ovulation), may provide a&#xD;
      highly needed, tolerable and efficient treatment option for women suffering from this&#xD;
      disorder, and may actually prevent the onset of symptoms.&#xD;
