      This is a prospective, non-randomized, single cohort, multicenter study to evaluate the&#xD;
      clinical outcomes of TKA using the JOURNEY™ II CR Total Knee System in subjects with&#xD;
      degenerative joint disease (DJD) requiring primary total knee replacement. One hundred and&#xD;
      seventy (170) subjects will be enrolled at up to 18 clinical sites globally. Follow-up&#xD;
      clinical assessments will be performed at 3 months, 1 year, 2 years, 5 years, and 10 years&#xD;
      post-operatively.&#xD;
