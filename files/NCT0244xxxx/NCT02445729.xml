    <textblock>
      Immediate wound coverage is one of the cornerstones of post-operative wound management.&#xD;
      Dressings are typically left in place for 24 to 48 hours following cesarean section to allow&#xD;
      ample time for healing and re-epithelialization. The functions of a surgical dressing for&#xD;
      wound healing by primary intention are to control postoperative bleeding, absorb exudate,&#xD;
      ease pain, and provide protection for newly-formed epithelium. The skin is an important&#xD;
      anatomical barrier against microbes; the reformation of an intact epithelial system following&#xD;
      injury is an important milestone for the prevention of infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wound healing is a dynamic process that involves the coordinated interaction of a variety of&#xD;
      cells, including cytokines, blood cells, extracellular matrix proteins, and parenchyma cells.&#xD;
      Wound healing has been artificially divided into three phases: inflammation, tissue formation&#xD;
      (proliferation), and tissue remodeling. These phases do not correspond to a precise period of&#xD;
      time following injury, and all of the phases overlap to some degree. Re-epithelialization&#xD;
      occurs during the proliferation phase and it is defined as the process of restoring an intact&#xD;
      epidermis after injury. It involves several processes, including the migration and&#xD;
      proliferation of adjacent epidermal keratinocytes into the wound, the differentiation of the&#xD;
      neo-epithelium into a stratified epidermis, and the restoration of an intact basement&#xD;
      membrane zone (BMZ) that will connect the epidermis and the underlying dermis.&#xD;
      Re-epithelialization of wounds begins within hours after injury. Within 24 hours,&#xD;
      keratinocytes are actively proliferating from the margins of the wound to cover the defect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical wounds that are closed by primary intention usually heal rapidly, and&#xD;
      re-epithelialization is thought to occur within 24 to 48 hours. Early studies into wound care&#xD;
      demonstrated that dressings influence the repair process. The postoperative wound dressing&#xD;
      acts to ensure the wound bed stays moist, decrease pain and inflammation, and improve scar&#xD;
      appearance. Additionally, occlusive dressings increase the rate of re-epithelialization&#xD;
      post-operatively compared to those wounds left open. The importance of dressings has been&#xD;
      established, but the ideal time that postoperative dressings should remain in place remains&#xD;
      elusive. Studies have shown that early removal of dressings (6 hours after wounding) markedly&#xD;
      decreases the rate of resurfacing while leaving the bandage on for greater than 48 hours&#xD;
      produced no greater benefit. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&#xD;
      recommends that the sterile dressing stays in place for 24-48 hours postoperatively on an&#xD;
      incision that has been closed by primary intention. Although the window of the benefit&#xD;
      provided by bandages has not been further refined since these earlier studies. By defining&#xD;
      the period during which dressings will promote epithelial resurfacing, our ability to use the&#xD;
      dressing optimally will be enhanced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our goal of this study is to compared the impact of dressing removal at 24 vs 48 hours on&#xD;
      wounds following low-risk cesarean deliveries. While epithelial proliferation begins within&#xD;
      hours of closure, it is not at its maximum until 48 to 72 hours following injury. The current&#xD;
      standard of care is to keep the dressing in place 24 to 48 hours postoperatively. However,&#xD;
      there is no data comparing the optimum timing between 24 and 48 hours. We will, therefore,&#xD;
      assess the benefit of leaving the dressing in place for 24 vs 48 hours postoperatively by&#xD;
      evaluating its impact on wound appearance and wound score using the ASEPSIS scoring method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ASEPSIS is a quantitative scoring method that provides a numerical score related to the&#xD;
      severity of wound infection using objective criteria based on wound appearance and the&#xD;
      clinical consequences of the infection in 5 days postoperatively. The severity of impaired&#xD;
      wound healing is indicated by the total score as follows: satisfactory healing 0 to 10;&#xD;
      disturbance of healing 11 to 20; minor wound infection 21 to 30; moderate wound infection 31&#xD;
      to 40; and severe wound infection more than 40. For practical reasons, absolute scores were&#xD;
      obtained based on a 1-day reading in our study, rather than the 5-day reading used in the&#xD;
      original ASEPSIS scoring system. Another objective of this study is to evaluate patients'&#xD;
      satisfaction according to complaints about their incision. Pain, erythema, induration,&#xD;
      separation of skin, and serous or purulent exudates will be documented.&#xD;
