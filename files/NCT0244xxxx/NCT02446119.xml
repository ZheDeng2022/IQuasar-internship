  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastroparesis is a disorder characterized by symptoms from gastric retention in the absence&#xD;
      of mechanical obstruction. Gastric emptying is a highly regulated process reflecting the&#xD;
      integration of the propulsive forces of proximal fundic tone and distal antral contractions&#xD;
      with the functional resistance provided by the pyloric sphincter. Pylorospasm has been&#xD;
      reported in some patients with gastroparesis. This study protocol will assess pyloric&#xD;
      sphincter pressure and geometry in patients with gastroparesis and control subjects without&#xD;
      symptoms of gastroparesis. The commercially available FDA approved endoscopic functional&#xD;
      luminal imaging probe (EndoFLIP) catheter will be used, which measures diameter, pressure,&#xD;
      length, and distensibility of gastrointestinal sphincter muscles along the balloon distance.&#xD;
      It is used to measure the pressure characteristics of the lower esophageal sphincter during&#xD;
      bariatric surgery for obesity, during Heller myotomy for achalasia, and during Nissen&#xD;
      fundoplication for gastroesophageal reflux disease. In this study, during upper endoscopy,&#xD;
      which is routinely performed under sedation, patients with gastroparesis and controls without&#xD;
      gastroparesis symptoms will have their pyloric sphincter assessed with EndoFLIP. After&#xD;
      passage of the endoscope into the stomach, the EndoFLIP catheter will be introduced alongside&#xD;
      the endoscope and advanced through the pyloric sphincter as visualized endoscopically. The&#xD;
      investigators will measure the pressure and contour of the pyloric sphincter using three&#xD;
      successive volume distensions of the EndoFLIP balloon (20 ml, 30 ml, 40 ml). The&#xD;
      investigators will compare the results between the gastroparesis patients and the control&#xD;
      patients without gastroparesis. Through this study, the investigators will better understand&#xD;
      the abnormalities of the pyloric sphincter in patients with gastroparesis.&#xD;

      This study protocol will assess pyloric sphincter pressure and geometry in patients with&#xD;
      gastroparesis and control subjects without symptoms of gastroparesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: To determine if there is a subgroup of patients with gastroparesis who have pressure&#xD;
      and/or geometric configuration abnormalities of the pyloric sphincter. We will determine this&#xD;
      by assessing the pressure, diameter, length, and distensibility of the pyloric sphincter in&#xD;
      patients with gastroparesis and in subjects without gastroparesis undergoing upper endoscopy&#xD;
      for their clinical evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:The pylorus of patients with gastroparesis has a higher pressure, smaller&#xD;
      diameter, and is less distensible than the pylorus of control patients without gastroparesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The commercially available FDA approved endoscopic functional luminal imaging probe&#xD;
      (EndoFLIP) catheter will be used, which measures diameter, pressure, length, and&#xD;
      distensibility of gastrointestinal sphincter muscles along the balloon distance. It is used&#xD;
      to measure the pressure characteristics of the lower esophageal sphincter during bariatric&#xD;
      surgery for obesity, during Heller myotomy for achalasia, and during Nissen fundoplication&#xD;
      for gastroesophageal reflux disease. In this study, during upper endoscopy, which is&#xD;
      routinely performed under sedation, patients with gastroparesis and controls without&#xD;
      gastroparesis symptoms will have their pyloric sphincter assessed with EndoFLIP. After&#xD;
      passage of the endoscope into the stomach, the EndoFLIP catheter will be introduced alongside&#xD;
      the endoscope and advanced through the pyloric sphincter as visualized endoscopically. The&#xD;
      investigators will measure the pressure and contour of the pyloric sphincter using three&#xD;
      successive volume distensions of the EndoFLIP balloon (20 ml, 30 ml, 40 ml). The assessment&#xD;
      of the pylorus will be done during the upper endoscopy which will take approximately 60&#xD;
      minutes. We will compare the pyloric pressure measurements in patients with gastroparesis to&#xD;
      the control patients. This is an observational study, with no intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis: The investigators will compare the results between the gastroparesis patients and&#xD;
      the control patients without gastroparesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through this study, the investigators will better understand the abnormalities of the pyloric&#xD;
      sphincter in patients with gastroparesis.&#xD;
