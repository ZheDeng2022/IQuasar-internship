      The purpose of the present study is to gather pilot data on the effects of linagliptin on the&#xD;
      concentration of the long and short forms of SDF1-α (stromal cell-derived factor alpha) in&#xD;
      humans, and to demonstrate the feasibility of such a study in patients with psychosis in our&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;

      This study is a 13-week, open-label study of 8 participants with schizophrenia and minimal&#xD;
      thought disorder; they will have 12 weeks of treatment and week for assessment. They will&#xD;
      receive linagliptin, 5 mg by mouth once per day, while continuing their antipsychotic&#xD;
      treatment. The principal outcome measures will be the concentrations of the long and short&#xD;
      forms of SDF1-α (stromal cell-derived factor alpha) in blood.&#xD;
