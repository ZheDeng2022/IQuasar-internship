    <textblock>
      Phase II, single-arm study of AZD6094 (Volitinib) in combination with docetaxel, in advanced&#xD;
      gastric adenocarcinoma patients with MET overexpression as a second-line treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volitinib is an orally available, potent, selective, small molecule c-MET inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive Volitinib once daily (at the MTD determined from Phase Ib) for 21 days&#xD;
      as one cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Docetaxel 60 mg/m2 will be administered via intravenous access once every 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the efficacy of volitinib when given in combination with docetaxel in patients&#xD;
      with advanced gastric adenocarcinoma harboring MET overexpression.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a xenograft model Hs746T with c-Met gene amplification, suboptimal doses 0.6 mg/kg&#xD;
      volitinib and 3 mg/kg docetaxel induced TGI of 55.8% and 80.8%, respectively, whereas&#xD;
      combination resulted in a TGI by 101.1%, and statistical significance was seen between&#xD;
      combination group and either of mono-therapy group. Plasma exposures of volitinib and&#xD;
      docetaxel were determined after last dose at the end of study, and there was no significant&#xD;
      difference between combination and single agent on exposures of either volitinib or&#xD;
      docetaxel. More importantly, combination was well tolerant and no body weight loss was found&#xD;
      in the animals. These results suggested that it would be worthwhile to study the combination&#xD;
      use of volitinib and docetaxel in clinic.&#xD;
