      This phase Ib combination study is being conducted to assess the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      radium Ra 223 dichloride in combination with paclitaxel in cancer subjects with bone lesions&#xD;
      with special focus on Grade 3/4 incidence of neutro- and/or thrombocytopenia and exploration&#xD;
      of the mode of interaction (i.e. additive or synergistic interaction) between the selected&#xD;
      chemotherapy and radium Ra 223 dichloride with regard to myelosuppression.&#xD;

             tumors and at least two according bone lesions. A standard of practice bone scan for&#xD;
             the documentation of at least 2 bone lesions can be used as long as it is within 3&#xD;
             months of planned start of treatment. If no bone scan within a 3 month window is&#xD;
             available, then technetium 99m or NaF PET bone scan will be obtained at screening&#xD;
             (within 28 days of planned start of study drug)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eligible to treatment with paclitaxel as single agent, following the assessment of the&#xD;
             investigator. If treatment with paclitaxel has already been initiated before signing&#xD;
             the informed consent, patients will not be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For women: documentation of menopausal status: pre menopausal or post menopausal&#xD;
             subjects. Post menopausal status is defined either by: one year or more of amenorrhea&#xD;

             bilateral oophorectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women and men of reproductive potential must agree to use adequate contraception when&#xD;
             sexually active. This applies for the time period between signing of the informed&#xD;
             consent form and for 6 months after the last radium Ra 223 dichloride administration.&#xD;
             These procedures should be documented in source documents, the investigator or a&#xD;
             designated associate is requested to advise the subject on how to achieve birth&#xD;
             control.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a serum pregnancy test performed within 7&#xD;
             days before start of study treatment, and a negative result must be documented before&#xD;
             start of study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of at least 16 weeks&#xD;

                  treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate liver function assessed within 7 days of starting the study treatment, judged&#xD;
             by the following laboratory values:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x the upper limit of normal range (ULN) (except for&#xD;
                  subjects with documented Gilbert's disease) AND&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 2.5 x ULN&#xD;
                  (≤5 x ULN for subjects whose cancer involves their liver including liver&#xD;
                  metastasis) within 7 days of starting the study treatment AND&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Albumin &gt; 30 g/L within 7 days of starting the study treatment&#xD;

          -  International normalized ratio (INR) ≤ 1.5 and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) or&#xD;
             activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) ≤ 1.5 x ULN unless receiving treatment&#xD;
             with therapeutic anticoagulation. Patients being treated with anticoagulant, e.g.&#xD;
             heparin, will be allowed to participate provided no prior evidence of an underlying&#xD;
             abnormality in these parameters exists and INR of the patient is &lt; 3. Close monitoring&#xD;
             of at least weekly evaluations will be performed until INR and PTT are stable based on&#xD;
             a pre-dose measurement as defined by the local standard of care If patients are on&#xD;
             newer generation therapeutic blood thinning agents without the requirement of&#xD;
             monitoring (e.g. Xarelto, Dabigatran), patients are eligible and management (e.g.&#xD;
             discontinuation of the anticoagulant) will be handled by good medical practice&#xD;
