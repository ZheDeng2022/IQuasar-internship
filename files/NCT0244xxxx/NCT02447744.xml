    <textblock>
      Childhood trauma is remarkably prevalent, and it has long lasting impact on mental health and&#xD;
      neural development. This trial aims to see whether the 8-week mindfulness based intervention&#xD;
      can reduce stress related psychological symptoms for young adults with childhood&#xD;
      maltreatment, and whether it can promote neural plasticity.&#xD;

      This study recruits young adults with childhood adversity; enrolled subjects either receive&#xD;
      an 8-week mindfulness based intervention, or wait for 8 weeks before receiving the&#xD;
      intervention. MRI and a battery of self report questionnaires will be administered before and&#xD;
      after the intervention; subjects on the waiting list will undergo the same research&#xD;
      procedures at the same time as subjects in the intervention group. Primary hypotheses include&#xD;
      improved hippocampal plasticity, increased mindfulness and reduced stress and related&#xD;
      psychological symptoms.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Subjects' Perceived Stress Level</measure>
    <time_frame>After the 8-week intervention program compared to baseline measurement, or the same time as the intervention group for subjects on the waiting list.</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in the Perceived Stress Scale scores (post- intervention scores minus pre- intervention scores). Relevant time points used in the calculation include baseline scores at enrollment, and post-intervention/waiting period scores after 2 months of intervention or waiting period. Calculations of the change entail post-intervention/waiting period scores minus baseline scores for each individual subject.&#xD;
The Perceived Stress Scale is a 10 item scale (each responded with Likert scale 0-4), the scale score is the sum of all items, thus the full range of PSS scores is 0-40, with higher scores means worse stress. A reduction in PSS scores (i.e., the change scores being negative) indicates subjects have improved after the intervention by becoming less stressed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes of Mindfulness</measure>
    <time_frame>After the 8-week intervention program compared to baseline measurement, or the same time as the intervention group for subjects on the waiting list.</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in the mindfulness level as measured by the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (post-intervention scores minus pre-intervention scores).&#xD;
Relevant time points used in the calculation include baseline scores at enrollment, and post-intervention/waiting period scores after 2 months of intervention or waiting period. Calculations of the change entail post-intervention/waiting period scores minus baseline scores for each individual subject.&#xD;
The MAAS is a 15-item scale each responded with Likert scale 1-6; the MAAS score calculated as the mean of all items, thus the full range of the score is 1-6, with higher scores meaning more mindful. An increase in MAAS score (i.e., a positive score change )means the subject has improved after the intervention by becoming more mindful.</description>

Relevant time points used in the calculation include baseline scores at enrollment, and post-intervention/waiting period scores after 2 months of intervention or waiting period. Calculations of the change entail post-intervention/waiting period scores minus baseline scores for each individual subject.&#xD;
The Perceived Stress Scale is a 10 item scale (each responded with Likert scale 0-4), the scale score is the sum of all items, thus the full range of PSS scores is 0-40, with higher scores means worse stress. A reduction in PSS scores (i.e., the change scores being negative) indicates subjects have improved after the intervention by becoming less stressed.</description>
