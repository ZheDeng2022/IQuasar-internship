  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This non-interventional study will include a representative sample of patients with locally&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic NSCLC harboring Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)-mutations in&#xD;
      Greece. Eligible NSCLC patients, for whom the physician has decided to initiate treatment&#xD;
      with the study medication (afatinib, GIOTRIF®) will be treated according to the local&#xD;
      prescribing information and standard medical practice in terms of visit frequency and types&#xD;
      of assessments performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will investigate the impact of GIOTRIF (Afatinib) on patients' disease-related&#xD;
      symptom burden and Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) in a real world clinical setting in&#xD;
      Greece.The Average Symptom Burden Index (ASBI) score of the Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS)&#xD;
      in eligible patients, after 6 months of therapy, will be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall study duration period is expected to be 60 months, including a 48-month&#xD;
      enrollment period and a minimum 12-month follow-up period.&#xD;

        Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adult outpatients (18 years and older) of either gender;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic (IIIB/IV)&#xD;
             NSCLC of any histological type with activating EGFR mutation(s) according to local&#xD;
             laboratory EGFR testing;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  EGFR- tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) naive patients;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients for whom the decision to prescribe therapy with afatinib (GIOTRIF®) according&#xD;
             to the locally approved product's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) has&#xD;
             already been taken prior to their enrolment in the study; the assignment of the&#xD;
             patient to this therapeutic strategy is not decided in advance by the study protocol&#xD;
             but falls within current practice and the prescription of afatinib is clearly&#xD;
             separated from the physicians decision to include the patient in the current study;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be able and willing to provide written informed consent and to comply&#xD;
             with the requirements of this study protocol;&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have initiated treatment with Afatinib more than 7 days prior to their&#xD;
             enrolment into the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients that meet any of the contraindications to the administration of the study&#xD;
             drug according to the approved SmPC;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of any investigational agent within 30 days or 5 half-lives of the&#xD;
             investigational agent (whichever is longer) before the commencement of therapy with&#xD;
             afatinib&#xD;
