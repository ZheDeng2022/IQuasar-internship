  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, multi-center, single-arm, open-label, Phase II clinical study to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness, device placement, safety, and tolerability of VeraCept to support commencing a&#xD;
      Phase III Clinical Study&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 250 subjects will be consented, screened and have VeraCept placed, with a goal to have&#xD;
      2240 evaluable cycles at 12 months. It is planned that 225 of the 250 subjects will be within&#xD;
      the 18-35 year age range, with a total of 2015 evaluable cycles. The remaining 25 subjects&#xD;
      will be within the 35-40 year age range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up: Physical assessment (office visit) will occur at weeks 6, 13, 26 and 52 after&#xD;
      placement, with monthly telephone contact. For those subjects who wish to continue study&#xD;
      device use after 12 months, follow-up office visits will occur every 6 months. Additional&#xD;
      visits will be conducted if necessary for safety issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up after early study device removal:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects requesting VeraCept removal to become pregnant will be followed to pregnancy or&#xD;
      until the subject changes their mind about trying to get pregnant. All subjects in whom&#xD;
      VeraCept is removed prior to 12 months, for any reason, will be required to use an&#xD;
      alternative contraceptive for the first two weeks following removal. Progestin-only pills&#xD;
      will be provided by the sponsor as a contraceptive option during this time unless the subject&#xD;
      has a category 4 condition precluding their use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Pre-menopausal women ages 18 - 40, at risk for pregnancy, who are&#xD;
      interested in using an intrauterine contraceptive for birth control will be eligible for this&#xD;
      study. Subjects must provide written informed consent and meet the study subject selection&#xD;
      criteria without any exclusions as outlined in the Clinical Investigation Plan (CIP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Effectiveness Outcome: The primary outcome measure is effectiveness, evaluated as the&#xD;
      absence of pregnancy by 12 months, failure will be calculated by the Pearl Index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and Other Outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures: Safety and other outcome measures include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Device Placement:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ease of placement&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placement success&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serious Adverse Events&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse Events&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tolerability:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bleeding and spotting patterns&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Discontinuation rate and reasons for discontinuation&#xD;
