      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an important public health problem with an estimated 1.7&#xD;
      million new cases in the United States each year. Although the vast majority of these victims&#xD;
      sustain mild TBI, many still develop headache, difficulty concentrating, and decreased memory&#xD;
      with potential for serious long-term consequences. In particular, mild TBI is an important&#xD;
      consequence of combat-related injuries sustained by military personnel and sports-related&#xD;
      injuries in young adults. Unfortunately, treatment of mild TBI is usually limited to oral&#xD;
      analgesics for headache pain such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Motrin or Advil).&#xD;
      Since there are no previous randomized trials of these medications for mild TBI, their&#xD;
      comparative effectiveness is not known. Increasing animal based evidence suggests that mild&#xD;
      TBI is related to brain cell injury caused by overexpression of a cellular enzyme (COX-2)&#xD;
      that causes neuroinflammation. Fortunately, inhibition of COX-2 is easily achieved using&#xD;
      ibuprofen. We hypothesize that head injured patients treated with ibuprofen will have a lower&#xD;
      incidence of mild TBI symptoms than patients treated with acetaminophen. We will conduct a&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial to measure the comparative effects of ibuprofen versus&#xD;
      acetaminophen on the incidence of specific symptoms of mild TBI in emergency department&#xD;
      patients with head injury.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term goal of the proposed project is to develop an effective pharmacological therapy&#xD;
      for patients with mild TBI to improve functional outcomes. The main objective is to compare&#xD;
      the effects of ibuprofen versus acetaminophen for reducing the short-term development&#xD;
      post-concussion symptoms in patients with mild TBI. We will conduct a double-blinded&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial (RCT) with the specific aim of measuring the comparative effects of&#xD;
      equipotent doses of ibuprofen versus acetaminophen on the incidence of concussion symptoms to&#xD;
      be measured 7 to 10 days after mild TBI in emergency department patients with isolated closed&#xD;
      head injury. The main study hypothesis of our research project is that patients with mild TBI&#xD;
      who are treated with ibuprofen will have a lower incidence of post-concussion symptoms&#xD;
      compared to patients treated with acetaminophen. The proposed investigation is novel because&#xD;
      it will be the very first RCT to compare analgesic medications for the specific treatment of&#xD;
      mild TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pathophysiology of Mild TBI. TBI results from external mechanical force applied to the&#xD;
      cranium leading to parenchymal brain damage. This resultant brain injury can range from mild&#xD;
      temporary impairment to severe disability. TBI transpires in two phases: (1) primary brain&#xD;
      injury occurs at the moment of the application of mechanical force on the cranium and results&#xD;
      in lacerations, contusions, hematomas and shearing injuries of the brain; and (2) secondary&#xD;
      brain injury begins immediately after the primary brain injury and results from the cellular&#xD;
      mediation of neuroinflammation.15,16 The principal injury of mild TBI is diffuse axonal&#xD;
      injury from shearing forces that is not usually identified by CT brain scan.17-20 Secondary&#xD;
      brain injury activates multiple cellular pathways that are initially adaptive, but become&#xD;
      pathological with overexpression and persistence.21-23 The biochemical consequences of these&#xD;
      responses develop over a period of hours with the accumulation of arachidonic acid from&#xD;
      cellular membrane stores and the induction of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) gene expression and&#xD;
      enzyme activity.15,16 Arachidonic acid is then converted to detrimental vasoactive&#xD;
      prostanglandins and free radicals by COX-2 enzyme leading to neuronal cell death (Figure 1&#xD;
      see appendix). Neural COX-2 enzyme activity remains elevated for 1 to 3 days.24 Severity of&#xD;
      neuronal injury is correlated to COX-2 overexpression which results in a &quot;vicious cycle&quot; of&#xD;
      neuroinflammation when secondary injury propagates further COX-2 activity.15,16&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Effect of COX-2 Inhibition. If COX-2 overexpression causes neuronal cell damage&#xD;
      after brain injury, then COX-2 inhibition may provide neuroprotective effects through two&#xD;
      important mechanisms: (1) by reducing detrimental vasoactive prostanglandins and free radical&#xD;
      synthesis; and (2) shunting of arachidonic acid down alternate pathways that produce&#xD;
      beneficial eicosanoids.15 These cellular mechanisms are based on findings from several animal&#xD;
      studies over the past 30 years that strongly suggest potential beneficial effects of NSAID&#xD;
      inhibition of the COX-2 enzyme as a treatment for TBI-activated neuroinflammation.25-35&#xD;
      Although these studies examined different NSAID COX-2 kinhibitors and utilized different&#xD;
      animal models of TBI, they found an overall consensus of beneficial effects (i.e., reduced&#xD;
      prostaglandin synthesis, reduced brain edema, improvement in cognitive and motor function,&#xD;
      improvements in memory, and reduced mortality) suggesting COX-2 inhibition may have effects&#xD;
      beyond analgesia in patients with mild TBI. In fact, COX-2 inhibition has been shown to be&#xD;
      beneficial for animal models for other types of brain insults including ischemic brain&#xD;
      injury.36-40&#xD;
&#xD;
      If we identify a beneficial effect of ibuprofen for patients with mild TBI that is confirmed&#xD;
      with validation studies, then new standards and guidelines will be developed to improve the&#xD;
      ED management of this common form of brain injury. Future studies will be conducted to&#xD;
      elaborate the effects of ibuprofen and other NSAIDS on both the short-term and long-term&#xD;
      complications of mild TBI and possible other forms of TBI. Discovery of a beneficial effect&#xD;
      of NSAIDs for mild TBI could be especially useful for combat-related and sports-related brain&#xD;
      injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects will be identified and enrolled in the emergency department. They will be&#xD;
      followed for a 7 to 14 day period only. The proposed project will be completed over a&#xD;
      one-year period with tasks and milestones as follows: Month 1 - develop protocol, create data&#xD;
      collection instrument and codebook, test and modify instrument, create electronic database,&#xD;
      and train assistants; Months 2 and 10 - identify and enroll eligible study subjects in the ED&#xD;
      setting, create database, enter and edit data; and Months 11 and 12 - analyze data and&#xD;
      interpret findings, prepare and submit papers to journals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design and Participants. We will conduct a double-blinded RCT to compare the effects of&#xD;
      ibuprofen versus acetaminophen on the incidence of post-concussion symptoms measured 7 to 14&#xD;
      days after mild TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Variable. The treatment variable will be equipotent oral doses of either ibuprofen&#xD;
      (800 mg TID) or acetaminophen (1000 mg TID). Ibuprofen is a nonselective NSAID that inhibits&#xD;
      both COX-1 and COX-2 isoenzymes. COX-2 inhibition prevents arachidonic acid from converting&#xD;
      to vasoactive prostaglandins and reactive oxygen species in brain cell. The analgesic,&#xD;
      antipyretic, and antiinflammatory activity of ibuprofen operates mainly through inhibition of&#xD;
      COX-2.55,56 Acetaminophen is a poor inhibitor of both COX isoenzymes in the CNS and has&#xD;
      significantly weaker antiinflammatory effects than NSAIDs. Acetaminophen does not inhibit COX&#xD;
      in peripheral tissues and is less effective in the presence of peroxides.57,58 Both ibuprofen&#xD;
      and acetaminophen are frequently prescribed for headache pain related to mild TBI in the ED&#xD;
      and other primary care settings and have excellent safety profiles for short-term use. In&#xD;
      fact, both ibuprofen and acetaminophen have been used for the antipyretic treatment of&#xD;
      children with severe traumatic brain injury.59 Subjects will receive the first medication&#xD;
      dose in the ED and will be given the remaining 5 doses to take over 48 hours as outpatients.&#xD;
      This time period was selected based on animal models identifying maximum COX-2 activity. Both&#xD;
      medications will be identically prepared to prevent subjects from identifying the type of&#xD;
      treatment regimen. Treatment assignment will be randomized by the NMH research pharmacy and&#xD;
      blinded to both the patients and the investigators. Standard methods for blinding will be&#xD;
      implemented by using tablets that are identical in size, shape, color and taste for both&#xD;
      ibuprofen and acetaminophen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection and Variable Measurement. Information concerning the outcome and secondary&#xD;
      study variables will be obtained by research assistants using standardized data collection&#xD;
      instruments. Follow up outcome assessment will be conducted through telephone interviews at 7&#xD;
      to 14 days after head injury. We will implement best practice methods for accurate and&#xD;
      complete data collection, including the following: (1) training assistants in data collection&#xD;
      methods; (2) blinding assistants to the subjects' treatment assignment; and (3) conducting&#xD;
      meetings with assistants to review data collection processes and difficulties. Subjects with&#xD;
      persistent mild TBI symptoms at time of follow up will be referred to the Rehabilitation&#xD;
      Institute of Chicago Concussion Clinic for further treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Location. Northwestern Memorial Hospital is a state-of-the art, two million square&#xD;
      foot, 873-bed tertiary teaching hospital in downtown Chicago that is the primary teaching&#xD;
      hospital affiliated with the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. The&#xD;
      Northwestern Memorial Hospital Emergency Department is an urban, academic, 56 bed, Level I&#xD;
      trauma center with an annual patient volume of over 85,000 patients per year or approximately&#xD;
      230 patients per day. The Emergency Department is staffed exclusively by board-certified&#xD;
      emergency medicine physicians that also supervise the care of 48 residents and four fellows.&#xD;
      The reported demographic distribution of the overall Emergency Department patient population&#xD;
      is as follows: 7% Hispanic; 2% Asian; 35% Black; and 63% White.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SATATISTICAL ANALYSES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analyses Plan. We will conduct all statistical analyses based on the American&#xD;
      Statistical Association Ethical Guidelines for Statistical Practice67,68 and include the&#xD;
      following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Univariate Analyses. We will first conduct univariate analyses to assess potential&#xD;
           demographic and clinical differences between the two treatment groups. We will also use&#xD;
           ANOVA to compare the effects of ibuprofen versus acetaminophen treatment on the&#xD;
           incidence of mild TBI symptoms using continuous measures of pain scores and Neural-QOL&#xD;
           measures of pain and cognitive function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Multivariate Analyses. We will use log binomial regression modeling to adjust for&#xD;
           potential residual confounding to estimate the effects of ibuprofen versus acetaminophen&#xD;
           on the incidence of mild TBI symptoms. We will also conduct survival analyses using&#xD;
           Kaplan-Meier graphs and Cox proportional hazards regression modeling to estimate&#xD;
           adjusted hazards ratios for the effects of ibuprofen versus acetaminophen on the main&#xD;
           outcomes of mild TBI symptoms. We will also conduct likelihood ratio and goodness-of-fit&#xD;
           tests to identify and include specific covariates for the regression models and&#xD;
           diagnostic methods to evaluate overall model fit and plausibility of model assumptions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Advanced Methods for Causal Inference. We will use advanced statistical methods to allow&#xD;
           assessment of causation: (1) instrumental variables to estimate the effects of ibuprofen&#xD;
           versus acetaminophen with potential treatment regimen noncompliance by using treatment&#xD;
           randomization as a perfect instrument;69,70 (2) marginal structural modeling to account&#xD;
           for time-varying confounders and to assess for direct versus indirect effects in the&#xD;
           presence of intermediate factors.71-74&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Estimation. Sample size estimation is especially challenging because there are no&#xD;
      prior human studies measuring the effect of COX-2 inhibition on the incidence of mild TBI&#xD;
      symptoms. Notwithstanding this limitation, we will use the presence of headache pain at 7 to&#xD;
      14 days as a binary outcome. Sample size estimation is based on the following: (1) 40%&#xD;
      expected frequency of headache pain in the ibuprofen group versus 60% expected frequency in&#xD;
      the acetaminophen group; (2) the use of two-sided tests performed at a significance level of&#xD;
      0.05; (3) a power of 0.80 to detect a true difference in headache pain between subjects&#xD;
      receiving ibuprofen versus acetaminophen; and (4) one to one distribution of study subjects&#xD;
      receiving ibuprofen versus acetaminophen. With these assumptions, the estimated number of&#xD;
      study subjects needed to statistically assess ibuprofen versus acetaminophen for the&#xD;
      treatment of mild TBI is a total of 214 subjects.60 Our plan to enroll over 400 subjects will&#xD;
      provide an adequate sample size to conduct our statistical analyses. The Northwestern&#xD;
      Memorial Hospital Emergency Department provides care to about 2,000 head injured patients&#xD;
      with mild TBI each year.&#xD;

    <description>The main outcome variables will be the incidence of post-concussion symptoms that will be measured using NIH Common Data Elements and Neuro-QOL instruments. The Neuro-QOL instruments were developed for the NIH by the Northwestern University Department of Medical Social Sciences to provide clinically relevant and psychometrically robust health-related quality of life assessment tools for patients with common neurological disorders. In addition, the Neuro-QOL measurement system provides item banks and short forms that enable patient reported outcome measurement in neurological research which minimizes patient burden.41-44 This information will be collected at 7 to 14 days after initial ED evaluation. Emphasis will be placed on the Neuro-QOL instruments that measure headache pain and cognitive function as these are the most common and concerning symptoms of mild TBI.</description>
