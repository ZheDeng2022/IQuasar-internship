  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Renal osteodystrophy (ROD) represents the bone histologic abnormalities resulting from loss&#xD;
      of renal function. It starts early during the loss of kidney function and is seen in&#xD;
      virtually all chronic end stage kidney disease patients on dialysis (CKD-5D). A major&#xD;
      component of ROD is bone loss leading to chronic kidney disease (CKD) associated&#xD;
      osteoporosis. Debilitating hip fractures occur in patients with CKD at a rate 4.4 times&#xD;
      higher than in the general population, with associated high costs, morbidity and an annual&#xD;
      mortality of 64%. CKD osteoporosis is distinctly different from post-menopausal osteoporosis.&#xD;
      Presently, no uniformly accepted CKD osteoporosis treatment protocol exists because of&#xD;
      challenges related to racially specific bone turnover states. Therefore, most physicians are&#xD;
      reluctant to treat this disorder despite the profound impact on health and quality of life,&#xD;
      and its association with vascular calcifications. These vascular calcifications confer an&#xD;
      increased risk for cardiovascular events which are the major cause of the over 20% annual&#xD;
      mortality rate in CKD-5D patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the proposed controlled randomized study is to test the concept that CKD&#xD;
      osteoporosis can be successfully treated when treatment is individualized by patients'&#xD;
      turnover status. The study will demonstrate that reversal of bone loss can be achieved by&#xD;
      increasing bone formation in low turnover patients, and by reducing bone resorption in normal&#xD;
      or high turnover patients. A second aim of this study is to provide new information whether&#xD;
      these treatments will also retard progression of vascular calcifications. Blood tests&#xD;
      measuring FGF23, indicators of Wnt pathway activity, bone resorption and formation will be&#xD;
      followed to understand potential mechanisms and to evaluate their usefulness for prediction&#xD;
      of changes in bone mass and vascular calcifications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CKD-5D patients with established osteoporosis will be enrolled into one of two treatment arms&#xD;
      based on bone turnover status. Each arm will be adaptively randomized by race, age and gender&#xD;
      into treatment or control groups. In the low turnover arm, teriparatide combined with&#xD;
      cinacalcet will be given, and in the normal or high turnover arm, alendronate will be&#xD;
      administered. Bone mineral density will be measured at baseline and after one year of&#xD;
      treatment by quantitative computed tomography. Calcifications of the coronaries, aorta and&#xD;
      heart valves will also be measured at the same times by multi-detector computed tomography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If this proof-of-concept study is successful, it will offer a heretofore unavailable&#xD;
      treatment for osteoporosis in CKD-5D patients thus changing the prevailing clinical practice&#xD;
      paradigm. This will provide immediate benefit to CKD patients by reducing fracture risk, bone&#xD;
      pain, and cardiovascular risk, while greatly improving their quality of life. These&#xD;
      improvements will also convey major socioeconomic benefits by decreasing the high associated&#xD;
      treatment costs. The proposed study is highly relevant to the National Institute of Diabetes&#xD;
      and Digestive and Kidney Diseases' mission of disseminating science-based information to&#xD;
      improve the health and quality of life for patients with endocrine, metabolic and kidney&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;
