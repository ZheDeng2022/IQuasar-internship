      This is a proof of concept, investigator blinded study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      a novel combination of a home narrow band ultraviolet B (NBUVB) lamp with an occlusive&#xD;
      dressing in adult subjects with mild to moderate psoriasis vulgaris. Four interpatient arms&#xD;
      will be used to compare the efficacy of combination of NBUVB with an occlusive dressing to&#xD;
      the light alone and to dressing alone and no treatment. Ten patients will be enrolled in this&#xD;
      6 weeks study.&#xD;
