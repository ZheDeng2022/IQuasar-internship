  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Advanced renal cell carcinoma is invariably fatal, with a life expectancy of 2-3 years since&#xD;
      diagnosis. Sunitinib is the standard first-line treatment for this condition, but it is&#xD;
      associated to multiple side effects, with fatigue being reported in 51-63% of patients. As&#xD;
      sunitinib-induced fatigue is likely to be mediated by inhibition of AMPk function, the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that isoquercetin, which is hydrolyzed in vivo to quercetin, a&#xD;
      known AMPk activator, is able to reduce fatigue in kidney cancer patients taking sunitinib.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Sunitinib is an oral receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that inhibits vascular&#xD;
      endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs), platelet derived growth factor receptor&#xD;
      (PDGFRs) and c-kit. Sunitinib was the first TKI to be approved for the first-line treatment&#xD;
      of advanced kidney cancer on the grounds of the results achieved in the phase III trial of&#xD;
      sunitinib vs. interferon by Motzer et al. in 2007. In this trial, the improvement in quality&#xD;
      of life was modest if compared to the advantage in PFS and response rate, which can be&#xD;
      related to the multiple adverse events of sunitinib. Sunitinib-induced toxicity includes&#xD;
      fatigue, hypertension, bone marrow toxicity, skin toxicity, and gastrointestinal toxicity.&#xD;
      Prevalence of fatigue has been reported to be 92% during administration of chemotherapy&#xD;
      agents, while in the case of kidney cancer patients treated with sunitinib, fatigue of any&#xD;
      grade has been reported in up to 51-63% of patients, with approximately 7% of them showing&#xD;
      grade 3-4 fatigue. According to the definition of NCCN guidelines, cancer-related fatigue is&#xD;
      a distressing, persistent, subjective sense of physical, emotional, and/or cognitive&#xD;
      tiredness or exhaustion related to cancer or cancer treatment that is not proportional to&#xD;
      recent activity and interferes with usual functioning. There are a number of general&#xD;
      suggestions and behavioral recommendations (e.g. moderate physical activity) that can be&#xD;
      easily and effectively implemented in the standard care for treatment and prevention of&#xD;
      fatigue in cancer patients. Awareness of these recommendations is still insufficient among&#xD;
      physicians. The use of alternative strategies, which include cognitive-behavioral therapies&#xD;
      and pharmacological agents may be effective, but present a number of barriers (access to&#xD;
      health care workers with appropriate expertise, reimbursement policy, patient's attitude,&#xD;
      drug adverse events) that limit their impact in routine clinical practice. The molecular&#xD;
      mechanisms of sunitinib-related fatigue are related to off target inhibition of multiple&#xD;
      kinases involved in cellular metabolism. In particular, sunitinib inhibits the AMPK enzyme&#xD;
      with an IC50 which is in the nanomolar range, thus interfering with catabolic,&#xD;
      energy-producing processes, such as glycolysis and lipid oxidation at a systemic level.&#xD;
      Furthermore, sunitinib also inhibits GLUT 4-mediated intracellular transport of glucose. For&#xD;
      these reasons, sunitinib is likely to cause fatigue via mechanisms which are different with&#xD;
      respect to those associated to the underlying cancer and conventional chemotherapy agents. Of&#xD;
      note, no randomized, interventional trial has ever been conducted to tackle fatigue in kidney&#xD;
      cancer patients treated with sunitinib. The current management of fatigue in these patients&#xD;
      remains unsatisfactory at the present time. Quercetin is a naturally occurring flavonol&#xD;
      characterized by a phenyl benzo(y)pyrone-derived structure, which belongs to the broader&#xD;
      group of polyphenolic flavonoid substances. While quercetin is an aglycone, naturally&#xD;
      occurring quercetin compounds are primarily glycosides, with only very small quantity&#xD;
      occurring as an aglycone. In particular, isoquercetin is the 3-O- of quercetin. Isoquercetin&#xD;
      is hydrolyzed in vivo to form quercetin, which is the reason why the biological effects of&#xD;
      quercetin and isoquercetin are pharmacodynamically identical, although isoquercetin is&#xD;
      comparatively much more bioavailable than quercetin. Quercetin and isoquercetin are&#xD;
      FDA-registered nutritional dietary ingredients suitable for consumption by the general&#xD;
      population up to 2 g and 600 mg a day, respectively. For the research purposes of this study,&#xD;
      it is noteworthy that quercetin stimulates AMPK in vitro, and it increases GLUT 4&#xD;
      translocation to the cytoplasmic membrane at micromolar concentrations comparable to those&#xD;
      possibly achievable with oral administration. These biological effects could positively&#xD;
      impact sunitinib-induced fatigue. Quercetin was able to reduce chemotherapy-induced fatigue&#xD;
      in mice, while in healthy humans, a randomized, placebo-controlled study showed that&#xD;
      supplementation of 500 mg of quercetin twice daily for 7 days provided a statistically&#xD;
      significant 13.2% increase in bike-ride time to fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, the following bullet points summarize the background and rationale of this&#xD;
      study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. sunitinib is the main and most widely used first-line treatment for metastatic kidney&#xD;
           cancer and causes fatigue in approximately 50-60% of cases;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. sunitinib-induced fatigue is likely to be mediated by GLUT-4 and AMPK downregulation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. fatigue has a negative impact on quality of life, it increases treatment-related&#xD;
           morbidity, it is responsible for treatment delay and interruption, dose reduction and&#xD;
           may ultimately reduce sunitinib efficacy;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Quercetin is a natural flavonol normally present in food and has been FDA-registered as&#xD;
           a nutritional dietary ingredient for the general population up to 1 g per day.&#xD;
           Isoquercetin is a quercetin derivative hydrolyzed in vivo to quercetin, and has been&#xD;
           considered safe for the general population as a nutritional supplement at a dose of up&#xD;
           to 600 mg a day by the FDA. The Institutional Review Board at the Dana-Farber&#xD;
           Institution and the FDA have recently approved experimentation of two dose levels of&#xD;
           isoquercetin, 500 mg and 1000 mg, to be simultaneously tested in the phase IIb part of a&#xD;
           large phase II/III trial for thrombosis prevention in cancer patients&#xD;
           (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02195232);&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. no significant negative pharmacokinetic /pharmacodynamic interaction during the&#xD;
           treatment is expected, as in vivo studies did not show any relevant pharmacokinetic&#xD;
           interaction of quercetin with CYP-metabolized drugs;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The doses employed in this study are well below the maximum tolerated dose found in a&#xD;
           phase I study testing intravenous quercetin (MTD: 1400 mg/m2). In this study, renal&#xD;
           toxicity was the main dose limiting toxicity;&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. isoquercetin may reduce fatigue in kidney cancer patients receiving sunitinib on the&#xD;
           basis of a molecular rationale, pre-clinical experimental models and clinical data.&#xD;
