  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background. During the clinical course of patients with locoregionally advanced&#xD;
      non-small-cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC) who have undergone aggressive treatment, brain&#xD;
      metastasis (BM) is a frequent seen pattern of disease relapse, which cannot be ignored. It&#xD;
      still remains unresolved whether prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) via whole brain&#xD;
      radiotherapy (WBRT) should be recommended for NSCLC patients with stage III or pathologically&#xD;
      nodal positive disease. Actually, PCI would significantly decrease the incidence of BM;&#xD;
      however, potential WBRT-related neurocognitive function (NCF) sequelae are indeed a concern,&#xD;
      which has made PCI seldom applied in clinical practice. In terms of the time course of&#xD;
      WBRT-induced NCF decline, it might vary considerably according to the specific domains which&#xD;
      are selected to be measured. Early neurocognitive decline principally involve impairments of&#xD;
      episodic memory, which has been significantly associated with functions of the hippocampus.&#xD;
      This study thus aims to explore the impact of PCI on the subsequent risk of developing BM and&#xD;
      the multi-domain neurobehavioral functions in our eligible patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods. Potentially eligible subjects are postoperative NSCLC patients with a status of&#xD;
      pathologically nodal metastasis (pN+). Patients randomly assigned to the PCI arm will undergo&#xD;
      the course of hippocampal-sparing PCI after they complete the fourth course of adjuvant&#xD;
      platinum-based chemotherapy. Radiotherapy dose will be 3000 cGy in 15 fractions during three&#xD;
      weeks. Except for the administration of hippocampal-sparing PCI, patients assigned to the&#xD;
      observation arm should receive the same baseline and follow-up brain imaging examinations and&#xD;
      neurocognitive assessments as those in PCI arm. Accordingly, a battery of neuropsychological&#xD;
      measures, which includes 7 standardized neuropsychological tests (e.g., executive functions,&#xD;
      verbal &amp; non-verbal memory, working memory, and psychomotor speed), is used to evaluate&#xD;
      neurobehavioral functions for our registered patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results. This randomized controlled study aims to verify that the incidence of BM&#xD;
      still can significantly be reduced by hippocampal-sparing PCI; additionally, NCF preservation&#xD;
      regarding neurobehavioral assessments might also be achieved by hippocampal-sparing PCI as&#xD;
      compared with the observation arm without PCI. No matter what the final results present, it&#xD;
      is believed that this randomized controlled trial (RCT) will provide us solid evidence&#xD;
      concerning the exact value of hippocampal-sparing PCI in our patient setting.&#xD;

    <description>Neurocognitive assessment: including memory, executive functions, and psychomotor speed. This neurocognitive outcome was delayed recall, as determined by the change/decline in either verbal memory [Wechsler Memory Scale - 3rd edition (WMS III) - Word List score] or non-verbal memory (WMS III- Visual Reproduction score) from the baseline assessment to 4 months after the start of the course of WBRT with hippocampus avoidance (HA-WBRT). Additionally, the follow-up of neurocognitive assessment will also be administered at 12 months and up to 18 months after the start of PCI.</description>

    <description>All studied patients should undergo a computed tomography (CT) simulation scan encompassing the entire head region with 1.25-mm slice thickness using a thermoplastic mask for immobilization. To achieve conformal hippocampal sparing during the delivery of WBRT, the technique of volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) via Linac-based RapidArc® or TrueBeamTM is employed in our treatment planning. All treatment plans are delivered by using the Linac Varian-iX or TrueBeamTM. In terms of dose prescription, a dose of 30 Gy in 15 fractions is prescribed to whole-brain planning target volume (PTV) under the setting of prophylactic cranial irradiation for NSCLC patients.</description>
