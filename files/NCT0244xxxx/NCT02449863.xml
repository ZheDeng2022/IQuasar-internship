      Neonatal respiratory distress prognosis may be difficult to estimate at admission. Lung&#xD;
      ultrasound is a useful diagnostic tool that is quick, requires little training and is&#xD;
      radiation free. This study analyzes whether early lung ultrasound can predict respiratory&#xD;

      Neonatal respiratory distress prognosis may be difficult to estimate at admission. Lung&#xD;
      ultrasound is a useful diagnostic tool that is quick, requires little training and is&#xD;
      radiation free. This study analyzes whether early lung ultrasound can predict respiratory&#xD;
      failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods This study was conducted from January to December 2014 at Hospital Sant Joan de Déu&#xD;
      (Esplugues de Llobregat, Barcelona, Spain), a third-level hospital with 3300 births per year&#xD;
      and a neonatal intensive care unit with annual admission of 700 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local institutional review board of Hospital Sant Joan de Déu approved the protocol (project&#xD;
      approval number PIC-07-15) and written informed consent was obtained from all parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients older than 32 weeks admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit with respiratory&#xD;
      distress who were not on invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) were eligible for recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single operator, a neonatologist skilled in lung and heart sonography, performed the&#xD;
      examinations. Images were then analysed by another neonatologist with less experience in LUS.&#xD;
      He was blind to the perinatal history and chest radiography of the newborns and unaware of&#xD;
      the clinical diagnosis. Infants were from a non-consecutive convenience sample recruited when&#xD;
      the operator was available for the execution of LUS in the first 2 hours of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examinations were performed with a portable device (Siemens Acuson X) using a 10MHz linear&#xD;
      probe and previously warmed gel. Eight video clips were stored at each examination, which was&#xD;
      performed at the patient's bedside, with the neonate placed in a supine position. In each&#xD;
      hemithorax 4 regions were evaluated: parasternal area, anterolateral axillary area, posterior&#xD;
      axillary area, and the fifth intercostal space, by means of a transversal scan. The LUS&#xD;
      procedures were carried out in 1.5-2 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants were classified into 2 groups, according to the LUS pattern:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Low risk: Normal, transient tachypnea of the newborn.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  High risk: Respiratory distress syndrome, meconium aspiration syndrome, pneumothorax,&#xD;
           pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second investigator made the same classification after reading chest x-ray pictures.&#xD;
      Respiratory failure was defined as the need for invasive mechanical ventilation during the&#xD;
      first day of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single consultant, a neonatologist expert in lung disease, also blinded to the patient's&#xD;
      perinatal history and clinical condition, made the x-ray diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, another consultant neonatologist made the final clinical diagnosis taking into&#xD;
      account complete patient's medical history except LUS information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perinatal and anthropometric data (gestational age, weight, sex, antenatal steroids, and&#xD;
      delivery method) were collected from clinical charts and data regarding neonatal respiratory&#xD;
      evolution (hours of oxygen and ventilation, respiratory support-NIV, conventional MV, high&#xD;
      frequency oscillatory ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation-and need for&#xD;
      surfactant) were collected during admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics All data were analysed using IBM SPSS version 20.0 (IBM Corporation, USA).&#xD;
      Clinical features and respiratory outcomes were summarized using descriptive statistics&#xD;
      (frequency distribution for categorical data and mean and standard deviation or median and&#xD;
      interquartile range for continuous data). Univariate analysis included the Chi-square test&#xD;
      and Fisher's exact test, as appropriate, for categorical comparisons, and t-Student or&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney test for continuous variables. Wilson method was used to compute confidence&#xD;
      interval (CI). Cohen´s kappa coefficient was provided to assess agreement between sonographic&#xD;
      and radiologic risk patterns. Predictive values and related parameters (sensibility,&#xD;
      specificity and likelihood ratios) were calculated for both diagnostic tests (sonographic&#xD;
      pattern risk and radiologic pattern risk); ROC analysis was used to assess efficiency. CI of&#xD;
      Area Under the Curve was obtained by the exact method (Clopper-Pearson). All hypothesis tests&#xD;
      were two sided and p value less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.&#xD;
