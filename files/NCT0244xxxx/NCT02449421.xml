  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare the impact of two strategies to sustain and improve&#xD;
      the delivery of an evidence-based psychotherapy for PTSD, Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT)&#xD;
      in three different mental health systems. These approaches are based on two different&#xD;
      theories of what is necessary to promote successful implementation. We will examine whether&#xD;
      these strategies lead to improved patient outcomes, clinician skill, proportion of clients&#xD;
      who receive CPT, and other outcomes that are relevant to the implementation of evidence-based&#xD;
      psychosocial treatments. By examining these questions in 3 different mental health systems,&#xD;
      we will also examine whether the implementation strategies yield different results in&#xD;
      different systems.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project will compare two different methods of post-training support to promote sustained&#xD;
      and improved CPT delivery: Fidelity-oriented learning community (FID-LC) and Continuous&#xD;
      Quality Improvement Learning Community (CQI-LC). Clinics in which clinicians have previously&#xD;
      received CPT training will be randomly assigned to one of these conditions. Outcomes will be&#xD;
      observed changes in patient symptoms during and following treatment, independent expert&#xD;
      assessment of clinician fidelity and adaptations in delivering the psychotherapy (via&#xD;
      audio-recordings), proportion of eligible caseloads that receive CPT, and capacity to deliver&#xD;
      CPT. Data will also be collected to assess clinician and setting characteristics that may&#xD;
      contribute to the success of each strategy. The study results will help inform how best to&#xD;
      support the ongoing implementation and benefits of evidence-based psychotherapy (e.g., CPT)&#xD;
      in routine clinical settings. This is a knowledge translation project in partnership with 3&#xD;
      systems; VA Canada, U.S. Veterans Health Care System and the National Centre for PTSD.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in PTSD Symptoms over 6 months (PCL-5 measure)</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for an expected duration of 12 weeks of therapy. PCL-5 will be measured at baseline, at Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, post-treatment week, and at 3-month follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>The PCL-5 is a 20-item self-report measure that assesses the 20 DSM-5 symptoms of PTSD. Each item is measured on a 5-point Likert scale. The PCL will track change from baseline to the 3 month follow up.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fidelity Measure</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, at 12 and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The fidelity measure examines clinicians' adherence and competence to specific CPT interventions prescribed in each session. Clinicians are rated on their adherence to the protocol (on a 0-2 Likert-type scale), as well as their competence in delivery of these elements (rated on a 7-point, Likert-type scale).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Content-Level and Context-Level Adaptation</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, at 12 and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Using a framework and coding system of modifications and adaptations made to EBPs, sessions will be rated to identify 11 potential content-level adaptations, as well as 5 context-level modifications.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>CPT Activity Reporting</measure>
    <time_frame>monthly for up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>All clinicians will report monthly on CPT activity: caseload size, frequency, duration and satisfaction with the LC over the past month, number of new CPT patients, clinician confidence rating in their CPT delivery.</description>
