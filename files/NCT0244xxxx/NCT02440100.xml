    <textblock>
      This is an investigator-and-subject blind, phase 1 study to characterize the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics and central and peripheral pharmacodynamics of 14-day repeated&#xD;
      ascending doses of PF-06648671 once a day in healthy adults (part 1) and repeated doses at&#xD;
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) defined in part 1 in healthy elderly subjects (part 2). The&#xD;
      study also include an optional cohort (part 3) to evaluate the drug interaction between&#xD;
      PF-06648671 at MTD and CYP3A probe, midazolam&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Body Mass Index (BMI) of 17.5 to 30.5 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg (110 lbs).&#xD;

             untreated, asymptomatic, seasonal allergies at time of dosing) at the discretion of&#xD;
             the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. For Part 2 specific: Recent (eg, last 6 months) evidence or history of unstable&#xD;
             disease or moderate to severe conditions which would, in the Investigator's opinion,&#xD;

             including but not limited to anemia, liver disease, stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (eg, gastrectomy).&#xD;

             drinks/week for males (1 drink = 5 ounces (150 mL) of wine or 12 ounces (360 mL) of&#xD;
             beer or 1.5 ounces (45 mL) of hard liquor) within 6 months of Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days (or as determined by the local&#xD;
             requirement) or 5 half lives preceding the first dose of study medication, whichever&#xD;

             following at least 5 minutes of supine rest. If blood pressure (BP) is ≥ 140 mm Hg&#xD;
             (systolic) or 90 mm Hg (diastolic), the BP should be repeated two more times,&#xD;
             following 2 minutes rest and the average of the three BP values should be used to&#xD;
             determine the subject's eligibility.&#xD;

             QTcf exceeds 450 msec, or QRS exceeds 120 msec, the ECG should be repeated two more&#xD;
             times and the average of the three QTc or QRS values should be used to determine the&#xD;
             subject's eligibility.&#xD;
