    <textblock>
      Insomnia is a significant problem affecting 10 to 20% of US population. Long-term&#xD;
      pharmacological treatments are not recommended due to side effects, with therapy and sleep&#xD;
      hygiene education often employed as alternatives. Use of mind-body approaches for insomnia is&#xD;
      increasing. One of the most promising mind-body approaches for alleviating sleep problems is&#xD;
      hypnosis. Research indicates significant beneficial effects of hypnosis on sleep, but sleep&#xD;
      was rarely assessed as primary outcome and studied populations were diverse. Further, it&#xD;
      remains unclear who the best candidates for benefitting from hypnosis are. To address some of&#xD;
      the gaps in the current knowledge, the study evaluates whether 1) an addition of hypnotic&#xD;
      suggestion for sleep improvement to the optimizing sleep hygiene (OSH) program increases the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the OSH using objective and subjective assessments and 2) determines&#xD;
      characteristics associated with hypnotic responsiveness.To address these goals a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial (RCT) with 3 laboratory visits (baseline, intervention, and 1 month&#xD;
      follow-up) will be conducted with 50 adults meeting criteria for primary insomnia and&#xD;
      allocated to one the two groups: 1) experimental group receiving during the intervention&#xD;
      visit a combination of the Optimizing Sleep Hygiene (OSH) program and a hypnosis session for&#xD;
      sleep improvement and 2) a control group receiving at the intervention visit the OSH only.&#xD;
      Hypnosis session for sleep improvement for the control group will be offered at the end of&#xD;
      the follow-up study visit (conducted after 4 weeks post-intervention) after completing all&#xD;
      follow-up measures. Each study visit will last for 2-3 hours. During the visits sleep,&#xD;
      personality traits and daily function of the participants will be assessed. Further, after&#xD;
      the baseline and one week before the follow-up visit subjects will wear a watch-like&#xD;
      actigraphic device monitoring their sleep patterns at home and will complete sleep diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The knowledge gained from this study will inform the literature and clinicians about&#xD;
      usefulness of hypnosis for insomnia sufferers and will help identify the population of&#xD;
      insomnia sufferers most likely benefit from use of hypnosis for sleep&#xD;

      1. Protocol Title Improving sleep quality in people with insomnia&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Objectives The purpose of the study is to compare effectiveness of two sleep improvement&#xD;
           programs for people with primary psychophysiological insomnia: 1) the Optimizing Sleep&#xD;
           Hygiene (OSH) program and 2) a combination of the OSH and hypnosis for sleep&#xD;
           improvement. The goals of this study are: 1) using objective and subjective assessments&#xD;
           to evaluate whether an addition of hypnotic suggestion for sleep improvement to the&#xD;
           sleep hygiene program increases the effectiveness of the OSH, and 2) to determine&#xD;
           subject characteristics associated with hypnotic responsiveness in adults with primary&#xD;
           psychophysiological insomnia.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To address these goals a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 3 laboratory visits&#xD;
           (baseline, intervention, and 1-month follow-up) will be conducted with 50 adults meeting&#xD;
           criteria for psychophysiological insomnia and allocated to one the two groups: 1)&#xD;
           experimental group receiving during the intervention visit a combination of the&#xD;
           Optimizing Sleep Hygiene (OSH) program and a hypnosis session for sleep improvement and&#xD;
           2) a control group receiving at the intervention visit the OSH only. One-month follow-up&#xD;
           visit will be conducted following at least 4 weeks since the intervention visit.&#xD;
           Hypnosis session for sleep improvement for the control group will be offered at the end&#xD;
           of the follow-up study visit after completing all follow-up measures. Each study visit&#xD;
           will last for 2-3 hours. During the visits participants' personality traits, hypnotic&#xD;
           susceptibility as well as measures of insomnia severity, sleep quality, hygiene, and&#xD;
           daily function will be assessed. Further, between the visits at home subjects will wear&#xD;
           a watch-like actigraphic device monitoring their day and night activity. These&#xD;
           actigraphic recordings will allow for collecting objective actigraphic measures of&#xD;
           sleep. The actigraphic measures will be collected along with daily sleep and medications&#xD;
           diaries for periods of 7 days immediately after the baseline assessment and 1 week prior&#xD;
           to one-month follow-up assessment. Additionally, during the one-month follow-up visit,&#xD;
           patterns of brain activity will be monitored in all subjects first when they listen to a&#xD;
           neutral sleep-related recording and then during listening to a recording of hypnosis for&#xD;
           sleep improvement. The purpose of these measures is to compare brain activity patterns&#xD;
           and identify specific biomarkers of hypnotic state. Four weeks after the completion of&#xD;
           all study visits participants will provide information about their sleep and their&#xD;
           experiences with the study interventions components via a telephone or on-line&#xD;
           assessment depending on their choice.The knowledge gained from this study will inform&#xD;
           the literature and clinicians about usefulness of hypnosis for insomnia sufferers and&#xD;
           will help identify the population most likely benefit from use of hypnosis for sleep.&#xD;
           The goals of the proposal will be addressed by the following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Specific Aim 1: Compare changes from baseline in sleep parameters at the one-month&#xD;
           follow-up visit between the two study groups (experimental and control) after exposure&#xD;
           to the interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis: Greater improvements in actigraphic and subjective sleep parameters and&#xD;
           daily function will be observed in the experimental group compared to the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Specific Aim 2a: Identify characteristics correlating with changes in measures of sleep&#xD;
           quality to describe a population that can potentially benefit from hypnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis: Several sleep-specific variables (e.g. specific baseline insomnia symptoms&#xD;
           and sleep hygiene problems) and personality features (e.g. hypnotic susceptibility and&#xD;
           specific personality traits) will correlate with post-intervention changes in sleep&#xD;
           variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Specific Aim 2b: Identify characteristics correlating with hypnotic susceptibility for&#xD;
           creating a scale that can be used in a clinic to assess hypnotic responsiveness for&#xD;
           sleep-related problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis: Using the items from the instruments given during the study identified as a&#xD;
           part of Specific Aim 2a short instrument could be constructed that can quickly and&#xD;
           reliably categorize people based on their hypnotic responsiveness for sleep-related&#xD;
           problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Specific Aim 3: Assess brain wave patterns concurrent with hypnosis to identify&#xD;
           psychophysiological markers specific to hypnotic state in order to describe mechanisms&#xD;
           underlying hypnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis: Based on the differences between the two states: 1) listening to hypnosis&#xD;
           and 2) listening to a neutral sleep-related recording, brain activity markers that can&#xD;
           distinguish state of hypnosis from the state of listening to a neutral recording could&#xD;
           be identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Background Insomnia, characterized by non-restorative sleep or by difficulty in&#xD;
           initiating or maintaining sleep, is a significant problem affecting 10 to 20% of US&#xD;
           population. Poor sleep impairs cognitive and immune functions, mood and productivity of&#xD;
           sufferers and can increase risk for hypertension, diabetes, cancer and overall&#xD;
           mortality. Long-term pharmacological insomnia treatment is not recommended due to side&#xD;
           effects, with therapy and sleep hygiene education often employed as alternatives. There&#xD;
           is also a growing interest in using mind-body approaches for managing sleep problems.&#xD;
           Mind-body approaches are becoming popular due to accessibility and low side effect&#xD;
           profile, as well as due to increasing amount of research evidence indicating their&#xD;
           effectiveness. For example, a recent review of mind-body methods for improving sleep&#xD;
           revealed that among the most promising mind-body approaches for alleviating sleep&#xD;
           problems was hypnosis. Hypnosis is a state of relaxation combined with highly focused&#xD;
           attention and characterized by dissociation of competing thoughts and sensations towards&#xD;
           the periphery of awareness. One way to achieve hypnotic state is through an induction&#xD;
           procedure typically followed by hypnotic suggestions or statements intended to elicit&#xD;
           behavioral change. Efficacy of hypnosis has been demonstrated for several conditions,&#xD;
           most notably for decreasing pain and alleviating stress-related disorders. Using&#xD;
           hypnosis for sleep improvement is still a developing area of research. Though several&#xD;
           studies found significant beneficial effects of hypnosis on sleep, most studies used&#xD;
           hypnosis for alleviating other problems influencing sleep (e.g. hot flashes) rather than&#xD;
           specifically targeting sleep as the primary focus of improvement. Moreover, majority of&#xD;
           the studies on sleep and hypnosis used only subjective measures for evaluating sleep&#xD;
           quality. Further, it remains unclear who the best candidates for benefitting from&#xD;
           hypnosis are and how hypnotic responsiveness can be assessed in a clinic without lengthy&#xD;
           tests of hypnotic susceptibility. To address some of the gaps in the current knowledge,&#xD;
           the goals of this study are: 1) using objective and subjective assessments to evaluate&#xD;
           whether an addition of hypnotic suggestion for sleep improvement to the sleep hygiene&#xD;
           education program increases the program effectiveness, and 2) to determine subject&#xD;
           characteristics associated with hypnotic responsiveness in adults with primary&#xD;
           psychophysiological insomnia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Design: The planned study is a single-blind two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT)&#xD;
           with three study visits (baseline, intervention, and one-month follow-up), with&#xD;
           participants randomly assigned to receive Optimizing Sleep Hygiene (OSH) program as an&#xD;
           intervention either alone or in conjunction with hypnosis for sleep improvement during&#xD;
           the intervention visit.&#xD;
