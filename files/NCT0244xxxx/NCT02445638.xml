  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this randomized, single blinded cross-over study is to investigate effects&#xD;
      of daily egg versus yolk-free egg substitute consumption on High Density Lipoprotein (HDL)&#xD;
      composition and function in a population of overweight and obese postmenopausal women.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that after 4 weeks of daily consumption of whole egg versus&#xD;
      yolk-free egg will result in differences in the HDL composition and profile of lipids and&#xD;
      proteins (lipidome and proteome), which will be associated with changes in HDL functionality.&#xD;
      It is further hypothesized that it will be possible to discriminate between responders and&#xD;
      non-responders to eggs in terms of increasing both apolipoprotein A-1 (ApoA-I) content in the&#xD;
      plasma, corresponding with more protective HDL particles; and increasing HDL functionality&#xD;
      (cholesterol efflux and anti-oxidant capacity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will consume an egg free diet during study protocols, except for the egg meal&#xD;
      provided by the study. The study is comprised of two 4-week feeding periods with a 4-week&#xD;
      washout between testing periods. While on the study, subjects will consume the equivalent of&#xD;
      two eggs for breakfast, either whole egg or yolk-free egg. Following a 2-week low-egg lead-in&#xD;
      period, subjects will be randomly selected to start on either arm and cross over to the other&#xD;
      arm after the 4-week washout period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measured results will be compared between the baseline and the 4-week end point for each arm.&#xD;
      Additional comparisons may be made between 4-week endpoints.&#xD;
