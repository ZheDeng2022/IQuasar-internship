      Involved-field radiotherapy (IFRT) after effective chemotherapy is a common strategy for&#xD;
      patients with stage III-IV DLBCL. There is not a clinical trial to research whether the&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.&#xD;
      Approximately 50% of patients present with stage III-IV disease at diagnosis. The standard&#xD;
      treatment approach for these patients is combination chemotherapy. the role of radiation&#xD;
      therapy (RT) after effective system therapy in stage III-IV DLBCL (advanced-stage DLBCL) is&#xD;
      controversial. The recommended approaches for patients with stage III-IV disease by The&#xD;
      National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) are that consolidation RT is managed for&#xD;
      patients who achieved a complete response (CR) to chemotherapy and palliative RT for patients&#xD;
      with partial response (PR) after chemotherapy. However, it is uncertain for the radiotherapy&#xD;
      field size to treat for these patients after chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some benefits of consolidation RT after chemotherapy exist for patients with advanced-stage&#xD;
      DLBCL. One of the important aims of treatment for these patients is the improvement of&#xD;
      event-free survival (EFS). After patients receive chemotherapy alone, the most common site of&#xD;
      disease recurrence is at sites of initial disease involvement. The complications related to&#xD;
      chemotherapy, including second malignancies and other non-neoplastic late events, were needed&#xD;
      to emphasize for those patients managed with more cycles' regimens alone to increase the&#xD;
      efficacy of patients with advanced-stage DLBCL. Receipt of consolidation RT was associated&#xD;
      with improved in-field control and EFS though no difference in overall survival (OS) when&#xD;
      compared to patients without consolidation RT. Several randomized and retrospective studies&#xD;
      demonstrated that the EFS (even the OS) can be improved by consolidation RT for patients with&#xD;
      advanced-stage DLBCL after CHOP or CHOP-like chemotherapy. The patients randomized among&#xD;
      those diagnosed initially with bulky disease (&gt;10 cm), those achieving CR or PR after&#xD;
      chemotherapy, and even those in stage IV with bone marrow involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The complications related to consolidation RT also need to be additionally explored for those&#xD;
      patients since the efficacy of advanced-stage DLBCL has improved by combined-modality therapy&#xD;
      (CMT). Especially, considerable difficulties in the continuous salvage options are&#xD;
      unavoidable because of the risk of blood cell production disorders associated to&#xD;
      extensive-field radiotherapy. Consolidation involved-field radiotherapy (IFRT) after&#xD;
      effective chemotherapy is common palliative strategy for patients with advanced-stage DLBCL.&#xD;
      The morbidity of treatment may be decreased further by RT with the radiation field size&#xD;
      reduction. Involved-site radiotherapy (ISRT), based on a modified involved field, aims to&#xD;
      reduce the radiation volume treated and the probability of late effects. Its radiation&#xD;
      targets include a gross tumor volume (GTV), a clinical target volume (CTV), and a planning&#xD;
      target volume (PTV), which were defined in International Commission on Radiation Units and&#xD;
      Measurements Report (ICRU) 50. This is based on defining the site of gross disease before&#xD;
      chemotherapy, the GTV and using a CT-based volume with an expansion to form a CTV in the&#xD;
      cranio-caudal direction. There is not a clinical trial to research whether the sequential&#xD;
      narrowed radiotherapy field size (involved-site radiotherapy, ISRT) can obtain the same&#xD;
      efficacy as IFRT and decrease toxicities related to radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the differences between IFRT and ISRT in the efficacy and complications related&#xD;
      to consolidation RT for patients with advanced-stage DLBCL who achieved effective&#xD;
      chemotherapy. The CTV of ISRT is defined as the region including the prechemotherapy volume&#xD;
      of disease with 1.5 cm margin expanded cranio-caudally in the direction of potential&#xD;
      lymphatic spread. The CTV should not extend into air in the transverse plane and should be&#xD;
      limited in the involved lymph node region defined by the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB).&#xD;
      The PTV is then extended from CTV by adding the necessary margin for setup error and organ&#xD;
      motion.&#xD;
