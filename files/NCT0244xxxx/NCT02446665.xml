  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic liver disease that can lead to liver&#xD;
      cirrhosis, liver failure and liver cancer. Assessment of disease status is important to&#xD;
      determine optimal treatment but the diagnosis of PSC is challenging. There is a dire need of&#xD;
      an accurate non-invasive tool for longitudinal assessment of PSC. MR Elastography (MRE) has&#xD;
      been recently proven to estimate liver fibrosis noninvasively and accurately. Estimation of&#xD;
      liver fibrosis by MRE along with imaging derived morphological information (MRCP) will be&#xD;
      utilized in this study comprehensively to provide a surrogate non-invasive imaging biomarker&#xD;
      for monitoring disease status in PSC. Successful outcomes will provide an opportunity for&#xD;
      optimal treatment triage including liver transplantation via accurate and non-invasive&#xD;
      estimation of true disease status in PSC.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic liver disease that causes inflammation and&#xD;
      obstruction of bile ducts. It can eventually lead to liver cirrhosis due to fibrosis, liver&#xD;
      failure and liver cancer. The diagnosis of PSC is challenging as there is no single&#xD;
      diagnostic test and usually involves a multidisciplinary approach with MRI playing a major&#xD;
      role. Assessment of disease status is important to triage patients for optimal treatment&#xD;
      including liver transplantation and prevention of liver failure. There are however no&#xD;
      established blood tests that can reliably track the disease progression and repeated liver&#xD;
      biopsies have multiple drawbacks including complications, costs and feasibility. There is a&#xD;
      dire need of an accurate non-invasive tool for longitudinal assessment of PSC. MR&#xD;
      Elastography (MRE) has been recently proven to estimate liver fibrosis noninvasively and&#xD;
      accurately. Estimation of liver fibrosis by MRE along with imaging derived morphological&#xD;
      information (MRCP) will be utilized in this study comprehensively to provide a surrogate&#xD;
      non-invasive imaging biomarker for monitoring disease status in PSC. The patients would have&#xD;
      or will agree to undergo a liver FibroScan examination to grade fibrosis within 3 months of&#xD;
      the MRI examination. In addition to the standard protocol liver and biliary MR examination&#xD;
      including MRCP and contrast enhanced imaging, MRE will be added to the study exam following&#xD;
      informed consent. A control group of non-PSC subjects with known chronic liver disease such&#xD;
      as chronic viral hepatitis who have had liver biopsy and FibroScan within similar time frame&#xD;
      of 3 months, to assess fibrosis grade will also undergo MR Elastography in order to validate&#xD;
      the results of fibrosis by MRE. The study has significant implications for care of patients&#xD;
      with PSC. Successful outcomes will provide an opportunity for optimal treatment triage&#xD;
      including liver transplantation via accurate and non-invasive estimation of true disease&#xD;
      status in PSC.&#xD;
