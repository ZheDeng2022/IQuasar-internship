      The purpose now is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. identify brain connections related to proprioception to have a better understanding of&#xD;
           differences between people with stroke and healthy persons&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. evaluate how these brain connections will change in people with stroke when they are&#xD;
           engaged in 6-week cognitive multisensory rehabilitation.&#xD;

    <description>The robots will be used for research in healthy adults and stroke patients in the proposed studies below and are designed to mimick the exercises given during cognitive multisensory rehabilitation. The robots have been tested and cleared by the 3T safety committee at the CMRR, U of M. The first objective is a feasibility study to investigate the brain mechanisms of cognitive multisensory rehabilitation, through use of the robot in the 3T scanner at the U of M in healthy participants with stroke. Changes in brain function will be measured in individuals with stroke who will receive 8 weeks of therapy.</description>
