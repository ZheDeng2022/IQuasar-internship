      Systemically healthy periodontitis patients are recruited from new referrals to the&#xD;
      Department of Periodontology and Biology of Implants, AUTh. After completion of non-surgical&#xD;
      periodontal treatment those subjects who have at least one interdental osseous defect with&#xD;
      probing pocket depth and clinical attachment level of ≥ 6mm and an intrabony component of ≥&#xD;
      3mm with no endodontic or furcation involvement are randomly allocated into one of the three&#xD;
      treatment groups. Group A receives regenerative treatment using autologous bone marrow&#xD;
      mesenchymal stem cells free of animal derived reagents, produced in clean room facilities and&#xD;
      seeded into collagen scaffolds enriched with fibrin glue; in Group B, a collagen fleece&#xD;
      enriched with fibrin glue devoid of stem cells fills the osseous defect; Group C receives&#xD;
      open flap debridement retaining the soft wall of the defect. Thereafter, subjects are&#xD;
      followed for 12 months and are repeatedly assessed based on clinical, radiographic,&#xD;
      immunological and microbiological parameters.&#xD;

      Aims &amp; Objectives The present study describes a novel method to regenerate periodontal&#xD;
      tissues in periodontal infrabony defects using autologous BM-MSCs, free of animal derived&#xD;
      reagents, produced in clean room facilities enriched with autologous fibrin glue and seeded&#xD;
      into commercially available collagen scaffolds (collagen fleece).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective This study aims to assess the efficacy of a novel regenerative treatment of&#xD;
      periodontal infrabony defects using a biocomplex of BM-MSCs/fibrin glue/collagen fleece, as&#xD;
      compared to a cell-free grafting substitute of fibrin glue/collagen fleece and to a control&#xD;
      treatment approach of open flap debridement with no adjunctive use of grafting materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To document the stability of the enhanced treatment outcome and to continue to assess&#xD;
           the safety and effectiveness of BM-MSCs transplantation as compared to the control&#xD;
           treatment of open flap debridement over the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the immunological and microbiological profiles of the participants throughout&#xD;
           the study period in an attempt to understand local and systemic effects of the&#xD;
           transplantation of BM-MSCs in chronically diseased sites, such as the infrabony&#xD;
           periodontal defect. In addition, the healing response to treatment will be determined&#xD;
           throughout the observation period (baseline to 12-months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational products aBM-MSCs cultures will be established from osseous biopsies derived&#xD;
      from bone marrow of the alveolar bone in each patient belonging to Group A. Briefly, after a&#xD;
      thorough oral rinse with chlorhexidine 0.12% for 1min, an osteotomy using a trephine drill&#xD;
      will be performed in the alveolar bone and a 2x8 mm osseous core will be harvested. The area&#xD;
      will be irrigated with saline solution and then flaps will be sutured to achieve primary&#xD;
      closure at the donor site. The bone sample will be then immediately placed in sterile tubes&#xD;
      containing HBSS and antibiotics/antimycotics and will be transported to a Good Laboratory&#xD;
      Practice (GLP)-compliant authorized facility meeting the quality guidelines set by the&#xD;
      European Union for the preparation of clinical-grade stem cell cultures for delivery to the&#xD;
      patient. aBM-MSC isolation will be performed using the enzymatic dissociation method, as&#xD;
      previously described (Bakopoulou 2013). For culture expansion, autologous serum obtained from&#xD;
      60ml of venous blood collected from each subject will be used to supplement aMEM cell culture&#xD;
      medium, in order to avoid the use of any animal derived reagents, such as bovine serum. The&#xD;
      osseous biopsy will be immediately processed to ensure high viability of the established&#xD;
      cultures. After expansion for two passages (approximate time needed 16-24 days depending on&#xD;
      cell donor) cells will be harvested for delivery to the patient. For cell dissociation and&#xD;
      passaging, highly purified, GMP compatible recombinant enzymes (Tryple, Thermo Fisher&#xD;
      Scientific) will be used to avoid use of porcine trypsin. At this stage, a sample of 20ml&#xD;
      venous blood will be required for the preparation of the autologous fibrin glue in Group B,&#xD;
      as in Group A initial bloodletting (60ml) will cover the needs of the cell cultures and&#xD;
      fibrin glue preparation. Subsequently, fibrin glue will be loaded with- (Group A) or without-&#xD;
      (Group B) stem cells into a commercially available collagen fleece scaffold directly before&#xD;
      clinical application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality control of the established BM-MSC cultures before clinical application&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before delivery to the patient, all BM-MSCs cultures will be evaluated for:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Viability using Trypan Blue exclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sterility: cultures will be tested for potential contamination from bacteria, mycoplasma&#xD;
           and endotoxins (LAL test)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &quot;Stemness&quot; properties based on the minimal criteria established by the International&#xD;
           Society for Cellular Therapy (ISCT) regarding MSCs (Dominici et al 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note: Methodology on stem cell characterization methods is analytically described in previous&#xD;
      publications by our research group (Bakopoulou et al. 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After application of the BM-MSCs/fibrin glue/CaCl2 mixture into the collagen scaffolds, a&#xD;
      small sample of the biocomplex of randomly selected cases will be separated using surgical&#xD;
      scissors and will be transferred to the lab for further (in parallel to the clinical&#xD;
      application) ex vivo characterization of stem cell behavior in a biomimetic microenvironment.&#xD;
      This will allow correlation between stem cell behavior and the clinical outcome, since&#xD;
      retrieval and analysis of the regenerated tissues directly from the host is not feasible for&#xD;
      ethical reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparation of autologous fibrin glue Twenty ml of venous blood will be collected from the&#xD;
      ante-cubital fossa of patients in Groups A and B and blood samples will be immediately&#xD;
      transferred to a falcon tube, which contains anticoagulant. After determination of the&#xD;
      platelet counts the blood sample will be centrifuged (2000rpm, 10min) and plasma will be&#xD;
      separated and stored in another falcon. Platelets counts will be then determined and the&#xD;
      sample will be centrifuged again. PRP (platelet rich plasma containing 1,000,000 plts/ul)&#xD;
      will be then separated from the supernatant PPP (platelet poor plasma) and both preparations&#xD;
      will be further processed following a standard protocol for fibrin glue preparation&#xD;
      (Biohellenika, Thessaloniki, Greece).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design of the clinical arm of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-selection of Subjects Subjects will be recruited from new referrals at the Department of&#xD;
      Preventive Dentistry, Periodontology and Implant Biology; no external advertising or&#xD;
      recruitment will be undertaken. Subjects will be in good general health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Admission into the Study Before admission into the study, each subject will be informed by&#xD;
      the principal investigator of the nature and risks of the study both orally and in writing&#xD;
      (Subject Information Form) and written informed consent (Subject Informed Consent Signature&#xD;
      Form) will be obtained. Each subject will be given a copy of their duly signed consent form&#xD;
      to maintain for their own records. The subjects' personal demographics and medical history&#xD;
      and study suitability in accordance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria set in the&#xD;
      protocol will be recorded. Subjects may continue any medications not included in the&#xD;
      exclusion criteria; however, these medications should be documented together with any&#xD;
      concurrent medical condition not pre-excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures for Subject Withdrawal or Discontinuation Any subject, who wishes to withdraw from&#xD;
      the study for personal or any other reason, is entitled to do so. However, the reason for the&#xD;
      withdrawal of any subject from the study in addition to whether the reason is related to the&#xD;
      test product will be recorded by the principal investigator. Any participant failing to&#xD;
      attend more than twice is removed from the study. Subjects that experience an adverse event&#xD;
      will be excluded from further participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a subject wishes to withdraw from the study, all efforts will be made to complete and&#xD;
      report the observations as thoroughly as possible up to the date of withdrawal. Subjects will&#xD;
      be asked to consider giving further information as to the reason(s) for the withdrawal. Any&#xD;
      information reported will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Duration of each subject participation Each subject is expected to attend nine&#xD;
      visits in total over a period of 12 months; one screening visit, one treatment visit to&#xD;
      receive surgical treatment of the designated area, four follow-up reviews and three&#xD;
      additional visits for clinical and radiographic reassessment and sample collection (whole&#xD;
      saliva, gingival crevicular fluid (GCF), subgingival plaque).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators' calibration and randomisation Patients will be screened for eligibility by one&#xD;
      examiner and will be enrolled one at a time on a continuous basis after obtaining a code&#xD;
      number. A trial contributor not involved in data collection will perform the randomisation&#xD;
      and announce the treatment modality to the therapist using telephone communication. Clinical&#xD;
      assessments will be carried out by a single examiner who will have no access to previous&#xD;
      recordings and is not otherwise involved in other clinical procedures. An investigator&#xD;
      calibration exercise will be performed to obtain acceptable intra-examiner reproducibility&#xD;
      for PPD, CAL, and evaluation of defect anatomy. Intra-examiner reproducibility will be&#xD;
      evaluated by Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) and Bland-Altman 95% limits of&#xD;
      agreement (Bland and Altman, 1999).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis of experimental data The analysis will be performed using the IBM&#xD;
      Statistics SPSS 20.0, software. Data will be expressed as means +/- standard deviation (SD).&#xD;
      Unbalances between the test and control groups that are generated by the randomisation&#xD;
      procedures will be assessed using the independent samples t-test for continuous variables and&#xD;
      the Fisher's Exact test or the Chi-Square test for categorical variables. The significance of&#xD;
      the treatment effects on the dependent variables CAL changes, PPD changes and radiographic&#xD;
      changes will be estimated by constructing linear mixed models using the SPSS MIXED procedure.&#xD;
      For all analyses the statistical significance will be set at p&lt;0.05.&#xD;

      ISBT 128 barcoding system, Temperature -Liquid N2 level, Security Alarms and two power&#xD;
      generators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Schedule Clinical design and interventions for autologous transplantation of BM-MSCs&#xD;
      Subjects with severe chronic periodontitis will be scheduled to receive non-surgical&#xD;
      periodontal treatment under local anaesthesia using hand and power driven instruments, in&#xD;
      addition to motivation in periodontal care and thorough oral hygiene instructions. Subjects&#xD;
      will be clinically reassessed six weeks after the completion of non-surgical treatment and&#xD;
      those subjects with remaining periodontal pockets (PPD &amp; CAL ≥ 6mm; infrabony component ≥&#xD;
      3mm) and no overt signs of gingival inflammation will be screened for suitability to&#xD;
      participate in the current study. The screening visit will include an initial full-mouth&#xD;
      periodontal examination, intra-oral radiographic examination and fulfilment of&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria. In case of suitability, the nature of the study will be&#xD;
      explained in detail to all subjects and a signed consent form approved by the Ethics&#xD;
      Committee of the Dental School, AUTh. will be obtained from each participant. Then, patients&#xD;
      will be randomly allocated into one of the three treatment Groups (-A, -B and -C). A single&#xD;
      defect will be treated in each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently, an osseous biopsy and blood samples will be collected from the participants of&#xD;
      Group A under strict sterile conditions. Each sample will be then immediately placed in&#xD;
      sterile tubes and will be transported to Biohellenika, Thessaloniki, Greece&#xD;
      (http://www.biohellenika.gr) for stem cell isolation and expansion according to a strict&#xD;
      protocol (Bakopoulou et al. 2013, Bakopoulou et al. in preparation). Since MSCs will be&#xD;
      isolated and expanded in vitro in GLP-class clean rooms meeting the quality guidelines set by&#xD;
      the European Union and no animal derived reagents will be used throughout the experiments for&#xD;
      autologous transplantation, the cells are considered safe for human clinical cell therapy&#xD;
      applications. In Biohellenika facilities 60ml of venous blood will be collected from each&#xD;
      subject in Group A shortly after the biopsy harvest, so that autologous serum is used for the&#xD;
      isolation and culture expansion of the autologous stem cells. In addition, autologous fibrin&#xD;
      glue will be used to load the BM-MSCs onto the collagen fleece. In addition, a blood sample&#xD;
      of 20ml will be collected from subjects in Group B, in order to provide fibrin glue which&#xD;
      will enrich the collagen fleece before surgical placement into the osseous defect. Finally,&#xD;
      subjects in Group C will not be called for bloodletting as the infrabony defects in these&#xD;
      individuals will be surgically managed by open flap debridement with no adjunctive use of&#xD;
      grafting materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the GLP quality control, the MSCs will be analysed for sterility and endotoxins&#xD;
      and will be also tested for potential contamination from bacteria (BD BACTEC™), mycoplasma&#xD;
      and endotoxins (LAL test).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local anaesthesia (1.8ml of 2% lidocaine with 1:80,000 epinephrine; Lignospan special,&#xD;
      Septodont) will be infiltrated in the buccal and lingual aspects of the involved teeth&#xD;
      avoiding the papillae. Then, strictly intra-sulcular incisions will be performed to preserve&#xD;
      the gingival tissues and in particular the interdental papilla associated with the&#xD;
      bone-dental defect (Cortellini, 2012; Cortellini and Tonetti 2007). The defect will be&#xD;
      debrided and the root will be carefully planed with the combined use of Gracey curettes and&#xD;
      power-driven instruments (EMS Piezon®, EMS, Nyon, Switzerland). Care will be taken to retain&#xD;
      the soft-tissue wall of the defects and the osseous defect will be irrigated with saline to&#xD;
      control bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Group A, the grafting material (BM-MSCs enriched with fibrin glue) will be delivered in&#xD;
      two insulin syringes each containing 5x10E6 cells/100μl fibrin and will be gently loaded onto&#xD;
      the collagen fleece and polymerized with the addition of CaCl2. Subsequently, the biocomplex&#xD;
      will be gently packed into the defect until complete fill. Handling of the scaffold is done&#xD;
      with care to avoid any destruction of viable cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Group B, the collagen fleece enriched with fibrin glue devoid of viable cells will fill&#xD;
      the vertical bone defect with caution. In Groups -A and -B the delivery of fibrin glue&#xD;
      with/without viable cells will be identical, so that the therapist is blinded to the&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group C, patients will receive open flap debridement and root planing of the root surface in&#xD;
      a similar manner as subjects in Groups -A and -B, but there will be no adjunctive use of&#xD;
      grafting materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The operator will be blinded to the treatment modality (Groups -A and -B), while in Group C&#xD;
      since no grafting materials will be used, the treatment modality will become obvious to the&#xD;
      operator but this will take place towards the conclusion of the surgery, after the collection&#xD;
      of clinical data. Papilla preservation techniques and minimally invasive surgical techniques&#xD;
      will be sought in all groups, avoiding scoring the periosteum. Flaps will be repositioned and&#xD;
      sutured using a single modified internal mattress suture (5-0 Monosyn, Braun) at the&#xD;
      defect-associated interdental area and similar sutures will be employed to close the flaps in&#xD;
      any other interdental areas. Two weeks post-surgery clinical observation for uneventful&#xD;
      healing or presence of adverse tissue reaction will be performed followed by suture removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative care Post-operative pain will be controlled with Ibuprofen (600mg) at the end&#xD;
      of the surgical procedure and 12h later if in pain. Amoxicillin (500mg / 8 hours for five&#xD;
      days) will be prescribed to all participants. All patients will be instructed to use 0.12%&#xD;
      chlorhexidine twice daily and avoid brushing, flossing and chewing hard in the treated area&#xD;
      for four weeks. During this 4-week period, stringent post-operative supportive program care&#xD;
      will be instituted at bi-weekly intervals, and after that patients will discontinue rinsing&#xD;
      with chlorhexidine solution and resume oral hygiene. Interdental cleaning will commence six&#xD;
      weeks post-surgery for all Groups. Thereafter, subjects will be seen at three, six and 12&#xD;
      months for periodontal supportive care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical recordings Full-mouth and site-specific periodontal recordings including BOP; Plaque&#xD;
      Index (presence/absence of plaque); PPD and CAL will be determined using a manual periodontal&#xD;
      probe (Hu-Friedy XP-23/QW) to the nearest millimetre at six sites per tooth and parallel to&#xD;
      the long axis at four time-points; baseline, 6-, 9-, 12-months. Clinical measurements at the&#xD;
      designated sites (infrabony defects) will be determined prior to surgery and before&#xD;
      anaesthesia (baseline). Intra-surgical assessments will be carried out once during surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-surgical clinical assessments The defect morphology (one-, two-, three-walls or&#xD;
      combination) will be determined intra-surgically by the number of bone walls associated with&#xD;
      the lesion; The distance between the cemento-enamel junction and the bottom of the defect&#xD;
      (CEJ-BD) will be determined in mm; The distance from the CEJ to the most coronal&#xD;
      interproximal level of the bone crest (CEJ-BC) will be determined in mm; The total defect&#xD;
      depth: the distance between the bone crest and the bottom of the defect (BC-BD) will be&#xD;
      determined in mm; The width of the defect width (horizontal distance between the bone crest&#xD;
      and the root surface) will be determined in mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the CEJ is not detectable due to a cervical restoration the restoration margin (RM) will&#xD;
      serve as reference point for clinical and radiographic measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiographic evaluation Intraoral digital radiography will be utilised to determine the bone&#xD;
      regeneration of the infrabony defects at six time points; baseline, 6-weeks, 3-, 6-, 9-,&#xD;
      12-months. Standardised periapical digital radiographs (RadioVisioGraphy; Trophy Radiology&#xD;
      S.A., Paris, France) will be obtained using the long-cone paralleling technique. To&#xD;
      standardise the exposure geometry, a customised bite-block of an elastic impression material&#xD;
      will be adjusted on the sensor holder, stored in sealed plastic containers at room&#xD;
      temperature and will be reused during every recall radiographic appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a similar manner as the intra-surgical assessment, the following anatomical landmarks will&#xD;
      be defined on the x-rays: the cementoenamel junction (CEJ), the most coronal level of the&#xD;
      alveolar bone (BC) and the apical extent of bone loss (BD). In more detail, the location of&#xD;
      the CEJ will be identified; the most coronal area where the periodontal ligament retains an&#xD;
      even width will be identified on the radiograph to indicate the most apical extension of bone&#xD;
      loss. The infrabony defect will be calculated by measuring the width of the defect at the&#xD;
      most coronal aspect and at the base; the distance between CEJ-BD and BC-BD; the distance&#xD;
      between CEJ-BC; the angle between the vertical axis of the root and the interdental bone wall&#xD;
      (Tonetti et al. 1993). Radiographic evaluation of bone regeneration will be defined on a high&#xD;
      definition monitor by the same calibrated examiner who is blinded to the treatment modality&#xD;
      and does not have access to previous recordings. Assessments will be carried out using the&#xD;
      measurement tool for numerical measurements (VixWin™ Platinum|Gendex software) with reference&#xD;
      to a metal bar of standard length (5mm) that will be attached onto the sensor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of specimens Samples will be collected in the following order at six time points;&#xD;
      baseline, 6-weeks, 3-, 6-, 9-, 12-months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) Saliva Saliva will be collected prior to clinical periodontal measurements or any&#xD;
      periodontal intervention and generally in the morning following an overnight fast during&#xD;
      which subjects are requested not to drink (except water) or chew gum. Whole saliva samples&#xD;
      will be obtained by expectorating into 30ml polypropylene tubes for 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (ii) GCF Gingival crevicular fluid samples will be obtained from the buccal interdental&#xD;
      aspects of the defects. Before GCF collection, the surfaces will be gently air dried and&#xD;
      isolated from saliva by placing cotton rolls and using a saliva ejector. Then, supragingival&#xD;
      plaque will be carefully removed with sterile curettes and paper strips (Periopaper, OraFlow&#xD;
      Inc., Smithtown, NY, USA) will be placed in the periodontal pocket until mild resistance is&#xD;
      felt for 30s. Care will be taken to avoid mechanical trauma when placing the strips and those&#xD;
      strips contaminated with blood will be discarded. Each strip per patient will be stored in a&#xD;
      separate 1.5ml micro-centrifuge tube, and stored at -70°C. Prior to use, the proteins on the&#xD;
      strips will be eluted into 500µl of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with BSA (1%&#xD;
      v/v).&#xD;
&#xD;
      (iii) Plaque Following GCF collection, subgingival plaque will be collected from the&#xD;
      designated site. The sampling area will be isolated from saliva, gently dried with air, and&#xD;
      after ensuring that no supragingival plaque deposits are present two paper points will be&#xD;
      placed for 30s into the periodontal pocket and a pooled sample will be collected. All samples&#xD;
      will be stored in Eppendorf tubes (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) at -80°C before processing.&#xD;
      Paper points will be used for the collection of microbial plaque in order to avoid mechanical&#xD;
      disturbance of the periodontal tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management The investigators must ensure that the subject's anonymity is maintained. On&#xD;
      any study-related documentation, subjects should only be identifiable by their initials,&#xD;
      gender, and/or subject number. Personal information (i.e. medical cards) will be kept in a&#xD;
      separate, secure location, away from other study specific data with restricted access to the&#xD;
      principal investigator only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent process It is the responsibility of the principal investigator to obtain in&#xD;
      writing consent from the subject. The informed consent form will consist of two separate&#xD;
      documents; a Subject Information Form and a Subject Informed Consent Signature Form; both&#xD;
      documents will be approved by the Ethical committee of the Dental School, AUTh prior to the&#xD;
      study. The subject information form will provide an adequate explanation, in native&#xD;
      non-technical language that is understandable to the subject, of the aims, objectives,&#xD;
      methods, anticipated benefits and potential hazards of the study. The principal investigator&#xD;
      must then provide ample time for the subject to read and understand the informed consent form&#xD;
      and to consider participation in the clinical investigation. The principal investigator and&#xD;
      the subject must both sign and date the form before the subject can participate in the&#xD;
      clinical investigation. Each subject will then be issued with a copy of their duly signed and&#xD;
      dated informed consent form and any other written information.&#xD;
