  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed study is to determine the effects of consuming a high protein&#xD;
      diet on fecal microbial communities, gastrointestinal function and symptoms, and general&#xD;
      wellness in older adults.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Older women will be randomized to a 18-week crossover study design. During each treatment&#xD;
      period participants will be provided with a weight maintenance diet providing approximately 2&#xD;
      g/kg/day of protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following a two-week baseline and in random order will have the following diets assigned:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be provided with a weight maintenance, high protein diet for two weeks,&#xD;
      then for two-weeks will resume their normal diet;&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will come back into clinic and for the next two weeks to receive a high&#xD;
      protein diet with a multi-strain probiotic for two weeks, then for two-weeks will resume&#xD;
      their normal diet;&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will come back into clinic and for the next two weeks will receive a high&#xD;
      protein diet with a prebiotic, then for two-weeks will resume their normal diet;&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will come back into clinic and for the next two weeks will receive a high&#xD;
      protein diet with the synbiotic combination. then for two-weeks will resume their normal diet&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants and researchers will be blinded for each treatment period (participants will&#xD;
      receive a probiotic or placebo capsule, and a prebiotic or placebo sachet).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following will be performed during the clinic visits: Questionnaires will assess quality&#xD;
      of life (QoL), wellness, gastrointestinal symptoms, bowel movement frequency, and compliance.&#xD;
      Hand-grip strength will be measured. Blood and urine samples will be collected at baseline&#xD;
      and at weeks 2, 6,10 and 14. Stool samples will be collected at baseline and at weeks 2, 4,&#xD;
      6, 8,10, 12, 14 and 16.&#xD;
