  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is for a study for patients that will be undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant&#xD;
      (HSCT). For HSCT, patients will need a double lumen central venous line (CVL). One of the&#xD;
      most common complications after an HSCT is Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD).Tacrolimus or&#xD;
      Cyclosporine along with methotrexate are used together in order to prevent GVHD. Normally&#xD;
      these medications are given via the white lumen and blood is drawn via the unexposed red&#xD;
      lumen to check the blood level of these medications. If these drugs are accidentally given&#xD;
      via the wrong lumen (line) it could cause blood levels to be falsely high. This error could&#xD;
      lead to the patient having to have peripheral blood draws that cause pain. The investigators&#xD;
      are proposing adding an ethanol lock to your lumens (lines) to see if this would help clean&#xD;
      the lines therefore preventing errors in blood tests and blood draws. An ethanol lock is a&#xD;
      70% alcohol which is injected into the CVL lumen and stays within the CVL as the CVL is&#xD;
      capped.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As cyclosporine and tacrolimus are both oil based medications and ethanol (70% alcohol) can&#xD;
      dissolve oil, the investigators hypothesize that an alcohol lock instilled into the lumen of&#xD;
      the CVL will be able to dissolve and leach out the oil based CNI adhering to the inside lumen&#xD;
      of the CVL catheter, thus decontaminating it. The safety of using ethanol via CVL is already&#xD;
      proven over the last many years. A study performed with neonates resulted in no adverse&#xD;
      effects when using ethanol locks, proving that their use is safe for the pediatric&#xD;
      population. Ethanol has been used as locks for disinfecting CVLs infected with a broad range&#xD;
      of microorganisms in pediatrics. It has also been useful in treating catheter occlusions&#xD;
      caused by Lipid formation. By placing a 70% ethanol lock for two hours in the contaminated&#xD;
      lumen, it has shown to degrade the biofilm and fat formation allowing for further use of the&#xD;
      CVL used 70 % ethanol locks and did not find any reductions in mechanical integrity of&#xD;
      polyetherurethane or silicone catheters exposed for as long as 10 weeks. Also, no structural&#xD;
      integrity complications have been found in the literature along with no evidence of systemic&#xD;
      toxicity with the use of ethanol locks. A retrospective study on PICU patients who had&#xD;
      received ethanol locks for 12-24 hours per lumen and a repeat lock when venous access was not&#xD;
      limited, flushed 0.2-1mls of ethanol through the catheter at the end of the dwell instead of&#xD;
      withdrawing the lock. Sixteen patients who received five daily ethanol lock treatments in&#xD;
      succession, had liver enzymes measured and only two patients had mildly elevated&#xD;
      transaminases, but these levels were not significant from their baseline levels. There were&#xD;
      also no reports from the nurses of any patient complaints or side effects. The study stated&#xD;
      that when larger volumes in which they classified as 2.3mls of ethanol are flushed through&#xD;
      the central line, patients have reported flushing, light-headedness, headache, nausea and&#xD;
      dyspnea. Only 2mls of ethanol will be administered in this study, and the ethanol lock will&#xD;
      be withdrawn prior to drawing the levels. Therefore, no side effects are expected.&#xD;
