  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of two treatment&#xD;
      strategies--delayed versus immediate surgery-- for children with primary spontaneous&#xD;
      pneumothorax (collapse of the lung). Currently, both treatment modalities are used and there&#xD;
      is no clear evidence that either option is superior. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      immediate surgery will have better outcomes with lower recurrence rates than delayed surgery.&#xD;

      1. All children presenting to Texas Children's Hospital with a primary spontaneous&#xD;
           pneumothorax will be potentially eligible for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. After the diagnosis has been made and initial medical therapy has been initiated, the&#xD;
           patients will be identified and parents or legal guardian approached by the staff&#xD;
           surgeon for consent to participate in the study. The attending pediatric surgeon or&#xD;
           surgical fellow will discuss the trial with all eligible patients and their families.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Written, informed consent will be obtained by the research nurse coordinator, a&#xD;
           pediatric surgical fellow, or an attending pediatric surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Once enrolled, the patients will be randomized to primary surgery: Video-Assisted&#xD;
           Thoracoscopic Surgery (VATS), blebectomy and mechanical pleurodesis, versus initial&#xD;
           nonoperative treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Prior to initiating the study, the randomization sequence will be computer-generated by&#xD;
           an independent statistician using a permuted block random allocation scheme with a block&#xD;
           size of 4,6. The randomization sequence will be maintained securely within the&#xD;
           randomization module in REDCap (Research electronic data capture), and it will be&#xD;
           accessed only after enrollment has occurred and inclusion criteria are verified by the&#xD;
           admitting staff surgeon. The participants and the surgeons will not be blinded to group&#xD;
           assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Primary Surgery Group. Patients randomized to the primary surgical intervention group&#xD;
           will undergo VATS, apical blebectomy and mechanical pleurodesis during the initial&#xD;
           hospital admission by the admitting staff surgeon. The general principles of the&#xD;
           surgical technique consist of a 3-port thoracoscopic approach, stapled blebectomy,&#xD;
           apical mechanical pleurodesis, and placement of chest tube . Variations of this&#xD;
           technique will be at the discretion of the surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Initial non-operative management group. Those randomized to the control group will be&#xD;
           admitted and their chest tube or percutaneous drainage catheter managed according to&#xD;
           standard protocol. This consists of a minimum of 48 hours of Pleur-Evac suction and&#xD;
           daily chest radiographs. The drainage tube is then placed to water seal when resolution&#xD;
           of the pneumothorax is documented by x-ray, as well as absence of an air leak. If there&#xD;
           are no clinical or radiographic changes after a water seal period, the chest tube is&#xD;
           then removed. A post-removal chest radiograph is obtained and the patient is discharged&#xD;
           if clinical and radiographic criteria are met. &quot;Rescue&quot; VATS/ blebectomy/pleurodesis&#xD;
           will be performed in those managed initially nonoperatively who meet criteria for&#xD;
           surgery thereafter (i.e. develop a persistent air leak after drainage tube placement). A&#xD;
           persistent air leak will be defined as bubbling of air in the Pleur-Evac water chamber&#xD;
           upon eliciting positive pressure lasting &gt;4 days, noted and documented in progress note&#xD;
           by attending physician. If recurrence is identified in the control group, it will be&#xD;
           managed operatively, as per current clinical practice, with VATS/&#xD;
           blebectomy/pleurodesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Discharge Criteria. Discharge criteria include being afebrile for 24 hours, normal&#xD;
           oxygen saturation with no oxygen requirement, benign physical exam, unchanged or&#xD;
           improved post-removal chest radiograph, ability to tolerate regular diet and ambulate,&#xD;
           and pain well controlled on oral pain medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Discharge Instructions. A discussion will take place between the surgical team and the&#xD;
           family prior to discharge in order to review standardized discharge instructions. These&#xD;
           will address an understanding by the patient and family of the signs and symptoms of&#xD;
           recurrent pneumothorax as well as specific follow up appointments and the scheduled&#xD;
           phone follow-up thereafter. For patients who have had primary surgery, specific&#xD;
           postoperative instructions will be given according to current clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Follow-up. Follow-up will be the same for both groups and will take place at 2-3 weeks&#xD;
           after hospital discharge (per standard of care), with subsequent telephone interviews at&#xD;
           3 months, 6 months and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. The primary outcome regarding effectiveness of primary VATS will be the overall&#xD;
           recurrence rate at 12 months. Secondary outcomes include surgical complication rate,&#xD;
           cumulative hospital length of stay (total number of hospital days during study period),&#xD;
           time to resumption of usual activities, and direct variable hospital costs. The&#xD;
           recurrence rate is defined as the proportion of patients with recurrent ipsilateral&#xD;
           pneumothorax during the follow-up period. Complications to be assessed include surgical&#xD;
           site infection, persistent air leak (&gt; 4 days), and prolonged need for chest tube (as&#xD;
           quantified by number of chest tube days). Standard National Surgical Quality Improvement&#xD;
           Program (NSQIP) definitions of these outcomes will be utilized. The time to resumption&#xD;
           of usual activities will be adjudicated at the time of the post-op follow up visit or by&#xD;
           means of a phone interview at 2-3 weeks postoperatively. The longest time period to&#xD;
           resumption all usual activities will be ascertained from patient questionnaires&#xD;
           addressing return to school date, level of pre- and post-illness activity, and daily&#xD;
           activity log kept by the patient or their parent. Post-operative quality of life will be&#xD;
           assessed at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months by telephone administration of The PedsQL&#xD;
           Measurement Model for the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory, a widely-used and&#xD;
           validated tool.&#xD;
