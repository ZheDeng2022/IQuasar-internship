      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of total bone marrow and lymphoid&#xD;
      irradiation when given together with chemotherapy before donor stem cell transplant in&#xD;
      treating patients with myelodysplastic syndrome or acute leukemia. Total marrow and lymphoid&#xD;
      irradiation is a type of radiation therapy that targets bone marrow and blood, where the&#xD;
      cancer is, instead of applying radiation to the whole body. Stem cell transplants use high&#xD;
      doses of chemotherapy and radiation therapy, such as total marrow and lymphoid irradiation,&#xD;
      to kill cancer cells, but these treatments kill normal cells as well. After chemotherapy,&#xD;
      healthy cells from a donor are given to the patient to help the patient grow new blood cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To establish safety and determine the maximum tolerated dose of total marrow and lymphoid&#xD;
      irradiation when given in combination with fludarabine (fludarabine phosphate) and&#xD;
      pre-post-transplant cyclophosphamide, as conditioning for haploidentical hematopoietic cell&#xD;
      transplantation (HCT) in patients with high-risk acute lymphocytic or myelogenous leukemia or&#xD;
      intermediate/high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the safety of the regimen at each dose level by assessing adverse events:&#xD;
      type, frequency, severity, attribution, time course, duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the safety of the regimen at each dose level by assessing complications:&#xD;
      including acute/chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), infection and delayed engraftment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), cumulative incidence&#xD;
      (CI) of relapse/progression, and non-relapse mortality (NRM) at +100 Days, 1 year and 2&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To characterize minimal residual disease from bone marrow aspirates on Days +30, +100,&#xD;
      +180 post-transplant and describe in relation to total marrow and lymphoid irradiation (TMLI)&#xD;
      dose level and patient disease status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To describe the kinetics of immune cell recovery in the first year post-transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of TMLI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONDITIONING: Patients undergo TMLI twice daily (BID) on days -7 to -4 or -3 (depending on&#xD;
      the dose level). Patients also receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) on days -7 to&#xD;
      -3 and cyclophosphamide IV on days -7, -6, 3, and 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRANSPLANT: Patients undergo bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplant on day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GHVD PROPHYLAXIS: Patients receive tacrolimus* IV once daily (QD) or orally (PO) BID on days&#xD;
      5-180. Patients also receive mycophenolate mofetil PO thrice daily (TID) or IV on days 5-35.&#xD;
      Treatment with tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil may continue in the presence of active&#xD;
      GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *NOTE: Patients intolerant of tacrolimus may receive cyclosporine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up twice weekly for 100 days,&#xD;
      twice monthly until 6 months, monthly until the patient is off immunosuppressive therapy&#xD;
      without evidence of GVHD, and then at least yearly for a total of 5 years.&#xD;

             oral methotrexate, vincristine, oral etoposide, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors [TKIs];&#xD;
             FLT-3 inhibitors such as sorafenib, crenolanib, quizartinib, midostaurin can also be&#xD;
             given up to 3 days before conditioning regimen)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The recipient has a medical problem or neurologic/psychiatric dysfunction which would&#xD;
             impair his/her ability to be compliant with the medical regimen and to tolerate&#xD;
             transplantation or would prolong hematologic recovery which in the opinion of the&#xD;
             principal investigator would place the recipient at unacceptable risk&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not have had a prior autologous or allogeneic transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HLA-matched or partially matched (7/8 or 8/8) related or unrelated donor is available&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients treatment history may not include anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody therapy&#xD;
             (e.g., SGN-CD33 or Mylotarg)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects, who in the opinion of the investigator, may not be able to comply with the&#xD;

          -  DONOR: Evidence of active infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  DONOR: Medical or physical reason which makes the donor unlikely to tolerate or&#xD;
             cooperate with growth factor therapy and leukapheresis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  DONOR: Factors which place the donor at increased risk for complications from&#xD;
             leukapheresis or granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) therapy&#xD;
