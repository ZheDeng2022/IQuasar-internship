      To assess the effect of PEX168 doses on the pharmacokinetics of simvastatin(as determined by&#xD;
      simvastation acid) in healthy subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was an open-label, sequential, single-center study that evaluated the pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      of simvastatin when coadministered with PEX168 in healthy adult subjects. The total duration&#xD;
      of each subject's participation in the study was approximately 10 weeks, which included up to&#xD;
      a 14-day Screening Period, a 34-day Treatment Period, and an approximately 4-week Follow-up&#xD;
      Period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Center: This study was conducted at a single site in Shanghai Mental Health Center (SMHC)of&#xD;
      China Treatment.All subjects receives a single 40-mg oral dose of simvastatin on Day 1&#xD;
      followed by 5 weekly 200μg doses of PEX168 injected subcutaneously beginning on Day 3 and a&#xD;
      second single 40-mg oral dose of simvastatin on Day 33.&#xD;
