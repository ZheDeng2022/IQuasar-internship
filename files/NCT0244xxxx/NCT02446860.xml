  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is diagnosed in around 8500 patients annually in the UK.&#xD;
      Approximately one third of these patients present with metastatic disease where the RCC has&#xD;
      spread to other organs. The mainstay of treatment for these patients is systemic drug&#xD;
      therapy, but surgery to remove the primary kidney tumour (i.e. nephrectomy) may also provide&#xD;
      clinical benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no standard preoperative systemic drug therapy in metastatic RCC, but such&#xD;
      preoperative therapy is used widely in the treatment of other cancer types. This approach has&#xD;
      several potential advantages including shrinking the tumour to help improve surgical outcomes&#xD;
      and to aid identification of appropriate postoperative Drug therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the last 10 years several agents have demonstrated promising activity in RCC including&#xD;
      the monoclonal antibody therapy nivolumab. This novel immunotherapy works by blocking an&#xD;
      immune cell receptor (programmed death1(PD1)) which the cancer can otherwise utilise to evade&#xD;
      an individuals immune system attack. This study will investigate the use of nivolumab therapy&#xD;
      as a preoperative treatment in patients with metastatic RCC for whom nephrectomy is planned.&#xD;
      A total of 19 patients will be recruited at the Royal Marsden Hospital Patients will be&#xD;
      treated with nivolumab for 8 weeks prior to surgery, after which nivolumab therapy will&#xD;
      restart and continue until such time that the patient is not receiving an overall clinical&#xD;
      benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the study will be to assess the safety of such a strategy, with further&#xD;
      aims to assess clinical effectiveness. This is also a unique opportunity to further&#xD;
      investigate the way in which nivolumab works and to identify predictors of treatment&#xD;
      response. To achieve this patients will be asked to provide biopsy samples of their RCC pre &amp;&#xD;
      post nivolumab treatment and their nephrectomy tissue for research use, alongside additional&#xD;
      blood &amp; urine samples.&#xD;
