  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Volitinib is a potent and selective small molecule c-Met kinase inhibitor. Volitinib was&#xD;
      found to inhibit c-Met kinase at the enzyme and cell levels with IC50s of 4 nM for both&#xD;
      enzyme and Met phosphorylation in the cell. Consistent with its potent enzyme and cell&#xD;
      activity, volitinib was found to inhibit cell growth in vitro against tumors with c-Met gene&#xD;
      amplification in the absence of HGF stimulation with IC50s generally below 10 nM. It also&#xD;
      potently inhibited HGF-stimulated cell proliferation against tumors with c-Met overexpression&#xD;
      or carrying a HGF/c-Met autocrine loop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a xenograft model Hs746T with c-Met gene amplification, suboptimal doses 0.6 mg/kg&#xD;
      volitinib and 3 mg/kg docetaxel induced TGI(expand) of 55.8% and 80.8%, respectively, whereas&#xD;
      combination resulted in a TGI by 101.1%, and statistical significance was seen between&#xD;
      combination group and either of mono-therapy group. Plasma exposures of volitinib and&#xD;
      docetaxel were determined after last dose at the end of study, and there was no significant&#xD;
      difference between combination and single agent on exposures of either volitinib or&#xD;
      docetaxel. More importantly, combination was well tolerant and no body weight loss was found&#xD;
      in the animals. These results suggested that it would be worthwhile to study the combination&#xD;
      use of volitinib and docetaxel in clinic.&#xD;
