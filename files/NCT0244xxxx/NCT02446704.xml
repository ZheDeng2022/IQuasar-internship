  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase I/II clinical trial, which has two parts. The participant will&#xD;
      be asked to participate in one part of the study. The first part tests the safety of the&#xD;
      combination of drugs and tries to define the appropriate dose to use for future studies. The&#xD;
      second part tests whether the combination of drugs is effective in treating small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the combination of drugs is being studied. It also means&#xD;
      that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved the combination of drugs&#xD;
      for Small Cell Lung Cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Olaparib (Lynparza) is FDA approved for the treatment of a type of ovarian cancer associated&#xD;
      with a particular DNA change. Olaparib works by blocking the activity of a protein called&#xD;
      poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) which is involved in DNA repair. Cancer cells rely on&#xD;
      PARP to repair their DNA and enable them to continue dividing. Olaparib has been used in&#xD;
      research studies with other cancers. Information from those other research studies suggests&#xD;
      that this drug may help to treat patients with small cell lung cancer. While it is not&#xD;
      approved by the FDA for small cell lung cancer, it is considered part of standard treatment&#xD;
      for other cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Temozolomide (Temodar) is approved by the FDA for the treatment of a type of brain tumor,&#xD;
      glioblastoma. It has been studied in small cell lung cancer in previous research studies.&#xD;
      While it is not approved by the FDA for small cell lung cancer, it is considered part of&#xD;
      standard treatment for relapsed disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are looking for the maximum tolerated dose or MTD&#xD;
      of the combination of olaparib and temozolomide that can be given safely. The investigators&#xD;
      will also begin to collect information about the effects of the combination on small cell&#xD;
      lung cancer&#xD;
