  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Santa Clara County has partnered with Abode Services to provide 112 units of permanent&#xD;
      supportive housing (PSH) for up to 6 years for chronically homeless individuals with multiple&#xD;
      co-morbidities who are high cost users of services in the County. Because the target&#xD;
      population of high cost users who are chronically homeless greatly exceeds the supply of&#xD;
      permanent supportive housing to be made available via this mechanism, the County plans to use&#xD;
      this opportunity to examine the effectiveness of PSH compared to treatment as usual by&#xD;
      ethically allocating a limited resource using a lottery type system for eligible individuals&#xD;
      who consent to participate in the Pay For Success (PFS) initiative. Specifically, while there&#xD;
      are estimated to be over 2,500 people in Santa Clara who would be eligible for participation&#xD;
      on any given night, the PFS program will only provide 112 PSH units at any given time. As the&#xD;
      study duration will last six years, the investigators anticipate that approximately 150-200&#xD;
      people will be housed via this mechanism. Outcomes will be reported to the Institutional&#xD;
      Review Board (IRB) on a quarterly basis and will be based on scheduled quarterly reports&#xD;
      provided to the county.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This evaluation will be a randomized controlled trial comparing the outcomes for chronically&#xD;
      homeless individuals randomized to receive PSH to those who are randomized to receive usual&#xD;
      care. The aims of this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. measure months of stable tenancy for individuals who are placed in PSH;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. examine differences in utilization of health services and the criminal justice system;&#xD;
           and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. monitor the changes in use of longitudinal care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data utilized for this evaluation will be County administrative data. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that some costly and acute health services utilization will decrease over time&#xD;
      for the intervention group, while other more sustaining health services will increase.&#xD;

      Recruitment: Screening Tool&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible homeless individuals will be identified using a Screening Tool developed by the&#xD;
      University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) evaluators that uses County administrative&#xD;
      data to identify the most costly users of health and social services in the County based on&#xD;
      their medical and behavioral health conditions, length of homelessness, and County services&#xD;
      utilization history (&quot;Eligible Homeless Individuals&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abode Services (Abode) is the housing service provider selected by the County for this PFS&#xD;
      project. Abode will obtain 112 units of permanent supportive housing over the course of the&#xD;
      first year of this study and place referred clients into those units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility Confirmation/Assessment/Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals identified by the Screening Tool who have been located by the Study Team will&#xD;
      have their eligibility confirmed through administrative data and be screened in-person to&#xD;
      determine key inclusion and exclusion criteria. Following eligibility confirmation, a&#xD;
      designated Study Team member who has been trained in the process of informed consent will ask&#xD;
      the individual if he/she is interested in learning about the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The explanation of the study prior to administration of informed consent will be standardized&#xD;
      so that all potentially eligible participants are approached in the same manner and receive&#xD;
      the same information about the study prior to undergoing informed consent. This process will&#xD;
      be conducted in the potential participants' language of choice. The investigators anticipate&#xD;
      that the most common language choice for those with limited English proficiency is Spanish&#xD;
      and Vietnamese. Study Team members will be fluent in those languages, as well as provide&#xD;
      consent forms in those languages. For languages other than Spanish and Vietnamese, the&#xD;
      investigators will use trained medical interpreters, who will interpret the consent process&#xD;
      and attest to their interpretation on the consent form. The Study Team will use the &quot;teach&#xD;
      back&quot; method to ensure comprehension of the study goals and risks as part of their informed&#xD;
      consent procedure. Any individual who is unable to give informed consent, as expressed by&#xD;
      inability to repeat back the risks and benefits of the study after three successive teach&#xD;
      backs, will be deemed ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon granting informed consent, eligible participants will be randomized to either the&#xD;
      intervention or control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RCT &quot;Intervention&quot; and &quot;Usual Care&quot; Groups: Intervention Group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals randomized to the intervention group will be referred to Abode Services for the&#xD;
      opportunity to be placed in permanent supportive housing. Specifically, Abode will provide&#xD;
      individuals with access to a housing unit, along with a broad array of services designed to&#xD;
      achieve sustained residential stability and wellness. These services are designed to end the&#xD;
      participants' homelessness, increase income (primarily through enrollment in Supplemental&#xD;
      Security Income), and provide increased access to ongoing physical and behavioral health&#xD;
      services. Abode will use a modified Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) team model of service&#xD;
      delivery. Abode's modified ACT model will provide community-based clinical services,&#xD;
      integrated with a flexible array of housing options delivered through a Housing First&#xD;
      approach to provide housing and supportive services for the most vulnerable members of the&#xD;
      chronically homeless population who most frequently use costly emergency services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the PSH service model and Abode's overall service delivery approach, Abode will&#xD;
      offer a range of supportive services to participants, including, but not limited to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Permanent/Temporary Supportive Housing placement and retention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specialty mental health services&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Substance abuse services&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medication support and education&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Social and community living skills&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Case management / housing skills&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Educational / vocational support&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Money management&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Leisure / Spiritual opportunities&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Connection to primary care providers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Management of complex health issues&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daily living skills&#xD;
&#xD;
      RCT &quot;Intervention&quot; and &quot;Usual Care&quot; Groups: Usual Care Group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronically homeless individuals who are in the control group will have access to all&#xD;
      existing safety-net services that are available to homeless individuals in the County. In&#xD;
      addition, since chronically homeless individuals often have complex conditions that make them&#xD;
      high users of safety-net services, chronically homeless individuals who are not in the&#xD;
      treatment group may be eligible for the array of other programs that are designed for high&#xD;
      users of specific systems. These programs include Full Service Partnerships for individuals&#xD;
      with a serious mental illness including those who are involved in the criminal justice&#xD;
      system, and the upcoming Acute Mental Health Pay of Success project. Finally, members of the&#xD;
      control group will also have access to other all other permanent supportive housing programs&#xD;
      for chronically homeless persons in the County.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment and Randomization Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment will occur in &quot;batches&quot; in order to provide Abode with sufficient participants to&#xD;
      fill the units at a pace that will maximize both occupancy of available units and efficient&#xD;
      use of Abode resources. The number of eligible individuals who are ultimately randomized and&#xD;
      the pace of randomization will be based on&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The number of available housing units to which Abode has access over a given time&#xD;
           period, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The number of individuals to whom Abode will need to outreach in order to enroll enough&#xD;
           participants to fill those units. This number will be based on a referral plan agreed&#xD;
           upon by Abode and the County.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each time new housing units become available, the County will enable the screening tool to be&#xD;
      applied to a batch of incoming individuals. Potentially eligible homeless individuals whom&#xD;
      have not been enrolled in the study will be offered study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals randomized to the treatment group who are referred to and then located by the&#xD;
      housing provider will be offered enrollment in the permanent supportive housing (PSH)&#xD;
      intervention program. If an individual agrees to enroll in the PSH intervention, the&#xD;
      individual will begin to receive case management services from the housing provider&#xD;
      immediately, even if a housing unit is not yet available, and will be offered a housing unit&#xD;
      once it becomes available. The intervention group will continue to receive case management&#xD;
      services throughout the study, whether or not the individuals remain housed successfully.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collected&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals will be identified using data from multiple data sets that track health and&#xD;
      criminal justice system use within Santa Clara County. UCSF will receive identifiable data&#xD;
      from the following data sources from the County based on the provisions of the data-sharing&#xD;
      Memorandum Of Understanding (MOU) that exists between UCSF and Santa Clara County. If the&#xD;
      data are not linked by the County, UCSF will link the data using the participants' unique&#xD;
      county identifier. UCSF will discard these identifiers once data are linked for the purpose&#xD;
      of the analysis, and will retain only the unique study identifier (ID). The unique study ID&#xD;
      can only be linked back to participating individuals' names via a master document that links&#xD;
      name to study ID, which will be kept under password protection by the evaluators and will&#xD;
      only be available to participating study staff. This master document will be destroyed at the&#xD;
      conclusion of the study period or after a pre-determined period of time put forth by the IRB&#xD;
      after the study's conclusion. The main anticipated data sources are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Santa Clara Valley Health and Hospital System, including Santa Clara Valley Medical&#xD;
           Center (HealthLink)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Homeless Management Information System (HMIS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Criminal Justice Information Control (CJIC)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tenancy in permanent supportive housing will be reported by the housing service provider and&#xD;
      verified by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis Plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the randomized controlled trial (RCT) framework used to evaluate health utilization&#xD;
      outcomes, the study team will use an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, in which all&#xD;
      participants randomly assigned to one of the groups are analyzed together, regardless of&#xD;
      whether or not the participants completed or received that treatment. In this case,&#xD;
      participants who are randomized to the permanent supportive housing intervention will be&#xD;
      retained in the treatment group even if the participants are not able to be located, if the&#xD;
      participants are located but never enter housing, or are located, enrolled, and enter&#xD;
      housing, but are not retained in housing long-term. Participants randomized to the control&#xD;
      group will be followed administratively using data provided by the County in order to track&#xD;
      the outcomes outlined above in comparison to those in the intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomization will be evaluated by comparing the characteristics (e.g., demographics,&#xD;
      chronic health conditions) of the intervention and control groups using chi-square and&#xD;
      non-parametric tests. The associations of baseline characteristics, medical conditions, and&#xD;
      social factors with stable tenancy will be evaluated using logistic or Cox regression&#xD;
      analyses. The health services use outcomes (i.e., emergency department and hospital services,&#xD;
      social services and criminal justice system utilization) and their associations with stable&#xD;
      tenancy will be evaluated using logistic, ordinal, or linear regression, as appropriate.&#xD;
      Comparisons of rates of service utilization will be performed at α = 0.95 with one-tailed&#xD;
      tests of the outcomes in direction hypothesized (e.g., emergency department (ED) visits in&#xD;
      the treatment group will be ≤ ED visits in the control group). However, the investigators&#xD;
      will also test for trends over time, since it may be likely that health services utilization&#xD;
      increases in the treatment group in the short term as services are more readily available and&#xD;
      participants are more accessible, and then decreases in the longer term as the participant's&#xD;
      health improves and stabilizes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPANS&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to account for a larger amount of the data the investigators have collected for&#xD;
      individuals enrolled in the evaluation, the investigators grouped data into one-year spans of&#xD;
      time for each individual in the treatment and control group. For example, if an individual&#xD;
      was enrolled for 4 years, the individual would have four separate one-year spans in the&#xD;
      regression analysis. The use of spans allows the investigators to include the most available&#xD;
      data for each individual in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For participants who had potential spans that lasted ≥ 6 but &lt;12 months, the investigators&#xD;
      prorated utilization counts to a one year. To account for outliers in the data, the&#xD;
      investigators top coded all span-level counts to the 99th percentile. The investigators&#xD;
      included indicators in the regression analysis to signify the year in the program in order to&#xD;
      account for patterns of use that may decrease or increase over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators censored spans at the time of death. To account for the possibility that&#xD;
      participants moved out of County, the investigators censored data 6 months after the last&#xD;
      point of contact. For example, if the last time an individual used any services measured in&#xD;
      our study was January 1, 2017, the investigators censored their data after June 30, 2017, and&#xD;
      constructed spans with the data that remained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators used negative binomial regression analysis on count data outcomes using an&#xD;
      intent-to- treat framework where treatment status was based on assignment to the treatment&#xD;
      group. The investigators present results as incident rate ratios. The investigators clustered&#xD;
      standard errors at the individual level to account for individuals with multiple spans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In sensitivity analyses, the investigators recoded outcome variables to a binary indicator&#xD;
      for whether an individual used any of a given service within the one-year span. The&#xD;
      investigators explored sensitivity to alternative modeling choices such as ordinary least&#xD;
      squares and present sensitivity analyses. The investigators also explored allowing the&#xD;
      treatment effect to vary by how long the individual was enrolled in the program by including&#xD;
      interaction terms for treatment status and year indicators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY LOCAL AVERAGE TREATMENT EFFECT (LATE) ESTIMATE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators also present negative binomial (count model) regression that include a&#xD;
      treatment indicator and controls for time &quot;spans,&quot; as noted above, as well as an exploratory&#xD;
      analysis using linear regression models that incorporate instrumental variables to estimate&#xD;
      the local average treatment effect (LATE) by using assignment to the treatment group as an&#xD;
      instrument for housing. LATE represents the effect of treatment on those induced to take up&#xD;
      housing because of assignment to treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on program data and housing data from Santa Clara County, 85% of those assigned to the&#xD;
      treatment group were ever housed as compared to 37% in the control group. The LATE estimates&#xD;
      represent the causal effect of treatment on the roughly 50% of the treatment group that was&#xD;
      housed because of the intervention. This type of model effectively scales the impact of being&#xD;
      in the treatment group by accounting for how assignment to the treatment group is correlated&#xD;
      with take-up of housing. It is not attenuated by imperfect take-up of housing in the&#xD;
      treatment group and by the fact that there is &quot;contamination&quot; of the control group whereby&#xD;
      some individuals find housing despite being assigned to the usual care group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are also working on two additional sets of analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact of housing on those who received it: Because of our ITT evaluation framework, the&#xD;
      impact of housing on individuals who receive it may be diluted. The investigators are working&#xD;
      with the County on two additional data elements to examine this in more depth. First, the&#xD;
      investigators are working to obtain complete data from the County regarding housing&#xD;
      placements among individuals randomized to the control group and for individuals randomized&#xD;
      to the intervention group who were never housed by Abode. These data are currently being&#xD;
      reviewed for completeness and quality. Assuming the data are valid, the investigators will&#xD;
      estimate the average treatment effect on the treated using instrumental variables regression&#xD;
      to better account for the impact of the Abode PSH &quot;treatment&quot; on those who actually received&#xD;
      it. The average treatment effect on the treated (ATET) estimate takes into account the fact&#xD;
      that adherence with treatment assignment was not perfect, i.e. some assigned to housing were&#xD;
      not housed and some assigned to the control group were housed. The investigators will also&#xD;
      report descriptive statistics on housing entry and exit dates, and the number of moves for&#xD;
      each group as a measure of housing stability that can be examined for both treatment and&#xD;
      control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant deaths: Individuals enrolled in Project Welcome Home had higher rates of death&#xD;
      than the investigators anticipated. To explore this further, the investigators have obtained&#xD;
      death certificates from the County for all individuals enrolled in the study who have died.&#xD;
      The investigators have begun to review these data and to categorize reasons for deaths. Once&#xD;
      the investigators receive and validate the housing data outlined above, the investigators&#xD;
      will examine the temporal relationship between death and housing. The investigators also plan&#xD;
      to examine utilization after enrollment and up to the time of death to uncover possible&#xD;
      predictors for death and to better understand why the death rate in this population is higher&#xD;
      than expected.&#xD;
