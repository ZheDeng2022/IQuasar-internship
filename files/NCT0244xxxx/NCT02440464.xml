  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to compare progression-free survival (PFS) from randomization among&#xD;
      patients randomized on the BMT CTN 1302 protocol, &quot;Multicenter Phase II, Double-blind Placebo&#xD;
      Controlled Trial of Maintenance Ixazomib after Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell&#xD;
      Transplantation for High Risk Multiple Myeloma&quot;. It is hypothesized that Ixazomib maintenance&#xD;
      therapy will result in improved PFS in patients with high-risk multiple myeloma following&#xD;
      Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) compared to placebo.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as a Phase II, multi-center double-blind trial that randomizes patients&#xD;
      with high risk Multiple Myeloma to Ixazomib maintenance or placebo 60-120 days after&#xD;
      allogeneic HSCT. The primary objective of this randomized trial is to compare progression&#xD;
      free survival from randomization as a time to event endpoint between patients randomized to&#xD;
      Ixazomib maintenance or placebo. Secondary objectives are to describe for each treatment arm:&#xD;
      rates of grade II-IV and III-IV Graft-Versus-Host-Disease (GVHD), chronic GVHD, best disease&#xD;
      response rates, disease progression, transplant related mortality, overall survival, rates of&#xD;
      Grade ≥ 3 toxicity according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)&#xD;
      Version 4.0, incidence of infections, and health-related quality of life.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must meet one of the following disease criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             a. Patients with high risk multiple myeloma in partial response (PR) or better with no&#xD;
             prior progression and are ≤ 24.0 months after autologous HCT (single or planned&#xD;
             tandem), or are ≤ 24.0 months after initiation of systemic anti-myeloma therapy for&#xD;
             patients without prior autologous HCT; or&#xD;
&#xD;
             i. High risk is defined by the presence of any one of the following detected at any&#xD;
             time prior to enrollment: deletion of chromosome 13 by conventional cytogenetics,&#xD;
             hypodiploidy, abnormality in chromosome 1(1q amplification or 1p deletion), t(4;14),&#xD;
             t(14;16), t(14;20) or deletion of 17p by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or&#xD;
             conventional karyotyping; high risk criteria based on commercially available gene&#xD;
             expression profiling (GEP)&#xD;
&#xD;
             b. Patients with high risk multiple myeloma (see criterion 2.a.i. above) in very good&#xD;
             partial response (VGPR) or better with 1 prior progression which occurred ≤ 24.0&#xD;
             months after autologous HCT (single or planned tandem), or ≤ 24.0 months after&#xD;
             initiation of systemic anti-myeloma therapy for patients without prior autologous HCT;&#xD;
             or&#xD;
&#xD;
             i. Patients with one prior progression without measurable monoclonal paraprotein at&#xD;
             the time of disease progression or relapse (&lt; 1.0 g/dl in serum or &lt; 200 mg/24hrs in&#xD;
             urine) may be considered to have met VGPR criteria if &lt; 5% plasma cells in bone marrow&#xD;
             and ≥ 90% decrease in the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels from&#xD;
             baseline (time of progression/relapse).&#xD;
&#xD;
             ii. In patients with IgG kappa MM receiving daratumumab: International Myeloma Working&#xD;
             Group criteria for VGPR may not be achieved since daratumumab is known to increase the&#xD;
             IgG kappa spike. In such cases the FLC and marrow may be used to establish VGPR, as&#xD;
             above, with prior approval from the protocol co-chairs.&#xD;
&#xD;
             c. Patients with standard risk multiple myeloma in VGPR or better (see criteria 2.b.i.&#xD;
             and 2.b.ii. above) at the time of enrollment with 1 prior progression ≤ 24.0 months&#xD;
             from single or planned tandem autologous HCT; or d. Patients with primary plasma cell&#xD;
             leukemia in VGPR or better with no prior disease progression and are ≤ 18.0 months&#xD;
             after autologous HCT, or are ≤ 18.0 months after initiation of anti-myeloma therapy&#xD;
             without prior autologous HCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must have a related or unrelated peripheral blood stem cell donor that meet&#xD;
             one of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. A sibling donor who is a 6/6 match at HLA-A and -B (intermediate or higher&#xD;
                  resolution) and -DRB1 (at high resolution using DNA-based typing) and must be&#xD;
                  willing to donate peripheral blood stem cells and meet institutional criteria for&#xD;
                  donation OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. A related donor (other than sibling) who is a 8/8 match for HLA-A, -B, -C (at&#xD;
                  intermediate or higher resolution) and -DRB1 (at high resolution using DNA-based&#xD;
                  typing) and must be willing to donate peripheral blood stem cells and meet&#xD;
                  institutional criteria for donation OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. An unrelated donor who is an 8/8 match at HLA-A, -B, -C, and -DRB1 (at high&#xD;
                  resolution using DNA-based typing) and must be willing to donate peripheral blood&#xD;
                  stem cells and meet institutional criteria for donation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Cardiac function: Ejection fraction &gt; 40%&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Estimated creatinine clearance greater than 40 mL/minute (using the Cockcroft-Gault&#xD;
             formula and actual body weight)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Pulmonary function: Diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) ≥ 40%&#xD;
             (adjusted for hemoglobin) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) ≥ 50%&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Liver function: total bilirubin &lt; 2x the upper limit of normal and alanine&#xD;
             aminotransferase (ALT)/aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &lt; 2.5x the upper normal limit&#xD;
             (Patients with Gilbert's Disease are permitted to exceed the defined bilirubin value&#xD;
             of 2x the upper limit of normal, however measurements of direct bilirubin should be&#xD;
             done to confirm this diagnosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Female subjects (unless postmenopausal for at least 1 year before the screening visit,&#xD;
             or surgically sterilized), agree to practice two (2) effective methods of&#xD;
             contraception at the same time, or agree to practice true abstinence when this is in&#xD;
             line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject (Periodic abstinence [eg,&#xD;
             calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods] and withdrawal are not&#xD;
             acceptable methods of contraception) through 90 days after the last dose of&#xD;
             maintenance therapy (see Section 2.6.2 for definition of postmenopausal).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Male subjects (even if surgically sterilized) must agree to one of the following:&#xD;
             practice effective barrier contraception (see Section 2.6.4.1 for list of barrier&#xD;
             methods), or practice true abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and&#xD;
             usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence [eg, calendar, ovulation,&#xD;
             symptothermal, post-ovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
             from the time of signing the informed consent through 90 days after last dose of&#xD;
             maintenance therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Voluntary written consent must be given before performance of any study related&#xD;
             procedure not part of standard medical care, with the understanding that consent may&#xD;
             be withdrawn by the patient at any time without prejudice to future medical care.&#xD;
