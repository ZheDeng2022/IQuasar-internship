      Early nursing nutrition intervention for outpatients in need of surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective - To investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of screening and an early&#xD;
           nursing intervention on malnutrition in outpatients in need for surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Design - Multi-centre cluster-randomised controlled early trial design (n=150 patients)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention - Malnutrition screening (during outpatient clinic visit) and (in case of&#xD;
           patients being ´at risk for malnutrition´ or being ´malnourished´), a nutrition care&#xD;
           plan (including nutritional drinks and energy and protein rich meals) tailored to&#xD;
           individual patient requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison - Usual care (no nutritional care plan)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Early screening and treatment of malnutrition is vital. The prevalence of malnutrition at&#xD;
      hospital admission has only slightly decreased over the last few years. (Halfens, 2007) This&#xD;
      indicates that screening and intervention early in the course of developing disease, e.g. at&#xD;
      the outpatient clinic, can prevent severe malnutrition and decrease the amount and complexity&#xD;
      of care. (Jonkers-Schuitema et al., 2011; Leistra et al., 2009). Screening for malnutrition&#xD;
      and nutrition interventions at the outpatient clinic however, is no daily practice. Leistra&#xD;
      et al. (2009) showed that only 17% of the severely undernourished patients and 4% of the&#xD;
      moderately undernourished patients received some form of dietetic treatment at the outpatient&#xD;
      clinic. Early nursing nutrition interventions have not been studies well before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of screening and an early nursing&#xD;
      intervention on malnutrition in outpatients in need for surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Multicentre cluster randomized controlled trial design in surgical outpatient clinics&#xD;
      in two hospitals (one academic and one non-academic). The intervention is randomly assigned&#xD;
      to half of the outpatient clinics, and patients clustered with these nurses, working at the&#xD;
      outpatient clinics. The remaining nurses and their patients will serve as a control group.&#xD;
      Nursing teams with nurses working in multiple teams will be excluded. Nurses will be trained&#xD;
      in the use of the MUST-Screening and nutrition care plans. Study population: Patients&#xD;
      visiting the outpatient clinic, planned for operation, of one academic and one non-academic&#xD;
      hospital (n=150).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the intervention: The early nursing nutrition intervention will include&#xD;
      malnutrition screening (during outpatient clinic visit) with the MUST. If patients in the&#xD;
      intervention group are being ´at risk for malnutrition´ or being ´malnourished´, a&#xD;
      standardised nutrition care plan (including nutritional drinks and energy and protein rich&#xD;
      meals, tailored to individual patient requirements) will be discussed with the patient by&#xD;
      nurses. Control patients will receive usual care (no nutrition care plan). The intervention&#xD;
      period will be 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome: Primary: Up to 6 months, BMI will be measured at three point in time: 1) at the&#xD;
      outpatient clinic, 2) at hospitalisation, and 3) at discharge. Also, intake of nutrients will&#xD;
      be measured for 2 days after the outpatient clinic visit. Average time frame for each patient&#xD;
      is 5 weeks, for both intervention and control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary: Up to 6 months, Length of Stay (LOS) and health-related quality of life (EQ-5D)&#xD;
      will be measured at discharge, and CQ satisfaction with nutritional care &amp; care in general&#xD;
      will be measured at the outpatient clinic and at hospitalisation. Average time frame for each&#xD;
      patient is 5 weeks, for both intervention and control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate costs of the intervention, nurses time investment with patients at risk will be&#xD;
      observed in 30 patients per group and combined with average costs to arrive at a preliminary&#xD;
      cost of usual care and the early nutrition intervention. To evaluate the process, nurses will&#xD;
      be interviewed (n=6) to collect data on the manner in which the intervention changes the&#xD;
      nursing care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: Data will be analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. Results are&#xD;
      clustered at ward level. In this study with the same subjects at baseline and follow-up, we&#xD;
      will therefore use a linear mixed model for repeated measurements, with ''nurse'' as random&#xD;
      effect, BMI as main outcome, and group, time and the group x time interaction as fixed&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;

    <description>To evaluate costs of the intervention, the reach and delivery data collected for the purpose of process evaluation will be used, and combined with cost estimates for both the intervention and usual care, from the perspective of direct healthcare costs. In the analysis the outcomes of the intervention and care as usual (specific and generic outcomes) will be matched with the costs of implementation, costs of nursing care performed (in euros per hour, observed in 30 patients per group) and costs of training and materials. In this way a first exploration of cost effectiveness will be available.</description>
