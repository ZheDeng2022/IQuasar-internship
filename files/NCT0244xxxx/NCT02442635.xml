  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposal aims to expand non-pharmacologic options for the control of symptoms during&#xD;
      chemotherapy using yoga practices. It is particularly focused on sleep disturbance with a&#xD;
      secondary focus on fatigue.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sleep disturbance is among the most common symptoms experienced by cancer patients, occurs in&#xD;
      up to 80% of patients during chemotherapy, and results in serious impairments in quality of&#xD;
      life. Although pharmacologic therapies improve sleep disturbance, they have numerous side&#xD;
      effects, problems with tolerance and dependence, and are not well studied in oncology&#xD;
      patients. While non-pharmacologic therapies may decrease sleep disturbance, the current level&#xD;
      of evidence on their efficacy is insufficient. Fatigue occurs in up to 95% of those receiving&#xD;
      chemotherapy, and results in major impairments in functioning and quality of life. Despite&#xD;
      its significance, few effective treatments currently exist for fatigue. Prior studies suggest&#xD;
      that yoga may be helpful for sleep disturbance and fatigue, but these studies have&#xD;
      limitations. An important challenge in yoga research is that it is typically a multi-modality&#xD;
      practice that can include physical postures, breathing practices, and/or meditation&#xD;
      components. Prior studies have not adequately addressed the effects of individual components.&#xD;
      Therefore, key questions remain unanswered about the most effective elements of yoga; how to&#xD;
      best combine them for particular problems such as chemotherapy symptoms; and optimal dosing.&#xD;
      The current study will address these gaps in the literature and perform key developmental&#xD;
      steps to prepare for a large randomized, controlled trial (RCT). It builds on preliminary&#xD;
      work in which yoga breathing practices during chemotherapy were found to improve sleep&#xD;
      disturbance, showed trends toward improvements in fatigue, and were feasible to implement in&#xD;
      patients undergoing chemotherapy. Using a mixed-methods approach to evaluate each&#xD;
      intervention component, the investigators will pursue three closely interlinked steps in&#xD;
      cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. In Aim 1 (n=10), the investigators will manualize an&#xD;
      individualized approach to the yoga breathing intervention and iteratively refine it to&#xD;
      insure feasibility and acceptability. In Aim 2 (n=20), the investigators will manualize a&#xD;
      yoga posture intervention, evaluating both restorative/static poses and flowing poses, and&#xD;
      perform iterative refinement to test feasibility and acceptability. In Aim 3 (n=70), the&#xD;
      investigators will assess the final multi-modality yoga intervention to select final&#xD;
      intervention elements and delivery methods for testing in a planned future RCT. This proposal&#xD;
      will help to improve the treatment of debilitating cancer associated symptoms and advance&#xD;
      approaches to developing therapeutic yoga intervention trials.&#xD;
