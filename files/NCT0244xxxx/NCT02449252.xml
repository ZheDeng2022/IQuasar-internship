      Radiotherapy (RT) is an important option for patients with limited stage FL. The recommended&#xD;
      approach for patients with limited stage FL by The National Comprehensive Cancer Network&#xD;
      (NCCN) is 24Gy~30Gy consolidation RT following effective systemic therapy. There is no&#xD;
      universal consensus for a ''standard'' RT field size in the treatment of limited stage FL.&#xD;
      The involved-site radiotherapy (ISRT) has been treated effectively for these patients.&#xD;
      However, the certain target volumes of ISRT need to be defined for patients with limited&#xD;
      stage FL after effective chemotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the second most common histology of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and&#xD;
      has significantly increased in incidence over the past three decades. FL, grade 1 or 2 has&#xD;
      been recognized as having an indolent natural history with good long-term survival rates&#xD;
      despite a high risk of recurrence. Approximately 25% of patients present with stage I or II&#xD;
      disease (limited stage FL) at diagnosis, and their 10-year overall survival (OS) rate ranges&#xD;
      from 52% to 79%. The treatment options include radiotherapy (RT) alone, immunotherapy ±&#xD;
      chemotherapy, immunotherapy ± chemotherapy + RT, and even observation for selected patients.&#xD;
      There were no differences in OS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RT is an important option for patients with limited stage FL. Despite the evidence and these&#xD;
      international guidelines' recommendation that primary RT has been considered the preferred&#xD;
      treatment approach, RT alone remains worrisomely under used in the treatment of limited stage&#xD;
      FL. The positive result that immediate RT was associated with improved disease-specific and&#xD;
      overall survival (OS) in patients with stage I and II follicular lymphoma has been shown in&#xD;
      SEER data. The OS and disease-free survival (DFS) at 15 years for limited stage FL treated&#xD;
      with RT range from 40% to 66% and 40% to 49%, respectively. However, some controversies&#xD;
      consider that the literature describing outcomes of early-stage follicular lymphoma treated&#xD;
      with RT alone largely consists of retrospective accounts of selected patients from single&#xD;
      institutions treated in an era before modern chemotherapy and staging procedures. For&#xD;
      patients underwent rigorous staging with stage I FL, the results of The National LymphoCare&#xD;
      Study show that progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly improved with either&#xD;
      R-chemotherapy or systemic therapy + RT compared with patients receiving RT alone. The OS has&#xD;
      no differences among the diverse treatment approaches in these patients. This result is also&#xD;
      approved by several recent data both prospective study and retrospective analysis. So, it is&#xD;
      questioned whether RT alone, which was the historical standard, is still the best choice for&#xD;
      patients with limited stage FL. On combined-modality therapy (CMT) of limited stage FL,&#xD;
      combined consolidation RT with brief modern CHOP or CHOP-like chemotherapy can improve the&#xD;
      result of DFS though the OS failed to improvement. At the same time, a definitive&#xD;
      radiation-dose study in indolent lymphoma from the British National Lymphoma Investigation&#xD;
      shows that the 5-year freedom from local progression and OS have no difference either a&#xD;
      radiation dose of 24 Gy or a dose of 40 to 45 Gy, respectively. Therefore, the recommended&#xD;
      approach for patients with limited stage FL by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network&#xD;
      (NCCN) is 24Gy~30Gy consolidation RT following effective systemic therapy. The main&#xD;
      controversy focuses on the timing of RT, the combination between chemotherapy and RT and the&#xD;
      ongoing reduction in radiation field size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FL is generally considered an incurable disease and has a long-term outcomes of PFS and OS.&#xD;
      Long-term complications related to RT among patients with early-stage FL should be focused as&#xD;
      it emphasizes on Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL). In a British study of 2,456 patients with NHL, the&#xD;
      relative risk (RR) of all malignancies were 1.3 per 10,000 person-years. The most common late&#xD;
      non-neoplastic events were cardiac disease and infertility. In a study conducted by the&#xD;
      European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), all late non-neoplastic&#xD;
      events were observed in 46% of 757 patients at a median follow-up of 9.4 years after NHL&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no universal consensus for a ''standard'' RT field size in the treatment of limited&#xD;
      stage FL. The primary objective of reducing the RT field size is to lower rates of&#xD;
      radiation-induced toxicity and radiation-induced second malignancy in long-term survivors&#xD;
      without compromising disease control. Some previous studies show that involved-field RT&#xD;
      (IFRT), involved regional RT (IRRT), and extended-field RT (EFRT) have similar survival&#xD;
      outcomes. Even the radiotherapy field size is involved node RT (INRT). The retrospective&#xD;
      results of Campbell et al show that the PFS was no significant difference for patients who&#xD;
      received IRRT compared with patients who received INRT. Compared with the IRRT group, the&#xD;
      smaller RT field size in the INRT group did not result in an increased risk of distant&#xD;
      failure without infield or regional recurrence (38%vs 32%, respectively). However, the OS was&#xD;
      inferior in the INRT group at 10 years (71% vs 59%). The underlying reason may relate to the&#xD;
      absence of effective systemic therapy. Moreover, there is not the definition of CTV of RT in&#xD;
      the research of Campbell et al. The planning target volume (PTV) of INRT in the research was&#xD;
      also only added with physiologic movement and interfraction setup variation from gross target&#xD;
      volume (GTV) which encompassed the sites of known disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is necessary to design a prospective study with effective systemic therapy and the certain&#xD;
      target volumes to evaluate the efficacy and adverse events of RT with smaller RT field size.&#xD;
      Involved-site radiotherapy (ISRT), based on a modified involved field, aims to reduce the&#xD;
      radiation volume treated and the probability of late effects. Its radiation targets include a&#xD;
      gross tumor volume (GTV), a clinical target volume (CTV), and a planning target volume (PTV),&#xD;
      which were defined in International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements Report&#xD;
      (ICRU) 50. This is based on defining the site of gross disease before chemotherapy, the GTV&#xD;
      and using a CT-based volume with an expansion to form a CTV in the cranio-caudal direction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared to the IFRT, the response rate and toxicities related to involved-site radiotherapy&#xD;
      (ISRT) were to be evaluated for CR and PR patients with limited-stage FL after effective&#xD;
      systemic treatment. The CTV of ISRT is defined as the region including the prechemotherapy&#xD;
      volume of disease with 1.5 cm margin expanded cranio-caudally in the direction of potential&#xD;
      lymphatic spread. The CTV should not extend into air in the transverse plane and should be&#xD;
      limited in the involved lymph node region defined by the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB).&#xD;
      The PTV is then extended from CTV by adding the necessary margin for setup error and organ&#xD;
      motion.&#xD;
