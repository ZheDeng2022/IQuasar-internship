  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study tested the feasibility of utilizing an adaptive intervention strategy for&#xD;
      college students who are suicidal when first seeking treatment at a campus clinic. Right now,&#xD;
      the typical strategy may rely on a &quot;one size fits all&quot; approach, but in fact suicidal&#xD;
      students vary greatly on what and how much they need. This study will pave the way for&#xD;
      subsequent larger trials for clinical decision making (trying one approach, and if that&#xD;
      doesn't work, another) to be empirically developed and tested in a subsequent large-scale&#xD;
      multisite trial with the goal of maximizing resources in overburdened college counseling&#xD;
      centers. This pilot study followed by a subsequent large-scale trial could eventually&#xD;
      significantly impact service delivery to suicidal college students at college counseling&#xD;
      centers.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this proposal was to conduct feasibility research to inform the&#xD;
      implementation of a future full-scale SMART (sequential, multiple assignment, randomized&#xD;
      trial, Almirall et al., 2012) that will be used to construct adaptive treatment strategies&#xD;
      (ATSs) to address suicidality in college students seeking services at college counseling&#xD;
      centers (CCCs). ATSs individualize treatment via decision rules that can specify how the type&#xD;
      and intensity of an intervention should be sequenced based on variables collected&#xD;
      mid-treatment (or at baseline), such as response to treatment. Suicidality is a frequent&#xD;
      presenting concern among college students seeking treatment; yet, studies with this&#xD;
      population show that some students respond rapidly to treatment whereas others may require&#xD;
      considerably more resources. However, at this time, CCCs, which are overburdened and often&#xD;
      have to resort to waitlists, have no guidance as to how to sequence different approaches with&#xD;
      suicidal students in an empirically-based and cost effective manner. Therefore, empirically&#xD;
      validated ATSs are needed in the provision of services to suicidal college students to&#xD;
      address the heterogeneity of students with this presentation and the variability in response&#xD;
      to interventions. In the present pilot SMART, each participant progressed through two stages&#xD;
      of intervention. In the first stage (S1) 62 participants were randomized to one of two brief&#xD;
      individual therapy interventions for 4-8 weeks: 1) one that is suicidality-focused&#xD;
      (Collaborative Assessment and Management of Suicidality (CAMS; Jobes, 2016) and 2) one that&#xD;
      relies on Treatment as Usual (TAU) being provided at a CCC. Responders to either program will&#xD;
      discontinue services/ be stepped down and be monitored over time for maintenance.&#xD;
      Non-responders to either intervention who remain in treatment (estimated n = 18) were&#xD;
      re-randomized to one of two second-stage (S2) higher intensity/dosage intervention options&#xD;
      for an additional 4-16 weeks: 1) CAMS (either continued but for a longer period of time or&#xD;
      administered for the first time) or 2) Comprehensive Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT,&#xD;
      Linehan, 1993a, 1993b) which includes individual therapy, skills groups, and phone coaching&#xD;
      for the clients and DBT peer consultation for the therapists. This study enrolled moderately&#xD;
      to severely suicidal (endorsing thoughts of wanting to die of 2 or above on 0-4 scale)&#xD;
      college students in the &quot;emerging adulthood&quot; phase (18-25 years of age) seeking services at a&#xD;
      CCC. The aims of this feasibility services research project were to 1) develop and refine a&#xD;
      SMART design in a CCC setting; 2) assess the feasibility of conducting a SMART and its&#xD;
      embedded ATSs in a CCC setting; 3) obtain estimates of overall response rates to S1&#xD;
      interventions; and 4) explore the utility of incorporating secondary tailoring variables&#xD;
      (e.g., level of functioning at pre-treatment, ratio of Wish to Live vs. Wish to Die) in the&#xD;
      ATSs in the subsequent larger trial.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This study used a Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) design to pilot 4 adaptive treatment strategies (ATSs): ATS1 - Start with Stage 1 CAMS; if responding, end treatment; if not, continue on to Stage 2 CAMS. ATS2 - Start with Stage 1 CAMS; if responding, end treatment; if not, continue on to Stage 2 DBT. ATS3 - Start with Stage 1 TAU; if responding, end treatment; if not, continue on to Stage 2 CAMS. ATS4 - Start with Stage 1 TAU; if responding, end treatment; if not, continue on to Stage 2 DBT.&#xD;
For Stage 1, we hypothesized that CAMS would show more improvement on suicide-related variables than TAU and would be more effective with suicidal college students presenting with less complexity at baseline. We did not identify hypotheses for clinical outcome variables in Stage 2 because it was exploratory in nature and focused on the feasibility and acceptability of implementing a SMART design to address suicidal risk in college students.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>CAMS adherence ratings conducted by CAMS experts. The CAMS Rating Scale (CRS.3) was used to assess CAMS adherence. The CRS.3 has 14 items rated on a 7-point scale from 0 (Poor) to 6 (Excellent). Therefore, higher scores indicate better adherence. Adherence covers various domains: collaboration (4 items), suicide focus (1 item), risk assessment (1 item), treatment planning (3 items), intervention (2 items), and overall adherence (1 item). Two coders assessed the fidelity of CAMS by observing digitally recorded sessions.</description>

        <description>CAMS adherence ratings conducted by CAMS experts. The CAMS Rating Scale (CRS.3) was used to assess CAMS adherence. The CRS.3 has 14 items rated on a 7-point scale from 0 (Poor) to 6 (Excellent). Therefore, higher scores indicate better adherence. Adherence covers various domains: collaboration (4 items), suicide focus (1 item), risk assessment (1 item), treatment planning (3 items), intervention (2 items), and overall adherence (1 item). Two coders assessed the fidelity of CAMS by observing digitally recorded sessions.</description>

        <description>DBT adherence ratings conducted by DBT adherence experts. The University of Washington Dialectical Behavior Therapy Adherence Coding Scale (DBTACS) was utilized to check DBT adherence. The DBTACS has various dimensions, each measured on a 5-point scale (ranging from 0.0-5.0, with 5 indicating greater adherence). Therefore, higher scores indicate better adherence. The overall score is an average of these dimensions with a cutoff of 4.0 for adherence.</description>
        <time_frame>During Stage 2 (sessions 9 through 24 of treatment)</time_frame>
        <population>Approximately 1-2 DBT session tapes per five counselors (two counselors did not have available tapes) were semi-randomly selected and rated for adherence. It should be noted that DBTACS adherence scores are specific to a given session and only when multiple consecutive sessions are rated is the conclusion that a therapist is &quot;adherent&quot; warranted.</population>

        <description>The SSI is an interviewer-rated measure based on 19 questions related to the highest intensity of suicidal ideation in the past 2 weeks, including attitudes, behaviors, and plans. Each item is rated as 0,1, or 2 and the total scale yields a score of 0-38. Higher scores indicate greater suicide risk.</description>
        <time_frame>End of Stage 1 interventions - ~8 weeks after baseline; End of Stage 2 interventions ~24 weeks after baseline; and Follow-up (3 months after all treatment has ended) ~36 weeks after baseline</time_frame>
        <population>Not all participants were assessed at S1 due to several participants declining assessments or missing the assessment window. Data are only included for S1 treatment arms in line with our pre-specified research aim to obtain estimates of overall response rates to S1 interventions. Clinical outcome variables were not interpreted at Stage 2 because it was exploratory in nature focusing on the feasibility/acceptability of implementing a SMART design to address suicidal risk in college students.</population>

        <population>Note: Some attrition/respondent drop-out is present throughout this study. Data are only included for S1 treatment arms in line with our pre-specified research aim to obtain estimates of overall response rates to S1 interventions. Clinical outcome variables were not interpreted at Stage 2 because it was exploratory in nature focusing on the feasibility/acceptability of implementing a SMART design to address suicidal risk in college students.</population>

    <limitations_and_caveats>The study focused on acceptability and feasibility. Although data was collected for Stage 2 and analyzed for acceptability and feasibility outcomes (e.g., CSQ), clinical outcomes (e.g., SSI, CCAPS) were only interpreted for Stage 1 due to small sample sizes among the Stage 2 groups. A larger study is needed to identify the most effective sequence of care for suicidal risk treatments at college counseling centers.</limitations_and_caveats>
