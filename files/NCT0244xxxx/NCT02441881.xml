      Purpose To establish which of the radiofrequency venous ablation modalities is most effective&#xD;
      in preventing reflux in the treated segment of GSV six months following surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design Results of randomised trials and meta-analyses have shown that endovenous thermal&#xD;
      ablation using radiofrequency ablation and laser are associated with improved recovery&#xD;
      compared with conventional surgery on the GSV. Further, radiofrequency (Closurefast) has been&#xD;
      showed to cause less pain and require less analgesic intake than laser. There are two other&#xD;
      radiofrequency devices that have theoretical advantages over the Closurefast technique. All&#xD;
      three procedures have been used in clinical practice (including at Worcestershire Royal&#xD;
      Hospital). There has been no trial to date which has directly compared the outcomes of the&#xD;
      three radiofrequency thermal ablation devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Patients will be recruited from Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust vascular&#xD;
      surgical out-patient clinics. All patients will receive a duplex scan (Toshiba Viamo&#xD;
      Ultrasound, Tokyo, Japan or Sonosite M-Turbo Bothell, Washington, USA) prior to entry into&#xD;
      the trial to confirm their suitability for endovenous thermal ablation treatment. During this&#xD;
      assessment patients will also have their CEAP (Clinical, Etiological, Anatomical, and&#xD;
      Pathophysiological) classification of severity and aetiology of venous disease score&#xD;
      recorded. If the patient consents to the trial they will be asked to fill in the disease&#xD;
      specific Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire (AVVQ)and generic quality of life SF-36 and&#xD;
      Euroquol (EQ-5D) questionnaires and have their Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS)&#xD;
      calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited to the trial following an appropriate explanation of the study&#xD;
      (see patient information / consent sheet). Randomisation will be performed by a random number&#xD;
      generator (www.random.org).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomised to radiofrequency ablation either by Closurefast (Venefit, VNUS&#xD;
      Medical Technologies, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA), the Radiofrequency induced Thermal Therapy&#xD;
      (RFiTT, Olympus Surgical Technologies Europe, Hamburg, Germany) or EndoVenous Radiofrequency&#xD;
      (EVRF, Medical Innovations, Bolton, United Kingdom). All treatments are already in use in&#xD;
      Worcestershire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operation All treatments will be performed under local tumescent anaesthesia. Patients will&#xD;
      receive thromboprophylaxis when indicated in line with the Hospital Trust's local&#xD;
      thromboprophylaxis protocol. Procedures will be performed under duplex control (Sonosite&#xD;
      M-Turbo, Bothell, Washington, USA) by an experienced vascular surgery Specialist Registrar or&#xD;
      Consultant. The GSV will be catheterised percutaneously using a Seldinger technique at the&#xD;
      level of the lowest point of reflux. The radiofrequency treatment catheter will be passed&#xD;
      endoluminally to the level of the sapheno-femoral junction. Tumescent anaesthesia (50mg&#xD;
      Prilocaine, 10mls 8.4% sodium bicarbonate in 1000mls 0.9% saline) will be injected in the&#xD;
      peri-venous space in all patients (200 - 500ml). The position of the radiofrequency catheter&#xD;
      will be confirmed just below the level of the sapheno-femoral junction prior to commencing&#xD;
      the radiofrequency current and withdrawing the catheter to treat the vein in line with local&#xD;
      practice. The Closurefast is withdrawn after a double treatment of the most proximal segment&#xD;
      of the long saphenous vein and then segmentally thereafter, the RFiTT will be withdrawn&#xD;
      continuously with retreatments, and the EVRF will be withdrawn in small stepwise movements&#xD;
      (all as per the manufacturer's instructions for use). The volume of anaesthetic administered,&#xD;
      length of vein treated and duration of the ablation will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In line with current NICE guidance (CG168), where necessary, patients will undergo avulsions&#xD;
      of local varicosities at the same time. The number of avulsions will be recorded in both&#xD;
      groups. Perforating veins will not be directly treated. Treated legs will be dressed with&#xD;
      dressing pads a full length bandage (coban, 3M United Kingdom plc, Bracknell, Berkshire, UK)&#xD;
      and compression hosiery. Patients will be discharged on the day of surgery (day-case) with&#xD;
      oral analgesia as required and will be given contact information should any adverse events&#xD;
      arise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) First week Patients will be asked to keep a pain score for the first post-operative week.&#xD;
      This is a simple 10cm visual analogue score. All patients will be invited back to clinic at&#xD;
      two weeks for a duplex scan (blind assessment). During this visit the vascular team will&#xD;
      assess any complications in the area of ablation including bruising (digital photographic&#xD;
      record), wound infection, neuralgia, deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii) Six months The primary endpoint of the study is an ablated GSV. Treatment failure will be&#xD;
      defined as any segment of the treated trunk (&gt; 2cm from the saphenofemoral junction) that is&#xD;
      patent (compressible) and demonstrates reflux (&gt;1 second) on duplex scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of secondary outcome measures will be evaluated in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain score/ analgesic requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time to return to normal activity&#xD;
&#xD;
      Absence or recurrent varicose veins/return of symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality Of Life (QoL): Disease specific (AVVQ) and generic (EQ5D &amp; SF36) quality of life&#xD;
      assessments will be compared at 1 weeks post treatment, 6 months and 12 months. The 1-week&#xD;
      questionnaire will be given to the patient at discharge, whereas other QoL questionnaires&#xD;
      will be sent to the patient. AVVQ is the most widely utilised disease specific QoL tool in&#xD;
      venous disease and has been extensively validated. A score out of 100 points is calculated,&#xD;
      with a higher score indicating more severe QoL impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other Markers Of Clinical Success: The Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS) will be assessed&#xD;
      at 6 months. In addition, the incidence of complications related to the endovenous&#xD;
      intervention as well as the presence of residual / recurrent varicose veins will also be&#xD;
      assessed at 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medium and longer-term endpoints (follow-up) will be performed at 2 years and 5 years.&#xD;
      However, this is likely to be limited by the high rates (&gt;20%) of drop-out reported in other&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
