      This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of the EndoBarrier® SANS™ in overweight and&#xD;
      obese subjects with type 2 diabetes. The barbless second generation device is being developed&#xD;
      as a means to reduce the incidence of adverse events associated with the barbs of the&#xD;
      predicate device while maintaining a similar efficacy profile as measured by changes in&#xD;
      weight and diabetic endpoints (HbA1c, blood glucose, insulin, etc.). This first use in human&#xD;
      will primarily evaluate preliminary safety, tolerability and efficacy of the new design.&#xD;
      Because of the new design and its first study in human subjects, only a 3 month implant&#xD;
      duration will be evaluated in this study.&#xD;

      The GI Dynamics' EndoBarrier® SANS™ is an endoscopically positioned device that represents an&#xD;
      alternative to the use of gastric bypass operative techniques as a means of re-routing food&#xD;
      and altering the gut-hormone axis. The EndoBarrier® SANS™ provides an alternate passage of&#xD;
      chime through the duodenum and proximal sixty centimeters of jejunum replicating in part the&#xD;
      bypass of bariatric surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted at a single clinical site in Malaysia. Approximately 16 subjects&#xD;
      will be enrolled in two cohorts of 8 subjects. The two cohorts will be implanted one week&#xD;
      apart with the implantation of the second cohort triggered by the absence of major technical&#xD;
      or clinical issues (i.e. safety, tolerability) observed in the first cohort in the first&#xD;
      seven days.&#xD;
