    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, open label study of the efficacy of&#xD;
      AVAPS-AE to prevent re-hospitalization in hospitalized patients with comorbid COPD.&#xD;
      Hospitalized patients with comorbid COPD who are at high risk for readmission will be&#xD;
      recruited. Specifically patients with comorbid COPD who are to be discharged with (a)&#xD;
      admission diagnosis of COPD (GOLD stage II or greater); AND (b) either a prior non-elective&#xD;
      hospitalization (one in the past 12 months) OR active smoker. Such participants will undergo&#xD;
      questionnaire-based screening for sleep-disordered breathing (STOP-BANG questionnaire) and if&#xD;
      they have a high risk for Sleep Disordered Breathing (SDB) (&gt; 3 points) will undergo an&#xD;
      overnight portable sleep study for screening prior to hospital discharge (AHI &gt; 10 per hour;&#xD;
      &gt;3% oxygen desaturation for hypopneas).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After randomization and prior to discharge, participants will either be initiated on AVAPS-AE&#xD;
      therapy (intervention arm) for 60 days or will be referred to the sleep center for further&#xD;
      diagnostic testing and therapy initiation (standard of care arm). Participants will complete&#xD;
      quality of life questionnaires Functional outcomes of sleep questionnaire (FOSQ) at baseline&#xD;
      (in-person), and in 30 and 60 days (by mail) post discharge. Information regarding hospital&#xD;
      admission, diagnostic tests, medication changes, and procedures will be collected from all&#xD;
      participants. Discharge summaries of re-hospitalizations and office or ER visits, as well as&#xD;
      diagnostics tests and therapies received will be collected for measuring healthcare costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have an option to enroll in a registry for a 3 year follow-up and will also&#xD;
      be queried on a yearly basis regarding hospitalizations, cardiovascular events, and&#xD;
      assessment of vital statistics in the National Death Index registry. The study will conclude&#xD;
      when all randomized participants have been followed for a minimum of 60 days.&#xD;

    <description>Evaluate the effects of novel application of Averaged Volume Assured Pressure Support (AVAPS-AE) therapy on health-related quality of life. The Short Form 36 (SF-36) is a set of quality of life measures. Participants were asked at 30 days and 60 days in general what their overall health was. On a scale of 1 to 5 -1 being excellent, 5 being poor.</description>

    <measure>Change in Quality of Life (FOSQ) at 30 and 60 Days</measure>
    <time_frame>30 and 60 days post-discharge</time_frame>
    <description>FOSQ is a quality of life questionnaire for sleep disorders. It's a 30 question survey with 5 subgroups: general productivity (8 questions), social outcome (2 questions),activity level (9 questions), vigilance (7 questions) and intimate relationships &amp; sexual activity (4 questions).&#xD;
Scores are provided on a 0 to 4 scale:&#xD;
0- I don't do this activity for other reasons or missing response&#xD;
1- Yes, extreme difficulty 4- no difficulty The average score was calculated based upon average sub-scores. The total score was, calculated using the mean of the subscale scores and multiplying the mean by the number of subscales. The range of scores for the total score is 5-20. The measures are designed to assess the impact of disorders of excessive sleepiness on activities of everyday living and the extent to which these abilities are improved by effective treatment. The lower the score the more difficulty a person has carrying out certain activities because they are too sleepy or tired.</description>

        <title>Change in Quality of Life (FOSQ) at 30 and 60 Days</title>
        <description>FOSQ is a quality of life questionnaire for sleep disorders. It's a 30 question survey with 5 subgroups: general productivity (8 questions), social outcome (2 questions),activity level (9 questions), vigilance (7 questions) and intimate relationships &amp; sexual activity (4 questions).&#xD;
Scores are provided on a 0 to 4 scale:&#xD;
0- I don't do this activity for other reasons or missing response&#xD;
1- Yes, extreme difficulty 4- no difficulty The average score was calculated based upon average sub-scores. The total score was, calculated using the mean of the subscale scores and multiplying the mean by the number of subscales. The range of scores for the total score is 5-20. The measures are designed to assess the impact of disorders of excessive sleepiness on activities of everyday living and the extent to which these abilities are improved by effective treatment. The lower the score the more difficulty a person has carrying out certain activities because they are too sleepy or tired.</description>
