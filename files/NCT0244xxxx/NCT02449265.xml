  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The most common option of radiotherapy for patients with limited-stage DLBCL is&#xD;
      involved-field radiotherapy (IFRT). The more limited radiotherapy field size changing from&#xD;
      IFRT to reasonable margin from gross tumor has been reported to maintain the high rates of&#xD;
      local disease control, while minimizing the risks of radiation-induced toxicities. However,&#xD;
      the research didn't analyze whether the efficacy of consolidation involved-site radiotherapy&#xD;
      (ISRT) be affected by the response of chemotherapy. The biologic definition of clinical&#xD;
      target volume (CTV) of ISRT and actual radiotherapy field size need to be ascertained.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a heterogenous group of lymphomas and constitutes&#xD;
      approximately one-third of all non-Hodgkin lymphoma diagnoses. At diagnosis, approximately&#xD;
      25% to 30% of patients are found to have limited-stage disease (stage I-II). The&#xD;
      combined-modality therapy (CMT) including chemotherapy and involved-field radiotherapy (IFRT)&#xD;
      is the optimal management of limited-stage DLBCL. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network&#xD;
      (NCCN) guidelines recommend three cycles of R-CHOP+IFRT for early-stage, nonbulky disease but&#xD;
      also allow the administration of six to eight cycles of R-CHOP with or without IFRT. These&#xD;
      patients have a favorable prognosis with 5-year overall survival (OS) rates reported between&#xD;
      70% and 92% following curative-intent treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In fact, the value from consolidation radiotherapy (RT) in limited-stage DLBCL is uncertain&#xD;
      in several well-known reports. These include the report of late relapses in the SWOG study,&#xD;
      the lack of benefit for adding RT to brief chemotherapy in a European study of elderly&#xD;
      patients, and the reported advantage of an intensive chemotherapy regimen over brief CHOP&#xD;
      plus RT in younger patients studied in Europe. On the other hand, it is uncertain how many&#xD;
      cycles' chemotherapy combining consolidation RT is adequate to maintain the efficacy of CMT&#xD;
      for patients with limited-stage DLBCL. In the trial of GELA LNH 93-1, an aggressive&#xD;
      chemotherapy alone, a regimen were dose-intensified doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vindesine,&#xD;
      bleomycin, and prednisone (ACVBP), was designed to compare with three cycles of CHOP plus&#xD;
      IFRT in patients with stage I-II mostly low-risk aggressive lymphoma. Patients who receive&#xD;
      the dose-intensity chemotherapy had significantly higher 5-year event-free and overall&#xD;
      survival (OS) rates because the abbreviated therapy was not enough to overcome the excessive&#xD;
      distant relapses. In the SWOG 8736 trial, the results were clearly in favor of keeping RT on&#xD;
      board, but the progression-free survival (PFS) and OS curves between three cycles of&#xD;
      CHOP+IFRT arm and eight cycles of CHOP arm begin to overlap at 7 years and at 9 years after&#xD;
      treatment because of the excess number of late lymphoma relapses in the group that received&#xD;
      three cycles of CHOP+IFRT. For patients older than 60 years with localized aggressive&#xD;
      lymphoma, the results of the GELA LNH 93-4 trial show that 5-year event-free survival (EFS)&#xD;
      and OS were no significant differences between four cycles of CHOP alone and four cycles of&#xD;
      CHOP followed by radiation therapy. In summary, it is not sufficient that three cycles of&#xD;
      CHOP as systemic treatment in the abbreviated therapy treated limited-stage DLBCL according&#xD;
      to the results of previous randomized trials. These findings are consistent with the&#xD;
      retrospective results of the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC). Six to eight cycles of&#xD;
      chemotherapy may be the adequate management for patients with limited-stage DLBCL who&#xD;
      received RT to ensure a significantly better outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to increase the clinical benefit and decrease the late complications related to&#xD;
      irradiation and/or chemotherapy, consolidation RT following chemotherapy in patients with&#xD;
      limited-stage DLBCL has been directed in recent years. This is based on the observation that&#xD;
      local recurrence is the most common pattern of first failure following systemic therapy alone&#xD;
      and IFRT achieves excellent infield control in the original sites of disease. Improved local&#xD;
      control, achieved by the addition of radiotherapy, may translate into improvements in&#xD;
      long-term outcomes. The advantages of the addition of RT are obvious in the reduction of&#xD;
      adverse events of dose-intensified or more cycles' chemotherapy, in the increase of local&#xD;
      control, and even in the improvement of OS. However, the complications related to&#xD;
      consolidation RT, including second malignancies and other non-neoplastic late events, were&#xD;
      also needed to emphasize for those patients with limited-stage DLBCL, who were cured and have&#xD;
      a long-term survival. Reducing the morbidity of treatment is an important consideration to&#xD;
      optimize the therapeutic ratio. The prefer options include radiation field size reduction and&#xD;
      radiotherapy dose decrease. The general dose had been guided that 30-36Gy was managed for&#xD;
      patients with complete response (CR) after chemotherapy and 40-50Gy for partial response&#xD;
      (PR). Comparing to extensive-field radiotherapy, the brief chemotherapy followed by IFRT for&#xD;
      early-stage disease is safe and significantly more effective. In order to maintain the high&#xD;
      rates of local disease control achieved by RT, while minimizing the risks of&#xD;
      radiation-induced toxicities, the more limited radiotherapy field size changing from IFRT to&#xD;
      reasonable margin from gross tumor has been reported in patients with limited-stage DLBCL.&#xD;
      The Korean retrospective results reported by Yu show that the OS and relapse-free survival&#xD;
      (RFS) at 10 years managed by Involved-node radiotherapy (INRT) following median 4 cycles of&#xD;
      CHOP or R-CHOP chemotherapy has the same treatment results compared to IFRT on 86 patients&#xD;
      with stage I, II head and neck DLBCL. The radiotherapy field size of INRT are more localized&#xD;
      to cover the prechemotherapy gross disease with margins of at least 2 to 3 cm while not&#xD;
      include ipsilateral whole neck. Aim to reduce radiotherapy-induced toxicities, Campbell et&#xD;
      al. reduced the field size from IFRT to INRT&lt;5 cm in the treatment of limited-stage DLBCL&#xD;
      with abbreviated systemic therapy and consolidation RT. The results show that distant-only&#xD;
      relapse was the most common pattern of first failure, and marginal-only relapse was&#xD;
      reassuringly infrequent (2%) in the group of INRT. The TTP, PFS, and OS don't be affected by&#xD;
      radiotherapy field reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Smaller RT fields will translate to lower rates of radiation-induced toxicity and&#xD;
      radiation-induced second malignancy in long-term survivors. Unfortunately, some limitation of&#xD;
      the INRT reported in previous studies will be undertaken. The involved sites are only in head&#xD;
      and neck and comparison arms are not designed in the Korean research. Though the results of&#xD;
      Campbell et al show that reducing the field size from IFRT to INRT&lt;5 cm maintains a low&#xD;
      marginal recurrence risk with no impact on overall outcome, the research was retrospective&#xD;
      and didn't analyze whether the efficacy of consolidation INRT be affected by the response of&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Moreover, the clinical target volume (CTV) of INRT in the research of Campbell&#xD;
      et al encompassed the prechemotherapy volume of disease, within postchemotherapy anatomical&#xD;
      limits instead of biologic region of the subclinical of gross disease. At the same time, a&#xD;
      physical concept, the planning target volume (PTV) must be formed from CTV considering&#xD;
      physiological movement and interfraction set-up variation. For this, the up-to 5 cm directed&#xD;
      in &quot;involved-node radiotherapy with margins up to 5 cm (INRT&lt;5 cm) '' by Campbell et al&#xD;
      accounts for the non-uniform margins. The actual radiotherapy field size varied according to&#xD;
      the discretion of the treating radiation oncologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is necessary that a research without the limitation being in previous study should be&#xD;
      designed to evaluate the efficacy of RT with smaller RT field size following sufficient&#xD;
      systemic treatment for patients with limited-stage DLBCL. Involved-site radiotherapy (ISRT),&#xD;
      based on a modified involved field, aims to reduce the radiation volume treated and the&#xD;
      probability of late effects. Its radiation targets include a gross tumor volume (GTV), a&#xD;
      clinical target volume (CTV), and a planning target volume (PTV), which were defined in&#xD;
      International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements Report (ICRU) 50. This is based&#xD;
      on defining the site of gross disease before chemotherapy, the GTV and using a CT-based&#xD;
      volume with an expansion to form a CTV in the cranio-caudal direction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared to the IFRT, the PFS and toxicities related to involved-site radiotherapy (ISRT)&#xD;
      were to be evaluated for CR and PR patients with limited-stage DLBCL after sufficient&#xD;
      systemic treatment. The CTV of ISRT is defined as the region including the prechemotherapy&#xD;
      volume of disease with 1.5 cm margin expanded cranio-caudally in the direction of potential&#xD;
      lymphatic spread. The CTV should not extend into air in the transverse plane and should be&#xD;
      limited in the involved lymph node region defined by the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB).&#xD;
      The PTV is then extended from CTV by adding the necessary margin for setup error and organ&#xD;
      motion.&#xD;
