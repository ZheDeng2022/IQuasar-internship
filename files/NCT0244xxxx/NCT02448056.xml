      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver cancer and the third leading&#xD;
      cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Treatments of HCC include surgical resection, local&#xD;
      therapies such as radiofrequency ablation and ethanol injection, transarterial&#xD;
      chemoembolization, sorafenib and best supportive care. However, even after successful&#xD;
      treatment such as surgical resection, most patients suffered from recurrence or progression&#xD;
      of the tumor. Because clinical staging systems cannot precisely predict the outcome of&#xD;
      patients with HCC, it's of great interest to search serum biomarkers for HCC. Among them,&#xD;
      alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is the most well-studied. However, the applicability of AFP for HCC&#xD;
      after surgical resection of tumor or after local therapy is still uncertain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MicroRNAs (miRNAs), 17- to 25-nucleotide non-coding RNAs, are frequently dysregulated in&#xD;
      cancer and emerging as novel non-invasive biomarker for cancer screening, diagnosis, monitor&#xD;
      therapy efficacy and predict prognosis. MiRNAs are stably expression in serum as their&#xD;
      resistance to endogenous RNase and easily storage with high stability. Several studies have&#xD;
      shown abnormal expression of human serum miRNAs in many cancers such as liver, colorectal,&#xD;
      and pancreatic cancer. The sensitivity of miRNA as a diagnostic biomarker of HCC could be&#xD;
      upto 80%. Using miRNA arrays can generate miRNA signatures and improve the sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity of biomarker for tumor diagnosis and prognosis prediction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will establish an miRNA platform as biomarkers for&#xD;
      diagnostic or prognostic tools of HCC. The investigators will also compare the miRNA&#xD;
      expression level before and after treatment in the serum and correlate the miRNA expression&#xD;
      between serum and tumor tissue.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common cancer and the third mortality rate&#xD;
      of cancer in the world (Kamangar et al., 2006). Treatments of hepatocellular carcinoma&#xD;
      include surgical resection, local therapies such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and&#xD;
      percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI), transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), and best&#xD;
      supportive care(Bruix and Sherman, 2005). For patients who are not candidates for surgical&#xD;
      intervention or local therapies, sorafenib is recommended (Cheng et al., 2009; Llovet et al.,&#xD;
      2008). However, even after successful treatment such as surgical resection, most patients&#xD;
      suffered from recurrence or progression of the tumor (Bruix and Sherman, 2005; Llovet et al.,&#xD;
      2002; Llovet et al., 2008). Though there are several staging systems of HCC have been&#xD;
      developed, such as the Okuda staging system, AJCC system, BCLC staging system, and CLIP&#xD;
      scoring system, the prognostic value of each staging systems are not consistent(Chen et al.,&#xD;
      2009), and applicability of each staging system depends on the treatment methodology&#xD;
      selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the shortcoming of clinical staging systems in predicting the outcome of HCC, it&#xD;
      is of great interest to search serum biomarkers to predict the prognosis HCC (Fujiyama et&#xD;
      al., 2002; Marrero and Lok, 2004). Among them, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is the mostly&#xD;
      well-studied. AFP has been used as a marker in diagnosing HCC (Bruix et al., 2001) and as a&#xD;
      prognostic factor for newly diagnosed HCC(1998). AFP is also of value as a predictive factor&#xD;
      for chemotherapy response (Chan et al., 2009). However, the applicability of AFP for HCC&#xD;
      after surgical resection of tumor or after local therapy is still uncertain. For patients&#xD;
      with HCC and normal serum level of AFP, APF could not be used a prognostic factor. Other&#xD;
      biomarkers, such as glipecan-3, are still under development (Marrero and Lok, 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      MicroRNAs (miRNAs), 17- to 25-nucleotide non-coding RNAs, are frequently dysregulated in&#xD;
      cancer and emerging as novel non-invasive biomarker for cancer screening, diagnosis, monitor&#xD;
      therapy efficacy and predict prognosis (Wu et al., 2007). MiRNAs are stably expression in&#xD;
      serum as their resistance to endogenous RNase and easily storage with high stability (Aref et&#xD;
      al., 2014). Several studies have shown abnormal expression of human serum miRNAs in many&#xD;
      cancers such as liver, colorectal, and pancreatic cancer (Huang et al., 2010; Liu et al.,&#xD;
      2012; Qi et al., 2013). The sensitivity of miRNA as a diagnostic biomarker of HCC could be up&#xD;
      to 80% (Yin et al., 2014). Using miRNA arrays can generate miRNA signatures and further&#xD;
      improve the sensitivity and specificity of biomarker for tumor diagnosis and prognosis&#xD;
      prediction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial purpose：&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To identify serum miRNA as a diagnosis or prediction biomarker for HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To correlate with the expression level of miRNA between serum, HCC tumor tissue and&#xD;
           adjacent non-tumor tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To collect and store deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) for future exploratory research into&#xD;
           genes/genetic variation that may influence response to treatment in HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To collect and store surplus plasma and tumor tissues for future exploratory research&#xD;
           into proteins/genes/genetic variation that may influence response to treatment in HCCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods： Study design This is a prospective study. All patients need to provide informed&#xD;
      consents. A total of 200 patients aged &gt;20 year-old who are diagnosed HCC in the National&#xD;
      Taiwan University and Far-Eastern Memorial Hospital will be enrolled. The diagnostic criteria&#xD;
      of HCC are according to 2011 AASLD criteria (Bruix et al., 2011). In brief, nodules more than&#xD;
      1 cm found on ultrasound screening of a cirrhotic liver should be investigated further with&#xD;
      one dynamic studies, either CT scan or contrast MRI. If the appearance is typical of HCC&#xD;
      (i.e., hypervascular with washout in the portal/venous phase) in one technique, the lesion&#xD;
      would be diagnosed as HCC. If the findings are not characteristic or the vascular profile is&#xD;
      not coincidental among techniques the lesion should be biopsied. For clinical staging, two&#xD;
      staging systems will be applied to these patients, including BCLC staging and clinical TNM&#xD;
      system. The clinicopathological data will be collected prospectively. Clinical outcomes,&#xD;
      including treatment toxicity, treatment response as defined by the revised RECIST criteria,&#xD;
      disease-progression, and overall survival will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specimen and serum collection Blood samples will be collected at 3 time points-pre-treatment,&#xD;
      7 days after treatment and one month after treatment. Blood samples will be separated in&#xD;
      plasma and mononuclear cells upon collection and will be stored in -20Ç before further use.&#xD;
      The treatment methods include operation, TACE, RFA, PEI, or anti-angiogenesis agent including&#xD;
      sorafenib use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tissue collection The HCC tissues (T) and the corresponding non-tumor liver tissues (NT) will&#xD;
      be obtained. The surgical specimens will be frozen immediately after surgery and stored in&#xD;
      -140°C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Viral marker Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibody to HCV (anti-HCV) will be&#xD;
      checked using commercially available enzyme linked immunosorbant assay kits for every&#xD;
      patient. For HBsAg positive patient, HBeAg and anti-HBe will be measured by enzyme linked&#xD;
      immunosorbant assay. Serum level of HBV DNA will be measured by in house TaqMan real-time&#xD;
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR). For anti-HCV positive patients, HCV RNA will be measured by&#xD;
      in house TaqMan real-time PCR&#xD;
&#xD;
      RNA isolation, reverse transcription and miRNA array Blood samples drawn into EDTA containing&#xD;
      tubes and centrifuged at 4,000x g for 15 min for plasma separation. Plasma transferred into a&#xD;
      clean micro centrifuge tube and centrifuged again at 12,000x g for 5 min and 200 ul of plasma&#xD;
      will be transferred to a new micro centrifuge tube and stored at -80 _C until analysis. RNA&#xD;
      will isolated using High Pure miRNA Isolation Kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) according to the&#xD;
      manufacturer's instructions and then stored at -80 _C until the experiment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reverse transcription reaction For miRNA analyses by quantitative real-time polymerase chain&#xD;
      reaction (qRT-PCR), 100 ng of total RNA will be reverse-transcribed using the TaqMan miRNA&#xD;
      Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA). All reactions will be&#xD;
      performed as specified in the manufacturers protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TaqMan low-density arrays TLDA will be analysed to identify the profile of differentially&#xD;
      expressed miRNAs between the three sets of samples (pre-treatment, 7 days post-treatment, one&#xD;
      month post treatment). In brief, total RNA will reverse-transcribed into cDNA by the TaqMan&#xD;
      MicroRNA Reverse Transcription Kit and Megaplex RT set pool A and B version 3.0 (Applied&#xD;
      Biosystems). The RT product will loaded into TaqMan Array Human MicroRNA A+B Cards Set v3.0&#xD;
      (Applied Biosystems), enabling simultaneous quantitation of 667 human miRNAs. TaqMan microRNA&#xD;
      assays and analysis will be performed on the ABI 7900HT Instrument (Applied Biosystems). All&#xD;
      reactions were performed according to the standard manufacturers' protocols. Quantitative&#xD;
      miRNA expression data were acquired and normalized using ABI 7900HT SDS software (Applied&#xD;
      Biosystems).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) Expression of miRNA detected via TaqMan low-density&#xD;
      arrays will also be studied as well in the HCC tumors and / or their paired normal liver&#xD;
      tissue by qRT-PCR analysis as described previously (Lee et al., 2011). RNU6B snRNA was used&#xD;
      as an endogenous control. Each microRNA assay was performed in triplicate. Expression of&#xD;
      microRNAs was reported as delta Ct value (Ct value of RNU6B - Ct value of target microRNA).&#xD;
      The investigators defined the groups of tumors or cells with high or low expression based on&#xD;
      the median expression value of each microRNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Overall survival and progression-free survival will be evaluated using&#xD;
      Kaplan-Meier's method. Once a specific protein is identified by the proteomic study, patients&#xD;
      will be divided into high expression group and low expression group, according to the median&#xD;
      plasma expression level of the miRNA of all patients; survival difference between high&#xD;
      expression group and low expression group will be analyzed using log-rank test. p-value less&#xD;
      than 0.05 will be regarded as significant.&#xD;
