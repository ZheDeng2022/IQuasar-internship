  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite evidence regarding the benefits of physical activity in various cancer patient&#xD;
      populations, the effects of a home-based walking program for pancreatic cancer patients have&#xD;
      been under-explored. The aims of the proposed pilot project are to: (1) Assess the&#xD;
      feasibility of implementing a 12-week, home-based walking program among pancreatic cancer&#xD;
      patients; and (2) Examine the effects of a 12-week, home-based walking program on quality of&#xD;
      life (QOL) and symptoms among pancreatic cancer patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Among cancer patients, physical activity interventions can lead to improvements in QOL and&#xD;
      reductions in fatigue and pain. While pancreatic cancer patients may have physical&#xD;
      restrictions that limit their participation in moderate to high-intensity exercise&#xD;
      activities, empirical evidence suggests that even low-intensity, home-based walking programs&#xD;
      can confer benefits for cancer patients. In this pilot study, 50 patients will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to receive either the walking intervention program or usual care (UC). Assessments&#xD;
      of quality of life, distress, and symptom burden will be completed at baseline&#xD;
      (pre-intervention) and at follow-up (i.e. within 2 weeks post-intervention or approximately&#xD;
      12-14 weeks post-baseline). Data from the proposed pilot study will inform the development of&#xD;
      a larger randomized trial designed to improve QOL and reduce morbidity in this patient&#xD;
      population.&#xD;

    <description>Intervention patients will receive a 12-week home-based walking program, which includes a personalized instruction booklet and pedometer. The walking program consists of 3 phases and will be individualized for each patient based on their physical condition and baseline assessment. Patients are instructed to walk 3 to 5 times each week at home or other safe environment. Patients will be instructed on a gradual increase in walking time over the course of the intervention.</description>
