      The goal of this study is to examine how cellular dysfunction can lead to preterm birth.&#xD;
      Women with singleton pregnancies with spontaneous preterm labor, preterm premature rupture of&#xD;
      membranes, and cervical insufficiency (20 to 36-6/7 weeks gestation), and term deliveries&#xD;
      (greater than 38 weeks) will be enrolled. Medical/obstetric history and pregnancy outcomes&#xD;
      will be recorded. Maternal blood, urine and cervical cells (enrollment); cord blood and&#xD;
      placental biopsy (delivery) will be collected.&#xD;

      Despite improvements in prenatal care, preterm birth (PTB) remains a leading contributor to&#xD;
      perinatal morbidity and mortality. Several genetic and environmental factors have been&#xD;
      associated with spontaneous preterm birth, but the pathways by which these factors induce&#xD;
      preterm delivery have not been defined. The March of Dimes CPR at the University of&#xD;
      Pennsylvania was created to help elucidate the pathogenesis of preterm birth by bringing&#xD;
      together a diverse team of investigators with expertise in preterm birth, cellular&#xD;
      metabolism, genetics, mitochondrial functional analyses, genome, epigenome, and transcriptome&#xD;
      profiling, integrated bioinformatics analyses, and microbiome research. The center will focus&#xD;
      on addressing the interactions between bioenergetics, genetics, microbiome, abnormal cervical&#xD;
      remodeling and placental dysfunction. Each one of these factors will be studied independently&#xD;
      and in relation to the other factors. In order to study metabolic processes in relation to&#xD;
      spontaneous PTB, a prospective case-control study will be performed. This study will involve&#xD;
      women with singleton pregnancies with spontaneous preterm labor (PTL), preterm premature&#xD;
      rupture of membranes (PPROM), and cervical insufficiency, between 20-0/7 and 36-6/7 weeks&#xD;
      gestational age (cases), and women with term deliveries (38 to 41 weeks gestation, controls).&#xD;
      The investigators will obtain information regarding the patients' pertinent past medical and&#xD;
      obstetric histories, and the following specimens will be collected: maternal blood, maternal&#xD;
      urine, and cervical epithelial cells at enrollment; and umbilical cord blood and placental&#xD;
      biopsies at delivery. We will follow and record each of these patients' pregnancy outcomes.&#xD;

      1. Collect blood, urine and cervicovaginal cells from women with preterm labor and term labor&#xD;
      in order to investigate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What is the role of bioenergetics in pregnancy and what are the pertubations in cell&#xD;
           metabolism that lead to spontaneous preterm birth&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What are the interactions between the microbiome (oral, gut, cervicovaginal, and&#xD;
           placental) and host metabolic function in pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. How do interactions between cell metabolism and the microbiome influence cervical&#xD;
           remodeling and placental function leading to spontaneous preterm delivery&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. What genetic and environmental factors influence the metabolic function of reproductive&#xD;
           tissues leading to spontaneous preterm delivery&#xD;

        At HUP, there are approximately 4,200 deliveries a year, of which approximately 10 percent&#xD;
        (420) deliver preterm. Among these preterm births, two-thirds (280) are spontaneous, which&#xD;
        is the focus of our research. Many women who ultimately have a preterm birth, first present&#xD;
        with preterm labor. Women who have advanced dilatation, preterm rupture of membranes, etc&#xD;
        are at high risk for having a preterm birth. The investigators anticipate, based on the&#xD;
        number of spontaneous preterm births at HUP per year, enrolling about 40-50% of those&#xD;
        eligible and understanding that about 40% of those enrolled will have a preterm birth, we&#xD;
        should be able to enroll about 112 women per year over 5 years. The coordinators will&#xD;
        enroll cases who are admitted to the hospital with PTL, PPROM, or cervical insufficiency at&#xD;
        20-0/7 to 36-6/7 weeks.&#xD;
