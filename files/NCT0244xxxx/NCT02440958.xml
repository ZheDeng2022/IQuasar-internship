  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is the fourth cause of death in the Western world. Surgery&#xD;
      remains the only treatment offering an advantage in terms of overall survival (5-year&#xD;
      survival range, 15-25%), but unfortunately only 10-20% of patients present resectable disease&#xD;
      at the time of diagnosis. Since the approval of gemcitabine as a standard treatment for&#xD;
      advanced pancreatic patients, no drug or combination of drugs has significantly improved the&#xD;
      prognosis. Recently, as compared with gemcitabine, FOLFIRINOX was associated with a survival&#xD;
      advantage (11.1 vs 6.8 months), but had increased toxicity. In some retrospective studies,&#xD;
      modified FOLFIRINOX regimen (60/120 mg/m2 of oxaliplatin and irinotecan) has an improved&#xD;
      safety profile in digestive malignancies. The purpose of this phase II multicenter study was&#xD;
      to investigate the efficacy and safety in patients with pancreatic cancer who progressed in&#xD;
      gemcitabine-based first line chemotherapy.&#xD;

    <description>Modified FOLFIRINOX regimen consisted of oxaliplatin at a dose of 60 mg per square meter, given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion, after 60 minutes, of irinotecan at a dose of 120 mg per square meter, given as a 90-minute intravenous infusion, immediately followed by leucovorin at a dose of 400 mg per square meter, given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion through a Y-connector. This treatment was immediately followed by fluorouracil at a dose of 400 mg per square meter, administered by intravenous bolus, followed by a continuous intravenous infusion of 2400 mg per square meter over a 46-hour period every 2 weeks</description>
