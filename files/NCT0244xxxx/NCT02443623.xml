      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To vaccinate plasma donors with the ACAM2000 smallpox vaccine thereby inducing an immune&#xD;
           response resulting in high anti-vaccinia antibody titers. The collection of donor plasma&#xD;
           will be used in the manufacturing of Vaccinia Immune Globulin Intravenous (VIGIV).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To ensure the safety of plasma donors vaccinated with ACAM2000 through the&#xD;
           implementation of risk factor screening procedures and the collection of&#xD;
           post-vaccination safety data.&#xD;

      This protocol is being conducted to vaccinate plasma donors with the ACAM2000 smallpox&#xD;
      vaccine thereby inducing an immune response resulting in high anti-vaccinia antibody titers.&#xD;
      The collection of donor plasma will be used in the manufacturing of Vaccinia Immune Globulin&#xD;
      Intravenous (VIGIV). The objective of this protocol is to ensure the safety of plasma donors&#xD;
      vaccinated with ACAM2000 through the implementation of risk factor screening procedures and&#xD;
      the collection of post-vaccination safety data.&#xD;

      vaccination site inspection, unanticipated problems, all adverse events including all&#xD;
      cardiovascular adverse events (symptoms and signs), concomitant medications.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      Assessment for pericarditis/myocarditis, unanticipated problems, unexpected and serious&#xD;

    <description>In this study (VA-008), healthy adult male and female volunteers who meet the requirements for source plasma donors and study entry criteria will be vaccinated with the ACAM2000 smallpox vaccine for collection of plasma to be used in the manufacture of VIGIV. There are possible risks associated with ACAM2000 vaccination. To ensure the safety of plasma donors, risk factor screening procedures and the collection of post-vaccination safety data will be assessed throughout the study.</description>
