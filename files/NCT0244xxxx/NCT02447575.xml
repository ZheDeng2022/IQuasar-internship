    <textblock>
      Metered Dose Inhaler (MDI) and Dry Powdered Inhaler (DPI) are the two most common devices&#xD;
      used to deliver medicine in conditions such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
      disease. It is well-known that most patients do not use correct technique when using a&#xD;
      metered dose inhaler. This leads to poor control of their disease. This study is being done&#xD;
      so the investigators can record the patient using the metered dose inhaler before and after a&#xD;
      short teaching session. This information will be fed into an invitro system (device) to allow&#xD;
      the researchers to study the effect of error on drug delivery. The device being used is the&#xD;
      Rice R3 electronic flowmeter.&#xD;

      Metered Dose Inhaler (MDI) and Dry Powdered Inhaler (DPI) are the two most common platforms&#xD;
      to deliver medicine for patients suffering from Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
      disease, and are used for dispensing both controller and rescue medications. Despite&#xD;
      well-known methods to manage Asthma and COPD, nearly 70-90% of the patients do not display&#xD;
      correct technique in using an inhaler. Poor management and control of the disease due to&#xD;
      inadequate inhaler usage has resulted in rising rates of hospitalizations, making chronic&#xD;
      respiratory diseases among the top five causes of death worldwide. Through this study we aim&#xD;
      to record the technique of MDI usage among Asthma and COPD patient and understand the errors&#xD;
      in their technique. The various parameters of inhaler usage where patients can make an error&#xD;
      are 1. Tidal volume, 2. inspiration flow rate, 3. Inspiration flow volume, 4. Timing of&#xD;
      actuation of inhaler and 5. Breath-holding. The parameters will be recorded by the Cognita R3&#xD;
      electronic flowmeter for each patient and the errors in each MDI usage will be noted. Using&#xD;
      ex-vivo modelling, the patient's MDI technique recorded will be used to study the impact of&#xD;
      errors in technique on efficiency of MDI drug delivery.&#xD;

    <description>This is an observational study, the aim is to record a variety of MDI usage techniques performed by patients. The technique is scored out of 7 for the following 7 steps:&#xD;
Shaking (0 = not shaken, 1 = shaken)&#xD;
Coordination (0 = MDI actuated before inhalation start, 1 = MDI actuated after inhalation start)&#xD;
Flow rate (0 = mean inspiratory flow rate &lt;30L/min or greater than 60L/min, 1 = mean inspiratory flow rate between 30-60L/min)&#xD;
Duration of inhalation (0 = duration of inhalation &lt;3 sec, 1 = duration of inhalation &gt;=3sec)&#xD;
Orientation of inhaler (0 = inhaler not upright = &gt; 30° from the vertical position, 1 = inhaler upright = within 30° from the vertical position)&#xD;
Number of exhalation (0 = exhalation during inhaler use, 1 = no exhalations)&#xD;
Single Actuation (0 = less than 0 or more than 1 inhaler actuation, 1 = exactly 1 inhaler actuation)&#xD;
The total score is a minimum of 0 correct steps if all the steps are incorrect to a maximum of 7 correct steps.</description>

      <desc>The study was a single inhaler use event with placebo medication. The risk of adverse events with less than 4 doses of placebo medication is low. The reporting is based on self-report by the participant on the day of the placebo MDI use. The event is reported if a participant faced and reported an adverse event post MDI use at the clinic/study visit on the day of the study visit.</desc>
