    <textblock>
      This is a questionnaire based study investigating the relationship between the timing of&#xD;
      dietary acid intake toothbrushing and erosive tooth wear. Data will be collected on the&#xD;
      timing, nature, frequency and duration of dietary acid intakes and timing and frequency of&#xD;
      the participants toothbrushing. Signs of the participants erosive tooth wear will then be&#xD;
      recorded&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study group will consist of two cohorts, those presenting with tooth wear and a control&#xD;
      group. Participants will be recruited from the care planning clinic of the Dental Institute&#xD;
      King's College London. Suitable participants meeting the inclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      approached on the clinic, given the patient information sheet and asked to consider&#xD;
      participating. Written consent will be obtained from those accepting the request. An&#xD;
      interviewer-led, previously validated questionnaire will question their frequency and timing&#xD;
      of dietary acid intake, tooth brushing and any habits associated with dietary acid intake.&#xD;
      This will be followed by a Basic Erosive Wear Examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The process will take 7-8 minutes and the participant is free to withdraw at any time&#xD;

    <description>Each tooth will be graded by the extent of the surface which the acid has damaged. The Basic Erosive Wear Examination (BEWE) index will grade tooth wear on the buccal, occlusal and palatal/lingual surfaces of each tooth excluding third molars. This ordinal scale graded tooth wear from 0 to 3 (0 = no wear, 1 = early surface loss, 2 = surface loss &lt; 50% or specific defect, 3 = surface loss &gt; 50%). The worst score in each sextant will be taken to be the sextant score. A cumulative score will be calculated for the mouth by adding each sextant score, which can range from 0-18. A higher score indicates a higher level of erosive tooth wear (worse outcome)</description>
