      Background: platelet concentrate could enhance growth factors (GF) crevicular fluid levels&#xD;
      which might be crucial to proper tissue repair and wound healing. However, the open usually&#xD;
      contaminated nature of periodontal defects could affect negatively GF availability and&#xD;
      activity. To test this assumption, this study was designed to evaluate levels of VEGF and&#xD;
      PDGF-BB in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) during the early stages of healing of localized&#xD;
      intrabony defects treated with platelet rich in growth factor (PRGF) and platelet rich fibrin&#xD;
      (PRF) as compared with xenograft defect filling control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Thirty non-smoking patients with severe chronic periodontitis participated in this&#xD;
      prospective, randomized and single blinded trial. Each patient contributed one interproximal&#xD;
      defect that was randomly assigned to the bone substitute grafting control (n=10) G1,&#xD;
      experimental PRGF (n=10) G2 and PRF (n=10) G3. Plaque index, gingival index, probing depth&#xD;
      (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL) and the intrabony depth of the defect (IBD) were&#xD;
      measured at baseline for patient enrollment. Gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) samples were&#xD;
      collected on days 1 and 3, 7, 14, 21, and 30 days after therapy. The primary outcome variable&#xD;
      was the change in VEGF and PDGF-BB levels for sites treated by PRGF and PRF compared to that&#xD;
      of the xenograft treated cases.&#xD;

      Owing to the lots of challenges that facing the use of recombinant growth factors in&#xD;
      periodontal therapy, it is important to look for an alternative that combine ease of&#xD;
      preparation and physiologic mode of delivery. Platelet concentrate has been developed for&#xD;
      this purpose with many debates about the duration of GF availability in the defect area.&#xD;
      Platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) is a leucocyte- and platelet-rich fibrin biomaterial. This dense&#xD;
      fibrin membrane was claimed to releases high quantities of three main growth factors&#xD;
      (Transforming Growth Factor b-1 (TGFβ-1), platelet derived growth factor AB, PDGF-AB;&#xD;
      vascular endothelial growth factor, VEGF) and an important coagulation matricellular&#xD;
      glycoprotein (thrombospondin-1, TSP-1). It has a natural fibrin framework that can protect&#xD;
      growth factors from proteolysis. It is shown that PRF can release growth factors gradually&#xD;
      and keep their activity to a relatively long period compared with platelet rich plasma (PRP).&#xD;
      Levels of released TGF-1 and PDGF-AB markedly increased and reached the highest amount at day&#xD;
      , then decreased mildly. In contrast, PRP experienced uncontrollable and short-term release&#xD;
      of TGF-1 and PDGF-AB, which reached the highest amount at day 1 and then decreased&#xD;
      rapidly.Clinically, it was found that PRF can improve clinical parameters associated with&#xD;
      human intrabony periodontal defects and BPBM (bovine porous bone mineral) has the ability to&#xD;
      augment effects of PRF in reducing pocket depth, improving clinical attachments levels, and&#xD;
      promoting defect fill. On the other hand studies reported similar PD (probing depth)&#xD;
      reduction, CAL (clinical attachment level) gain, and bone fill at sites treated with PRF or&#xD;
      PRP compared with conventional open flap debridement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparation rich in growth factors (PRGF-Endoret) technology was claimed to circumvent many&#xD;
      of the limitations of other reported platelet-rich preparations. Sodium citrate and calcium&#xD;
      chloride are used as an anticoagulant and a clot activator, respectively. Addition of calcium&#xD;
      chloride promotes the formation of native thrombin, mimicking the physiological clotting&#xD;
      process and enabling a more sustained release of growth factors, which might be crucial to&#xD;
      proper tissue repair and wound healing. Moreover, this procedure obviates immunological&#xD;
      reactions and the risk of disease transmission associated with the use of exogenous bovine&#xD;
      thrombin. Anitua et al reported that PRGF contains a moderately elevated platelet&#xD;
      concentration of ~6x105 platelets, which has been reported to induce the optimal biological&#xD;
      benefit. Lower platelet concentrations can lead to suboptimal effects, whereas higher&#xD;
      concentrations might have an inhibitory effect. PRGF application after extraction improved&#xD;
      the healing process in diabetic patients by accelerating socket closure (epithelialization)&#xD;
      and tissue maturation, proving the association between PRGF use and improved wound healing in&#xD;
      diabetic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study it was proposed that the opened, constantly contaminated nature&#xD;
      periodontal defects could be a source of continuous catabolic bacterial and tissue enzymes&#xD;
      and binding proteins that affect platelet concentrate contained GF availability and activity.&#xD;
      To confirm this assumption, this study was designed to evaluate levels of platelet derived&#xD;
      growth factor - BB (PDGF-BB) and vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) in GCF during&#xD;
      the early stages of healing for sites treated with PRF and PRGF in intrabony periodontal&#xD;
      defects and to correlate GF levels with the clinical findings. This could figure out the&#xD;
      potentials of these 2 commonly used platelet concentrate in the periodontal defects ecology.&#xD;
