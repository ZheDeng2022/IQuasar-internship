    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Radiation can cause the parotid salivary glands to make less saliva (dry mouth). This can&#xD;
      cause problems like infections and tooth decay. Researchers hope a new drug can help people&#xD;
      with dry mouth caused by radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To examine the safety of AAV2hAQP1 gene therapy. To see if the drug increases saliva in&#xD;
      people whose parotid glands have had radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - People at least 18 years of age with a history of radiation therapy for head and neck&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened in 2 visits with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  scans&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  saliva collections&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  sialogram. A substance is injected in the parotid gland and X-rays are taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  non-drug infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IV dose of glycopyrrolate to stop saliva&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;new paragraph&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
      3-day hospital stay: Participants will get the gene infusion. The AAV2hAQP1 will be in a&#xD;
      solution in a syringe. It will be slowly pushed through an opening into the gland inside your&#xD;
      mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10 outpatient visits over 3 years. These may include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  repeats of screening tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  oral and head and neck exams, including a thin scope in the airway&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  small piece of skin taken&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  small piece of parotid tissue taken by either: a small video-scope in the parotid duct&#xD;
           that also takes pictures or by a small needle guided by ultrasound&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  scans. Participants lie in a machine or a scanner The machine may feel close to the body&#xD;
           or face. . For some, a substance will be injected in a vein or put in the mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will keep a diary about how they feel before and after the therapy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The treatment of most head and neck cancer patients includes ionizing radiation (IR).&#xD;
      Salivary glands in the IR field suffer irreversible damage. There is no conventional&#xD;
      treatment available to correct this condition. Our research group has been developing an&#xD;
      adeno-associated virus vector based on the hypothesis that this vector is capable of safely&#xD;
      transferring the human aquaporin-1 (hAQP1) cDNA gene to parotid glands of adult patients with&#xD;
      IR-induced salivary hypofunction, resulting in an elevated salivary output. Human AQP1, the&#xD;
      archetypal water channel, is a plasma membrane protein that facilitates water movement across&#xD;
      lipid bilayers. Minipig studies have shown that the AAV2hAQP1 strategy for restoring salivary&#xD;
      flow to IR-damaged salivary glands is effective without untoward effects after salivary gland&#xD;
      delivery. As a proof of concept that AQP1 would restore saliva flow in a human population, we&#xD;
      recently completed a phase 1 clinical trial (06-D-0206) using an Adenovirus-based vector&#xD;
      encoding AQP1 to a single previously irradiated parotid gland in eleven patients using an&#xD;
      open label, single dose, dose-escalation design. All patients tolerated vector delivery and&#xD;
      study procedures well and positive objective and subjective responses were seen in five&#xD;
      patients, all at doses &lt;5.8 times10(9) vp/gland. At higher doses the patients possibly&#xD;
      initiated an immune response to the vector and no improvement in gland function was observed.&#xD;
      These findings have encouraged us to pursue studies with AAV2 based vectors, which have&#xD;
      demonstrated lower immunogenicity and more stable expression compared with adenoviral&#xD;
      vectors. The purpose of this clinical protocol is to test the safety of AAV2hAQP1, with some&#xD;
      measures of efficacy, in adult patients with established IR-induced parotid gland&#xD;
      hypofunction. The targeted tissue site for the AAV2hAQP1 vector in the proposed study is a&#xD;
      single parotid gland. In this Phase 1 dose-escalation study, safety will be evaluated using&#xD;
      conventional clinical and immunological parameters. The primary outcome measure for&#xD;
      biological efficacy will be parotid gland salivary output.&#xD;
