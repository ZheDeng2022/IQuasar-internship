  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Arizona has created a pilot program for juvenile probationers called Juveniles under&#xD;
      Supervision and Treatment (JUST), which includes swift and certain, but modest responses, to&#xD;
      technical violations of the terms of juvenile probation. JUST targets high- and medium-risk&#xD;
      juvenile probationers and its stated objective is to reduce violations and overall&#xD;
      incarceration of youth in the program. The JUST pilot is being implemented under the&#xD;
      authority of the Arizona Governor's Office for Children, Youth and Families (GOCYF) and the&#xD;
      Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Arizona's Juveniles Under Supervision and Treatment (JUST) Court is a pilot project initiated&#xD;
      by the Arizona Governor's office. It is designed to test whether the principles of Swift,&#xD;
      Certain, and Fair (SCF) Supervision-clear rules, close monitoring, and swift and certain, but&#xD;
      modest, penalties for each violation can succeed when applied to juveniles under community&#xD;
      supervision. The Arizona Administrative Office of the Courts piloted JUST in two counties:&#xD;
      Yavapai and Yuma. The Yuma program was launched in March 2011. The goal of JUST is to (a)&#xD;
      reduce the violation rate so as to reduce the number of petitions filed to revoke probation&#xD;
      (the purpose is to reduce the use of juvenile detention), and (b) reduce recidivism overall.&#xD;
      All juveniles in Yavapai are supervised under JUST (evaluation using an RCT is therefore&#xD;
      unfeasible). JUST in Yuma is now being scaled up, which affords the opportunity for an RCT.&#xD;
      The goal of the RCT is to compare the performance of youth supervised under JUST with those&#xD;
      supervised under probation-as-usual.&#xD;
