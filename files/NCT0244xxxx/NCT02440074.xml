      This trial pretends to validate for clinical use a bioengineered product composed of&#xD;
      mesenchymal stem cells produced by the Instituto de Biologia y Genetica Molecular (IBGM),&#xD;
      Valladolid (MSV, which have already been approved by the Spanish Regulatory Agency for three&#xD;
      previous clinical trials) and a cross-linked matrix of autologous plasma patented by The&#xD;
      Blood and Tissue Bank of Asturias (WO2008/ 119855) for bone maxillary cysts refilling. These&#xD;
      two groups collaborate in the present project with the team of Maxillofacial Surgery of the&#xD;
      Hospital Universitario del RÃ­o Hortega, who leads the clinical trial and deals with the&#xD;
      medical aspects. The proposed trial is based on positive results obtained in previous animal&#xD;
      studies performed by the present multidisciplinary team. A phase I / II clinical trial with&#xD;
      10 patients suffering from bone cysts in the maxillofacial region is proposed. Autologous&#xD;
      mesenchymal stem cells isolated from a bone marrow sample will be seeded in the autologous&#xD;
      plasma matrix and cultivated for 3 weeks. At this time, the cyst will be removed by surgery&#xD;
      and the cavity filled with the protein matrix containing the mesenchymal cells. Follow up&#xD;
      tests will be conducted at 3 weeks, 3 and 6 months following the evolution of the cavity by&#xD;
      panoramic radiography and computerized tomography scan.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The proposed test is based on previous animal experiments with positive results by the&#xD;
      multidisciplinary team applicant, whose results are presented in paragraph 2.6 (group results&#xD;
      Valladolid) and Annex I (group results Oviedo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose phase I-II trial with 10 patients with a common condition and&#xD;
      difficult to solve volumetric regeneration therapies, such as bone cysts in the maxillofacial&#xD;
      region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Autologous mesenchymal cells isolated from a sample obtained from the cancellous bone of the&#xD;
      tuberosity intraoral mandibular later and after expansion, will be conveyed in the matrix of&#xD;
      autologous serum. The total process takes 6-8 weeks. After this time, perform the osteotomy&#xD;
      and enucleation of the cyst under local anesthesia and the residual cavity is filled with&#xD;
      bioimplant containing the MSV-H.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the bioimplant, there will be clinical controls at 2 weeks, 2 and 6 months, to follow&#xD;
      the evolution of regeneration by bone cavity in panoramic radiograph and CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project proposes a novel approach to therapy twice, combining a tissue engineering&#xD;
      protocol (bioimplant) consisting of autologous mesenchymal cells have already been approved&#xD;
      by the unit cell production of Valladolid (MSV-H), and a new protein matrix obtained&#xD;
      autologous serum crosslinked in order to stimulate the regenerative capacity of maxillary&#xD;
      cystic bone defects.&#xD;
