      The proposed study will fill an important gap in the literature by examining, through a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial, the effect of egg consumption on biochemical markers of choline,&#xD;
      vitamin B-12, lipids, and amino acids in young children in a poor rural area of Ecuador.&#xD;
      Children from Cotopaxi Province, Ecuador (n=180) will be randomized into one of two groups:&#xD;
      1) intervention, receiving one egg per day for six months; or 2) control. Baseline and&#xD;
      endline data on socio-economic factors, and child diet, morbidities, and anthropometry will&#xD;
      be collected. Blood will also be drawn from the children at these time points for nutrient&#xD;
      biomarker analyses. Through qualitative research the proposed study will provide insight into&#xD;
      the attitudes, beliefs, and use of eggs by mothers and other caregivers during the&#xD;
      complementary feeding period. The University of San Francisco in Quito (USFQ) will be the&#xD;
      lead field coordinator of the research working in partnership with Washington University in&#xD;
      St. Louis, Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) and University of California, Davis.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1: Test the efficacy daily egg consumption for six months on the macro- and&#xD;
      micronutrient status of young children from an indigenous community in Ecuador.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1a. Measure serum concentration of micronutrient biomarkers: choline; betaine; and vitamin&#xD;
      B12.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. b. Measure serum concentrations of macronutrient biomarkers: lipids (total free and&#xD;
           esterified); and amino acids.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Objective 2: Characterize attitudes, beliefs, and use of eggs during the complementary&#xD;
           feeding period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. a. Describe existing attitudes, beliefs, and use of eggs in young child diets in&#xD;
           Ecuador.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2b. Monitor acceptability and tolerance of daily egg consumption among young children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2c. Assess willingness of caregivers to prepare and give eggs daily to young children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Globally, 165 million children are affected by stunting arising in part from macro- and&#xD;
      micronutrient deficiencies during the complementary feeding period; defined as between 6 and&#xD;
      24 months of age. An estimated 200 million children are not meeting their developmental&#xD;
      potential in part because of poor nutrition and, in particular, nutrient intake inadequacies.&#xD;
      Eggs provide several of these critical nutrients known to be missing in the diets of young&#xD;
      children living in poor countries, yet have been largely underutilized in infant and young&#xD;
      child nutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eggs provide essential fatty acids, proteins, and many critical micronutrients at levels&#xD;
      above or comparable to other animal source foods, but are relatively more affordable. Eggs&#xD;
      are considered a perfect protein source with an amino acid profile against which other&#xD;
      proteins are compared. Eggs are also highly concentrated in choline, an important precursor&#xD;
      for acetylcholine in neurotransmitter synthesis, phospholipids needed for cell-membrane&#xD;
      signaling, and methyl-group donation in the homocysteine production pathway. The evidence for&#xD;
      the adverse consequences of choline deficiencies come largely from animal studies, though&#xD;
      some studies have shown an association between choline or its metabolites and negative health&#xD;
      and development outcomes in children. Only one study has shown that egg consumption among&#xD;
      young children can be improved through counseling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eggs contribute to dietary diversity. They are one of three animal source food groups&#xD;
      together with flesh foods and dairy products, included in the seven food groups used to&#xD;
      assess the indicator of minimum dietary diversity in the WHO Indicators for assessing infant&#xD;
      and young child feeding practices. However, they are underused in the diets of young children&#xD;
      relative to their potential to improve child nutrition, particularly in many African&#xD;
      countries but even in Latin America and the Caribbean. Egg consumption the preceding day&#xD;
      among children 6 to 8.9 months of age was only 7.3%, 15.8% and 22.8% in Africa, Asia and&#xD;
      Latin America, respectively. Among children 12 to 23.9 months of age, consumption increased&#xD;
      to only 13.4% in Africa, 33.0% in Asia and 41.8% in Latin America and the Caribbean.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All evidence to date suggests that eggs are underutilized as complementary foods relative to&#xD;
      their potential to improve young child nutrition and, in particular, levels of key macro and&#xD;
      micronutrients. Research to test the efficacy of dietary egg intakes to improve child&#xD;
      nutrition in developing countries is needed. It is also needed to understand attitudes,&#xD;
      beliefs and use of eggs during the complementary feeding period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance. Despite the potential of eggs to improve young child nutrition, to our&#xD;
      knowledge there have been no randomized controlled trials to test the efficacy of egg&#xD;
      consumption to improve the micronutrient status of young children living in developing&#xD;
      countries and very little evidence from egg-related interventions. There is also very limited&#xD;
      evidence on the attitudes, beliefs, and use of eggs by mothers and other caregivers during&#xD;
      the complementary feeding period. Therefore, the proposed study will fill an important gap in&#xD;
      the literature by examining, through a randomized controlled trial, the effect of egg&#xD;
      consumption on serum concentration of micronutrient biomarkers: B12; choline; and betaine and&#xD;
      macronutrient biomarkers: lipids (total free and esterified); and protein nutrition in young&#xD;
      children in a poor rural area of Ecuador. Through qualitative research the proposed study&#xD;
      will also shed light on the attitudes, beliefs, and use of eggs by mothers and other&#xD;
      caregivers during the complementary feeding period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN &amp; METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      University of San Francisco in Quito (USFQ) will coordinate all field activities. A&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial with a parallel design will be applied. A total of 180&#xD;
      mother-infants pairs enrolled in this study: 90 in the control group; and 90 in the egg&#xD;
      intervention group. Inclusion criteria for all infants include: age 6-8 mo; healthy (no&#xD;
      fever, congenital heart condition, or egg allergy); singleton birth; and not severely&#xD;
      malnourished [weight-for-length z (WLZ) &gt; -3). There will be 180 mothers or if mother is not&#xD;
      available, other caregivers of infants (fathers, grandparents, aunts/uncles, siblings, etc.)&#xD;
      enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants (recruitment, screening, and consent process). Mothers/primary caregivers and&#xD;
      children will be recruited in Pastocalle Parish in Cotopaxi Province of Ecuador, where&#xD;
      formative research was conducted to ensure sufficient numbers of infants in this age&#xD;
      category. There will be a rolling admission process over a one-year period to ensure sample&#xD;
      size is reached, and potentially we will extend recruitment to adjacent parishes.&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited through participatory approaches, with the support of local&#xD;
      leaders and the active involvement of community stakeholders. There will be an initial stage&#xD;
      before recruitment in which the field team will build rapport with caregivers using&#xD;
      standardized techniques. Mothers (or other primary caregivers) will be approached and invited&#xD;
      to participate with their children in the study. Study staff will verbally explain the&#xD;
      rationale for the study, all study procedures and their risks and benefits, and will invite&#xD;
      mothers to participate with their children. Eligibility screening will then occur. Screening&#xD;
      questions posed to the mother/primary caregiver will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How old are you?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What is the child's birthday?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is the child healthy, without fever or congenital heart condition, and not severely&#xD;
           malnourished?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does the child have any reactions to eating to eggs, a rash, hives, difficulty&#xD;
           breathing?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Was the birth of this child a singleton birth; he/she does not have a twin or triplet,&#xD;
           etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the primary caregiver reports that the child is malnourished and/or the child has the&#xD;
      appearance of thinness or other symptoms such as edema, the weight and length of the child&#xD;
      will be measured and the weight-for-length Z score determined from the WHO Growth Standards&#xD;
      (2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mothers or primary caregivers of children will be given a written informed consent statement&#xD;
      in Spanish to read and sign, indicating their consent and consent on behalf of their child.&#xD;
      If the mothers/primary caregiver is less than 18 years of age, informed consent process will&#xD;
      be sought from their parents or guardians. Participants with limited literacy will be offered&#xD;
      the option to have the statement read to them. Caregivers will be invited to ask any&#xD;
      questions about the nature of the study during this time. A potential participant will have&#xD;
      approximately one week to decide whether or not to participate and thus, have the opportunity&#xD;
      to discuss with family and friends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study field procedures. Children will be randomized through a computer-generated number&#xD;
      sequence program to one of two comparison groups in a 1:1 ratio: 1) control; and 2) egg&#xD;
      supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The baseline survey will first be administered to all mothers/primary caregivers in community&#xD;
      centers, health care posts or nurseries on assigned dates. Household level socioeconomic,&#xD;
      demographic, water, hygiene, and sanitation information will be collected. Child dietary&#xD;
      intake data will be collected using a food frequency questionnaire of commonly used&#xD;
      complementary foods, supplemented with targeted questions about child and household egg&#xD;
      consumption patterns. Morbidities will be assessed using a two-week recall, with particular&#xD;
      focus on respiratory infections given its high prevalence in this population and any symptoms&#xD;
      that might be associated with egg allergies. Anthropometric measures of child length and&#xD;
      weight will then be taken using international protocols. Phlebotomists from an experienced&#xD;
      and well-equipped laboratory in Ecuador, NETLAB, will collect 3 ml of blood from children. A&#xD;
      numbing cream will be used for the children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A weekly supply of eggs will be given to the mother in the egg supplementation group with&#xD;
      instructions to give the child one egg per day. Additional messages will be communicated&#xD;
      regarding hygiene practices and egg handling and preparation. Eggs will not require&#xD;
      refrigeration, but will need to be stored in a cool location. Mothers/caregivers from the&#xD;
      control group will be provided vouchers for 6 months of eggs after the completion of the&#xD;
      intervention study. All mothers will receive an attendance card that will track participation&#xD;
      in study events including baseline and endline visits and qualitative assessment as&#xD;
      appropriate. At the completion of the study, all mothers will receive a small personal care&#xD;
      gift (lotion or perfume) in appreciation for their contributions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motivational workshops will periodically be held by the study coordinator and team to receive&#xD;
      feedback from the participants and continue to provide rationale for study participation.&#xD;
      These workshops effectively engage caregivers in the study and can minimize&#xD;
      losses-to-follow-up. As well, regular meetings with community leaders and health workers will&#xD;
      be held to communicate and dialogue about study progress and findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eggs will be purchased locally in Pastocalle and distributed to families on a weekly basis by&#xD;
      the study team. (The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) will potentially support USFQ to&#xD;
      implement a poultry development project that could linked with this study. With technical&#xD;
      support from Ministry of Agriculture extension workers, families from Pastocalle will receive&#xD;
      and raise chickens for laying eggs.) Eggs for this study will be purchased from these&#xD;
      households and an already established project of egg production developed through the Parish&#xD;
      Council to support individuals with disabilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study coordinator and enumerator team will contact mothers/primary caregivers lost to&#xD;
      follow-up by mobile phones, visits, and through family members and friends, in order to&#xD;
      encourage them to return to the study and to collect information about the reasons they have&#xD;
      left the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutrient biomarkers: Nutrient biomarkers assessed for this study will include vitamin B12,&#xD;
      choline, betaine, lipids and amino acids. NETLAB in Quito, Ecuador will be responsible for:&#xD;
      1) collecting the blood samples; 2) processing and completing the extraction process for&#xD;
      choline/betaine, lipids and amino acids; 3) shipping these samples to Washington University&#xD;
      Biomedical Mass Spectrometry Resource Facility; and 4) completing the assay for vitamin B12.&#xD;
      Trained phlebotomists will travel to Pastocalle and surrounding parishes periodically to&#xD;
      collect blood samples (3 mL from each child). The ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)&#xD;
      plasma will be obtained by collecting blood into Vacutainer Tubes marked with participant ID&#xD;
      numbers only. The samples will be placed on ice and transported to the NETLAB facility in&#xD;
      Quito.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples will be processed and the extraction completed for choline, betaine, lipids, and&#xD;
      amino acids. For the choline and betaine analytes, an aliquot of plasma is mixed with&#xD;
      acetonitrile containing d9-choline and d9-betaine. The acetonitrile extracts are centrifuged,&#xD;
      the supernatant is transferred to a micro-centrifuge tube, and dried to completion under&#xD;
      nitrogen gas. The micro-centrifuge tube is labeled with participant ID# and date of&#xD;
      collection. An extraction process is also completed for processing the lipids and amino&#xD;
      acids. These extracted samples will then be shipped on dry ice to Washington University&#xD;
      Biomedical Mass Spectrometry Resource Facility in St. Louis, MO by Globalex shipping company.&#xD;
      The choline and betaine assays will be tested using LC/MS/MS protocol (Appendix 1). The&#xD;
      remaining sample aliquots will be frozen at -80 degrees C. Vitamin B12 will later be tested&#xD;
      using a competitive chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay solid phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative research. Similar qualitative research techniques will be applied here as were&#xD;
      used for Focused Ethnographic Studies (FES). The qualitative method is based on grounded&#xD;
      theory. Grounded theory is a unique form of qualitative analysis in that it has an inductive&#xD;
      orientation for constructing theory out of a systematic analysis of collected data. In-depth&#xD;
      interviews and focus groups will be conducted with mothers, grandmothers, and other&#xD;
      caregivers, as well as local health care providers, community leaders, and egg producers to&#xD;
      understand attitudes, perceptions and use of eggs for young child nutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Structured observations will be conducted in the homesteads of consenting caregivers and&#xD;
      child care centers to examine environmental factors, chicken rearing practices, and&#xD;
      complementary food storage and egg preparation and feeding practices. Additionally, we follow&#xD;
      a combination of three methods for the analysis of collected qualitative data: coding in&#xD;
      three stages; abductive reasoning; and schemes generation. Of these three, the core method is&#xD;
      the coding on three stages. First, open coding identifies the basic concepts in individual&#xD;
      responses. Second, axial coding is developed through the generation of categories and&#xD;
      properties that emerge from the pattern of responses and which produces relations between&#xD;
      categories and properties. Third, selective coding integrates and refines the main topics and&#xD;
      the interrelations between them. Coding will be done by USFQ, with support from investigators&#xD;
      from UCD and PAHO to triangulate for quality control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management. USFQ will be responsible for data management of data collected in Pastocalle&#xD;
      and at NETLAB (with UC-Davis), and Washington University will be responsible for data&#xD;
      generated at the Biomedical Mass Spectrometry Resource Facility. Data entry will be initiated&#xD;
      early and continue throughout the study to minimize errors and increase the likelihood of&#xD;
      accurate and comprehensive reporting. When potential errors or missing data are identified,&#xD;
      managers will inquire with enumerators and caregivers/mothers to either provide appropriate&#xD;
      responses or explanatory notes in the data set. Double data entry will be conducted on a&#xD;
      sub-set of surveys to check for entry error.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and statistical analysis. Sample size was estimated based on hypothesized change&#xD;
      (difference-in-difference with control) in plasma vitamin B12 concentration of 59.4 pmol/L&#xD;
      over the 6 month period based on other previous findings of vitamin B12 supplementation and&#xD;
      the variability in vitamin B12 status among infants. This nutrient was selected for sample&#xD;
      size calculation because sufficient data was available to estimate variability and potential&#xD;
      effects from egg consumption in contrast to the other nutrients that will be studied. We&#xD;
      estimate requiring 90 children per group assuming a 20% attrition rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will first be applied to examine characteristics of the sample, and&#xD;
      the primary and secondary outcomes. Univariate tests, including chi squared and t-tests, will&#xD;
      then be applied to compare characteristics across trial arms and examine cross-sectional&#xD;
      differences in the outcome variables at baseline and endline. Longitudinal modeling for the&#xD;
      primary biomarker outcomes (continuous serum/plasma nutrient concentration markers) and&#xD;
      secondary growth (LAZ, WAZ, WLZ) and morbidity outcomes (days with diarrhea) will be&#xD;
      conducted using generalized least squares (GLS) with random effects. Logit models will be&#xD;
      applied to examine adjusted odds of threshold outcomes (nutrient deficiencies, stunting,&#xD;
      underweight, wasting, respiratory infection, etc.). All inference analyses for the efficacy&#xD;
      of eggs will use intention-to-treat. Quantitative data analyses were performed with STATA&#xD;
      software (version 11.1; StataCorp, College Station, TX).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For qualitative data analyses, interview transcripts will be uploaded into Nvivo10 software&#xD;
      and coded for themes. Top-line themes will be sub-divided into more detailed categories&#xD;
      according to participants' responses in the interviews. Analyses of these categories and&#xD;
      themes reveal patterns in the interview data that form the basis of the qualitative findings.&#xD;
      A framework matrix analysis of a subset of interviews in the two study arms analyzing key&#xD;
      themes will be applied to investigate any systematic differences in responses across study&#xD;
      arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To measure micronutrient intakes against normative levels of adequacy, the full probability&#xD;
      approach will be used. This method allows for a more comprehensive estimate of inadequacy&#xD;
      risk across the entire distribution of intakes when compared to a simple cut-point approach&#xD;
      in which intakes above and below a threshold level are estimated. Child micronutrient intake&#xD;
      will be standardized by subtracting the estimated average requirement (EAR) of the reference&#xD;
      distribution and then dividing by the SD of the reference distribution. The resulting number&#xD;
      will be compared to a standard normal distribution to obtain the probability of inadequacy,&#xD;
      the area to the right under the standard normal curve, and averaged across the sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Profile of the Target Population. The target population for this study will be infants ages&#xD;
      6-8 months old from the Pastocalle Parish, which is populated mainly by indigenous&#xD;
      communities, in Cotopaxi Province of Ecuador. Findings from a national health and nutrition&#xD;
      survey, Encuesta Natcional de Salud y Nutriciόn (ENSANUT-ECU) showed 25.3% of children ages&#xD;
      0-5 years nationally, and 42.3% of indigenous children were stunted (HAZ&lt;-2). Other&#xD;
      indicators from this study further demonstrated the nutritional vulnerabilities of&#xD;
      indigenous, young children in Ecuador. Prevalences of anemia (41.6%), zinc deficiency&#xD;
      (32.4%), and vitamin A deficiency (19.3%) all exceeded national averages and were highest in&#xD;
      the 6-11 mo age category. The ENSANUT-ECU found high levels of nutrient intake inadequacies&#xD;
      in the general population for protein, iron, and zinc. Rice comprises nearly one-third&#xD;
      (32.8%) of energy in the diet, with relatively low levels of animal source foods. USFQ&#xD;
      conducted the Chispaz Study examining the efficacy of a micronutrient powder; this study was&#xD;
      carried out in Pastocalle. Thus, there is already an understanding and appreciation for&#xD;
      research in the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks and Benefits. There are less than minimal risks associated with this study. The risk of&#xD;
      an allergic reaction to eggs is low; expected to be only between 1 to 2% in young children.&#xD;
      The majority of cases are mild consisting of hives soon after consuming eggs. Children with a&#xD;
      known egg allergy will be excluded from the study and any children displaying any symptoms of&#xD;
      an allergic reaction will be referred for treatment and will be excluded from any future&#xD;
      participation in the study. There is a small risk associated with the blood draw for this&#xD;
      study. The study team collecting samples will be well-trained on safe handling of human&#xD;
      biologic specimens and will follow strict hygienic protocols relating to the usage of gloves,&#xD;
      sterile equipment, and alcohol swabs to cleanse the area. A numbing cream is similarly being&#xD;
      explored as an option to minimize pain for the child and psychological distress for the&#xD;
      mother/caregiver. Interviews will be conducted with caregivers in a private setting to&#xD;
      maintain confidentiality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The children will benefit directly through their participation in this study through the&#xD;
      likely improvements in nutritional status via consumption the consumption of eggs, a high&#xD;
      nutritional quality, nutrient-dense food. The study involves a delayed intervention design,&#xD;
      where eventually all participants will have the opportunity to receive the egg intervention.&#xD;
      Thus, all participants have the opportunity to benefit through the receipt of a high quality&#xD;
      food. There are potential benefits to society in terms of knowledge gained regarding a&#xD;
      food-based, sustainable approach to improving young child nutrition. Globally, nutrition&#xD;
      programming and policies have largely relied on the use of single nutrient or multiple&#xD;
      nutrient supplementation, micronutrient powders, or imported processed complementary foods.&#xD;
      This project aims to test a food-based approach, providing nutrients through eggs in a highly&#xD;
      bioavailable matrix appropriate for young children. Further, the eggs are purchased locally&#xD;
      with likely positive implications for economic development in the region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Privacy and confidentiality. The consent, interview, anthropometric measurement, and blood&#xD;
      draw processes will occur at community centers, health care posts or children nurseries -as&#xD;
      the field team may determine the most appropriate location in each district of the parish.&#xD;
      The spaces are sufficiently large to ensure confidentiality. Separate, private space in each&#xD;
      of these settings will be designated for interviews and data collection. Only questions&#xD;
      pertaining to child nutrition will be asked to avoid any unnecessary invasion of privacy.&#xD;
      Additional time will be allocated for each consent and interview process to allow&#xD;
      mothers/primary caregivers to ask additional questions as needed. They are also located in&#xD;
      close proximity to households to facilitate convenient access for mothers and caregivers. In&#xD;
      some cases, the field team will visit directly the participants at home for the purpose above&#xD;
      mentioned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The informed consent form will include mention of the possible use of data and blood samples&#xD;
      for future research, as optional for consent on the part of mothers/caregivers. Two questions&#xD;
      will be included in the baseline survey, the first asking if mothers/caregivers agree that&#xD;
      their data may be used for future research and the second, asking mothers/caregivers if the&#xD;
      blood of the child may be used for future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected on paper forms and will be stored in locked cabinets in the Instituto&#xD;
      de Investigacion en Salud y Nutricion (ISYN) office. All participants will be assigned a&#xD;
      unique identifier that will be written on all study forms. Access to personal identifying&#xD;
      information will be limited among the research investigators to only the PI, the senior&#xD;
      research team, and the field team the purposes of participant follow-up and tracking. Data&#xD;
      will be entered by the study team at USFQ. Encrypted raw data files will be transferred&#xD;
      periodically to Washington University using password protected storage devices or other&#xD;
      electronic data transfer mechanisms. De-identified datasets will be shared with co-PIs. In&#xD;
      Ecuador, the study will be previously approved by the IRB (Comité de Bioética) of the USFQ&#xD;
      and by the Ministry of Public Health.&#xD;
