      Phase II trial of AZD5363 plus paclitaxel / AZD2014 plus paclitaxel in biomarker negative&#xD;
      (PIK3CA/MEK/RAS/TP53/MET) advanced gastric adenocarcinoma patients as second-line&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each arm is composed of 25 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AZD5363 400mg bid 4 days on/ 3 days off of a 7 day cycle for each week that paclitaxel is&#xD;
      given + paclitaxel 80mg/m2 given days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28 day cycle. AZD5363 and paclitaxel&#xD;
      will be received for 3 consecutive weeks, followed by one week off-therapy in 4-week&#xD;
      cycles.If paclitaxel therapy is stopped then AZD5363 can be given on a 4on/3off continuous&#xD;
      schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AZD2014 50mg BD 3 days on 4 days off of a 7 day cycle + paclitaxel 80mg/m2 given days 1, 8&#xD;
      and 15 of a 28 day cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumour evaluation using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 will be conducted at&#xD;
      screening (within 28 days prior to first dose) and every 8 weeks relative to the date of&#xD;
      first dose, up to week 40, then every 16 weeks until objective disease progression (within a&#xD;
      window of +/- 7 days of the scheduled date).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study treatment will be continued until objective disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of AZD5363 plus&#xD;
      paclitaxel in biomarker negative (PIK3CA/MEK/RAS/TP53/MET) advanced gastric adenocarcinoma&#xD;
      patients as second-line chemotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AZD2014 is a selective dual mTOR kinase inhibitor targeting both mTORC1 (rapamycin sensitive)&#xD;
      and mTORC2 (rapamycin insensitive) complexes of mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      AZD2014 is a selective dual mTOR kinase inhibitor targeting both mTORC1 (rapamycin sensitive)&#xD;
      and mTORC2 (rapamycin insensitive) complexes of mammalian Target Of Rapamycin (mTOR) AZD2014&#xD;
      is specific for mTOR and does not inhibit other members of the PI3K superfamily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway functions as a sensor of mitogen, energy and nutrient levels and is&#xD;
      a central controller of cell growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mTOR is a protein kinase (PK) and a vital component of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling&#xD;
      pathway. This pathway is deregulated in 50% of all human cancers and, as such, is an&#xD;
      important target for inhibitors that would alleviate the unregulated proliferation of cancer&#xD;
      cells . AZD2014 is selective inhibitor of mTOR kinases and inhibits signalling of both mTOR&#xD;
      complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the researchers further investigated the effect of PI3K/mTOR inhibitor as a&#xD;
      paclitaxel sensitizer and/or nonspecific targeted therapy in combination with standard&#xD;
      chemotherapy, paclitaxel in patients with pretreated advanced or metastatic gastric cancer&#xD;
      having all negative biomarkers (PIK3CA/MEK/RAS/TP53/MET).&#xD;
&#xD;
      AZD5363 is a highly potent adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-competitive AKT inhibitor with&#xD;
      IC50&lt;10nmol/l for all three AKT isoforms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AZD5363 is a highly potent adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-competitive AKT inhibitor with&#xD;
      IC50&lt;10nmol/l for all three AKT isoforms. AKT pathway is activated in various human&#xD;
      cancers.Although AKT inhibitor has known showing anti-tumor activity in cell lines mutated at&#xD;
      the E542, E545, or H1047 positions in preclinical study, clinical studies with AKT inhibitor&#xD;
      are conducted for non-selected cancer patients.&#xD;
