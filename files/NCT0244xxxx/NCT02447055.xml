  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop a novel platform for allo-SCT in multiple myeloma&#xD;
      (MM) with the idea of maximizing anti-myeloma effect with conditioning and minimizing GvHD&#xD;
      (graft versus host disease). Specifically, the investigators will use the Flu/Mel&#xD;
      (fludarabine and melphalan) regimen. For GvHD prophylaxis, the investigators use the Hopkins&#xD;
      PT-Cy (post-transplant cyclophosphamide) platform with the novelty of adding tocilizumab as&#xD;
      both an anti-myeloma therapy and as a method to reduce GvHD. IL-6 has an important role in&#xD;
      promoting the growth of myeloma cells and progression of disease.&#xD;
