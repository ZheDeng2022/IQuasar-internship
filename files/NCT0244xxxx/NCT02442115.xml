  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinical manifestation of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is complex, with medical and&#xD;
      mental health disruptions that occur with the three core behavioral criteria used for&#xD;
      diagnosis (social behavior, communication, restricted interests/repetitive behavior).&#xD;
      Co-occurring medical conditions, such as gastrointestinal dysfunction (GID), often are&#xD;
      overlooked when designing research strategies to understand the mechanisms underlying the&#xD;
      expression of ASD. This study was initially a collaboration between Children's Hospital Los&#xD;
      Angeles (CHLA) and the Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt University. The current research&#xD;
      project proposes to recruit subject at CHLA and the Center for Autism and Developmental&#xD;
      Disorders (CAND), a Children's Hospital of Orange County and University of California Irvine&#xD;
      (UCI) Health collaborative program. In Aim 1, the investigators will characterize GID in&#xD;
      pediatric populations with ASD. Over a 12 month period, subjects will receive standard of&#xD;
      care for their GID, typically functional constipation. The study population will be&#xD;
      characterized with a standardized instrument for diagnosing functional GI disorders in&#xD;
      children, the Questionnaire on Pediatric Gastrointestinal Symptoms, and with the clinical&#xD;
      acumen of an experienced pediatric gastroenterologist. Nutritional information also will be&#xD;
      collected to determine whether there are patterns of GIDs that correlate with dietary and&#xD;
      nutritional status. The in-depth characterization and treatment of GIDs in children with ASD&#xD;
      will provide a unique way of determining if ASD symptom and GID symptom improvement are&#xD;
      related to each other. In Aim 2, the investigators will do in-depth assessment of each&#xD;
      subjects functional status for social communication, emotional regulation, cognitive&#xD;
      function, speech-language, sensory integration, and a biomarker of oxidative stress. The&#xD;
      latter will be measured in urine samples over the course of one year. There are no direct&#xD;
      interventions for autism symptoms in this study. Rather, subjects will receive standard of&#xD;
      care for the GID diagnosis and secondary effects on ASD symptoms will be evaluated. Our power&#xD;
      calculation shows that the investigators will be adequately powered with the proposed study&#xD;
      design and recruitment targets. As part of the study, the investigators have developed a&#xD;
      collaboration with investigators in the University of Southern California (USC) School of&#xD;
      Engineering, in which the investigators will work with them to develop computational tools to&#xD;
      assist in the characterization of videotaped Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2)&#xD;
      assessments.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Children ages 7 years 0 months to 12 years 11 months will be recruited into 1 clinical group&#xD;
      (ASD+/FC+), utilizing the following clinics in Southern California:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CHLA-affiliated Clinics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Boone-Fetter Clinic, home of the CHLA Autism Treatment Network&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  University Center of Excellence on Developmental Disabilities (UCEDD) Clinic at CHLA -&#xD;
           UC Irvine/Orange County-affiliated clinics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Center for Autism and Neurodevelopmental Disorders in Orange County&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children's Hospital of Orange County Exclusion criteria include a diagnosed syndromic&#xD;
           disorder, prematurity, failure to meet standard birth weight, not enrolled in any ASD&#xD;
           treatment program. For each child, the Questionnaire on Pediatric Gastrointestinal&#xD;
           Symptoms (QPGS)-Rome III is administered and the child is seen by a board-certified&#xD;
           pediatric gastroenterologist. The child will be seen at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months for&#xD;
           their research visits. Treatment of FC in children with ASD is based on the Autism&#xD;
           Treatment Network (ATN) modified protocol of the North American Society for Pediatric&#xD;
           Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) and includes the following: 1) a&#xD;
           thorough dietary history is reviewed and adjusted for introducing a diet rich in fiber&#xD;
           (or supplements if able to be tolerated by the child; typically this will be in older&#xD;
           children in the study); 2) assessment of abdominal pain, perianal skin tags,&#xD;
           hemorrhoids, fissures, rectal exam if needed, frequency of stooling, quality of stool,&#xD;
           rectal bleeding, other possible associated symptoms such as reflux/dyspepsia, vomiting,&#xD;
           headaches, increase or decrease in appetite; 3) behavioral techniques, such as toileting&#xD;
           after meal times, and other strategies are added; and 4) medicine and dietary&#xD;
           adjustments are made. At each visit, the following instruments/questionnaires will be&#xD;
           administered by a clinical psychologist: 1) social responsiveness scale; 2) Kaufman&#xD;
           Brief Intelligence Test; 3) Child Behavior Checklist; 4) Aberrant Behavior Checklist; 5)&#xD;
           Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (Peds QL); 6) Repetitive Behavioral Scale-Revised;&#xD;
           7) Autism Impact Measure; 8) Pearson Short Sensory Profile. The Vineland will be&#xD;
           administered at baseline and 12 months. The ADOS-2 will be used at baseline to ensure an&#xD;
           ASD diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each visit, subject urine is collected and stored until an assay for the oxidative stress&#xD;
      marker F2-isoprostane is measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A buccal swab is collected and DNA extracted for future genetic studies.&#xD;
