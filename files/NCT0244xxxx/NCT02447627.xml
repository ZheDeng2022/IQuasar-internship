  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether imaging techniques, such as magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI), near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), laser speckle contrast imaging&#xD;
      (LSCI), and optical imaging (OI), can detect differences in blood flow and oxygen levels in&#xD;
      different organ systems of participants with sickle cell disease (SCD). Differences in blood&#xD;
      flow and oxygen levels detected by these techniques will be evaluated to determine their&#xD;
      utility as biomarkers of clinical disease pathophysiology.&#xD;

        Key Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Have a diagnosis of SCD confirmed by hemoglobin analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Be in stable clinical condition, as determined by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Subjects enrolled in Part B must also meet the following eligibility criterion at&#xD;
             Screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Receiving scheduled standard of care RBC exchange transfusion therapy, with ≥3&#xD;
             transfusions already received.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Be deemed healthy, as determined by the Investigator, based on the physical&#xD;
             examination, medical history, vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), and&#xD;
             clinical laboratory measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Key Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Inability to lie still for ≥5 minutes, claustrophobia sufficient to interfere with&#xD;
             generating reliable MRI scans, body weight exceeding 320.0 lbs., or girth exceeding&#xD;
             the magnet bore.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Presence of a metal device affected by MRI (e.g., any type of electronic, mechanical&#xD;
             or magnetic implant, cardiac pacemaker, aneurysm clips, implanted cardiac&#xD;
             defibrillator) or potential ferromagnetic foreign body (metal slivers, metal shavings,&#xD;
             other metal objects) which would be a contraindication for MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Acute pain crisis requiring hospitalization, with a discharge ≤4 weeks prior to the&#xD;
             first imaging visit, or when determined by the Investigator to not be at steady state.&#xD;
