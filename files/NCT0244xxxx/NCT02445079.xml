      Longitudinal cohort study of older-aged people living with HIV infection in southwestern&#xD;
      Uganda and age and gender-matched HIV uninfected controls with the primary aim of measuring&#xD;
      the epidemiology of cardiovascular and pulmonary disease in this study setting, and&#xD;
      particularly the contribution of HIV infection to it.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study recruits people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH) aged 40 and older; and an&#xD;
      HIV-uninfected age and gender-matched, community-based comparison group in the HIV clinic&#xD;
      catchment area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study investigators will collect sociodemographic, clinical, immune activation, systemic&#xD;
      inflammation, plasma and stool microbiome, and clinical pulmonary and cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      measures. Our outcomes of interest are measures of carotid atherosclerosis, including carotid&#xD;
      intima media thickness and presence of plaque, prior ischemic heart disease (as measured by&#xD;
      electrocardiograms), peripheral arterial disease (as measured by ankle-branchial index), and&#xD;
      lung function as measured by pulmonary function testing. Our exposures of interest are&#xD;
      traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors (e.g. age, gender, family history of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease, smoking history, diet, activity, body mass index, prevalence of&#xD;
      diabetes, and prevalence of hypertension) and HIV-related cardiovascular risk factors (e.g.&#xD;
      nadir CD4 count, ART duration and regimen, gut and plasma microbiome composition, and markers&#xD;
      of both immune activation and systemic inflammation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will collect this data to accomplish the following aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Compare the prevalence of atherosclerosis, measured by cIMT, ankle-brachial index, and&#xD;
      presence of q-waves on electrocardiogram, in PLWH taking ART aged 40 and older and age and&#xD;
      gender-matched, population-based HIV-uninfected controls. This study aims to be among the&#xD;
      first to capture high-quality measures of atherosclerotic disease among a population of PLWH&#xD;
      in sub-Saharan Africa. The study aims to test the hypothesis that older-age Ugandans on ART&#xD;
      will have thicker carotid intima media, higher prevalence of peripheral arterial disease, and&#xD;
      higher prevalence of pathologic q-waves on electrocardiogram than age and gender-matched,&#xD;
      HIV-uninfected controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Evaluate correlates of atherosclerosis in older-age PLWH on ART, including both&#xD;
      traditional (age, gender, smoking, diabetes and hypertension prevalence) and HIV-related risk&#xD;
      factors (immune activation, systemic inflammation, and stool and plasma microbiome&#xD;
      composition). The study will leverage a collaboration with the Ragon Institute to perform&#xD;
      immunologic and molecular testing for microbial translocation and markers of immune&#xD;
      activation and systemic inflammation (e.g. soluble CD163, C-reactive protein, IL-6, CD8+&#xD;
      T-lymphocyte activation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Compare the progression of atherosclerosis in PLWH versus HIV-uninfected individuals&#xD;
      over five years of observation time. The study aims to test the hypothesis that the rate of&#xD;
      change in carotid intima media thickness will be faster in among PLWH over 45 on ART than age&#xD;
      and gender-matched HIV-uninfected controls, and that rates of change in carotid intima media&#xD;
      thickness among the HIV-infected cohort will be associated with markers of microbial&#xD;
      translocation, immune activation, and systemic inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4: Compare the prevalence and incidence of abnormal pulmonary function (FEV1, FVC,&#xD;
      FEV1/FVC) in PLWH on ART and age- and gender-matched, population-based HIV-uninfected&#xD;
      controls, utilizing handheld spirometry with bronchodilator challenge. The study aims to test&#xD;
      the hypothesis that pulmonary function is worse and COPD is more common among people living&#xD;
      with HIV/AIDS than age- and gender-match HIV-uninfected controls.&#xD;
