      The iLink Study examines whether a Conditional Economic Incentive (CEI) may be an effective&#xD;
      tool for improving linkage to HIV treatment and care following referral for antiretroviral&#xD;
      therapy (ART) services from a mobile health clinic in Cape Town, South Africa. The study&#xD;
      examines the feasibility and acceptability of using a R300 (approximately $25 as of April&#xD;
      2015) voucher - that is exchanged for cash upon initiation of ART within 3 months - to&#xD;
      increase the uptake of ART among men and women living in low-income areas. This pilot study&#xD;
      (n=64) includes a randomised control trial, follow-up telephone calls and medical record&#xD;
      reviews, and in-depth interviews.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The initiation of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) remains a serious challenge&#xD;
      globally, and particularly in South Africa, the country with the largest population of people&#xD;
      living with HIV worldwide (UNAIDS 2012). South Africa has the largest ART programme globally,&#xD;
      yet only half of those needing ART in South Africa were receiving treatment in 2011 (Johnson&#xD;
      2012). Early initiation of ART improves treatment outcomes and reduces AIDS-related morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality. Recent studies have demonstrated a secondary benefit of ART in preventing HIV&#xD;
      transmission by reducing viral load and thus transmissibility (Cohen et al. 2011; Montaner et&#xD;
      al. 2010; Tanser et al. 2013). Despite the personal and public health benefits of ART, South&#xD;
      African studies have shown large loss to follow-up at each of the stages required for ART&#xD;
      initiation: (1) initial CD4 count testing and returning for results; (2) attending ART&#xD;
      readiness counselling; and (3) returning to initiate ART (April et al. 2009; Bassett et al.&#xD;
      2010; Kranzer et al. 2010; Larson et al. 2010; Losina et al. 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Novel interventions are urgently needed to improve linkage to HIV treatment and care&#xD;
      post-diagnosis, as increased ART coverage will reduce AIDS-related morbidity and mortality,&#xD;
      and HIV incidence. Improving ART coverage is therefore a priority in many regions of the&#xD;
      world, and particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where AIDS remains a key development&#xD;
      challenge. Interventions based on theories from the field of behavioural economics, a hybrid&#xD;
      of principles from psychology and economics (Bickel et al. 1995), have great potential to&#xD;
      help strengthen the contributions of psychology to improving ART outcomes. Conditional&#xD;
      economic incentives (CEIs), a financial incentive given upon completion of an outcome that&#xD;
      can be objectively measured (i.e. ART initiation), has the potential to leverage two&#xD;
      theoretical principles from behavioural economics to improve ART initiation. First, instead&#xD;
      of being completely rational and accurate, decision-making is viewed as inherently biased due&#xD;
      to a multitude of social-cognitive and affective factors that play a role in cost-benefit&#xD;
      analysis, such as emotions, personal beliefs, and contextual factors (Fiske &amp; Taylor 2008).&#xD;
      In other words, people's preferred outcomes are largely determined by salient contextual&#xD;
      needs (Operario et al. 2013). Second, people have a tendency to give greater value to rewards&#xD;
      in the present or near future than those in the more distant future (a phenomenon economists&#xD;
      term temporal discounting) and therefore decision-making favours immediate rewards and&#xD;
      heavily discounts future outcomes. This poses a challenge for ART initiation as the future&#xD;
      benefits of ART may be valued less than an individual's more immediate needs, especially for&#xD;
      individuals who currently perceive themselves to be relatively healthy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A CEI may help overcome this challenge for ART initiation by increasing its immediate&#xD;
      benefits. A CEI may therefore help 'nudge' individuals to initiate ART by altering the&#xD;
      cost-benefit ratio so that the benefits of ART (i.e. the immediate financial reward and the&#xD;
      future health reward) outweigh the immediate costs of ART initiation, such as transport, time&#xD;
      off work, long waiting lines and the fear of stigma. The application of CEIs to address HIV&#xD;
      prevention and treatment problems is still in its infancy, but they have been successfully&#xD;
      employed to improve adherence to ART (Rosen et al. 2007; Sorensen et al. 2007; Javanbakht et&#xD;
      al. 2010), increase HIV testing uptake and the collection of HIV tests results (Thornton&#xD;
      2008), and reduce risky sexual behaviours (Baird et al. 2012). This evidence indicates that&#xD;
      small incentives-based interventions can 'nudge' individuals towards adopting healthier&#xD;
      behaviours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed research will make a significant contribution to our knowledge about demand&#xD;
      creation for HIV treatment and prevention services by examining whether CEIs may also be an&#xD;
      effective tool for improving linkage to HIV treatment and care following referral for ART&#xD;
      services. The proposed research will examine the feasibility and acceptability of using CEIs&#xD;
      to increase the uptake of ART among men and women who are referred for ART services. Our&#xD;
      long-term collaborative goal is to utilize the results from this pilot study to prepare a&#xD;
      grant application for a fully-powered RCT examining whether CEIs can increase ART initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives To examine the acceptability and feasibility of an incentive intervention aimed at&#xD;
      increasing uptake of ART among men and women who are referred for ART (CD4 &lt; 500 or WHO stage&#xD;
      4) by a mobile health clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acceptability&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Did participants find the randomization process fair and acceptable?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Was the intervention an incentive that motivated or encouraged uptake of ART?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Was the incentive amount and type acceptable?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Were individuals in the control arm discouraged from ART initiation because they felt&#xD;
           that their linkage to care efforts were not rewarded?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Were there cases of patients who were unsatisfied or disappointed as a consequence of&#xD;
           the study (eg. they did not receive the incentive, yet they thought they should)?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is it possible to recruit men and women into the study on the day of being referred for&#xD;
           ART?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is it possible to track individuals and recruit individuals for in-depth interviews?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is it possible to implement the study as planned:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Did the randomization process work?&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Did participants understand the incentive system?&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Did participants believe that they would actually receive the incentive?&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Did the incentive delivery method work?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What is the potential for individuals to game the incentive system? Did any individuals&#xD;
           find a method of receiving the money without starting ART?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Efficacy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is ART initiation more likely among men and women who are offered the incentive compared&#xD;
           to men and women who are not offered the incentive?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is early ART initiation more likely among men and women who are offered the incentive&#xD;
           compared to men and women who are not offered the incentive?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does retention in care after ART initiation differ among men and women who are offered&#xD;
           the incentive compared to men and women not offered the incentive?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What is the potential for incentives to improve ART initiation given participants&#xD;
           behavioural intentions regarding ART initiation and barriers to ART initiation?&#xD;
