  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-part study of pembrolizumab monotherapy in participants with metastatic&#xD;
      triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC). Part 1 of the study will examine the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of pembrolizumab monotherapy as first line or above treatment in participants who have&#xD;
      received either no prior systemic treatment or at least one prior systemic treatment for&#xD;
      metastatic breast cancer. Part 2 of the study, if done, will expand the investigation of&#xD;
      pembrolizumab treatment in a subgroup of participants from Part 1 and will only start after&#xD;
      enrollment in Part 1 has been completed. There will be no hypothesis testing in this study.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Qualified participants who complete up to ~2 years of pembrolizumab treatment but progress&#xD;
      after discontinuation may be eligible for a second course of pembrolizumab for up to ~1&#xD;
      additional year, at the Investigator's discretion. Per protocol, response or progression&#xD;
      during this second course will not count towards efficacy outcome measure and adverse events&#xD;
      during this second course will not count towards safety outcome measures.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Up to ~28 months (through pre-specified statistical analysis cut-off date of 10-Nov-2017)</time_frame>
    <description>ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who had a Complete Response (CR: disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: ≥30% decrease in sum of diameters [SOD] of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1 by CIV. ORR was estimated by Agresti-Coull (A-C) method. The percentage of participants who had CR or PR is reported here as the protocol-specified ORR, for the first pembrolizumab course, assessed from enrolment/treatment initiation and analyzed by Cohort, for all participants in Cohort A. Per protocol final ORR analysis in all Cohort A participants was done at the time of final statistical efficacy analysis, with a 10-November (Nov)-2017 cutoff. Per protocol ORR per RECIST 1.1 by CIV in all Cohort A participants was planned and conducted as a pre-specified primary outcome analysis. Per protocol ORR per RECIST 1.1 by CIV in all Cohort B participants was analyzed separately as a pre-specified secondary outcome analysis and reported later in the record.</description>

    <description>ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who had a CR (disappearance of all target lesions) or a PR (≥30% decrease in SOD of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1 by CIV.

The percentage of participants who had CR or PR is reported here as the protocol-specified ORR, for the first pembrolizumab course, assessed from enrolment/treatment initiation and analyzed by Cohort for the subgroup of Cohort A participants with tumor immunohistochemistry (IHC) defined-PD-L1 positive expression (PD-L1+). Per protocol final ORR analysis in the Cohort A PD-L1+ subgroup was done at the time of final statistical efficacy analysis with a 10-Nov-2017 cutoff. Per protocol all Cohort B participants were PD-L1+ and ORR per RECIST 1.1 by CIV in all Cohort B participants was analyzed separately as a pre-specified secondary outcome analysis and reported later in the record.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Experienced at Least One Adverse Event (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to ~31 months</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening of a pre-existing condition that is temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product is also an AE. Per protocol the number of participants who experienced at least one AE, for the first pembrolizumab course, was assessed from enrollment/treatment initiation of a participant and analyzed by Cohort and is reported here for all participants in Cohort A and Cohort B who received ≥1 dose of study drug.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to ~28 months (through pre-specified statistical analysis cut-off date of 10-Nov-2017)</time_frame>
    <description>OR comprises CR (disappearance of all target lesions) or PR (≥30% target lesion SOD decrease) per RECIST 1.1 by CIV. PD-L1 expression is assessed by IHC-defined combined positive score (CPS). Association between (b/w) PD-L1 CPS and OR was assessed by odds ratio using a logistic regression model and was calculated as ratio of odds of OR per unit CPS increase in a single arm (odds ratio=1: no association; odds ratio&lt;1: negative association [increase in CPS lowers odds of OR]; odds ratio &gt;1: positive association [increase in CPS raises odds of OR]). Per protocol odds ratio, for the first pembrolizumab course, assessed from enrolment/treatment initiation and analyzed by Cohort is reported here in a single arm of Cohort A participants with PD-L1 CPS available. Per protocol odds ratio was analyzed at the time of final statistical efficacy analysis with a 10-Nov-2017 cutoff. Per protocol odds ratio of association b/w PD-L1 expression and OR was not planned or done in Cohort B participants.</description>

        <title>Objective Response Rate (ORR) Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) by Central Imaging Vendor (CIV) in All Cohort A Participants</title>
        <description>ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who had a Complete Response (CR: disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: ≥30% decrease in sum of diameters [SOD] of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1 by CIV. ORR was estimated by Agresti-Coull (A-C) method. The percentage of participants who had CR or PR is reported here as the protocol-specified ORR, for the first pembrolizumab course, assessed from enrolment/treatment initiation and analyzed by Cohort, for all participants in Cohort A. Per protocol final ORR analysis in all Cohort A participants was done at the time of final statistical efficacy analysis, with a 10-November (Nov)-2017 cutoff. Per protocol ORR per RECIST 1.1 by CIV in all Cohort A participants was planned and conducted as a pre-specified primary outcome analysis. Per protocol ORR per RECIST 1.1 by CIV in all Cohort B participants was analyzed separately as a pre-specified secondary outcome analysis and reported later in the record.</description>

        <description>OR comprises CR (disappearance of all target lesions) or PR (≥30% target lesion SOD decrease) per RECIST 1.1 by CIV. PD-L1 expression is assessed by IHC-defined combined positive score (CPS).

Per protocol odds ratio, for the first pembrolizumab course, assessed from enrolment/treatment initiation and analyzed by Cohort is reported here in a single arm of Cohort A participants with PD-L1 CPS available. Per protocol odds ratio was analyzed at the time of final statistical efficacy analysis with a 10-Nov-2017 cutoff.
