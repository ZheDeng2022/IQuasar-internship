  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess brain and memory changes in patients with uncontrolled&#xD;
      diabetes (a condition called diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA))&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a common and serious medical problem. Most cases occur when&#xD;
      patients forget or stop insulin injections. Some patients require frequent admissions to the&#xD;
      hospital with DKA after stopping insulin. Many patients do not know why they stop insulin&#xD;
      therapy. The investigators will test if patients with one or more episodes of DKA have poor&#xD;
      memory and brain changes that may lead to poor management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will perform memory testing and brain images in subjects&#xD;
      with initial DKA episode and subjects with more than 3 episodes of DKA. The results will be&#xD;
      compared to subjects with diabetes and no history of DKA and healthy (non-diabetic) subjects.&#xD;
      Each subject with DKA will have an MRI and cognitive testing done shortly after hospital&#xD;
      discharge, 1 month, and 3 months after hospital discharge. Diabetic subjects without DKA and&#xD;
      healthy controls will only come in for a single baseline visit and have a MRI and cognitive&#xD;
      testing done.&#xD;

        Subjects with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) will be recruited from Emory University Hospital&#xD;
        and Grady Memorial Hospital patients when DKA is treated. Diabetic subjects and age-matched&#xD;
        controls will be recruited from physician referrals.&#xD;
