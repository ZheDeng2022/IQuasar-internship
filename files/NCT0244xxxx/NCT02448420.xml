  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PATRICIA is a phase II, open-label, multicentre, Simon's two-stage-design study of the&#xD;
      combination of palbociclib plus trastuzumab, with or without letrozole, in post-menopausal&#xD;
      patients with HER2-positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (MBC) who have&#xD;
      received chemotherapy and treatment with trastuzumab for their metastatic disease. Cohorts A,&#xD;
      B1, and B2 based on their HR status and treatment allocation were planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort A included patients with hormone receptor-negative, HER2 positive breast cancer, who&#xD;
      received trastuzumab + palbociclib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort B1 included patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2 positive breast cancer, who&#xD;
      received trastuzumab + palbociclib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort B2 included patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2 positive breast cancer, who&#xD;
      received trastuzumab + palbociclib + letrozole.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the PATRICIA study is to test the hypothesis that the addition of Palbociclib to&#xD;
      standard therapy is well tolerated and can provide a benefit in progression-free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on interim results from this trial that support the benefit of CDK4 / 6 inhibition in&#xD;
      luminal disease, two additional cohorts will be included.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After the amendment of PATRICIA study, two additional cohorts will be included:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort C1: will include patients with OR+, HER2 positive, Luminal intrinsic subtype&#xD;
           determined by PAM50 who will receive trastuzumab + palbociclib + endocrine therapy (ET)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort C2: will include patients with OR+, HER2 positive, Luminal intrinsic subtype&#xD;
           determined by PAM50 who will receive treatment of physician's choice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the recruitment of those cohorts C begins, the recruitment in cohorts A and B will be&#xD;
      closed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For cohorts C, an adaptive design will be applied to compare arms of treatment in patients&#xD;
      with Luminal subtype locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (MBC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients in those cohorts will have histologically- confirmed HR+/HER2-positive and&#xD;
      PAM50-confirmed Luminal intrinsic subtype breast adenocarcinoma, and must have received at&#xD;
      least 1 (and no more than 4) previous lines of anti-HER2 regimens for locally advanced&#xD;
      disease or MBC (including prior treatment with a taxane, trastuzumab and Antibody-Drug&#xD;
      conjugate).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stratification factors will include number of previous regimens for advanced breast cancer&#xD;
      (one and two vs three and four) and presence of visceral disease (yes vs no).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment in all cohorts will be administered until progression, unacceptable toxicity,&#xD;
      patient consent withdrawal, or death 516 patients will be screened and a total of 232&#xD;
      patients will be included. The inclusion period will be divided in two phases. During phase I&#xD;
      it is planned to include 60 patients in 24 months; considering early stopping rule according&#xD;
      to SF rate. During phase II, the trial will continue until the final evaluable number of&#xD;
      patients are included.&#xD;

    <description>The FACT-B consists of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) (27-items) and a breast-specific module: a 10-item instrument designed to assess patient concernsrelating to BC. The FACT-G is a 27-item compilation of general questions divided into 4 domains: Physical Well-Being, Social/Family Well-Being, Emotional Well-Being, and Functional Well-Being. Patients are asked to respond to a Likert scale where 0=not at all, 1=a little bit, 2=somewhat, 3=quite a bit, and 4=very much.</description>

    <description>The EuroQol EQ-5D is designed to assess health status in terms of a single index value or utility score.

The scores on the 5 descriptors are summarized to create a single summary score. The EQ-5D also includes a visual analog scale (VAS), in which the patients self-rate their overall health status on a scale from 0 (worst imaginable) to 100 (best imaginable).</description>
