    <textblock>
      This randomized phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of pembrolizumab when&#xD;
      given together with stereotactic body radiation therapy or non-stereotactic wide-field&#xD;
      radiation therapy (conventional radiation therapy) and to see how well they work in treating&#xD;
      patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as&#xD;
      pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with&#xD;
      the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to&#xD;
      kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Stereotactic body radiation therapy uses special&#xD;
      equipment to position a patient and deliver radiation to tumors with high precision. This&#xD;
      method can kill tumor cells with fewer doses over a shorter period and cause less damage to&#xD;
      normal tissue. Giving pembrolizumab together with radiation therapy may kill more tumor&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and toxicity profile of intravenous MK-3475 (pembrolizumab)&#xD;
      administered in combination with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) targeting 1-4&#xD;
      liver or thoracic lesion(s) in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).&#xD;
      (Phase I) II. To evaluate the safety and toxicity profile of intravenous MK-3475 administered&#xD;
      in combination with non-stereotactic wide-field radiation therapy (WFRT) targeting 1-4 liver&#xD;
      or thoracic lesion(s) in patients with metastatic NSCLC. (Phase I) III. To determine the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) of MK-3475 and SBRT&#xD;
      combination therapy. (Phase I) IV. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose&#xD;
      limiting toxicities (DLTs) of MK-3475 and WFRT combination therapy. (Phase I) V. To determine&#xD;
      the rate of out-of-field objective responses (either complete response [CR] or partial&#xD;
      response [PR]) of the non-irradiated disease sites. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine whether the addition of radiation therapy (XRT) to MK-3475 can improve the&#xD;
      progression free survival (PFS) rate compared to MK-3475 alone. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of pembrolizumab followed by a phase II&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE I: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP I: Patients who exhibit a lung lesion of size and location amenable to SBRT receive&#xD;
      pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Patients also receive SBRT in 4&#xD;
      fractions daily on days 2-5 or either intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), proton&#xD;
      beam radiation therapy (PBRT), or 3 dimensional conformation radiation therapy (3D-CRT) in 15&#xD;
      fractions total concurrent with pembrolizumab administration on days 1-19. Treatment repeats&#xD;
      every 21 days for up to 16 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP II: Patients who exhibit a lung lesion of size or location not amenable to SBRT, but&#xD;
      amenable to WFRT receive pembrolizumab as in Group I and either IMRT, PBRT, or 3D-CRT in 15&#xD;
      fractions total concurrent with pembrolizumab administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE II: Patients for whom SBRT is recommended are randomized to Group 1 or 2, patients for&#xD;
      whom conventional radiation therapy is recommended are randomized to Group 3 or 4, and&#xD;
      patients with lesions amenable to SBRT or WFRT are assigned to Group 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP I: Patients who exhibit a lung lesion with size and location amenable to SBRT receive&#xD;
      pembrolizumab IV on day 1 and SBRT on days 44-47 or IMRT, PBT, or 3D-CRT on days 43-61.&#xD;
      Treatment with pembrolizumab repeats every 21 days for up to 16 courses in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP II: Patients who exhibit a lung lesion with size and location amenable to SBRT receive&#xD;
      pembrolizumab IV as in Group I without XRT. At the first planned efficacy evaluation (5&#xD;
      weeks), patients exhibiting progressive disease (PD) are treated with SBRT concurrent with&#xD;
      the remaining cycles of pembrolizumab. In the event that lesion size has progressed to the&#xD;
      point where the attending physician no longer considers SBRT safe, then the patient will be&#xD;
      salvaged with IMRT, PBRT, or 3D-CRT and analyzed as part of the fourth treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP III: Patients who exhibit a lung lesion with size and location not amenable to SBRT,&#xD;
      but amenable to WFRT receive pembrolizumab IV as in Group I and IMRT, PBRT, or 3D-CRT on days&#xD;
      43-61.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP IV: Patients who exhibit a lung lesion with size and location not amenable to SBRT, but&#xD;
      amenable to WFRT receive pembrolizumab IV as in Group I without XRT. The decision on when to&#xD;
      start XRT will be assessed first at week 5 (after the second dose of pembrolizumab). If a&#xD;
      patient has PD based on immune response related criteria (irRC) then XRT will be delivered&#xD;
      after the third dose of pembrolizumab, while patients with stable disease (SD) or PR will not&#xD;
      start XRT and will continue to be followed. These patients will then have follow up computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT) scans 5 weeks after course 3 three and then approximately every 3 months for&#xD;
      the remainder of the trial; any patient at this point with PD will then have XRT delivered&#xD;
      with the sixth dose of pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP V: Patients with lesions amenable to SBRT or WFRT receive pembrolizumab IV as in Group&#xD;
      I. Patients also receive either IMRT, PBRT, or 3D-CRT in 15 fractions to the primary lesions&#xD;
      and low dose radiation therapy to other lesions on days 43-61 or SBRT in 4 fractions to&#xD;
      primary lesions and low dose radiation therapy to other lesions on days 44-47.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 12&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
