  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our primary aim is to assess the feasibility of initiating treatment in the ED with&#xD;
      extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) plus care management (CM) vs. standard care and&#xD;
      continuing care in cooperation with clinic providers as well as how best to assess outcomes.&#xD;
      Secondarily, the investigators will explore its effect on various health outcomes (healthcare&#xD;
      utilization and engagement, expenditures, drinking and consequences, quality of life) as well&#xD;
      as the association of patient-level characteristics (e.g. sex, race, baseline drinking,&#xD;
      health and psychosocial factors, mu opioid receptor genotype) with effectiveness. Determining&#xD;
      both how to implement XR-NTX+CM and rigorously test its effects in the ED (phase 1) is&#xD;
      essential before planning a large-scale effectiveness trial (phase 2).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aim #1: To conduct a feasibility and acceptability study of XR-NTX+CM treatment in alcohol&#xD;
      dependent patients with frequent ED use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Enrollment of a limited number of subjects will allow identification of optimal&#xD;
      processes for a definitive trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim #2: To conduct an analysis of the effect of this intervention on healthcare utilization&#xD;
      and engagement, drinking outcomes, quality of life, and consequences of drinking (initial&#xD;
      analysis will be exploratory).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Measuring changes in healthcare utilization, drinking metrics, and indicators of&#xD;
      quality of life and consequences will provide preliminary data on intervention effect size on&#xD;
      various outcomes of interest to inform the second phase, definitive trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim #3: To identify patient-level characteristics associated with effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Exploratory analysis of patient and system-level characteristics possibly&#xD;
      associated with effectiveness will inform treatment choice to maximize the probability of&#xD;
      successful outcome. Factors assessed will include data collected in ongoing investigations of&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy for alcohol dependence, including mu opioid receptor (OPRM1) genotypes, to&#xD;
      facilitate comparison across study populations and settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This a phase IV, randomized, open-label, non-placebo-controlled, single-center study of the&#xD;
      feasibility, acceptability, and effect of initiating treatment in the ED with&#xD;
      extended-release naltrexone 380mg intramuscular injection compared to standard care in&#xD;
      subjects with severe alcohol use disorders (i.e. alcohol dependence) and frequent emergency&#xD;
      department use. In the first two years, we will finalize study preparations, recruit and&#xD;
      randomize 50 subjects for the pilot phase of this study. The duration of each subject's&#xD;
      participation will be 12 months. Thereafter, in the second phase of study, we will enroll an&#xD;
      additional 250 subjects (for a total of 300 subjects) to address remaining feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability concerns and test effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study investigators (PI and RA) will collect process data, including barriers and&#xD;
      facilitators encountered in the completion of all study procedures. For the following study&#xD;
      procedures, study investigators (the PI and RAs) will enter data directly into New York&#xD;
      University Langone Medical Center (NYULMC) internal REDCap system for use on portable tablet&#xD;
      computers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Synopsis of Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following study procedures are described in greater detail elsewhere in this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be prescreened for potential eligibility and added to an automated alert system&#xD;
      linked to ED registration by Bellevue Care Managers as part of an ongoing quality improvement&#xD;
      initiative. When a potentially eligible patient presents to the ED, an automated page will be&#xD;
      delivered to the study PI and Bellevue ED social work and care management staff, prompting&#xD;
      consultation and potential referral of the patient to study investigators (PI/RA) for&#xD;
      recruitment (See 4.3 Subject Recruitment and Screening). ED medical providers (inclusive of&#xD;
      ED physicians, nurses, social workers, and care managers) will notify study investigators&#xD;
      (PI/RA) when potentially eligible patients are present in the ED. The medical provider will&#xD;
      introduce the PI/RA to clinically sober and medically stable patients who have given their&#xD;
      permission to be approached. The PI/RA will describe the study, confirm capacity to consent&#xD;
      using the University of California San Diego Brief Assessment of Capacity to Consent to&#xD;
      Research (UBACC), and obtain written informed consent. The PI/RA will confirm eligibility by&#xD;
      performing a chart and laboratory review (liver enzymes, pregnancy, urine drug screen),&#xD;
      history and examination, and diagnostic interview to confirm alcohol dependence and assess&#xD;
      for opioid use and chronic pain. The PI/RA will conduct research intake assessments and&#xD;
      interview and collect blood for biomarker (5mL) and genetic (10mL) analyses. The PI/RA will&#xD;
      randomize subjects to intervention (XR-NTX+CM) or Standard Care using a random number&#xD;
      generator with randomly permuted blocks with allocations contained within opaque sealed&#xD;
      envelopes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. For subjects randomized to the Intervention Arm, the PI/RA will confirm the drug screen&#xD;
           is negative for opioids prior to administering XR-NTX 380mg as an intramuscular gluteal&#xD;
           injection. The PI/RA will facilitate a person-centered, harm-reduction-based&#xD;
           motivational interview, , and psychosocial assessment/interview to inform subjects'&#xD;
           care-management plans. Subjects will receive a one-week referral to Bellevue ambulatory&#xD;
           care for initial Alcohol-Medical Management (MM) and will also be scheduled every 4&#xD;
           weeks (after most recent XR-NTX injection) for MM and XR-NTX injections. When possible,&#xD;
           participants who miss MM-injection visits will be navigated to clinic upon their next ED&#xD;
           presentation and/or may receive MM and XR-NTX in the ED. XR-NTX will be administered by&#xD;
           the PI or a provider (physician, physician assistant, or registered nurse) who is&#xD;
           trained in the administration of XR-NTX. The schedule for MM-Injection visits is weeks&#xD;
           4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24. Participants may be offered to continue XR-NTX treatment&#xD;
           through this study for as many has 12 injections in total as we explore the feasibility,&#xD;
           acceptability and potential benefits of extending treatment duration to 12 months. The&#xD;
           schedule for potential additional MM-Injection visits is weeks 28, 32, 36, 40, and 44.&#xD;
           Research assessment visits will occur at weeks 12, 24, and 48 and may be conducted up to&#xD;
           28 days prior to- or 90 days after- date in which research visits are due. During&#xD;
           research visits, the PI/RA will repeat the assessments that were conducted at the&#xD;
           initial enrollment visit plus adverse events and participant satisfaction and we will&#xD;
           collect a 5mL blood sample to examine alcohol consumption biomarkers. Subject&#xD;
           participation ends after the week-48 research visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. For subjects randomized to the Standard care arm, the PI/RA will provide referral to&#xD;
           Bellevue ambulatory care for MM without further intervention. Research assessment visits&#xD;
           will occur at weeks 12, 24, and 48 and may be conducted up to 28 days prior to- or 90&#xD;
           days after- date in which research visits are due. During research visits, the PI/RA&#xD;
           will repeat the assessments that were conducted at the initial enrollment visit plus&#xD;
           adverse events and participant satisfaction and we will collect a 5mL blood sample to&#xD;
           examine alcohol consumption biomarkers. Subject participation ends after the week-48&#xD;
           research visit.&#xD;
