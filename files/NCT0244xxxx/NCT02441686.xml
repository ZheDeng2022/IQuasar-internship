  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating a combination of three drugs called lenalidomide,&#xD;
      subcutaneous (injection under the skin) bortezomib, and dexamethasone (RVD) as a possible&#xD;
      treatment for multiple myeloma.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial, which tests the safety and effectiveness of&#xD;
      an investigational combination of drugs to learn whether the combination of drugs works in&#xD;
      treating a specific cancer. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the combination of drugs is being&#xD;
      studied. It also means that the FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not yet&#xD;
      approved the combination of drugs for your type of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each of the individual drugs, lenalidomide , subcutaneous bortezomib, and dexamethasone, are&#xD;
      approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The combination has not been&#xD;
      approved yet for multiple myeloma or any other type of cancer. Subcutaneous bortezomib is&#xD;
      currently approved by the U.S. FDA for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory&#xD;
      multiple myeloma. Lenalidomide is currently approved for use with dexamethasone for patients&#xD;
      with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy and for the treatment of&#xD;
      certain types of myelodysplastic syndrome (another form of cancer affecting the blood). Both&#xD;
      Bortezomib and Lenalidomide kill tumor cells and help the body cells to fight cancer.&#xD;
      Dexamethasone is commonly used, either alone, or in combination with other drugs, to treat&#xD;
      multiple myeloma. Dexamethasone heps to reduce irritation and cell injury (inflammation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are looking to explore the drug combination of&#xD;
      lenalidomide, subcutaneous bortezomib and dexamethasone to see what side effects it may have&#xD;
      and how well it works for treatment of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. This 3 drug regimen&#xD;
      showed promising results in previous studies, however administration of intravenous&#xD;
      bortezomib caused high levels of nerve injury (a condition involving the nerves of the upper&#xD;
      and lower extremities associated with numbness, tingling and burning). In this study, the&#xD;
      investigators are testing the hypothesis that subcutaneous administration of bortezomib will&#xD;
      result in less nerve toxicity. Therefore, the combination of lenalidomide, dexamethasone and&#xD;
      subcutaneous bortezomib may be better tolerated and may allow for a longer duration of&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
