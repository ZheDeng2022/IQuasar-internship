      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common tick-borne illness in the United States, Lyme disease is caused by Borrelia&#xD;
      burgdorferi bacteria that are transmitted to people by Ixodes scapularis ticks. Most cases of&#xD;
      Lyme disease are cured by antibiotics, but some patients continue to experience symptoms&#xD;
      despite the absence of detectable Lyme bacteria. Xenodiagnosis uses a vector to detect the&#xD;
      presence of a disease-causing microbe.. Researchers will use live, laboratory-bred ticks to&#xD;
      see if Lyme disease bacteria can be detected in people after completing antibiotic therapy&#xD;
      and if that is more common in people who continue to experience symptoms such as fatigue and&#xD;
      joint pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To see if ticks can be used to detect B. burgdorferi in people who have had Lyme disease&#xD;
      and received antibiotic therapy and if it correlates with persistent symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adults at least 18 years old who have:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Untreated erythema migrans (the Lyme disease rash); OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Untreated Lyme arthritis; OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Continuing symptoms after treatment for Lyme disease; OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Had Lyme disease and antibiotic treatment within the past 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine tests, health questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Up to 30 laboratory-bred, pathogen-free, larval ticks (each smaller than a poppy seed)&#xD;
           will be placed under a dressing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may have two small biopsies of skin .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  4 6 days later, Visit 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dressing will be removed and ticks will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will answer symptom questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If many ticks are still attached, participants will have to come back the next day. If&#xD;
           not enough ticks feed successfully, the procedure may be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will keep a diary of symptoms for 30 days. Over 3 months, they will be&#xD;
           return to the clinic 3 times to see how they feel and answer questionnaires. Test&#xD;
           results will be discussed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lyme disease is the most common vector borne disease in the United States. Although&#xD;
      antibiotic therapy is clinically effective in treating the symptoms of Lyme disease for most&#xD;
      patients early in the course of disease, a significant number of patients who receive therapy&#xD;
      report persistent symptoms. The cause of persistent symptoms after antibiotic therapy for&#xD;
      Lyme disease is an area of great controversy. Recent studies have shown that the organism&#xD;
      (Borrelia burgdorferi) may persist in animals after antibiotic therapy and can be detected by&#xD;
      using the natural tick vector (Ixodes scapularis) to acquire the organism through feeding&#xD;
      (xenodiagnosis). Whether this occurs in humans is unknown. Currently available tests for&#xD;
      human Lyme disease do not allow determination of persistent infection after antibiotic&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We performed the first study of the use of I. scapularis larva for the xenodiagnosis of B.&#xD;
      burgdorferi infection in humans. Our pilot study showed that xenodiagnosis was well tolerated&#xD;
      with no severe adverse events (AEs). The most common AE was mild itching at the site. In this&#xD;
      small pilot study, xenodiagnosis for B. burgdorferi was positive in 2 participants and&#xD;
      indeterminate in 2 participants. Further studies are needed to determine the sensitivity of&#xD;
      xenodiagnosis in evaluating the infection status of Lyme disease patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this proposal, we want to further investigate the utility of xenodiagnosis for identifying&#xD;
      persistence of infection with B. burgdorferi in treated human Lyme disease. Our objectives&#xD;
      include assessing the link between detection of B. burgdorferi by xenodiagnosis and&#xD;
      persistence of symptoms in patients diagnosed with Lyme disease, within 1 year, post therapy;&#xD;
      compare the rate of detection of B. burgdorferi by xenodiagnosis after therapy in&#xD;
      participants with posttreatment Lyme disease symptoms; identify subject characteristics&#xD;
      related to the likelihood of detecting B. burgdorferi by xenodiagnosis including: time from&#xD;
      infection, time between infection and therapy, time from therapy; and continue to assess the&#xD;
      safety of xenodiagnosis in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of study have the potential to resolve this long-standing controversy in Lyme&#xD;
      disease pathogenesis. While xenodiagnosis is unlikely to be widely used in clinical practice&#xD;
      due to the labor intensity and speed of testing, if our study shows a linkage between&#xD;
      positive xenodiagnostic testing and persistence of symptoms after B. burgdorferi infection,&#xD;
      it may prove to be a useful tool for testing new strategies for treatment and for correlation&#xD;
      with more generally applicable diagnostic markers. Understanding the pathogenesis of&#xD;
      persistent symptoms following Lyme disease, and identifying reliable diagnostic tests for&#xD;
      determining the success of antibiotic therapy, is critical to the medical management of these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

&#xD;
        HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS (N=20)&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age 18 or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. No prior history of Lyme disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Negative whole cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or C6-based antibody&#xD;
             test for Lyme disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with recently diagnosed (acute) EM (within 48 hours of starting antibiotic&#xD;
        therapy) and patients with untreated Lyme arthritis will be recruited in an attempt to&#xD;
        increase the chances of finding a positive result by xenodiagnosis (an attempt of a&#xD;
        positive control ) While patients with acute untreated EM would be the best positive&#xD;
        control group, it would be unethical to withhold therapy in these patients for the few days&#xD;
        required for tick feeding, due to the risk of dissemination of the organism and possible&#xD;
        morbidity. Patients with untreated Lyme arthritis will be recruited to establish whether&#xD;
        xenodiagnosis can be used to identify infection in late stage Lyme patients where the&#xD;
        bacterium is known to be present. These patients have been infected for months and will not&#xD;
        be harmed for delaying therapy for a few days. Lyme arthritis is a late manifestation of B.&#xD;
        burgdorferi infection, and hematogenous dissemination already occurred at this late stage.&#xD;
        Studies have shown that the presence or absence of previous antibiotic treatment is more&#xD;
        predictive than the duration of untreated arthritis for the success of antibiotic therapy&#xD;
        in Lyme arthritis. Similarly, patients who just started therapy for EM may still have live&#xD;
        Borrelia in the skin and xenodiagnosis may be able to recover the bacteria (but culture of&#xD;
        skin biopsies from patients with EM become negative very quickly - within one dose - on&#xD;
        antibiotic therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
        While treatment for Lyme disease will not be offered under this protocol, it may be&#xD;
        available via different clinical research protocols or regular medical care at the study&#xD;
        site. If not, treatment will be prescribed by the patient s primary care. For patients with&#xD;
        untreated early Lyme disease (erythema migrans), antibiotics can be started at the same day&#xD;
        of tick placement. For patients with untreated Lyme arthritis, antibiotics can be started&#xD;
        after collection of xenodiagnostic ticks (usually 4-5 days, up to 7 days). For patients&#xD;
        with Lyme arthritis, if less than 14 ticks fed successfully and if the participant agrees,&#xD;
        antibiotic treatment can be delayed until after the repeat procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with acute EM and untreated Lyme arthritis will be able to re-enroll as Patients&#xD;
        with Lyme disease, post-therapy. Therefore, in case of positive results, we will be able to&#xD;
        compare between the procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Negative control patients will include healthy volunteers from Lyme endemic areas who have&#xD;
        never been diagnosed with Lyme disease and have a negative B. burgdorferi ELISA and C6&#xD;
        antibody titer.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. No antibiotic therapy active against Lyme disease in the previous 3 months (except&#xD;
             patients with acute EM). Prophylaxis with a single dose of doxycycline 200 mg is not&#xD;
             an exclusion.&#xD;

             and replacement doses of steroids are not exclusions).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Any other condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would make the patient&#xD;
             unsuitable for enrollment or could interfere with the patient participating in and&#xD;
             completing the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Refusal to participate in specimen collection and storage for future study related&#xD;
