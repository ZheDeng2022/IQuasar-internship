  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the level of Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) in&#xD;
      cancer patients before and after undergoing treatment regimens where the primary treatment&#xD;
      modality is radiation therapy (XRT). Specifically, there is interest in the change in CTCs&#xD;
      pre- and post- XRT, both in absolute and relative terms.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CTCs measurements will be taken pre- and post-RT treatment. CTCs measurements will also be&#xD;
      taken during treatment. The CTCs measurements from this study will provide essential&#xD;
      information for the power and sample size considerations for future translational studies,&#xD;
      particularly for those looking to identify biomarkers possibly associated with CTCs and tumor&#xD;
      response activity after XRT, and to adequately power more formal statistical comparisons of&#xD;
      important associations between CTCs and patient characteristics and outcomes.&#xD;
