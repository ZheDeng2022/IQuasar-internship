    <textblock>
      This phase I clinical trial studies the safety and best dose of selumetinib and cixutumumab&#xD;
      in treating patients with advanced solid malignancies. Selumetinib may stop the growth of&#xD;
      tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies,&#xD;
      such as cixutumumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of&#xD;
      tumor to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry&#xD;
      [cancer/tumor]-killing substances to them.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the safety and toxicity of the combination of AZD6244 and IMC-A12 in advanced&#xD;
      solid tumors that have progressed on standard therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Finding the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended phase II dose of the combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Explore preliminary evidence of efficacy of the combination of AZD6244 and IMC-A12 in&#xD;
      advanced solid tumors using RECIST criteria for tumor response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Define pharmacodynamic (PD) profile of the combination of IMC-A12 and AZD6244.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Correlate pharmacokinetics (PK) of the combination of IMC-A12 and AZD6244 to&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic (PD) endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Assess the PK/PD (phospho-S6) link with AZD6244 when administered in combination with&#xD;
      IMC-A12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of selumetinib and cixutumumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive selumetinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28 and cixutumumab&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.&#xD;
