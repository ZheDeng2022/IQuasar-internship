      The purpose of the study is to confirm the clinical effectiveness and safety of topical&#xD;
      diammine silver fluoride (DASF) as a tooth desensitizer in adulst by comparing it to the&#xD;
      application of sterile water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in two different sites in Peru. Participantes will be 144 adults&#xD;
      who will have at least one vital maxillary or mandibular cuspid or premolar with a cervical&#xD;
      defect on the buccal surface and clinical hypersensitivity in response to air. Subjects will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to a topical application of DAS or sterile water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reduction of pain (sensitivity) using a 100 mm VAS, will be determined. Safety will be&#xD;
      also determined by evaluating the gingival condition (erythema, white changes, ulceration,&#xD;
      staining) before and ater the application of the products. The evaluation times will be 24&#xD;
      hours and 7 days.&#xD;

      Specific Aim: The purpose of this study is to confirm the clinical effectiveness and safety&#xD;
      of topical diammine silver fluoride (DASF) as a tooth desensitizer in adults by comparing it&#xD;
      to the application of sterile water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This is a blinded, randomized clinical trial with two groups. The study will be 1&#xD;
      week in duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Sites: The study will be conducted in two different sites in Peru (Cayetano University&#xD;
      and Universidad Andina del Cusco). Cayetano University is a major private university in South&#xD;
      America. It is a recipient of Fogerty International Center funds from NIH and has a history&#xD;
      of successful collaboration with US universities, including the University of Washington. Dr.&#xD;
      Castillo, the principal investigator, received his training in orthodontics at the University&#xD;
      of Washington and is familiar with US clinical trials procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: Participants will be 144 adults (18 to 50 years). Males and females will be&#xD;
      included. Each site (Cayetano and Cusco) will recruit 72 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria: To be included the subject must have at least one vital maxillary or&#xD;
      mandibular cuspid or premolar with a cervical defect on the buccal surface and clinical&#xD;
      hypersensitivity in response to air with a score not less than 15 on the VAS for pain&#xD;
      (described below). The individual will have generally healthy gum tissue surrounding this&#xD;
      tooth and no ulceration, and no leukoplakia (white changes) in this gingival tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria: Excluded will be subjects who are using any type of commercially&#xD;
      available tooth desensitizer, have received a fluoride varnish treatment within the last&#xD;
      month, or who are taking prescription medications of any kind, are taking aspirin or&#xD;
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs habitually, and women who are pregnant. Individuals&#xD;
      using smokeless tobacco will be excluded. Individuals with known sensitivity to silver or&#xD;
      other heavy-metal ions will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Recruitment: Subjects will be recruited from the patient populations of Cayetano&#xD;
      University School of Dentistry and Universidad Andina del Cusco School of Dentistry. Subjects&#xD;
      will be offered a small financial incentive for participation, paid as $10 US at the second&#xD;
      visit (24 hours) and $20 US at the 1-week check.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protection of Human Subjects: The Institutional Review Board of Cayetano University will&#xD;
      review the protocol, and the informed consent of all participants will be obtained. The&#xD;
      Cayetano IRB is familiar with US procedures because NIH level work is conducted there.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Conditions: Subjects will be randomly assigned to a topical application of DASF or&#xD;
      sterile water. The randomization will be stratified on study site and baseline sensitivity&#xD;
      score to a 5-second blast of pressurized air at 2 cm distance from the tooth (see description&#xD;
      of measures below). Odor is not a threat to blinding because the smell is not detectable&#xD;
      clinically when using such small quantities. Taste is not a threat in this study because only&#xD;
      mg amounts of material are applied, and the tooth is air-dried after application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The random treatment assignments will be generated by the project statistician. The&#xD;
      randomization to the two treatments will be done with stratification on study site and&#xD;
      baseline pain score (&lt;37 and ≥37), and blocking to ensure the two treatment groups will be&#xD;
      balanced across the study period and within each stratum. The stratification at 37 was chosen&#xD;
      from the literature (Ritter et al., 2006, paper appended) to ensure balance. A pretest of the&#xD;
      VAS with 10 pretest subjects in Peru confirmed that the mean response was in this range.&#xD;
      Block sizes will be equal to 2 or 4, and will be chosen randomly with 2/3 and 1/3&#xD;
      probability, respectively. The randomization list will be prepared using the &quot;sample&quot;&#xD;
      function of R statistical software (Version 2.7.1, The R Foundation for Statistical&#xD;
      Computing, 2008). The assignments will be recorded on slips of paper numbered consecutively&#xD;
      within each stratum and then placed inside sealed envelopes sequentially numbered by stratum.&#xD;
      The statistician will retain the master list, and the code will not be broken until all the&#xD;
      data are analyzed. The clinician will open the envelope and apply the agent. The agents&#xD;
      (active or control) will be packaged in identical bottles labeled as A or B. The packaging&#xD;
      will be done by the investigational pharmacy at Cayetano University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diammine silver fluoride (Saforide, Toyo Seiyaku Kasei Co. Ltd. Osaka, Japan) will be used.&#xD;
      Saforide is a clear and colorless liquid with a weak odor of ammonia. It is a solution of&#xD;
      diammine silver fluoride [Ag(NH3)2F]. It includes not less than 24.4w/v% and not more than&#xD;
      26.8 w/v% of silver (Ag), not less than 5.0 w/v% and not more than 5.9 w/v% of fluorine (F).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome-Clinical Reduction of pain (sensitivity)-The teeth will be isolated with&#xD;
      cotton gauze, and subjects will report tooth pain on a 100-mm VAS (Ritter et al., 2006, paper&#xD;
      appended) before treatment and after treatment to a 5-second blast of pressurized air at 2 cm&#xD;
      distance from the tooth. The VAS will be anchored with &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;intolerable pain.&quot; The&#xD;
      follow-up test will be repeated at 24 hours and 1 week later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment will be conducted in Spanish (forms appended). We have pretested the scale to&#xD;
      be sure the descriptors are translated properly. The terms &quot;sensitivity,&quot; &quot;dentin&#xD;
      sensitivity&quot; and &quot;pain&quot; are used interchangeably in this literature. For subjects with&#xD;
      multiple test teeth, VAS scores will be averaged to produce one score per subject at each&#xD;
      time point. The primary end-point will be 1 week after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will test application of diammine silver fluoride in a single visit because&#xD;
      previous work shows that a single application physically blocks most dentinal tubules and&#xD;
      that additional applications are not necessary, as sensitivity is reduced significantly. The&#xD;
      clinical procedure is that a disposable microbrush is dipped into a small drop of the&#xD;
      diammine silver fluoride or the control and then applied to the surface for 1 second, as is&#xD;
      done clinically. Then the surface is gently air-dried and the procedure repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Damage to Gingiva-Tissues will be photographed before application of any agents to&#xD;
      establish the normal baseline condition. Gingival tissues surrounding each tooth treated will&#xD;
      be examined clinically immediately after treatment, at 24 hours and one week later. A&#xD;
      photograph of the assignment envelope and ID will be taken at the same time be sure photos&#xD;
      are properly accounted for.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary safety measure will be erythema. It will be assessed visually without&#xD;
      magnification using a standard dental light. Erythema (red changes) will be rated on a 1 to 3&#xD;
      scale, where 1 is no redness and 3 is a severe change. For subjects with more than one test&#xD;
      tooth, scores will be averaged for all test teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Gingival Index (Löe,1967) will also be used to measure gingival inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      White changes, ulceration, and staining will be secondary measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      White changes will be rated as present or absent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ulceration will be rated as present or absent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Staining (localized argyria) of the cervical gingival tissue will be rated as present or&#xD;
      absent. The perioral area will also be assessed for argyria, present or absent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality Assurance: There will be two examiners (Drs. Roccio Lazio and Shirley Rivera, who&#xD;
      will have no role in any other aspect of the study and will be blind to study aims and group&#xD;
      assignment. The examiners will be trained clinically to assess sensitivity and for the safety&#xD;
      assessment, using standard photographs. As part of the training each examiner will rate 10&#xD;
      patients who are not part of the randomized study, and the intraclass correlation (ICC) will&#xD;
      be calculated. Each examiner will test each patient. Each examiner will rate the gingival&#xD;
      tissues for erythema, white changes, ulceration and staining and also take a clinical&#xD;
      photograph of the gingival tissue at each examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training for rating erythema: Trainees will view standard photographs showing no redness,&#xD;
      some redness, and severe redness. They will each then examine and rate all 10 training&#xD;
      patients independently, chosen to represent a range of severity. They will be allowed to&#xD;
      refer to the standard photos during the rating. The intraclass correlation will be calculated&#xD;
      for the two examiners. Examiners will be trained to achieve agreement with ICC=0.8 or better&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training for Gingival Index: Examiners will be instructed clinically on the GI. Then each&#xD;
      will assess bleeding around the premolars in each of 5 patients chosen randomly from the 10&#xD;
      to be assessed. Scores will be calculated and the Wkappa calculated for the two examiners.&#xD;
      Examiners will be trained to achieve agreement with ICC=0.8 or better&#xD;
&#xD;
      An independent examiner, Dr. Tar Chee Aw, who will be blind to the study conditions, will&#xD;
      separately rate the post-treatment photographs of the gingival tissues for erythema, white&#xD;
      changes, ulceration and staining in the same manner as the clinical examiner but without&#xD;
      access to the earlier ratings. The photographs will be masked to avoid bias from tooth&#xD;
      staining and will be presented to the examiner in random order. The intraclass correlation&#xD;
      (ICC) to assess between-examiner reliability will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Case-report forms have been developed and local staff trained in their use. Original forms&#xD;
      and photographs will be kept in a site notebook, stored in a locked cabinet, and be readily&#xD;
      available for audit. All entries will be in black ink, signed and dated. Copies will be made&#xD;
      and sent to the data coordinating center at the University of Washington for entry and&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Procedure: All tooth surfaces that meet the entry criteria will be treated in an&#xD;
      individual's mouth up to a limit of 3 surfaces per patient. All the surfaces in an individual&#xD;
      will receive the same treatment. The surface will be isolated with a cotton roll and then&#xD;
      will be gently dried with cotton gauze. A disposable dental microbrush (Kerr Quiktips) will&#xD;
      be dipped in a small drop of diammine silver fluoride or water and then applied to the&#xD;
      surface for 1 second, as is done clinically. Then the surface will be gently air-dried. Then&#xD;
      the procedure will be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this point each of the two examiners, blind to the aims of the study and treatment&#xD;
      condition, will begin the assessment for both sensitivity and safety. The follow-up&#xD;
      assessment will be conducted at 24 hours and again at 1 week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data from the two sites will be analyzed separately to demonstrate the treatment effect&#xD;
      on tooth pain. To confirm reduction in pain (sensitivity, the clinical indication), average&#xD;
      difference scores between pretreatment and post- treatment VAS scores for each individual&#xD;
      will be calculated for each time point (immediately after treatment, and 24 hours and 1 week&#xD;
      after treatment) and t-tests will be used to compare changes. The primary end point will be&#xD;
      at 1 week. GEE linear regression will be used in a secondary analysis to compare the&#xD;
      reduction in pain across the three time points, where the outcome is sensitivity at the three&#xD;
      time points, the baseline pain is a covariate, and robust standard errors are used to account&#xD;
      for multiple observations per subject. In addition, separate analyses of covariance will be&#xD;
      done at each time point to compare the reduction in pain due to the active treatment between&#xD;
      the two study sites, where the outcome is the pain a particular time point, baseline pain is&#xD;
      entered as a covariate, and treatment and site, as well as an treatment group by site&#xD;
      interaction, are entered as factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fisher's Exact Test will be used to assess whether there are more subjects with erythema&#xD;
      score &gt;1 in the diammine silver fluoride group versus the control group. (The tests will be&#xD;
      conducted separately at each time period, immediately after treatment, at 24 hours and 1&#xD;
      week.) Initially tests will be conducted separately by site, then by combining both sites to&#xD;
      increase the statistical power to detect differences in the safety measures. The primary end&#xD;
      point will be assessed at 24 hours. A t-test test will assess any differences in Gingival&#xD;
      Index. Any white changes, ulceration and staining (argyria) will be reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data from the two sites will be analyzed separately, and power is described for the&#xD;
      separate site analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reduction in Tooth Sensitivity (clinical indication): The primary end point will be assessed&#xD;
      at 7 days post-treatment. In a similar desensitization study comparing several devices&#xD;
      including the predicate device (Ritter et al., 2006, paper appended) pain on air-blast&#xD;
      reports for Duraphat dropped from 36.9 (SD=26.2) at baseline to 20.8 (SD=4.3) at 24 weeks&#xD;
      post-treatment. We expect a similar or much larger drop after 7 days with DASF, based on&#xD;
      unpublished work from the University of Hong Kong (data appended) and little or no drop from&#xD;
      the application of sterile water. The Hong Kong data suggest we will achieve a much greater&#xD;
      reduction in tooth sensitivity than observed in the Ritter study. Thus a sample size of 31 in&#xD;
      a group will allow detection of effect size from 0.64 (calculated from the Duraphat work)&#xD;
      upwards with an alpha of 0.05 and power of 0.8 (one-sided test, online calculator:&#xD;
      http://www.danielsoper.com/statcalc/calc47.aspx). To increase the statistical power to detect&#xD;
      smaller differences, the outcome data will also be analyzed for both sites combined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect no (or at least very low) attrition over the short time period of the study, but to&#xD;
      account for possible attrition, the sample size will be inflated to 144 or 72 per site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on Fisher's Exact Test and separate analyses by site with only 25 subjects per group&#xD;
      the power is 86% to detect a difference in the proportion of subjects with a gingival&#xD;
      inflammation score &gt;1 of 10 out of 25 (40%) versus 1 out of 25 (4%) and 85% to detect a&#xD;
      difference of 8 out of 25 (32%) versus 0 out of 25 (0%). To increase the statistical power to&#xD;
      detect smaller differences, the safety outcomes will be also analyzed for both sites&#xD;
      combined. Based on Fisher's Exact Test with 50 subjects per group the power is 84% to detect&#xD;
      a difference of 9 out of 50 (18%) versus 1 out of 50 (2%) and 80% to detect a difference of 4&#xD;
      out of 50 (8%) versus 0 out of 50 (0%) (Bertil Olofosson, StudySize, Version 2.0.4, CreoStat&#xD;
      HB, 2007). Note: no recent studies have reported any gingival inflammatory changes, nor do we&#xD;
      expect to see any.&#xD;
