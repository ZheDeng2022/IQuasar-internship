    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long term effect of exercise therapy and patient&#xD;
      education compared to patient education only in individuals with hip OA, and to evaluate&#xD;
      predictive factors for changes in hip osteoarthritis both clinically and on x-ray.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main hypothesis H01: There are no significant long term ( 2 years) differences in hip&#xD;
      function, quality of life, physical function and radiological changes between those&#xD;
      individuals who went through a patient education program and a 12 week exercise therapy&#xD;
      program compared to patient education program only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      109 patients with radiographically verified hip OA are included in the randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial; randomized to 12 week exercise therapy program and patient education (n=55) and&#xD;
      patient education program only (n=54).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected 2 years after completed intervention period in the original RCT, and 6&#xD;
      months and 2 years postoperatively for those patients who have undergone total hip&#xD;
      arthroplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Disease Specific WOMAC-Index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hip X-ray, SF-36v2 (quality of life),PASE (activity score), Self-efficacy for pain,&#xD;
      isokinetic muscle strength tests, 6 minute walk test, Åstrand's bike test, range of motion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Status:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a prolongation of an on-going RCT (3a-2005-NAR). The inclusion, intervention&#xD;
      and follow-ups including 1 year follow-up is completed. 2 year post-intervention follow-up&#xD;
      will be completed in 2010, 2 year follow-up postoperative for patients undergoing total hip&#xD;
      artroplasty will continue throughout 2011.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be carried out: NAR-Orthopedic Centre, Ullevaal University Hospital.&#xD;

      Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1 To evaluate the long-term effects of a patient education program and a 12 week exercise&#xD;
      therapy program (IG) compared to patient education only (CG) on hip function, quality of life&#xD;
      and physical function in patients with hip OA not eligible for total hip arthroplasty (THA)&#xD;
      at time of inclusion Aim 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To examine differences in radiographic changes between those individuals who went&#xD;
           through a patient education program and a 12 week exercise therapy program (IG) compared&#xD;
           to those who only went through a patient education program (CG) 2 years after inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To examine predictive factors for radiographic changes and changes in hip function at a&#xD;
           2 year follow-up after inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate hip function, quality of life and physical function in those patients who&#xD;
           have gone through total hip arthroplasty (THA)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To examine differences in hip function, quality of life, and physical function in&#xD;
           patients who prior to surgery went through a patient education program and a 12 week&#xD;
           exercise therapy program (IG) compared those patients who went through a patient&#xD;
           education program only (CG) 6 months after THA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a prospective, randomized clinical trial examining the long term effect of two&#xD;
      different interventions for patients with hip OA. The long term follow-up is based on an&#xD;
      ongoing study (03a-2005-NAR) on short term outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      109 patients were recruited from Orthopaedic Center, Ullevål University Hospital, NIMI, and&#xD;
      Diakonhjemmet Hospital, Oslo from April 2005 till October 2007.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients between 40 and 80 years old with uni- or bilateral hip disability not eligible for&#xD;
      hip surgery will be recruited from Orthopaedic Centre, Ullevål University Hospital, NIMI, and&#xD;
      Diakonhjemmets Sykehus (Hospital), Oslo. Inclusion criteria for all subjects are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Harris Hip Score (35) between 60 and 95, and hip pain of more than 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiographic verified hip OA,classified by an orthopaedic surgeon (LN), according to&#xD;
           Danielsson's criteria for radiographic hip OA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be excluded if they have a history of resent trauma or functional impairment to&#xD;
      the lower limbs or diseases which might interfere with participation (rheumatoid arthritis,&#xD;
      cancer, osteoporosis, severe back pain, knee OA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with co-morbidities not tolerating physical activities will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interventions are described in the registration concerning the short-term follow-up study&#xD;
      (03a-2005-NAR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end point for Aim 1 and 3 is WOMAC (hip function), and the primary endpoint for&#xD;
      Aim 2 is radiographic changes using the Danielsson's criteria for minimal joint space.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain and Functional Activity: The primary (main) outcome measurement is the self-reported&#xD;
      functional outcome measure, the disease-specific questionnaire Western Ontario and McMaster&#xD;
      Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). WOMAC is found to be a valid, reliable and&#xD;
      responsive outcome measure in patients with hip OA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The self-reported Physical Activity Score for the Elderly (PASE) will be used to record the&#xD;
      individuals activity level prior to inclusion and at follow-up intervals. Hip pain will be&#xD;
      recorded on a visual analogue scale (VAS) rating from 0 to 100 mm; 0 represents &quot;no pain&quot; and&#xD;
      100 represents &quot;as much pain he/she can possibly imagine&quot;. The pain will be recorded after&#xD;
      the 6 minutes walking test (se below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six minute walk test (Enright, 2003): Observed functional capacity and cardiovascular fitness&#xD;
      will be assessed by a six minute walk test. This test has been reliability estimated for&#xD;
      older adults and validated for older adults and individuals with total hip arthroplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health related quality of life and pain management: Quality of life will be assessed by using&#xD;
      the self-administered generic questionnaire 36-item short-form health survey (SF-36) version&#xD;
      2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle strength: Isokinetic muscle strength will be tested in Technogym REV 9000 (Gambettola,&#xD;
      Italia) and measured as peak torque at 60°s-1 for hip flexion/extension, knee&#xD;
      flexion/extension and ankle flexion/extension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular Fitness (Åstrand &amp; Rodahl, 1986): Tested by a sub-maximal bicycle ergometer&#xD;
      test according to the method described by Åstrand &amp; Rodahl. The load will be adjusted to each&#xD;
      subject. Results will be corrected for age and gender and expressed in ml O2 / kg / min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Range of motion: Measured with a plastic goniometer. Flexion, abduction, and adduction is&#xD;
      registered in supine position, with a fixation of the contralateral leg. Internal and&#xD;
      external rotation is registered in prone position with fixation over buttocks. Extension is&#xD;
      registered according to Thomas test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiographic examination: Hip X-rays will be taken at inclusion and at 2 year follow-up, and&#xD;
      are classified by an orthopaedic surgeon (LN), according to Danielsson's criteria for&#xD;
      radiographic hip OA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collections and Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected at inclusion, after the 12 weeks intervention period, and at&#xD;
      follow-ups at 6 months, 1 year and 2 years. Data from all outcome measurements will be&#xD;
      collected from all patients at all follow-ups, except at 1 year follow-up, where only the&#xD;
      questionnaires will be included. Radiographic examination is only included at inclusion and&#xD;
      at 2 year follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power Calculations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The WOMAC Index is the main outcome measurement. Power calculations based on a standard&#xD;
      deviation of 23 mm, and a minimum clinically important difference of 15 mm between groups&#xD;
      calculated that there is a need for 49 patients in each group. To account for drop-outs, a&#xD;
      total of 109 patients is included in the RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Personnel responsible for the intervention will not be involved in data collection. Physical&#xD;
      therapists collecting data will be blinded for patients' group allocation. A research&#xD;
      coordinate person, not involved in any part of the study intervention or data collections,&#xD;
      will be responsible for randomization procedures (give subjects information about group&#xD;
      allocation)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data in the randomized controlled trial will be analyzed both according to the intention to&#xD;
      treat principles and additional analysis for the compliers adhering to the exercise protocol&#xD;
      at a cut-off value of 24 or more training sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Registration of Complications, Drop-Outs and Compliance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complications and drop-outs will be registered by persons responsible for data collection.&#xD;
      There will be used intention to treat analysis. Compliance to the patient education and the&#xD;
      exercise protocol will be registered by the physical therapists responsible for the&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients and control subjects will receive written and oral information about the study&#xD;
      and sign an informed consent before inclusion. The project will be performed according to&#xD;
      recommendations of the Helsinki Declaration. Approval is obtained from the Regional Committee&#xD;
      of Medical Research Ethics.&#xD;
