  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure the mechanical properties of healing Achilles tendons&#xD;
      in humans after early controlled weightbearing, compared with a control group in a&#xD;
      randomized, single-blinded trial. The mechanical properties are measured using&#xD;
      radiostereophotogrammetic x-rays (RSA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Early weightbearing improves mechanical properties of the healing Achilles&#xD;
      tendon.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patient with an acute Achilles tendon rupture coming to the local emergency room are asked to&#xD;
      participate in our study. Patients have to be between 18 and 60 years and they must not have&#xD;
      any contraindications for surgical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are interested in participating in the study receive oral and in written&#xD;
      information about the study of the main investigator of the study (Thorsten Schepull).&#xD;
      Patients who then agree to participate in the study are registered for surgery. All patients&#xD;
      are operated the same way in local anaesthesia within 5 days after injury. We are going to&#xD;
      use a conventional open technique with a dorso-medial approach. Tendon ends are going to be&#xD;
      adapted with a resorbable suture and we are going to implant 2 Tantalum beads (size 0.8 mm)&#xD;
      in the distal part of the tendon and 2 Tantalum beads with the same size in the proximal&#xD;
      part. A short leg cast is going to be applied with the foot in the equinus position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization to early weightbearing or control group is done postoperatively&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 (control group):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The short leg cast that is going to be applied during operation with the foot in the equinus&#xD;
      position is removed after 3.5 weeks and a new cast is applied with the ankle in a neutral&#xD;
      position for another 3.5 weeks. The new cast is removed after 3.5 weeks (cast treatment in&#xD;
      total 7 weeks). Physiotherapy starts after cast removal, following our previous hospital&#xD;
      routines. Full activity, including sports, is allowed after approximately 5 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are going to perform RSA after 7 weeks (within 15 minutes after cast removal), after 19&#xD;
      weeks i.e. 12 weeks after cast removal, and after 52 weeks (12 months). A certain frame is&#xD;
      used allowing us to apply a pedal to the forefoot and load it with weights. The first force&#xD;
      applied to the pedal is 25 N and the second is 150 N. The same day CT scans of the injured&#xD;
      Achilles tendon are taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 (early weightbearing):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cast from surgery i removed after 2 weeks and replaced by a removable Air Cast Walker.&#xD;
      The patient is provided with a special training pedal where pedal resistance can be increased&#xD;
      during the treatment period. The patients are using the Air Cast Walker for 5 weeks (cast&#xD;
      treatment in total 7 weeks), but is supposed to remove the cast twice a day and supposed to&#xD;
      use the training pedal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-ups at 7 (cast removal), 19 and 52 weeks using RSA and CT are performed as in group 1.&#xD;
