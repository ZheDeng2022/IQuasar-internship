    <textblock>
      Use lay language. Background: Heart failure is an increasingly frequent current pathology due&#xD;
      to the population aging and the improvement of acute and chronic heart failure management.&#xD;
      Heart failure patients have a poor quality of life because of their symptoms (asthenia,&#xD;
      dyspnea…) and frequent hospitalizations. Heart failure is an expensive disease: 1.5 % of the&#xD;
      health expenses, 85 % in hospital cost with 200 000 hospitalizations in France per year.&#xD;
      Previous studies were multidisciplinary interventions and not realistic in a daily practice&#xD;
      for a general practitioner. The aim of this project is to integrate therapeutic education for&#xD;
      heart failure patients in a current practice. The patient becomes competent to manage his&#xD;
      disease and to identify acute heart failure signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective: Improve therapeutic education efficiency on life quality of heart failure&#xD;
      patients in general practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second objectives: Describe heart failure patient's hospitalizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Cluster randomized controlled clinical trial comparing intervention and control&#xD;
      groups with a follow through for 19 months for each patient. A therapeutic education program&#xD;
      will be proposed to the heart failure patients in primary care. The intervention group GP&#xD;
      will follow a workshop concerning the therapeutic education concepts and the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints: Life quality evaluation (SF-36 and Minnesota scales) and number of&#xD;
      hospitalizations of patients in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: Heart failure patients in stages I, II, and III of NYHA in primary care. Cluster&#xD;
      randomized surgeries in Auvergne (France).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results: The therapeutic education allows the patients to improve their quality of&#xD;
      life, to be able to detect their illness signs worsening in a early manner, and to contact&#xD;
      their doctor if needed. This would limit the acute heart failure due to treatment adaptation&#xD;
      or life habits.&#xD;

      General organisation of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recruitment of the GP: 3 months (from January to March 2010)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Training of the intervention group GP during a two days workshop in April 2010 on the&#xD;
           therapeutic education and the intervention by an expert team&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient Inclusions of by GP: 10 months (from April 2010 to January 2011). The included&#xD;
           patients will be followed for 19 months. Some patients will be potentially recruited&#xD;
           during the 10th month of inclusion, the follow-up period being of 29 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  First consultation used to the inclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Information to the patient and collection of the patient written agreement (without&#xD;
                informing the intervention objectives in the control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Evaluation of the life quality in both groups with the SF-36 scale (general) and&#xD;
                the Minnesota scale (HF specific) written by the patient or his/her main caregiver&#xD;
                (wife or husband, a friend...) in the waiting room after the consultation thanks to&#xD;
                a closed envelope given by the GP containing the questionnaire and a pre-paid&#xD;
                envelope.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention of the general practitioner to the patients in the scope of a therapeutic&#xD;
           education program:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  In the intervention group: first session (M1) dedicated to the educative diagnosis&#xD;
                after one month. Then 4 sessions of standardized therapeutic education and adapted&#xD;
                to the patient each three months for one year. One session in M19 will be dedicated&#xD;
                to the synthesis of what the patient learnt from these interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  In the control group: the patient is followed in consultation in the same deadlines&#xD;
                without any particular intervention in M1, M4, M7, M10, M13, M19.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Life quality evaluation of both groups at 0, 7, 13, and 19 months from the beginning of&#xD;
           the inclusion filled in by the patient or his/her main caregiver (husband or wife, a&#xD;
           friend...) thanks to a closed envelope given by the GP (at the end of his consultation)&#xD;
           containing the questionnaire and pre-paid envelope. These documents are filled in the&#xD;
           waiting room after the first consultation and at home in the 7 days following the other&#xD;
           consultations. The life quality will be evaluated at the inclusion time (M0), during the&#xD;
           intervention (M7 and M13) and at distance (M19) from the end of the intervention. The&#xD;
           Minnesota score (22, 23) has been chosen because it is validated and specific of life&#xD;
           quality of HF patients. The SF-36 score has also been retained as it permits a generic&#xD;
           and global evaluation of life quality and because its reliability, validity and&#xD;
           responsiveness have been established (24) (25) (26). SF-36 is the most widely evaluated&#xD;
           quality of life measure between 1990 and 1999 (27).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collection of the number and the duration of hospital readmission for worsening heart&#xD;
           failure and for all cause hospital readmission and of the total number of days of&#xD;
           hospitalisation during the follow-up period.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Investigators: volunteer randomized general practitioners from the Auvergne region in&#xD;
             France.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The GPs will be randomized in cluster, each GP should recruit at least five patients.&#xD;
             If several doctors are part of the same surgery, they will be randomized in the same&#xD;
             group (intervention or control). The randomization of the GPs will be stratified by&#xD;
             department. The GP commit themselves not to talk of the study between them. Each GP&#xD;
             knows in which group of the study he belongs as the intervention group comprises a&#xD;
             training seminar but the objectives of the study will not be known by the GPs of the&#xD;
             control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All the general practitioners in Auvergne (except homeopaths, acupunctures...) will be&#xD;
             contacted by mail to inform them about the study and to invite them to participate to&#xD;
             it. The volunteer GPs will have to return their written agreement via a pre-stamped&#xD;
             envelope to the investigator center with their coordinates. They will be randomized in&#xD;
             both groups (intervention and control). After the formation, each GP of the&#xD;
             intervention group would have to recruit at least five patients seen in consultation,&#xD;
             who could be included and who have given their written agreement. Each week of the&#xD;
             inclusion period, the GP will recruit the first patient having the eligibility&#xD;
             criteria until the inclusion of at least five patients. The anonymity of the patients&#xD;
             will be guaranteed in the participation contract. The data will be anonymized by the&#xD;
             investigator GP and will be submitted to the French electronic data liberty commission&#xD;
             (Commission Nationale Informatique et Libertés (CNIL)). The patients could quit the&#xD;
             study at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients: Systolic or diastolic HF patients to the stages I, II and III of the NYHA&#xD;
        followed in primary care. These patients will be recruited by the randomized GP in the&#xD;
        intervention and control groups. Patients should be over 50 years old (this age limit&#xD;
        expelled only few patients with particular pathology).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  • Are not included the stage IV, with short life expectancy, with low efficiency hope&#xD;
             of the tested measure, who are very few. The systolic and diastolic HF patients are&#xD;
             not distinguished because the possible efficiency of the intervention is not HF type&#xD;
             dependent a priori.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Dementia as Alzheimer disease diagnosed by GP.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Already included in another study&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Incapacity to follow the education sessions (language problem...)&#xD;
