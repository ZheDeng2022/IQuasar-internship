  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 5% of adults with asthma have difficult to control disease but these account&#xD;
      for up to 80% of total cost of asthma due to recurrent healthcare contact including hospital&#xD;
      admission. The reasons for &quot;difficult asthma&quot; are multi-factorial, but an important element&#xD;
      in many patients is non-adherence to steroid therapy. Recent qualitative analysis by the&#xD;
      investigators group has identified a number of both individual and group themes, related to&#xD;
      non-adherence with steroid treatment. Many of these themes such as steroid phobia, inaccurate&#xD;
      / lack of knowledge, negative attitudes and inability to deal with side-effects, are&#xD;
      potentially modifiable and the investigators believe, unless these issues are addressed, at&#xD;
      an individual patient level, adherence is unlikely to improve. This randomised parallel group&#xD;
      study will examine a nursing intervention to try and improve adherence and as a consequence,&#xD;
      asthma control, in a group of difficult asthmatics where non-adherence has been identified as&#xD;
      a significant factor. The study will use a needs-led menu driven individualised intervention&#xD;
      and will compare this to current best asthma care. The primary outcome measure will be&#xD;
      adherence to therapy, however asthma control, lung function and asthma related quality of&#xD;
      life, patients' attitudes to asthma and treatment and their levels of anxiety and depression&#xD;
      will also be examined. Addressing the issue of non-adherence is fundamental to improving&#xD;
      asthma management in this difficult group with concomitant reduction on health care costs and&#xD;
      improvements in patients' quality of life&#xD;

      Plan of investigation The study will be a single blind randomised controlled trial. Patients&#xD;
      will be recruited from those attending the difficult asthma clinic at the Belfast City&#xD;
      Hospital and deemed non-adherent (see below). Difficult asthma will be defined as; 1.&#xD;
      persisting asthma symptoms (Asthma control score &gt;3)(ACS), despite detailed assessment and&#xD;
      management; 2. minimal maintenance therapy of long acting B2-agonist and inhaled steroids (&#xD;
      800 mcg BDP or equivalent) and 3. at least 1 course of systemic steroids in the preceding 12&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non adherence will be defined as prescription filling of &lt;50% of prescribed anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      inhaled therapy utilized in preceding 6 months (from GP prescription records). All subjects&#xD;
      will be invited to take part and give consent to take part in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria will be medication adherence, a condition other than asthma contributing&#xD;
      to persisting symptoms; current smoker; significant co-morbidity due to condition other than&#xD;
      asthma. Primary Outcome measure Improvement in adherence to steroid therapy before and after&#xD;
      intervention (both 7 day prednisolone (serum assay) and inhaled steroid therapy (prescription&#xD;
      counting).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures Improvement in Asthma Control Scores (ACS) Improvement in asthma&#xD;
      Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) Improvement in Lung function Reduction in courses of&#xD;
      rescue steroid Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale These are all routinely measured as part&#xD;
      of the difficult asthma service. Study design Pre run-in period&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assessment of inclusion / exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Full informed consent Run-in period (1 week)- All participants Week 1 Prednisolone&#xD;
           course - 7 day course&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. ACS/Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) on Day 1 (Lung function breathing test) 2.&#xD;
      Serum prednisolone/cortisol and urinary cortisol/creatinine ratio on Day 7 - measures&#xD;
      adherence to prednisolone 3. Asthma control score/FEV1 Day 7 Randomisation Patients will be&#xD;
      randomized into two groups either control (usual care) or intervention group using a random&#xD;
      number generator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Group- A nurse-led programme of intervention will be devised. It will have two&#xD;
      stages incorporating:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Semi-structured audio taped interview to identify individual reasons for non-adherence&#xD;
           and assessment of readiness to change behaviour.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. An individualised package incorporating:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Asthma education programme to address any specific gaps in asthma knowledge or&#xD;
                requests for information&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Motivational interviewing based on stages of change model to encourage change and&#xD;
                adherence&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Psychological therapy involving (a) relaxation therapy (b) cognitive behavioural&#xD;
                techniques looking at negative and catastrophic thoughts and (c) panic cycle&#xD;
                adapted to respiratory patients Patients will be seen regularly (individual needs&#xD;
                determine time spans) for a period of 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group - standard asthma management. Outcome measures Primary outcome measures&#xD;
      Adherence will be determined at baseline, 3 and 9 months by prescription filling to define&#xD;
      outcome after completion of programme. During the period of follow-up, when a further 7 day&#xD;
      course of prednisolone is indicated on clinical grounds, serum prednisolone/cortisol and&#xD;
      urinary cortisol/creatinine ratio will be measured on completion of course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures These will be measured at 3 and 9 months There are currently 200&#xD;
      patients attending the difficult asthma service at Belfast City Hospital Trust all of whom&#xD;
      fulfil our definition of difficult asthma. No data is available in this specific population&#xD;
      regarding adherence with inhaled therapy but based on adherence with prednisolone and&#xD;
      adherence data with inhaled therapy in other severities of asthma, we would anticipate that&#xD;
      over 50% will be variably adherent to therapy. 1-6 months - Screening population / liaising&#xD;
      with primary care / psychological intervention training 6 months-18 months - Patient&#xD;
      recruitment and intervention package delivered 18-36 months- Follow-up and data analysis.&#xD;
