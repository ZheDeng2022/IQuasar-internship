      The purpose of this study is to explore the effect of Etoricoxib compared to Diclofenac on&#xD;
      physical activity in RA subjects with early morning pain and stiffness.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid Arhthitis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory condition characterised by prolonged&#xD;
      morning stiffness. Anti-inflammatory medication is effective in relieving the pain and&#xD;
      stiffness associated with this inflammation. By having a long half-life, Etoricoxib has a&#xD;
      simple once daily dosing regime and the long action overnight should mean that patients&#xD;
      experience more effective relief of symptoms first thing in the morning compared to shorter&#xD;
      half life medication such as Diclofenac. The activity of people can be measured using the&#xD;
      NuMact monitor which has been validated against observation and for use in RA . As the data&#xD;
      is logged in real time it is possible to extract the periods of activity at the start of the&#xD;
      day when morning stiffness will be maximal. It counts the number and vigour of steps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This can be used to give a measure of total ambulatory activity but in this instance we are&#xD;
      interested primarily in the vigour of step first thing in the morning. The vigour of the&#xD;
      steps (trunk deceleration on heel strike) is a measure of how easily and quickly a subject is&#xD;
      walking. We would expect this to be markedly reduced in people with RA during their period of&#xD;
      &quot;morning stiffness&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a study is of a randomised crossover design. The aim is to recruit 20 subjects&#xD;
      suffering from Rheumatoid Arthritis. 20 has been chosen as a suitable number to show the&#xD;
      effects of the two drugs and allow design of a definitive study. All participants will be&#xD;
      tolerant of conventional NSAIDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be given patient information sheets at least 24 hours before the first&#xD;
      visit. They will be allowed time to read the information sheet and given the opportunity to&#xD;
      ask further questions if they wish during the pre-baseline week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first visit is the baseline visit during which informed consent will be taken by the&#xD;
      Chief Investigator, all of the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be checked to ensure the&#xD;
      subject still meets the criteria. A history of NSAID use will also be taken to ensure subject&#xD;
      tolerance of the drug. Quality of life Questionnaires will be administered during this visit,&#xD;
      they will consist of the:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) which assesses dressing, arising, eating, walking,&#xD;
      hygiene, reach, grip and common activities. For each of these categories, patients report the&#xD;
      amount of difficulty they have in performing two or three specific activities. There are 4&#xD;
      possible responses; without ANY difficulty; with SOME difficulty; with MUCH difficulty;&#xD;
      UNABLE to do.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain VAS and Fatigue VAS The visual analog scale (VAS fatigue) is a horizontal line; 100 mm&#xD;
      in length, self-administered by the patient in order to rate pain from 0 &quot;no fatigue&quot; to 100&#xD;
      &quot;worst possible fatigue&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DAS28 is a measure of disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The score is calculated&#xD;
      by a mathematical formula, which includes the number of tender and swollen joints (out of a&#xD;
      total of 28), the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR, a blood marker of inflammation). A&#xD;
      DAS28 score greater than 5.1 implies active disease, less than 3.2 well controlled disease,&#xD;
      and less than 2.6 remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A physical examination by the Chief Investigator will also take place at this visit and&#xD;
      concomitant medication and any adverse events occurring since receiving the patient&#xD;
      information leaflet will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments will be done at baseline and after 2 weeks of treatment with each&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory. At the baseline visit subjects will have a 48 hr run-in period where they&#xD;
      will be allocated placebo. During this time a 24 hr recording using the NuMact Ambulatory&#xD;
      device wll be taken. This has been included so that treatment effect vs placebo can be&#xD;
      recorded which would strengthen the final analysis and findings. The NuMact ambulatory&#xD;
      activity monitor will be used to assess spontaneous ambulatory activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the 48 hr period the first arm of the study will commence and subjects will be randomly&#xD;
      allocated to receive either Etoricoxib 90 mg once a day or Diclofenac 50 mg three times a&#xD;
      day, which will be prescribed for 2 weeks. At the end of this period (visit 3), a further&#xD;
      NuMact reading will take place and disease status will be assessed using the DAS 28, HAQ VAS&#xD;
      Pain and VAS Fatigue. A home visit will take place to remove the NuMact device with the&#xD;
      patient's consent. This has been written into the protocol because a second reading could&#xD;
      take place should the reading fail at visit 3. At visit 5 the patient will return to the&#xD;
      hospital to start the second arm of treatment where they will cross over to either Etoricoxib&#xD;
      90 mg tonce a day or Diclofenac 50 mg three times a day. They will be prescribed this&#xD;
      medication for two weeks and at visit 6 another NuMact recording will take place and disease&#xD;
      status will be assessed using the DAS 28, HAQ VAS Pain and VAS Fatigue. With the patient's&#xD;
      consent, the device will be removed after 24 hrs at the patient's home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical examination will be carried out at the baseline visit and at visits 3 and 6. It&#xD;
      could be carried out at any time during the study period if considered appropriate by the&#xD;
      physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concomitant medication and therapy and adverse events will be recorded by the Investigator at&#xD;
      each study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A follow-up phone call will be undertaken 2 weeks after the final visit as a safety measure.&#xD;
