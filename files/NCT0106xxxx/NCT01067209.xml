      The overall purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of gastric bypass surgery-induced&#xD;
      weight loss on the heart's function and on fat deposits in the heart muscle.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is a major risk factor for heart failure. Moreover, patients with diabetes and heart&#xD;
      failure have a worse survival than those without diabetes. We know that patients with&#xD;
      diabetes have altered heart metabolism, structure, and function. It is unclear if these&#xD;
      alterations can be ameliorated with weight loss. We would like to learn whether cardiac&#xD;
      metabolism, structure, and function in diabetic patients with heart failure symptoms can be&#xD;
      improved with marked weight loss after gastric bypass surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Day 1. Screening. We will screen subjects with known diabetes or those with a high&#xD;
      likelihood of diabetes who will undergo gastric bypass surgery. We will approach all patients&#xD;
      at the Bariatric Surgery clinic regarding enrollment in our study. If they agree to&#xD;
      participate, they will answer simple questionnaires re: medical history, obesity information,&#xD;
      and MRI/MRS exclusion (see Appendices). We will obtain their permission to review their&#xD;
      medical charts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Day 2. Screening will include a physical examination and phlebotomy for a complete&#xD;
      blood count, oral glucose tolerance test, &amp; comprehensive metabolic profile and a screening&#xD;
      rest and stress echocardiogram. The rest and stress echocardiogram will be used to exclude&#xD;
      cardiac abnormalities other than diastolic dysfunction. Optisonâ„¢ or Definity will be used as&#xD;
      needed for the echocardiograms. We will determine the subjects' fat and fat-free mass using&#xD;
      dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) imaging at the Center for Applied Research Sciences&#xD;
      unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Day 3. Baseline Imaging Studies. Subject preparation. We expect 30 subjects to complete&#xD;
      our study's screening tests and meet our study criteria. The evening before imaging Study&#xD;
      Days 3 &amp; 4, subjects will be admitted to The Center for Applied Research Sciences Intensive&#xD;
      Research Unit in order to standardize their metabolic milieu for their myocardial fat imaging&#xD;
      studies. At 1800, subjects will ingest a standard meal containing a total of ~700 kcal for&#xD;
      the subjects. Carbohydrate, fat, and protein will represent 55, 30, and 15%, respectively, of&#xD;
      total energy intake. At 2000, subjects will ingest a defined liquid formula snack containing&#xD;
      250 kcal, 40 g carbohydrate, 6.1 g fat, and 8.8 g protein (Ensure, Ross Laboratories,&#xD;
      Columbus, OH). After this snack, all subjects will fast until completion of the study the&#xD;
      following day. Subjects will be given a lunch after completing their imaging studies.&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Subjects will be placed in the gantry of the scanner.&#xD;
      Examinations will be performed on the 1.5T scanner using ECG gating, breath-hold, and a chest&#xD;
      array coil This same scanner will be used for 1H-Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). The&#xD;
      MRS protocol is based on a free-breathing, point-resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) sequence with&#xD;
      both ECG and two-dimensional respiratory gating optimized for accuracy and robustness.&#xD;
      Subject care. All subjects will be given a lunch, prepared at the Intensive Research Unit&#xD;
      after imaging is completed. All imaging should be completed by 12PM. If the physician&#xD;
      monitoring the subject determines that the subject would benefit from furosemide 20mg, p.o. x&#xD;
      1, or KCl, p.o. - a 10 day course may be provided (with a follow-up K+ check). Patients'&#xD;
      physicians would be notified of any changes. We request subjects stay on their same medical&#xD;
      regimen throughout the testing period. We recognize that this may not be possible for all&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gastric bypass. Subjects will undergo surgery after Study Day 3. The same surgeon (J.C.E.)&#xD;
      will perform all bypass procedures using standard techniques. Briefly, a small (~20 mL)&#xD;
      proximal gastric pouch will be created by stapling across the stomach, and a 150 cm Roux-Y&#xD;
      limb constructed by transecting the jejunum 30cm distal to the ligament of Treitz and&#xD;
      creating a jejunojejunostomy 150 cm distal to the transection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Day 4. Imaging Studies - 3 months after surgery. Subjects will undergo the same imaging&#xD;
      studies under the same conditions and in the same order as on Study Day 3 except that&#xD;
      subjects on Day 4 will also undergo a resting echocardiogram for diastolic function.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All subjects will have type 2 diabetes or be at risk for type 2 diabetes and have a&#xD;
             BMI&gt;30kg/m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be between the ages of 35 and 70 years, in order to limit the&#xD;
             confounding affect of age on our endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  23 Subjects must also meet the following definition of diastolic dysfunction:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  1) meet Framingham criteria for heart failure (see Appendix),&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  2) have an ejection fraction &gt;45% based on the rest portion of the screening&#xD;
                  echocardiography,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  24 To determine if potential subjects meet these criteria, they will&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  1) be interviewed,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  2) their clinical charts reviewed, by the research study coordinator and/or the&#xD;
                  PI, and&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  3) undergo a history and physical by the PI (Study Day 2) and undergo screening&#xD;
                  studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are &lt;35 or &gt;70 years,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  current smokers, not obese,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  unstable,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  not able to lie flat for the imaging studies,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  not ambulatory,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  unable to give informed consent,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  pregnant, lactating will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Those who have a condition that may masquerade as diastolic heart failure (e.g.&#xD;
             constrictive pericarditis) will be excluded based on the screening echocardiogram;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  those who have atrial flutter or fibrillation,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  evidence of other major systemic diseases (e.g., cancer),&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  an ejection fraction &lt;45%, &gt;class I hypertension or who are taking more than 1&#xD;
             medication (other than a diuretic) for hypertension will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  We will not exclude patients with sleep apnea because data suggest it does not affect&#xD;
             left ventricular (LV) diastolic function, but we will ask about it on a questionnaire&#xD;
             for better phenotyping of the subjects.25&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  We will exclude patients with significant pulmonary hypertension (peak artery&#xD;
             pressure&gt;55mmHg), since most patients with diastolic dysfunction have a pressure lower&#xD;
             than this, and a pressure greater than this may indicate other cardiopulmonary&#xD;
             pathology.&#xD;
