      The purpose of this study is to perform a pilot study to assess the potential use of&#xD;
      Bevacizumab (a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor) in sepsis.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis is responsible for significant morbidity, mortality, and costs to patients in our&#xD;
      healthcare system. The hospital case mortality rate for severe sepsis (sepsis with acute&#xD;
      organ system dysfunction) is between 30-50%,7-12 with an incidence of approximately 751,000&#xD;
      cases and 215,000 deaths nationally per year. The overall cost of care is estimated at $16.7&#xD;
      billion annually in the US.Despite significant advances in medical science, the overall&#xD;
      mortality rate for severe sepsis has not improved substantially over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VEGF signaling and sepsis. VEGF contributes to inflammation and coagulation - the key&#xD;
      elements in sepsis pathophysiology. For example, under in vitro conditions, VEGF induces the&#xD;
      expression of cell adhesion molecules (E-selectin, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1) in endothelial cells&#xD;
      and promotes adhesion of leukocytes. Moreover, VEGF signaling upregulates tissue factor mRNA,&#xD;
      protein and procoagulant activity. Several studies have shown increased circulating levels of&#xD;
      VEGF in patients with sepsis. In one study, maximum VEGF levels were increased in survivors&#xD;
      versus non-survivors in sepsis. In another study of patients with meningococcal meningitis,&#xD;
      elevated VEGF levels were associated with shock and upregulation of IL-1beta, IL-10, IL-12,&#xD;
      complement activation and increased permeability.We have additional human data on 83 patients&#xD;
      demonstrating an association of VEGF with SOFA score, IL-1, and IL-6. Consistent with its&#xD;
      critical role in inflammation, VEGF inhibition using a VEGF trap resulted in attenuation of&#xD;
      plasma interleukin IL-6 and IL-10 levels in a mouse cecal ligation puncture (CLP) model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VEGF signaling is an important determinant of sepsis morbidity and mortality in animal&#xD;
      models. We have recently shown that sepsis is associated with a time-dependent increase in&#xD;
      circulating levels of VEGF in animal and human models of sepsis.2 The overexpression of&#xD;
      sFlt-1 as well as the addition of exogenous sFLT-1 (each binds and neutralizes VEGF) in mice&#xD;
      attenuated lipopolysaccharide- and CLP-mediated mediated morbidity (cardiac dysfunction,&#xD;
      vascular permeability and endothelial activation) and mortality in sepsis. Importantly, these&#xD;
      findings have been reproduced and extended by others.6 The striking and reproducible&#xD;
      reduction in morbidity and mortality make a compelling case for further exploration in human&#xD;
      sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A role for Bevacizumab in treating patients with severe sepsis. There are several advantages&#xD;
      in employing Bevacizumab as a lead agent for inhibiting VEGF signaling in patients with&#xD;
      severe sepsis. First, as a humanized monoclonal antibody, it has a sufficiently long&#xD;
      half-life that it may be given as a single injection in this patient population. Second, it&#xD;
      is already FDA approved for use in patients with certain types of cancer. Thus, there is&#xD;
      extensive knowledge of its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (at least in the latter&#xD;
      population). Moreover, it should not be difficult to obtain permission for use in septic&#xD;
      patients. Third, its chief side effect, namely hypertension, will not be a major concern in&#xD;
      sepsis, since this condition is associated with hypotension.&#xD;
