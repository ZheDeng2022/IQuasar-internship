  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this research study we will start by looking for the highest dose of pyrimethamine that&#xD;
      can be given safely to CLL patients without severe or unmanageable side effects. This dose&#xD;
      will then be used for a larger Phase II study to assess the efficacy of pyrimethamine for the&#xD;
      treatment of CLL/SLL. Pyrimethamine is an antibiotic that is used for the treatment of&#xD;
      certain infections. Previous research studies have shown that pyrimethamine may target a&#xD;
      protein in tumor cells, called STAT3, which may be important for the growth of chronic&#xD;
      lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) cells. Pyrimethamine can kill&#xD;
      CLL/SLL cells in the laboratory, and we are therefore undertaking this study to assess&#xD;
      whether pyrimethamine will result in clinical benefit or tumor responses in CLL in patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      -  Participants will be required to enroll in DFCI Protocol 99-224, the CLL Research&#xD;
           Consortium Tissue Bank, and DFCI Protocol 01-206, Tissue and Data Collection for&#xD;
           Research Studies in Patients with Hematologic Malignancies, Bone Marrow Disorders, and&#xD;
           Normal Donors, or may have blood banked for future use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each treatment cycle lasts 28 days during which time participants will take&#xD;
           pyrimethamine orally once per day. Since we are looking for the highest dose of the&#xD;
           study drug that can be administered safely without severe or unmanageable side effects,&#xD;
           not everyone who participates will receive the same dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The following tests and procedures will be performed at specific time points during&#xD;
           participation in the study: Physical exam, vital signs, blood tests and bone marrow&#xD;
           biopsy. The participant's tumor will be assessed by CT scans of the chest, abdomen and&#xD;
           pelvis prior to the start of the study and at the end of the 1st, 3rd and 6th months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants can continue to receive pyrimethamine as long as they do not have side&#xD;
           effects and their disease does not worsen.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Diagnosed with CLL/SLL based on the standard histologic and immunophenotypic criteria&#xD;
             described in the WHO classification of lymphoid malignancies, including&#xD;
             immunophenotypic confirmation that the tumor cells co-express B cell antigens CD19/20&#xD;
             and CD5. Mantle cell lymphoma should be excluded based on positive staining of the&#xD;
             tumor cells for CD23, or the absence of staining of the tumor cells for cyclin D1 or&#xD;
