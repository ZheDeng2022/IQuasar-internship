    <textblock>
      The primary end point is to evaluate the time to progression after gemcitabine alone versus&#xD;
      Gemcitabine-based combination induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy&#xD;
      in locally advanced pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary end points are to evaluate the disease control rate, overall survival time,&#xD;
      toxicity profile and compliance after induction chemotherapy and concurrent chemoradiotherapy&#xD;
      as well as the disease control rate after inductional chemotherapy alone in locally advanced&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer. Translational research including pharmacogenomic study and biomarker study&#xD;
      will also be done concomitantly.&#xD;

      Patients should be randomized to two study arms stratified by resectability status&#xD;
      (borderline resectable and unresectable) after enrollment. Eligible patients will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned on a 1:1 basis to either of two study groups, using a central randomization&#xD;
      procedure with stratification according to NCCN criteria of resectability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After randomization, induction chemotherapy (ICT) will be administered for 3 cycles ( 3&#xD;
      months). Patients who have radiological evidence of distant dissemination will be shifted to&#xD;
      salvage chemotherapy. Patients who have responsive, stable disease as well as those with&#xD;
      localized progressive disease after ICT will receive concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) 3-4&#xD;
      weeks after the last dose of ICT. Surgical evaluation will be performed 4-6 weeks after the&#xD;
      completion of CCRT. Patients who have respectable disease will undergo surgical resection.&#xD;
      Postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy for 3 cycles ( 3 months) will be given for those who are&#xD;
      considered to have curative resection. Patients who still have unresectable disease or&#xD;
      non-curative resection will receive systemic chemotherapy till disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Arm 1, ICT with gemcitabine ( fixed rate of 10mg/m2/min, 1000mg/m2 on day 1,8,15 every 28&#xD;
      days/cycle) will be administered on a 3-week-on-one-week-off weekly basis. For Arm 2, ICT&#xD;
      with GOFL ( 800mg/m2 gemcitabine at a fixed rate of 10mg/m2/min followed by a 2-hour&#xD;
      oxaliplatin 85mg/m2 and then a 48-hour 3000mg/m2 5-FU and 150 mg/m2 leucovorin on day 1 and&#xD;
      15 every 28 days/cycle) will be given biweekly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After three 3 cycles of ICT, patients without distant metastasis will be given CCRT with&#xD;
      gemcitabine 400mg/m2 2 hrs before RT on day1,8,15,22,29,36. Radiation will be given 180cGy&#xD;
      per day, 5 days a week for 28 fractions to totally 5040cGy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If complete surgical resection is feasible, optimal surgery will be performed 4-6 weeks after&#xD;
      CCRT. If complete surgical resection is impossible, biopsy with or without bypass surgery may&#xD;
      be performed. Patients who have curative surgical resection will receive additional 6 cycles&#xD;
      ( 6 months) of adjuvant chemotherapy ( Arm1, gemcitabine alone; Arm 2, GOFL) within 4 weeks&#xD;
      after surgery and then followed up until tumor progression. Patients who are not feasible for&#xD;
      curative resection, will receive continued chemotherapy (Arm1, gemcitabine alone; Arm2, GOFL)&#xD;
      3-4 weeks after CCRT complete. The regimen will continue till disease progression.&#xD;
