      Raltegravir is the first integrase inhibitor approved for treatment of HIV infected patients&#xD;
      harboring multiresistant viruses. The drug has been proved effective in both trials and&#xD;
      clinical settings, but the long-term efficacy is not described and the effect compared to&#xD;
      treatment in Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) naive patients remains to be&#xD;
      established.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was introduced more than a decade ago and the&#xD;
      therapy has decreased mortality and morbidity of HIV patients dramatically. The first HAART&#xD;
      regimens were combined of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-nucleoside&#xD;
      reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) and protease inhibitors (PIs). Especially the early&#xD;
      regimes carried a substantial risk of failure and subsequent development of resistance to the&#xD;
      three drug classes. Thus there has been a need for development of new drugs with activity&#xD;
      against viruses resistant to the classical HAART regimens either as new drugs from the old&#xD;
      classes without (or with limited) cross resistance to the older compounds or drugs from new&#xD;
      classes with new antiretroviral mechanisms. The optimal choice for salvage therapy for HIV&#xD;
      infected patients has been shown to require at least two, and preferably three, fully active&#xD;
      drugs. Until recently, salvage regimens used to treat patients harbouring multidrug-resistant&#xD;
      HIV generally included only one new agent from the classic drug classes added to an optimized&#xD;
      background therapy which did not contain any fully active agents. This approach, conditioned&#xD;
      by limited drug options, put patients at high risk of virological failure and resistance to&#xD;
      the new agent, as well as to other agents in the same drug classes. A breakthrough has been&#xD;
      the resent development of integrase inhibitors, which is a new class of antiretroviral drugs.&#xD;
      One of these drugs - raltegravir - has demonstrated its activity in patients with virological&#xD;
      failure on classical antiretroviral drugs. In the BENCHMARK randomized clinical trials, which&#xD;
      were conducted in HIV-infected patients with limited treatment options, 62% of patients&#xD;
      taking raltegravir plus optimized background treatment achieved plasma HIV RNA levels &lt;50&#xD;
      copies/mL at week 48. Although the drug - often used together with other new drugs - has been&#xD;
      proved effective in clinical trials and recently in &quot;real life&quot; clinical settings, the&#xD;
      long-term efficacy is not described and the effect compared to treatment in HAART naive&#xD;
      patients remains to be established. In a nationwide cohort of HIV infected patients, we&#xD;
      identified the patients, who initiated raltegravir due to virological failure and a matched&#xD;
      control cohort of patients initiating HAART for the first time. We compared these two cohorts&#xD;
      with respect to virological suppression, gain in CD4 count and time to first change of&#xD;
      initial regimen.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Raltegravir cohort patients: From the Danish HIV Cohort Study (DHCS) we included all&#xD;
             HIV-1 positive patients, who&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. started raltegravir after 1 January 2006 and before 1 July 2009,&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. had been treated with HAART previously&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. had at least two VL tests done prior to initiation of raltegravir treatment,&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. had virological failure prior to start of raltegravir and&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. did not participate in randomized clinical trials on raltegravir. Virological&#xD;
                  failure was defined as VL &gt; 500 copies/ml in the two latest VL tests prior to&#xD;
                  raltegravir initiation while on HAART treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Control cohort patients: From DHCS we identified a control cohort of HIV infected&#xD;
             patients who started HAART for the first time after 1 January 2006 and before 1 July&#xD;
             2009. From this population we extracted two control patients for each raltegravir&#xD;
             patient, each matched by gender, race (Caucasian, Black and other), route of HIV&#xD;
             infection (homosexual, heterosexual, injection drug user (IDU) and other) and age&#xD;
             (intervals of &lt; 20 years, 20 to 30 years, 30 to 40 years, &gt; 50 years).&#xD;
