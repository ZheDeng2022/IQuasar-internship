      Primary Hypothesis: There is no difference in the efficacy of iron replacement by oral or&#xD;
      intravenous route in Inflammatory Bowel Disease patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iron deficiency anaemia is a common problem in people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)&#xD;
      and patients with excessive blood loss from the bowel or heavy menstrual loss. Treatment&#xD;
      options include a blood transfusion, oral iron with (Ferrograd ®) or intravenous iron&#xD;
      replacement with iron sucrose (Venofer®). Iron deficiency anaemia is associated with poor&#xD;
      quality of life, poor concentration span and low energy level. Blood transfusion may improve&#xD;
      symptomatic anaemia quickly but there is a risk of transfusion reaction and blood born&#xD;
      infection transmission. Moreover, packed cells are scarce resource therefore its use needs to&#xD;
      be carefully prioritized. Oral iron supplement has been widely used and it can be purchased&#xD;
      over the counter, however, its efficacy is not known in IBD population. Oral iron is poorly&#xD;
      tolerated with side effects include altered bowel habit, nausea and darken stools, making it&#xD;
      difficult to adhere to. In contrast, intravenous iron therapy with Venofer® has been shown to&#xD;
      replenish iron store and improve anaemia quickly. To date, the safety of Venofer® use has&#xD;
      been supported by its post marketing surveillance. Limitations with intravenous iron&#xD;
      replacement include the need for medical supervision in the setting of limited healthcare&#xD;
      resources; the need for patients to take multiple days off work and the cost of Venofer®.&#xD;
      Currently it is uncertain which method of iron replacement is better. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to compare the efficacy and the cost of oral and intravenous iron replacement in the&#xD;
      setting of iron deficiency anaemia.&#xD;

      1.1 Literature&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iron deficiency anemia is a common and a major management issue in Inflammatory Bowel disease&#xD;
      [1-3]. Moreover, no factor has been identified in predicting recurrent iron deficiency anemia&#xD;
      [4]. Iron deficiency and anemia are well recognized causes of fatigue, poor concentration and&#xD;
      decreased energy level which impact on one's quality of life and ability to maintain&#xD;
      employment or managing activities of daily living [2, 5]. Iron deficiency anemia is&#xD;
      multi-factorial in origin and its causes can be divided into disease or patient origin.&#xD;
      Disease factors include active blood loss from gastrointestinal mucosal ulceration,&#xD;
      impairment of iron absorption if disease affects the proximal small bowels or a history of&#xD;
      extensive small bowel resection. Iron absorption and utilization may also be influenced by&#xD;
      inflammation inducible production of the hepatic origin peptide hormone called hepcidin [5],&#xD;
      Interleukin 10 (IL10) [6] and interleukin 6 (IL 6) [7, 8]. Inflammatory cytokines such as&#xD;
      Tumour Necrosis Factor alpha (TNFa) and IL-6 have been shown to cause anorexia in the animal&#xD;
      model [9]. The major patient factor is dietary aversion of certain food in order to avoid&#xD;
      exacerbation of existing symptom [10, 11].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iron can be replaced either orally or intravenously. To date five studies directly compare&#xD;
      oral versus intravenous iron therapy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Three of&#xD;
      the studies suggested intravenous iron was superior [12-14], one suggested oral iron was&#xD;
      superior [15]and one showed no difference[16]. This confusion is evident by a retrospective&#xD;
      review of a gastroenterology outpatient clinic's experience in detecting and managing iron&#xD;
      deficiency anaemia in both IBD and non IBD patients[17]. Furthermore, there are studies&#xD;
      advocating the concurrent use of Erythropoietin which makes it difficult to draw a definite&#xD;
      conclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have shown that iron deficient without anaemia is associated with reduced cognitive&#xD;
      performance and it is reversible with iron supplementation.(18)19) In combination with other&#xD;
      non specific symptoms such as fatigue and poor concentration span, many clinicians have been&#xD;
      treating iron deficiency before anaemia occurs. Moreover, the World Health Organization (WHO)&#xD;
      estimated the number of iron deficient people to be twice that of diagnosed anaemic people,&#xD;
      (20) therefore, it is more appropriate to use iron deficiency as the inclusion criterion.&#xD;
      This is in contrast with most of the clinical trials examining iron replacement therapy use&#xD;
      iron deficiency anaemia as the inclusion criteria. The approach of stratifying the route of&#xD;
      iron replacement therapy by the degree of anaemia is logical but not evidence based. This&#xD;
      study seeks to investigate the efficacy of intravenous iron versus oral iron replacement in&#xD;
      iron deficient patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone marrow biopsy staining for iron store is the gold standard for assessing iron store but&#xD;
      it is invasive, therefore surrogate serum markers such as ferritin and iron saturation are&#xD;
      used in clinical practice and they have been shown to be accurate.(21) Low ferritin level is&#xD;
      associated with high (78%-100%) specificity and low iron saturation has a high sensitivity&#xD;
      for iron deficiency (59%-88%). (22) Moreover, in anaemic IBD population, low ferritin level&#xD;
      has &gt;90% specificity for iron deficiency. (23) Given some of the IBD patients will have&#xD;
      'functional' iron deficiency with elevated ferritin and CRP and a low iron saturation, we&#xD;
      have decided to use iron saturation &lt;16% and ferritin less than 100ug/L to indicate iron&#xD;
      deficient state. This cut off is consistent with the laboratory standard for University of&#xD;
      Alberta Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 Oral Iron Therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2.1 Oral Iron Adverse Events&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral iron replacement is often poorly tolerated as evident by published studies where the&#xD;
      adverse reaction rate has been reported to be as high as 80% [12], the discontinuation rate&#xD;
      of up to 25% [16, 18]. Less than half of the patients were able to tolerate the prescribed&#xD;
      dose of oral iron [14]. Some reports suggested oral iron therapy is associated with worsening&#xD;
      of IBD disease activity [12], although not consistently [14]. Finally, there is controversy&#xD;
      regarding whether or not oral iron replacement could exacerbate underlying disease through&#xD;
      increased oxidative stress [18].&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2.2. Oral Iron Efficacy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Semrin et al have demonstrated oral iron absorption is significantly impaired in the context&#xD;
      of active Crohn's disease when compared to inactive disease state [7]. In the literature, the&#xD;
      efficacy of oral iron replacement is often defined by an improvement in haemoglobin level by&#xD;
      20g/L or more from baseline and it has been reported to be as high as 89% [15]. It is worth&#xD;
      noting that the baseline haemoglobin in the oral replacement cohort of the study by Gisbert&#xD;
      et al was significantly higher than the intravenous cohort. When using iron studies as an&#xD;
      endpoint, only 60% of oral iron treatment group were not iron deficient after 5 months of as&#xD;
      tolerated dose of oral iron replacement [14].&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3 Intravenous Iron Therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3.1 Intravenous Iron Adverse Events&#xD;
&#xD;
      The alternative to oral iron is intravenous iron replacement and its formulation has changed&#xD;
      over time. Chertow et al reviewed the US FDA intravenous iron adverse event data between&#xD;
      2001-2003 and confirmed a up to 20 times higher rate of life threatening adverse events with&#xD;
      the high molecular weight iron dextran than iron sucrose [19]. Iron sucrose (1.4+/- 0.5g) has&#xD;
      been shown to increase HB by 20g/L and/or normalizing haemoglobin in up to 91% of the cohort&#xD;
      within 12 weeks of treatment [20]. Studies have shown intravenous iron therapy is better&#xD;
      tolerated than oral iron, with a lower discontinuation rate [13] and a definite improvement&#xD;
      in the serum ferritin [16]. Intravenous iron replacement ensures adequate total iron&#xD;
      replacement because there isn't an issue with compliance and it is independent from&#xD;
      intestinal absorption. Iron sucrose has been shown to be efficacious when oral iron&#xD;
      replacement is inadequate or intolerable [20]. The disadvantages of intravenous iron include&#xD;
      it being time consuming for the patient, much more expensive than the oral formulation and&#xD;
      the ancillary cost. It is uncertain what the true cost of intravenous iron replacement is&#xD;
      without factoring in efficacy, compliance and the lack of side effect. Intravenous iron usage&#xD;
      has been shown to be cost effective in chronic renal failure patients on dialysis who has&#xD;
      insufficient iron stores on maximum tolerated oral supplements [21].&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3.2 Intravenous Iron Efficacy&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been five direct comparative oral versus intravenous iron replacement studies. The&#xD;
      earlier comparative study involved smaller number of subjects, 19 patients, with short&#xD;
      treatment duration of 2 weeks [12] and 6 weeks [16] and in one study, the baseline entry&#xD;
      criterion between the two groups were different [15]. Appendix one summarises these studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.4 Potential Aggravating Effects of Iron Therapy on Inflammatory Bowel Disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of oral iron in causing intestinal oxidative stress and subsequently increase the&#xD;
      risk of colorectal dysplasia is a controversial one. Lund et al used 18 healthy volunteers to&#xD;
      demonstrate that unabsorbed dietary iron is associated with a 40% increase in stool free&#xD;
      radicals formation and carcinogens production [22]. The hypothesis that dietary iron can&#xD;
      serve as a catalyst in the formation of highly reactive radical via the Fenton reaction [23,&#xD;
      24] and thereby causing cellular damage [25] and contributing to carcinogenesis has been&#xD;
      demonstrated in animal models [26, 27]. A more recent mice model by Seril et al demonstrated&#xD;
      the superiority of an intraperitoneal iron supplementation in replenishing splenic iron store&#xD;
      without an increase in colorectal dysplasia rate compared to mice fed oral iron supplements&#xD;
      [28]. Interestingly, there are conflicting reports regarding the role of intravenous iron&#xD;
      replacement and the increase in plasma oxidative stress [12, 29] and the significance of this&#xD;
      data is unknown. Currently, limited human literature is available addressing this issue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no difference in the efficacy of iron replacement by oral or intravenous route in&#xD;
      IBD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no difference in the tolerability of oral and intravenous iron therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The route of iron replacement does not impact on the colonic bacterial flora composition, the&#xD;
      underlying IBD state and the oxidative stress of the colonic mucosa as determined by colonic&#xD;
      biopsies analyzing for endoplasmic reticulum stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral iron replacement therapy is a cheap and efficacious way of replacing iron compare to&#xD;
      intravenous replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;

      Open label Randomised Control Trial and observer blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4 Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible all comers will be randomized into either IV or PO iron therapy in a 1:1 ratio.&#xD;

      maintain the randomization code.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1 Trial Treatment/ Duration&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 Dose determination:-&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total amount of intravenous iron given is calculated by Ganzoni Equation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iron dose (mg) = body weight (kg) x (ideal Hb - actual Hb) x 0.24 + 15mg/kg of iron depot&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3 Iron Sucrose: Administered by IV infusion (dilute 5 mL (equiv. Fe 100 mg) in 100ml of&#xD;
      NaCl 0.9%). Maximum amount of iron sucrose is 300mg per infusion per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4 Oral iron: 200mg equivalent of elemental iron is given twice a day for 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.5 Discontinuation if&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  withdrawal of consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Significant adverse event such as hypersensitivity reaction, dyspnoea and myalgia with&#xD;
           iron sucrose. (see appendix 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
