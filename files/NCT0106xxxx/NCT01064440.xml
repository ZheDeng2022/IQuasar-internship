  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the absence of revascularization options, most patients with CLI require amputation within&#xD;
      6 months. Patients requiring major amputation face a diminished quality of life, an&#xD;
      unfavorable natural history and need extensive resources for their post-amputation&#xD;
      rehabilitation and course. The 1-year amputation-free survival rate for patients diagnosed&#xD;
      with CLI is 45%; the mortality rate is approximately 25% and may be as high as 45% in those&#xD;
      who have undergone amputation. Management of this end-stage disease process consumes a&#xD;
      significant amount of healthcare resources. Clearly, new therapeutic approaches are required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) has been shown to be a potent angiogenic growth factor&#xD;
      stimulating the growth of endothelial cells and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells.&#xD;
      Because of its pluripotent capabilities, increasing the availability of HGF in ischemic&#xD;
      tissues to achieve therapeutic angiogenesis has been a growing area of research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will use VM202, which is a DNA plasmid that contains novel genomic cDNA hybrid&#xD;
      human HGF coding sequence (HGF-X7) expressing two isoforms of HGF, HGF 728 and HGF 723. As&#xD;
      there are currently no approved drugs that can reverse CLI and as most patients have&#xD;
      exhausted surgical and endovascular intervention options, inducing angiogenesis in the&#xD;
      affected limb with VM202 may result in an increase in tissue perfusion, which, in turn&#xD;
      improve wound healing, reduce pain and improve limb salvage rates.&#xD;
