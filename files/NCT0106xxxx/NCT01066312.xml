    <textblock>
      Manual Muscle Testing (MMT) practiced by over a million practitioners worldwide. However,&#xD;
      it's accuracy under varying levels of blindness has not yet been considered. This study will&#xD;
      test this accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypothesis: MMT can accurately distinguish congruent from incongruent statements. Also,&#xD;
      the accuracy of MMT is positively correlated with practitioner experience.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Manual Muscle Testing is a non-invasive assessment tool used by millions of healthcare&#xD;
      practitioners worldwide for a variety of purposes. First described in the literature by&#xD;
      Lovett and Wight in 1915, MMT was originally used to assess muscular weakness in polio&#xD;
      victims. In 1949, physiotherapists Kendall and Kendall refined MMT into an art and science&#xD;
      with the publication of their benchmark text, Muscles: Testing and Function. This type of MMT&#xD;
      is still used today to assess neuromuscular integrity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the 1960's, a different use for MMT was described by Dr. George Goodheart. In Goodheart's&#xD;
      technique, called Applied Kinesiology (AK), MMT is used to evaluate a variety of additional&#xD;
      functions of the body, apart from neuromuscular integrity. From Goodheart's work, many&#xD;
      different techniques have emerged which use this second type of MMT. Moreover, it is&#xD;
      estimated that over one million healthcare practitioners worldwide use this type of MMT:&#xD;
      medical doctors, dentists, chiropractors, osteopaths, physiotherapists, other health&#xD;
      professionals - plus even some lay-persons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result of this divergence, there exists two very different forms of MMT: (1) orthopaedic&#xD;
      muscle testing to quantify muscle strength and asses neurological integrity, and (2) the&#xD;
      other type of muscle testing - which called be called &quot;muscle response testing&quot; which is used&#xD;
      to obtain additional information about a patient. What that information is depends upon the&#xD;
      MMT system being used and what information is sought. It is this latter form of MMT that this&#xD;
      proposed study will investigate. Therefore, for the remainder of this application, the term&#xD;
      &quot;MMT&quot; will be used to refer only to the second type (&quot;muscle response testing&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The basic premise of MMT is that when there is some aberrant nervous system input to a&#xD;
      muscle, it is less likely to be able to resist an external force. During a manual muscle&#xD;
      test, an external force is applied to one muscle or group of muscles which at first causes an&#xD;
      isometric then an eccentric contraction. Consequently, the muscle being tested is labelled&#xD;
      &quot;weak&quot; or &quot;strong&quot; based on its ability to resist this external force.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of different techniques use MMT to test the body's physiological response to&#xD;
      semantic stimuli, which may have both cognitive and emotional components. Monti et al. found&#xD;
      that a MMT following congruent statements yielded significantly different results compared to&#xD;
      a MMT following incongruent statements. A congruent statement is one that the person believes&#xD;
      is true. An incongruent statement is one the person believes is false. The study by Monti et&#xD;
      al. used self-referential statements similar to this study design, however they used&#xD;
      statements such as, &quot;My name is (insert one's name)&quot;. One criticism of using this type of&#xD;
      self-referential statements is that in all likelihood both the muscle tester and the muscle&#xD;
      testee know the verity of the statement, therefore, they are both unblinded, which may have&#xD;
      introduced biased. While it is generally accepted by those who use this assessment tool that&#xD;
      some bias exists in MMT, little is currently known about the degree of this bias. Therefore&#xD;
      the main objective of this study is to investigate the accuracy of MMT to distinguish&#xD;
      congruent from incongruent statements under varying degrees of blindness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A further aim of this study are to explore if practitioner experience correlate with MMT&#xD;
      accuracy. Caruso and Leisman reported greater MMT accuracy in experienced practitioners&#xD;
      compared to inexperienced practitioners. Therefore, this study will test the reproducibility&#xD;
      of these findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be two groups of participants selected for this study: (1) Practitioners, and (2)&#xD;
      Testees - where the Practitioner will perform MMT on the Testee as the Testee speaks a&#xD;
      statement. The Testee will know if s/he is speaking a true or false statement. However, for&#xD;
      some statements, the Practitioner will be blind to the verity of the statement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results will be analysed for percent correct - that is, percent of muscle tests which&#xD;
      accurately predicted the verity of the spoken statement.&#xD;
