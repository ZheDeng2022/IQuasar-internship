      Hema e-chart is an electronic case record that can be changed in real time and is based on&#xD;
      the chronological organisation of the infective events and the therapies prescribed. It&#xD;
      allows the collection of all personal, epidemiological, diagnostic and therapeutic data&#xD;
      pertaining to the patient, processing it and analysing the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims and objectives of the project&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this registry are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess how many suspected fungal-related febrile episodes identify an infective&#xD;
           fungal agent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To have a clear view of the diagnostic and therapeutic actions in the management of&#xD;
           onco-haematological patients with suspected fungal-related febrile episodes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the impact of anti-fungal therapy on the timing of chemotherapy and transplant&#xD;
           planning&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perform drug-epidemiology relationship analyses, observe toxicity and interactions with&#xD;
           antifungal therapies by means of the creation of a national database of fungal&#xD;
           infections in patients affected by malignant haemopathies&#xD;

      Introduction Problems with infections in onco-haematological patients have assumed ever&#xD;
      increasing importance over recent years, with relation to the development of management&#xD;
      principles of the various clinical entities. Indeed, infections are primarily correlated with&#xD;
      reduced immunocompetence (both cellular and humoral immunity) following both intensive&#xD;
      chemotherapy and the use of immunosuppressant drugs during allotransplantation procedures.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the common haematological disorders (i.e. acute or chronic myeloid and lymphoid&#xD;
      leukaemia, lymphoma, myeloma etc) and the treatments required for such diseases contribute&#xD;
      towards mediating and modulating the risk of infection. Among the various pathogens&#xD;
      responsible for infections in onco-haematological patients, fungi still represent a problem&#xD;
      for diagnosis and, despite the current therapeutic options, contribute significantly towards&#xD;
      transplant-related mortality. The various candidaemias account for 30-40% of deaths, invasive&#xD;
      aspergillosis for 50-60%, and 75% of deaths are accounted for by infections caused by&#xD;
      zygomycetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fungal agents include both the yeasts (e.g. Candida) and the moulds (e.g. Aspergillus,&#xD;
      Zygomycetes); however over recent years, a different epidemiological trend has been observed&#xD;
      between the aforementioned macro-categories of etiological agents: while there has been a&#xD;
      progressive reduction in the epidemiological and clinical burden caused by Candida spp&#xD;
      infections, the opposite trend has been observed for those caused by moulds, Aspergillus spp.&#xD;
      and so on. Nevertheless, all clinicians are well aware of this epidemiological development&#xD;
      the variables associated with risk and the real incidence of fungal infections in patients&#xD;
      with malignant haemopathies and/or subjected to transplant are not entirely known. A recent&#xD;
      multicentre retrospective study by the GIMEMA group assessed mould infections in patients&#xD;
      with malignant haemopathies over a 10 year period. This study showed that 6-7% of patients&#xD;
      with acute leukaemia can develop a mould infection during one of the various stages of the&#xD;
      disease (onset of remission, relapse, rescue therapy, etc). Despite the undoubted use of this&#xD;
      data as a first assessment of the magnitude of the problem, a more thorough epidemiological&#xD;
      investigation appears in need, above all within the context of being able to plan the correct&#xD;
      decisional procedure in relation to treatment, independently from the documentation of the&#xD;
      infection. Secondly, an analysis of the different diagnostic approaches of the individual&#xD;
      specialists, in terms of disease definitions and diagnostic work-up just as with their&#xD;
      therapeutic choices, can contribute towards overcoming the high level of managerial&#xD;
      empiricism still widespread within this medical sector.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information which can be gathered from a study of this nature can prove useful for&#xD;
      deducing the correct diagnostic approach and a suitable therapeutic decision, in day to day&#xD;
      clinical practice. Hence, an integrated, computerised system, capable of recording the&#xD;
      various different aspects, can certainly be of help to the haematology specialist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims and objectives of the project&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this registry are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to assess how many suspected fungal-related febrile episodes identify an infective&#xD;
           fungal agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to have a clear view of the diagnostic and therapeutic actions in the management of&#xD;
           onco-haematological patients with suspected fungal-related febrile episodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to assess the impact of anti-fungal therapy on the timing of chemotherapy and transplant&#xD;
           planning&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. perform drug-epidemiology relationship analyses, observe toxicity and interactions with&#xD;
           antifungal therapies by means of the creation of a national database of fungal&#xD;
           infections in patients affected by malignant haemopathies&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A multicentre, prospective registry for monitoring invasive fungal infections in&#xD;
           onco-haematological patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Registration criteria: patients with newly diagnosed malignant haematological diseases&#xD;
           (acute and chronic myeloid and lymphoid leukaemia, multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin's and&#xD;
           Hodgkin's lymphoma, aplastic anaemia, myelodysplastic syndromes), or patients who, as a&#xD;
           result of onco-haematological pathologies, have undergone allogenic or autologous&#xD;
           haematopoietic cell transplants, and have ongoing febrile episodes . The recording of&#xD;
           consecutive febrile events is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data collection for each individual patient will be performed according to the method&#xD;
           shown in the enclosed flow chart. In the case of a new episode for an existing patient,&#xD;
           said new episode will be recorded in the same case record as a new event. All collected&#xD;

           informed consent, which will be obtained from each patient participating in this health&#xD;
           survey.&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Hema e-chart is a non-interventional registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion of patients in any given therapeutic strategy is not decided in advance, but&#xD;
      falls within normal clinical practice, and the decision to prescribe any medication is&#xD;
      entirely independent from that of including the patient in the health survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Prior to its application, the plan will be submitted to the Ethics Committees of the&#xD;
      various participating centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data registration Hema e-chart is an electronic case record that can be changed in real time&#xD;
      and is based on the chronological organisation of the infective events and the therapies&#xD;
      prescribed. It allows the collection of all personal, epidemiological, diagnostic and&#xD;
      therapeutic data pertaining to the patient, processing it and analysing the results. (see&#xD;
      appendix).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This case record is located on a site with access controlled by user ID and Password Data&#xD;
      registration will take place according to the method shown in the enclosed flow-chart&#xD;
&#xD;
      APPENDIX Hema e-chart Software The Hema e-chart software has been designed to be used in&#xD;
      multiple specialised health centres. A configuration function allows automatic recognition of&#xD;
      the centre to which the user submitting their access credentials belongs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data is structured according to the following general outline:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patents basic personal data Description of the basic pathology Clinical parameters&#xD;
      (neutrophils, temperature, etc) Disease type Type of treatment (1st line, 2nd line etc.)&#xD;
      Drugs used Antibiotics Antivirals Antineoplastics Corticosteroids Immunomodulators Cytokines&#xD;
      Renal function (calculated automatically as a function of creatinine levels) Hepatic function&#xD;
      Diagnosis of fungal infection Chemical factors Microbiological factors Invasive tests Name of&#xD;
      the fungal agent identified Site of infection Antifungal prophylaxis Antifungal agent&#xD;
      selected Dosage Mode of administration Antifungal therapy Antifungal agent selected Dosage&#xD;
      Mode of administration Outcome Outcome of the treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete response (complete resolution of signs and symptoms, normalisation of any&#xD;
           instrumental and/or mycological tests)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Partial response (significant clinical improvement in both signs and symptoms and in any&#xD;
           instrumental and/or mycological tests).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physician's evaluation of the treatment Investigators comments Tolerability of the antifungal&#xD;
      therapy Safety of the antifungal therapy Monitoring of any drug interactions&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Hema e-chart structure allows all the data contained in the case record to be altered and&#xD;
      saved up to three times per day, while maintaining a complete history of all changes made.&#xD;
      This way it is possible to follow the patient's progress, the treatments performed, the&#xD;
      clinical tests requested, in detail, and then be able to assess any correlations existing&#xD;
      between the actions undertaken and the effects obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this reason, the software is supplied with various graphical tools for easier evaluation&#xD;
      of the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same patient may be recorded several times in the study, if they incur several febrile&#xD;
      events within the time period. Data registration allows use of the same personal details so&#xD;
      as to aid consultation of the data.&#xD;
