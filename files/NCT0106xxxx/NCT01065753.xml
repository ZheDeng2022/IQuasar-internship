      Central obesity, core of metabolic syndrome, has been recognized as one of the rooting&#xD;
      factors for development of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Although efforts have been&#xD;
      devoted to the studies of central obesity and/or metabolic syndrome, much remained unknown as&#xD;
      to how obesity influences cellular as well as cardiac functions, what is the central&#xD;
      regulation of one's body weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weight loss is an undisputed way to improve cardiovascular and metabolic disorders in obese&#xD;
      individuals. Previous studies have demonstrated that weight loss by 5% of initial weight&#xD;
      universally provide substantial benefits in these subjects. However, there are little&#xD;
      integrated research teams, composed of different disciplines, share common weight reduction&#xD;
      program to look at different aspects of weight reduction in non-diabetic individuals with&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome. The significances of this proposal we plan to target, namely Rho kinase&#xD;
      activity from peripheral leukocyte, several cardiac functions measured by noninvasive&#xD;
      technique (VP-2000) and MRI, circulating brain-derived neurotrophic factors (BDNF) levels,&#xD;
      are fully explained detailed in each sub-proposal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to accomplish this integrated proposal, we will form research teams including&#xD;
      endocrinologists, cardiologists, radiologists, and a coordinating data center. We pan to&#xD;
      recruit 40 non-diabetic individuals with metabolic syndrome to participate this 12-16 weeks&#xD;
      weight reduction program. Twenty-five age, sex matched non-diabetes lean will be served as&#xD;
      controls. Oral glucose tolerance test, fasting blood obtained, noninvasive vascular and MRI&#xD;
      examinations will be applied before and after weight reduction program in those achieving at&#xD;
      least 5% loss of initial weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, this study will investigate the effects of weight loss on (1) Rho kinase activity&#xD;
      obtained from peripheral leukocyte; (2). Aortic stiffness, central aortic pressure and&#xD;
      hemodynamic by a noninvasive vascular profiling system (VP-2000); (3) Brain function&#xD;
      specifically reflecting by circulating BDNF; (4). Aortic elastic properties and left&#xD;
      ventricular function by using MRI examinations, in non-diabetic individuals of metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Obesity, in particular central obesity, has been one of the important documented risk factors&#xD;
      for development of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Recent re-delineated various versions&#xD;
      of definitions of metabolic syndrome, has fueled further the critical involvement of central&#xD;
      adiposity in these disorders through several facets, including many increased circulating&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokines, directly or indirectly linking to visceral adipose tissue&#xD;
      expressions. Although lots of efforts have been devoted to the studies of central obesity&#xD;
      and/or metabolic syndrome, much remained unknown as to how obesity affect cellular as well as&#xD;
      cardiac function, what is the central regulation of one's body weight, and how to measure fat&#xD;
      in visceral organs precisely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weight loss is an undisputed way to improve cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. Both a&#xD;
      recent review article and data from us demonstrated that only weight loss by 5% of initial&#xD;
      weight universally delivered benefits on obese individuals. However, there is little&#xD;
      integrated research teams from different disciplines share common weight reduction protocol&#xD;
      and look at different aspects of weight reduction in non-diabetic individuals with metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome. The significances of this proposal we plan to target are explained in detail in&#xD;
      each sub-proposal. However, we would like to make a briefing description here.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. . Rho kinase (ROCK) is a serine/threonine kinase that mediates the downstream signaling&#xD;
           of the small guanosine triphosphate- binding protein, Rho, on the actin cytoskeleton. In&#xD;
           mostly animal models, the inhibition of ROCK ameliorates many cardiovascular conditions,&#xD;
           including hypertension, atherosclerosis, myocardial fibrosis, and stroke. Recent study&#xD;
           from Taiwan showed that ROCK activity is increased in patients with metabolic syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. . Obese and overweight individuals have increased levels of arterial stiffness which is&#xD;
           a measure of aortic and large vessel distensibility or compliance. Weight loss could&#xD;
           induce significant reduction in sympathetic activity and blood pressure. However, little&#xD;
           is known as whether weight loss can improve arterial stiffness, central aortic blood&#xD;
           pressure and related hemodynamics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. . Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), recently reported related to Alzheimer's&#xD;
           disease, is present in brain tissues extensively. It is also noted that low circulating&#xD;
           level of BDNF was associated with impaired glucose metabolism, and might be associated&#xD;
           higher BMI or body fat. We are interesting in effect of weight reduction on circulating&#xD;
           BDNF values in non-diabetic subjects with metabolic syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. . Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the heart is frequently used and can provide&#xD;
           accurate and reproducible measurement of LV mass, volumes, systolic function and aortic&#xD;
           pulse velocity. Although echo-cardiography has been applied to study effect of weight&#xD;
           loss on cardiac function, there has been no study by using cardiac MRI to measure cine&#xD;
           images of cardiac function and related variables before and after weight reduction in&#xD;
           non-diabetic subjects with metabolic syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to accomplish this integrated proposal, we will formulate research teams including&#xD;
      endocrinologists, cardiologists, radiologists, and a data center, coordinated by a PhD&#xD;
      researcher (infra-structure as described below). We will recruit 40 non-diabetic individuals&#xD;
      with metabolic syndrome (fulfilled the criteria from IDF, 2006 and DOH of Taiwan).&#xD;
      Twenty-five age, sex matched non-diabetes lean will be served as controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written informed consent will be obtained from each subject before being enrolled into the&#xD;
      study after approval from IRB of Taichung VGH, Taichung, Taiwan. This weight reduction&#xD;
      program will be assisted by experienced dieticians and sports experts, all of whom we had&#xD;
      collaborated and published article previously. This program will last for 12-16 weeks with&#xD;
      every participants join together courses 4 hours per week. Each participant will be&#xD;
      introduced a dietary plan based on a caloric reduction of 1200 Kcal/day from the values&#xD;
      thought necessary to maintain their usual weight. Subject will be asked to follow dietary&#xD;
      advice and their eating habit will be reviewed by dietician at the time of their weekly&#xD;
      visit. Activity levels will be encouraged to reach 30 min each day and at least 5 days a&#xD;
      week. During each visit, weight of each participant will be recorded and announced. Meals&#xD;
      replacement may considered for those did not get much improvement during weekly monitoring&#xD;
      since recent report indicated that meals replacement may provide certain help in reducing&#xD;
      body weight. We are confident that adequate weight reduction (at least 5% of initial weight)&#xD;
      and good compliance will be achieved given our previous experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In aggregate, this study will investigate the effects of weight loss on (1) Rho kinase&#xD;
      activity obtained from peripheral leukocyte (2). Aortic stiffness, central aortic pressure&#xD;
      and hemodynamic by a noninvasive technique (3) Brain function specifically reflecting by&#xD;
      circulating BDNF levels (4). Aortic elastic properties and left ventricular function by using&#xD;
      MRI examinations, in non-diabetic individuals of metabolic syndrome. Findings from this&#xD;
      integrated proposal will provide valuable information as mild to moderate weight loss (5% of&#xD;
      initial body weight) in cellular, cardiac and central nervous system in additional to&#xD;
      well-known effects on lipids, inflammatory cytokines and insulin resistance in non-diabetic&#xD;
      subjects with metabolic syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up- Subjects received physical check up, fasting blood tests and OGTT 6 and 12 months&#xD;
      after the end of study.&#xD;
