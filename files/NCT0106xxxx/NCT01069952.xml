  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of deep brain stimulation in treating people&#xD;
      with several and otherwise treatment-resistant depression.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the availability of effective treatments, a substantial portion of patients fail to&#xD;
      recover from episodes of depression. Assuming a conservative rate of 20%, and given the&#xD;
      prevalence of major depression in the general population, over 3.5 million Americans would be&#xD;
      expected to manifest refractory illness if all those with depression received treatment.&#xD;
      Although rarely used in the U.S., neurosurgical approaches to severely refractory depression&#xD;
      have shown efficacy in a number of uncontrolled studies, primarily from European&#xD;
      investigators. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a procedure that involves the use of thin&#xD;
      wires to carry electric current to parts of the brain associated with producing depression&#xD;
      symptoms. DBS has been effectively and safely used to treat movement disorders, such as&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease, and may be beneficial in reducing depression symptom severity. This&#xD;
      study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of DBS in treating people with severe and&#xD;
      treatment-resistant depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participation through follow-up will last up to three years. Participants will be&#xD;
      allowed to remain on any pre-surgical medications or behavioral therapy programs throughout&#xD;
      the study. Before surgery, all participants will undergo a series of initial tests and&#xD;
      examinations that will include a physical and neurological examination; laboratory testing to&#xD;
      screen for significant hematologic, hepatic, renal or endocrine abnormalities; and detailed&#xD;
      psychological testing including tests of perception, learning, and memory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implantation of all devices will be preformed at a single session. The patient will undergo&#xD;
      local anesthesia for the implantation of the leads, and the implanted pulse generator will be&#xD;
      implanted under general anesthesia. On the day of the surgery, participants will have a metal&#xD;
      frame fixed to their heads for support during surgery. Using coordinates individually&#xD;
      determined by preoperative MRI, a pair of tetrapolar leads will be inserted into the anterior&#xD;
      limb of each internal capsule and fixed to the skull with a burr hole ring and cap. The leads&#xD;
      will be inserted so that the stimulation sites span the dorsal-ventral extent of the anterior&#xD;
      capsule or target the ventral half of the anterior capsule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After placement of the DBS system, the patient will be admitted to the hospital for overnight&#xD;
      evaluation for possible complications of the procedure, including possible hemorrhage or&#xD;
      infection. Postoperative evaluation will consist of physical and neurological examinations,&#xD;
      postoperative CBC, electrolyte panel, plain x-ray studies of head, neck, and chest including&#xD;
      a standard shunt series to ensure integrity of connections and to document positioning of&#xD;
      stimulating hardware. A head CT scan will be obtained within 24 hours postoperatively to&#xD;
      monitor for possible postoperative intracranial hemorrhage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If none of the above complications occur, the patient will be discharged home the following&#xD;
      day with the DBS system off to allow resolution of the cellular reactions to electrode&#xD;
      placement. Three weeks after placement of the DBS system, the patient will return to being&#xD;
      the outpatient phase of testing the effects of stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the intensive outpatient phase of the study, each of the outpatient visits will last&#xD;
      approximately two hours. These are anticipated to occur at from 1 to 5 day intervals. On each&#xD;
      day, we will do a brief clinical interview and obtain structured ratings of depressive&#xD;
      symptoms, mood and affect, possible side effects, and cognition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the two year study, patients will be given the choice of continued DBS,&#xD;
      for a total of three years after implantation, or until the stimulator batteries fail.&#xD;
      Patients will also be offered alternative treatment, outside of this study, including&#xD;
      anterior capsulotomy, depending on availability given the patient's financial circumstances&#xD;
      and insurance coverage, or further conventional therapy. Long-term patient follow-up will&#xD;
      continue indefinitely where possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this study, patients will also be invited to undergo a series of three Positron&#xD;
      Emission Tomography (PET) scans under a separate IRB protocol at Massachusetts General&#xD;
      Hospital, to assess the effects of capsular stimulation on activity in brain circuits&#xD;
      implicated in depression. Subjects' participation in this separate protocol is not a&#xD;
      condition for entering the DBS study.&#xD;
