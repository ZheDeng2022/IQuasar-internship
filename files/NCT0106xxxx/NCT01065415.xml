      The accurate staging is an essential part for the treatment and prognosis of non-small-cell&#xD;
      lung cancer (NSCLC). Whole body MR imaging proved to be effective in staging of NSCLC as much&#xD;
      as PET/CT. And there were organs of strength for each modality in the detection of&#xD;
      metastasis. Therefore, integrated approach using whole body MR and PET would be more&#xD;
      beneficial for the accurate staging of lung cancer with improved diagnostic efficacies and&#xD;
      reduced radiation exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this project is to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of side-by-side reading of&#xD;
      whole-body magnetic resonance imaging/ positron emission tomography (MRI/PET) and to compare&#xD;
      with that of whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (WB MRI) alone and that of integrated&#xD;
      PET/CT in determining the stage of NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with pathologically-proven NSCLC will be prospectively enrolled, if they are&#xD;
      considered as surgical candidates for the treatment of lung cancer through conventional&#xD;
      methods of staging, i.e. history taking, physical examination, blood tests, bronchoscopy, and&#xD;
      enhanced chest CT scans. PET/CT will be routinely performed for the staging of lung cancer in&#xD;
      our institution. For the purpose of this study, whole body MRI will be performed for these&#xD;
      patients within 3 days from the date of acquisition of PET/CT. The results of TNM staging&#xD;
      from each modality will be collected prospectively and their efficacies can be calculated&#xD;
      based on the reference standards. Reference standards of T and N staging will be surgically&#xD;
      confirmed. And M staging can be confirmed by biopsy, other imaging modalities, or follow-up&#xD;
      more than 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic efficacies of coregistered MRI/PET can be evaluated with the comparison from the&#xD;
      consecutive two-arm enrollment with random assignment of control group and study group as&#xD;
      follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  control group: routine staging work-up with chest CT, PET/CT, and brain MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  study group: routine staging work-up plus whole body MRI for Coregistered MRI/PET&#xD;

      Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 75 to 80% of all lung cancers, and is&#xD;
      currently the leading cause of tumor-related deaths (1). Optimal lung cancer treatment relies&#xD;
      on accurate disease staging, which is based on tumor size and extent, regional nodal&#xD;
      involvement, and the presence of metastasis. Although thoracic CT has been considered the&#xD;
      standard modality of choice for assessing intrathoracic spread of lung cancer (2), no&#xD;
      consensus has been reached concerning metastasis evaluation. [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose&#xD;
      (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) was introduced and developed as an integrated&#xD;
      modality for accurate nodal staging and for metastatic lesion detection in the whole body&#xD;
      (WB) (3-9). Currently, integrated PET/CT, by providing both morphologic and metabolic&#xD;
      features, appears to have achieved better efficacy in staging lung cancer than CT alone or&#xD;
      PET alone (8, 10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whole body magnetic resonance imaging (WB MRI) has become feasible and enables fast scan&#xD;
      throughout the body (11-13). This technique is based on a real-time gradient-echo imaging and&#xD;
      sliding table platform (rolling table concept, which eliminates time-consuming repositioning&#xD;
      of patients and surface coils). MRI scanners of the latest generation use high field MRI&#xD;
      units of &gt; 1.5 Tesla (T), and are reported to have upgraded capabilities in terms of temporal&#xD;
      and spatial resolution due to improved signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) under high&#xD;
      magnetic-field strength conditions (14, 15).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because both integrated PET/CT and WB MRI can provide WB imaging, both modalities are used&#xD;
      for staging in patients with a malignant condition. According to a report (16), the&#xD;
      diagnostic efficacy of PET/CT is superior to WB MRI for T and N staging and similar to WB MRI&#xD;
      for detecting metastases. However, according to another study (17), WB MRI showed better&#xD;
      sensitivity than PET/CT for detecting metastatic lesions. In these studies (16, 17), in which&#xD;
      a 1.5T MR unit was used, the regional nodal or metastatic lesions were from various types of&#xD;
      primary malignancies with a wide range of tumor stages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently we published a paper regarding the diagnostic efficacy comparison for determining&#xD;
      TNM stages of integrated PET/CT and 3T WB MRI in patients with an NSCLC (18). In this study,&#xD;
      we found that both PET/CT and 3T whole body MRI appear to provide acceptable accuracy and&#xD;
      comparable efficacy for non-small cell lung cancer staging, but in M stage determination,&#xD;
      each modality has its own advantages. Namely, WB MRI is more useful for detecting brain and&#xD;
      hepatic metastases, whereas PET/CT for lymph node and soft-tissue metastases. Therefore, we&#xD;
      suggested whole body MR/PET should be the future imaging modality for NSCLC staging&#xD;
      especially for M staging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although PET/CT scanners have quickly become established, development of MRI/PET has been&#xD;
      slower, due to the additional challenge of developing dual-modality systems that avoid&#xD;
      deleterious interactions caused by the high magnetic field environment of the MRI scanner and&#xD;
      radiofrequency (RF) interference between the PET and MRI systems. At this moment, MRI/PET is&#xD;
      still under development and is used only in small animal study (19). Thus, the purpose of&#xD;
      this research is to provide clinical corroborating data to show how effective future MRI/PET&#xD;
      will be in human use especially in patients with NSCLC by providing the efficiency of&#xD;
      side-by-side reading of WB MRI/PET as compared to PET/CT.&#xD;
