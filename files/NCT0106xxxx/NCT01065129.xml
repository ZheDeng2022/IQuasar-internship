      Our main objectives are to determine the optimal dose and schedule of plerixafor + G-CSF and&#xD;
      azacitidine in patients with MDS and determine the safety and tolerability of plerixafor +&#xD;
      G-CSF and azacitidine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The interaction of normal stem cells with the bone marrow microenvironment is mediated by a&#xD;
      number of factors. These interactions have been implicated in protecting malignant&#xD;
      hematopoietic cells from spontaneous apoptosis and genotoxic stresses such as chemotherapy.&#xD;
      Key elements are CXCR4, which is expressed on normal stem cells and leukemic blasts, and its&#xD;
      ligand, stromal derived factor 1 (SDF-1) expressed by bone marrow stromal cells and&#xD;
      osteoblasts. The CXCR4/SDF-1 axis is essential for homing, retention and mobilization of stem&#xD;
      cells from the bone marrow microenvironment. Plerixafor is a bicyclam small molecule&#xD;
      inhibitor of CXCR4 and has been extensively studied by our group and others as a potent stem&#xD;
      cell mobilization agent both in combination with G-CSF or alone (25, 62). Plerixafor is&#xD;
      currently being investigated in a phase I/II trial in combination with salvage chemotherapy&#xD;
      for relapsed AML in an attempt to sensitize leukemia stem cells to chemotherapy. The goal of&#xD;
      this study is to determine the optimal dose of plerixafor for the treatment of patients with&#xD;
      high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in combination with G-CSF and azacitidine. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that plerixafor in combination with G-CSF will detach MDS blasts from the bone&#xD;
      marrow microenvironment resulting in their increased proliferation and sensitivity to&#xD;
      azacitidine; thus, improving complete and partial response rates (CR/PR).&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically confirmed MDS with 5-20% blasts on bone marrow&#xD;
             aspirate at the time of study enrollment AND at least one cytopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  MDS is defined by the WHO criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous therapy with decitabine or azacitidine will be allowed but patients must be&#xD;
             at least 4 weeks from prior chemotherapy or radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt;=18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the&#xD;
             use of plerixafor in combination with G-CSF or azacitidine in patients &lt;18 years of&#xD;
             age, children are excluded from this study; however, they will be eligible for future&#xD;
             pediatric phase II combination trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of greater than 2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status &lt;= 2 (Karnofsky &gt;=60%; see Appendix 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have normal organ function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AST ≤ 2.0 X institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  creatinine within normal institutional limits OR&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  creatinine clearance &gt;=60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels above&#xD;
             institutional normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability of the patient (or legally authorized representative, if applicable) to&#xD;
             understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females of child bearing potential must agree to abstain from sexual activity or to&#xD;
             use a medically approved contraceptive measure/regimen during and for 3 months after&#xD;
             the treatment period. Women of child bearing potential must have a negative serum or&#xD;
             urine pregnancy test at the time of enrollment. Acceptable methods of birth control&#xD;
             include oral contraceptive, intrauterine device (IUD), transdermal/implanted or&#xD;
             injected contraceptives and abstinence. Males must agree to abstain from sexual&#xD;
             activity or agree to utilize a medically approved contraception method during and for&#xD;
             3 months after the treatment period. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is&#xD;
             pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician&#xD;
             immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with untreated 5q minus syndrome MDS&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had G-CSF or GM-CSF within 2 weeks of the start of study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain metastases. (These patients should be excluded from this&#xD;
             clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop&#xD;
             progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic&#xD;
             and other adverse events.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions attributed to compounds of&#xD;
             similar chemical or biologic composition to plerixafor, azacitidine, G-CSF, or&#xD;
             mannitol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of sickle cell anemia. (G-CSF may initiate pain crises.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because plerixafor, G-CSF, and azacitidine&#xD;
             are agents with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there&#xD;
             is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with azacitidine, G-CSF, or plerixafor, breastfeeding should&#xD;
             be discontinued. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible&#xD;
             because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with plerixafor. In&#xD;
             addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with&#xD;
             marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients&#xD;
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with advanced malignant hepatic tumors&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of cardiac arrhythmia&#xD;
