  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine the safety of the combination of the two&#xD;
      drugs cediranib and temsirolimus and the highest doses of these two drugs that can be given&#xD;
      in combination to people safely. Cediranib is a drug that may stop blood supply to the tumor&#xD;
      and therefore help keep cancer cells from growing. Temsirolimus is a drug that may stop&#xD;
      cancer cells from growing. These drugs have been used in other research studies in ovarian&#xD;
      and kidney cancer and these studies suggest that these drugs may help to keep cancer from&#xD;
      growing in this research study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  We are looking for the highest dose of the study drugs that can be administered safely&#xD;
           without severe or unmanageable side effects in participants that have recurrent&#xD;
           gynecological cancers. Not everyone who participates in this research study will receive&#xD;
           the same dose of the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There will be samples of blood taken that measure any additional effect of the study&#xD;
           drugs and to look for a marker for the participant's particular type of cancer. Blood&#xD;
           will be taken at a certain point in the study to evaluate the interaction of the two&#xD;
           study drugs, cediranib and temsirolimus when given together. These are called&#xD;
           pharmacokinetic (PK) samples. About 6 teaspoons of blood will be taken with each PK&#xD;
           sample with a total of 34 samples taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be given a study medication diary for each treatment cycle. Each cycle&#xD;
           lasts four weeks (28 days). Temsirolimus will be given on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of each&#xD;
           cycle. Cediranib wil be taken orally once daily in the morning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be asked to monitor their blood pressure on a daily basis at home and&#xD;
           keep a blood pressure diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The following tests and procedures will be performed at specific time periods during the&#xD;
           course of the study: medical history; side effect assessment; physical exam; vital&#xD;
           signs; blood tests; CT scan; MUGA or ECHO; EKG and urine test.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Up to one prior line of chemotherapy in the recurrent setting is allowed. Biologic&#xD;
