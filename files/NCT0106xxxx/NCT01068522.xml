  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People who survive severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) live with profound cognitive&#xD;
      impairments that alter their developmental course and define their future possibilities.&#xD;
      Worldwide, TBI is the leading cause of death and disability among children and adolescents&#xD;
      (Murgio, 2000). In the United States, the annual incidence of TBI is six times greater than&#xD;
      that of multiple sclerosis, HIV/AIDS, spinal cord injury, and breast cancer combined [Centers&#xD;
      for Disease Control, American Cancer Society, National Multiple Sclerosis Society]. The&#xD;
      burden of TBI may be even greater in developing countries, due to civil unrest and war, and&#xD;
      to the absence of mandated prevention such as seat belt laws.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term objective of the investigators' research group is to improve outcomes for&#xD;
      survivors of TBI in Latin America. To that end, the investigators have created a structure&#xD;
      for professionals and institutions involved in the treatment of TBI to generate research; to&#xD;
      facilitate education, standardization, certification, the dissemination of information and&#xD;
      resources; and to foster the development of evidence-based guidelines. The structure is the&#xD;
      Latin American Brain Injury Consortium (LABIC).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this application is to establish a network of Centers of Excellence within&#xD;
      LABIC that will, in collaboration with U.S. partners, conduct research and training programs&#xD;
      about TBI. To that end, this project will include scientific investigation and capacity&#xD;
      building.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary focus for scientific investigation is to conduct a high quality randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial addressing a question of critical importance to the management of TBI&#xD;
      worldwide:&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ Does the use of information provided by intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring to direct&#xD;
      treatment of patients with TBI improve medical practice and patient outcomes in a developing&#xD;
      country? This trial will be conducted in three trauma centers in Bolivia, in which the&#xD;
      infrastructures and practice patterns are optimal for strong internal validity, while at the&#xD;
      same time the level of resources is representative of trauma care as practiced in the&#xD;
      developing world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary focus for scientific investigation is to conduct a prospective study of TBI in&#xD;
      seven trauma centers in Bolivia, Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, and Ecuador that represent the&#xD;
      variation in access to and use of resources in the developing world. This study will address&#xD;
      two questions of vital importance to management of TBI in developing countries:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To what extent do the findings from the randomized trial about ICP monitoring in&#xD;
           particular, and brain injury care in general, generalize to diverse populations of TBI&#xD;
           patients in Latin America?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What is the association between resources and outcomes from TBI in developing countries?&#xD;
           To build capacity, we will provide education, equipment, and structure, and will foster&#xD;
           the collaborations established during the pilot R21 phase of this project. Our&#xD;
           commitment is that LABIC becomes completely independent as a research entity. At the end&#xD;
           of the funding period LABIC constituents will be able to identify important research&#xD;
           questions, design the research, write successful proposals for funding, carry out strong&#xD;
           studies, analyze and interpret the data, submit successful publications to&#xD;
           internationally recognized peer reviewed journals, and disseminate information across&#xD;
           Latin America.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our specific aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim#1: In a randomized controlled trial in 3 trauma centers in Bolivia, test the&#xD;
      effect on outcomes of management of severe TBI guided by information from ICP monitors vs. a&#xD;
      standard empiric protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis #1: Patients with severe TBI whose acute care treatment is managed using ICP&#xD;
      monitors will have significantly lower mortality and better neuropsychological and functional&#xD;
      recovery at 6 months post-trauma than those whose treatment is managed with the standard&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis #2: The incorporation of ICP monitoring into the care of patients with severe TBI&#xD;
      will minimize secondary complications and decrease length of stay in intensive care unit&#xD;
      (ICU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #2: In a prospective, observational study conducted in trauma centers in Latin&#xD;
      America, test the association between resource availability/medical management and outcomes&#xD;
      for patients with severe TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis #3: The association between treatment and outcomes for patients with severe TBI&#xD;
      identified in the randomized trial of ICP monitoring will generalize to the population in the&#xD;
      prospective, observational, multi-center, multi-national study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis #4: Variations in resource availability and medical management will be&#xD;
      significantly associated with mortality and functional recovery for patients with severe TBI,&#xD;
      after controlling for patient and injury characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #3: Establish a network of research centers with investigators trained and&#xD;
      skilled in the design, conduct, and funding of research programs to address TBI and other&#xD;
      brain disorders in Latin America.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In fulfilling these aims, we will answer important research questions about patient&#xD;
      characteristics, treatment, and outcomes from TBI in an environment of limited resources,&#xD;
      aspects of which will generalize to other developing countries as well as to the developed&#xD;
      world. In a developing country, we will test the effectiveness of technology considered&#xD;
      pivotal to brain trauma treatment in the developed world - the ICP monitor. The outcome of&#xD;
      this trial may serve to standardize practice, improve outcomes, and mobilize resources&#xD;
      worldwide. A randomized controlled trial of ICP monitoring has never been performed. As&#xD;
      specifically stated in the Guidelines for the Management of Severe Brain Injury (Bullock et&#xD;
      al., 1996), this is a critical gap in the evidence base that supports the role of ICP&#xD;
      monitoring in TBI care. As such, the results of the RCT as performed in Bolivia will have&#xD;
      global implications regardless of the level of development of the trauma system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also establish sustainable capacity to conduct research about TBI in Latin America.&#xD;
      Within the structure of LABIC, we will create a cadre of professionals who are trained in&#xD;
      clinical research and equipped to carry out studies that answer questions important to Latin&#xD;
      America. These studies will establish a literature base from which Latin American treatment&#xD;
      guidelines will be generated. With training in cognitive assessment, we will introduce a new&#xD;
      discipline into many of the Latin American medical systems that will provide an understanding&#xD;
      of the unique and profound disabilities associated with brain disorders.&#xD;
