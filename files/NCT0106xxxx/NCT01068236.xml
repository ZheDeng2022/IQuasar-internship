      This project will examine the effectiveness of a primary care based intervention to help&#xD;
      overweight teen girls adopt healthy lifestyle practices. Participants are adolescent females&#xD;
      at select Kaiser Permanente Northwest primary care clinics with a body mass index above the&#xD;
      90th percentile. Teens will be randomly assigned to (1) a behavioral weight control program&#xD;
      (enriched intervention), (or 2) usual-care (control). Primary care providers of teens in the&#xD;
      intervention condition are given customized plans describing the teen's eating and physical&#xD;
      activity habits and instructions on how to best work with these teens and their families. The&#xD;
      behavioral weight control program is specifically tailored for teen girls and includes&#xD;
      separate group meetings for teens and parents, follow-up telephone contacts with their group&#xD;
      leader, and coordinated feedback from the teen's primary care provider.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is currently a major US public health problem, given its prevalence and adverse&#xD;
      health consequences. In the past two decades, the percentage of overweight adolescents has&#xD;
      almost tripled from 5 to 14%. Clinic-based weight control treatments for youth have&#xD;
      demonstrated some success, but most have been designed for pre-adolescent children and their&#xD;
      families. Even though considerable research explores adult-weight control and a growing body&#xD;
      of research examines childhood obesity, treatments for adolescents have not been adequately&#xD;
      studied. Also, almost all empirically tested interventions for youth have been based in&#xD;
      academic research clinics rather than in primary care medical settings, where weight problems&#xD;
      are most often identified and may be most efficiently treated. Placing adolescent&#xD;
      weight-related interventions in primary medical care settings could make them both more&#xD;
      easily disseminated and more cost-effective. Finally, treating obesity in a primary care&#xD;
      (non-school) setting may be particularly effective/appropriate for teen girls for two&#xD;
      reasons. First, overweight girls are at higher risk than normal-weight peers for engaging in&#xD;
      unhealthy weight-control behaviors. Second, researchers speculate that teen girls'&#xD;
      self-consciousness in mixed-gender physical education (PE) classes may contribute to their&#xD;
      lower enrollment rates enrollment in PE classes and overall decline in physical activity in&#xD;
      recent years. If so, targeting physical activity in a primary-care-based program may be more&#xD;
      successful than in school-based programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to examine the clinical effectiveness and incremental cost-effectiveness of a&#xD;
      primary care-based multi-component lifestyle intervention for overweight adolescent females&#xD;
      and their families. This multi-component intervention will be tailored for gender and&#xD;
      developmental stage, and will include a behaviorally-based intervention for teens and parents&#xD;
      as well as coordinated feedback and counseling from the adolescent's pediatric primary care&#xD;
      provider (PCP). We will compare the primary care-based intervention to a usual-care control&#xD;
      condition in which adolescents and their family receive information about weight loss and&#xD;
      guidelines for achieving and maintaining a healthy lifestyle along with the encouragement to&#xD;
      utilize any appropriate health care services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal aim of the study is to determine the clinical effectiveness of a primary&#xD;
      care-based, multi-component lifestyle intervention for overweight (â‰¥ 90th percentile)&#xD;
      adolescent females and their families. H1: We hypothesize that the treatment group will have&#xD;
      a greater decrease in BMI z-score from baseline to 12 months than the control youth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, we include the following secondary aims that are exploratory and intended to be&#xD;
      hypothesis-generating rather than hypothesis-testing activities:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine if dietary intake (total energy intake, % calories from fat, etc.) and/or physical&#xD;
      activity mediate the effect of the intervention on BMI z score. H2: Change in dietary intake&#xD;
      and physical activity from baseline to 6 months will mediate the relationship between the&#xD;
      intervention and change in BMI z score from baseline to 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine the impact of the experimental intervention for overweight adolescents and their&#xD;
      families on the secondary outcomes including other physiological parameters (triglycerides,&#xD;
      cholesterol, fasting insulin), quality of life, and psychosocial functioning; participant&#xD;
      safety (depression and disordered eating behaviors); and feasibility/acceptability of the&#xD;
      intervention (e.g., participant and provider satisfaction) in preparation for future Phase&#xD;
      III trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine the incremental cost-effectiveness of the intervention relative to usual care from&#xD;
      the societal perspective. We will examine the direct cost of delivering the intervention and&#xD;
      this treatment's impact on subsequent use and cost of health services. We also will include&#xD;
      indirect costs to participants and their families due to their participation in the&#xD;
      intervention and use of other health care services (e.g., time spent in travel, usual care&#xD;
      visits, out-of session activities).&#xD;
