    <textblock>
      Restoration of lost dentition in the severely atrophic posterior maxilla has for the last 2&#xD;
      decades been successfully treated with various sinus augmentation techniques and installation&#xD;
      of dental implants. The use of graft material is anticipated to be necessary; however, recent&#xD;
      studies have demonstrated that the mere lifting of the sinus mucosal lining and simultaneous&#xD;
      placement of implants result in bone formation. This study was conducted in order to evaluate&#xD;
      simultaneous sinus mucosal lining elevation and installation of dental implants without any&#xD;
      graft material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study describes and evaluates a modification of the surgical protocol for sinus&#xD;
      mucosal lining elevation and simultaneous installation of osseointegrated implants with a MIS&#xD;
      implant system (Seven â„¢) ,in 20 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative Examination: (Screening):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Medical History&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Clinical Examination&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Oral hygiene.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Oral mucosa condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Number of missing teeth in the posterior maxilla.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Radiographic Examination (CT and Panoramic X-ray)&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Sinus Maxillary condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Sub-antral bone height.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Bone jaw condition. Selected patients under the &quot;inclusion criteria&quot; will be&#xD;
                included in the study after they will have explanation and signed on informed&#xD;
                consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be operated on under local anesthesia (2% Xylocaine Dental with epinephrine&#xD;
      1:100,000;) or General anesthesia ( the type of the anesthesia will be decided by the&#xD;
      patients) at Carmel medical center Haifa.. Preoperative antibiotics will orally administered&#xD;
      45 minutes before surgery; patients routinely received 2 g of Augmentin or 600 mg of&#xD;
      clindamycin (when allergic to penicillin).and 6mg of Dexamethasone 1 hour before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical Technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The posterior maxillary edentulous area and the maxillary sinus wall will be exposed via a&#xD;
      crestal incision and a buccal muco-periosteal flap will be raised. Osteotomy in a oval or&#xD;
      rectangular fashion will be made with round Drill 5 mm radius in the anterior wall of the&#xD;
      sinus, 5 to 6 mm cranial to the intended implant site (Fig 1). With small sharp elevators the&#xD;
      cortical bony window will be pulled in the sinus cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perforations of various sizes of the sinus mucosal lining will be treated by drilling small&#xD;
      holes in the bone above the cortical window to elevate and suture the mucosal lining to that&#xD;
      level using absorbable sutures (Vicryl 6-0). If there is success in this technique we will&#xD;
      use a small piece of periosteum (taken from the buccal flap) which will be placed as a lid&#xD;
      over a perforation of the sinus mucosal lining. If the perforations are so small (less than 1&#xD;
      mm) then further dissection of the mucosal lining and &quot;tenting&quot; by the implants will be&#xD;
      considered satisfactory for a blood clot to form around the implants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the elevation, implants will be installed in the residual sub-antral bone. The&#xD;
      remaining bone height will be recorded with a depth gauge during surgery. Primary implant&#xD;
      stability will be noted manually at installation. A stabilizing wrench will be used when&#xD;
      removing the implant carrier in all cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve implant stability in the cases of small remaining levels of vertical subantral&#xD;
      bone, the protocol of installing the MIS system dental implant was modified in its last&#xD;
      preparation step. The final conical burr was leveled into the bone 1 to 2 mm less than the&#xD;
      recommended standard protocol in cases with only 2 to 3 mm residual bone. Thus, a slightly&#xD;
      smaller hole for the implant was prepared and the implant could be placed with better primary&#xD;
      stability, utilizing the effect of the conical design and the retention of the microthreads&#xD;
      in the superior part, adding an extra effect to the placement and thereby achieving&#xD;
      sufficient primary stability. The compartment around the implants under the sinus mucosal&#xD;
      lining in the sinus floor will be filled with blood from surrounding bleeding (Fig 2), and&#xD;
      dental membrane (Zimmer Ltd.) will be placed on the open window, then the incision will be&#xD;
      closed with resorbable sutures (Vicryl 3/0. Ethicon Inc&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative Care:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analgesics will be prescribed with Optalgin or with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug for&#xD;
      1 to 2 weeks following the surgery. Antibiotic treatment will be continue for 10 days&#xD;
      postoperatively with Augmentin 875mg Twice a day (or clindamycin, 300 mg 3 times daily for&#xD;
      penicillin allergic patients). Patients should be instructed not to blow their nose and to&#xD;
      use nasal spray saline for 14 days after surgery. Wearing dentures will not be allowed for 10&#xD;
      days following the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be reviewed and sutures taken out after 7 to 10 days. Clinical and Radiological&#xD;
      Follow-up The patient will be recalled to the out patient clinic in Carmel Medical Center,&#xD;
      for a follow up. All patients will be checked in the surgery site and x-ray radiograph will&#xD;
      be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiological follow up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periapical radiographs and Panoramic X-ray will be used for measurements of 1) the height of&#xD;
      the residual alveolar bone at each implant site, and 2) the height of newly formed bone in&#xD;
      the maxillary sinus in relation to each implant. Measurements will be made manually with a&#xD;
      millimeter scale. The cervical micro-threaded area of the implant will be used as a reference&#xD;
      point during measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for considering the procedure as successful:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Successful implants ( no pain, no infection, stable implants) at the uncovering&#xD;
           procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Periapical and panoramic x-ray at the endpoint shows a bone formation around the implant&#xD;
           inside the maxillary sinus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uncovering of the implant will be done 6 month after the surgery. All patients will be&#xD;
      operated on under local anesthesia (2% Xylocaine Dental with epinephrine 1:100,000;) the&#xD;
      implant instillation area and the maxillary sinus wall will be exposed via a crestal incision&#xD;
      and a buccal mucoperiosteal flap will be raised.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A healing cap will be inserted in the implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A punch of 2mm biopsy will be take from the maxillary wall. The incision will be closed&#xD;
           with resorbable sutures (Vicryl 3/0. Ethicon Inc) around the healing cap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The referring dentists will carried out the prosthetic rehabilitation after two weeks for the&#xD;
      uncovering procedure. All patients will be recalled for follow up after the prosthetic&#xD;
      rehabilitation 2 and 4 months in our out patients clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics Descriptive statistics will be used and the correlation of results will be&#xD;
      confirmed with linear regression analysis.&#xD;
