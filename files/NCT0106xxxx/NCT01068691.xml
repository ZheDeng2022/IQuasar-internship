    <textblock>
      A dissecting or intramural haematoma of the thoracic aorta (AH) is a haemorrhage that&#xD;
      dissects the aortic wall. An entry point is detected at an intimal tear, ulcer or plaque&#xD;
      rupture via imaging in almost 50% of cases. AH occurs in older patients than those with AD&#xD;
      and develops on atheromatous lesions with parietal ulcers, most often in cases of poorly&#xD;
      managed, pre-existing hypertension (HTN). Type A AHs, which affect the ascending aorta,&#xD;
      frequently progress towards an AD with a high risk of mortality, and represent a surgical&#xD;
      indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have presented AD or AH, whether they have been operated or not, must undergo&#xD;
      prolonged monitoring. This involves both clinical and radiological checks to ensure that&#xD;
      blood pressure is properly monitored, that the parietal lesions have receded and that there&#xD;
      are no complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HTN is a recognized risk factor for the onset of AD and systolic blood pressure must be&#xD;
      brought down to between 100 and 120 mmHg perioperatively. Furthermore, HTN is also a risk&#xD;
      factor for the rupture of unoperated type B AD. Despite this, only two studies have looked at&#xD;
      BP management in AD patients. The first, carried out among chronic type A or B AD patients&#xD;
      revealed that closer monitoring of blood pressure levels at home led to a better long-term&#xD;
      prognosis. Another study revealed a 60% prevalence of non-managed clinical HTN among 40&#xD;
      chronic AD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whilst frequent, regular aortic wall monitoring via imaging methods (CT or MRI) is&#xD;
      recommended after thoracic AD surgery, there is no precise recommendation as to the method of&#xD;
      BP monitoring in very high-risk patients. A BP level of 135/80 mmHg has been suggested as a&#xD;
      maximum limit for patients having been operated for AD. In order to achieve this,&#xD;
      antihypertensives of several therapeutic classes must be used, with beta-blockers as a&#xD;
      priority. The same can be said for AH, as it has been demonstrated that the absence of&#xD;
      beta-blocker treatment is a predictive factor for poor progress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increased aortic stiffness can cause increased systolic blood pressure and is recognized as&#xD;
      an independent cardiovascular risk factor. This stiffness can be detected by measuring the&#xD;
      carotid-to-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV). No study has as yet focused on assessing aortic&#xD;
      stiffness in patients who have undergone AD or AH surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) in thoracic AD patients is highly prevalent, and&#xD;
      respiratory events that occur are more severe. This has prompted some to suggest that&#xD;
      systematic detection of OSAS after AD should be carried out. No findings have yet been&#xD;
      published about patients who have undergone AH surgery.&#xD;

      Main objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the level of blood pressure control using ambulatory blood pressure&#xD;
           monitoring in patients who have undergone surgery for a type A thoracic AD or AH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study aortic stiffness within this patient population and determine its predictive&#xD;
           parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the prevalence of OSAS among this patient population and study the&#xD;
           relationship between respiratory data and blood pressure values.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the respective roles of blood pressure level, aortic stiffness, and&#xD;
           respiratory and biological parameters upon the postoperative aortic diameters of&#xD;
           patients who have undergone surgery for type A thoracic AD or AH.&#xD;
