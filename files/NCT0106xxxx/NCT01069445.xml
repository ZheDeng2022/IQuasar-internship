  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ageing of the population is a major event in the world. Gerontological/geriatric literature&#xD;
      unanimously indicate that physical exercise and diet are at present the two available&#xD;
      fundamental approaches to contrast/prevent most of the age associated alterations. In the&#xD;
      elderly the inflammageing, the oxidative stress and the alteration of the intestinal&#xD;
      microbiota can be influenced by nutritional status and possibly corrected by an appropriate&#xD;
      dietetic intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nowadays the nutraceutical food supplements become an opportunity for the consumer to improve&#xD;
      the quality of individual diet for specific needs This study will focus on the development of&#xD;
      a specific dietary approach through an E-Health dietary service, associated or not to&#xD;
      nutraceutical food supplements intake, to modulate the oxidative stress, inflammageing and&#xD;
      gut microflora in the elderly people.&#xD;
