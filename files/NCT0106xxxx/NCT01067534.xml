      Studies evaluating response to bronchodilation in flow-volume spirometry and/or by forced&#xD;
      oscillations technique (FOT), have been conduced in subjects with obstructive airways&#xD;
      diseases. Less is known about bronchodilation responses, assessed by both spirometry and FOT&#xD;
      in healthy young subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the present study is&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to determine the range of the bronchodilation response in terms of changes in selected&#xD;
           spirometric parameters in healthy non-smoking young adults, for identifying normal&#xD;
           response after an inhaled bronchodilatory agent versus placebo, and its anthropometric&#xD;
           and spirometric determinants&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to determine the range and characteristics of bronchodilation response using&#xD;
           pseudorandom FOT in healthy non-smoking young adults, for identifying normal response&#xD;
           after an inhaled bronchodilatory agent versus placebo, and its anthropometric and&#xD;
           oscillometric determinants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to compare and correlate eventual changes in spirometric and oscillometric parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that exists a normal variation in spirometric and oscillometric&#xD;
      parameters after bronchodilation, and that these parameters are correlated.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies evaluating response to bronchodilation in flow-volume spirometry and/or by forced&#xD;
      oscillations technique (FOT), have been conduced in subjects (children or adults) with&#xD;
      obstructive airways diseases. Less is known about bronchodilation responses, assessed by both&#xD;
      spirometry and FOT in healthy young subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the present study is&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to determine the range of the bronchodilation response in terms of changes in PEF, FEV1,&#xD;
           FEF25, FEF50, FEF75, and FEF25-75, in healthy non-smoking young adults, for identifying&#xD;
           normal response after an inhaled bronchodilatory agent versus placebo, and its&#xD;
           anthropometric and spirometric determinants&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to determine the range and characteristics of bronchodilation response using&#xD;
           pseudorandom FOT in healthy non-smoking young adults, for identifying normal response&#xD;
           after an inhaled bronchodilatory agent versus placebo, and its anthropometric and&#xD;
           oscillometric determinants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to compare and correlate eventual changes in spirometric and oscillometric parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIAL AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conduced in the Laboratory of Respiratory Functions of the University&#xD;
      Hospital of Patras, Patras, Greece.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy, non-smoking young adults (medical students and residents) will be voluntary&#xD;
      included. Participants will be assessed for eligibility with a structured interview which&#xD;
      include questions regarding respiratory symptoms (wheezing, attacks off shortness of breath,&#xD;
      sputum production, and dyspnea at rest or on exertion), diagnosed respiratory diseases, and&#xD;
      use of pulmonary medication. A subject will be considered as non-smoker if he/she has never&#xD;
      smoked or has discontinued smoking at least 5 years prior to entering the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric data will be obtained at the enrollment. All oscillometric and spirometric&#xD;
      measurements will be performed during morning hours (09:00 to 12:00). Subjects will be&#xD;
      advised to refrain from consuming coffee or tea, and engaging in heavy eating for 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respiratory impedance spectra (Zrs), yielding resistance (Rrs) and reactance (Xrs) as a&#xD;
      function of frequency, will be obtained using a commercially available device (i2m, Chess&#xD;
      Medical, Belgium), in accordance with the ERS 2003 guidelines. The forced oscillatory signal&#xD;
      is a pseudorandom signal consisting of frequency components between 4 and 48 Hz with a&#xD;
      measurement period of 8 sec. During measurement the subject will be seated comfortably&#xD;
      upright with the neck in the neutral position and the arms resting comfortably by the side.&#xD;
      The cheeks and lower jaw of the subject will be firmly supported by a staff member during all&#xD;
      measurements. Participants will be connected to the device via a mouthpiece incorporating a&#xD;
      bacterial filter and instructed to breathe normally with a nose clip in place. Five&#xD;
      technically acceptable measurements will be obtained. A measurement will be considered&#xD;
      unacceptable if coherence will be &lt;0.95 at 2 or more frequencies or if Zrs show obvious&#xD;
      artifacts. The calibration of the device will be checked daily with a known resistance. All&#xD;
      measurements will be performed by the same trained respiratory physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spirometric measurements will always follow FOT measurements. Spirometry will be completed&#xD;
      with a flow-volume device (MasterScreen IOS, Viasys/Jaeger; Höchberg, Germany), with the&#xD;
      subject seated, using ATS 1994 criteria for performing the maneuver. Nose clips and&#xD;
      disposable bacterial filters will be used. At least three technically acceptable measurements&#xD;
      will be recorded with a maximum of eight efforts. All measurements will be performed by the&#xD;
      same trained respiratory physician. The calibration of the device will be checked daily with&#xD;
      a 3-L calibration syringe (Viasys/Jaeger; Höchberg, Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will inhale 0.4mg of salbutamol (Aerolin, GlaxoSmithCline, London, UK) through a&#xD;
      spacer device (Volumatic, GlaxoSmithCline), or a placebo inhaler (Allen &amp; Hanburys LTD,&#xD;
      Greenford, UK) again through a similar spacer. Special measures will be taken to ensure the&#xD;
      blindness of the participants regarding the received inhaler.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respiratory function measurements (FOT followed by spirometry) will be repeated (as described&#xD;
      above) 15 min after the inhalation. Subjects will remain seated without consuming beverages&#xD;
      other than water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will have two sessions of baseline and post-inhalation measurements; one after&#xD;
      receiving salbutamol and one after placebo. These sessions will be performed one day apart.&#xD;
      The respiratory physician who will perform the measurements will be unaware regarding the&#xD;
      received inhaler.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All technically acceptable Zrs measurements will be averaged and mean Rrs and Xrs at 4, 6, 8,&#xD;
      10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, and 48 Hz will be&#xD;
      calculated. The resonance frequency, the average Rrs between 4-24 Hz (Rrs 4-24) and 4-48 Hz&#xD;
      (Rrs 4-48), and the frequency dependence of Rrs 4-24 and Rrs 4-48 will be also assessed.&#xD;
      Absolute and relative changes after bronchodilation or placebo will be examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spirometric variables which will used in analysis will include PEF, FEV1, FEF25, FEF50,&#xD;
      FEF75, and FEF25-75. Absolute and relative changes after bronchodilation or placebo will be&#xD;
      examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple linear regression analysis will be performed to determine the individual effects of&#xD;
      the following factors on absolute and relative bronchodilatory responses: age, sex, height,&#xD;
      weight, BMI, and baseline lung function. The Pearson correlation will be used to assess the&#xD;
      association of oscillometric and spirometric variables. All analyses will be performed using&#xD;
      SPSS 17 for windows (SPSS, Chicago, IL).&#xD;
