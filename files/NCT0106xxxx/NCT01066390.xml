      This phase I study plan is divided in the following four phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eligibility Screen Phase (week -4 to -1): Following written informed consent patients&#xD;
           with metastatic melanoma (AJCC stage III/IV with unresectable disease) will undergo an&#xD;
           eligibility screen (incl. blood analysis and PET/CT-scan).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TriMix-DC Vaccine Manufacturing Phase (week I to IV): eligible patients will undergo a&#xD;
           leucapheresis (15 liter of venous blood) for the preparation of autologous TriMix-DC&#xD;
           vaccine. Vaccine preparations will be manufactured and quality-controlled (during an&#xD;
           interval of 4 weeks following the leucapheresis) and released for patient administration&#xD;
           if the TriMix-DC preparation fulfills the predefined quality requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TriMix-DC Vaccine Administration Phase (Week 1 to 24): 4 weeks after the leucapheresis&#xD;
           patients will initiate therapeutic vaccination with the TriMix-DC vaccine by IV and ID&#xD;
           administration. The vaccines will be administered at 4 different visits that will be&#xD;
           separated with an interval of 2 weeks. At each vaccination a total of 12.106 DC per&#xD;
           antigen will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be allocated to three different cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The first cohort will receive 10% of TriMix-DC by iv and 90% by id injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The second cohort 25% by iv and 75% by id injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The third cohort 50% by iv and 50% by id injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the week following the administration of the fourth vaccine (= week 8), a&#xD;
           DTH-test and punch biopsy of the injection site will be performed as well as a second&#xD;
           leucapheresis (for the purpose of immuno-monitoring) and tumor evaluation (by PET-CT).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A fifth vaccine will be administered and a repeat tumor staging performed in week 16 (=&#xD;
           8w after the fourth vaccine).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  End of study visit: Patients will perform an &quot;end of study visit&quot; 8 weeks after the&#xD;
           fifth vaccine (= week 24) as well as a new tumor evaluation (PET/CT).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up Phase: survival data will be obtained until 3 years after the initiation of&#xD;
           vaccine therapy or the time of death.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;

          1. Able and willing to give valid written informed consent before undergoing any&#xD;
             study-related activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with histological documentation of AJCC stage III or IV melanoma of the skin,&#xD;
             mucosa, eye or unknown primary.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Unable to undergo resection of all metastatic disease.&#xD;
