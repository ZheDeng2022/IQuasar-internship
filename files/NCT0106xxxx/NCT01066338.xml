  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The most reliable prognostic marker of acute myeloid leukemia(AML) is cytogenetics by&#xD;
      karyotyping. According to cytogenetic results, the patients with AML are classified as&#xD;
      better, intermediate and poor prognosis groups. The normal karyotype AML was reported in&#xD;
      about 50% of all AML and classified as intermediate risk group. However, the patients with&#xD;
      normal karyotype AML showed various prognosis. Therefore, the further studies about subgroup&#xD;
      analysis of normal karyotype AML are needed. Recently, the understandings of human genome&#xD;
      polypmorphism using SNP array have been accumulated. However, the advanced researches for&#xD;
      clinical application are not enough.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is a retrospective and single-center study. The patients with normal&#xD;
      karyotyping AML who were diagnosed from 1994 to 2008 at Samsung Medical Center (South Korea)&#xD;
      will be enrolled. The stored bone marrow samples of enrolled patients are used for genome&#xD;
      wide scanning by SNP array.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of present study is to develop predictive pharmacogenemic biomarkers model&#xD;
      associated wit clinical outcomes including efficacy and toxicity in patients with AML with&#xD;
      normal karyotype treated with chemotherapy using pharmacogenetic SNP array. And secondly, to&#xD;
      develop enrichment clinical trial based on predictive pharmacogenomic model.&#xD;
