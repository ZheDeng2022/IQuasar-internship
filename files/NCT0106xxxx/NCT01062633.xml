      This study aims at demonstrating the effect of erythritol and xylitol lozenges on preventing&#xD;
      the new caries lesions and the possible remineralization effect of both polyols on incipient&#xD;
      caries lesions.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Several polyols (xylitol, sorbitol, erythritol) have been shown to act as&#xD;
      excellent sugar substitutes, especially for in-between meals food products. Most commonly&#xD;
      they are used in chewing gums, but the recent field trials also show a clear effectiveness of&#xD;
      xylitol lozenges. Although sorbitol is metabolized at a slower rate than sucrose and not at&#xD;
      all by most microorganisms, it can be fermented at a slow rate by all of the mutans&#xD;
      streptococci including S. mutans while xylitol and erythritol are considered to be&#xD;
      non-acidogenic. It has been demonstrated in some studies that xylitol reduces to a greater&#xD;
      extent caries rate than sorbitol, however, the scientific committee on medicinal products is&#xD;
      of the opinion that no clear data support the concept that xylitol possesses specific effects&#xD;
      in vivo which validate a superiority claim over other polyols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: It is believed that the benefits of sugar-free gums may be twofold; 1) decreased&#xD;
      lactic acid production and increased salivary flow potentially leading to an increased&#xD;
      buffering of acids in plaque and 2) increased supersaturation of saliva with the mineral ions&#xD;
      as well as enhanced clearance of sugars from the mouth. Thus sugar substitution and salivary&#xD;
      stimulation could, it has been argued, be equally responsible for the noncariogenicity of&#xD;
      sugar-free chewing gum. By comparing long term effects of several polyols, on possible&#xD;
      remineralization effect on incipient caries lesions and on preventing the new caries lesions&#xD;
      in comparison with sorbitol,the study will help demonstrate the superiority of erythritol and&#xD;
      eventually xylitol over sorbitol and will help demonstrate the role of sugar substitutes,&#xD;
      beyond saliva stimulation-mediated oral benefits on dental caries prevention.Sorbitol&#xD;
      lozenges are used as a positive control. The saliva and plaque sample analyses would reveal&#xD;
      the possible mechanisms of the expected caries preventive effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This is a double-blind, parallel, randomized, controlled study in primary&#xD;
      school children around Tartu city. The allocation of the children into three groups will be&#xD;
      based on classrooms for the practical reasons. The classrooms will be randomly allocated into&#xD;
      the intervention and control groups. The study will last three years. During the first 2&#xD;
      years, the two intervention groups will consume either xylitol or erythritol-containing&#xD;
      lozenges and the control group will be provided with sorbitol-containing tablets Then, there&#xD;
      will be two options, depending on the effects on caries prevention after 2 years feeding with&#xD;
      the polyols and depending on the SD of the caries incidence,. If the SD &gt;2, the groups will&#xD;
      not be spilt up as the power of the study would not be high enough to see any statistical&#xD;
      effect. In this case, during the third experimental year, groups will stop eating&#xD;
      polyol-containing lozenges and tablets to assess the lasting preventive effects of the&#xD;
      polyol. If the SD&lt;2 , the groups will be spilt up into two sub-groups, where one sub-group&#xD;
      will stop eating polyols-containing lozenges to assess the lasting effect of polyol on caries&#xD;
      prevention and the other sub-group will continue consuming the polyol-containing lozenges to&#xD;
      assess the long-term effect of polyol intake on caries prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: The classrooms of 1st and 2nd primary schoolchildren (n=450) will be&#xD;
      randomly allocated into two intervention groups (erythritol and xylitol) and into one&#xD;
      positive control group (sorbitol. The list of the 1st and 2nd graders classrooms will be used&#xD;
      as a sample frame. The allocation of the classrooms will be based on the random numbers&#xD;
      generated by a computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: The test products will be distributed to the pupils in all (erythritol,&#xD;
      xylitol, and sorbitol) groups three times a day during the school days (about 200/year) by&#xD;
      the teachers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: All children will be clinically examined at the beginning of&#xD;
      the trial, one -, two - and three years after the baseline examinations. All the surfaces of&#xD;
      the mixed dentition (primary and permanent teeth) will be examined. The mean annual incipient&#xD;
      and dentinal caries increment will be calculated. The teeth (FT) and surfaces (FS) restored&#xD;
      or extracted because of caries during the study period will be calculated and included in the&#xD;
      caries experience indices (dmft/DMFT). The plaque and saliva samples will be collected in&#xD;
      each examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: There will be clinical examinations and plaque sample collection of the study&#xD;
      subjects four times in this study. Each examination will take about 15 min. No risks for the&#xD;
      pupils can be expected from these examinations. The children will be given a toothbrush and&#xD;
      toothpaste every 6 months. After the study examinations, pupils will be driven to a museum by&#xD;
      bus.&#xD;
