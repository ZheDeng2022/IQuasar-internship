  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Solving a problem in ambulatory setting may contain peripheral stress due to socio-evaluative&#xD;
      stressors (patient's expectations about explanations) and task contingent stress due to time&#xD;
      pressure, the necessity to take into account patient's mood, to deal with uncertainty of&#xD;
      their own data collection and with complex clinical situations. In France, excepted for&#xD;
      family medicine, undergraduate medical students and residents are currently not trained to&#xD;
      perform consultations and are never exposed to ambulatory patients during training. The&#xD;
      investigators postulate that this lack of practice may generate a significant state of stress&#xD;
      during the first consultations and consequently modify or even impair clinical reasoning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to compare subjective and physiological levels of&#xD;
      acute stress in ambulatory versus hospitalization setting in medical students confronted to a&#xD;
      real patient with a diagnostic problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures: The French version of the Anxiety Spielberger test is administered just before and&#xD;
      after each problem solving session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cortisol salivary samples are taken before and after each problem solving session. Salivary&#xD;
      cortisol levels have been shown to be correlated to stressful situations and some personality&#xD;
      traits but with some difference according to gender.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive appraisal (threat/challenge) is assessed before and after the tasks by the ratio of&#xD;
      primary appraisal to secondary appraisal according to Tomaka et al.&#xD;

      Participants and Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Year 6 medical students who attend a one-month full-time course in an Internal Medicine&#xD;
      Department are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since no consultations in the ambulatory setting are currently structured for medical&#xD;
      students, the following adjustments have been done within the internal medicine consultation&#xD;
      department, with the approval of the department director:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the consultation duration has been increased (1 hour instead of 30 minutes)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  during the first 30 minutes, consultation is performed by the participant&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  during the following 30 minutes, the patient is examined by his/her own physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The consent of the patient has been obtained by phone (prior to the consultation).&#xD;
