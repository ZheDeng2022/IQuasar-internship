    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is look at the effects of different types of exercise training with&#xD;
      a stretching group and its effect on lung cancer patients. Subjects will take part in a 16&#xD;
      week training intervention that can consist of aerobic, resistance, aerobic &amp; resistance, or&#xD;
      a control group. Pre and Post testing will include stress tests, echos, blood, and urine&#xD;
      samples.&#xD;

    <description>A customized and supervised endurance exercise training program that will last 4 months (16 weeks). The regimen will be tailored to the individual fitness level. The exercise program will consist of three supervised sessions per week. During each session, the participant will cycle on a stationary bicycle at moderate intensity for approximately 30-60 minutes.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>A customized and supervised resistance exercise training program that will last 4 months (16 weeks). Resistance training will be performed on stationary weight machines, modification in equipment may be made by Exercise Physiologist. Patients will be progressively trained to perform two to three sets of 75-85% of maximal strength The participant will be trained to perform different resistance exercise, alternating between lower and upper body muscle groups. The exercise program will consist of three supervised sessions per week. Each session will last approximately 30-60 minutes.</description>

    <description>A customized and supervised endurance exercise training program that will last 4 months (16 weeks). The regimen will be tailored to the individual fitness level, and will be a combination of Arm A and Arm B, described above. At each session, the participant will complete aerobic training on a stationary bicycle and also resistance training using stationary weight machines. The exercise program will consist of three supervised sessions per week. Each session will last approximately 30-90 minutes.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>A customized and supervised progressive stretching program that will last 4 months (16 weeks). The progressive stretching program will consist of a series of stretching exercises alternating between lower and upper body muscle groups/joints. This program will consist of three exercise sessions a week. Each session will last approximately 30-60 minutes.</description>

    <description>The overall goal for all the exercise training groups will be 3 supervised exercise sessions per week an intensity between 50 to 100% of the individually determined VO2peak for aerobic training and an intensity between 50% to 85% of 1-RM for resistance training. All the exercise interventions are designed such that participants begin exercising at a low intensity (~50%-60% VO2peak / 1RM) that is subsequently increased to more moderate to vigorous intensity (~70%-100% VO2peak / ~70-85% 1RM) when appropriate. All interventions will be individually tailored to each patient following the principles of aerobic or resistance training prescription guidelines for adults.</description>

    <description>The ultimate goal for the progressive stretching program is 3 individual stretching sessions. All sessions are required to be supervised. Duration of the stretching sessions is prescribed and implemented in accordance with standard stretching and flexibility training principles. This approach will be applied to guide each participant's prescribed stretching plan, with dose and scheduling modifications made by exercise physiologists, as required.</description>
