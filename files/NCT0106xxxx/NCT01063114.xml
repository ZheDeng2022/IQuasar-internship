  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are two types of external radiation treatments (proton beam and photon beam). As part&#xD;
      of the participant's treatment, they will receive radiation to the entire central nervous&#xD;
      system (CNS); this is known as craniospinal irradiation (CSI). In the past, photon radiation&#xD;
      therapy has been used for CSI. In this study we will be examining the effects of proton beam&#xD;
      radiation therapy. Studies have suggested that this kind of radiation can cause less damage&#xD;
      to normal tissue than photon radiation therapy. The physical characteristics of proton beam&#xD;
      radiation let the doctor safely deliver the amount of radiation delivered to the tumor that&#xD;
      is normally delivered through standard therapy but spare more normal tissue in the process.&#xD;

      -  Before beginning radiation therapy, participants will have scans done in order to&#xD;
           prepare for the radiation treatment. Doctors will use information gathered from these&#xD;
           scans to plan the best way to deliver radiation to the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The following procedures will be performed either before or during the radiotherapy:&#xD;
           Hearing exam; neurocognitive exam; blood tests and cerebral spinal fluid test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Not everyone who participates in this study will receive the same amount of proton&#xD;
           radiation therapy. The length of time and amount of radiation received will depend upon&#xD;
           the condition of the participant's disease. Radiation treatment will be given once a&#xD;
           day, 5 days a week (Monday-Friday). The overall treatment course will be approximately 6&#xD;
           weeks.&#xD;
