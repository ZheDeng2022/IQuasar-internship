      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Mitral regurgitation, or leaking of the mitral heart valve, is usually studied and assessed&#xD;
      with an ultrasound test called a two-dimensional (2D) echocardiogram. While this test has&#xD;
      proved very useful, technological improvements have helped researchers develop ways to study&#xD;
      the heart valves using imaging with three-dimensional (3D) capabilities. In addition,&#xD;
      recently developed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques may be able to provide better&#xD;
      information about the causes and severity of the leak. Researchers are interested in testing&#xD;
      these new techniques to determine their usefulness for patients with mitral regurgitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To evaluate newer methods of studying mitral regurgitation severity using real-time 3D&#xD;
      echocardiography (RT3DE) and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 21 years of age who have been diagnosed with more than mild mitral&#xD;
      regurgitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have two procedures as part of this study: an echocardiogram and an&#xD;
           MRI scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For the echocardiogram, participants will have an ultrasound scan with a special kind of&#xD;
           probe. Participants may also receive an injection of a contrast agent to provide a&#xD;
           better image of the heart on the scan. The scan will take approximately 1 hour to&#xD;
           complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For the MRI scan, participants will have a standard MRI with special pads placed on the&#xD;
           chest to provide better imaging of the heart. The scan will usually take between 45 and&#xD;
           90 minutes to complete.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Echocardiography is currently the technique of choice to assess the etiology and severity of&#xD;
      mitral regurgitation (MR). Multiple 2D and Doppler parameters are assessed in an integrated&#xD;
      fashion and the proximal flow convergent zone of the mitral regurgitation jet is used to&#xD;
      calculate effective regurgitant orifice area and regurgitant volume. These measurements have&#xD;
      been shown to have important prognostic information. In the last two years, the development&#xD;
      of transesophageal imaging with 3D capability has allowed a better visualization of mitral&#xD;
      leaflet pathology. Color Doppler 3D studies have shown that 2D methods generally&#xD;
      underestimate mitral regurgitant volume. Magnetic resonance techniques have recently been&#xD;
      developed to quantitate flow and calculate regurgitant volumes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate newer methods of quantitating mitral regurgitation&#xD;
      severity using real-time 3D echocardiography (RT3DE) and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (CMR). Although RT3DE measurements have been shown to correlate well with CMR measures of LV&#xD;
      volumes, using a 3D volumetric method to calculate mitral regurgitant volumes has not been&#xD;
      well studied. In patients with more than mild mitral regurgitation, we will obtain&#xD;
      transthoracic RT3DE measures of mitral regurgitant volume and compare them with traditional&#xD;
      2D measures of MR severity. We will also compare RT3DE and CMR measures of mitral regurgitant&#xD;
      volume.&#xD;
