      To determine single-dose oral bioequivalence of Minocycline HCl Extended Release Tablets 135&#xD;
      mg manufactured by Amneal Pharmaceuticals Co.(I)Pvt. Ltd., India and SOLODYN® (minocycline&#xD;
      hydrochloride) Extended Release Tablets 135 mg Manufactured for Medicis, The Dermatology&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Subjects will be fasted for at least 10 hours prior to scheduled time for dosing. As per the&#xD;
      randomization schedule, one tablet of test or reference product will be administered to each&#xD;
      subject with 240 mL of water at ambient temperature in each period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty four samples will be collected from each subject during each period. The venous blood&#xD;
      samples (5 mL each) will be withdrawn at pre-dose (before dosing, in the morning of the day&#xD;
      of dosing) and at 1.00, 2.00, 2.50, 3.00, 3.25, 3.50, 3.75, 4.00, 4.25, 4.50, 5.00, 5.50,&#xD;
      6.00, 7.00, 8.00, 10.00, 12.00, 16.00, 24.00, 48.00, 72.00, 96.00, and 120.00 hours after&#xD;
      dosing. The samples collected at 48.00, 72.00, 96.00, and 120.00 hours after dosing will be&#xD;
      on an ambulatory basis (i.e. on separate visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After collecting the blood samples from all the subjects at each sampling time point, samples&#xD;
      will be centrifuged under refrigeration with machine set at 3000 rpm, 10 minutes and 4oC.&#xD;
      After centrifugation, the plasma samples will be separated and transferred into respective&#xD;
      prelabeled polypropylene tubes. These polypropylene tubes will be stored below -20°C for a&#xD;
      maximum period of 12 hours and then they will be stored at -70°C ± 20°C until withdrawn for&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples from all the subjects completing both periods of the study as per the approved&#xD;
      protocol will be analyzed.&#xD;
