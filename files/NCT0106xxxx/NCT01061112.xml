      This research study will help determine how a person's genetic makeup affects their responses&#xD;
      to drugs, the ability of the body to break down drugs, and their potential to experience an&#xD;
      interaction between drugs. We are investigating the drug interactions between an antifungal&#xD;
      drug called fluconazole and the commonly used drugs tolbutamide, flurbiprofen, and&#xD;
      ketoprofen. Tolbutamide is used for management of Type 2 diabetes. Both flurbiprofen and&#xD;
      ketoprofen are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) often used for arthritis or&#xD;
      pain. We are interested in studying whether individuals with certain genetic profiles have&#xD;
      different drug interactions than normal. This research is being done to see if certain&#xD;
      genetic profiles require us to adjust medication doses differently than is needed for the&#xD;
      general population. Genetic profiles of subjects are determined from their previous&#xD;
      participation in the Pharmacogenetics Registry (Investigator Richard Brundage, University of&#xD;
      Minnesota).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is: Fraction metabolized by CYP2C9 enzyme determines the extent of drug&#xD;
      interactions in CYP2C9*1/*1 individuals but this factor (fraction metabolized) becomes less&#xD;
      influential and drug interactions are attenuated in a gene-dose dependent manner in&#xD;
      individuals with one or more defective alleles.&#xD;

      The study hypothesis is: Fraction metabolized by CYP2C9 enzyme determines the extent of drug&#xD;
      interactions in CYP2C9*1/*1 individuals but this factor (fraction metabolized) becomes less&#xD;
      influential and drug interactions are attenuated in a gene-dose dependent manner in&#xD;
      individuals with one or more defective alleles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: Examine the extent of fluconazole inhibition of drugs with varying degrees of&#xD;
      fraction metabolized by CYP2C9 in individuals with the CYP2C9*1/*1, CYP2C9*1/*3 and&#xD;
      CYP2C9*3/*3 genotypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People differ in their genetic makeup. This includes differences in genes involved in drug&#xD;
      metabolism, transport, and effect in the body. People with certain genetic profiles produce&#xD;
      altered enzymes, transporters, and receptors that may respond in different ways to drugs.&#xD;
      Altered enzymes cause some drugs to be broken down at a different rate than normal. As a&#xD;
      result, drug concentrations build up in the blood, and increase the risk of side effects.&#xD;
      Furthermore, when two drugs are taken together, the possibility exists for the drugs to&#xD;
      interact, with one drug causing a change in the metabolism of the other or both of the drugs.&#xD;
      It is not known whether people with an altered genetic makeup also have an altered experience&#xD;
      with drug interactions. Altered drug transporters can affect the absorption and elimination&#xD;
      of drugs as compared to normal causing differences in how long the drug stays in the body.&#xD;
      Finally, altered drug receptors can respond differently to drugs and, thus, produce altered&#xD;
      desired or undesired effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we will be investigating the drug interactions between an antifungal drug&#xD;
      called fluconazole and the commonly used drugs tolbutamide, flurbiprofen, and ketoprofen in&#xD;
      subjects with three different genotypes of the CYP2C9 enzyme. Tolbutamide is used for&#xD;
      management of Type 2 diabetes. Both flurbiprofen and ketoprofen are non-steroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) often used for arthritis or pain. We are interested in&#xD;
      studying whether individuals with certain genetic profiles have different drug interactions&#xD;
      than normal. This research is being done to see if certain genetic profiles require us to&#xD;
      adjust medication doses differently than is needed for the general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cytochrome P450 (CYP) superfamily of enzymes plays an important role in the oxidative&#xD;
      conversion of numerous xenobiotics into their more hydrophilic metabolites. CYP2C9, is an&#xD;
      important member of the CYP superfamily, accounting for 10-20% of the CYP protein content in&#xD;
      human liver and catalyzes approximately 20% of the CYP mediated drug oxidation reactions,&#xD;
      including tolbutamide and the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as&#xD;
      ketoprofen and flurbiprofen. It is now well established that genetic factors play an&#xD;
      important role in the control of CYP2C9 expression and activity. In particular, the *3 allele&#xD;
      is expressed at an allele frequency of 15%. Homozygotic *3 individuals exhibit significantly&#xD;
      reduced oral clearance for several CYP2C9 substrates. In most of these cases, the reduction&#xD;
      in clearance approaches 80% and even in heterozygotic individuals, this reduction in&#xD;
      clearance is 40-50% due to the co-dominant expression of CYP2C9. This reduction in clearance&#xD;
      has been associated with an increased frequency of adverse events following warfarin or&#xD;
      phenytoin administration, two clinically important drugs that exhibit a narrow therapeutic&#xD;
      index. The therapeutic index is a comparison of the amount of a therapeutic agent that causes&#xD;
      the therapeutic effect to the amount that causes toxic effects.&#xD;
