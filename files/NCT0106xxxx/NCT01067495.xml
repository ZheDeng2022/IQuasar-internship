  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the similarities between heart disease and stroke in terms of disease process and&#xD;
      elevated risk of recurrent events, exercise-based programs akin to cardiac rehabilitation are&#xD;
      not available for people with stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to examine 1) the feasibility of adapting cardiac rehabilitation&#xD;
      for individuals with stroke, and 2) the effects of this program on aerobic capacity, walking,&#xD;
      risk factors, community integration and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators anticipate that cardiac rehabilitation may be appropriately adapted to&#xD;
      accommodate individuals with stroke who have a range of functional abilities, and that this&#xD;
      program is effective in improving aerobic capacity, walking ability and stroke risk factors.&#xD;
      The investigators also anticipate participants will demonstrate improved community&#xD;
      integration and quality of life following this program.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are many parallels between heart disease in stroke, including their cardiovascular&#xD;
      etiologies, presence of co-morbidities and similarities in risk factors. Cardiac&#xD;
      rehabilitation is a well-established and successful model of care for individuals with heart&#xD;
      disease that is focused on exercise and risk factor modification. Yet analogous secondary&#xD;
      prevention programs for the stroke program are not readily available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main research question is: What is the feasibility and effect of cardiac rehabilitation&#xD;
      in individuals following stroke?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine if stroke survivors are able and willing to participate in a cardiac&#xD;
           rehabilitation program. Specifically, to determine the feasibility of the cardiac&#xD;
           rehabilitation program in individuals following stroke as determined by compliance to&#xD;
           attendance and training requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine if a cardiac rehabilitation program will have a meaningful benefit, among&#xD;
           chronic stroke survivors, on:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  walking capacity and ability: considering functional capacity [endurance /&#xD;
                distance] and quality [neuromotor control],&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  community integration: considering quantity [activity monitors] and quality [index&#xD;
                of reintegration to normal living] of activity&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  health-related quality of life: as determined by stroke specific index&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  risk factors for subsequent stroke: including exercise capacity, blood pressure,&#xD;
                blood lipid profile&#xD;
