    <textblock>
      Studies have established that the somatosensory system of the upper cervical region and head&#xD;
      can be intimately involved in tinnitus. Tinnitus can arise directly from a disorder of the&#xD;
      head and upper neck via the somatosensory system. Our clinical experience and review of&#xD;
      reports of various types of treatments support the hypothesis that treatment modalities&#xD;
      involving the somatosensory system can benefit individuals whose tinnitus is likely on a&#xD;
      somatosensory basis, namely people with symmetric hearing thresholds but asymmetric widely&#xD;
      fluctuating tinnitus. However these previous studies did not (a) limit their treatment&#xD;
      population to only people with tinnitus on a somatosensory basis and (b) did not assess their&#xD;
      results by considering this tinnitus subpopulation separately from the entire group of&#xD;
      tinnitus subjects they treated. Hence, the purpose of this study is to re-assess these&#xD;
      treatments by targeting people whose audiograms can not account for their tinnitus, such as&#xD;
      individuals with symmetric hearing thresholds but asymmetric widely fluctuating tinnitus&#xD;

      Until recently our attempts over the years at treatment of patients with such types of&#xD;
      tinnitus has met with little or no success. These treatments have included cervical physical&#xD;
      therapy and dental treatments for bruxism. A few with such tinnitus responded have had some&#xD;
      benefit from acupuncture applied to their periauricular region. A small formal trial with a&#xD;
      few patients did not provide any relief.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However a literature review (Levine et al., 2007) found a consistent line of evidence for a&#xD;
      tinnitus subgroup responsive to somatosensory based treatment modalities, including&#xD;
      electrical stimulation in the periauricular region, and acupuncture. Furthermore an&#xD;
      electrical stimulation device of the auricle P-Stim was found to be more effective than&#xD;
      standard acupuncture for a variety of conditions, including chronic cervical and low back&#xD;
      pain. For this convergence of reasons we have initiated an open trial with P-Stim over the&#xD;
      past 11 months. In a sense we have used it in an &quot;off-label&quot; capacity; just as many&#xD;
      medications have been found to be useful for conditions for which the medications were not&#xD;
      developed (see Levine 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The P-Stim is a battery-powered, transcutaneous electrical stimulator that delivers 1 per&#xD;
      second bipolar 1 millisecond pulses to three points on the auricle. The device connects via&#xD;
      three fine insulated stainless steel wires to three needles (each 0.4 mm diameter, 2 mm long)&#xD;
      that have been applied to three different points on the auricle. The device is powered by&#xD;
      three zinc air batteries, each with a voltage of 1.4 V. The device is on for 180 minutes,&#xD;
      then off for 180 minutes, for a maximum period of up to 96 hours. The battery and electronics&#xD;
      are contained in a 6 mm by 2.5 mm pack that has one adhesive surface which is applied to the&#xD;
      skin behind the ear. The adhesive is conductive and acts as the return for the device. The&#xD;
      battery pack is secured with tape.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have met with some success using P-Stim for what appear to be two tinnitus subgroups:&#xD;
      somatic pulsatile tinnitus syndrome (Levine et al., 2008) and patients with non-pulsatile&#xD;
      unilateral fluctuating tinnitus associated with deep ear pain.&#xD;
