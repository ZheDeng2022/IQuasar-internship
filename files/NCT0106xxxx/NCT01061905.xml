  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the second in a series of pilot interventions we are conducting to assess how&#xD;
      principles from behavioral economics can be applied to improve consumers' food choices. In&#xD;
      collaboration with Aramark, the food service vendor, we intend to examine if calorie labeling&#xD;
      in different formats impacts consumers choice of bottled beverages in hospital cafeterias.&#xD;
      Specifically, we will be testing whether signage that conveys to consumers the number of&#xD;
      calories in each bottled beverage will increase the number of zero-calorie beverages sold&#xD;
      relative to non-zero-calorie beverages. Likewise, we will test whether signage that conveys&#xD;
      calories in exercise equivalents increases the sale of zero-calorie beverages. Lastly, we&#xD;
      will test if signage conveying standard calorie information in conjunction with exercise&#xD;
      equivalents increases the sale of zero-calorie beverages. We will measure the differential&#xD;
      effect of each of these three formats for calorie information.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Individual behavior plays a central role in the disease burden faced by society. Many major&#xD;
      health problems in the United States such as obesity are exacerbated by unhealthy behaviors.&#xD;
      In our research, we apply ideas from behavioral economics, which integrates concepts from&#xD;
      psychology and economics, to the problem of changing health behaviors. In our research we use&#xD;
      several of the decision biases that ordinarily lead people to self-harming behavior, to&#xD;
      promote healthy behaviors instead. To date, we have been applying this approach to areas such&#xD;
      as smoking cessation, weight loss and medication compliance. We were approached by Aramark to&#xD;
      collaborate on projects to test the applicability of this approach to changing food choice.&#xD;
      Successful pilots in this area would greatly contribute to ongoing discussions nationally on&#xD;
      curbing the obesity epidemic. Our plan was to structure interventions to take advantage of&#xD;
      the fact that individuals put disproportionate value on present relative to future costs and&#xD;
      benefits, known as present-biased preferences. Present-biased preferences can be made to&#xD;
      steer people toward healthier options if they are given immediate rewards for healthy&#xD;
      behaviors with even small rewards, if they are immediate. Our first project with Aramark used&#xD;
      price discounts on zero-calorie beverages as a means to make the benefits of healthier&#xD;
      beverage choice more immediate and tangible. At 4 Aramark hospital cafeteria sites, we&#xD;
      discounted the price of zero-calorie beverages by 10% and sought to determine the impact on&#xD;
      consumers choice of these beverages. At this time, the intervention has just completed, and&#xD;
      data analysis is ongoing. Besides financial incentives, as we used in our first pilot&#xD;
      project, conveying information can also make the value of future costs and benefits more&#xD;
      immediate. It is this principle which we plan to test with the second pilot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot intervention will use a quasi-experimental, factorial design to test the impact of&#xD;
      calorie information presented on posters in different formats on beverage choice&#xD;
      (zero-calorie beverage versus other drinks). At each of 4 hospital cafeteria sites, we will&#xD;
      conduct 3 separate, consecutive interventions in which we post the following displays for&#xD;
      bottled beverages: (A) calorie information, (B) calories plus calories as exercise&#xD;
      equivalents, (C) calories as exercise equivalents. Each intervention will last 3 weeks with a&#xD;
      1 week &quot;washout&quot; period (no display) in between interventions. Therefore, the interventions&#xD;
      will run for a total of 11 weeks. The order of interventions will be randomized at each site&#xD;
      to address ordering effects. Data on bottled beverage sales (zero-calorie vs.&#xD;
      non-zero-calorie) will be collected and analyzed at the cafeteria-level. This includes&#xD;
      point-of-sale data, inventory, and stock-keeping-units (SKU) data of zero-calorie and regular&#xD;
      beverages sold weekly at each site, before, during and after the pilot. In order to make&#xD;
      appropriate comparisons across cafeterias, already-conducted site-specific demographic market&#xD;
      research analysis on customers (in aggregate) will also be considered. No individual-level&#xD;
      consumer data will be collected, obtained, or analyzed in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The unit of analysis for these studies are hospital cafeterias and cafes which are operated&#xD;
      by Aramark, the food services company. The cafeterias and cafes are located in a variety of&#xD;
      hospitals located nationwide. Through discussions with Aramark, these cafeterias have&#xD;
      volunteered to participate in this study. Representatives from Aramark have been in contact&#xD;
      with representatives from the hospitals regarding their participation. We expect 4 Aramark&#xD;
      sites will participate, which in total will include 6 cafeterias and 3 convenience stores.&#xD;
      During the intervention, customers at each site will see the calorie information displays but&#xD;
      will be under no obligation to purchase any of the beverages involved in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 11 week intervention is set to begin in early February. Data on beverage sales at each&#xD;
      site will be collected in the weeks and months leading up to the intervention and in the&#xD;
      weeks and months following the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no individual-level data collection, only aggregate monitoring of cafeteria&#xD;
      beverage inventory. As such there is almost no risk to human subjects, their privacy, or&#xD;
      confidentiality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential risks to humans include altered food choice that negatively affects their health.&#xD;
      Though we will be promoting healthier options, there is a very small possibility that such&#xD;
      promotion paradoxically may influence individuals to seek out less healthy items. There is&#xD;
      also a small risk of such promotions such as exercise labeling to effect individuals&#xD;
      psychologically in unexpected ways. The likelihood of both of these is very small and the&#xD;
      seriousness of these risks also are minor.&#xD;
