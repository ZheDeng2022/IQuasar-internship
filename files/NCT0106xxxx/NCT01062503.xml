  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bone is the most common site of metastases in prostate cancer and bone complications cause&#xD;
      substantial morbidity to this population. Phase III studies have shown that zoledronic acid&#xD;
      is effective in decreasing the morbidity associated with bone metastases. Zoledronic acid&#xD;
      (ZA) is generally well tolerated but may have side effects such as hypocalcemia, renal&#xD;
      impairment and osteonecrosis of the jaw. Administration of ZA as infrequently as once yearly&#xD;
      is sufficient to prevent osteopenia or osteoporosis. The optimal treatment interval is&#xD;
      unknown, but the drug is often empirically administered every 3-4 weeks. The cost of such&#xD;
      treatment is high, and the risk of exposing patients (especially those at low risk) to&#xD;
      potential serious side effects with uncertain benefit warrants investigation. This study will&#xD;
      determine the duration of suppression of bone turnover in prostate cancer patients with bone&#xD;
      metastases following a single infusion of Zoledronic Acid and its effect on quality of life.&#xD;

      The bone is the most common site of metastasis in men with prostate cancer, and that bone&#xD;
      metastases are associated with a significant risk of SREs. Prevention and delay in onset of&#xD;
      SREs has been demonstrated with use of ZA. The optimal dosing frequency of ZA is not known in&#xD;
      this population but it is usually given every 3-4 weeks, whereas injections as infrequently&#xD;
      as once yearly protect from bone loss in patients without bone metastases who are receiving&#xD;
      ADT. uNTX, sCTX and BAP are markers of bone turnover and bone formation that are suppressed&#xD;
      in response to ZA and are associated with the likelihood of development of an SRE. In this&#xD;
      study, we propose to determine the duration of suppression of bone turnover (all uNTX, sCTX&#xD;
      and BAP) in response to a single dose of ZA in patients with castration resistant prostate&#xD;
      cancer metastatic to bone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our objectives for this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To estimate the proportion of patients with suppression of bone turnover at 12 weeks&#xD;
           after administration of a single dose of ZA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To estimate the distribution of duration of suppression of bone turnover up to 12 weeks&#xD;
           after administration of ZA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the frequency of SREs experienced by patients in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To measure quality of life and presence of bone pain over a 12 week period in this&#xD;
           patient population by utilizing the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Bone Pain&#xD;
           (FACT-BP) and Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) questionnaires.&#xD;
