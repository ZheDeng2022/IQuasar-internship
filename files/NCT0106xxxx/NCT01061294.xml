      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy, predictability and safety of the&#xD;
      Advanced CustomVue™ iLASIK procedure (WaveScan WaveFront® System, STAR S4 IR™ Excimer Laser&#xD;
      System and IntraLase™ FS System). Patient data will be collected electronically and analyzed&#xD;
      to determine improvements in postoperative visual acuity, visual quality and residual error.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. the subject must be male or female, of any race, and at least 21 years old at the time&#xD;
             of the pre-operative examination;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. both eyes must have a BSCVA of 20/20 or better;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. both eyes must have a manifest refractive error from -0.50 D to -6.00 D, a cylinder&#xD;
             component up to -3.00 D, and a maximum manifest spherical equivalent of -6.00 D;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. both eyes must have a minimum pupil size of at least 6.0mm in dim illumination on&#xD;
             wavescan;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. both eyes must demonstrate refractive stability confirmed by clinical records or&#xD;
             previous glasses. Refractive stability shall be documented by a change of less than or&#xD;
             equal to 0.50 diopter (sphere and cylinder) at an exam at least 12 months prior to the&#xD;
             baseline examination. The astigmatic axis must also be within 15 degrees for eyes with&#xD;
             cylinder greater than 0.50 D; and&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. subjects should be willing and capable of returning for follow-up examinations for the&#xD;
             duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. subjects who use concurrent topical or systemic medications that may impair healing,&#xD;
             including but not limited to: antimetabolites, isotretinoin (Accutane®) within 6&#xD;
             months of treatment, and amiodarone hydrochloride (Cordarone®) within 12 months of&#xD;
             treatment; NOTE: The use of topical or systemic corticosteroids, whether chronic or&#xD;
             acute, is deemed to adversely affect healing and subjects using such medication are&#xD;
             specifically excluded from eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. subjects with a history of any of the following medical conditions, or any other&#xD;
             condition that could affect wound healing: collagen vascular disease, autoimmune&#xD;
             disease, immunodeficiency diseases, ocular herpes zoster or simplex, endocrine&#xD;
             disorders (including, but not limited to unstable thyroid disorders and diabetes),&#xD;
             lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis; NOTE: The presence of diabetes (either type 1 or 2),&#xD;
             regardless of disease duration, severity or control, will specifically exclude&#xD;
             subjects from eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. the subject must not have a history of prior intraocular or corneal surgery (including&#xD;
             cataract extraction), active ophthalmic disease or abnormality (including, but not&#xD;
             limited to, blepharitis, recurrent corneal erosion, dry eye syndrome,&#xD;
             neovascularization &gt; 1mm from limbus), clinically significant lens opacity, clinical&#xD;
             evidence of trauma (including scarring), or with evidence of glaucoma or propensity&#xD;
             for narrow angle glaucoma in either eye; NOTE: This includes any subject with open&#xD;
             angle glaucoma, regardless of medication regimen or control. .&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. the subject must not have any evidence of keratoconus, corneal irregularity, or&#xD;
             abnormal videokeratography in either eye;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. subjects with known sensitivity or inappropriate responsiveness to any of the&#xD;
             medications used in the post-operative course;&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. patients who do not achieve Iris registration at the time of their wavescan; and&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. patients seeking monovision.&#xD;
