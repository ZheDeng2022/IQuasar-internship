  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dialysis patients have extraordinarily high mortality rates. Cardiac diseases play an&#xD;
      important role in deaths among end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients undergoing renal&#xD;
      replacement therapy. Previous studies have shown that maintenance hemodialysis patients have&#xD;
      high prevalence of obstructive coronary artery disease. While obstructive coronary artery&#xD;
      disease is undoubtedly involved in cardiac deaths induced by acute myocardial infarction or&#xD;
      congestive heart failure and in sudden cardiac death, cardiac death can occur in hemodialysis&#xD;
      patients who have apparently no pre-existing obstructive coronary artery disease. However,&#xD;
      few studies have investigated the factors which are useful for stratifying the risk of&#xD;
      cardiac death in dialysis patients with normal coronary arteries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We recently showed that visualizing severely impaired myocardial fatty acid metabolism on&#xD;
      images can help not only to detect obstructive coronary artery disease [8], but also to&#xD;
      identify patients at high risk of cardiac death among hemodialysis patients without coronary&#xD;
      intervention or old myocardial infarction and among those with coronary revascularization by&#xD;
      percutaneous coronary artery intervention. In addition, combination of impaired cardiac fatty&#xD;
      acid metabolism with insulin resistance, which is one of the risk factors related with&#xD;
      coronary atherosclerosis, may contribute to left ventricular dysfunction in patients with&#xD;
      maintenance hemodialysis with normal coronary arteries. Impaired myocardial fatty acid&#xD;
      metabolism and insulin resistance, both of which reduce the synthesis of myocardial adenosine&#xD;
      triphosphate (ATP), are likely to be involved in fatal cardiac events by causing deficiency&#xD;
      of myocardial energy supply. In this study, we prospectively investigated the potential of&#xD;
      myocardial fatty acid metabolism and insulin resistance to predict cardiac death in&#xD;
      hemodialysis patients without pre-existing obstructive coronary artery disease.&#xD;
