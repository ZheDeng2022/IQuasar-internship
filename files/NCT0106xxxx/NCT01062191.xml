      The objective of this study is to evaluate the difference in joint range of motion of a new&#xD;
      flexible hydrogel nanoparticle wound dressing compared to typical sodium&#xD;
      carboxymethylcellulose dressing Aquacel AG for treatment of partial thickness burns.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, randomized, single blind therapeutic exploratory study to monitor&#xD;
      the range of motion of wounds treated with the new nanoparticle hydrogel dressing compared to&#xD;
      the range of motion of wounds treated with existing treatment standard (sodium&#xD;
      carboxymethylcellulose dressing) in patients with partial thickness burns. A total of 50&#xD;
      joints will be studied. The patients will be at least 7 years of age.. The Department of&#xD;
      Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation at Parkland Hospital and Health System, UT Southwestern,&#xD;
      will be asked to enroll enough patients to meet the proposed 50 joint study sites&#xD;
      (approximately 3-5 afflicted joints per patient). Children will be included in the patient&#xD;
      population if possible. Inclusion criteria for the medical condition will be at least one&#xD;
      partial thickness burn that crosses at least one peripheral joint axial to the proximal&#xD;
      interphalangeal joints. As a control, the patients will also need to have an unburned&#xD;
      contralateral joint without major internal or external joint derangement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Primary Investigator will first identify the study site and control site for each patient&#xD;
      and take the initial measurements. Trained personnel will apply the bandage to the study&#xD;
      site. No secondary bandage will be applied. Typical meticulous wound care and adequate&#xD;
      analgesic medical coverage will be provided for the duration of the study. Both the patient&#xD;
      and medical staff will be trained on patient use instructions for the dressing. The patients&#xD;
      will be monitored for a short time after application of the bandage as part of standard&#xD;
      procedure, and the patient is then allowed to go home with instructions for care. Within 2-8&#xD;
      days after application, the dressing will be inspected and range of motion will be measured&#xD;
      for both the study site and the control site. Any concomitant treatment (medications, wound&#xD;
      care) will be thoroughly documented for the duration of the study. Both dressings are&#xD;
      designed to remain on the wound until the bandage falls off, which indicates&#xD;
      re-epithelialization of the wound. The dressings should not be removed by the patient or&#xD;
      medical staff unless there are signs of infection, deterioration of bandage, or other adverse&#xD;
      event. If the bandage falls off, the patient is instructed to immediately call the medical&#xD;
      staff.&#xD;
