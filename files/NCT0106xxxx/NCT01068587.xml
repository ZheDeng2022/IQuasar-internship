      RATIONALE: MET/VEGFR2 inhibitor Foretinib and erlotinib hydrochloride may stop the growth of&#xD;
      tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow&#xD;
      to the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized phase I/II trial is studying the side effects of erlotinib&#xD;
      hydrochloride when given together with or without MET/VEGFR2 inhibitor Foretinib and to see&#xD;
      how well it works in treating patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell&#xD;
      lung cancer that has not responded to previous chemotherapy.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the recommended phase II dose of MET/VEGFR2 inhibitor Foretinibin&#xD;
           combination with standard erlotinib hydrochloride therapy in patients with locally&#xD;
           advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after failure of at least one&#xD;
           prior chemotherapy regimen, and whose EGFR-expression status is positive or unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the safety, tolerability, toxicity profile, dose-limiting toxicities, and&#xD;
           pharmacokinetic profile of MET/VEGFR2 inhibitor Foretinib and erlotinib hydrochloride in&#xD;
           this schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the correlation, if any, between the toxicity profile and pharmacokinetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the anti-tumor activity of MET/VEGFR2 inhibitor Foretinib in combination with&#xD;
           erlotinib hydrochloride as evidenced by response rates, clinical benefit (complete or&#xD;
           partial response or stable disease ≥ 8 weeks duration), and an exploratory endpoint of&#xD;
           early assessment of tumor size as a continuous variable (when compared to erlotinib&#xD;
           hydrochloride alone).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess one-year survival rate in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the correlation, if any, between response and biomarkers, including EGFR&#xD;
           gene mutation, EGFR gene amplification, EGFR gene polymorphisms, c-Met gene mutation,&#xD;
           amplification and expression, phospho-c-Met expression, K-Ras gene mutation, and&#xD;
           baseline serum HGF levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation phase I study of MET/VEGFR2 inhibitor&#xD;
      Foretinib followed by a randomized, open-label phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase I (dose-escalation) : Patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride once daily on&#xD;
           days 1-28. Patients receive oral MET/VEGFR2 inhibitor GSK1363089 once daily on days&#xD;
           15-28 during course 1 and on days 1-28 during all other courses. Courses repeat every 28&#xD;
           days until the maximum-tolerated dose of MET/VEGFR2 inhibitor Foretinib is determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples are collected on days 14 and 28 of course 1 for pharmacokinetics and day 1 of&#xD;
      courses 1 and 2 and post treatment for pharmacodynamic studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Arm I (MET/VEGFR2 inhibitor Foretinib and erlotinib hydrochloride): Patients&#xD;
                receive oral MET/VEGFR2 inhibitor Foretinib (at the recommended phase II dose&#xD;
                determined in phase I) once daily and oral erlotinib hydrochloride once daily on&#xD;
                days 1-28. Courses repeat very 28 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
                unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Arm II (erlotinib hydrochloride only): Patients receive oral erlotinib&#xD;
                hydrochloride once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence&#xD;
                of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both arms, samples are collected for pharmacodynamic studies as in phase I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at week 4 and then every 3 months&#xD;
      thereafter.&#xD;
