  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to develop a blood test to determine which patients are at risk for&#xD;
      pre-cancerous colon polyps (ACPs: Advanced Colon Polyps). The telomere length of peripheral&#xD;
      blood lymphocytes (PBLs) can be measured from a blood sample. Mechanistic pathways and the&#xD;
      investigator's preliminary data support PBL telomere length as a biomarker for ACPs. The&#xD;
      long-term goal of this project is to decrease deaths from colon cancer by using a blood test&#xD;
      to target colonoscopy for those patients who are at high risk for pre-cancerous polyps.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Telomeres are the repetitive DNA sequences that cap both ends of chromosomes. Shortening of&#xD;
      peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBL) telomeres has been associated with renal and other cancers.&#xD;
      The investigators' preliminary data shows an association between shorter PBL telomere length&#xD;
      and ACPs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Develop a DNA and data repository from individuals with advanced colon polyps (ACPs) and&#xD;
           controls&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Confirm that individuals 50 to 60 years of age with ACPs tend to have shorter peripheral&#xD;
           blood lymphocyte (PBL) telomeres than those without ACPs&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Identify a potential optimal PBL telomere length cut-off to differentiate between&#xD;
           individuals with ACPs and those without for evaluation in a larger scale study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The over reaching long term goal is to decrease disease and death from colorectal cancer&#xD;
      (CRC) using a biomarker strategy to target colonoscopy to those at higher risk.&#xD;

        Most subjects will be recruited at the time of a clinic visit in primary care, community&#xD;
        internal medicine, executive international physicals, and/or during a pre-colonoscopy visit&#xD;
        in the GI Department or GI Laboratory. The ACP subjects will be identified primarily from&#xD;
        those referred for ACP removal (EMR) and secondarily from those having screening&#xD;
        colonoscopy.&#xD;
