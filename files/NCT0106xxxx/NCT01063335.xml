      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The CB1 receptor is a protein in the brain that is targeted by the active ingredients in&#xD;
      cannabis (marijuana). Brain systems that react to cannabis may be involved in the causes and&#xD;
      symptoms of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. For instance, research studies have&#xD;
      shown that the number of CB1 receptors may be different in people with schizophrenia, and&#xD;
      there may be differences in the receptors themselves. Researchers are interested in using&#xD;
      positron emission tomography (PET) to study CB1 receptors in people with and without&#xD;
      schizophrenia, using a chemical tracer that attaches specifically to CB1 receptors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To determine whether the CB1 receptor brain protein is different in people with and without&#xD;
      schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals between 18 and 55 years of age who either have been diagnosed with&#xD;
      schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder or are healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants in the study must have previously enrolled in the National Institute of&#xD;
           Mental Health protocol A Neurobiological Investigation of Patients with Schizophrenia&#xD;
           Spectrum Disorders and Their Siblings (95-M-0150).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will provide blood samples to test for the gene that contains information&#xD;
           on the specific type of CB1 receptor each participant has.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a PET scan and/or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The PET scan will last approximately 2 hours. Participants will receive an injection of&#xD;
           a small amount of chemical tracer to improve the quality of the images taken during the&#xD;
           scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The MRI scan will last approximately 1 hour.&#xD;

      Schizophrenia is a debilitating mental disorder with a complex and multifactorial etiology.&#xD;
      The exact pathophysiological mechanisms have remained elusive, but a large body of evidence&#xD;
      points toward abnormalities in a number of brain neurotransmitter systems: dopamine,&#xD;
      glutamate, and gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA). Pharmacological studies have shown that acute&#xD;
      exposure to cannabis is able to induce psychotic symptoms in healthy individuals and&#xD;
      exacerbate symptoms in patients with an established psychotic illness. In addition,&#xD;
      epidemiological studies have established that cannabis use in early adolescence is associated&#xD;
      with an increased risk of developing schizophrenia later in life. Together, this evidence&#xD;
      suggests that the neural systems targeted by cannabis may be involved in the pathophysiology&#xD;
      of schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The brain endocannabinoid (EC) system is a recently discovered brain neurotransmission&#xD;
      system, which involves endogenous cannabinoid agents (ECs) that act upon specific receptors&#xD;
      (CB1 and CB2). CB1 receptor is abundant in the human brain and acts as an inhibitory&#xD;
      modulator of classical neurotransmitters. ECs and CB1 receptors appear to be involved in the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of schizophrenia. EC levels are elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid of&#xD;
      patients with schizophrenia, and post-mortem studies have shown increased density of&#xD;
      radioligand binding to brain CB1 receptors. To what extent CB1 receptors are involved in the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of schizophrenia in the living human brain is currently unknown. The lack of&#xD;
      suitable methods to reliably quantify CB1 receptors in the living human brain have to date&#xD;
      hindered the progress in this field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this protocol, we outline studies aiming at elucidating the role of CB1 receptors in&#xD;
      schizophrenia by using positron emission tomography (PET) and the recently developed&#xD;
      radiotracer for CB1 receptors, [18F]FMPEP-d(2). The aim of this project is to explore CB1&#xD;
      receptor abnormalities in human patients with schizophrenia. The primary hypothesis is that&#xD;
      CB1 receptor density is increased in patients with schizophrenia in comparison with healthy&#xD;
      subjects. Insight into the role of CB1 receptor function in schizophrenia may help guide&#xD;
      future development of pharmacotherapies.&#xD;
