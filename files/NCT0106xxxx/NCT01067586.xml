  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The extent of toxicity varies considerably across different brands of smokeless tobacco (ST)&#xD;
      products and data suggest that greater toxicity may result in greater health risks. However,&#xD;
      little is known about the actual extent of exposure to toxicants from current smokeless&#xD;
      tobacco products and factors that might moderate the extent of this exposure. The goals of&#xD;
      this project are to address the following questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What are the characteristics of the range of smokeless tobacco products in current use&#xD;
           and how do these products impact user behavior;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What are novel and the best measures of smokeless tobacco use, behavior and exposure;&#xD;
           and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. What are some of the determinants of smokeless tobacco use.&#xD;

      Study 1 is a multi-site descriptive study assessing tobacco toxicants in various smokeless&#xD;
      tobacco products and tobacco toxicant exposure found in 600 subjects in three sites:&#xD;
      University of MN Twin Cities, Oregon Research Institute in Eugene OR, and at West Virginia&#xD;
      University in Morgantown, WV (200 subjects per site). The study will examine the relationship&#xD;
      between brands of U.S. smokeless tobacco products that contain different levels of&#xD;
      tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNAs), other carcinogens and nicotine, and biomarkers of&#xD;
      exposure and effects on health (e.g., cardiovascular risk factors). Additionally, the study&#xD;
      will examine factors that influence the extent of toxicant exposure and effect besides the&#xD;
      levels of toxicants in the product. Subjects will attend an orientation where they will sign&#xD;
      a consent form and then return for one clinic visit where they will provide blood (UMN only),&#xD;
      urine samples, buccal samples and expectorated chews to be examined for nicotine levels,&#xD;
      toxicant exposure and potential for tobacco-related health risks. A subsample of subjects (10&#xD;
      per brand of smokeless tobacco) will be asked for a tin of their unused product for testing&#xD;
      (they will be reimbursed for the cost of their tin) and will be asked for three samples of&#xD;
      expectorated chews that will be collected, frozen and shipped to the CDC where they will be&#xD;
      analyzed for tobacco constituents. Subjects will complete several questionnaires on their&#xD;
      tobacco use history, alcohol, diet, physical and mental health. Subjects will also keep a&#xD;
      daily diary of their tobacco and alcohol use.&#xD;
