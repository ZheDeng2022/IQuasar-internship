  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose examine the effects of the dietary factor glycemic index (GI) on&#xD;
      brain areas that control food intake and hunger. This knowledge could help design dietary&#xD;
      approaches that decrease hunger, and thus promote new weight loss strategies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most individuals have great difficulty following reduced calorie diets because they&#xD;
      experience increased hunger. This process is regulated by specific brain areas. Though many&#xD;
      psychological and environmental factors are involved, physiological effects of diet may have&#xD;
      a significant impact. The postprandial rise in blood glucose, quantified by the glycemic&#xD;
      index (GI), is of particular interest. High GI meals elicit hormonal events that limit&#xD;
      availability of metabolic fuels, causing hunger and overeating, especially in people with&#xD;
      high insulin secretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our aim is to examine how postprandial changes after high versus low GI meals affect hunger&#xD;
      and brain function in areas of intake control. Specifically, we speculate that obese&#xD;
      individuals will demonstrate functional changes in brain areas of intake control and&#xD;
      increased hunger after a high versus low GI meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will recruit obese, young adults and quantify their insulin secretion during a 2-hour oral&#xD;
      glucose tolerance test. A brief practice MRI session will serve to familiarize the subjects&#xD;
      with the scanning process. During the two test sessions, standardized test meals with high&#xD;
      versus low GI will be given in a randomized, blinded cross-over design. Serial blood levels&#xD;
      of hormones, metabolic fuels, and metabolites will be correlated with perceived hunger, and a&#xD;
      perfusion MRI scan will be performed to assess brain activation during the late postprandial&#xD;
      phase, at the nadir of blood sugar and insulin levels (4 hours postprandial).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This work will inform an integrated physiological model relating peripheral postprandial&#xD;
      changes to brain function and hunger. In addition, findings may provide evidence of a novel&#xD;
      diet-phenotype, in which baseline clinical characteristics can be used to predict which&#xD;
      weight loss diet will work best for a specific individual. Metabolite profiling might shed&#xD;
      light on the mechanisms linking diet composition to brain function, and provide feasible&#xD;
      clinical markers of the identified phenotype to facilitate translation into practice.&#xD;

    <description>Subjects will be instructed to consume a liquid test meal with a low GI over 5 minutes after baseline laboratory evaluations. The low and high GI meal contain similar amounts of milk, oil, dried egg whites, equal, and vanilla extract. The low GI meal corn-starch as a carbohydrate. Both meals have similar macronutrient composition (60% carbohydrate, 15% protein, 25% fat), micronutrient profiles, physical properties, palatability and sweetness. The high vs. low GI meals have a predicted difference in GI of 90 vs. 40, and consistent with this prediction, a pilot study in obese young adults found a 2.2-fold difference in glycemic response (p&lt;0.001). The test meals will provide 25% of individual daily energy requirements.</description>
