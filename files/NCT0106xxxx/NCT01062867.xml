&#xD;
      Phase of Development Phase I (First into Man) Objectives To assess the safety, tolerability&#xD;
      and efficacy of Org 25435 as an intravenous anesthetic and to obtain preliminary&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic details of Org 25435.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology Sequential rising dose study of an intravenous anesthetic in young healthy males,&#xD;
      at up to eight dose levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Subjects 19 healthy male volunteers were included into the dose escalation part of&#xD;
      the study and an additional 7 volunteers participated in the Target Controlled Infusion (TCI)&#xD;

&#xD;
      Investigational Product Dose Mode of Administration Batch Number 1 vial 200mg Org 25435 /&#xD;
      10ml solvent for reconstitution Intended doses: 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0 and 6.0&#xD;
      mg/kg Intravenous 9J521 Duration of Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Escalation phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study treatment consisted of an intravenous infusion of Org 25435, given by Infusion&#xD;
      pump over exactly 1 minute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target Controlled Infusion phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study treatment consisted of an intravenous infusion of Org25435 given by a&#xD;
      computer-controlled infusion over 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for Evaluation Tolerability, adverse events, EEG effects, cardiovascular effects,&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (ECG), excitatory phenomena, respiratory effects, laboratory safety blood&#xD;
      analyses, pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic measurements. Efficacy Induction phenomena;&#xD;
      time of cessation of speech, eye closure, loss of eyelash reflex, eyes open on command, limb&#xD;
      movement on command and syringe drop. Other Induction phenomena; pain on injection, sign of&#xD;
      histamine release, excitatory phenomena, respiratory depression, apnea. Recovery phenomena;&#xD;
      nausea / vomiting, delirium, shivering, disturbed psychomotor function, eye opening on&#xD;
      command, spontaneous respiration, adequate respiration, move limbs on command, increased&#xD;
      saliva production.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods Formal statistical methods are not appropriate in this small pilot&#xD;
      investigative study where group sizes comprise 5 or less subjects. All data collected is&#xD;
      presented and summarized according to investigation type (Dose Escalation or TCI).&#xD;
