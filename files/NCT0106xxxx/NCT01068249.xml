    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the combination of RAD001&#xD;
      (everolimus) and Femara (letrozole) can help to control recurrent or progressive endometrial&#xD;
      cancer. The safety of this drug combination will also be studied.&#xD;

      The Study Drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Everolimus is designed to stop cancer cells from multiplying. It may also stop the growth of&#xD;
      new blood vessels that help tumor growth, which may cause the tumor cells to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Letrozole is designed to block chemical pathways that are necessary for tumor growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will take 2 pills of&#xD;
      everolimus by mouth 1 time every day. You should not open everolimus until you are about to&#xD;
      take it because it absorbs moisture and is sensitive to light. You will also take 1 pill of&#xD;
      letrozole by mouth 1 time every day. You should take letrozole at the same time as&#xD;
      everolimus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Everolimus should be taken the same time every day on an empty stomach (fasting state) or&#xD;
      after no more than a light, fat-free meal. You should wait at least 6 hours after a eating a&#xD;
      regular (not fat-free meal) before taking everolimus. You should not eat fatty foods for at&#xD;
      least 1 hour after taking everolimus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you cannot swallow the tablets, the tablets should be dissolved in a glass of about 2&#xD;
      tablespoons of water just before being taken. The tablets should then be stirred gently (for&#xD;
      a maximum of 7 minutes) until the tablets are dissolved. The contents should then be drunk.&#xD;
      If you vomit after taking the study drug, you should not take another tablet that day. If you&#xD;
      forgot to take the drug one day, you should not take an extra dose the next day but instead&#xD;
      contact your doctor for advice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be given a diary where you will record the pills you take each day. You must bring&#xD;
      this diary to each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While you are on study, you should avoid grapefruit, grapefruit juice, and other products&#xD;
      containing grapefruit. There are also certain drugs you cannot take during this study. You&#xD;
      should not take any drugs during the study without asking the study doctor first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 4 weeks, the following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs&#xD;
           (blood pressure, heart rate, breathing rate, and temperature).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, including checking your&#xD;
           liver and kidneys and measuring the levels of sugar in your blood, and levels of fat in&#xD;
           your blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will asked about any side effects you have experienced.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the disease is in the pelvis, you will have a pelvic exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for hepatitis&#xD;
           testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your pills will be counted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Week 8, the following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including a pelvic exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a CT and/or MRI scan of your chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Other areas will&#xD;
           be scanned if the doctor thinks it is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any tumors will be measured. The doctor will either feel the tumor or a CT, x-ray,&#xD;
           and/or MRI will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the disease is in your chest, you will have chest CT and/or MRI scan to check the&#xD;
           status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will asked about any side effects you have experienced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the Week 8 Visit, you will have the following tests and procedures. (If the disease has&#xD;
      partially or completely responded to the study drugs, these tests will be done around Week&#xD;
      12. If the disease is stable, these tests will be done around Week 16.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a CT and/or MRI scan of your chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Other areas will&#xD;
           be scanned if the doctor thinks it is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any tumors will be measured. The doctor will either feel the tumor or a CT scan, x-ray,&#xD;
           and/or MRI will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the disease is in your chest, you will have a chest CT and/or MRI scan to check the&#xD;
           status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the Week 12 or 16 visit, every 12 weeks, the following tests and procedures will be&#xD;
      performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a pelvic exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a CT and/or MRI scan of your chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Other areas will&#xD;
           be scanned if the doctor thinks it is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I-f the disease is in your chest, you will have chest CT and/or MRI scan to check the status&#xD;
      of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may continue receiving additional cycles of study treatment. You will be taken off study&#xD;
      if you experience intolerable side effects, the disease gets worse, the disease completely&#xD;
      responds, or the doctor thinks it is in your best interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of Treatment Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 4 weeks after the last dose of study drugs, you will have an end-of-treatment visit.&#xD;
      At this visit, the following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a pelvic exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, including checking your&#xD;
           liver and kidneys and measuring the levels of sugar in your blood, and levels of fat in&#xD;
           your blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a CT and/or MRI scan of your chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Other areas will&#xD;
           be scanned if the doctor thinks it is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the disease is in your chest, you will have chest CT and/or MRI scan to check the&#xD;
           status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your pills will be counted and any unused study drug will be returned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long Term Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After you are off study, you will be followed by your doctor on a regular basis. How often&#xD;
      these visits occur are up to you and your doctor. The following tests and procedures will be&#xD;
      performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a pelvic exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked if you have experienced any intolerable side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  If the disease is in your chest, you will have chest CT and/or MRI scan to check the&#xD;
           status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Everolimus is not FDA approved or commercially available.&#xD;
      At this time, everolimus is only being used in research. Letrozole is FDA approved and&#xD;
      commercially available for the treatment of breast cancer and ovarian cancer. The combination&#xD;
      of everolimus and letrozole in this study for the treatment of endometrial cancer is also&#xD;
      investigational. Up to 42 patients will take part in the multicenter study. Up to 42 will be&#xD;
      enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Patients must have signed an approved informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Histologically confirmed endometrial cancer (endometrioid, serous, or clear cell, or&#xD;
             mixed histology; any grade) which is considered progressive or recurrent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients may have failed no more than two prior chemotherapeutic regimens for&#xD;
             recurrent or advanced disease (including adjuvant therapy). Chemotherapy administered&#xD;
             in conjunction with radiation as a radio-sensitizer is not counted as a prior&#xD;
             treatment for recurrent or advanced disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. All patients must have measurable disease as defined by RECIST 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients must have at least one &quot;target lesion&quot; to be used to assess response on this&#xD;
             protocol as defined by RECIST. Tumors within a previously irradiated field will be&#xD;
             designated as &quot;non-target&quot; lesions, unless progression is documented or a biopsy is&#xD;
             obtained to confirm persistence at least 90 days following completion of radiation&#xD;
             therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients must have a Zubrod performance status of 0, 1, or 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients must not be of child bearing potential. Patients are considered not of child&#xD;
             bearing potential if they are surgically sterile (they have undergone a hysterectomy,&#xD;
             bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or they are postmenopausal for&#xD;
             greater than 12 months. Patients in whom ovaries are present and were not previously&#xD;
             menopausal at the time of hysterectomy, should have a serum estradiol &lt; 10 pg/mL to&#xD;
             confirm ovarian senescence.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients must have a pretreatment granulocyte count (i.e., segmented neutrophils +&#xD;
             bands) of &gt;1,500/Fl, a hemoglobin level of &gt;/=9gm/dL and a platelet count of&#xD;
             &gt;100,000/Fl. Close contact with those who have received attenuated live vaccines&#xD;

             intranasal influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio, BCG, yellow fever,&#xD;
             varicella and TY21a typhoid vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients must have an adequate renal function of &gt;50cc/min as documented by the&#xD;
             Cockcroft Gault creatinine clearance formula: Estimated GFR = (140 - age) x (weight&#xD;
             kg) divided by 72 x serum Creatinine (non-IDMS) x 0.85 (female)&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients must have adequate hepatic function as documented by a serum bilirubin &lt;/=2.5&#xD;
             mg/dL, regardless of whether patients have liver involvement secondary to tumor. Note:&#xD;
             A detailed assessment of Hepatitis B/C medical history and risk factors must be done&#xD;
             at screening for all patients. HBV DNA and HCV RNA PCR testing are required at&#xD;
             screening for all patients with a positive medical history based on risk factors&#xD;
             and/or confirmation of prior HBV/HCV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Alanine aminotransferase (SGPT) must be &lt;/= 3x institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
             unless the liver is involved with tumor, in that case, the alanine aminotransferase&#xD;
             must be &lt;/= 5 x institutional upper limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Prior to beginning therapy, at least 4 weeks must have elapsed since prior&#xD;
             chemotherapy, surgery, radiation therapy, hormonal therapy or investigational therapy.&#xD;
             Patients receiving palliative radiation therapy are exempt from the 4 week waiting&#xD;
             period.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Baseline lipid levels (triglycerides, cholesterol) must be &lt;/= grade 1. Patients are&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Patients who have previously received RAD001 or another mTOR inhibitor or letrozole or&#xD;
             another aromatase inhibitor. Use of progestational or other hormonal agents are&#xD;
             permitted provided they have not been administered within the previous 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients who have uterine sarcomas or mixed malignant mullerian tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients who have isolated recurrences (vaginal, pelvic, or paraaortic) that are&#xD;
             amenable to potentially curative treatment with radiation therapy or surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with any other severe concurrent disease, which would make the patient&#xD;
             inappropriate for entry into this study, including significant hepatic, renal, or&#xD;
             gastrointestinal diseases.&#xD;
