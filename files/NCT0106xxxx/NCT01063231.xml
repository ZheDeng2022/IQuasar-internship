      Evaluate accuracy of PCCE-2 in detecting patients with colonic polyps as compared to&#xD;
      conventional colonoscopy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Standard evaluation of subjects with suspected colon diseases includes endoscopic imaging by&#xD;
      colonoscopy and radiology testing such as: air-contrast barium enema, abdominal/pelvic CT, or&#xD;
      virtual colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Given® Diagnostic System offers an alternative approach for endoscopic visualization of&#xD;
      the colon. Advantages of the Given® Diagnostic System include the elimination of the need for&#xD;
      conscious sedation, the minimally invasive, painless nature of the exam, and the ability to&#xD;
      pursue normal daily activities immediately following the procedure . Furthermore, compared to&#xD;
      standard colonoscopy, the Given® Diagnostic System may be more readily accepted by the&#xD;
      subjects, thereby improving subjects' willingness to undergo a diagnostic evaluation of the&#xD;
      colon and comply with colorectal cancer screening recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PillCam™ SB capsule (formerly M2A® Capsule) that was cleared by the FDA- in August 2001&#xD;
      for small bowel evaluation has been ingested to date by more than 1,000,000 people worldwide&#xD;
      and is well accepted by patients and physicians as well as the professional societies.&#xD;
      However, adequate visualization of the colon cannot be achieved with the standard PillCam™ SB&#xD;
      capsule because of the anatomical and physiological properties of the colon which are&#xD;
      significantly different than the small bowel. Moreover, other issues that limit the&#xD;
      evaluation of the colonic mucosa by the standard PillCam™ SB procedure include an&#xD;
      unsatisfactory level of colon cleanliness and slow progression of the PillCam™ SB capsule&#xD;
      through the colon during the desired examination time. Therefore, the development and&#xD;
      introduction of a specially designed, customized colon capsule combined with a dedicated&#xD;
      capsule colonoscopy procedure protocol will allow for more efficient evaluation of the&#xD;
      colonic mucosa. This is expected to improve the capability of the Given® Diagnostic System to&#xD;
      detect colonic pathologies and to serve as a diagnostic and screening tool for colonic&#xD;
      disease. To date, several clinical studies have been conducted with Given® Diagnostic System&#xD;
      and the PillCam™ Colon 1 capsule A pilot multicenter study is currently being conducted with&#xD;
      a new Given® Diagnostic System and an advanced generation of the the PillCam™ Colon capsule -&#xD;
      PillCam™ Colon 2. Capsule. The new development of Given® Diagnostic System and PillCam™ Colon&#xD;
      2 capsule is primarily aimed to increase sensitivity and specificity for polyp detection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further details of the Given® Diagnostic System and PillCam™ Colon 2 capsule can be found in&#xD;
      the device description section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to evaluate the performance of the new version of Given® Diagnostic&#xD;
      System and PillCam™ Colon 2 capsule in detecting patients with polyps and other colonic&#xD;
      lesions as compared to conventional colonoscopy.&#xD;
