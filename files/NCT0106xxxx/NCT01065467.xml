  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine the safety of LBH589 as well as to find&#xD;
      out what side effects it may cause and how effective it is against melanoma. LBH589 is a drug&#xD;
      which may slow down the growth of cancer cells or kill cancer cells by blocking certain&#xD;
      enzymes, which are proteins normally produced by cells. These enzymes are known to play an&#xD;
      important role in the development and reproduction of cancer cells. It is believed that&#xD;
      LBH589 works by helping to promote the activity of enzymes which turn on the mechanisms in&#xD;
      our cells that suppress cells from becoming cancerous.&#xD;

      -  Each treatment cycle lasts 28 days. During the cycles, participants will be taking&#xD;
           LBH589 three days a week(Monday, Wednesday and Friday) every other week.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During all treatment cycles participants will have a physical exam and will be asked&#xD;
           general questions about their health and specific questions about any problems that they&#xD;
           may be having. Participants will be seen at least weekly during the first cycle and then&#xD;
           at least monthly while they remain on the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests will be taken to check blood cell counts, how well their organs are&#xD;
           functioning and to test for any infections. These blood samples will be obtained prior&#xD;
           to the start of every cycle and at least weekly during the first cycle on this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the participant is a woman of child-bearing potential, she will be asked to undergo&#xD;
           either a blood test or provide a urine specimen to check for pregnancy before starting&#xD;
           cycle 1 and prior to the start of all subsequent cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  As it is possible for LBH589 to affect the rhythm of the heart, EKGs will be checked&#xD;
           frequently during participation on this study. These EKGs will be performed at the&#xD;
           following time points: Cycle 1, day 1; Cycle 1, day 5; Cycle 1, Day 8; Cycle 1 day 15;&#xD;
           and day 1 of each subsequent cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CT scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis and an MRI of the brain will be performed&#xD;
           after every 2 cycles or every 56 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A second sample of the participant's tumor will be removed at the end of the first cycle&#xD;
           on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be in this research study for at least 2 months and may continue on&#xD;
           the study of they are benefitting from the drug and are not experiencing any serious&#xD;
           side effects.&#xD;
