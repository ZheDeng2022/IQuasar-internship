  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies have demonstrated that PPARγ as well as diet control could improve glycemic&#xD;
      control, decrease serum ALT level, decrease hepatic fat distribution, and increase&#xD;
      intrahepatic insulin sensitivity. The purposes of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Primary aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Comparison between Pioglitazone and placebo groups in terms of steatosis and liver&#xD;
           function tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluation of clinical safety of Pioglitazone&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Secondary aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Comparison between Pioglitazone and placebo groups in terms of liver necroinflammation&#xD;
           and fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The impact of Pioglitazone on the related metabolic index, including insulin&#xD;
           resistance(HOMA-IR), newly-onset diabetes, metabolic syndrome, lipid profiles (T-Chol,&#xD;
           HDL-C, LDL-C, TG).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Comparison between Pioglitazone and placebo groups in terms of high-sensitive C-reactive&#xD;
           protein changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Interventional aim: Assessment the association between magnetic resonance imaging study&#xD;
      and intrahepatic fat distribution before and after Pioglitazone treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pioglitazone belongs to thiazolidinediones and anti-diabetes drug which decreases the insulin&#xD;
      resistance. It increases the use of glucose of peripheral tissues and decrease the production&#xD;
      of glucose from liver and dose not influence the production of insulin. It is agonist of&#xD;
      peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ) and by binding to the receptors of&#xD;
      PPARγ in various tissues it has effects on transcription of the insulin-dependent gene. In&#xD;
      animal model, pioglitazone has shown to influence the metabolism by the insulin-dependent&#xD;
      mechanism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have demonstrated that PPARγ as well as diet control could improve glycemic&#xD;
      control, decrease serum ALT level, decrease hepatic fat distribution, and increase&#xD;
      intrahepatic insulin sensitivity. Meanwhile, PPARγ could also prevent the development of&#xD;
      alcohol-induced steatohepatitis, improve hepatic necroinflammatory activity, and decrease&#xD;
      lipid deposition. It is not yet clearly known how the effect of P-PARγ agonist among Asian&#xD;
      peoples.&#xD;
