      Background and Rationale: The most commonly seen disabilities in stroke patients are shoulder&#xD;
      injuries such as shoulder pain, glenohumeral subluxation, spasticity of shoulder muscles,&#xD;
      soft-tissue trauma, rotator cuff tears, and shoulder-hand syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taping is widely used in the field of rehabilitation as both means of treatment and&#xD;
      prevention of sports related injuries. Scarce information is available regarding the use of&#xD;
      shoulder taping in preventing shoulder injuries in stroke patients. Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To find out the effectiveness of taping technique with conventional treatment versus sham&#xD;
      taping and conventional treatment in prevention of shoulder injuries in patients with acute&#xD;
      stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taping technique with conventional treatment will be superior to conventional treatment alone&#xD;
      in preventing shoulder injuries in patients with acute stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Research setting: Stroke unit, department of Neurology, Christian Medical College&#xD;
      (CMC) Ludhiana, Punjab, India and College of Physiotherapy, CMC Ludhiana.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: prospective, randomized, outcome blinded trial (PROBE design). Study period:&#xD;
      Prospective for 18 months from May 2009 All stroke patients with upper limb weakness within&#xD;
      48 hours after the ictus and with Brunnstrom's stage of recovery 1 and 2 will be included in&#xD;
      the study. Patients will be randomized into two groups using lottery method. The treatment&#xD;
      arm group(Group I) include shoulder taping with conventional techniques that is(positioning,&#xD;
      handling technique and passive range of motion exercises) and the control arm (Group II)&#xD;
      include sham taping with conventional techniques with sham taping. A total of 80 patients in&#xD;
      each group will be included. The plastic micropore and elastic adhesive tape will be used for&#xD;
      taping the affected shoulder. The sham taping will be done using the same tapes but without&#xD;
      stretching the concerned muscles and joints. The tapes will be changed every 3 days and will&#xD;
      remain for 14 days. The outcome measures are as follows; Primary: Pain: Visual Analog Scale&#xD;
      and Activities of daily living: Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI); Secondary: Range&#xD;
      of motion: using a Goniometer. The outcome will be assessed by an independent physiotherapist&#xD;
      who will be blinded to the clinical details. Patients will be followed-up at 14 days and 30&#xD;
      days. Statistical analyses will be done using SPSS software version 16.&#xD;

      Background and Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stroke is the second leading cause of death and a major cause of disability worldwide.&#xD;
      Two-thirds of stroke deaths worldwide occur in developing countries. According to recent&#xD;
      reports from India the incidence and 30-day case fatality rates are higher than the developed&#xD;
      countries. In both rural and urban India there has been a rise in the non-communicable&#xD;
      diseases like stroke and coronary artery disease. In developing countries the average age of&#xD;
      stroke is 15 years less than that of developed countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been estimated that by 2021, the stroke related &quot;disability adjusted life years&quot;&#xD;
      (DALY) would become 61 million, and 52 million would be in developing nations. According to&#xD;
      recent studies 55-70% of stroke survivors become fully independent by one year and 7-16%&#xD;
      remain completely disabled. Prominent residual spasticity occurs in 46% of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shoulder Injuries in Stroke The most commonly seen disabilities in stroke patients are&#xD;
      shoulder injuries which are more common during sub-acute phase of stroke. Pain in the&#xD;
      affected shoulder often referred to as hemiplegic shoulder pain, is a common complication.&#xD;
      The other types of shoulder injuries include glenohumeral subluxation, spasticity of shoulder&#xD;
      muscles, soft-tissue trauma, rotator cuff tears, and shoulder-hand syndrome or reflex&#xD;
      sympathetic dystrophy. Shoulder injuries can negatively affect rehabilitation outcomes as&#xD;
      good shoulder function is a pre-requisite for successful transfers, maintaining balance,&#xD;
      performing activities of daily living and for effective hand function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomechanics of shoulder injuries in stroke patients A stroke patient with upper limb&#xD;
      weakness tends to place the arm in a resting position and this promotes shortening of the&#xD;
      shoulder adductors and internal rotators, and the elbow, wrist and hand flexors. This&#xD;
      habitual posturing of the upper limb can result in adaptive changes to muscle tissue that&#xD;
      impede both passive and active joint movement.As motor power returns, the pattern of recovery&#xD;
      may be imbalanced, with individual muscles developing strength at different rates or there&#xD;
      may be increased tone in certain muscle groups. Imbalanced motor return and persistent&#xD;
      attempts to move with increased activation of just one muscle group can pull the scapula and&#xD;
      humerus into abnormal postures. When this posture is maintained, the resting length of the&#xD;
      surrounding muscles may either shorten or lengthen, thereby disrupting the normal&#xD;
      biomechanics of that joint. In addition in flaccid stage, the scapula assumes a depressed and&#xD;
      downward rotated position, as the paretic serratus anterior and upper part of trapezius&#xD;
      muscle no longer support the scapula. The combination of flaccid supportive musculature and a&#xD;
      downward rotated scapula predisposes the head of humerus to undergo inferior subluxation&#xD;
      relative to the glenoid fossa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment options for shoulder injuries in stroke patients The ideal management of hemiplegic&#xD;
      shoulder pain is to prevent it happening in the first place. Various strategies have been&#xD;
      employed in the prophylaxis of hemiplegic shoulder pain. For prophylaxis to be effective, it&#xD;
      must be begin immediately after the stroke. Early passive shoulder range of motion, and&#xD;
      supporting and protecting the involved shoulder in the early flaccid stage, local treatments&#xD;
      such as heat and cold therapy, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, functional&#xD;
      electrical stimulation, range of motion exercises, EMG biofeedback are regarded as important&#xD;
      steps to reduce the development of shoulder pain. Careful positioning and handling of the&#xD;
      limb are thought to prevent hemiplegic shoulder pain, but there is a range of opinions about&#xD;
      how correct limb positioning is best achieved. Careful positioning of the shoulder serves to&#xD;
      minimize subluxation and later contractures as well as possibly promote recovery, while poor&#xD;
      positioning may adversely affect symmetry, balance and body image. Through correct&#xD;
      positioning, the development of shoulder pain can be prevented. However, the effectiveness of&#xD;
      any of these methods in preventing shoulder injuries has yet to be established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taping is widely used in the field of rehabilitation as both means of treatment and&#xD;
      prevention of sports related injuries.The essential function of tape is to provide support&#xD;
      during movement. Taping is a treatment method used in conjunction with other therapeutic&#xD;
      techniques in the treatment of various musculoskeletal and neuromuscular deficits. It helps&#xD;
      to support or inhibit muscle function, support joint structure, reduce soft tissue&#xD;
      inflammation, and reduce pain. It also can produce feedback to the muscle to maintain&#xD;
      preferred postural alignment. Various taping materials have been used in rehabilitation&#xD;
      (Kinesio tape, Leukotape, Cover-roll stretch tape).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scarce information is available regarding the use of shoulder taping in preventing shoulder&#xD;
      injuries in stroke patients. Peters and Lee, 2003 studied a single stroke patient during the&#xD;
      sub-acute phase of stroke. The patient reported decrease in pain, improvement in activities&#xD;
      of daily living and range of motion of the shoulder. However there are no controlled studies&#xD;
      using large number of stroke patients. Moreover the effectiveness of taping in conjunction&#xD;
      with other therapeutic activities to facilitate improvement in restoring functional use of&#xD;
      the upper extremity during the acute phase of stroke has not been studied. Shoulder taping&#xD;
      may prove to be economically sensible by preventing shoulder subluxation which would decrease&#xD;
      the number of therapy treatment sessions. Taping materials are locally available and it could&#xD;
      be an affordable solution to prevent shoulder injuries following stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study goal, objectives and main research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To find out the effectiveness of shoulder taping technique with conventional treatment versus&#xD;
      sham taping and conventional treatment in prevention of shoulder injuries in patients with&#xD;
      acute stroke.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Stroke Unit, Department of Neurology, and College of Physiotherapy, Christian Medical College&#xD;
      and Hospital, Ludhiana&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Prospective, randomized, outcome blinded trial (PROBE design).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and sampling techniques:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A target sample size of 160 was chosen to provide 90% power (alpha=0•.05) with 25% drop-out&#xD;
      to detect a minimum reduction in VAS of 38 in the intervention group based on the assumption&#xD;
      that mean reduction in VAS score is 27 (SD 18) in control group. The sample size of 160 also&#xD;
      had 90% power (alpha=0•.05) with 25% drop-out to detect a minimum of 20 reduction in SPADI&#xD;
      score in the intervention group based on the assumption that mean reduction in SPADI score is&#xD;
      12 (SD12) in control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All consecutive stroke patients who give consent will be randomised in a blinded fashion to&#xD;
      two treatment groups using lottery method. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient groups The randomization will be done by an office personnel who will be unaware of&#xD;
      the clinical details of the patients Group 1: patients will be given conventional treatment&#xD;
      i.e. positioning, handling technique, passive range of motion exercises and taping of the&#xD;
      affected shoulder Group 2: patients will be given conventional treatment alone which includes&#xD;
      sham taping of the affected shoulder&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study definitions Stroke will be defined as per WHO: Syndrome of rapidly developing symptoms&#xD;
      and signs of focal, and at times global, loss of cerebral function lasting more than 24 hours&#xD;
      or leading to death, with no apparent cause other than that of vascular origin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All stroke patients within first 48 hours after the onset of symptoms will be approached for&#xD;
      inclusion&#xD;

      Data management and analysis plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data entry operator will enter the patient data. Statistical Analyses will be done using SPSS&#xD;
      software version 16. Summary statistics including frequency, mean and standard deviation of&#xD;
      variables of interest will be generated. Comparison of means of the continuous variables&#xD;
      between the two treatment groups will be done using Student-t test, and the binary variables&#xD;
      using Chi-square test. The means of the outcome measures (scores of visual analog scale,&#xD;
      range of movements of shoulder and shoulder pain and disability index) at admission will be&#xD;
      compared with the values at day 14 and day 30 using Student-t test between the two groups. A&#xD;
      p value of &lt;0.05 will be considered significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implications of study results on patient safety practice and/or interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be using locally available tapes such as plastic micropore and elastic&#xD;
      adhesive tapes for taping the shoulder. They are easily available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study has wider application if the taping technique is found effective,&#xD;
      particularly in developing countries where resources are sparse. This simple technique will&#xD;
      prevent stroke disability due to shoulder injuries and help in rehabilitation of stroke&#xD;
      victims.&#xD;
