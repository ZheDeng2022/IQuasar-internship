      The primary aim of this trial is to determine the effect of a short course (i.e., 3 cycles)&#xD;
      of low-dose Bortezomib (Velcade) on bone remodeling and on disease progression. The dose of&#xD;
      bortezomib used in this trial of 0.7 mg/m2 is the lowest dose which has shown efficacy in the&#xD;
      3 largest monotherapy trials with bortezomib. 17% of patients in the APEX, 9% patients in&#xD;
      CREST and 24% in SUMMIT trials were treated with 0.7 mg/m2 dosages. Bortezomib will be given&#xD;
      on days 1, 8, 15, 22 over 42 days to reduce the incidence of possible drug related side&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effect of Velcade at 0.7 mg/m2 dose on inducing osteoblast activation as&#xD;
           measured by ALP and other bone markers in patients with relapsed/refractory myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the association between osteoblastic activation and myeloma response to&#xD;
           Velcade.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify predictive factors for Velcade-associated osteoblastic activation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma (MM) accounts for approximately 1% of all malignancies and 10% of&#xD;
      hematological tumors, representing the second most frequently occurring hematological&#xD;
      malignancy in the United States. At any one time, 50,000 people suffer from MM, and&#xD;
      approximately 15,000 are diagnosed each year. The median age is approximately 65 years,&#xD;
      although occasionally MM occurs in the second decade of life. Myeloma is a disease of&#xD;
      neoplastic plasma cells that synthesize abnormal amounts of immunoglobulin or immunoglobulin&#xD;
      fragments. Myeloma is the only hematological malignancy associated with bone disease. Myeloma&#xD;
      is a B-cell neoplasia characterized by clonal expansion of plasma cells in the bone marrow.&#xD;
      It is the most malignant stage of plasma cell dyscrasias, which also include the precursor&#xD;
      stages of MGUS and indolent or smoldering myeloma. Myeloma is frequently associated with&#xD;
      lytic bone disease that is responsible for the most debilitating manifestations of the&#xD;
      disease, including bone pain and fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone disease in myeloma results from the activation of osteoclast and suppression of&#xD;
      osteoblast activity in the myelomatous bone marrow. Change in bone turnover rates, expressed&#xD;
      as increased osteoblastic and osteoclastic activity, precede the progression pf MGUS or&#xD;
      smoldering myeloma to overt myeloma by as long as three years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with bisphosphonates reduces bone resorption and also to some degree, bone&#xD;
      formation, and over the long-term moderately increases bone density. Other approved&#xD;
      antiresorptive therapies have been shown to reduce the risk of fracture in osteoporotic&#xD;
      women, but none have been shown to restore normal bone mass or strength. As a result,&#xD;
      treatments that directly stimulate bone formation may overcome these limitations, increase&#xD;
      bone mass, and improve the quality of life of myeloma patients. Bone disease is responsible&#xD;
      for the most severe complications associated with multiple myeloma. As treatment and survival&#xD;
      of myeloma patients improve, new therapies to improve complications are important and vitally&#xD;
      needed VELCADE™ (bortezomib) for Injection is a small molecule proteasome inhibitor developed&#xD;
      by Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., (Millennium) as a novel agent to treat human&#xD;
      malignancies. VELCADE is currently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration&#xD;
      (US FDA) and it is registered in Europe for the treatment of multiple myeloma patients who&#xD;
      have received at least one prior therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical response to bortezomib observed in a 63-year-old woman with multiple myeloma and&#xD;
      the parallel increase in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) has led us and other groups to evaluate&#xD;
      the correlation between bone anabolism and myeloma response to bortezomib. After similar&#xD;
      elevations were noted in patients responding to bortezomib, thalidomide, dexamethasone&#xD;
      combination, ALP levels were analysed in two large bortezomib trials (Roodman, 2008).&#xD;
      Giuliani and coworkers (2007) found that bortezomib significantly increased the activity of&#xD;
      the critical osteoblast transcription factor, RUNX2, in human osteoblast precursors and&#xD;
      stimulated bone nodule formation in vitro. Importantly, they found a significant increase in&#xD;
      the number of osteoblasts per mm2 of bone tissue and the number of RUNX2 positive&#xD;
      osteoblastic cells in marrow biopsies from myeloma patients that responded to bortezomib.&#xD;
      Again, the effect on osteoblasts was only seen in patients whose myeloma responded to&#xD;
      bortezomib, making it difficult to distinguish if the increase in osteoblast activity was due&#xD;
      to the anti-myeloma effects of bortezomib or direct effects on osteoblasts or both. Terpos&#xD;
      and colleagues (2006) have reported that bortezomib also decreased DKK1 and RANKL&#xD;
      concentrations and normalized bone remodeling indices in the serum of patients with relapsed&#xD;
      myeloma. However, the majority of patients that showed an increase in bone formation markers&#xD;
      also showed an antitumor response to bortezomib, making it unclear if the stimulatory effects&#xD;
      on bone formation were secondary to the effects of bortezomib on myeloma or due to direct&#xD;
      effects on osteoblast differentiation After similar elevations were noted in patients&#xD;
      responding to bortezomib, thalidomide, dexamethasone combination, ALP levels were analysed in&#xD;
      two large bortezomib trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We first completed a retrospective analysis of large Phase 3 trials comparing ALP levels in&#xD;
      responders (≥PR) vs nonresponders (≤PR) patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data obtained from the APEX Crest and Summit protocols, have shown that a total of 85 myeloma&#xD;
      patients were treated with bortezomib at the dose of 0.7 mg/m2 for different reasons with&#xD;
      significant antimyeloma efficacy for multiple cycles. This dose (0.7 mg/m2) will be used in&#xD;
      this trial to test if the antimyeloma activity of bortezomib is still associated to bone&#xD;
      anabolic effect. Data for the APEX, summit, and CREST trials is on file at Millennium&#xD;
      Pharmaceuticals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given that this study is a continuation of a previous protocol (UARK 2004-22) when at the&#xD;
      dose of 1.3 and 1.0 mg/m2 an antimyeloma effect and associated bone formation were observed.&#xD;
      This trial will test the effect of 0.7 mg/m2 (which has been shown to be effective on&#xD;
      antimyeloma treatment) on bone formation to determine the minimal dose associated to bone&#xD;
      effect.&#xD;
