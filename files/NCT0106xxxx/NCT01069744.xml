  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The development of sucking behaviors in preterm infants is thought to reflect neurobehavioral&#xD;
      maturation and organization. From a clinical perspective, the ability to feed depends upon a&#xD;
      coordinated sucking, swallowing and breathing pattern. In preterm infants less than 32 weeks&#xD;
      gestation, this ability is not usually effective enough to sustain full oral feeds. In the&#xD;
      interim, infants are fed by gavage tube until they are mature enough to take milk directly&#xD;
      from the breast or bottle (Pinelli, Symington, 2005). Non-nutritive sucking has been used&#xD;
      during gavage feeding and in the transition from gavage to breast/bottle feeding. The&#xD;
      rationale for this intervention is that non-nutritive sucking facilitates the development of&#xD;
      sucking behavior and improves digestion of enteral feeds.&#xD;

      Study Design Primary Hypothesis The use of a patterned oral somatosensory entrainment&#xD;
      stimulation program (NTrainer©) will safely accelerate the development of oromotor skills&#xD;
      (suck) in preterm infants and is expected to significantly enhance the development of oral&#xD;
      feeding skills. Non-nutritive suck development will be assessed on several dimensions of&#xD;
      oromotor output including suck burst structure, minute-rates for suck cycle production, and a&#xD;
      novel quantitative measure of suck pattern formation known as the non-nutritive suck&#xD;
      spatiotemporal index (NNS STI) (Poore, Barlow, Wang, Estep, 2007, revision for Dev Med Child&#xD;
      Neurology; Poore, Barlow, Wang, Gu, 2007, in prep for Dev Med Child Neurol). Measures of&#xD;
      feeding skill include measurement of the transition time (days) to 100% oral feed, feed rate&#xD;
      (ml/min), pulse oximetry, and documentation of reflux or spit up events. Secondary measures&#xD;
      will include documentation of infant growth rate compared to no intervention. The growth rate&#xD;
      will be assessed by examining the change in weight, head circumference and length during the&#xD;
      28 days following initiation of oral feedings. Safety will be assessed by monitoring&#xD;
      mortality, and the occurrence of feeding problems (numbers of days when feedings are&#xD;
      withheld; ie NPO days), necrotizing enterocolitis, and aspiration events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment We will conduct a randomized control trial to evaluate the efficacy of the&#xD;
      NTrainer on suck development and oral feed performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We estimate we will need to study 100 preterm infants to test our primary hypothesis. (see&#xD;
      sample size calculations in Statistical Analysis section). Enrollment will include 50&#xD;
      treatment / 50 controls. Expected ethnic proportion for Kansas [US Federal Census]African&#xD;
      American 5.9%, Asian American 1.8%, Hispanic American 5.6%,Native American 0.9%, White 86.3%,&#xD;
      All others --&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Documentation of informed consent. Informed consent will be obtained by the principal&#xD;
           investigator(s) and/or designated research staff for each subject before being&#xD;
           randomized into the study. We have a PACIRB approved Spanish version of the consent form&#xD;
           available for interested participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Gestational age between 23 weeks and 0/7 days and 34 weeks as per the best estimate by&#xD;
           the neonatologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. If subject is transferred to another hospital, the ability to obtain follow-up data on&#xD;
           outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Ready for oral feedings. Neonates who meet eligibility criteria (A-E) will be assessed&#xD;
           by the health care team (neonatology and occupational/developmental therapist) with the&#xD;
           NTrainer beginning at 32 weeks post menstrual age (e.g., this will be 9 weeks of age for&#xD;
           a neonate born at 23 weeks estimated gestational age). If they are considered ready for&#xD;
           feedings they will be enrolled. Feeding readiness criteria include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Initiate when the health care team feels the baby is ready to try oral feeds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Hemodynamically stable. C. Stable O2 saturation levels during suck (infant will maintain&#xD;
      SpO2 levels ≥ 90 during suck).&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. Alert and active: neurologic exam appropriate for post-menstrual age E. No signs of sepsis&#xD;
      or intolerance of gastric feedings&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Gestational age &lt; 23 weeks or &gt; 34 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Any major congenital anomalies (chromosomal abnormalities, nervous system anomalies,&#xD;
           cyanotic congenital heart disease, gastroschisis, omphalocele, diaphragmatic hernia&#xD;
           and/or other major gastrointestinal anomalies).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Major neurological injury including intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH grades III or IV),&#xD;
           or periventricular leukomalacia (PVL).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Not ready for oral feedings as determined by the health care team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome Measures (Primary Study Endpoints)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The Non-Nutritive Suck SpatioTemporal Index (NNS STI) will be used to characterize the&#xD;
           emergence and integrity of the suck central pattern generator (sCPG) through&#xD;
           quantitative and statistical analyses of suck pattern stability. This procedure involves&#xD;
           the calculation of nipple compression variability across multiple suck bursts. By&#xD;
           calculating the cumulative sum of the standard deviations of an amplitude- and time-&#xD;
           normalized set of NNS pressure trajectories, suck development can be represented by a&#xD;
           single numerical value known as the NNS STI. The mathematics underlying STI are well&#xD;
           suited to quantitatively track the emergence of ororhythmic stereotypy during NNS&#xD;
           development in preterm infants (Poore, Barlow, Wang, Estep, Lee, 2007). The STI&#xD;
           indicates the degree to which the set of motor trajectories converges on a single&#xD;
           underlying template, or the stability of the neuromotor sequences exhibited by the&#xD;
           preterm infant. This approach is conceptually unique from all previous studies on suck&#xD;
           development which have attempted to characterize ororhythmic activity through parametric&#xD;
           analyses such as mean sucks per burst, sucks per second per burst, suck width and&#xD;
           intersuck width. The NNS STI will be calculated at 7, 14, 21 and 28 days after&#xD;
           randomization to assess maturation of suck coordination.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Details of the NNS STI calculation: Two minutes of the digitized ororhythmic pressure&#xD;
           waveform with the greatest number of pressure peaks greater than 1 cm H2O, reflecting&#xD;
           each infant's most active period of oromotor output, will be selected for NNS STI&#xD;
           analysis. Because analyses of NNS spatiotemporal stability depend on comparing suck&#xD;
           bursts with a fixed peak (suck cycle) number, the first five peaks from five successive&#xD;
           bursts will be identified from the two-minute ororhythmic pressure waveform sample. For&#xD;
           infants with degraded NNS pattern structure, the first five most burst-like mouthing&#xD;
           movements are identified, based on period, amplitude, and duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The selection of NNS bursts and calculation of the non-nutritive suck STI will be&#xD;
           completed with a specialized LabVIEW© software program developed in Dr. Barlow's&#xD;
           laboratory known as NNS STI. NNS STI is programmed to initially perform pressure peak&#xD;
           detection for each burst to identify the time location for each peak. After the desired&#xD;
           pressure peak locations are identified, the start- and end-points for the selected NNS&#xD;
           burst are calculated by extending the analysis window 300 samples prior to the first&#xD;
           peak and 300 samples following the fifth peak, in order to ensure accurate pressure peak&#xD;
           waveform discrimination. Amplitude and time normalization of these five bursts is&#xD;
           completed next. Time normalization is based on linear interpolation, which projects the&#xD;
           five-peak-bursts ensemble to an analysis window based on a preset abscissa scale of&#xD;
           10,000 data samples. Amplitude normalization is accomplished by deducting the mean and&#xD;
           then dividing by the standard deviation for each trajectory. The NNS STI represents the&#xD;
           cumulative sum of the standard deviations, indexed at 100 ms intervals, on the&#xD;
           normalized NNS burst waveforms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Transition-to-Oral Feed (TOF): Time from initiation of oral feedings to full independent&#xD;
           feedings (i.e., no gavage supplementation and taking at least 120-180 ml/kg/day.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Length-of-Stay (LOS) in the NICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Occurrence of any of the following during the 28 day study period:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  necrotizing enterocolitis&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  clinical suspicion of aspiration during feeding event (i.e., cough, spit-ups, O2&#xD;
                desaturation).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  number of days feeding withheld for more than 12 hours (NPO)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  death&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Growth velocity during the 28 days after initiation of oral feedings:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Weight Gain (gms/kg/day) = [wt (gms) at 28 days - bw (gms)] / bw / 28 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Head Growth (cm/wk) = [hc (cm) at 28 days - hc (cm) at birth] / 3 wks&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Occipitofrontal circumference = place measuring tape around the front of the head,&#xD;
           above the brow and the occipital area. The measuring tape should be above the ears.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Length Growth (cm/wk) = [len (cm) at 28 days - len (cm) at birth] / 3 wks&#xD;
           Abbreviations:birth weight (bw); weight (wt); grams (gms); head circumference (hc);&#xD;
           centimeters (cm),length (len) and weeks (wks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the course of the study, adverse events will be monitored to ensure that the rate of&#xD;
      reported events does not exceed the expected rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and Treatment Assignment Randomization will take place using an electronic&#xD;
      randomization schedule generated by Minitab v. 15 statistical software program. Neonates who&#xD;
      are started on a trial of oral feedings will be randomly assigned to one of two groups -&#xD;
      initiation of oral feedings with the NTrainer or to the Control group.&#xD;
