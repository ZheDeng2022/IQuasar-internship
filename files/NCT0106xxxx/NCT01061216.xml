  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study will be to assess the PK/PD responsiveness of basal ID&#xD;
      administered insulin compared to SC, and to determine the safety and local tolerability of&#xD;
      extended (two six-hour periods) microneedle insulin delivery (MID) infusion. The primary&#xD;
      endpoint will be the PK response to changes in rapid-acting insulin basal infusion rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Faster PK transitions coupled with faster PD responsiveness could provide clinical benefit,&#xD;
      compared to current subcutaneous insulin infusion. In addition, for nocturnal basal pumping,&#xD;
      more rapid insulin offset could decrease the occurrence rate and severity of hypoglycemic&#xD;
      episodes.&#xD;

      Twenty (20) male T1 diabetic subjects will be studied under manual partial glucose clamp&#xD;
      conditions over a 16 hour infusion period (approximately 36 hours of overall time in clinic).&#xD;
      Subjects will be admitted to the clinic the night before their study visit for overnight&#xD;
      stabilization in which, via insulin and/or glucose infusions, blood glucose will be&#xD;
      stabilized to approximately 140 mg/dL. Subjects will receive as background IV Humulin insulin&#xD;
      with an initial dose equivalent to one-half of their usual daily basal insulin dose. In the&#xD;
      morning the subjects will start the experimental intervention and have administered a low&#xD;
      rate stair-stepped Lispro insulin infusion profile via an infusion pump (Harvard Syringe&#xD;
      Pump, Harvard Apparatus).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The profile is designed to examine the initial &quot;on&quot; rate for microneedle insulin delivery,&#xD;
      the transition time between basal rate changes and the &quot;off-rate&quot; after insulin cessation.&#xD;
      Subjects will receive the same profile by SC infusion on a second clinic day in a randomized&#xD;
      order. PK endpoints will be established using timed blood samples. Safety and tolerability at&#xD;
      the local infusion site will also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In parallel, using a commercially available insulin pump (One Touch &quot;Ping&quot; Insulin Pump,&#xD;
      Animas) and an infusion set (either the RCS or a commercially available SC insulin infusion&#xD;
      set); a second infusion of insulin diluent will be used to assess the feasibility of&#xD;
      longer-term ID infusions (16 hours) as compared to SC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each infusion the pumps will control the fluid delivery rate and volume. In addition&#xD;
      an in-line pressure transducer will record the pressure and transfer the information to a&#xD;
      laptop computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To define the PK profile of initiation, rate change, and discontinuation of continuously&#xD;
           infused basal insulin administered either intradermally or subcutaneously over two&#xD;
           separate infusion periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the PD effect of the infused insulin as measured by time to glucose rebound&#xD;
           following discontinuation of test insulin infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the safety and tolerability of intradermally infused insulin over two six-hour&#xD;
           periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the feasibility of the research catheter set (RCS) for longer-term ID infusion&#xD;
