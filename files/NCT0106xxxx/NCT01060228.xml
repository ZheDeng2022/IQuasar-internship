    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of valproic acid (VPA) on the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (blood levels) of a single oral dose of an extended-release formulation of&#xD;
      paliperidone in healthy male volunteers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (patient will know the identity of the study drug they are taking)&#xD;
      study in healthy volunteers (only healthy men will be asked to participate in the study). The&#xD;
      primary purpose of the study is to determine how paliperidone (a schizophrenia medication)&#xD;
      and divalproex sodium (an epilepsy medication also referred to as valproic acid [VPA])&#xD;
      interact with each other to affect the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination&#xD;
      by the body. Other purposes of the study are to learn about the safety of the two study drugs&#xD;
      when taken together and to learn how healthy volunteers tolerate the two drugs when taken&#xD;
      together. Approximately 24 healthy men (referred to as healthy volunteers) will take part in&#xD;
      the study. The study will last about 40 days and will consist of a screening period beginning&#xD;
      up to 21 days before the first study drug administration followed by an open label treatment&#xD;
      period that will last approximately 20 days (Day -1 through Day 19). The purpose of the&#xD;
      screening visit is to see if healthy volunteers meet all of the requirements to participate&#xD;
      in the study. During the screening period which may require more than one visit to the study&#xD;
      clinic, the following procedures will be performed: 1) signed informed consent will be&#xD;
      obtained from healthy volunteers to document that they agree to participate in the study, 2)&#xD;
      medical history and demographic information including age, date of birth, sex, race, etc will&#xD;
      be collected, 3) a physical examination will be performed, 4) vital signs (pulse rate, blood&#xD;
      pressure, and temperature) will be measured, 5) a blood sample will be collected for routine&#xD;
      laboratory tests as well as to test for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and human immunodeficiency&#xD;
      virus (HIV), and 6) a urine sample will be collected for routine laboratory testing including&#xD;
      testing for drugs of abuse and alcohol. Healthy volunteers who meet the entry criteria for&#xD;
      enrollment at screening will be asked to check in to the study clinic the evening before the&#xD;
      first administration of study drug (Day -1) and will stay overnight in the clinic until Day&#xD;
      19. During the 20 days at the study clinic, healthy volunteers will be asked to refrain from&#xD;
      the consumption of food or beverages containing alcohol, grapefruit juice, Seville oranges,&#xD;
      or quinine (such as tonic water), use of any caffeine/xanthine-containing products (coffee,&#xD;
      tea, chocolate, cola, other soda with caffeine), and food containing poppy seeds. Healthy&#xD;
      volunteers will also be asked to refrain from jogging, strenuous exercise of all types, and&#xD;
      sunbathing while confined to the study center and for 48 hours before admission to the study&#xD;
      center. Healthy volunteers will be provided with standard meals during the 20 days of&#xD;
      confinement at the study center and may smoke throughout the study with a limit of 10&#xD;
      cigarettes or 2 cigars, or 2 pipes of tobacco per day. If a healthy volunteer has an illness&#xD;
      with a fever within 2 days of a scheduled dose of study drug, the dose of study drug will be&#xD;
      postponed until their body temperature is normal for at least 72 hours (3 days). All healthy&#xD;
      volunteers will take each study drug orally (by mouth) in the following order on the days&#xD;
      specified: 1 extended release (ER) tablet of 12 mg paliperidone on Day 1 followed by two&#xD;
      500-mg ER tablets of divalproex sodium once daily from Day 5 to 18, and 1 tablet of 12 mg&#xD;
      paliperidone ER on Day 15. Paliperidone ER tablets will be taken by healthy volunteers after&#xD;
      an overnight fast (having nothing to eat or drink except water) of at least 10 hours.&#xD;
      Divalproex sodium ER tablets can be taken at any time between 1 hour before and 1 hour after&#xD;
      a meal (except for Days 14 and 15); the morning dose on Days 14 and 15 will be administered&#xD;
      after a 10 hour fast. All study drug tablets will be swallowed whole with a glass of water&#xD;
      (tablets must not chewed, divided, dissolved, or crushed). The shells of the paliperidone ER&#xD;
      tablets are non-disintegrating and may leave the body intact. Therefore, healthy volunteers&#xD;
      may see the shells of the tablets in their stools but there is no reason for alarm. During&#xD;
      the study, healthy volunteers will have blood samples taken from a vein in their arm using a&#xD;
      needle. Each blood sample will consist of approximately 1 teaspoonful of blood. Over the&#xD;
      course of the study a total of 53 blood samples will be collected which is about a total of 9&#xD;
      ounces or just a little over a cup of blood. The blood samples will be used to evaluate the&#xD;
      primary outcome measure in the study which is the pharmacokinetics (blood levels) of a single&#xD;
      dose of orally administered paliperidone ER before and during the administration of VPA at&#xD;
      steady-state (steady state is achieved when the rate of drug absorption equals that of the&#xD;
      drug elimination and drug concentrations in blood are stable). Healthy volunteers will also&#xD;
      be monitored for safety throughout the study. Safety assessments include monitoring of&#xD;
      adverse events (side effects) and findings from clinical laboratory tests (including&#xD;
      hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis), 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) (ECGs are&#xD;
      used to trace the electrical activity of the heart), vital signs measurements, and physical&#xD;
      examinations. A review of concomitant medications/therapies taken by healthy volunteers&#xD;
      during the study will also be performed. Healthy volunteers will complete the study after the&#xD;
      final blood sample is collected on Day 19. Before leaving the study center, end of study&#xD;
      procedures performed will include a physical examination, vital signs measurements, routine&#xD;
      clinical laboratory tests, and an ECG. All healthy volunteers will receive a single oral (by&#xD;
      mouth) dose of one 12 mg paliperidone extended release (ER) tablet on Day 1 followed by two&#xD;
      500-mg divalproex sodium ER tablets (each tablet equivalent to 500 mg of valproic acid) for&#xD;
      oral administration once daily from Day 5 to 18 and a single oral dose of one 12 mg&#xD;
      paliperidone ER tablet on Day 15. All drugs will be swallowed with 240 mL of noncarbonated&#xD;
      water and must be swallowed whole, not chewed, divided, dissolved, or crushed.&#xD;
