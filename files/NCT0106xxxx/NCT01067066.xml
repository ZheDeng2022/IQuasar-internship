  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the Phase I portion of this study is to find the highest tolerable dose of TPI&#xD;
      287 that can be given in combination with Temodar (temozolomide) to patients with metastatic&#xD;
      melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the Phase II portion of this study is to learn if TPI 287, given in combination&#xD;
      with temozolomide, can control metastatic melanoma. The safety of this combination will also&#xD;
      be studied. NOTE: Study stopped before progressing to Phase II portion.&#xD;

      Study Drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      TPI 287 is designed to block tumors from growing by preventing cancer cells from dividing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Temozolomide is designed to kill cancer cells by causing breaks in the DNA (genetic material)&#xD;
      of the cell.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study&#xD;
      group based on when you joined this study. Up to 8 groups of 6 participants will be enrolled&#xD;
      in the Phase I portion of the study, and up to 64 participants will be enrolled in Phase II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are enrolled in the Phase I portion, the dose of TPI 287 and temozolomide you receive&#xD;
      will depend on when you joined this study. The first group of participants will receive the&#xD;
      lowest dose level of TPI 287 and temozolomide. Each new group will receive a higher dose of&#xD;
      TPI 287 and temozolomide than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen.&#xD;
      If any of these participants have a dose limiting toxicity, 6 additional participants will be&#xD;
      added at the same dose. If a dose limiting toxicity occurs again, the dose level below this&#xD;
      will be considered the maximum tolerated dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If any participant experiences a life threatening side effect, no additional participants&#xD;
      will be enrolled into that dose level and no higher doses will be given. An additional 3&#xD;
      participants will be treated at the dose level below the one with life threatening toxicity.&#xD;
      Once the maximum tolerated dose of the combination is found, Phase II of the study will open.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are enrolled in the Phase II portion, you will receive the drug combination at the&#xD;
      highest dose that was tolerated in the Phase I portion&#xD;
&#xD;
      Central Venous Catheter (CVC):&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have a CVC placed. A CVC is a sterile, flexible tube that will be placed into a&#xD;
      large vein while you are under local anesthesia. Your doctor will explain this procedure to&#xD;
      you in more detail, and you will be required to sign a separate consent form for this&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive TPI 287 by vein over 1 hour (+/- 10 minutes) on Days 1, 8, and 15 (+/- 1&#xD;
      day) of each 28 day study cycle. Before you receive each dose of TPI 287, you will receive&#xD;
      dexamethasone, Benadryl (diphenhydramine), and Pepcid (famotidine) by vein to help prevent&#xD;
      allergic reaction. You will also receive drugs to prevent nausea and vomiting. Your vital&#xD;
      signs will be measured before and 30 minutes following the end of the infusion of TPI 287.&#xD;
      Your vitals will be measured more often, if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will take temozolomide tablets by mouth on Days 1-5 at bedtime. You should not eat for at&#xD;
      least 1 hour before and 1 hour after taking temozolomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before each cycle, your performance status will be recorded and you will have a physical&#xD;
      exam. You will also be asked about any symptoms you may be experiencing and any drugs you are&#xD;
      taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 1, 8, and 14 of each cycle:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests before you receive TPI 287.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 22 of each cycle:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 8 weeks, you will have a CT scan or MRI scan to check the status of the disease. If you&#xD;
      have brain metastasis, you will have an MRI of the brain every 4 weeks. If you do not have&#xD;
      brain metastasis, you will have MRI of the brain every 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will continue taking the study drugs for as long as you are benefitting. You will be&#xD;
      taken off study if the disease gets worse or intolerable side effects occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Treatment Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 4 weeks after you stop taking TPI 287 in combination with Temozolomide, you have an&#xD;
      end-of-study visit. At this visit, the following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any complications or side effects you may be experiencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If your doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a CT scan or MRI scan to check the&#xD;
           status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. TPI 287 is not FDA approved or commercially available. At&#xD;
      this time, TPI 287 is being used in research only. Temozolomide is FDA approved and&#xD;
      commercially available for primary brain cancer. The use of temozolomide in combination with&#xD;
      TPI 287 is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 106 patients will take part in this study. All patients will be enrolled at MD&#xD;
      Anderson.&#xD;

             with Docetaxel, Paclitaxel or other taxanes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. All patients must sign an informed consent indicating that they are aware of the&#xD;
             investigational nature of this study in keeping with the policies of this hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients must have a Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group status of &lt;/=2.&#xD;

             nitrosoureas, 3 weeks from procarbazine administration, and 1 week for non-cytotoxic&#xD;
             agents, e.g., interferon, tamoxifen, thalidomide, cis-retinoic acid, etc.&#xD;
             (radiosensitizer does not count). Any questions related to the definition of&#xD;
             non-cytotoxic agents should be directed to the Study Chair.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients must have adequate bone marrow function (ANC &gt;/= 1,500/mm3 and platelet count&#xD;

             transaminase (SGOT) &lt;/= 2.5 times normal, bilirubin &lt;/= 2 mg/dl), and adequate renal&#xD;
             function (BUN and creatinine &lt;/=1.5 times institutional normal) prior to starting&#xD;
             therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. TPI 287 may interfere with coumadin dosing and patients who are taking this&#xD;
             combination will require monitoring of their PT, PTT and international normalized&#xD;
             ratio (INR).&#xD;
&#xD;

             methods (abstinence, intrauterine device, oral contraceptive or double barrier&#xD;
             device), and must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 7 days prior to&#xD;
             beginning treatment on this trial. Sexually active men must also use acceptable&#xD;
             contraceptive methods for the duration of time on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patient should be 15 years of age or older&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with brain metastases must not be taking primidone, carbamazepine,&#xD;
             phenobarbital or phenytoin anticonvulsants (Enzyme-Inducing Anti-Epileptic Drugs).&#xD;

             months, or serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Because of the concerns of potentially harmful interactions of TPI 287and other&#xD;
             medications taken by patients who are HIV positive or have AIDS related diseases,&#xD;
             patients who are HIV positive are not be eligible for entry into this study. Only&#xD;
