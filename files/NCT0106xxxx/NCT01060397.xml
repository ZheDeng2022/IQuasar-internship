  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heavy alcohol consumption leads to various health problems and is now recognised to be an&#xD;
      important public health problem. This is evidenced by the huge media attention recently&#xD;
      focused on the use and misuse of alcohol, particularly by younger patients. At least 1 in 20&#xD;
      of the population in the UK are physically and psychologically dependent on alcohol. This not&#xD;
      only has consequences for the physical and psychological well-being of these patients, but&#xD;
      has adverse consequences for their family, work life and society in general. Current&#xD;
      treatments are mostly delivered in specialist units, which are few in number meaning that few&#xD;
      patients get access to these services. This leads to a vicious cycle which results in&#xD;
      multiple hospital admissions, ineffective treatments and continual drinking. It is therefore&#xD;
      vital the investigators develop alternative effective treatments for these patients which can&#xD;
      interrupt this vicious cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients who drink heavily, but are not yet alcohol-dependent, a treatment called brief&#xD;
      intervention can help reduce overall alcohol consumption, and improve health and wellbeing.&#xD;
      However, whether a similar intervention can help alcohol-dependent patients has not yet been&#xD;
      established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators aim to identify, treat and support alcohol-dependent&#xD;
      individuals. Using an enhanced form of BI (termed extended brief intervention, EBI) as the&#xD;
      basis of clinical care, the investigators will undertake a randomised trial comparing EBI&#xD;
      with usual clinical care. The investigators will use various clinical and behavioural&#xD;
      measures to assess the effectiveness of this treatment. The investigators will also be asking&#xD;
      patients how they felt, and what they think of their treatment and the professionals&#xD;
      delivering that treatment. If EBI is shown to be effective and is not too costly, it could&#xD;
      provide a national framework for treatment of alcohol-dependent patients. This could&#xD;
      potentially improve both the opportunities to access treatment and the choice of treatments&#xD;
      available to patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesis is that Extended Brief Interventions (EBI) delivered to&#xD;
      alcohol-dependent patients in a hospital setting by an Alcohol Specialist Nurse (ASN) will be&#xD;
      effective in reducing overall alcohol consumption and improving the standard measures of&#xD;
      alcohol dependence.&#xD;

      Hypothesis Extended Brief Interventions (EBI) delivered to alcohol-dependent patients in a&#xD;
      hospital setting by an Alcohol Specialist Nurse (ASN) will be effective when compared to&#xD;
      usual care; in reducing overall alcohol consumption and improving on the standard measures of&#xD;
      alcohol dependence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall aim To test the clinical and cost effectiveness of extended brief interventions for&#xD;
      individuals with alcohol dependence in an acute hospital setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine whether brief interventions reduce overall alcohol consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine whether brief interventions are effective in the treatment of alcohol&#xD;
           dependence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine whether brief interventions reduce the length of stay in hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Determine how patients feel about being approached in an opportunistic manner for&#xD;
           screening for alcohol-related problems and subsequently being asked to be part of a&#xD;
           research trial (Refer to Part B of the protocol. Qualitative analysis of patient views&#xD;
           and experience).&#xD;

           Setting&#xD;
&#xD;
      Southport and Ormskirk district general hospital. This is an acute NHS Hospital Trust with an&#xD;
      Emergency department (ED) based within the North West region of England and currently has no&#xD;
      input available for patients with alcohol-related admissions or attendances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on a previous study by ourselves on dependent drinkers receiving interventions from an&#xD;
      ASN, it is expected that 55% of such patients will display a fall in SADQ score between&#xD;
      baseline and 12 weeks' follow up. Another confounder in this area of research is the&#xD;
      phenomenon of natural recovery (NR). The natural recovery rate over this time period expected&#xD;
      in the control group is expected to be no more than 25% (the literature ranges from 12% with&#xD;
      a treatment population [20] up to 35% within a general lifetime population [22, 23]). In&#xD;
      order to detect this difference between the groups (55% vs. 25%) with 90% power at the 5%&#xD;
      significance level, approximately 65 patients are required in each group. In order to allow&#xD;
      for an estimated 50% drop out rate (observed in previous studies in similar patients), 130&#xD;
      patients will be recruited per group. It is estimated that at least 5 eligible patients will&#xD;
      be recruited per week, and thus this target should be achieved within the 12 month&#xD;
      recruitment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis A full statistical analysis plan will be written prior to the conduct of&#xD;
      any comparative analysis of the treatment arms. The primary analysis will be intention to&#xD;
      treat and will compare the two groups of patients in terms of their primary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test scores will be summarised using descriptive statistics, means with 95% confidence&#xD;
      intervals (or medians with inter-quartile ranges if non-normally distributed) at baseline, 12&#xD;
      weeks and 6 months. Change from baseline at 12 weeks and at 6 months post treatment will be&#xD;
      presented. The hypothesis of no difference between the two treatment arms at 12 weeks and 6&#xD;
      months (separate analyses) will be tested using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), controlling&#xD;
      for baseline measurements . A p-value of 0.05 (5% level) will be used to declare statistical&#xD;
      significance and 95% confidence intervals of the estimated effects will be reported. Time by&#xD;
      treatment interaction will be assessed. The assumptions that are made when using ANCOVA will&#xD;
      be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All longitudinal data collected will be used in a secondary analysis, with a resulting&#xD;
      increase in power. A formal test of a treatment-covariate interaction will be conducted.&#xD;
      Exploratory analysis will be conducted as to the impact on any treatment effect of other&#xD;
      factors such as gender.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As much information as possible will be collected about the reasons for missing outcome data&#xD;
      and this will be used to inform any imputation approaches employed in the analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Process Patients will be referred by all healthcare professionals at Southport&#xD;
      NHS Trust; the ASN will also visit the Emergency Department and Medical Assessment Unit daily&#xD;
      to identify cases. The nurse taking consent from the patient will discuss with the patients&#xD;
      named nurse if they agree that the patient is physically and mentally fit to give consent to&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient gives consent, they will undergo a full alcohol history and assessment. Those&#xD;
      patients not wishing to take part of the study, or those unwilling to consent to&#xD;
      randomisation will be given usual clinical care, and may be asked to consider consent for&#xD;
      Part B of the study. (refer to Part B of this protocol) Consecutive patients will be screened&#xD;
      for alcohol misuse on attendance at the ED department of Southport Hospital, on&#xD;
      identification of an alcohol-related problem the clinician will refer to the ASN for further&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent All eligible patients will be given relevant verbal and written information about the&#xD;
      research and asked to consent. Due to the opportunist nature and design of the study patients&#xD;
      will be asked to consent on initial assessment. This is to ensure that the population&#xD;
      recruited are representative of the clinical population attending ED either aware or unaware&#xD;
      of the role of alcohol in their presentation. Patients will be able to withdraw from the&#xD;
      study at any point. If reasons for opting out are volunteered by the patient we will ask&#xD;
      consent to use this information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Procedure On consent patients will be randomized to either the intervention or&#xD;
      control group. Patients will be randomized using sequentially numbered opaque sealed&#xD;
      envelopes prepared according to a computer-generated randomisation allocation sequence.&#xD;
      Blocked randomisation using randomly varying block sizes (prepared using Stata version 8.2)&#xD;
      will ensure equal numbers of patients are recruited into each group. Randomisation services&#xD;
      will be provided by an independent statistician at the Centre for Medical Statistics and&#xD;
      Health Evaluation, University of Liverpool, and the trial will be run from Southport General&#xD;
      Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Process Following consent, the research nurse will complete the screening and diagnostic&#xD;
      tools; a) Severity of Alcohol Dependence Questionnaire (SADQ), b) Leeds Dependency&#xD;
      Questionnaire c) Readiness to Change Questionnaire (RTCQ), and d) EuroQoL EQ-5D. The patient&#xD;
      will then be randomized to treatment group by the research nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1. Treatment Group Patients will receive an initial assessment and EBI from the ASN.&#xD;
      The Intervention will be delivered utilising the FRAMES approach [11] (Figure 2). The most&#xD;
      important element of this model is the exploration of patients' perceptions as to the link&#xD;
      between their alcohol consumption and presentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A maximum of six treatment sessions, lasting 20 minutes each, will take place within the 12&#xD;
      week treatment period (2 hours in total). Follow-up visits will be scheduled 12 weeks and 6&#xD;
      months following recruitment into the study, and will be performed in the outpatients&#xD;
      department, at home or by telephone. The assessor will be blinded to treatment allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients differ in whether they are completing a pharmacological detoxification or have opted&#xD;
      for an alcohol reduction strategy utilising tools such as a drink diary. For patients&#xD;
      undergoing pharmacological detoxification abstinence is essential and non-negotiable. Within&#xD;
      the FRAMES model patients have a choice of treatment modes and aims. Patients are offered&#xD;
      up-to 6 interventions. Assessment and brief intervention takes place on each occasion,&#xD;
      however biochemical assessment takes place only on clinical necessity (for example when a&#xD;
      change in clinical condition indicates).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2. Control Group The control group will receive the same assessments as the&#xD;
      intervention group but they will not receive the EBI. They will receive normal clinical care,&#xD;
      which may or may not include referral to a specialist alcohol service. Follow up visits will&#xD;
      be arranged 12 weeks and 6 months following recruitment into the study, either in&#xD;
      outpatients, at home or by telephone. The assessor will be blinded to treatment allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management Data will be collected prospectively at time points specified;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 12 week when treatment has finished&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 6 months follow up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from the Case Report Form (CRF) which will carry only an anonymised number, will be&#xD;
      entered directly on to an Microsoft access database held on a password protected networked&#xD;
      computer at Southport General Hospital. Patient information will be kept on a patient log,&#xD;
      which will remain in a locked filing cabinet in a clinical room at Southport General Hospital&#xD;
      alongside the anonymised case report files.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow Up Strategy&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A 48% failure to attend for follow up has been included in our power calculation to&#xD;
           account for the drop-out rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. An intention to treat analysis will be performed on all data&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Care will be taken to take address and phone details of the patient and off another&#xD;
           contact person.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Consent will be sought to contact the patients General Practitioner (GP) as a form of&#xD;
           contact. Therefore GP details and phone number will be taken down.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patients will be offered a range of follow-up options either in the hospital, on the&#xD;
           telephone, or at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. 2 weeks before follow up is due the patient will be contacted by the nurse or trial&#xD;
           co-ordinator to see if they will be attending their appointment and where they would&#xD;
           prefer this appointment to take place.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. The day before their appointment they will be contacted as a reminder that their&#xD;
           follow-up appointment is the next day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. If the patient is unable to be contacted they will be sent a letter asking them to&#xD;
           contact the team in order to arrange follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. If the patient is unable to be contacted via telephone or fails to respond to a letter&#xD;
           for the 6 month follow-up appointment, the research nurse will visit the patients home&#xD;
           to determine a) if the patient still resides at that address, and b) if the patient is&#xD;
           still willing to undertake a follow-up appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. If the patient cannot be contacted by the team at this stage, they will be said to be&#xD;
           lost to follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Protection will be in accordance with Southport and Ormskirk policies for data&#xD;
      governance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Consideration&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each group will receive normal clinical care in their respective groups. No patient group&#xD;
      will be disadvantaged as clinical care in these patients varies, and we do not know which the&#xD;
      most effective treatment is.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B. Patient Satisfaction with the Service&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims This part of the research is designed to capture the patient's experience. It adopts a&#xD;
      qualitative design and will focus on gaining the patient's views on three main features of&#xD;
      the study; a) of being screened for alcohol-related problems, b) of being invited to take&#xD;
      part in a treatment programme, c) subsequent participation in the RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all groups, consent for interviews will take place on initial assessment, and all groups&#xD;
      will be given a semi structured questionnaire. Group 2 and 3 patients, will also undergo a&#xD;
      face to face interview. Group 3 patients, will be interviewed again at the end of the&#xD;
      intervention phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative semi-structured questionnaires and in-depth face to face interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this part of the research is to provide an in-depth analysis of the views of&#xD;
      the patients approached to take part in this study. The study will therefore use qualitative&#xD;
      interviews to provide a deeper, contextualised understanding of the patient's experience of&#xD;
      taking part in this study and more particularly of the opportunistic nature by which they&#xD;
      will have their drinking assessed and of their participation in the RCT. Data will be&#xD;
      collected using two methods. 1) Semi structured questionnaires. 2) In-depth interviews&#xD;
      utilising a Topic Guide. The topic guide will be designed to elicit information on the&#xD;
      following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The experience of the opportunistic nature of the screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The experience of being offered and receiving a brief intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The experience of being identified as alcohol dependent without being included in the&#xD;
           intervention arm of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be required to sign informed consent prior to interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      The three sample groups will be defined as;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1. Eligible for intervention but not consenting to RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2. Eligible for intervention consenting to RCT and randomised to control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 3. Eligible for intervention consenting to RCT and randomised to intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient's known to be intravenous drug abusers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients unable to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients whose medical co-morbidity requires frequent or long term hospital admission.&#xD;
           These will include patients who are/have&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Comatose /unconscious&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. End Stage Chronic Liver Disease&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Dementia&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Congestive Cardiac Failure stage III or IV&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Acute Pancreatitis&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Head Injury with abnormalities on CT scan&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. Cerebral Vascular Accident (CVA)&#xD;
&#xD;
             8. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)&#xD;
&#xD;
             9. Other chronic conditions where an admission of 1 month or more is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patients known to be pregnant&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patient's presently recruited to any other research trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size It is estimated that approximately 10 patients in each group will be sufficient&#xD;
      to reach thematic saturation as described by Morse&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Process (See flow diagram Fig 4) The ASN will ask all patients irrespective of&#xD;
      their study involvement whether they are willing to speak to a qualitative researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient is willing the patient will be seen by the researcher following their clinical&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The qualitative researcher will determine the patient group for this part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1. Eligible for intervention but not consenting to RCT. Patients will be asked to&#xD;
      complete the PEQ. Those completing the PEQ will be asked to consent to a face to face&#xD;
      interview. At a time and place convenient to the patient the QR will conduct a face to face&#xD;
      interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2. Eligible for intervention consenting to RCT and randomised to control. The QR will&#xD;
      obtain informed written consent to conduct an interview. At a time and place convenient to&#xD;
      the patient, and as soon as possible after consent to the study is given, the QR will conduct&#xD;
      a face to face interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3. Eligible for intervention consenting to RCT and randomised to intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The QR will obtain informed written consent to conduct an interview. At a time and place&#xD;
      convenient to the patient, and as soon as possible after treatment is completed, the QR will&#xD;
      conduct a face to face interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis The identification of themes and patterns in the interview data, using such&#xD;
      techniques as constant comparative and deviant case analysis will be the predominant method&#xD;
      of organizing, coding and categorizing the data. While the constant comparative method is&#xD;
      associated with the principles of grounded theory, comparison represents a central analytic&#xD;
      process in inductive qualitative analysis that seeks to derive concepts from data. In&#xD;
      analysis the researcher is as interested in 'negative', 'deviant' or 'anomalous' evidence as&#xD;
      the identification of patterns of response. In this sort of analysis divergence provides an&#xD;
      important way of informing and modifying emergent conceptualisations and explanation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Where necessary, NVivo, computer assisted qualitative data analysis software that stores and&#xD;
      retrieves data will be used. Essentially NVivo software enables the data from the interview&#xD;
      transcripts to be directly imported from Word files into NVivo as rich text files and coded&#xD;
      according to description and meaning into 'nodes.&#xD;

      An economic evaluation of the EBI will be performed. The major part of this will be simple&#xD;
      comparison of costs in the two arms, measuring the costs of providing the services against&#xD;
      any differences in NHS costs between the two arms which might occur as a result of decreased&#xD;
      use of all other services, e.g. hospital re-attendances, accidents, GP visits etc regardless&#xD;
      of their relationship to the abuse of alcohol. Data will be collected from patient GP&#xD;
      records. The perspective will be limited to that of the NHS. The time frame will be over the&#xD;
      six months follow-up time of the study. The costs of the intervention will be as identified&#xD;
      in the study. The costs of the use of NHS services (ED or GP attendances cost per bed day as&#xD;
      an inpatient) will be taken from standard NHS costs published by the University of Kent. The&#xD;
      total costs of NHS care for each patient will be based on these costs and on the amount of&#xD;
      service utilisation data collected as outlined above. It may be necessary to adjust the&#xD;
      analysis if there are differences in baseline SADQ or in co-morbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A separate analysis of NHS costs specifically for alcohol related services will need to be&#xD;
      undertaken: although it might be anticipated that all NHS costs will fall in the intervention&#xD;
      arm, this cannot be assumed at this point and a fall in NHS services use may only be seen in&#xD;
      alcohol related areas, especially in-patients with severe co-morbidities. Whether a&#xD;
      particular NHS intervention is related to alcohol or to other cause will require judgment, to&#xD;
      be made by two clinical assessors who are blind to the patient allocation. Conversely, a fall&#xD;
      in total costs might be due to the play of chance resulting in a decrease in non-alcohol&#xD;
      related morbidities over the relatively short time frame of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the costs (especially total costs but also alcohol only related costs, provided that non&#xD;
      alcohol related costs are equal) in the intervention arm are less than in the&#xD;
      non-intervention arm, then the economic case for the intervention is made. If the costs in&#xD;
      the intervention arm are greater than in the non-intervention arm, it is necessary to&#xD;
      undertake a cost effectiveness study, with the same time frame and perspective.&#xD;
