  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psychosocial treatments for drug abuse benefit some patients (Rawson et al 2004), but there&#xD;
      is an urgent need for new treatment approaches that can improve treatment outcomes. One new&#xD;
      approach involves facilitation of extinction of conditioned responses through the use of&#xD;
      d-cycloserine, a partial agonist at the NMDA glycine site. This approach has proved useful&#xD;
      for the treatment of several anxiety disorders. For example, treatment with d-cycloserine&#xD;
      enhanced the efficacy of behavioral treatments for acrophobia (Ressler et al 2004) and social&#xD;
      phobia (Hofmann et al 2006) by enhancing extinction of conditioned fear responses. This&#xD;
      suggests that d-cycloserine has potential to enhance the efficacy of behavioral treatments&#xD;
      for drug dependence by enhancing extinction of conditioned responses to drug cues. In this&#xD;
      Phase I Cutting-Edge Basic Research Awards (CEBRA) application we propose a proof-of-concept&#xD;
      study to examine effects of treatment with d-cycloserine for facilitating extinction of&#xD;
      craving provoked by exposure to cigarette smoking cues. The benefits of this treatment&#xD;
      approach together with cognitive behavioral treatment for reducing cigarette smoking will&#xD;
      then be determined. Smoking cues will be presented using an established virtual reality&#xD;
      simulator(Bordnick et al 2004; Bordnick et al 2005a)&#xD;

    <description>The study will evaluate the effects of treatment with d-cycloserine (50mg administered prior to each exposure treatment) or placebo (n=20 per cell), on the efficacy exposure therapy using a virtual reality cue for smoking cessation when combined with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Craving ratings will be assessed using standard questionnaires, which will be completed prior to and following virtual reality cue exposure. Smoking cessation and cocaine use will be assessed at three follow-up visits.</description>
