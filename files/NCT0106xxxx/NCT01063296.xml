  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervical cancer is a major health problem for Chinese women. It is estimated that nearly&#xD;
      100,000 new cervical cancer cases occur in China every year, which accounts for about 20&#xD;
      percent of global new cases. Surgery and radiotherapy are two major radical treatment methods&#xD;
      for IB-IIB cervical cancer. Unlike the United States and some other countries, most of&#xD;
      operable women with IB-IIB cervical cancer received radical surgery other than radiotherapy&#xD;
      in China. Patients with recurrence risk factors (lymph node metastasis, deep stromal&#xD;
      invasion, positive lymphatic vascular space, et al. ) also received adjuvant therapy after&#xD;
      surgery, such as radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy that are recommended in the NCCN&#xD;
      guidelines. However, in China a substantial part of patients especially those admitted to&#xD;
      tertiary hospitals received several courses of chemotherapy instead of radiotherapy if they&#xD;
      had recurrence risk factors .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our previous study, we found that patients with intermediate risk factors (deep stromal&#xD;
      invasion, positive lymphatic vascular space, bulky tumor&gt;4cm) had better disease-free&#xD;
      survival and recurrence-free survival when they received chemotherapy compared with&#xD;
      radiotherapy. The objective in this study is to investigate whether the advantage of&#xD;
      postoperative chemotherapy is a result of circulating tumor cells (CTC) in some of the&#xD;
      patients with intermediate risk factors.&#xD;
