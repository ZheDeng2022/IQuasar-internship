      This open-label, non-randomized, dose escalation phase I biomarker trial of the triplet&#xD;
      regimen of AMG 479, everolimus, and panitumumab for subjects with refractory advanced solid&#xD;
      tumors is designed to assess the safety and tolerability of this combination as well as&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find the safest dose of the drugs AMG 479 and everolimus in&#xD;
      combination and then with panitumumab added. This study will consist of two parts. If you are&#xD;
      enrolled in Part One of the study, you will receive AMG 479 and everolimus. If you are&#xD;
      enrolled in Part Two of the study, you will receive AMG 479, everolimus, and panitumumab. The&#xD;
      study will also look at how the drugs work in the body, and will see if there is any effect&#xD;
      on your cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will have two parts: The first part will be to define the MTD/RPTD of the doublet&#xD;
      combination of AMG 479 + everolimus using a standard 3-6 subjects per dose level. Since each&#xD;
      agent is known to be well tolerated as monotherapy, we will start with the full dose of AMG&#xD;
      479 and escalate the dose of everolimus. Once the RPTD is established, an additional 20&#xD;
      subjects will be added to confirm the tolerability of this regimen and to allow more detailed&#xD;
      biomarker assessment for the effect of each agent alone in the doublet combination. In this&#xD;
      biomarker expanded cohort, subjects will start treatment with 2 weeks of AMG 479 monotherapy&#xD;
      (a single dose of AMG 479), followed by the combination of AMG 479 + everolimus on day 15.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second part of the study will assess tolerability of the triplet therapy, with&#xD;
      panitumumab added to the RPTD of AMG 479 + everolimus, again using a standard cohort size of&#xD;
      3-6 subjects. Finally, at the recommended phase II dose of the triplet therapy, 20 subjects&#xD;
      will be added to an expanded safety and biomarker cohort. In this biomarker expanded cohort,&#xD;
      10 subjects will start treatment with two weeks of AMG 479 monotherapy (a single dose of AMG&#xD;
      479), and 10 subjects will start treatment with two weeks of everolimus monotherapy, with all&#xD;
      subjects starting the triplet combination therapy with panitumumab on day 15.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two sustained complete responses (one &gt; 2 years of complete response, second &gt;8 months of&#xD;
      complete response) were seen in subjects with refractory NSCLC (never smokers) enrolled in&#xD;
      the doublet regimen. Therefore, an additional 20 subjects with NSCLC, never smokers or&#xD;
      non-smokers with ≤ 10 year pack smoking history will be enrolled at MTD/RPTD to further&#xD;
      assess safety, tolerability and clinical activity in this specific patient cohort. In this&#xD;
      cohort, subjects will start both drugs on cycle 1, day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ABOUT THE STUDY DRUGS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      AMG 479 is an intravenous (I.V., meaning through a vein) medication made from a special type&#xD;
      of human protein called antibodies. AMG 479 blocks the activity of another protein called&#xD;
      IGF-1R which is important for tumors to grow. Blocking IGFR-1 activity has been shown to slow&#xD;
      or kill cancer cells in laboratory studies. AMG 479 is currently being evaluated in clinical&#xD;
      research studies in a variety of cancers. AMG 479 is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) for the treatment of cancer and is therefore considered an&#xD;
      investigational drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Everolimus is a pill that works by blocking the activity of a substance in the body known as&#xD;
      mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin). mTOR is important for helping the growth and survival&#xD;
      in normal and cancer cells. Blocking mTOR activity has been shown to slow or kill cancer&#xD;
      cells in laboratory studies. Everolimus is currently being evaluated in clinical research&#xD;
      studies in a variety of cancers. Everolimus (AfinitorTM) is approved by the FDA for the&#xD;
      treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (kidney cancer), subependymal giant cell&#xD;
      astrocytoma (a type of brain cancer), neuroendocrine tumors originating in the lung or&#xD;
      gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and HER2-negative breast cancer. Besides cancer, everolimus also&#xD;
      has been tested for its ability to help block the rejection of solid organs transplants (such&#xD;
      as liver or kidney transplants). Everolimus is approved for this purpose in Europe but not in&#xD;
      the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Panitumumab is another intravenous (I.V.) medication made from a special type of human&#xD;
      protein called antibodies. Panitumumab blocks the activity of a protein called EGFr which is&#xD;
      also important for tumors to grow. Blocking EGFr activity has been shown to slow or kill&#xD;
      cancer cells in laboratory studies. Panitumumab is currently being evaluated in clinical&#xD;
      research studies in a variety of cancers. Panitumumab (Vectibix™) is approved by the FDA for&#xD;
      the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer following 5'FU, oxaliplatin and irinotecan&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimens.&#xD;

             participation and 6 months after the last dose of study drug. Should a woman become&#xD;
             pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner are participating in this&#xD;
             study, she should inform her treating physician and study PI immediately. Oral,&#xD;
             implantable, or injectable contraceptives may be affected by cytochrome P450&#xD;
             interactions, and are therefore not considered effective for this study. )&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical, psychiatric or social conditions&#xD;
             that could compromise the safety or compliance of treatment as so judged by treating&#xD;
