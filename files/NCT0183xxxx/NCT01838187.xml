  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently there is no known effective treatment for patients with advanced stage&#xD;
      neuroblastoma who have relapsed or not responded to standard therapy. There is also no known&#xD;
      effective treatment for patients with pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma who are less than 12&#xD;
      years of age. In previous studies that used 131I-MIBG as a potential anti-cancer therapy, a&#xD;
      decrease in the size of tumors was seen in some of the children and adults. This research&#xD;
      study will continue to evaluate the side effects of 131I-MIBG +/- Vorinostat when treating&#xD;
      children and adults with neuroblastoma, pheochromocytoma, or paraganglioma. The 131I-MIBG&#xD;
      compound is intended to work by selectively delivering the radioactive iodine to the tumor&#xD;
      cells, which is then intended to result in their destruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Make 131I-MIBG therapy available to patients with advanced neuroblastoma,&#xD;
           pheochromocytoma, or paraganglioma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Further assess the side effects of 131I-MIBG therapy&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuroblastoma, pheochromocytoma, and paraganglioma remain fatal diseases for a large&#xD;
      percentage of patients, especially those with high-risk disease features who become resistant&#xD;
      to conventional therapy. 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (131I-MIBG) is a norepinephrine analog&#xD;
      that concentrates in adrenergic tissue and has been shown to be sensitive and specific for&#xD;
      detecting localized and metastatic neuroblastoma, pheochromocytoma, and paraganglioma. More&#xD;
      importantly, experience of many institutions has proven that this agent used as a targeted&#xD;
      radiotherapeutic has significant anti-tumor activity against refractory neuroblastoma 1-7 as&#xD;
      well as pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma. Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, UCSF, and&#xD;
      the University of Michigan have just completed a large Phase 2 study of 131I-MIBG given in&#xD;
      doses of 10-18 mCi/kg with stem cell rescue, if necessary, and have shown that this agent is&#xD;
      safe and effective palliative therapy for refractory or relapsed neuroblastoma patients. In&#xD;
      addition, there is growing evidence that low-dose (5-10 mCi/kg) submyeloablative MIBG therapy&#xD;
      is both safe and effective for disease palliation. In addition, a recently published&#xD;
      randomized phase 2 trial in patients with relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma showed that the&#xD;
      combination of vorinostat/MIBG had a higher response rate than 131I-MIBG alone, with&#xD;
      manageable toxicity. This protocol therefore provides a mechanism to deliver this therapy&#xD;
      when clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide palliative therapy with MIBG + vorinostat for patients with advanced&#xD;
           neuroblastoma who can take vorinostat&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide palliative therapy with MIBG without vorinostat for patients with advanced&#xD;
           neuroblastoma who cannot take vorinostat, and those with pheochromocytoma, or&#xD;
           paraganglioma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gain more information about acute and late toxicity of 131I-MIBG therapy +/- vorinostat&#xD;
           for patients with refractory neuroblastoma, and 131I-MIBG therapy alone for those with&#xD;
           pheochromocytoma, or paraganglioma&#xD;
