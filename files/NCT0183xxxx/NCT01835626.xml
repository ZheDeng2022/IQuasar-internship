  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery are standard treatments for basal cell carcinoma&#xD;
      at most institutions. The purpose of this study is to determine whether adding vismodegib to&#xD;
      radiation (chemoradiotherapy) is safe and tolerable. The purpose of this study is to assess&#xD;
      the safety and tolerability of combined radiation therapy and vismodegib. This combination&#xD;
      may increase the chances of the tumors being destroyed or unable to spread to other parts of&#xD;
      the body in people with locally advanced basal cell carcinoma of the head and neck.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, multi-center Phase II clinical trial to assess the safety and&#xD;
      demonstrate the efficacy of a combined modality approach using radiation therapy after&#xD;
      induction and concurrently with systemic administration of vismodegib, which may increase the&#xD;
      rates of complete response and sustained local control in patients with locally advanced&#xD;
      Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with locally advanced BCC of the head and neck, consisting of at least one&#xD;
             histologically or cytologically confirmed lesion greater than or equal to 20 mm in&#xD;
             longest diameter that is considered to be inoperable or to have a medical&#xD;
             contraindication to surgery, in the opinion of a Mohs dermatologic surgeon, head and&#xD;
             neck surgeon, or plastic surgeon. Locally advanced disease is considered to include&#xD;
             involved lymph nodes of the neck. A patient with regionally involved lymph nodes in&#xD;
             the neck is considered eligible. The patient should be considered a candidate for&#xD;
             radiotherapy and should not have medical contraindications to receipt of radiation&#xD;
             therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             If a patient has distant metastatic spread of BCC (e.g., spread to distant areas&#xD;
             outside the regional lymph nodes, clearly non contiguous areas of bone involvement, or&#xD;
             distant metastasis to lung, brain, or other visceral organs), the patient should be&#xD;
             considered as having distant metastasis and is not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: All lesions that the investigator proposes to follow as target lesions during&#xD;
             the course of the study must have previously been histologically confirmed as BCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Acceptable contraindications to surgery include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  BCC that has recurred in the same location after two or more surgical procedures&#xD;
                  and successful curative resection is deemed unlikely&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Complete surgical resection is not possible or is deemed excessively morbid (e.g.&#xD;
                  invasion into cranial nerves or skull base, proximity to brain, spinal canal, or&#xD;
                  orbit)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Anticipated substantial morbidity and/or major deformity from surgery (e.g.&#xD;
                  removal of a major facial structure, such as nose, ear, eyelid, eye, or jaw; or&#xD;
                  requirement for upper limb amputation)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Medical contraindication to surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patient refusal of surgery due to anticipated morbidity&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Other conditions considered to be contraindicating must be discussed with Data&#xD;
                  Coordinator before enrolling the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Prior radiation therapy is acceptable but there cannot be major overlap of the&#xD;
             previously irradiated tissues with the new radiation treatment volumes anticipated to&#xD;
             be delivered for the purposes of this protocol, in such a way that curative intent&#xD;
             with radiation cannot be met. Furthermore, the total dose from all radiation delivered&#xD;
             and expected to be delivered should not exceed the suggested dose constraints given&#xD;
             for normal structures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Zubrod Performance Status 0-2&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Age of greater than or equal to 18 years&#xD;

             limit of normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) /serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase&#xD;
             (SGPT): &lt; 3 X institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
             Adequate renal function:&#xD;
&#xD;
             creatinine: within normal institutional limits OR creatinine clearance: &gt; 60&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. For male patients, agreement not to donate sperm during the study and for 3 months&#xD;
             after the final dose of vismodegib. Male patients must use condoms at all times, even&#xD;
             after a vasectomy, during sexual intercourse with pregnant partners or female partners&#xD;
             of reproductive potential during treatment with vismodegib. Vismodegib is present in&#xD;
             semen. It is not known if the amount of vismodegib in semen can cause embryo-fetal&#xD;
             harm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential within 7 days prior&#xD;
             to initiating vismodegib. For women of childbearing potential, a negative pregnancy&#xD;
             test within 7 days prior to commencement of dosing is required. Women of reproductive&#xD;
             potential are required to use two forms of acceptable contraception (including one&#xD;
             acceptable barrier method with spermicide) during therapy and for 7 months after&#xD;
             completing therapy. Acceptable forms of primary contraception include the following:&#xD;
             Combination hormonal contraceptives, subcutaneous hormonal implant, hormonal patch,&#xD;
             hormonal contraceptives (levonorgestre-releasing intrauterine system,&#xD;
             medroxyprogesterone acetate depot), tubal sterilization, vasectomy, and intrauterine&#xD;
             device (IUD). Acceptable forms of barrier contraception include the following: any&#xD;
             male condom (with spermicide) or diaphragm (with spermicide).&#xD;

             lymph nodes, clearly non contiguous areas of bone involvement, or distant metastasis&#xD;
             to lung, brain, liver or other visceral organs) are ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with nevoid BCC syndrome (Gorlin syndrome) should not enroll in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. A patient with a known other malignancy is eligible if there is a negligible risk for&#xD;
             disease progression or death within one year, there is no active ongoing treatment for&#xD;
             this malignancy, and the malignancy and/or any anticipated future treatments would not&#xD;
             interfere with protocol-mandated evaluations at 1 year.&#xD;

&#xD;
          8. Inability or unwillingness to swallow capsules; Patients with any condition that may&#xD;
             impair the ability to swallow or absorb oral medications/investigational product&#xD;
             including:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  any lesion, whether induced by tumor, radiation or other conditions, which makes&#xD;

&#xD;
             Note: If an area including one or more lesions is definable for radiation therapy&#xD;
             targeting, the patient may be eligible for treatment on study using the designated&#xD;
             target lesion(s) identified by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;

          <description>150mg Vismodegib will be taken once a day, daily. Radiation therapy will be started after the patient has completed taking vismodegib for 12 weeks. The patient will take daily vismodegib through the completion of radiation therapy. The patient will receive radiation once a day, Monday through Friday, for 7 weeks. Each radiation treatment may take up to 30 minutes. After 12 weeks, they will be evaluated again to make sure they are still eligible to participate in the study. If they are eligible to continue, they will continue taking vismodeib daily as before for another 7 weeks while they receive radiation therapy.</description>
