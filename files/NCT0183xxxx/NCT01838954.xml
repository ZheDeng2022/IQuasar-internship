  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to constant strain the joints of the hands are frequently affected by osteoarthritis&#xD;
      (OA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Short-wave diathermy (SWD) is a form of electromagnetic therapy, which causes movement of&#xD;
      ions, distortion of molecules, and creation of eddy currents and as a result heat is produced&#xD;
      in deep tissue. Its claimed mechanism of action includes inducing an anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      response, reducing joint stiffness, stimulating connective tissue repair, and reducing muscle&#xD;
      spasm and pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the available studies were performed to study the large weight-bearing joints only,&#xD;
      there is a lack in scientific evidence for the efficacy of SWD in hand OA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study is to evaluate the effect&#xD;
      of SWD on:&#xD;
&#xD;
      joint function in patients with hand OA. joint pain in patients with hand OA. grip strength&#xD;
      in patients with hand OA. quality of live in patients with hand OA.&#xD;
