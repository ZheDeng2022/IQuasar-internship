  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One out of every six men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer and post prostatectomy up to&#xD;
      75% report urinary incontinence. There are many hypotheses about the exact cause of post&#xD;
      prostatectomy stress incontinence (PPI). Existing studies have focused on surgical or&#xD;
      cadaveric dissections to define structures responsible for PPI. Contemporary 3T MRI now&#xD;
      allows three dimensional, sub-millimeter resolution of the human pelvis and clearly&#xD;
      demonstrates pelvic anatomy without the distortion of dissection. It is our overarching&#xD;
      hypothesis that PPI is multifactorial and occurs because of a combination of specific&#xD;
      anatomical and functional impairments. We propose conducting a case control study with&#xD;
      matching for age and race to compare the MRI anatomy and urinary tract function on&#xD;
      urodynamics between 20 men with PPI (cases) and 20 men who are continent post prostatectomy&#xD;
      (controls) who are all a minimum of 12 months post surgery. We will use static and dynamic&#xD;
      MRI at 3 Tesla to make objective measurements of the bladder neck, external urethral&#xD;
      sphincter, pelvic floor, urethral anastomotic fibrosis, and urethral hypermobility- all&#xD;
      believed to play a large part in continence. Multi-channel urodynamic studies will also be&#xD;
      performed to assess the leak point and maximum urethral closure pressure. All cases and&#xD;
      controls will complete standardized questionnaires - the AUA symptom index and the&#xD;
      Incontinence Severity Index as a quality of life measure. This study is needed to provide&#xD;
      critical information about causes of male PPI, a quality of life altering voiding&#xD;
      dysfunction, and will assist with the advancement of pharmacological and surgical treatment&#xD;
      of this disease.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Only men will be included since this is a study of post prostatectomy incontinence.&#xD;
             Cases will be comprised of men who are post radical retropubic or laparoscopic&#xD;
             (robotic) prostatectomy who have stress urinary incontinence based on history and a&#xD;
             minimum of 50 grams of urine loss on 24 hour pad weights. Controls will be comprised&#xD;
             of men who are post radical retropubic or laparoscopic (robotic) prostatectomy who do&#xD;
             not have any kind or amount of incontinence based on history. Cases and controls will&#xD;
             be matched for both age and race these have been shown to alter anatomical appearance&#xD;
             of structures and lower urinary tract function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Criteria for both groups include urge incontinence, urinary retention, neurologic&#xD;
             disease, insulin dependent diabetes, high dose steroid use, pre-surgical abnormal&#xD;
             voiding function or incontinence, prior pelvic radiation or urologic surgery, any&#xD;
             prior incontinence surgery, current medical therapy for incontinence or a perineal&#xD;
             route of radical prostatectomy since this had been shown to give a distinctly&#xD;
             different appearance on MRI compared to the laparoscopic or retropubic approach. Any&#xD;
             patient with pelvic or systemic recurrence of their prostate cancer will also be&#xD;
             excluded. Any man with relative or absolute contraindications to MRI such as implants&#xD;
             or claustrophobia will be excluded.&#xD;
