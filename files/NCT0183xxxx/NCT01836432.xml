  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Unfortunately, despite the best clinical efforts and breakthroughs in biotechnology, most&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer continue to die from the rapid progression of their&#xD;
      disease. One primary reason for this is that the disease is typically without symptoms until&#xD;
      significant local and/or distant spread has occurred and is often beyond the chance for cure&#xD;
      at the time of the diagnosis. The lack of any treatment to substantially increase long term&#xD;
      survival rates is reflected by the poor outcomes associated with this disease, specifically&#xD;
      time to disease progression and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, another important part of the body is now being looked at as a target for therapy&#xD;
      against this disease - the immune system. Scientists have clearly shown that pancreatic tumor&#xD;
      cells produce a number of defective proteins, or express normal proteins in highly&#xD;
      uncharacteristic ways, as part of this cancer. In some cancers, these abnormalities can cause&#xD;
      an immune response to the cancer cells much in the way one responds to infected tissue. In&#xD;
      progressive cancers however, the immune system fails to effectively identify or respond to&#xD;
      these abnormalities and the cancer cells are not attacked or destroyed for reasons not yet&#xD;
      fully understood. This clinical trial proposes a new way to stimulate the immune system to&#xD;
      recognize pancreatic cancer cells and to stimulate an immune response that destroys or blocks&#xD;
      the growth of the cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This new method of treatment helps the immune system of pancreatic cancer patients to&#xD;
      &quot;identify&quot; the cancerous tissue so that it can be eliminated from the body. As an example,&#xD;
      most people are aware that patients with certain diseases may require an organ transplant to&#xD;
      replace a damaged kidney or heart. After receiving their transplant, these patients receive&#xD;
      special drugs because they are at great danger of having an immune response that destroys or&#xD;
      &quot;rejects&quot; the transplanted organ. This &quot;rejection&quot; occurs when their immune system responds&#xD;
      to differences between the cells of the transplanted organ and their own immune system by&#xD;
      attacking the foreign tissue in the same way as it would attack infected tissue. When the&#xD;
      differences between foreign tissues and the patient's body are even larger, as with the&#xD;
      differences between organs from different species, the rejection is very rapid, highly&#xD;
      destructive, and the immunity it generates is longlasting. This is called hyperacute&#xD;
      rejection and the medicine used to immunize patients in this protocol tries to harness this&#xD;
      response to teach a patient's immune system to fight their pancreatic cancer just as the body&#xD;
      would learn to reject a transplanted organ from an animal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To do this, Algenpantucel-L immunotherapy contains human pancreatic cancer cells that contain&#xD;
      a mouse gene that marks the cancer cells as foreign to patient's immune systems. The immune&#xD;
      system therefore attacks these cancer cells just as they would attack any truly foreign&#xD;
      tissue, destroying as much as it can. Additionally, the immune system is stimulated to&#xD;
      identify differences (aside from the mouse gene) between these cancer cells and normal human&#xD;
      tissue as foreign. This &quot;education&quot; of the immune system helps treat the patient because&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer cells already present in a treated patient are believed to show some of the&#xD;
      same differences from normal tissue as the modified pancreatic cancer cells in the product.&#xD;
      Due to these similarities, the immune system, once &quot;educated&quot; by the Algenpantucel-L&#xD;
      immunotherapy, identifies the patient's cancer as foreign and attacks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The chemotherapy combination to be used in this study has been shown to improve survival in&#xD;
      advanced pancreatic cancer and is being combined with an experimental pancreatic cancer&#xD;
      immunotherapy that stimulates the immune system to recognize and attack the cancer. One goal&#xD;
      of this study is to determine whether chemotherapy and immunotherapies can work cooperatively&#xD;
      to increase anti-tumor effects to levels beyond what would be seen with either treatment&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this experimental study, all patients are given a strong combination of anti-tumor&#xD;
      chemotherapies while some patients are also given injections of an immunotherapy drug&#xD;
      consisting of two types of pancreatic cancer cells that we have modified to make them more&#xD;
      easily recognized and attacked by the immune system. We propose to test this new treatment&#xD;
      protocol in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer to demonstrate that treatment&#xD;
      with the immunotherapy increases the time until the tumor progresses or increases overall&#xD;
      survival when given in combination with the current standard of care therapy for this&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;

      This protocol attempts to treat pancreatic cancer therapy using a naturally occurring barrier&#xD;
      to xenotransplantation in humans to increase the efficacy of immunizing patients against&#xD;
      their pancreatic cancer. In this protocol, the transfer of the murine α(1,3)&#xD;
      galactosyltransferase [α(1,3)GT] gene to immunotherapy component cells results in the cell&#xD;
      surface expression of α(1,3)galactosyl-epitopes (αgal) epitopes on membrane glycoproteins and&#xD;
      glycolipids. These epitopes are the major target of the hyperacute rejection response. This&#xD;
      response occurs when organs are transplanted from lower animal donor species into primates&#xD;
      and results in rapid destruction of transplanted tissue and an augmented response against&#xD;
      transplant antigens, including antigens not related to the αgal epitopes. Human hosts have&#xD;
      pre-existing anti-α-gal antibodies that are thought to result from chronic immunological&#xD;
      stimulation due to exposure to α-gal epitopes that are naturally expressed on normal gut&#xD;
      flora and these antibodies may comprise up to 1% of serum immunoglobulin G (IgG).&#xD;
      Opsonization and lysis of the immunotherapy component cells mediated by this antibody is&#xD;
      believed to increase the efficiency of antigen processing by targeting vaccine components to&#xD;
      antigen presenting cells via the Fcγ receptor.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients must have borderline resectable or locally advanced unresectable pancreatic&#xD;
             cancer with no metastatic spread as determined by a baseline diagnostic CT scan with&#xD;
             intravenous contrast (or MRI). CT should be performed according to a defined pancreas&#xD;
             protocol such as triphasic cross-sectional imaging with thin slices. Optimal&#xD;
             multi-phase technique including a non-contrast phase plus arterial, pancreatic&#xD;
             parenchymal and portal venous phase of contrast enhancement with thin cuts (3mm)&#xD;
             throughout the abdomen is preferred. Studies must be evaluated by a radiologist and/or&#xD;
             surgeon and deemed borderline resectable or locally advanced unresectable as defined&#xD;
             per the NCCN Practice Guidelines in Oncology V2.2012, as:&#xD;

&#xD;
               2. Venous involvement of the SMV/portal vein demonstrating tumor abutment with&#xD;
                  impingement and narrowing of the lumen, encasement of the SMV/portal vein but&#xD;
                  without encasement of the nearby arteries, or short-segment venous occlusion&#xD;

&#xD;
               3. Gastroduodenal artery encasement up to the hepatic artery with either short&#xD;
                  segment encasement or direct abutment of the hepatic artery without extension to&#xD;
                  the celiac axis.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Tumor abutment of the SMA not to exceed greater than 180 degrees of the&#xD;
