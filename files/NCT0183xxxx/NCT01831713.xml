  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Historically, transthoracic Doppler echocardiography has been unable to provide interpretable&#xD;
      data of blood flow within the lung parenchyma because of air attenuation of Doppler signals.&#xD;
      Recently, a transthoracic Doppler system known as the Sonara/tek Transcranial Doppler (TCD)&#xD;
      System has been developed that can identify parenchymal pulmonary blood flow (PPBF) signals.&#xD;
      The ability to non-invasively collect information regarding the pulmonary aspect of the&#xD;
      cardio-pulmonary system may provide valuable information and new insights into the structural&#xD;
      and functional characteristics of the lung parenchyma and vasculature in health and disease&#xD;
      states.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This new system was previously studied among 31 healthy volunteers and one subject with&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation.1 Pulsed spectral Doppler signals were obtained over the chest wall using&#xD;
      a signal processing and algorithm package in conjunction with a non-imaging Doppler device&#xD;
      coupled with an electrocardiogram. Clear reproducible lung Doppler signals (LDS) originating&#xD;
      from different elements and phases of cardiac activity that generate mechanical waves which&#xD;
      propagate throughout the lung were expressed in pulsatile changes in ultrasound reflections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the completion of the first 25 patients in our pilot study, we have received some&#xD;
      valuable information. After assessing patients with CHF and pulmonary hypertension, we&#xD;
      identified signals particular to the CHF group. There were unique features that were never&#xD;
      observed in the normal patients. On top of the regular Lung Doppler signals seen in normal&#xD;
      patients, high velocity &quot;disorganized&quot; variable signals that were not synchronous with the&#xD;
      heart beat, but rather sometimes with respiration were observed. We believe that the signals&#xD;
      may represent popping open of small bronchi surrounded by &quot;water filled&quot; parenchyma. These&#xD;
      events that generate very strong reflector like signals may represent the movement of fluid&#xD;
      at the blood vessel-alveolar air junction.&#xD;

                  admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  C. Non-CHF controls: patients without CHF and without any of the following:&#xD;
                  pulmonary hypertension, any known pulmonary disease, uncontrolled hypertension.&#xD;
