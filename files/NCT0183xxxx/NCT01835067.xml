  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will recruit patients who have recently had a submacular haemorrhage (bleed under&#xD;
      the part of the retina responsible for detailed vision), as a complication of wet age-related&#xD;
      macular degeneration (wet AMD). Wet AMD is a very common disease where abnormal blood vessels&#xD;
      form under the retina and leak, causing a significant reduction in vision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will investigate treatment of the bleed with various combinations of the two drugs:&#xD;
      tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) - designed to dissolve the blood clot; and&#xD;
      perfluoropropane (C3F8) - designed to shift the blood clot away from the central part of the&#xD;
      retina (the macula). tPA is a commonly used 'clot-buster' drug for the treatment of stroke.&#xD;
      C3F8 is a gas commonly used in eye surgery. Patients recruited will be divided into four&#xD;
      groups: control group that receive none of the above drugs; one group that receives only tPA;&#xD;
      one group that receives only C3F8; and one group that receives both.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive the current gold standard treatment for wet AMD, ranibizumab&#xD;
      (Lucentis®).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to improve vision in a condition, which left untreated, would cause&#xD;
      severe visual loss.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the commonest cause of blindness worldwide. Its&#xD;
      prevalence increases with age, being relatively rare under 60 years and reaching its peak&#xD;
      incidence in those older than 80 years. AMD principally affects central vision, which is&#xD;
      responsible for the ability to see fine detail and the disease rapidly destroys the ability&#xD;
      to read normal print, recognise faces, drive, and watch television. It can therefore have a&#xD;
      profound effect on quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two main forms of AMD; the dry form, in which there is slow degeneration of the&#xD;
      cells responsible for sight, resulting in gradual visual loss; and the wet form&#xD;
      (neovascular), which occurs when abnormal blood vessels (choroidal neovascularisation) grow&#xD;
      under the retina, the part of the eye which is responsible for sensing light, like the film&#xD;
      of a camera. These new blood vessels have weak walls leading to leakage of fluid (oedema),&#xD;
      and sometimes significant amounts of bleeding (submacular haemorrhage - SMH). These rapidly&#xD;
      lead to central visual distortion and blurring. Although the dry form is commoner, the wet&#xD;
      form more commonly results in profound central visual loss and is responsible for the&#xD;
      majority of cases that ultimately require blind registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current best treatment ('gold-standard') for wet AMD is the drug ranibizumab (Lucentis®),&#xD;
      which aims to shrink and destroy the abnormal blood vessels responsible for the visual&#xD;
      symptoms. In several trials ranibizumab has been shown to improve vision in patients with wet&#xD;
      AMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is not uncommon for patients with wet AMD to develop SMH, which when it occurs,&#xD;
      significantly reduces the patient's visual prognosis. SMH is thought to have a number of&#xD;
      toxic consequences on the retinal function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study investigates the use of two drugs: tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), a&#xD;
      'clot-buster' drug used to treat stroke, which is designed to dissolve the clot over the&#xD;
      central retina (macula); and perfluoropropane (C3F8), a gas commonly used in retinal surgery,&#xD;
      which is designed to displace the clot away from the macula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a randomized, double-masked, clinical trial with a recruitment target of 55&#xD;
      people with SMH and wet AMD. Participants will be allocated to one of four groups; a control&#xD;
      group receiving none of the above drugs; one group receiving only tPA; one group receiving&#xD;
      only C3F8; and one group receiving both. All patients will receive the 'gold-standard'&#xD;
      treatment of ranibizumab for their underlying wet AMD. We aim to determine if tPA and/or C3F8&#xD;
      produce a visual outcome that is superior to standard care, with a favourable safety profile.&#xD;
      We will also measure the size of the blood clot and scarring using computer analysis of&#xD;
      macula photographs.&#xD;
