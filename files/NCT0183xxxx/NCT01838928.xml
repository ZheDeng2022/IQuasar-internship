      Background: The use of ultrasound in regional anesthesia enables a reduction in the local&#xD;
      anesthetic volume. The present study aimed to determine the minimum effective concentration&#xD;
      (EC50 and EC95) of bupivacaine for axillary brachial plexus block (ABPB). Methods: Following&#xD;
      approval by the Research Ethics Committee, patients with a physical condition of I or II&#xD;
      according to the American Society of Anesthesiologists, between 21 and 65 years of age were&#xD;
      recruited and subjected to elective surgery of the hand and ABPB. The concentration of the&#xD;
      anesthetic was determined using a step-up/step-down method and was based on the outcome of&#xD;
      the preceding block.&#xD;

      The demographic data of all included patients were recorded. Routine monitoring of the&#xD;
      surgical procedure, including electrocardiography, non-invasive blood pressure and pulse&#xD;
      oximetry, was performed. Peripheral venous access was established in the nonoperative upper&#xD;
      limb and standard intravenous premedication (0.03 mgkg of midazolan) was administered to all&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brachial plexus blocks were performed through the axilla on patients in a supine position&#xD;
      using a ultrasound device with a 13-6 MHz linear transducer (SonoSite, Bothell, WA, USA) and&#xD;
      a Stimuplex速 DIG RC peripheral nerve stimulator (B. Braun, Melsung, Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The end of the local anesthetic injection was considered time 0 for evaluating the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the block. A blinded observer, who was not present during the injection and&#xD;
      was unaware of the concentration of local anesthetic used, assessed motor, thermal and&#xD;
      sensory blocks. These assessments were performed every 5 minutes after the procedure for 30&#xD;
      minutes or until the block was deemed effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motor function was assessed using a modified Bromage scale. The following muscles were&#xD;
      assessed: finger flexors (median nerve), finger extensors (radial nerve), finger adductors&#xD;
      (ulnar nerve) and elbow flexion (musculocutaneos nerve).The assessment of thermal sensation&#xD;
      in the upper limb was performed using gauze and alcohol. Pain sensation was assessed by a&#xD;
      pinprick test using a 23 G needle. The thermal and pain sensitivities of the ulnar, median,&#xD;
      radial and musculocutaneos were examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical anesthesia was defined as a motor scale of 2 or lower, with absent of appreciation&#xD;
      of cold and pinprick sensation. Patients who exhibited block failure received an&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided complement to the nerve block distal to axilla or conversion to general&#xD;
      anestehesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients received a subcutaneous injection of 3 mL of a 2% lidocaine solution with&#xD;
      epinephrine as a supplementary intercostobrachial block due to the use of a pneumatic&#xD;
      tourniquet on the middle third of the arm. During surgery, an infusion of 25-50&#xD;
      mcg.kg-1.min-1 of propofol was used to achieve proper sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative analgesia was assessed in the recovery room using a numeric pain rating scale&#xD;
      (0 indicating no pain, 10 indicating the worst pain ever experienced) and the amount of&#xD;
      analgesic used at four hours after the ABPB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the surgical procedure, the patients were admitted to the recovery room, where they&#xD;
      were monitored until they met the conditions for discharge into an outpatient regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the primary objective was to estimate the minimum effective concentration of a&#xD;
      5-mL bupivacaine solution without epinephrine for ultrasound-guided ABPB. Volume assignment&#xD;
      was carried out using a biased coin design up-and-down sequential method.The initial&#xD;
      concentration of local anesthetic was 0.35%. This dose was chosen based on our clinical&#xD;
      experience and statistical simulation at various doses. Each subsequent dose was based on the&#xD;
      response of the preceding subject, as per a biased-coin design up-down sequential method.6&#xD;
      The dosing changes were in increments of 0,05%. The anesthesia provider was blinded to the&#xD;
      concentration of bupivacaine, as was the subject. If a failure was observed in the previous&#xD;
      subject, the dose was stepped up in the next subject. If a success was observed, the next&#xD;
      subject was randomized with probability of 0.1 to the next lower dose and with probability of&#xD;
      0.9 to the same dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ED95 with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and estimated probabilities were calculated&#xD;
      using logistic regression with SAS software. A sample size of at least 40 patients was&#xD;
      selected after testing a variety of scenarios, each with simulations of both the responses&#xD;
      and the corresponding doses selected by the sequential allocation method described above, and&#xD;
      beginning with various starting doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The means and standard deviations were used to analyse parametric data, whereas medians and&#xD;
      quartiles were used to analyse non-parametric data.&#xD;
