  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are three major subtypes of breast cancer:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Hormone receptor positive (contain cells that express the estrogen receptor or&#xD;
           progesterone receptor).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Tumors that express the epidermal growth factor receptor gene ( HER-2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Triple negative (cancer cells that lack the hormone receptors and the epidermal growth&#xD;
           factor receptor gene HER-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While effective therapies exist for most cases of breast cancer at first occurrence, many&#xD;
      patients eventually exhibit disease that does not respond to all standard breast therapies,&#xD;
      particularly in the metastatic setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are therapies that are used to treat other types of cancers with genetic mutations that&#xD;
      are in the process of being evaluated for use in breast cancer. The current techniques used&#xD;
      for detecting mutations in the genes of breast cancer patients, which can be treated with&#xD;
      drugs specific for the genetic mutations, are invasive and identifying effective diagnostic&#xD;
      non-invasive procedures are the next challenge for physicians. This study will compare the&#xD;
      ability to detect genetic mutations samples from non-invasive procedures such as a blood&#xD;
      draw, to more invasive procedures such as tissue taken from a biopsy sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is also a concern with current techniques used to detect genetic mutations that cells&#xD;
      from a single tissue sample may not be representative of the types of cells present in all&#xD;
      the tumors in the body and therapies selected using a single tissue sample may not be&#xD;
      effective for all of the cancer in the body. This study will use blood drawn from&#xD;
      participants prior to any drug therapy and compare the genes from this blood to tissue&#xD;
      samples from multiple sites of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also compare the genetic profile of the metastatic tumors to the genetic&#xD;
      profile of the original breast cancer to determine if there are any changes in the genetics&#xD;
      of the tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants that have newly diagnosed metastatic disease will provide tissue from their&#xD;
      primary site of disease via an image guided biopsy. These participants will also provide&#xD;
      tissue from at least 2 other distant metastatic sites (lung, pleural/peritoneal, liver,&#xD;
      brain, or skin). Each biopsy procedure will attempt to obtain 2-3 samples for research&#xD;
      purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants that have locally recurrent disease in the breast will have the tissue from the&#xD;
      site of re-occurrence biopsied as well as two distant metastatic sites (lung,&#xD;
      pleural/peritoneal, liver, brain, or skin). Participants that have either multi-centric&#xD;
      disease or bilateral disease will have all tumors sampled with the intention of providing 2-3&#xD;
      samples/tumor for research purposes. Participants with multi-centric and bilateral disease&#xD;
      will also have 2 distant sites of distant disease sampled (lung, pleural/peritoneal, liver,&#xD;
      brain, or skin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to any scheduled biopsy procedures all participants will have a blood draw used to&#xD;
      examine the genetics of the tumor cells in the blood. The participants will have 8 tubes of&#xD;
      blood drawn for the test and then they will proceed onto the tissue sampling portion of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  3.1 Radiographic evidence of new or progressive metastatic breast cancer by CT&#xD;
             chest/abdomen/pelvis and bone scan, or by PET scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  3.2 Patient must have ≥3 sites of disease involving ≥2 organ sites appropriate for&#xD;
             biopsy. Treating physician, in consultation with interventional radiologist as needed,&#xD;
             will select sites for potential biopsy (see section 5.2.2 for guidance on evaluable&#xD;
             sites.)Histologic documentation of metastatic invasive breast cancer with metastasis&#xD;
             to a distant organ site (lung, liver, pleural/peritoneal, skin [if skin, must be&#xD;
             determined by treating physician that it is not skin involvement from breast primary&#xD;
             or local regional recurrence], and/or bone) by core needle or excisional biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  3.3 The subject must agree to undergo and be able to tolerate the research biopsy(ies)&#xD;
             and blood draw.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  3.4 Prior chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, or radiotherapy with therapeutic intent is&#xD;
             allowed in the metastatic setting. However, for patients currently receiving such&#xD;
             treatment(s), archived tumor specimens will not count towards the required biopsy of 3&#xD;
             tumors&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  3.5 Women or men &gt; age 18.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  3.6 Ability to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  3.7 Normal Prothrombin Time/International Normalized Ratio within 30 days of any&#xD;
             diagnostic biopsies, or if patient is on anticoagulation therapy, approval is required&#xD;
             by provider doing the biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  3.8 Negative pregnancy test or beyond reproductive potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  3.9 Medical evaluation by medical oncology within 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  3.10 Previous but not current smokers are eligible if they have not smoked for more&#xD;
             than 10 years and have less than 25 pk yr smoking history, see exclusion criterion&#xD;
             3.14.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        3.12 Poor venous access (unable to tolerate large-gauge needle).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3.13 Unable to tolerate blood draw or research biopsy procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3.14 Current smokers or smoked at all within the last 10 years, or have a lifetime smoking&#xD;
        history greater than 25 pack-years. (One pack year is equal to smoking 1 pack per day for 1&#xD;
        year; 5 pack years = one pack/day for 5 yrs, or ½ pack/day for 10 yrs, etc.). There is&#xD;
        evidence that smoking increases the likelihood of detecting mutations in cancer-related&#xD;
        genes in plasma DNA in healthy individuals (i.e., who do not have detectable cancer) (15,&#xD;
        16). We wish to avoid detecting such genetic lesions in this pilot study by excluding&#xD;
        current, recent and heavy smokers&#xD;
