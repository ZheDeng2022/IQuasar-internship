  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Entecavir (ETV) has shown superior ability to suppress hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication,&#xD;
      histology improvement as well as low rate of emergence of resistant mutants. Out of range of&#xD;
      clinical recommendations for treatment of chronic hepatitis B (CHB), chronic HBV carriers&#xD;
      with persistently normal ALT and viral load more than 10^5 copies/mL have progression of&#xD;
      liver disease during long-term follow-up. In addition, certain proportions of these patients&#xD;
      do have significant inflammation and fibrosis in liver histology. This study will be able to&#xD;
      identify who are at risk of liver disease progression and evaluate efficacy of ETV regarding&#xD;
      improvement of liver histology during short-term (1-year) and long-term ETV treatment&#xD;
      (3-year).&#xD;

      TITLE : A Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-control Study Evaluating the Efficacy of&#xD;
      Entecavir in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis B Virus Infection and Persistently Normal&#xD;
      Alanine Aminotransferase INDICATION : Chronic hepatitis B virus infection with persistently&#xD;
      normal ALT&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective To evaluate the efficacy of entecavir (ETV) in improving liver histology in&#xD;
      patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection and persistently normal ALT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is to compare the proportion of subjects in each treatment group who&#xD;
      achieve the histologic Endpoint, defined as improvement in the necroinflammatory score (≥ 2&#xD;
      point decrease in Knodell HAI score) and no worsening of fibrosis (≥ 1 point increase in the&#xD;
      Knodell fibrosis score), at the Week 52 compared to baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the proportion of subjects in each treatment group with the following objectives&#xD;
      at week 52, week 104, and week 156, and post-dosing 24 weeks:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Undetectable HBV DNA by the Roche TaqMan® HBV Test (limit of detection 60 IU/mL); HBV&#xD;
           DNA by PCR will also be evaluated as a continuous parameter;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The reduction of HBV DNA from baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN This is a 3-year prospective randomized, double-blind, placebo-control study.&#xD;
      Enrolled subjects will be allocated according to HBeAg status (HBeAg-positive and&#xD;
      HBeAg-negative), then randomized to ETV or placebo group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETV group: 1st year: ETV 0.5mg qd, then open with ETV 0.5mg qd for 2nd, 3rd year Placebo gr:&#xD;
      1st year: placebo, then open with ETV 0.5mg for 2nd, 3rd year&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose of ETV: 0.5 mg/day Screening period: 6 weeks Timing of liver biopsy: baseline, 52th&#xD;
      week, 156th week NUMBER OF PATIENTS 130 (1:1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PERIOD NOV 2007 ~ MAY 2011 DRUG ADMINISTRAITON Route: oral Dose: ETV 0.5 mg/day&#xD;
      Comparable placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Sample size determination:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An evaluation of the efficacy of entecavir compared to placebo is planned. A test for&#xD;
      superiority of entecavir to placebo will be conducted that has high power to demonstrate&#xD;
      superiority if there are larger histologic improvements of clinical importance. Histologic&#xD;
      improvement after one year is estimated as 50% of entecavir treatment and 25% of placebo.&#xD;
      Thus, a sample size of 47 will be required for 90% of confidence level with 5% of error.&#xD;
      Finally, we estimate that it will be appropriate to enroll 65 patients in each arm due to&#xD;
      probably patients' withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analyses The difference in response rates for the Histologic Endpoint&#xD;
      (entecavir-placebo) along with its standard error and 95% confidence interval will be&#xD;
      computed. Subset analyses defined by prognostic variables [e.g. gender, and HBV DNA level]&#xD;
      for the Histologic Endpoint will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Change from baseline at Week 52 and 156 in Knodell Scores will also be summarized as a&#xD;
      continuous parameter. The secondary efficacy variables will also be summarized and compared&#xD;
      between the treatment groups.&#xD;
