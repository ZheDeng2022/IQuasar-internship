      This research study is a PHase II clinical trial, which tests the safety and effectiveness of&#xD;
      an investigational combination of drugs to learn whether the combination of drugs works in&#xD;
      treating a specific cancer. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the combination of drugs is being&#xD;
      studied. It also means that the FDA has not yet approved these drugs or combination of drugs&#xD;
      for use in participants, including people with your type of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tivozanib is an anti-angiogenesis medicine that fights cancer by cutting off a tumor's blood&#xD;
      supply so that it does not get the blood and nutrients it needs to grow. This drug has been&#xD;
      used in other research studies and information from those other research studies suggests&#xD;
      that this drug may help to slow the growth of cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gemcitabine is a chemotherapy drug that is approved by the FDA for the treatment of&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer and several other cancers. It is not approved for the treatment of renal&#xD;
      cell carcinoma. Previous research suggests combining gemcitabine with tivozanib may have some&#xD;
      effectiveness in treating metastatic renal cell carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research study is to determine the effectiveness of tivozanib as a&#xD;
      treatment for renal cell carcinoma. The purpose of this research study is to also determine&#xD;
      if the combination of tivozanib and gemcitabine is effective in treating your type of cancer&#xD;
      if your cancer becomes unresponsive or gets worse with tivozanib as treatment alone. The&#xD;
      safety of the combination of tivozanib and gemcitabine will also wbe studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another goal of this research study is to learn more about how tivozanib alone and the&#xD;
      combination of tivozanib and gemcitabine may work to treat renal cell carcinoma. During the&#xD;
      research study we will perform blood tests to measure the level of substances in the blood&#xD;
      such as proteins (biomarkers) that may predict who will respond to treatment with tivozanib&#xD;
      and gemcitabine.&#xD;

      If you agree to participate in this study you will be asked to undergo some screening tests&#xD;
      and procedures to confirm that you are eligible. Many of these tests and procedures are&#xD;
      likely to be part of regular cancer care and may be done even if it turns out that you do not&#xD;
      take part in this study. If you have had some of these tests and procedures recently, they&#xD;
      may or may not need to be repeated. The screening process will include the following: medical&#xD;
      history, physical examination, measurement of vital signs, performance status assessment,&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (EKG), echocardiogram (ECHO), CT or MRI, routine blood tests, urine sample,&#xD;
      blood pregnancy test. If these tests show that you are eligible to participate in the&#xD;
      research study, you will begin the study treatment. If you do not meet the eligibility&#xD;
      criteria, you will not be able to participate in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is broken into two segments. In the first segment, you will receive tivozanib&#xD;
      alone. Every 28 days in this study is called a study &quot;cycle&quot;. You will come to clinic once&#xD;
      every 28 days (once a month), on 'day 1' of each 28 day cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tivozanib is a pill that you take by mouth. You will take it once per day, in the morning,&#xD;
      with a glass of water, with or without food. You will take tivozanib days 1-21 (the first&#xD;
      three weeks) of each 28 day treatment cycle. You will be given a Study Drug Administration&#xD;
      Diary to keep a brief record of the date and time when you take your dose of tivozanib. The&#xD;
      study staff will explain to you how to complete your diary. This will be reviewed during yur&#xD;
      visits by your doctor or a member of the study staff. This diary will be collected at your&#xD;
      visit at the end of each cycle, and a new one will be given to you at the start of the next&#xD;
      cycle. You will also have a pre-dose research blood draw (approximately 8 teaspoons of blood&#xD;
      will be drawn) prior to your first dose of tivozanib, and after your first cycle of&#xD;
      tivozanib. Your samples will not have personal information about you (such as your name and&#xD;
      address) on them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of every cycle you will have: a medical history, physical exam, measurement of your&#xD;
      vital signs, performance status assessment, routine blood tests to monitor your health, urine&#xD;
      sample. Every other cycle (prior to cycle 3, 5, 7 etc). you will have a CT or MRI scan, EKG,&#xD;
      ECHO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If your cancer gets worse while receiving tivozanib alone you may be eligible to participate&#xD;
      in segment 2 of the study and receive tivozanib in combination with gemcitabine. You will&#xD;
      come to the clinic on days 1 and 8 of each 28 day cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gemcitabine will be given through a vein (intravenously, or IV) over a period of 30 minutes&#xD;
      at the study clinic. This is called an infusion. You will receive the gemcitabine on days 1&#xD;
      and 8 of each treatment cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will also have a pre-dose research blood draw (approximately 8 teaspoons of blood will be&#xD;
      drawn) prior to your first cycle of tivozanib and gemcitabine in combination, after your&#xD;
      first 28 days cycle of tivozanib and gemcitabine in combination, and if your cancer gets&#xD;
      worse while receiving tivozanib and gemcitabine in combination. Your samples will not have&#xD;
      personal information about you (such as your name and address) on them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If your doctor determines it is safe for you to have a biopsy, you will undergo a fresh tumor&#xD;
      biopsy at the following time points: Prior to receiving your first 28 day cycle of tivozanib&#xD;
      and gemcitabine in combination; and after two 28 day cycles (roughly 2 months) of receiving&#xD;
      tivozanib and gemcitabine in combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 1 and 8 and at the end of study treatment you will undergo a medical history,&#xD;
      physical examination, measurement of vital signs, performance status assessment, routine&#xD;
      blood tests and a urine sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If an unexpected or unwanted event happens during the study, you may be asked to have some&#xD;
      extra tests or measurements. Some of the tests or measurements done during the study may have&#xD;
      to be repeated if the results are not usable or are abnormal. If additional visits are&#xD;
      required during your participation in this study, your study doctor may perform the following&#xD;
      procedures and evaluations: medical history, vital sign measurements, physical exam, ECG,&#xD;
      performance status, blood and urine tests and/or a review of your study drug administration&#xD;
      diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We would like to keep track of your medical condition indefinitely. If we do not hear from&#xD;
      you, we would like to do this by calling no more than every three months to see how you are&#xD;
      doing. Keeping in touch with you and checking your condition helps us look at the long-term&#xD;
      effects of the research.&#xD;
