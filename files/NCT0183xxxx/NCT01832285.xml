      The purpose of this study is to determine effect of Fluvoxamine augmentation on cognitive&#xD;
      function , aggressive behavior , clinical symptoms and mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) and&#xD;
      protein expression in human peripheral mononuclear blood cells (PMC) in medicated&#xD;
      schizophrenia patients&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Clinical studies have shown that adding selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)&#xD;
      antidepressants to antipsychotics can improve negative symptoms of schizophrenia in patients&#xD;
      unresponsive to antipsychotics alone . The effect of SSRI augmentation on cognitive&#xD;
      impairments of the illness which do not respond to antipsychotics and are associated with&#xD;
      poor outcome has not been adequately tested .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent study we showed that SSRI augmentation alters expression of gamma-aminobutyric&#xD;
      acid(GABA A) receptor, protein kinase(PKC), brain-derived neurotrophic factor(BDNF) and&#xD;
      related systems in peripheral mononuclear blood cells (PMC)of schizophrenia patients . There&#xD;
      is evidence that these systems are abnormal in schizophrenia patients and are associated with&#xD;
      cognitive and negative symptoms strengthening the likelihood that their modulation by SSRI&#xD;
      augmentation can improve cognitive impairments .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Behavioral disturbance , particularly aggression is another feature of schizophrenia which is&#xD;
      difficult to treat and leads to social and legal complications and poor outcome. Aggression&#xD;
      is associated with serotoninergic dysfunction and there is evidence that SSRI can modify&#xD;
      aggressive behavior including in schizophrenia patients .Thus this study will also examine&#xD;
      the effect of SSRI augmentation on aggressive behavior and other behavioral and functional&#xD;
      measures .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanism of SSRI augmentation is not known and is the focus of research interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have recently shown in laboratory studies that combined treatment of SSRI antidepressant&#xD;
      and antipsychotic drug resulted in biochemical changes, different from the effects of the&#xD;
      individual medications. Changes unique to the combined treatment were found in GABAergic&#xD;
      components and related systems including GABA-Aβ3 receptor, glutamic acid decarboxylase 67&#xD;
      and PKCβ in selected areas of rat brain and in cultures of cortical neurons. Studies of drug&#xD;
      mechanisms in humans have utilized blood products and PMC which are readily accessible and&#xD;
      may reflect molecular processes in the central nervous system (CNS) of schizophrenic patients&#xD;
      .Using this method in schizophrenia patients treated with SSRI augmentation we showed that&#xD;
      changes in mRNA encoding for GABA A receptor , PKC and related proteins were associated with&#xD;
      clinical improvement indicating that the changes observe in the laboratory have clinical&#xD;
      relevance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods The dose of antipsychotics will be unchanged for at least 2 weeks prior to the study&#xD;
      and will remain steady throughout the study period. Fluvoxamine 100mg/day will be added to&#xD;
      the treatment regimen and continued for 6 weeks. Clinical state will be assessed using&#xD;
      validated rating scales and cognitive performance will be assessed with a cognitive test&#xD;
      battery. Behavior and function , including s will be assessed with appropriate scales Blood&#xD;
      samples will be taken at baseline and at 1, 3 and 6 weeks.At the end of the study protocol&#xD;
      (after 6 weeks) the patients will be given the option to continue receiving the fluvoxamine.&#xD;
      It can be assumed that the included subjects would not have received fluvoxamine if it&#xD;
      weren't for their participation in the study for lack of indication for their primary&#xD;
      diagnosis (see inclusion criteria below). The PMC's will be assayed using microarray, (PCR)&#xD;
      polymerase chain reaction and proteomic techniques. Changes in RNA and protein expression&#xD;
      will be detected and compared with changes in clinical symptoms , cognitive function and&#xD;
      behavioral change . Identification of biochemical changes related to augmentation treated and&#xD;
      their relation to symptomatic and cognitive changes will be the major potential benefit of&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects 40 chronic schizophrenic or schizoaffective patients (DSM-IVTR)who have persistent&#xD;
      negative symptoms and cognitive impairment despite adequate treatment will participate. The&#xD;
      sample will include patients with a history of aggressive behavior hospitalized in the&#xD;
      forensic wards and as well as patients in regular hospital wards and outpatients settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments The diagnosis will determined by a consensus of two senior psychiatrists using&#xD;
      the DSM-IVTR criteria. Physical assessment (which includes a physical examination as well as&#xD;
      measurements of blood pressure and pulse) will be taken from the patient's medical records&#xD;
      prior to the commencement of the study. Background and demographic characteristics, details&#xD;
      of the present illness, medications, general medical history and current laboratory tests&#xD;
      will also be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical state and cognitive function will be assessed prior to fluvoxamine treatment and&#xD;
      then during the study period according to the flow sheet below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical assessment scales will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schedule for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS); Schedule for the Assessment of&#xD;
      Positive Symptoms (SAPS); Simpson Angus Scale for Extrapyramidal Side Effects; Abnormal&#xD;
      Involuntary Movement Scales (AIMS); Calgary Depression Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive assessment will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mini Mental State Examination, Dot test, Digit Span, Finger Tap Test modified, Wechsler&#xD;
      memory tests. Computerized Cognitive Neuropsychological Battery:Computerized judgment of line&#xD;
      orientation (CJOLO); Penn face memory test (PFMT); Visual object learning test (VOLT);&#xD;
      Abstraction inhibition and working memory task (AIM), Identification of facial emotions&#xD;
      (PEAT); Differentiation of facial emotion (EMDIF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Behavioral and function assessment Overt aggression Scale GAF (DSM IV TR) Critical Events&#xD;
      Blood tests Approx 50cc of blood will be taken at baseline, prior to start of fluvoxamine&#xD;
      treatment, and 1,3 and 6 weeks after the start of fluvoxamine treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of blood samples: Blood will be collected into heparinized tubes, kept on ice and&#xD;
      transported to the laboratory. Blood samples will be processed to enable assay of PMC&#xD;
      elements of interest, including chemokine receptors, G protein receptors such as the GABAA&#xD;
      receptor , their regulators such as, PKC GSK3 RGS7 and neurotrophins such as BDNF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some of the serum will be frozen for subsequent analyses of antipsychotic drug and&#xD;
      neurohormone concentration. The blood samples will be stored in the molecular neuropsychiatry&#xD;
      laboratory at the Technion Institute of Technology (Haifa) under the supervision of the&#xD;
      principal investigator, Prof. Henry Silver. The samples will be unnamed and numbered. They&#xD;
      will be kept for a maximum of 10 years. The participants will be given the option to ask for&#xD;
      the destruction of the samples at any time.&#xD;

      Implementation of the protocol The implementation of the protocol will involve a team of&#xD;
      research clinicians from Sha'ar Menashe Mental Health Center (Hadera) as well as the Technion&#xD;
      Institute of Technology (Haifa) under the direction of the principal investigator, Prof.&#xD;
      Henry Silver. Clinical and cognitive ratings will be each respectively obtained by one rater&#xD;
      in order to eliminate inter-rater bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Statistical analysis of all studied parameters will be done between&#xD;
      repeated measures using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the t-test. For nonparametric&#xD;
      distributions the Mann Whitney U test and the chi test will be utilized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk/Benefit and Safety Considerations The taking of blood sample is the only invasive&#xD;
      procedure. This is a routine procedure accompanied by minor discomfort. Fluvoxamine&#xD;
      augmentation has been studied extensively and has been used safely in numerous studies. Side&#xD;
      effects of fluvoxamine include nausea and GI disturbance. The side effects will be determined&#xD;
      during the clinical assessments on weeks 0,3 and 6 according to the flow sheet above using a&#xD;
      clinical interview as well as a physical examination when necessary. The side effects will be&#xD;
      documented in the study protocol. Severe adverse events will be monitored by the treating&#xD;
      physicians and reported to the team of research clinicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major advance of this methodology is that it enables the detection of RNA and protein&#xD;
      changes in PMC by assigning each subject as his/her own control, and will enable change in&#xD;
      clinical state to be related to the biochemical changes. Thus, the direct potential benefit&#xD;
      for the participants in this study would be improvement cognitive ,behavioral (including&#xD;
      aggressive ) and clinical symptoms, consequently improving their potential for well being and&#xD;
      rehabilitation while the major potential benefit for society would be the identification of&#xD;
      molecular changes accompanying clinical response to SSRI augmentation as a basis for the&#xD;
      understanding of their pharmacological mechanism of action and consequently opening new&#xD;
      vistas for treatments in the future.&#xD;
