      Introduction Osteoarthritis is a chronic disease characterized by a progressive degradation&#xD;
      of articular cartilage. Hand OA involves symptomatically more than 1 million of subjects in&#xD;
      France (i.e., painful or with functional impairment). To date, the treatment of OA is only&#xD;
      symptomatic and no drugs are able to stop the degradative process of cartilage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      50% of patients with hand OA exhibit a functional impairment responsible for a severe&#xD;
      handicap, which is almost similar to rheumatoid arthritis. While the risk factors of hand OA&#xD;
      are well identified (i.e., familial history, female sex, menopause, obesity), clinical&#xD;
      outcome in large cohort is poorly known. In addition, the investigators miss predictive&#xD;
      clinical, biological or imaging factors of severe clinical (i.e. pain, functional impairment&#xD;
      or aesthetic damage) or structural evolution (i.e., aggravation of radiographic scores).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective To investigate in hand OA patients predictive clinical, biological, genetic&#xD;
      and imaging factors of clinical aggravation after 6 years of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives To investigate in hand OA patients predictive clinical, biological,&#xD;
      genetic and imaging factors of clinical aggravation after 3 years of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate in hand OA patients predictive clinical, biological, genetic and imaging&#xD;
      factors of clinical aggravation after 3 years of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate whether variations of clinical evaluation of hand hand OA and radiographic&#xD;
      structural changes are associated or correlated between inclusion and 3 years of follow-up or&#xD;
      between inclusion and 6 years follow-up To investigate whether clinical status and&#xD;
      radiographic alterations are correlated at inclusion To determine whether hand OA is&#xD;
      associated with OA at other sites or with other hand diseases (carpal tunnel syndrome,&#xD;
      tendinitis) To evaluate frequency of erosive hand OA among the whole hand OA cohort at&#xD;
      inclusion, at 3 and 6 years of follow-up To identify clinical, biological, genetic and&#xD;
      imaging factors associated with erosive hand OA (versus non erosive hand OA) at inclusion or&#xD;
      during the follow up (3 and 6 years) To investigate predictive clinical, biological, genetic&#xD;
      and imaging factors of clinical or radiographic aggravation after 3 or 6 years of follow-up&#xD;
      in the erosive hand OA subgroup&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods :&#xD;
&#xD;
      the investigators plan to include 500 patients in the cohort (5/week) 7 visits (one per year)&#xD;
      are planned: M0, M12, M24, M36, M48, M60 and M72. A clinical evaluation of hand OA will be&#xD;
      performed at each visit. At visit M0, M36 and M72, hand radiographs and radiographs of other&#xD;
      OA localisation (if symptomatic) will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A blood sample will be taken at inclusion for biomarker studies and genetic investigations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A blood sample will be taken at M36 and M72 to build a prospective serum collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of the study: 8.5 years with 2.5 years of inclusion period Duration of the study for&#xD;
      one patient: 6 years Recruitment at the Rheumatology Department of Saint-Antoine Hospital&#xD;
      with a multicentric international steering committee&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential outcomes :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identification of clinical, radiological and biological tools useful to predict clinical&#xD;
           and structural outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Description of the history course of hand OA and predictive factors of severe evolution&#xD;
           (i.e. erosive form of hand OA) To integrate in daily practice, clinical and radiological&#xD;
           tools allowing a standardized follow up of hand OA patients.&#xD;

&#xD;
      To investigate in hand OA patients predictive clinical, biological, genetic and imaging&#xD;
      factors of clinical aggravation between inclusion and 3 years of follow-up and between&#xD;
      inclusion and the end of follow-up at 6 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the clinical, biological and radiographic factors predictive of the radiographic&#xD;
      progression of OA between inclusion and 3 years but also between inclusion and 6 years To&#xD;
      investigate whether clinical changes and radiographic structural changes are associated or&#xD;
      correlated between inclusion and 3 years of follow-up or between inclusion and 6 years of&#xD;
      follow-up To investigate whether clinical status and radiographic alterations are correlated&#xD;
      at inclusion To determine whether hand OA is associated with other OA at other sites or with&#xD;
      other hand diseases (carpal tunnel syndrome, tendinitis) To evaluate frequency of erosive&#xD;
      hand OA among the whole hand OA cohort at inclusion, at 3 and 6 years of follow-up To&#xD;
      identify clinical, biological, genetic and imaging factors associated with erosive hand OA&#xD;
      (versus non erosive hand OA) at inclusion or during the follow up (3 and 6 years) To&#xD;
      investigate predictive clinical, biological, genetic and imaging factors of clinical or&#xD;
      radiographic aggravation after 3 or 6 years of follow-up in the erosive hand OA subgroup To&#xD;
      perform a cross-sectional analysis of the correlation between clinical tools and erosive&#xD;
      radiographic involvement at inclusion (in the population with erosive hand OA at inclusion) ;&#xD;
      To evaluate the frequency of fibromyalgia at 3 years of follow-up and at the end of the&#xD;
      follow-up at 6 years ; To evaluate the frequency of neuropathic pain at 3 years of follow-up&#xD;
      and at the end of the follow-up at 6 years ; To evaluate the pressure pain threshold at 3&#xD;
      years of follow-up and at the end of the follow-up at 6 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods : Prospective observational study The study will be proposed to all patients viewed&#xD;
      at the out-patient clinic for hand OA which took place in Saint-Antoine Hospital in&#xD;
      Rheumatology Department since 2004 (usually 12/week). The investigators plan to include 500&#xD;
      patients in the cohort (5/week).&#xD;
