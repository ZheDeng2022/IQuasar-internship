      This pilot clinical trial studies 6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid in treating patients with&#xD;
      locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as&#xD;
      6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,&#xD;
      either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine initial estimates of overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine response rate. II. To determine progression free survival (PFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive 6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days 1-5&#xD;
      of week 1 (pre-course 1 only), days 1 and 4 of weeks 2 and 3 (course 1 only), and days 1 and&#xD;
      4 of weeks 1-3 (courses 2-6). Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 6 courses in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
