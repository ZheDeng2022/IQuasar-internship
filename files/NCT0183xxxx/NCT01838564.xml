      Over 50% of children dying from cancer still suffer from symptoms that could be effectively&#xD;
      alleviated. The purpose of the Pediatric Quality of Life and Evaluation of Symptoms&#xD;
      Technology (PediQUEST) Study was to evaluate whether providing feedback to families and&#xD;
      providers about how the child is feeling improved child distress and quality of life (QoL) in&#xD;
      children with advanced cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PediQUEST is a computerized survey that asks the child and/or parents how the child has been&#xD;
      feeling, i.e. whether the child had any physical or emotional symptoms, as well as how other&#xD;
      aspects of life, such as school and friends, are going. After the survey is complete a report&#xD;
      that summarizes patient/parent answers is printed. When a child reports moderate to high&#xD;
      distress from any symptom an email is automatically sent to the primary providers&#xD;
      (oncologist, nurse, and psycho-social clinician as well as the pain and palliative care&#xD;
      services) alerting them about the child's distress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we evaluated whether using PediQUEST and providing printed reports to parents&#xD;
      and providers reduced distress and improved quality of life in children with advanced cancer.&#xD;
      In addition, we wanted to understand whether it was feasible to carry out a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial in children with advanced cancer. Finally, the data collected, will be used&#xD;
      to describe the natural history of symptoms and quality of life as reported by the children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children enrolled in the study (or their parents) were asked to complete a PediQUEST survey&#xD;
      at most once a week. A random half of the children received the feedback intervention, i.e.&#xD;
      patients, parents, and providers received printed reports (and emails if the child was in&#xD;
      distress). The other half only completed the PediQUEST surveys and did not receive reports.&#xD;
      We analyzed data collected over 20 weeks of follow-up to see whether receiving PediQUEST&#xD;
      reports had any effect on child distress and quality of life.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Introduction: Cancer is the leading cause of nonaccidental death in childhood.(Arias et al.&#xD;
      2003) In spite of significant scientific progress, one quarter of children with cancer still&#xD;
      do not survive(Greenlee et al. 2000), and over 50% experience substantial suffering that&#xD;
      could be alleviated.(Wolfe et al. 2000a) Pediatric palliative care is now an expected&#xD;
      standard of care and research in this field has been established as a national priority by&#xD;
      the Institute of Medicine (IOM).(Field et al. 2003) Earlier work by our group suggested that&#xD;
      when parents and physicians recognized at an early stage that a child had no realistic chance&#xD;
      of cure, they were more likely to integrate elements of effective palliation into the child's&#xD;
      care. However, this early stage concordance about prognosis was rare.(Wolfe et al. 2000b)&#xD;
      Communication and delivery of optimal care in the advanced stages of illness is especially&#xD;
      challenging in children.(Shelton 1999) The anticipation of losing a child and physicians' own&#xD;
      difficulties(Saunders 1979-80; Hilden et al. 2001) may hinder discussions about poor&#xD;
      prognosis and impact on decision-making and integration of palliative care. Thus attention to&#xD;
      symptom management and quality of life (QoL) in children with advanced cancer may be limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collection of standardized symptom and QoL data has shown to enhance physician's&#xD;
      recognition, knowledge and accuracy in the assessment and palliation of symptoms, and to&#xD;
      increase patient-provider discussions about QoL issues and directly improve patient's&#xD;
      QoL.(Detmar et al. 2002; Taenzer et al. 2000; Velikova et al. 2004) Whether these findings&#xD;
      are applicable to children remains to be established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the obstacles to routine symptom and QoL assessment in children is the need of&#xD;
      developmentally adapted(Eiser et al. 2001b; Eiser et al. 2001c; Hain 1997) and parent-proxy&#xD;
      tools(Eiser et al. 2001a), making the paper and pencil format extremely impractical.&#xD;
      Computerized surveys offered a potential solution. Patient acceptance of such devices has&#xD;
      been found to be high.(Buxton et al. 1998; Velikova et al. 2002; Velikova et al. 1999;&#xD;
      Velikova et al. 2001) Our current project -the PediQUEST Study- consists of a pilot for a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed at assessing the effect of routinely reporting&#xD;
      symptom and QoL data. We will use an innovative data collection strategy: a hand-held&#xD;
      computer devise, the Pediatric Quality of Life and Evaluation of Symptoms Technology&#xD;
      (PediQUEST) that readily administers a user-appropriate survey instrument and generates&#xD;
      reports summarizing how the patient feels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As far as we are aware of, this will be the first RCT conducted in children with advanced&#xD;
      cancer to evaluate a palliative care intervention. Given the challenges with doing research&#xD;
      in this population, we propose to simultaneously focus on several goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: Aim 1: (Feasibility study) Assess the feasibility of conducting a randomized controlled&#xD;
      supportive care trial (RCT) in children with advanced cancer. Aim 2: (PediQUEST Evaluation)&#xD;
      Preliminarily assess the effect of routinely feeding back QoL and symptom data to families&#xD;
      and primary oncologists, and alerting supportive care teams about highly distressing&#xD;
      symptoms. Aim 3: (Descriptive study) Prospectively explore determinants of child's suffering&#xD;
      and parental-physician discordance regarding prognosis and treatment goals in children with&#xD;
      advanced cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Aim 1: Cohort survey study; Aim 2: Pilot prospective RCT; Aim 3: Cohort study&#xD;
      embedded in an RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: Three large US pediatric cancer centers. Subjects: 104 children 2-years old and&#xD;
      above with advanced cancer and their parents were enrolled between December 2004 and June&#xD;
      2009.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up: Patients were initially followed up for 9 months or until death whatever occurred&#xD;
      first. However, an interim analysis of the first 29 patients showed that 75% were alive at&#xD;
      nine months, suggesting the enrollment of a healthier cohort. We therefore changed the&#xD;
      follow-up period to 3 months with the option of multiple re-enrollments until the end of data&#xD;
      collection (December 2009) or death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility study: All subjects approached for enrollment were invited to complete a one-time&#xD;
      paper and pencil &quot;Consent survey&quot; regardless of their decision about whether to participate.&#xD;
      All enrolled subjects were asked to complete a paper and pencil &quot;Participation survey&quot; after&#xD;
      completing the study or dropping-out in order to explore determinants of attrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PediQUEST Evaluation and Descriptive studies: Symptom and QOL scores were tracked up to once&#xD;
      a week. Surveys were embedded in the PediQUEST system and administered through tablet&#xD;
      computers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants' recruitment: Eligible children were identified through daily review of clinic&#xD;
      roster with clinic staff including nurses, oncologists and/or nurse practitioners and&#xD;
      verified with the patient's primary oncologist using a checklist sent over email. If after&#xD;
      being introduced to the study and having had the opportunity to ask questions, child and&#xD;
      parent(s) were willing to participate, parent(s) were asked to review and sign the informed&#xD;
      permission/assent document covering the parent(s) and child's participation. A provider's&#xD;
      completion of the eligibility checklist will indicate informed consent of providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Instruments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. PediQUEST survey (PQ-Survey): assessed symptoms, quality of life, and overall sickness.&#xD;
           Nine survey versions were developed to allow for consistent measurement across the age&#xD;
           ranges and respondents. Self-report started at 5 years of age; children aged 5 to 12&#xD;
           years answered shorter, age-adapted questionnaires which were complemented with&#xD;
           additional parental questionnaires; teens answered a full self-report questionnaire.&#xD;
           Parents of children between 2 and 4 years old answered a full survey on their child's&#xD;
           behalf. If a child did not feel well, parents could complete the full questionnaire on&#xD;
           their behalf. PQ-Surveys were pilot tested in 15 patients showing good acceptability and&#xD;
           comprehensibility. PQ-surveys used four tools: 1) PQ-Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale&#xD;
           (MSAS), adapted from previously validated child(Collins et al. 2000; Collins et al.&#xD;
           2002) and proxy(Drake et al. 2003) MSAS, measures frequency, severity and distress for&#xD;
           24 symptoms; 2) Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL), a 22-item health related&#xD;
           quality of life instrument;(Seid et al. 1999; Varni et al. 2002; Varni et al. 2003) 3)&#xD;
           Faces Pain Scale Revised (a faces pain scale, used to measure current pain&#xD;
           intensity);(Hicks et al. 2001) 4) Sickness VAS scale (overall sickness measure created&#xD;
           ad hoc).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Survey about Caring for Children with Cancer (SCCC): In addition, parent and physician&#xD;
           perspectives regarding prognosis and treatment goals were collected at baseline and then&#xD;
           every 3 months using a paper-and-pencil survey SCCC, adapted from our survey for&#xD;
           bereaved parents.(Wolfe et al. 2000b)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Post death survey: If patients died within the study period parents were invited to&#xD;
           complete a post-death survey at least four months following the death to assess distress&#xD;
           during the last month of life and retrospective perspectives regarding the overall&#xD;
           quality of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Satisfaction Surveys: Child and parent surveys were adapted from existing&#xD;
           questionnaires.(Grogan et al. 1995; McCusker 1984; Weaver et al. 1993) Satisfaction with&#xD;
           PQ technology was assessed using seven items for children eight years old and above and&#xD;
           11 items for parents. Surveys were embedded in the PediQUEST system and administered at&#xD;
           fourth and eighth PediQUEST administration. A survey evaluating participant's&#xD;
           satisfaction with the PediQUEST intervention (see below) was administered concurrently&#xD;
           (eight items (parents), five items (children eight years old and above)) to all&#xD;
           intervention participants. Provider satisfaction with the PQ intervention, and perceived&#xD;
           usefulness of the PQ-system was assessed through an online survey administered at the&#xD;
           end of data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Patients were randomly allocated to receive routine feedback about symptoms and&#xD;
      QOL. The feedback intervention had two components: (i) PQ-reports: printed reports were made&#xD;
      available to providers (inserted in charts before the visit) and families (handed immediately&#xD;
      after survey completion at clinic or ward). PQ-reports consisted of bar plots of PedsQL and&#xD;
      MSAS symptom scores from current and four prior administrations, a summary highlighting&#xD;
      changes since last report, and a list of available resources for symptom control (for&#xD;
      families), or generic pain management recommendations (for providers). Training on how to&#xD;
      interpret PQ-reports was offered to families at enrollment and on an annual basis to&#xD;
      providers; (ii) PQ emails: were automatically generated if PQ-MSAS individual symptom scores&#xD;
      were ≥70, or if on two consecutive administrations the patient or parent reported a score of&#xD;
      ≥70 for any frequency, severity or distress item, or a PedsQL total score ≤ 40. E-mails were&#xD;
      sent to primary providers (oncologist, nurse, and psychosocial clinician), the local&#xD;
      palliative care service, and, when pain was reported, the pain service (or equivalent). No&#xD;
      instructions were imparted on how to respond to emails. Families and providers of patients in&#xD;
      the control arm of the study did not receive feedback reports. The allocation process was&#xD;
      embedded in PediQUEST and blinded to investigators until the patient completed the first&#xD;
      survey. Because of the nature of the intervention this was an open label study. As a token of&#xD;
      our appreciation, small non-monetary incentives were provided to children, parents, and&#xD;
      providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: This study explores the feasibility of conducting an RCT assessing a supportive&#xD;
      care intervention in children with advanced cancer (aim 1). It also provides estimates of&#xD;
      consent and attrition rates, its determinants, and the burden associated with repeated&#xD;
      measurements. In addition, this pilot study will preliminarily assess the impact of feedback&#xD;
      on child's distress and quality of life. Main outcomes of this efficacy study (aim 2) are&#xD;
      presented below. This pilot study will render sufficient data for accurate sample size&#xD;
      calculation for future studies and serve to explore determinants of suffering in children&#xD;
      with advanced cancer (aim 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PediQUEST Evaluation (Aim 2): To assess the effect of PediQUEST, the proportion of patients&#xD;
      with unrelieved symptoms in each arm will be compared using odds ratios and associated&#xD;
      chi-square tests. To assess the progression of reported levels of child's distress and QOL&#xD;
      trends, we will run a mixed effects model that assumes a linear trend in the outcome over 20&#xD;
      weeks of follow up for each subject. The model will examine the difference in the average&#xD;
      trend over time (slope) between the intervention and control group by including a fixed&#xD;
      effect term that represents the interaction of treatment status and time since study entry.&#xD;
      Lack of difference between slope coefficients will support the null hypothesis of no effect&#xD;
      by the intervention. Single point secondary outcomes will be analyzed by comparing both arms&#xD;
      with a t test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous outcomes and odds ratios and&#xD;
      associated chi-square tests for proportions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size and Power Calculations A formal sample size estimation was not possible given the&#xD;
      lack of data on distribution of scores in an advanced cancer population or their variation&#xD;
      over time. For this reason we originally proposed to recruit 120 patients and their parents,&#xD;
      a sample size driven by practical rather than statistical considerations that would serve as&#xD;
      a basis for future sample size calculations. We estimated that 60 subjects per arm would&#xD;
      allow for an adequate balance between arms and likely provide sufficient power to detect&#xD;
      large clinical effects for single point measurements.&#xD;
