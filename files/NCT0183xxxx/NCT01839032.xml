      Patients (pts) with stage IIIA/IIIB NSCLC received NVBiv 25 mg/m² + CDDP 80 mg/m² on D1 and&#xD;
      NVBo 60 mg/m² on D8 every 3 weeks (q3w) for 2 cycles as induction. Pts with response or non&#xD;
      change received NVBo 20 mg fixed dose on D1 D3 D5 + CDDP 80 mg/m² on D1 q3w for 2 more cycles&#xD;
      during RT(66 Gy/6.5 w).&#xD;

      Vinorelbine (NVB) + CDDP is considered a standard trt in induction or concomitantly with RT&#xD;
      (Vokes, Fournel, Krzakowski). NVBo simplifies the administration of trt and provides the same&#xD;
      efficacy as intravenous NVB (NVBiv). In order to assess this and to improve the tolerance, a&#xD;
      trial was started with NVBiv and NVBo + CDDP as induction followed by a fractionated&#xD;
      administration of NVBo + CDDP during RT.&#xD;

    <description>During the induction period, patients received chemotherapy for two 3-week cycles. Bolus intravenous vinorelbine 25 mg/m², was administered on day 1, then cisplatin 80 mg/m² was administered over 1-hour infusion. Vinorelbine 60 mg/m² was also administered on day 8.&#xD;
Patients with objective response (OR) or no change (NC) continued the concomitant period (CP) including two additional 3-week cycles of radio chemotherapy (vinorelvine 20 mg D1 D3 D5 Cisplatin 80 mg/m² 66 Gy).</description>
