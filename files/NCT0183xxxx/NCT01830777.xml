    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial. Phase I trials test the safety of an&#xD;
      investigational drug or combination of drugs. These trials also try to define the appropriate&#xD;
      dose of the investigational drug to use for further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the&#xD;
      combination of drugs is still being studied and that research doctors are trying to find out&#xD;
      more about it. As part of this research study, patients will be administered brentuximab&#xD;
      vedotin in combination with a conventional re-induction chemotherapy regimen called MEC,&#xD;
      which consists of the chemotherapy drugs mitoxantrone, etoposide, and cytarabine. Brentuximab&#xD;
      vedotin has not been approved by the FDA for the patient's cancer. However, brentuximab&#xD;
      targets a protein on tumors called CD30, and it is approved for other cancers which express&#xD;
      CD30, and these include Hodgkin lymphoma. This means that the FDA has not approved giving&#xD;
      brentuximab in conjunction with MEC for use in people, including people with this type of&#xD;
      malignancy, acute myeloid leukemia (AML).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mitoxantrone, etoposide and cytarabine are chemotherapy agents that are commonly used to&#xD;
      treat individuals with relapsed AML. Brentuximab is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), which&#xD;
      is the combination of an antibody (a protein that binds to cells) and a drug. Brentuximab&#xD;
      vedotin works by using the antibody portion to enter into CD30-positive cells and then&#xD;
      releasing the drug portion, which attempts to destroy the cell. Brentuximab vedotin has been&#xD;
      used in laboratory and other research studies and information from those studies suggest that&#xD;
      brentuximab vedotin may slow down the spread of cancers which express CD30. Some AML cell&#xD;
      express CD30, so investigators hope that brentuximab vedotin will help with this type of AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of this research study is to determine the highest dose that Brentuximab&#xD;
      vedotin can safely be given with MEC without severe or unmanageable side effects. The dose&#xD;
      identified in this study will be used in future research studies.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      If patients agree to participate in this research study they will be asked to undergo some&#xD;
      screening tests or procedures to determine eligibility. Many of these tests and procedures&#xD;
      are likely to be part of regular cancer care and may be done even if it turns out that&#xD;
      patients do not take part in the research study. If patients have had some of these tests or&#xD;
      procedures recently, they may or may not have to be repeated. These tests and procedures will&#xD;
      include: a medical history, physical exam, performance status, pregnancy test, urine test,&#xD;
      electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, blood tests, and bone marrow aspirate/biopsy. If these&#xD;
      tests show that patients are eligible to participate in the research study, they will begin&#xD;
      the study treatment. If patients do not meet the eligibility criteria, they will not be able&#xD;
      to participate in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To start re-induction therapy, patients will receive brentuximab vedotin alone on Day 1. They&#xD;
      will begin treatment with MEC (mitoxantrone, etoposide and cytarabine) a few days later (on&#xD;
      Day 3). Since investigators are looking for the highest dose at which brentuximab vedotin can&#xD;
      be safely administered with MEC without severe or unmanageable side effects in those with&#xD;
      AML, not everyone who participates in this research study will receive the same dose of the&#xD;
      study drug. The dose a patient receives will depend on the number of participants who have&#xD;
      been enrolled in the study before that patient and how well they have tolerated their doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, treatment will be broken up into segments. Study treatment will occur in two&#xD;
      segments: 1) Re-Induction Therapy; and 2) Maintenance Therapy. Re-induction therapy, as&#xD;
      described above, will be the combination of brentuximab vedotin followed on day 3 by MEC&#xD;
      chemotherapy. The maintenance phase of therapy will only include brentuximab vedotin&#xD;
      administered every 21 days for a total period of 12 months, and does not include any other&#xD;
      chemotherapy. The treatment and assessments that may be required fo patients during these&#xD;
      phases of therapy are explained below. The following assessments will be completed while&#xD;
      patients are on the trial: physical exam, performance status, urine test, blood tests and&#xD;
      bone marrow aspirate/biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first part of the study treatment is called &quot;re-induction&quot;. During re-induction, patients&#xD;
      will be admitted to the Massachusetts General Hospital and will receive study treatment on an&#xD;
      in-patient basis. Patients will receive brentuximab vedotin IV (intravenously or through a&#xD;
      vein) alone on Day 1. They will then receive the following standard drugs (the MEC regimen)&#xD;
      starting on day 3. This regimen includes the chemotherapy drugs mitoxantrone, etoposide, and&#xD;
      cytarabine, all given by IV and beginning on Day 3 and continuing through Day 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If at the end of the re-induction course, the number of leukemia cells have not decreased as&#xD;
      much as expected or desired, patients will be removed from the study and given alternative&#xD;
      options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second part of study treatment is called &quot;maintenance&quot; and can be given on an outpatient&#xD;
      basis in clinic. During maintenance, patients will be administered brentuximab vedotin once&#xD;
      every 21 days, at the same dose as that given during the re-induction course. This 21 day&#xD;
      period will be called a cycle, and will be repeated until 12 months have passed from the&#xD;
      start of the maintenance therapy phase. During this phase, participants will not receive&#xD;
      other chemotherapies and will not be hospitalized for treatment. During the maintenance&#xD;
      phase, investigators will continue to collect approximately 2 to 3 teaspoons of blood for&#xD;
      research purposes every 3-4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators would like to keep track of patients' medical condition and overall health&#xD;
      following the 12 months of treatment on study. Investigators may ask patients questions about&#xD;
      their general health, current medications and disease status. Investigators will also check&#xD;
      on any new anticancer therapy patients may have started.&#xD;
