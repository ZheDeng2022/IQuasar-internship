  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the preliminary effectiveness and&#xD;
      acceptability of an innovative in-home nonpharmacological intervention, the Veterans' In-home&#xD;
      Program (VIP), for Veterans with mild to moderate traumatic brain injury (TBI) and their&#xD;
      families. VIP is designed to promote community reintegration, improve quality of life, and&#xD;
      support functioning by realigning environmental demands to match the Veteran's abilities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research Design: Using a 2-group randomized control trial, the investigators will evaluate&#xD;
      the intervention in comparison to usual care. Usual care is traditional clinic-based care,&#xD;
      which will be enhanced by 2 phone calls to provide an attention control condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: Participants will be 100 Veterans diagnosed with mild to moderate TBI who are&#xD;
      followed by the Philadelphia VA Medical Center (PVAMC) Polytrauma Service and a family member&#xD;
      (100) of each Veteran. All Veterans will have a family member or partner living with them who&#xD;
      is willing to participate in the study. The intervention and study interviews will occur in&#xD;
      Veterans' homes. Qualitative phone interviews with a subset of the sample who received the&#xD;
      intervention will be conducted at PVAMC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary study outcomes for the Veterans will be physical, cognitive, and&#xD;
      emotional/interpersonal functioning and community reintegration, measured by standardized&#xD;
      instruments at baseline and follow-up at 3 to 4 months. Study outcomes for family members&#xD;
      will be mood and dimensions of well-being, measured by standardized instruments at baseline&#xD;
      and follow-up at 3 to 4 months. Acceptability of the intervention for Veterans and family&#xD;
      members will be measured through Project Evaluations, administered at follow-up with both&#xD;
      groups. In addition, qualitative phone interviews will be conducted with a subset of Veterans&#xD;
      and family members who received VIP to evaluate VIP's acceptability and to enhance&#xD;
      understanding of the impact of VIP from the perspective of those experiencing it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on a person-environment fit framework, the VIP intervention consists of 8 sessions (up&#xD;
      to 6 in the home and 2 telephone contacts) delivered by occupational therapists over a 3&#xD;
      month period to Veterans and family members. VIP realigns environmental demands to match&#xD;
      Veterans' abilities through the modification of home environments, development of meaningful&#xD;
      activities tailored to Veterans' strengths, training in the use of emotion-regulation&#xD;
      strategies to address behavioral/interpersonal difficulties, and training in the use of&#xD;
      cognitive strategies to compensate for cognitive impairments. In its family focus, VIP&#xD;
      provides family members with education and training to understand and manage the Veterans'&#xD;
      limitations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical relationships: VIP extends and adds value to traditional on-site clinical care by&#xD;
      helping individuals with TBI and their families in the setting where most functional and&#xD;
      behavioral problems emerge. As a skills-building intervention, VIP has the potential to&#xD;
      enhance Veterans' abilities to function effectively in their home environments and to improve&#xD;
      their quality of life and that of their families.&#xD;
