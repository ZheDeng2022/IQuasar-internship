  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a single arm prospective study, aiming at identifying biomarkers of early&#xD;
      response to trastuzumab. It is a prognostic factor study recruiting all consecutive cases of&#xD;
      HER-2 positive breast cancer eligible for a pre-operative treatment by trastuzumab, followed&#xD;
      by breast conserving surgery. The investigators will study the association between the value&#xD;
      of biomarkers measured at diagnosis and the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors&#xD;
      response (partial and complete response) using a logistic regression (main analysis).&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Histologically or confirmed untreated invasive carcinoma of the breast&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous treated invasive breast carcinoma or ductal carcinoma in situ are allowed,&#xD;
             assuming there is no evidence of disease at the moment of the inclusion in the&#xD;
             protocol, and patients are not on any current treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Candidates for breast conserving surgery: patients with a minimum size of 11 mm&#xD;
             measured by breast US. Bilateral and multifocal tumors are allowed, assuming the&#xD;
             biopsies pre- and post-treatment are performed in the same target lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HER2-positive (defined as either immunohistochemistry [immuno-histochemistry ] 3+ or&#xD;
             in situ hybridization [ISH] positive) as assessed by local laboratory on primary tumor&#xD;
             (ISH positivity is defined as a ratio of 2.2 or greater for the number of HER2 gene&#xD;
             copies to the number of signals for abnormality on chromosome 17 (CEP17), or for&#xD;
             single probe tests, a HER2 gene count greater than 4) and/or by PCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No evidence of metastatic disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0/1.&#xD;

             contraception during and for at least 6 months post-treatment.&#xD;
