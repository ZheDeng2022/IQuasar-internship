    <textblock>
      This research study is a Pilot study (a small preliminary study to assess the feasibility of&#xD;
      a larger, more in depth study involving a new test or procedure) and is being done to&#xD;
      evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of PET/MRI in the evaluation of cancer. PET/MRI is a&#xD;
      FDA approved technology that is currently being studied to assess its accuracy and utility in&#xD;
      the diagnosis and management of a variety of diseases and patient populations. The focus of&#xD;
      this particular study will be to compare the performance of PET/MRI in its ability to detect&#xD;
      and characterize cancerous tumors using positron emission topography and computed tomography&#xD;
      (PET/CT) as a reference standard.&#xD;

      If you agree to participate in this study you will be asked to fill out a screening&#xD;
      questionnaire to determine if you can participate. No additional screening tests or&#xD;
      procedures will be necessary prior to your participation in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the screening questionnaire shows that you are eligible to participate in the research&#xD;
      study, you will be scheduled to undergo your PET/MRI in conjunction with your PET/CT. If you&#xD;
      do not meet the eligibility criteria, you will not be able to participate in this research&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After th screening procedures confirm that you are eligible to participate in the research&#xD;
      study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. You will schedule your PET/CT examination with the MGH radiology department according to&#xD;
           the orders and instructions of your oncologist (cancer doctor)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study personnel will coordinate the scheduling of your PET/MRI examination to coincide&#xD;
           with date and time of your PET/CT examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Following the performance of your PET/CT examination you will be transported (with your&#xD;
           accompanying family member(s)) to the Charlestown Navy Yard MGH imaging facility where&#xD;
           you will undergo your PET/MRI examination. No additional dose of radioactive tracer (a&#xD;
           substance which is labeled with a radioactive molecule that can be tracked within your&#xD;
           body based on the radiation it emits) will be given as part of your PET/MRI examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The PET/MRI will take up to 60 minutes to complete and after it is completed you will be&#xD;
           free to go&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The PET/MRI images will be interpreted by physicians (trained radiologists) as part of&#xD;
           the study analysis; however no report of the findings will be made available to you. You&#xD;
           will have access to the results of the PET/CT examination as you would any other&#xD;
           clinical imaging examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. If you are willing, with each subsequent PET/CT examination you undergo while enrolled&#xD;
           in the study, you will also undergo a PET/MRI examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. The study will last for 12 months, after which time you will no longer be enrolled&#xD;
