      DESERVE is a discharge education study using health workers to enroll and randomly assign 800&#xD;
      subjects diagnosed with TIA, or mild stroke to either risk factor education or usual care.&#xD;
      Those patients assigned to education will receive stroke preparedness education plus risk&#xD;
      factor reduction education, and help accessing follow up care with health workers. Those&#xD;
      patients assigned to usual care will receive written stroke preparedness education. This&#xD;
      protocol will evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention to reduce blood pressure, and&#xD;
      individual stroke risk factors and future stroke risk.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke and its risk factors disproportionately affect minority populations, and secondary&#xD;
      stroke prevention programs have had relatively little success. TIA and mild stroke patients&#xD;
      with few after-affects also stay in the hospital for a shorter period of time, and leave&#xD;
      without enough information about their risk for another stroke. Additionally, mild stroke and&#xD;
      TIA patients often do not follow-up with neurologists after they leave the hospital. DESERVE&#xD;
      is a discharge education study using health workers to enroll and randomly assign 800&#xD;
      subjects from MSSM, MSSM Queens and CUMC diagnosed with Transient Ischemic attack (TIA ),&#xD;
      mild Ischemic stroke (IS) or mild Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ICH) to either risk factor&#xD;
      education or usual care. Those patients assigned to education will receive education on&#xD;
      stroke preparedness education plus risk factor reduction education, and help accessing follow&#xD;
      up care with health workers. This education includes a power point presentation and a&#xD;
      patient-paced workbook and video on Risk perception, Medication Adherence, and&#xD;
      Patient-Physician Communication. To target the most appropriate mild IS/ICH and TIA survivors&#xD;
      for participation in this proposal, we will focus on survivors with mild stroke and TIA,&#xD;
      excluding those whose stroke deficits are severe enough to warrant discharge to a nursing&#xD;
      home or to require 24-hour care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those patients assigned to usual care will receive written stroke preparedness education.&#xD;
      This protocol will evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention to reduce blood pressure,&#xD;
      and individual stroke risk factors and future stroke risk. Additionally, we will evaluate the&#xD;
      ability of the these strategies to conduct education to affect positive change in taking&#xD;
      medications as directed, stroke knowledge 6 months and 12 months after hospital admission,&#xD;
      attendance at follow-up health care appointments, and cost-effectiveness. After 1 year&#xD;
      participants will be followed quarterly for up to 3 years to track events.&#xD;
