      The purpose of the APBI Proton Therapy study is to examine the feasibility, side effects, and&#xD;
      clinical efficacy of using proton therapy on only the tumor bed of women being treated for&#xD;
      breast cancer after surgical removal of malignancy (as opposed to whole breast treatment).&#xD;
      The study's aim is to establish the effects of this type of therapy as it compares to both&#xD;
      traditional radiation and whole breast treatment therapies. In order to be eligible, the&#xD;
      patient must be a female older than 50 with either invasive ductal, medullary, papillary,&#xD;
      colloid (mucinous) or tubular histologies of stage IA-IIA breast cancer, ECOG performance&#xD;
      status of 0-2, have margins of greater than or equal to 2mm, be node negative or have only&#xD;
      microscopic node disease, have estrogen- or progesterone-positive breast cancer, and other&#xD;
      eligibility criteria must be met that is more detailed to describe herein.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of invasive or non-invasive breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Invasive ductal, medullary, papillary, colloid (mucinous) or tubular histologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AJCC T1 or T2; N0 or N1mic; Stage IA-IIA breast cancer or AJCC TIS (Stage 0) ductal&#xD;
             carcinoma in situ without invasion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Gross disease must be unifocal with pathologic (invasive and/or DCIS) tumor size 3 cm&#xD;
             or less. (Patients with microscopic multifocality are eligible as long as total&#xD;
             pathological size is 3 cm or less).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Estrogen and/or progesterone receptor positive invasive breast cancer. DCIS stage 0&#xD;
             does not require receptor testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No evidence of distant metastatic disease as documented by history and physical&#xD;
             examination (radiographic staging only to be performed as indicated by symptoms or&#xD;
             physical findings.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have an ECOG Performance Status of 0, 1 or 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 50.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be able to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have undergone breast-conserving surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All tumors (invasive and non-invasive disease) must be excised with a minimum margin&#xD;
             width of ≥ 2 mm. Re-excision of surgical margins is permitted. Focally close (&lt;2 mm)&#xD;
             or positive (tumor cells at the inked edge of the specimen) margins determined to be&#xD;
             at an anatomic boundary of resection by the surgeon, such as posterior fascia for&#xD;
             posterior margins or skin for anterior margins, are also acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with invasive breast cancer must be node-negative (N0) or have only&#xD;
             microscopic disease (≤2mm) in the nodes (N1mi). Patients with Stage IA - IIA are&#xD;
             required to have axillary staging but it will not be done for patients with Stage 0&#xD;
             DCIS. Options for axillary staging include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Negative sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB)&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Level I-II axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) (6 or more nodes removed).&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Positive SLNB followed by completion ALND (6 or more nodes removed).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients presenting with abnormal microcalcifications on a screening mammogram must&#xD;
             have radiographically confirmed excision of the suspicious microcalcifications, either&#xD;
             by specimen radiograph or post-biopsy mammograms.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient must be enrolled on the study within 50 days following the last surgery&#xD;
             for breast cancer (lumpectomy, re-excision of margins, or axillary staging procedure).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The target lumpectomy cavity must be clearly delineated and the target lumpectomy&#xD;
             cavity/whole breast reference volume must be ≤ 30% based on the&#xD;
             postoperative/pre-enrollment CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have bilateral mammogram and/or breast MRI within 3 months of diagnosis&#xD;
             of their breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CBC/differential obtained within 3 months prior to registration on study, with&#xD;
             adequate bone marrow function defined as follows: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥&#xD;
             1,800 cells/mm3; Platelets ≥ 75,000 cells/mm3; Hemoglobin ≥ 8.0 g/dl (Note: The use of&#xD;
             transfusion or other intervention to achieve Hgb ≥ 8.0 g/dl is acceptable).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with synchronous bilateral breast cancers who will be treated with&#xD;
             radiotherapy to each breast are eligible, provided such treatment can be performed in&#xD;
             a manner that avoids overlap between treatment fields. Both sides may be treated with&#xD;
             APBI if the pathologic eligibility criteria are met for both tumors, or only one side&#xD;
             may be treated with APBI if the criteria are met for only one tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of prior breast cancer in the opposite breast are eligible as&#xD;
             long as treatment can be performed without overlapping any prior RT fields.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of prior breast cancer in the ipsilateral breast treated with&#xD;
             lumpectomy alone (no RT) are eligible as long as the other entry criteria for this&#xD;
             study are met.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of non-breast malignancies are eligible as long as they have&#xD;
             not received prior radiotherapy to the thoracic region, and have a greater than 2 year&#xD;
             interval without evidence of recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential must be non-pregnant and non-lactating and willing to&#xD;
             exercise an effective form of birth control during radiation therapy (e.g. oral&#xD;
             contraceptive, IUD, condoms or other barrier methods etc.). Hysterectomy or menopause&#xD;
             must be clinically documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must provide study-specific informed consent prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male breast cancer&#xD;

             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any non-axillary sentinel node(s) positive. (Note that intramammary nodes are staged&#xD;
             as axillary nodes).&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Palpable or radiographically suspicious ipsilateral or contralateral axillary,&#xD;
             supraclavicular, infraclavicular, or internal mammary nodes, unless there is&#xD;
             histological confirmation that these nodes are negative for tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Suspicious microcalcifications, densities, or palpable abnormalities (in the&#xD;

             pathological evaluation. A focally positive margin determined to be at an anatomic&#xD;
             boundary of resection by the surgeon, such as posterior fascia for posterior margins&#xD;
             and skin for anterior margins, is also acceptable. If surgical margins are rendered&#xD;
             free of disease by re-excision, the patient is eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Breast implants. (Patients who have implants removed are eligible).&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Psychiatric or addictive disorders or other conditions that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
