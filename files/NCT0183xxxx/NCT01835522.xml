      The goal of this study is to survey patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia to determine&#xD;
      if there is a relationship between self-reported sexual function and treatment with&#xD;
      antipsychotic medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: 1. Patients on typical antipsychotics will rate their sexual function as lower&#xD;
      than those on atypical agents. 2. Patients on multiple antipsychotics will rate their sexual&#xD;
      function as lower than those on a single agent.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVE The goal of this study is to survey patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia to&#xD;
      determine if there is a relationship between self-reported sexual function and treatment with&#xD;
      antipsychotic medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE Schizophrenia The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental&#xD;
      Disorders (4th Edition) classifies Schizophrenia as an AXIS I disorder with psychosis as the&#xD;
      prominent aspect of its presentation. The essential features of Schizophrenia are a mixture&#xD;
      of characteristic signs and symptoms that have been present for a significant portion of time&#xD;
      during a 1-month period, with some signs of the disorder persisting for at least 6 months,&#xD;
      and are associated with significant social or occupational dysfunction. Characteristic&#xD;
      symptoms include delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, grossly disorganized or&#xD;
      catatonic behavior, and negative symptoms, such as flattening of affect, alogia, and/or&#xD;
      avolition. The prevalence of schizophrenia has been estimated in the range of 0.5%-1.5%, and&#xD;
      has been observed in all societies and geographical areas, and incidence and prevalence rates&#xD;
      are roughly equal worldwide. The median age of onset is typically between late-teens and&#xD;
      early 30s, although is most commonly diagnosed in a person's 20s. The course may be variable.&#xD;
      Some patients experience exacerbations and remissions, whereas other patients remain&#xD;
      chronically ill, some stable, others displaying progressive worsening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antipsychotic Medication Two major classes of medications are used to treat Schizophrenia and&#xD;
      other psychotic disorders, dopamine receptor antagonists (typical antipsychotics) and&#xD;
      serotonin-dopamine antagonists (atypical antipsychotics). While both classes are efficacious,&#xD;
      the atypicals are associated with fewer neurological adverse effects, and are effective&#xD;
      against a broader range of psychotic symptoms. Most dopamine receptor antagonists have&#xD;
      significant effects on other types of receptors, including adrenergic, cholinergic, and&#xD;
      histaminergic receptors. Effects on sexual function are mediated primarily through the&#xD;
      resulting imbalances in adrenergic and cholinergic activities, decreases in catecholamine&#xD;
      activity, and endocrine effects. Blockade of the dopamine receptors in the tuberoinfundibular&#xD;
      tract results in the increased secretion of prolactin, which can result in breast&#xD;
      enlargement, galactorrhea, impotence in men, and amenorrhea and inhibited orgasm in women.&#xD;
      The incidence of these effects is believed to be significantly underestimated. Up to 50% of&#xD;
      men taking dopamine blockers may experience ejaculatory and erectile dysfunction. Both men&#xD;
      and women can experience anorgasmia and decreased libido.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Studies Sexual dysfunction is prevalent among psychiatric patients in general, and&#xD;
      may be related to both psychopathology and pharmacotherapy. There have been many studies that&#xD;
      highlight the problems with sexual functioning experienced by patients with schizophrenia.&#xD;
      One study which used a self-completed gender-specific questionnaire revealed that 82% of men&#xD;
      and 96% of women with schizophrenia reported at least one sexual dysfunction. As unwanted&#xD;
      side effects often play the most significant role in medication non-compliance, on-going&#xD;
      research in these areas remains necessary. A number of studies have addressed the issue of&#xD;
      sexual function and schizophrenia. One study found that patients with untreated schizophrenia&#xD;
      exhibit decreased sexual desire. Treatment with neuroleptics was associated with restoration&#xD;
      of sexual desire; however, it created erectile, orgasmic, and sexual satisfaction problems.&#xD;
      It was clear that more research was needed. Multiple studies have been conducted which have&#xD;
      shown that antipsychotic medications, both typicals and atypicals, contribute to alterations&#xD;
      in prolactin levels. Some studies were able to correlate changes in prolactin levels to&#xD;
      problems with sexual function, however, other studies have shown that while antipsychotics do&#xD;
      alter prolactin levels, they are not always specifically correlated to improvements in sexual&#xD;
      side effects or self-reported sexual dysfunction. However, the majority of the aforementioned&#xD;
      studies focused solely on laboratory markers (prolactin and other reproductive hormones),&#xD;
      have compared only one drug to another, and/or studied men only. The majority of these&#xD;
      studies that did use a self-report measure of sexual dysfunction used the Arizona Sexual&#xD;
      Experience Scale, a 5 item scale, which may not be inclusive enough to fully assess the full&#xD;
      scope of sexual dysfunction. One study, similar in design to this proposed study, did compare&#xD;
      multiple agents in both men and women, used the CSFQ for assessment of sexual function and&#xD;
      controlled for severity of illness. The study found that high rates of sexual impairment were&#xD;
      found in both male and female patients. For males, higher scores on the PANSS-positive&#xD;
      subscale were associated with a lower frequency of sexual activity. For females, higher&#xD;
      scores on the PANSS - positive subscale and PANSS- general psychopathology subscale were&#xD;
      significantly associated with more difficulty in both sexual arousal and orgasm.&#xD;
      Interestingly, no significant differences were found between medication groups. However, of&#xD;
      the 124 patients enrolled in the study, only 69% (84 subjects) completed at least part of the&#xD;
      CSFQ assessment. Meaning even less completed the entire questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GOAL AND HYPOTHESES The current study aims to study the relationship between self-reported&#xD;
      sexual dysfunction in both men and women diagnosed with schizophrenia, treatment with&#xD;
      antipsychotic medication, and disease severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: 1. Patients on typical antipsychotics will rate their sexual function as lower&#xD;
      than those on atypical agents. 2. Patients on multiple antipsychotics will rate their sexual&#xD;
      function as lower than those on a single agent.&#xD;

    <description>Patient's level of sexual functioning will be measured at the time of assessment. Two different scales will be used depending on the gender of the patient.&#xD;
IIEF (International Index of Erectile Function Questionnaire for men) will be used for men. This 15-item questionnaire is a brief, multidimensional instrument for assessing the key dimensions of sexual function in men. It assesses male function and quality of life.&#xD;
FSFI (Female Sexual Function Index) will be used for women. This 19-item questionnaire is a brief, multidimensional self-report instrument for assessing the key dimensions of sexual function in women. It assesses female function and quality of life.</description>
