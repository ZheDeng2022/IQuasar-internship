      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of cabozantinib-s-malate when given&#xD;
      together with vemurafenib in treating patients with solid tumors or melanoma that is&#xD;
      metastatic or that cannot be removed by surgery. Cabozantinib-s-malate and vemurafenib may&#xD;
      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine a tolerable dose of XL184 (cabozantinib-s-malate) in combination with&#xD;
      vemurafenib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) per Response&#xD;
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the progression-free survival (PFS). III. To determine the response rate&#xD;
      according to the molecular phenotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of cabozantinib-s-malate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive cabozantinib-s-malate orally (PO) once daily (QD) and vemurafenib PO twice&#xD;
      daily (BID) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression&#xD;
      or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.&#xD;
