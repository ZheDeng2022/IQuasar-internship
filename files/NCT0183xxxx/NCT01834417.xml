    <textblock>
      Analysis of stored seat-pressures in SCI patients during a 4-week use of an on-board device.&#xD;
      During this period, patients write in an agenda noteworthy events that could occur while&#xD;
      they're using their wheelchair. A control is done every week and the device can be changed&#xD;
      until it is returned at the end of the study period.&#xD;
