  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will document the efficacy of a behavioral intervention for Processing Speed&#xD;
      (PS) in Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Speed of Processing Training (SPT), which has been&#xD;
      successful used in the aging population in several studies. This study will (1) apply a&#xD;
      treatment protocol for PS impairments, well-validated in aging, to persons with MS with&#xD;
      impaired PS, and document its efficacy on standard neuropsychological (NP) tests (2) assess&#xD;
      the effectiveness of the intervention utilizing global measures of daily life, including an&#xD;
      objective measure (TIADL) (3) examine the long term impact of SPT. This study is unique in&#xD;
      that it will be the first to evaluate the efficacy of a highly-manualized structured&#xD;
      behavioral treatment for processing speed deficits in persons with MS utilizing the optimal&#xD;
      methodology for carrying out such studies, a randomized clinical trial. Given the prevalence&#xD;
      of PS deficits in the MS population and the significant impact such deficits have on everyday&#xD;
      functioning, public safety, and overall quality of life, the identification of an effective&#xD;
      intervention for PS deficits in MS could have a profound impact on the population and society&#xD;
      as a whole.&#xD;

    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Speed of Processing Training</intervention_name>
    <description>SPT involves trainer-guided practice of computer-based exercises, including Target Detection (indicating presence or absence of targets, identifying targets, etc.) and Discrimination and Localization (performing same/ different discriminations of targets presented very quickly and followed by a masking pattern) 10, 19, 84. Display speed, ranging from 17 to 500 ms, is the primary manipulation during training, which increases task demands and thus demands on PS itself.</description>
