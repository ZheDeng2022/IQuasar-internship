      The absence of methodologically, prospectively and retrospectively collected information on&#xD;
      the use of the Quadrilateral Surface Plate (QSP) in the given indication requires a&#xD;
      multicenter approach. Using a registry to get more information about the effectiveness and&#xD;
      possible benefits or complications during the surgery and during the post-operative treatment&#xD;
      is adequate and necessary to get new insights to the use of the Quadrilateral Surface Plate.&#xD;

      This registry includes six visits at which data is collected form the patinet (pre-op,&#xD;
      post-op, 6 weeks FU, 3 months FU, 6 months FU and 12 months FU). Patients can be inlucded&#xD;
      prospectively or retrospectively. If properatively recruited patients complete two&#xD;
      questionnaires (EQ5D and Merle d'Aubigné) at their preoperative visits. These questionnaires&#xD;
      are repeated after 6 and 12 months. Surgeons report about the success of the surgical&#xD;
      procedure in a specifically designed questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the whole study period, adverse events related to the implant or surgery are collected&#xD;
      as well as x-rays and CT (as per standard of care).&#xD;

        The increasing number of acetabular fractures in elderly individuals with osteoporosis has&#xD;
        added new technical challenges to surgical management. A common group of fracture patterns&#xD;
        in this population is the anterior wall or column often with an associated posterior&#xD;
        hemitransverse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        These injuries frequently also include quadrilateral surface comminution which can make&#xD;
        both reduction and stabilization more difficult. The 3.5 mm quadrilateral surface plate was&#xD;
        developed to provide a more effective way to deal with these issues, for example, a way to&#xD;
        deal with the quadrilateral surface enbloc for reduction, allowing buttress stabilization,&#xD;
        which is independent of bone density.&#xD;
