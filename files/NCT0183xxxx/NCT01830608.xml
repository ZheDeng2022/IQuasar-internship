  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in the Western&#xD;
      World. The etiology and pathogenesis of this disease remain largely unknown. In Europe about&#xD;
      two million people suffer from AMD. According to the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS)&#xD;
      the disease can be classified into early, intermediate and late. Early age-related macular&#xD;
      degeneration is characterized by the presence of small or medium-sized drusen and/or retinal&#xD;
      pigmentary abnormalities. Intermediate age-related macular degeneration is characterized by&#xD;
      large drusen or numerous medium-size drusen and/or geographic atrophy not extending to the&#xD;
      center of the macula. Late age-related macular degeneration can be either atrophic with&#xD;
      extension to the macula or neovascular. The late form of the disease is associated with a&#xD;
      pronounced loss of visual acuity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the recent years several studies focused on risk factors for late AMD and a recent&#xD;
      systematic review and meta-analysis reported risk factors for AMD based on 16 studies in&#xD;
      almost 114000 subjects. Strong and consistent associations with late AMD for found for&#xD;
      increasing age, current cigarette smoking, previous cataract surgery, and a family history of&#xD;
      AMD. Consistent associations between late AMD and higher body mass index, history of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease, hypertension and higher plasma fibrinogen were also found, but the&#xD;
      association was weak. Inconsistent associations were found for gender, ethnicity, diabetes,&#xD;
      iris color, history of cerebrovascular disease, serum total and HDL cholesterol and&#xD;
      triglyceride levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence has also accumulated that other factors influence the risk for AMD. Several genetic&#xD;
      risk factors have been identified in the last years including genes in the alternative&#xD;
      complement pathway and the RMS2/HTRA1 region. In addition, post-hoc analysis of data from the&#xD;
      AREDS study has indicated that reduced intake of the omega-3 free fatty acids&#xD;
      eicosapentaenoic acid and docsahexaenoic acid are associated with the risk of late AMD&#xD;
      thereby supporting previous population based studies. The AREDS study also revealed that&#xD;
      reduced intake of the macular pigment lutein and zeaxanthin may be associated with late AMD,&#xD;
      again supporting previous population-based studies. Finally, 2 small studies indicate that&#xD;
      reduced choroidal blood flow is associated with an increased risk of developing late AMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Less data are available for the progression of early or intermediate AMD and the associated&#xD;
      risk factors. This is at least partially related to the problems in quantifying progression&#xD;
      of drusen size and volume. In the recent years, however, significant efforts have been&#xD;
      achieved in optical coherence tomography (OCT)-based methods for quantifying drusen&#xD;
      progression and drusen volume. Polarization-sensitive OCT is the most promising of these&#xD;
      approaches and will be used to quantify drusen area and volume in the present study.&#xD;
