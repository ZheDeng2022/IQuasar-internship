      Young patients requiring myocardial revascularization are generally considered at low&#xD;
      operative risk, but data on their immediate and late outcome are scarce. The decision-making&#xD;
      process in these young patients is complicated by the potentially aggressive nature of&#xD;
      premature coronary artery disease and their likely long expectancy of life, which expose them&#xD;
      to a significantly higher risk of recurrent coronary events as well as the need of repeat&#xD;
      revascularization. The lack of data on long-term outcome as well as on operative details (in&#xD;
      particular, on the use of arterial grafts) and peri- and postoperative medication prevent any&#xD;
      conclusive results on the durability either of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or of&#xD;
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in these young patients. Furthermore, recent&#xD;
      advances in stents technology as well in peri- and postoperative medical treatment indicate&#xD;
      the need a comparative study to define the baseline characteristics of patients aged &lt; 50&#xD;
      years undergoing either PCI or CABG and to evaluate their current immediate and late outcome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Age is, without any doubt, one of the most important risk factors for adverse events after&#xD;
      any cardiovascular procedure and because of this it is incorporated in all major risk scoring&#xD;
      methods. There is abundant literature dealing with the outcome of elderly patients undergoing&#xD;
      cardiovascular procedures as their operative risk is significantly increased and preoperative&#xD;
      risk assessment is of great importance in the decision-making process of these fragile&#xD;
      patients (1). In the very elderly patients percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is an&#xD;
      attractive treatment method, particularly in those with multiple comorbidities (2). On the&#xD;
      other hand, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) has been shown to be a durable procedure&#xD;
      also among octogenarians (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Young patients requiring myocardial revascularization are generally considered at low&#xD;
      operative risk, but data on their immediate and late outcome are scarce. However, the&#xD;
      decision-making process in these young patients is complicated by the potentially aggressive&#xD;
      nature of premature coronary artery disease and their likely long expectancy of life, which&#xD;
      expose them to a significantly higher risk of recurrent coronary events as well as the need&#xD;
      of repeat revascularization. CABG seems to more durable compared with percutaneous coronary&#xD;
      intervention (3), particularly because of excellent late results with the use arterial grafts&#xD;
      (4). Therefore, young patients with diffuse coronary artery diffuse may likely benefit of&#xD;
      surgical revascularization. However, no formal comparative analysis of these two treatment&#xD;
      methods has been previously performed in this young patient population. Since CABG is a major&#xD;
      procedure with a potential risk of operative mortality and major morbidity, this is an&#xD;
      argument against surgical revascularization, even if recent pooled data showed that it can be&#xD;
      performed with an exceedingly low mortality risk (0.9%) (Biancari et al. submitted, Fig. 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Such a low postoperative mortality rate is similar to that reported by Khawaja et al. (5) in&#xD;
      patients aged ≤ 50 years treated by PCI (0.86%). However, PCI was performed in 41% of these&#xD;
      patients with single vessel coronary artery disease. This is likely to significantly differ&#xD;
      from surgical series (6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only two studies evaluated the outcome after CABG in patients aged &lt; 40 years (7) and &lt; 50&#xD;
      years (8) and estimated a survival rate at 10 years of about 75%. A study by Ellis (9)&#xD;
      addressed survival after PCI in 86 patients aged &lt; 40 years and showed a 10-year survival&#xD;
      rate of about 91%, but a significant number of patients underwent repeat PCI (37%) and/or&#xD;
      CABG (22%). These findings should be viewed in the light of the fact that most of patients&#xD;
      did not have diffuse coronary artery disease (3-vessel disease was present in 11% of&#xD;
      patients) and they were treated about two decades ago. Khawaja et al. (6) reported on 2922&#xD;
      patients aged ≤ 50 years who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention since 1979 and&#xD;
      having a 5-year survival of about 95%. They reported repeat target revascularization rates&#xD;
      ranging from 19% to 27% according to different study periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lack of data on long-term outcome as well as on operative details (in particular, on the&#xD;
      use of arterial grafts) and peri- and postoperative medication prevent any conclusive results&#xD;
      on the durability either of CABG of PCI in these young patients. Furthermore, recent advances&#xD;
      in stents technology as well in peri- and postoperative medical treatment indicate the need a&#xD;
      comparative study to define the baseline characteristics of patients aged &lt; 50 years&#xD;
      undergoing either PCI or CABG and to evaluate their current immediate and late outcome.&#xD;
