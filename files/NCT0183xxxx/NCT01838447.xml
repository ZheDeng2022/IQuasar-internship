    <textblock>
      Our research group has shown that almost all children with congenital heart disease (CHD) are&#xD;
      vitamin D deficient following heart surgery. This work strongly suggests that the vitamin D&#xD;
      intake presently recommended for healthy children, and also given to children with CHD, is&#xD;
      inadequate to prevent vitamin D deficiency following surgery. Unfortunately, there have been&#xD;
      no studies investigating any other vitamin D dose in children with heart disease. Recently, a&#xD;
      higher dose of vitamin D intake has been approved (by the Institute of Medicine and Health&#xD;
      Canada) and recent work on healthy children has shown it to be safe. The objective of this&#xD;
      study is to determine whether this recently approved higher dose of vitamin D can safely&#xD;
      reduce the number of children who are vitamin D deficient following surgery. This dose&#xD;
      evaluation study will also evaluate whether it is possible to perform a large study (across&#xD;
      Canada) to determine whether vitamin D supplementation can improve outcomes following&#xD;
      surgery. It is hypothesized that a daily high dose vitamin D regimen, modeled on the&#xD;
      Institute of Medicine daily upper tolerable intake level (UL), will significantly reduce&#xD;
      vitamin D deficiency following CHD surgery, when compared with usual intake.&#xD;

      1 - INTRODUCTION 1.1 Summary of problem CHD is a common condition with an estimated&#xD;
      prevalence of 1 per 100 in the general population. A significant proportion of these&#xD;
      pediatric patients require one or more corrective surgeries over their lifetime, leading to&#xD;
      15000 procedures per year in North America. Post-operatively, these patients suffer&#xD;
      significant morbidities which may include a pronounced systemic inflammatory response,&#xD;
      coagulopathy, respiratory failure, electrolyte disturbances, arrhythmia, myocardial&#xD;
      dysfunction, kidney failure, infection and endocrine imbalances. Interventions that prevent&#xD;
      or modulate post-operative pathophysiology may prevent illness, speed recovery and decrease&#xD;
      chronic morbidity in this high risk pediatric population. Vitamin D is recognized as a&#xD;
      pleiotropic hormone important for the functioning of multiple organ systems, including those&#xD;
      central to critical illness pathophysiology. Recent research by our group and others has&#xD;
      documented not only that 4 out of every 5 CHD patients have inadequate blood levels of&#xD;
      vitamin D following surgery, but an association between immediate post-operative hormone&#xD;
      levels and clinical course. Altogether, these findings and similar results in adult critical&#xD;
      care and cardiac surgery populations, suggest that optimization of vitamin D status following&#xD;
      CHD repair could lessen inflammation, reduce nosocomial infection and improve cardiac&#xD;
      function. As an inexpensive medication (~$15/month) that is generally regarded as safe,&#xD;
      vitamin D has the potential to be an ideal intervention for improving outcomes following CHD&#xD;
      repair. Clinical trials will be required to determine whether elevation of pre-operative&#xD;
      25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) and prevention of post-operative vitamin D deficiency improves&#xD;
      the health of patients with CHD who require cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 - Gaps in current knowledge regarding vitamin D supplementation in CHD&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current body of knowledge suggests that optimization of vitamin D status prior to and&#xD;
      following CHD repair could improve outcomes through reduced inflammation, fewer nosocomial&#xD;
      infections and improved cardiac function. However, before these findings can be translated&#xD;
      into clinical practice a number of unknowns must be addressed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evidence of benefit from interventional studies - As a unique and under-appreciated&#xD;
           problem, there have been no interventional studies establishing that prevention of&#xD;
           post-operative vitamin D deficiency improves clinical outcomes in CHD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Lack of studies evaluating vitamin D dosing in the CHD population - Attempts to perform&#xD;
           a large randomized control trial (RCT) would be premature as a dosing regimen that&#xD;
           prevents post-operative vitamin D deficiency has not yet been identified. Moreover,&#xD;
           there have been no vitamin D dosing studies or guidelines developed specific to the CHD&#xD;
           population; presently children with CHD receive the same advice regarding&#xD;
           supplementation as healthy children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The safety of vitamin D doses above usual care has not been studied in the CHD&#xD;
           population - Although it is tempting to extrapolate recent safety data from high dose&#xD;
           vitamin D studies on healthy children to the CHD population, this may be inappropriate.&#xD;
           CHD patients have unique metabolic demands, organ dysfunctions, and known and unknown&#xD;
           genetic abnormalities that potentially make them more or less susceptible to vitamin D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To begin addressing these knowledge gaps we will complete a pilot dose evaluation trial with&#xD;
      the goal of identifying a supplementation regimen that safely prevents post-operative vitamin&#xD;
      D deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 - OBJECTIVES AND HYPOTHESIS 2.1 Hypothesis Pre-operative supplementation with a daily high&#xD;
      dose vitamin D regimen, modeled on the Institute of Medicine (IOM) daily upper tolerable&#xD;
      intake level (UL), will significantly reduce vitamin D deficiency following CHD surgery, when&#xD;
      compared with usual intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Study objectives Primary study objective: In pediatric patients with CHD, determine&#xD;
      whether a pre-operative regimen of daily high dose vitamin D results in a significant&#xD;
      reduction in post-operative vitamin D deficiency, when compared with usual care&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary study objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine whether a pre-operative regimen of daily high dose vitamin D, compared with&#xD;
           usual care, results in vitamin D related adverse events (hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine whether a pre-operative regimen of daily high dose vitamin D, compared with&#xD;
           usual care, improves established markers of vitamin D axis functioning (active hormone&#xD;
           levels, cardiac function).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine the barriers and feasibility of an RCT evaluating whether vitamin D&#xD;
           supplementation improves clinical outcomes in children who require CHD surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 - METHODOLOGY 3.1 Study design and rationale - We will perform a pilot double blind&#xD;
      randomized controlled dose evaluation trial comparing the efficacy and safety of two vitamin&#xD;
      D dosing regimens in the prevention of post-operative vitamin D deficiency in children&#xD;
      undergoing surgery for CHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 Proposed supplement doses (Interventions) to be tested and rationale - Treatment groups -&#xD;
      The doses for evaluation have been modelled on the two age specific intake levels recommended&#xD;
      by the IOM. Infants under 6 months of age in the high dose group will receive 600 IU/day more&#xD;
      than the IOM recommended UL, while those between 6 and 12 months will receive 100 IU/day more&#xD;
      than UL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usual care group will receive Adequate Intake (AI) for infants and Recommended Dietary&#xD;
      Allowance (RDA) for children over 1 year. These doses were chosen by IOM to achieve blood&#xD;
      25OHD levels above 50 nmol/L in the majority of the healthy population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High dose group is based on the age-specific UL. These doses were chosen to elevate 25OHD&#xD;
      well above 50 nmol/L, while minimizing risk of vitamin D toxicity (e.g. hypercalcemia,&#xD;
      hypercalciuria).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3 Anticipated pre- and post-operative 25OHD levels in the study arms - Given the 40%&#xD;
      intra-operative decline, pre-operative levels above 90 nmol/L will be required to maintain&#xD;
      post-operative levels above 50 nmol/L (the value at which sufficient substrate to synthesize&#xD;
      the active metabolite is available). The ability of certain vitamin D intake levels to&#xD;
      achieve this pre-operative value can be inferred from recently completed dosing studies on&#xD;
      healthy children level. These studies, including one by co-investigator (Dr. Hope Weiler,&#xD;
      McGill) have shown that usual care dosing for 2 to 3 months will achieve pre-operative levels&#xD;
      of 90 nmol/L in only 40-50%. In contrast, studies evaluating doses approximating our higher&#xD;
      daily intake level (1600 IU/day ) achieved mean 25OHD levels of 130 to 150 nmol/L; suggesting&#xD;
      that 80% of CHD patients could achieve pre-operative levels of 90 nmol/L or above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4 Study design details 3.4.2 Stratification: We anticipate that two months of daily&#xD;
      consumption may be required to achieve target 25OHD levels. Participants will be stratified&#xD;
      into whether or not they are expected to receive at least 8 weeks of study drug prior to&#xD;
      surgery. This stratification should guarantee that an equal number of CHD patients who will&#xD;
      not receive 8 weeks of oral dosing end up in both the high and low dose arms. We will further&#xD;
      stratify by the age (under or over 1 year of age) 3.4.3 Randomization and allocation&#xD;
      concealment: Computer software generated randomization will be performed. Given the expected&#xD;
      recruitment (4 to 5 per month) and potential impact of season on 25OHD randomization will be&#xD;
      performed in blocks (4 within each strata). Only the pharmacy staff will be aware which&#xD;
      patients receive high and low dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4.4 Blinding: We will blind patients, families, investigators, hospital staff, and research&#xD;
      personnel to treatment arm. The two interventions will be indistinguishable (vial, volume,&#xD;
      color, taste, consistency and smell). Only the pharmacist will know the identity of the study&#xD;
      drug administered to a specific patient. Blinding can be broken at the request of the&#xD;
      clinical service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4.5 Co-interventions: The study protocol will not protocolize co-interventions as the study&#xD;
      is single centre and CHEO has protocols or standardized approaches to the common&#xD;
      post-operative complications and adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.5 Study procedures 3.5.1 Recruitment: Potentially eligible study participants will be&#xD;
      identified in the ambulatory clinics (cardiology, cardiovascular) or inpatient wards&#xD;
      (including pediatric intensive care and neonatal intensive care unit). CHD patients&#xD;
      identified as requiring surgery and have or will be referred to the cardiovascular team for&#xD;
      consultation may be provided a patient brochure directly by hospital staff or as part of the&#xD;
      standard information package (mailed to outpatients). Caregivers (and children where&#xD;
      appropriate) will be asked for permission to be approached about study participation by the&#xD;
      research nurse/assistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.5.2 Study drug distribution: Europharm has agreed to provide the study drug in the required&#xD;
      concentrations, prepared in indistinguishable vials for blinding purposes. Pharmacy will&#xD;
      administer study drug (based on randomization, participant age and whether the patient is&#xD;
      breast or formula fed). Infants with CHD assigned to the usual care arm will be given a&#xD;
      placebo (0 IU/mL) as they will receive usual (recommended) vitamin D intake as part of&#xD;
      formula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.5.3 Frequency and duration of follow-up appointments Planned additional study appointments-&#xD;
      There will be no additional appointments planned for study purposes. Patients may require&#xD;
      additional appointments if research tests identify clinically relevant findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned additional study phone calls - Research study staff will call caregivers and&#xD;
      participants (where applicable) every two to four weeks to encourage compliance and provide&#xD;
      education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.5.4 Frequency of biological sample collection and metabolites measured Before initiation of&#xD;
      study drug - Urine - After consent is obtained and the study participant is waiting for the&#xD;
      pharmacy to prepare the study drug we will gather a urine sample for determination of&#xD;
      calcium:creatinine ratios. Where developmentally appropriate the participants will be asked&#xD;
      to provide urine into a container. Urine bags will be placed on younger children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood - Neonates and other study participants (mainly inpatients) requiring surgery within 2&#xD;
      months of diagnosis and enrollment will have blood collected prior to (or within 2 days) of&#xD;
      starting study supplement for determination of 25OHD. These patients will not have blood&#xD;
      collected for research purposes again until they are taken to the operating room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During period of study drug administration - Blood - For those study participants who will&#xD;
      receive study drug for more than 6 months we will measure 25OHD and calcium at the time of&#xD;
      clinically indicated blood-work during regularly scheduled cardiology or cardiovascular&#xD;
      surgery (CVS) clinic appointments At time of standard pre-surgical blood work - All&#xD;
      outpatient participants will have blood collected at the time of standard pre-surgical blood&#xD;
      work in preparation for the operation (two to three weeks prior to surgery). The blood will&#xD;
      be sent to the CHEO laboratory for measurement of 25OHD and ionized calcium. Once completed,&#xD;
      results will be forwarded to safety officer and study investigator (sealed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative biological samples and measurements- Blood - All study participants will have&#xD;
      2 mL of blood collected in the operating room following anesthesia and intubation, but prior&#xD;
      to skin incision and initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass. Blood will also be sent to the&#xD;
      CHEO laboratory for pre-operative ionized calcium determination. Remaining sample will be&#xD;
      aliquoted and stored at -80 degrees Celsius (oC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine - All study participants will have urine collected after insertion of the urinary&#xD;
      catheter. The sample will be sent to the CHEO laboratory for determination of&#xD;
      calcium:creatinine ratio. Study results will not appear on the patient hospital chart, but&#xD;
      will be labeled with the study identification (ID) number and forwarded to the study&#xD;
      investigator and safety officer for review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative biological samples and other study measurements Blood - All study participants&#xD;
      will have 2 mL of blood collected following separation from cardiopulmonary bypass (at&#xD;
      admission to PICU). Further study participants will have 2 mL of blood collected on&#xD;
      post-operative days 1, 3, 5 and 10 in the PICU. Samples will be collected from arterial or&#xD;
      central venous catheters at the time of clinically indicated blood work. If these catheters&#xD;
      have been removed, blood will be collected at the time of clinically indicated venipuncture.&#xD;
      If patients are discharged to the ward before the day 10 research sample is collected a&#xD;
      discharge sample will be collected at the time of discharge and no further research blood&#xD;
      will be gathered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine - All study participants will have urine collected from the urinary catheter on the&#xD;
      first post-operative day. The samples will be sent to the CHEO laboratory for determination&#xD;
      of calcium and creatine concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiography - A comprehensive exam will be performed immediately post-operatively&#xD;
      (standard of care) and on the first post-operative day by a trained technician or pediatric&#xD;
      cardiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Case report form&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Questionnaire - On the day of surgery the research coordinator will collect the&#xD;
           participant dairies and unused study supplement. Information will also be collected on&#xD;
           prescribed medications, nutrition, and additional supplement use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Operative details - The research assistant will extract detailed operative information,&#xD;
           including: cardiac lesion type, surgery performed, Risk Adjusted Congenital Heart&#xD;
           Surgery (RACHS) score, total fluid intake and output, blood product and fluid&#xD;
           administration and loss, hypothermia, need for deep hypothermic circulatory arrest&#xD;
           (duration), aortic cross clamp times, cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) circuit volumes, CPB&#xD;
           circuit constituents, CPB time, occurrence of intraoperative hyper or hypocalcemia,&#xD;
           administration of parenteral calcium, need for catecholamines following separation from&#xD;
           CPB, occurrence of intra-operative arrhythmias.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. PICU course - Clinically relevant information on clinical course and organ dysfunction&#xD;
           will be collected, including: death, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), PRISM&#xD;
           illness severity, cardiovascular dysfunction (fluid bolus requirements,&#xD;
           inotrope/catecholamine use, arrhythmia), renal dysfunction (urine output, creatinine&#xD;
           measurements, need for dialysis), hypocalcemia and calcium administration, duration of&#xD;
           mechanical ventilation and duration of PICU stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.5.5 Other metabolites and measurements on research specimens Remaining research blood will&#xD;
      be used for research purposes only (measurement of antimicrobial peptides, cytokines,&#xD;
      nutritional markers).&#xD;
&#xD;
      4 -STUDY SAFETY MEASURES 4.1 Background on vitamin D safety and toxicity Acute vitamin D&#xD;
      toxicity is characterized by hypercalcemia or hypercalciuria, with the classic symptoms&#xD;
      directly attributable to these abnormalities. Acute toxicity is a rare event that occurs in&#xD;
      the context of overdose (accidental or prescribed megadoses in the range of 300,000-600,000&#xD;
      IU). The risk of acute vitamin D toxicity with this study is remote as it would require&#xD;
      consumption of more than one vial of study drug to meet doses (~150,000 IU) and blood 25OHD&#xD;
      levels known to cause toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin D toxicity due to genetic susceptibility - Concern about the safety of daily high&#xD;
      dose vitamin D supplementation dates back to the 1950's when a rise in idiopathic infantile&#xD;
      hypercalcemia (IIH) coincided with the implementation of higher daily vitamin D intake (~4000&#xD;
      IU/day). This small epidemic lead to a decrease in recommended daily vitamin D intake to&#xD;
      levels that could prevent rickets and hypocalcemic seizures (400 IU/day). It is now thought&#xD;
      that most cases of IIH are due to rare genetic conditions (1:10000) that increase&#xD;
      susceptibility to vitamin D. Of these, patients with William's syndrome can have CHD as part&#xD;
      of the constellation of symptoms and the proposed project will exclude these individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lack of subacute/chronic toxicity with IOM high dose in healthy children - Given recent&#xD;
      suggestions that higher vitamin D levels might protect against non-bone disease, the safety&#xD;
      of vitamin D doses above usual care (400-600 IU/day) has been reconsidered. To address this&#xD;
      question the American and Canadian governments had the IOM assemble a committee of experts to&#xD;
      provide recommendations based upon a comprehensive review of literature. In the final IOM&#xD;
      report an age specific daily upper tolerable intake level was provided that was intended to&#xD;
      safely elevate 25OHD levels while avoiding toxicity. Recently two blinded RCTs have shown&#xD;
      that vitamin D supplementation at and slightly above the IOM daily upper tolerable intake&#xD;
      level does not cause hypercalcemia or hypercalcuria. It is important to acknowledge that the&#xD;
      IOM recommendations are for healthy children and may not be applicable to children with CHD&#xD;
      4.2 Safety measures and clinically relevant research findings Pre-surgical 25OHD and ionized&#xD;
      calcium levels -&#xD;
&#xD;
      To avoid vitamin D overdose, hypercalcemia and side effects we have selected a supplement&#xD;
      level recently proven to be safe in healthy children and will target the period of high dose&#xD;
      supplementation to 6 months, and no more than 12 months. Further, to avoid excessive vitamin&#xD;
      D levels at time of surgery we will measure 25OHD and ionized calcium with the pre-surgical&#xD;
      blood work (~3 weeks prior to surgery for outpatients who will receive many months of&#xD;
      supplementation). These values will be determined through the CHEO laboratory with results&#xD;
      forwarded to the study investigator and safety officer. Study participants with elevated&#xD;
      blood calcium and/or vitamin D levels will be identified and contacted by the safety officer.&#xD;
      Ionized calcium thresholds have been established. For 25OHD, although 500 nmol/L is generally&#xD;
      considered the definitive toxicity threshold, we have chosen to intervene with 25OHD levels&#xD;
      above 200 nmol/L as this value is supraphysiological and exceeds our study goal. The&#xD;
      following details the actions that will be taken with abnormal values:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. For 25OHD above 200 nmol/L with evidence of hypercalcemia (vitamin D toxicity):&#xD;
           discontinue study drug immediately, repeat the values (fasting), and refer to&#xD;
           endocrinology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. For 25OHD above 200 nmol/L without hypercalcemia: study drug will be reduced by 50% (c)&#xD;
           For 25OHD above 250 nmol/L, without hypercalcemia: study drug will be discontinued (d)&#xD;
           For hypercalcemia with 25OHD under 200 nmol/L: repeat the bloodwork (fasting) and refer&#xD;
           to endocrinology Pre-surgical 25OHD and ionized calcium levels during period of study&#xD;
           drug administration. For patients who will receive more than 6 months of study drug&#xD;
           prior to surgery we will determine blood 25OHD and ionized calcium at the time of&#xD;
           routine bloodwork at CVS and cardiology appointments (or hospitalizations)&#xD;
           Post-operative blood calcium levels. Will be determined at multiple times following&#xD;
           cardiac surgery and represents standard of care. Both hypo and hypercalcemia will be&#xD;
           managed by the clinical team as required. Study participants with persistently elevated&#xD;
           blood calcium levels (for more than two days, not explained by intravenous calcium&#xD;
           administration) will be referred to endocrinology.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Post-treatment, pre-operative elevated urine calcium:creatinine ratios - As prolonged&#xD;
           exposure to hypercalciuria (&gt; 3 months) could theoretically cause nephrocalcinosis we&#xD;
           will have ultrasounds performed prior to hospital discharge on all patients with&#xD;
           elevated immediate pre-operative urine calcium to creatinine ratios. Any study&#xD;
           participant with nephrocalcinosis will be referred to the CHEO nephrology service for&#xD;
           further assessment. It is important to note that with the exception of a decrease in&#xD;
           vitamin D dose to minimal daily intake (will occur by default in all patients) there&#xD;
           would be no additional treatment for nephrocalcinosis at this time. Dr. Geier has&#xD;
           offered to see these patients at no expense.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Post-operative elevated urine calcium:creatinine ratios - Urine calcium to creatinine&#xD;
           ratios are not measured as part of standard medical care. Further no research is&#xD;
           available to indicate the impact of CHD and operative procedures on acute post-surgical&#xD;
           calcium excretion or long-term nephrocalcinosis risk. However, as this patient&#xD;
           population is followed closely and nephrocalcinosis is rarely reported following CHD&#xD;
           surgery (only one case series of 3 in the literature) it does not appear that these&#xD;
           patients are at significant risk for nephrocalcinosis. However, the addition of higher&#xD;
           doses of vitamin D could predispose to nephrocalcinosis given concurrent acute illness,&#xD;
           immobilization and diuretic use. Therefore any patient with an elevated calcium:&#xD;
           creatinine ratio (collected on the first post-operative day) will be referred to&#xD;
           nephrology service. Again, Dr. Geier has offered to consult on these patients; he will&#xD;
           repeat the calcium: creatinine ratio and decide upon further investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants that have study drug discontinued or decreased will be retained in the&#xD;
           study, have peri-operative biological samples collected as outlined, and will be&#xD;
           included in the analysis using intention to treat methodology.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.3 Study results of unclear clinical relevance 4.3.1 Post-operative vitamin D Low risk&#xD;
           of elevated post-operative vitamin D - As described, vitamin D levels will be checked 2&#xD;
           to 3 weeks prior to surgery. For patients with even moderate elevations in 25OHD (above&#xD;
           200 nmol/L) study drug intake will be modified to ensure vitamin D levels do not exceed&#xD;
           250 nmol/L in any individual at the time of surgery. Given these pre-operative safety&#xD;
           measures and the known 40% intraoperative drop, we anticipate that no study participant&#xD;
           will have a vitamin D level above 250 nmol/L post-operatively. Even if a participant was&#xD;
           to have unexpectedly high 25OHD value, no treatment would be initiated without evidence&#xD;
           of hypercalcemia (note - patients with persistent post-operative hypercalcemia would be&#xD;
           referred to endocrinology as outlined in section 4.1). Further, the management plan for&#xD;
           a post-operative patient with 25OHD in excess of 200 nmol/L would be to discontinue high&#xD;
           dose study supplement. As all study participants will discontinue study drug at time of&#xD;
           surgery, any patient with elevated 25OHD will already be receiving the appropriate&#xD;
           management.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Unclear relevance of low post-operative Vitamin D - Observational studies suggest that&#xD;
           low post-operative vitamin D contributes to a more protracted clinical course. However,&#xD;
           it is presently unclear whether or how to acutely increase 25OHD in post-operative CHD&#xD;
           patients as there is no intravenous form and the safety of single enteral megadoses of&#xD;
           vitamin D (&gt;100,000 IU) has not been proven in any diseased pediatric population. With&#xD;
           the exception of those participants with endocrinology consults initiated (for&#xD;
           hypercalcemia) all patients will be encouraged to continue with standard vitamin D&#xD;
           supplementation following surgery (infants 400 IU, children 600 IU). This intake will&#xD;
           gradually restore 25OHD above 50 nmol/L over a 2 to 3 month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Given the above rationale there would be no benefit in determining 25OHD values at the&#xD;
           time of active patient care. For this reason, immediate pre and post-operative blood&#xD;
           will be collected and stored at -80 oC for batch determination of vitamin D metabolites.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.3.2 Elevated urine calcium:creatinine Background - There is a theoretical increased&#xD;
           risk of hypercalciuria leading to nephrocalcinosis with high dose vitamin D&#xD;
           supplementation. Although frequently discussed in the literature the association between&#xD;
           vitamin D supplementation and nephrocalcinosis appears limited to two rare&#xD;
           circumstances: a rare genetic disorder called vitamin D resistant rickets and cumulative&#xD;
           vitamin D intake above 600,000 (over a few days or month).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Pre-treatment urine calcium/creatinine ratios - Given the absence of good evidence&#xD;
           supporting a link between low to moderate dose daily enteral vitamin D intake and&#xD;
           hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis we have decided not to exclude patients from the&#xD;
           study based on their pre-treatment urine calcium to creatinine ratio. The pretreatment&#xD;
           values will be reported in the two treatment groups and will be used to determine&#xD;
           whether CHD patients with high initial values are more likely to have elevated&#xD;
           calcium:creatinine ratios at the time of surgery and/or evidence of nephrocalcinosis.&#xD;
           This finding would result in exclusion of these patients from the subsequent multicenter&#xD;
           phase III study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.4 Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) A DSMB will be set up for this trial. Study&#xD;
           results will be analyzed after half of the participants (n=32) have completed all study&#xD;
           procedures, including assay for 25OHD, ionized calcium and urine calcium:creatinine&#xD;
           ratios. With the biochemistry and information on clinical adverse events the DSMB will&#xD;
           determine whether it is safe to continue the pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5 - ETHICAL REVIEW AND CONSIDERATIONS The proposed trial has been reviewed by the&#xD;
           Research Ethics Board at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario. Informed consent&#xD;
           will be obtained from all parents and from patients (assent, where applicable). All&#xD;
           participation will be entirely voluntary and parents/children will be informed that they&#xD;
           are free to refuse to participate or withdraw consent at any time during the course of&#xD;
           the study without jeopardizing the excellence of the care they receive by the&#xD;
           cardiovascular surgery program at CHEO. All information will be kept confidential, will&#xD;
           be accessible only by the study personnel and treating team, and will not be released to&#xD;
           a third party.&#xD;
&#xD;
           6 - SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION Primary objective - Based on our observational studies and&#xD;
           findings from recent dose evaluation studies on healthy children we estimate that 40% of&#xD;
           the usual care arm will have post-operative 25OHD levels above 50 nmol/L. Based on the&#xD;
           25OHD levels achieved with 1600 IU/day in recent studies on approximate IOM high dose in&#xD;
           healthy children we anticipate that 80% of the high dose arm will have post-operative&#xD;
           levels above 50 nmol/L. Therefore group sample sizes of 28 in both treatment arms will&#xD;
           be required to achieve 80% power to detect a difference between the group proportions of&#xD;
           0.40. The test statistic used is the two-sided Fisher's exact test and the significance&#xD;
           level of the test was targeted at 0.05. Assuming a 10% drop out rate, 62 patients&#xD;
           (total) will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Comments on power for evaluating vitamin D related adverse outcomes - (1) Hypercalcemia&#xD;
           - Our observational study (n=58) identified no cases of pre-operative or immediate&#xD;
           post-operative hypercalcemia. With a baseline rate in the usual care arm between 0 and&#xD;
           10% our sample size would be sufficient to show a statistically significant difference&#xD;
           between groups if the rate in the high dose arm exceeded 30%. (2) Hypercalciuria -&#xD;
           Information on baseline rates of hypercalciuria prior to or following cardiac surgery&#xD;
           with usual care vitamin D intake is not available. The proposed sample size would be&#xD;
           sufficient to demonstrate a 35% difference in proportions if the baseline pre or&#xD;
           post-operative rates were between 0 and 20%.&#xD;
&#xD;
           7 - STATISTICAL ANALYSIS The analyses for both studies will be performed using&#xD;
           Statistical Analysis System (SAS) software (Copyright SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North&#xD;
           Carolina, USA) and a p-value less than 0.05 will be considered statistically&#xD;
           significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Descriptive statistics - Treatment groups will be described and compared using: (i)&#xD;
           means with standard deviations or medians with inter-quartile range values for&#xD;
           continuous variables or (ii) frequencies with percentages for categorical variables.&#xD;
           Statistically significant differences will be determined using Chi-square and Fisher's&#xD;
           exact tests for categorical variables, and t-tests or nonparametric tests (e.g.&#xD;
           Wilcoxon) for continuous variables, as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primary outcome - The primary analytical approach will be to evaluate all randomized&#xD;
           patients in an intention to treat analysis. Differences in the primary outcome measure,&#xD;
           proportion with 25OHD &lt; 50 nmol/L, between the treatment groups will be evaluated using&#xD;
           the Fisher's exact test. Logistic regression analysis will be used if important&#xD;
           variables are unevenly distributed between groups. *We anticipate minimal missing data&#xD;
           as over 95% of participants from the recently completed observational study had an&#xD;
           immediate post-operative sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary outcomes - Secondary analyses will be evaluated between groups based on data&#xD;
           type. Outcome measures that are continuous will be evaluated using the t-test, Wilcoxon&#xD;
           sign rank test (where appropriate) or through linear regression analysis if important&#xD;
           variables are not evenly distributed between groups. Binary secondary outcome measures&#xD;
           (e.g. hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria) will be compared between the two treatment groups&#xD;
           using Fisher's exact or Chi-square. For the analysis of outcomes measures that represent&#xD;
           time to event (e.g. restoration of active hormone (1,25OH2D) levels to normal range,&#xD;
           time to extubation, PICU length of stay) we will apply the log rank test. If&#xD;
           randomization does not lead to equal distribution of important variables (e.g. weight)&#xD;
           the analysis will be expanded to multiple regression modeling.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subgroup analysis - The well known pharmacology of enteral vitamin D dosing shows that&#xD;
           at least 2 months of regular daily intake is required to build body stores and achieve&#xD;
           steady state blood levels of vitamin D. Consequentially neonates or other infants&#xD;
           enrolled into the study who require surgery within two months of birth or CHD diagnosis&#xD;
           will be analyzed separately. Primary objective - Similar to the outpatient study the&#xD;
           primary objective in this subgroup is to report the proportions (in the usual care and&#xD;
           high dose groups) that are vitamin D deficient post-operatively. However, given that&#xD;
           these participants will receive study drug for a very short period we anticipate that&#xD;
           the proportion with 25OHD levels above 50 nmol/L will remain low in the high dose group.&#xD;
           Our program goal at this stage is to identify a dosing regimen that prevent&#xD;
           post-operative vitamin D deficiency in 75% of CHD patients. Given this goal, and an&#xD;
           estimated prevalence of 15 to 35% we would need 12 neonates per group to generate a&#xD;
           confidence interval that excludes 75%. As neonates represent 20% of all CHD surgeries,&#xD;
           we anticipate that enrolling 62 total subjects will be sufficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Feasibility - Most neonates with CHD who require cardiac surgery within the first few&#xD;
           weeks of life have serious cardiac lesions that can limit enteral nutrition and&#xD;
           medication delivery. Anticipating that most of these patients will not significantly&#xD;
           elevate 25OHD levels with daily enteral intake at IOM high dose this study will provide&#xD;
           important information on the willingness of health care providers to provide enteral&#xD;
           study drug. This information will allow us to consider alternative dosing regimen for&#xD;
           future studies based on single or divided representing one or more months worth of daily&#xD;
           dosing (e.g. 5-10,000 IU/kg).&#xD;
&#xD;
           8 - STUDY TEAM AND MANAGEMENT The principal investigator (DM) and co-investigator (KM)&#xD;
           will be responsible for supervision of the study. The research nurse and assistant(s)&#xD;
           will be responsible for participant recruitment and day-to-day management. The Clinical&#xD;
           Research Unit at the CHEO Research Institute which will provide administrative and data&#xD;
           management support. Co-investigator, Dean Fergusson will assist with methodology,&#xD;
           analysis, and interpretation&#xD;

          <description>This group will receive cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) based on the age-specific tolerable daily upper intake level (UL). Specific dose amounts are 1600 IU per day for infants (0-1 year), and 2400 IU per day for children between 1-17 years. Infants under 12 months of age who are formula fed will be given a dose of 1200 IU per day to account for vitamin D in formula.&#xD;
Cholecalciferol: The High Dose group is based on the age-specific UL. These doses were chosen to elevate 25OHD well above 50 nmol/L, while minimizing the risk of vitamin D toxicity (e.g. hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria)</description>

          <description>This group will receive daily cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) based on the Adequate Intake (AI) for infants and the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for children over 1 year. Specific dose amounts are 400 IU per day for infants (0-1 year), and 600 IU per day for children between 1-17 years. Infants under 12 months of age who are formula fed will be given a placebo solution.</description>

          <title>High Dose Group</title>
          <description>This group will receive cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) based on the age-specific tolerable daily upper intake level (UL). Specific dose amounts are 1600 IU per day for infants (0-1 year), and 2400 IU per day for children between 1-17 years. Infants under 12 months of age who are formula fed will be given a dose of 1200 IU per day to account for vitamin D in formula.&#xD;
Cholecalciferol: The High Dose group is based on the age-specific UL. These doses were chosen to elevate 25OHD well above 50 nmol/L, while minimizing the risk of vitamin D toxicity (e.g. hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria)</description>

          <title>RACHS Score</title>
          <description>The Risk Adjustment in Congenital Heart Surgery (RACHS) allows a detailed understanding of differences in mortality among pediatric patients who are undergoing surgery for congenital heart disease (CHD). Patients are assigned to to one of 6 risk categories (Risk Category 1 to Risk Category 6) based on the type of cardiac procedures. The risk categories group cardiac procedures with similar risks for in-hospital death together. A higher risk category means a higher risk of in-hospital death.</description>

            <description>This group will receive daily cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) based on the Adequate Intake (AI) for infants and the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for children over 1 year.

Cholecalciferol: The High Dose group is based on the age-specific UL. These doses were chosen to elevate 25OHD well above 50 nmol/L, while minimizing the risk of vitamin D toxicity (e.g. hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria)</description>
