      The purpose of the investigators study is to examine and compare primary patency between&#xD;
      balloon expandable cobalt chromium stent and self expandable nitinol stents (SCUBA versus&#xD;
      COMPLETE-SE) in atherosclerotic iliac artery lesion.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive atherosclerotic disease of the distal aorta and iliac arteries is preferentially&#xD;
      treated with endovascular techniques, and an endovascular-first strategy can be recommended&#xD;
      for all TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) A-C lesions. Low morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      as well as a &gt;90% technical success rate justify the endovascular-first approach. Currently,&#xD;
      In an attempt to improve outcomes, stent use has increased, and a number of studies favor&#xD;
      iliac stenting over simple Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty (PTA). A meta-analysis&#xD;
      comparing iliac stenting to Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty (PTA) found that stenting&#xD;
      had higher rates of technical success and was associated with a 39% reduction in the risk of&#xD;
      long-term loss of patency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, randomized control trial for comparison of primary patency between balloon&#xD;
      expandable stent and self expandable stent has not been done, although there were some trials&#xD;
      in that primary patency was compared among balloon expandable stents or among self expandable&#xD;
      stents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, The choice of balloon versus self expandable stents is determined mainly by&#xD;
      operator preference. The main advantages of balloon expandable stents are the higher radial&#xD;
      stiffness and the more accurate placement, which is especially important in bifurcation&#xD;
      lesions. In the external iliac artery, a primary stenting strategy using self-expandable&#xD;
      stents compared with provisional stenting is preferred mainly due to a lower risk of&#xD;
      dissection and elastic recoil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the purpose of our study is to examine and compare primary patency between balloon&#xD;
      expandable stent and self expandable stent(SCUBA versus COMPLETE SE stent)&#xD;
