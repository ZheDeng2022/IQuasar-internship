  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Angiogenesis and fibrosis lie at the heart of a number of fundamental processes responsible&#xD;
      for cardiovascular disease. In this proposal, the investigators intend to build upon a highly&#xD;
      successful programme of studies exploring the cardiovascular applications of positron&#xD;
      emission tomography. Specifically, the investigators will explore the potential role of a&#xD;
      novel radiotracer, 18F-fluciclatide, which is a highly selective ligand for the αvβ3 and αvβ5&#xD;
      integrin receptors that are up regulated during angiogenesis, and tissue fibrosis and&#xD;
      remodelling. This tracer has been successfully used to assess angiogenesis in metastatic&#xD;
      tumours and its uptake is suppressed by anti-angiogenic therapies. The investigators here&#xD;
      propose to describe the pattern of uptake of 18F-fluciclatide in cardiovascular diseases,&#xD;
      specifically aortic stenosis and aortic atherosclerosis. The investigators will correlate&#xD;
      18F-fluciclatide uptake with in vivo measures of angiogenesis and fibrosis as well as ex vivo&#xD;
      histological characterisation of tissue. If successful, this novel radiotracer could provide&#xD;
      an extremely important non-invasive method of assessing in vivo angiogenesis, plaque&#xD;
      vulnerability, and tissue remodelling as well as potential applications in developing stem&#xD;
      cell therapies.&#xD;

      Integrins&#xD;
&#xD;
      Integrins are a group of molecules responsible for intercellular adhesion and signalling.&#xD;
      They comprise a superfamily of heterodimeric receptors that are composed of 18 different α&#xD;
      and β subunits. In combination, they can generate 24 different receptor subtypes with a range&#xD;
      of physiological and pathophysiological functions. The αvβ3 receptor is an integrin that is&#xD;
      found at low levels on mature endothelial cells but is markedly up regulated on endothelial&#xD;
      cells of actively growing blood vessels. It was previously known as the vitronectin receptor&#xD;
      although it was subsequently found to bind many other ligands including fibrinogen,&#xD;
      fibronectin, laminin, thrombospondin, von Willebrand factor, and certain collagen subtypes.&#xD;
      These features are also seen with the αvβ5 integrin receptor, with both receptors recognising&#xD;
      the arginine-glycine-aspartate (RGD) motif present on these ligands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1.2 Role of αvβ3 and αvβ5 Integrins in Cardiovascular Disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expression of αvβ3 and αvβ5 receptors is up regulated in a number of diseased states and&#xD;
      this has been particularly well characterised in the angiogenesis associated with tumour&#xD;
      growth and metastases. However, there are many potential roles for this integrin pathway in&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease including myocardial infarction, atherosclerosis, restenosis, aortic&#xD;
      stenosis and aneurysm disease that have been relatively unexplored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1.2.1 Aortic Stenosis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aortic stenosis is characterized by extensive valvular thickening due to accumulation of&#xD;
      fibrous tissue and remodeling of the extracellular matrix. In all three layers of the valve,&#xD;
      abundant fibroblast-like cells are found and are commonly referred to as valvular&#xD;
      interstitial cells. A sub-population of these cells become activated by the inflammatory&#xD;
      activity within the valve and differentiate into myofibroblasts. Whilst fibroblasts control&#xD;
      the synthesis of collagen in the normal valve, myofibroblasts are responsible for the&#xD;
      accelerated fibrosis observed within stenotic valves. In addition, matrix metalloproteinases&#xD;
      are secreted by myofibroblasts and inflammatory cells, and have an important and complex role&#xD;
      in the restructuring of the valve leaflet matrix. As already indicated, activation and&#xD;
      differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts are dependent on αvβ3 and αvβ5 receptor&#xD;
      expression. In addition, mirroring the situation in carotid atherosclerosis, patients with&#xD;
      severe aortic stenosis have a high incidence (78%) of intraleaflet haemorrhage and this is&#xD;
      associated with angiogenesis and more rapid disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histopathological studies have confirmed fibrosis to be an integral part of the left&#xD;
      ventricular hypertrophic process in aortic stenosis. Myofibroblasts infiltrate the myocardium&#xD;
      and secrete extracellular matrix proteins including collagen types I and III. Areas of&#xD;
      fibrosis are observed to co-localize with areas of myocyte apoptosis and it has been&#xD;
      suggested that fibrosis occurs as a form of scarring after myocyte death and injury. As with&#xD;
      fibrosis in the valve, the renin-angiotensin system, transforming growth factor-beta and an&#xD;
      imbalance in matrix metalloproteinase and their tissue inhibitor activity have all been&#xD;
      implicated in this process. A mid-wall pattern of fibrosis has been observed in the&#xD;
      myocardium of up to 38% of patients with moderate or severe aortic stenosis and has been&#xD;
      associated with a more advanced hypertrophic response. Importantly, there is also an 8-fold&#xD;
      increase in mortality associated with mid-wall fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1.2.2 Atherosclerosis and Restenosis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of atherosclerosis is due to a complex interplay of oxidised lipid,&#xD;
      inflammatory cell infiltration, and smooth muscle cell migration in the arterial wall. Once&#xD;
      established, atherosclerotic plaques may progress and rupture leading to the clinical&#xD;
      presentations of acute myocardial infarction and stroke. Features associated with plaque&#xD;
      rupture include a thin fibrous cap, lipid-rich pool and intraplaque haemorrhage. Indeed,&#xD;
      plaque rupture is particularly associated with plaque neovascularisation and&#xD;
      vascular-endothelial growth factor expression suggesting that instability may be induced by&#xD;
      angiogenesis. Thus, up regulation of αvβ3 and αvβ5 receptors may represent a novel marker of,&#xD;
      and potential therapeutic target for, plaque vulnerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1.3 Fluciclatide&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluciclatide is a RGD-containing cyclic peptide that has recently been developed as an&#xD;
      18F-radiotracer to detect tumour angiogenesis by positron emission tomography. It is highly&#xD;
      selective for the αvβ3 and αvβ5 receptors with affinities (EC50) of 11.1 and 0.1 nM&#xD;
      respectively with minimal cross reactivity with the αIIbβ3 receptor (EC50 281 nM).&#xD;
      Pre-clinical tumour work has demonstrated that 18F-fluciclatide is taken up by glioblastomas&#xD;
      and that this is suppressed by the anti-angiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitor, sunitinib,&#xD;
      confirming the specificity of fluciclatide for areas of angiogenesis. It has been assessed in&#xD;
      phase I clinical trials and found to be safe and well tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1.4 Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there have been many preclinical studies examining the application of radiotracers&#xD;
      targeting the αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrin receptors. The clinical application of these tracers has&#xD;
      been largely limited to oncology as a method of assessing angiogenesis within tumours. Here&#xD;
      we wish to explore the role of the αvβ3 and αvβ5 receptor radiotracer, 18F-fluciclatide, to&#xD;
      assess angiogenesis and fibrosis in patients with aortic stenosis as a measure of both&#xD;
      valvular and myocardial fibrosis. This patient group will have co-existent aortic atheroma&#xD;
      and this will provide us with an opportunistic assessment of tracer uptake in&#xD;
      atherosclerosis. We feel it is important to assess a range of cardiovascular conditions to&#xD;
      determine whether αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrin receptor expression is particular to certain disease&#xD;
      processes. If successful, these preliminary data will permit the more detailed exploration of&#xD;
      specific disease areas and novel therapeutic interventions. At present, fluciclatide is not&#xD;
      licensed or approved for clinical use and is being used here as an Investigational Agent to&#xD;
      explore the pathophysiology of aortic stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 ORIGINAL HYPOTHESES&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesise that 18F-fluciclatide can identify the expression of the αvβ3 and αvβ5&#xD;
      integrin receptors in vivo in man in two major cardiovascular disease areas: aortic&#xD;
      atherosclerosis and aortic stenosis. Specifically, we hypothesise that 18F-fluciclatide will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Be taken up into aortic atherosclerotic plaque.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Show demonstrable uptake in the aortic valve and myocardium of patients with aortic&#xD;
           stenosis that will correlate with the degree of active angiogenesis and fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.1 ANGIOGENESIS AND FIBROSIS IN AORTIC STENOSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aortic stenosis is associated with substantial left ventricular hypertrophy and consequent&#xD;
      myocardial fibrosis with the latter predicting prognosis. Left ventricular hypertrophy and&#xD;
      associated fibrosis is also a major risk factor for adverse cardiovascular events in a number&#xD;
      of other conditions including essential hypertension. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is&#xD;
      the gold-standard method of assessing for the presence of myocardial fibrosis but it does not&#xD;
      necessarily indicate the on going activity of the fibrotic process. In this study, we will&#xD;
      assess the uptake of 18F-fluciclatide in patients with aortic stenosis as a model of pressure&#xD;
      overload left ventricular hypertrophy. We will also seize the opportunity to determine&#xD;
      whether there is any uptake of 18F-fluciclatide in the aortic valve given that this has been&#xD;
      shown to have areas of fibrosis and angiogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study patients and healthy volunteers will undergo blood sampling, echocardiogram,&#xD;
      positron emission and computed tomography scans with 18F-fluciclatide as well as cardiac&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging with assessment of gadolinium late enhancement. Following&#xD;
      injection of 18F-fluciclatide, patients will be monitored using our standard clinical&#xD;
      approach, including observation of haemodynamic parameters, and this will continue throughout&#xD;
      their study visit until departure. In patients undergoing aortic valve replacement surgery,&#xD;
      aortic valve tissue will be retained and a 3-mm tru-cut biopsy of left ventricular myocardium&#xD;
      obtained with which to compare the findings from the scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteer patients will not undergo repeat assessment. After a period of one to two&#xD;
      years from their initial scan, patients with Aortic Stenosis will return for repeat blood&#xD;
      sampling, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging with assessment of late gadolinium enhancement&#xD;
      and echocardiogram. Those patients who have undergone an aortic valve replacement will&#xD;
      undergo repeat positron emission and computed tomography scans with 18F-fluciclatide six&#xD;
      months after their operation, prior to their second cardiac MRI scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be assessed using standard clinical biochemical and haematological&#xD;
      profiles such as full blood count and urea and electrolytes. In addition, markers of cardiac&#xD;
      ischaemia, fibrosis and angiogenesis will be assessed. Additional serum, plasma and DNA will&#xD;
      be stored at -80 degrees Celsius for future potential analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.1.2 Study Interpretation&#xD;
&#xD;
      We anticipate that myocardial uptake of 18F-fluciclatide will be increased in patients with&#xD;
      aortic stenosis and left ventricular hypertrophy. We expect the degree of myocardial uptake&#xD;
      to correlate with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging assessment of fibrosis as well as the&#xD;
      histological measures of fibrosis and αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrin receptor expression. We expect&#xD;
      the degree of myocardial uptake to predict cardiac magnetic resonance imaging assessment of&#xD;
      fibrosis following a period of one to two years. In exploratory analyses, we will also take&#xD;
      the opportunity to assess the extent of 18F-fluciclatide uptake within the aortic valve&#xD;
      itself, and if successful, correlate this with histological measures of angiogenesis and&#xD;
      fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.2 ANGIOGENESIS IN AORTIC ATHEROSCLEROSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with aortic stenosis will have a high prevalence of concomitant aortic&#xD;
      atherosclerosis. In Dr Dweck's Fellowship, we were able to exploit this association and&#xD;
      undertake secondary analyses of 18F-sodium fluoride uptake in aortic and coronary&#xD;
      atherosclerosis. This generated some highly innovative findings that informed our&#xD;
      understanding of atherosclerosis and the role of calcification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.2.1 Study Schedule&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use the datasets obtained from the patients above to explore the uptake of&#xD;
      18F-fluciclatide within the thoracic aorta. Atherosclerosis will be identified using computed&#xD;
      tomography and magnetic resonance images obtained of the thorax at the time of the study&#xD;
      scans. No additional image acquisition will be required. This will provide pilot data to&#xD;
      inform subsequent dedicated studies focused on acutely inflamed atherosclerotic plaques, such&#xD;
      as patients with recent transient ischaemic attacks or strokes attributable to carotid&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
