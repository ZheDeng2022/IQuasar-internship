    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of quinacrine dihydrochloride when&#xD;
      given together with erlotinib hydrochloride and to see how well it works in treating patients&#xD;
      with stage IIIB-IV non-small cell lung cancer. Erlotinib hydrochloride may stop the growth of&#xD;
      tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy, such as quinacrine dihydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth&#xD;
      of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving&#xD;
      erlotinib hydrochloride together with quinacrine dihydrochloride may kill more tumor cells&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of the combination of erlotinib (erlotinib&#xD;
      hydrochloride) and quinacrine (quinacrine dihydrochloride) in patients with advanced&#xD;
      non-small-cell lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the recommended Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of the combination of erlotinib&#xD;
      and quinacrine in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe the dose limiting toxicity of the erlotinib and quinacrine combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of the erlotinib and quinacrine combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine objective response rate (complete response [CR]+partial response [PR]) and&#xD;
      clinical benefit rate (CR+PR+ stable disease [SD]) of the erlotinib and quinacrine&#xD;
      combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To estimate overall survival (OS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose escalation study of quinacrine dihydrochloride&#xD;
&#xD;
      Escalation Portion: Patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride orally (PO)daily on days 1-28&#xD;
      and quinacrine dihydrochloride PO thrice daily (TID) on days, 1-7 and PO daily from days&#xD;
      8-28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After Maximum Tolerated Dose is established: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment&#xD;
      arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride PO daily on days 1-28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride PO and quinacrine dihydrochloride PO daily&#xD;
      (TID) on days, 1-7 and PO daily from days 8-28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both arms, courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.&#xD;
