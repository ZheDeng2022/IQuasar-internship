      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Radiation is a common treatment for prostate cancer. It helps damage tumor cells and causes&#xD;
      them to die. Radiation can be effective, but some tumors may be harder to treat with&#xD;
      radiation or even with surgery. This happens to a small number of men who have either&#xD;
      radiation or surgery for prostate cancer. Most men who have these hard-to-treat tumors do not&#xD;
      know if the tumor has recurred only in the prostate or has spread to another area. Also, men&#xD;
      whose prostate cancer has recurred only after radiation may have different treatment options.&#xD;
      This study will use improved imaging studies to better understand why some men do not respond&#xD;
      as well to initial radiation treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To use detailed imaging studies to look at the results of local radiation therapy for&#xD;
      prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Men at least 18 years of age who are scheduled to have radiation for prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Men at least 18 years of age whose prostate cancer has returned after earlier&#xD;
           treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will have a medical history and physical exam. Blood and urine samples&#xD;
           will be collected. Imaging studies will be used to evaluate the cancer at the start of&#xD;
           the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will have an initial full magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the&#xD;
           prostate. Tumor and healthy tissue samples will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Those whose cancer has recurred after treatment will discuss possible treatment options&#xD;
           with the study doctors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants who are scheduled to have radiation will have radiation therapy. This will&#xD;
           be given according to the current standard of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After radiation, participants will have regular follow-up tests and imaging studies.&#xD;
           They will have another full MRI scan 6 months after the end of radiation treatment.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation therapy is a commonly used therapy for prostate cancers. The majority of men with&#xD;
      prostate cancer will be cured by therapy; however a subset, typically men with bulky or&#xD;
      higher risk disease will develop PSA failure after definitive radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, men with a rising PSA after radiotherapy may receive hormonal therapy or may&#xD;
      undergo further evaluation for local failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is not known how many men with rising PSA after radiotherapy may have a local failure and&#xD;
      would benefit from a salvage local therapy. With the availability of a growing number of&#xD;
      local salvage options, accurately defining the presence and characteristics of local failure&#xD;
      is critical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the rate of local recurrence in patients with prostate cancer treated with&#xD;
      radiotherapy using multiparametric prostate MR guided and standard biopsies&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with no local therapy for prostate cancer:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age greater than or equal to 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intermediate or high risk prostate cancer (clinical stage greater than or equal to T2b,&#xD;
      Gleason score 7 or higher, or PSA greater than10, extracapsular extension or seminal vesicle&#xD;
      invasion on MRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will be treated with radiotherapy for prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECOG performance status less than or equal to 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with biochemical relapse after radiotherapy for prostate cancer:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence of prostate cancer recurrence (palpable abnormality after radiotherapy, radiographic&#xD;
      evidence of local failure, biochemical relapse)&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECOG performance status less than or equal to 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age greater than or equal to 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with untreated prostate cancer:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a physical examination, medical history, laboratory tests&#xD;
      (CBC, chemistries, liver transaminases, PSA, PT/PTT), and imaging studies (as appropriate to&#xD;
      staging).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo multiparametric MR imaging and MR guided prostate biopsy of all&#xD;
      suspicious lesions (diagnostic and research)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive radiotherapy at NIH or at an outside facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will return for follow up at 3 month intervals for the first 2 years and then every&#xD;
      six months for 5 years for PSA measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo a multiparametric MR at 6 months after therapy. No biopsy is obtained&#xD;
      unless patients meet the definition of treatment failure. This study would allow future&#xD;
      correlation with early changes that may predict for eventual outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a rising PSA that meet the criteria for biochemical failure by the Phoenix&#xD;
      definition will undergo repeat multiparametric prostate MRI with biopsy of suspicious lesions&#xD;
      (diagnostic and research).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with recurrent prostate cancer:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a physical examination, medical history, laboratory tests&#xD;
      (CBC, chemistries, Liver transaminases, PSA, PT/PTT), and imaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo multiparametric MR imaging and MR guided prostate biopsy of all&#xD;
      suspicious lesions (diagnostic and research)&#xD;
&#xD;
      120 patients with untreated prostate cancer and 70 patients with biochemical recurrence after&#xD;
      radiotherapy will be accrued to this study.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA: men with untreated prostate cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed prostate cancer. The&#xD;
                  outside pathology report is acceptable for study entry. Every effort will be made&#xD;
                  to acquire the outside pathology slides to be confirmed by the Laboratory of&#xD;
                  Pathology, NCI&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Intermediate or high risk prostate cancer (clinical tumor stage T2b or higher,&#xD;
                  Gleason 7 or higher, or PSA greater than 10). Previously obtained MR imaging may&#xD;
                  be used for clinical T staging (extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle&#xD;
                  invasion).&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. No prior local therapy (prostatectomy, radiation, cryotherapy) or hormonal&#xD;
                  therapy for prostate cancer.&#xD;

                  to 60%).&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Radiotherapy is planned as definitive therapy for prostate cancer. For patients&#xD;
                  not treated at NCI ROB patients must have a radiation oncologist who is willing&#xD;
                  to collaborate with the ROB and provide documentation of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed&#xD;
                  consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION CRITERIA: for men with presumed prostate cancer relapse&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must have a history of histologically or cytologically confirmed prostate&#xD;
             cancer. The outside pathology report is acceptable for study entry. Every effort will&#xD;
             be made to acquire the outside pathology slides to be confirmed by the Laboratory of&#xD;
             Pathology, NCI&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age greater than or equal to 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. ECOG performance status less than or equal to 2 (Karnofsky greater than or equal to&#xD;
             60%).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Radiotherapy (external beam irradiation alone or in combination with hormonal therapy&#xD;
             and/or brachytherapy) was delivered as definitive therapy for prostate cancer and&#xD;
             documentation is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Evidence of prostate cancer recurrence (biochemical relapse by the Phoenix definition,&#xD;
             enlarging palpable prostatic abnormality, imaging evidence strongly suggestive of&#xD;
             local failure)&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed&#xD;
             consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients unable to tolerate MRI (patients with pacemakers, cerebral aneurysm clips,&#xD;
             shrapnel injuries, or other implantable electronic devices or metal not compatible&#xD;
             with MRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Evidence of metastases (pelvic lymph node involvement is not an exclusion criteria).&#xD;
             For patients with recurrent prostate cancer, oligometastatic disease (3 or lessfewer&#xD;
             visible metastases) is not an exclusion criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with coagulopathies who are at increased risk for bleeding or on active&#xD;
             anticoagulation therapy (platelets less than 100,000 per mm^3 or PT/PTT greater than&#xD;
             1.5 times the upper normal limit (UNL). Patients are eligible if the underlying cause&#xD;
             is correctable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects weight exceeding MRI or radiation treatment table tolerance&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with active urinary tract infections&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients with renal insufficiency with a GFR less than 30, due to the fact that they&#xD;
             will not be able to undergo gadolinium enhanced MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Uncontrolled illness or comorbidity that in the judgment of the PI would preclude&#xD;
             participation in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C active infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. HIV-positive patients are ineligible because HIV is known to increase radiation&#xD;
             toxicity and may result in under-dosing or alterations in the treatment plan that&#xD;
             would alter the likelihood of local recurrence. Appropriate studies will be undertaken&#xD;
             in HIV positive patients when indicated.&#xD;
