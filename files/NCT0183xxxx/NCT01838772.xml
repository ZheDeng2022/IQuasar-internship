  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness and tolerability of hepatitis C&#xD;
      virus (HCV) treatment in HIV co-infected patients in routine health care services in Asia&#xD;
      through a pilot model of care for treatment of HCV in resource-limited settings.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that 130-170 million people are chronically infected with the hepatitis C&#xD;
      virus (HCV). Out of the 33 million HIV-infected people around the world, it is estimated that&#xD;
      at least 5 million are also infected with HCV. HCV therapy with Pegylated-interferon and&#xD;
      ribavirin is between 50-90% effective to achieve cure, depending on the virus genotype and&#xD;
      patient characteristics, such as ethnicity and IL28B polymorphism. Treatment studies in&#xD;
      HIV-uninfected populations have shown that Asian patients experience higher treatment&#xD;
      response rates than Caucasians. Unfortunately, although HCV therapy is routinely offered in&#xD;
      resource-rich settings, it is essentially inaccessible in resource-limited settings (RLS),&#xD;
      where most of the people infected with the virus live. One of the bottlenecks to increasing&#xD;
      implementation of HCV therapy in RLS is that therapy is currently expensive and deemed&#xD;
      complex for broad implementation in RLS. Through this project and study, TREAT Asia aims to&#xD;
      build a regional approach in Asia to establish the feasibility of HCV therapy in HIV-infected&#xD;
      patients in RLS, and implement an innovative model of HCV-HIV care that can be expanded in&#xD;
      the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with HIV infection and documented HCV antibodies under routine HIV care at the four&#xD;
      study sites will have HCV RNA testing. Patients with confirmed chronic HCV infection will&#xD;
      have HCV genotype and IL28B testing, as well as liver disease assessment with Fibroscan®.&#xD;
      Patients with chronic HCV co-infection with any genotype and meeting all other treatment&#xD;
      eligibility criteria will be offered treatment with pegylated-interferon and ribavirin&#xD;
      through an open-label single arm study. A total of up to 200 patients will be enrolled into&#xD;
      the study. Patients will receive intensive treatment preparedness counseling, and ongoing&#xD;
      treatment adherence support. Most patients will receive treatment for a total of 48 weeks,&#xD;
      but patients with HCV genotype 2 and 3, moderate liver fibrosis, and rapid virological&#xD;
      response (negative HCV RNA by four weeks of therapy) will receive 24 weeks of therapy. The&#xD;
      primary endpoint of interest will be the proportion of patients achieving sustained&#xD;
      virological response, defined as an undetectable HCV RNA 24 weeks after treatment completion.&#xD;
