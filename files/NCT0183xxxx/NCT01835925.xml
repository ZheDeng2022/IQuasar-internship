  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to study which genes are abnormal in rectal cancer and see if&#xD;
      this predicts how well chemotherapy and radiation will reduce the size of cancer and whether&#xD;
      cancer recurs after surgery.&#xD;

      Specific gene mutations have become targets for specific therapies. For example lung&#xD;
      adenocarcinomas with an EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) mutation can be targeted with&#xD;
      an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor achieve striking and durable responses and improved&#xD;
      survival. Another example is the identification of the echinoderm microtubule-associated&#xD;
      protein-like 4/anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene fusions which have led to significant&#xD;
      therapeutic gains in the small percentage of patients with lung adenocarcinoma whose cancers&#xD;
      exhibit this mutation. Specific mutations have been found in colon cancer and specific drugs&#xD;
      targeting these gene alterations are in development. As future therapeutic protocols specific&#xD;
      for these mutations are developed, patients who agree may be notified of their eligibility&#xD;
      for these studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study are to link mutational analyses with clinical outcome. It is&#xD;
      recommended that patients receive 8 cycles of mFOLFOX6 (modified FOLFOX) and 50.4 Gy&#xD;
      radiation with concurrent fluoropyrimidine.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the rectum with no evidence&#xD;
             of distant metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The tumor must be clinically Stage II (T3-4 N0) or III (T1-4 N1-2).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have no evidence of distant metastases including liver metastases,&#xD;
             peritoneal seeding, or inguinal lymphadenopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who completed or are actively enrolled in the CONTRE study and patients&#xD;
             undergoing treatment for rectal cancer following the TNT (Total Neoadjuvant Treatment)&#xD;
             format (see below) for whom sufficient tissue is available for the required research&#xD;
             analyses may be enrolled in this study retroactively.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For those who have not yet received treatment for rectal adenocarcinoma, these&#xD;
             patients must not have received prior chemotherapy or pelvic radiation for rectal&#xD;
             cancer, or prior pelvic radiation for any other malignancy that would prevent the&#xD;
             patient from receiving the required radiation treatments for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have an active concurrent invasive malignancy other than&#xD;
             non-melanoma skin cancers. Patients with malignancies diagnosed within 5 years prior&#xD;
             to randomization which have been effectively treated and are deemed to be at low risk&#xD;
             for recurrence are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be &gt; 18 years of age, ECOG (performance status) 0-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ANC (absolute neutrophil count) &gt;1,500/µl, platelets &gt;100,000/µl, total bilirubin &lt;2.0&#xD;
             mg/dl or direct bilirubin &lt;1.0 mg/dl, alkaline phosphatase &lt;3xULN, ALT &lt;3xULN,&#xD;
             creatinine &lt;1.5xULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed informed consent; able to comply with study and/or follow- up procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Peripheral neuropathy &lt; grade 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The intention of the treating physicians is to administer Total Neoadjuvant Treatment&#xD;
             as per the suggested treatment guidelines in section 4 and section 5 or as per&#xD;
             standard institutional policies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Rectal cancers other than adenocarcinoma, i.e., sarcoma, lymphoma, carcinoid, squamous&#xD;
             cell carcinoma, cloacogenic carcinoma, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy or lactation at the time of proposed randomization. Eligible patients of&#xD;
             reproductive potential (both sexes) must agree to use adequate contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Synchronous invasive colon cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Nonmalignant systemic disease (cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, etc.) that would&#xD;
             preclude the patient from receiving any chemotherapy treatment option or would prevent&#xD;
             required follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with active inflammatory bowel disease, abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal&#xD;
             perforation, or intra-abdominal abscess within 6 months prior to Day 0 or other&#xD;
             serious medical illness which might limit the ability of the patient to receive&#xD;
             protocol therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known hypersensitivity to 5-fluorouracil or oxaliplatin&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Psychiatric or addictive disorders or other conditions that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, would preclude the patient from meeting the study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Insufficient tumor tissue available for the required genomic analyses and patient&#xD;
             unable or unwilling to undergo repeat examination and biopsies.&#xD;
