      Phase 1 of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Falls are the leading cause of preventable injury, long term disability, premature&#xD;
      institutionalization and mortality in the older adult population. Promising preliminary&#xD;
      research suggests that modifications to the home can potentially reduce the incidence of&#xD;
      falls in the elderly. The purpose of this study is to gather data necessary to design a&#xD;
      definitive trial of a home modification intervention for older adults at risk for fall. The&#xD;
      specific aims are to 1) estimate the efficacy of an intensive tailored environmental&#xD;
      intervention to reduce functional decline among community-dwelling older adults; 2) gather&#xD;
      the data necessary to design a definitive clinical trial of an intensive tailored&#xD;
      environmental intervention to reduce the cumulative incidence of falls among&#xD;
      community-dwelling older adults; 3) examine the direct cost of intensive tailored home&#xD;
      modification. A pilot randomized controlled trial will be conducted with 40 older adults who&#xD;
      have experienced a fall resulting in an emergency room visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our long-term objective is to prevent falls for these older adults at high risk by removing&#xD;
      hazards in their homes. Development of an effective intervention for fall reduction could&#xD;
      have an immediate impact for this population and high public health significance. Intensive&#xD;
      home hazard removal has been established as an effective environmental intervention for the&#xD;
      prevention of falls; however, none of the published studies have been conducted in the US,&#xD;
      and no study has adequately controlled for biases. The investigators propose a&#xD;
      double-blinded, randomized sham-controlled clinical trial to determine the efficacy of an&#xD;
      intensive tailored home hazard removal intervention to reduce the cumulative incidence of&#xD;
      falls among 110 community-dwelling older adults who visit the emergency department (ED)&#xD;
      because of a fall. This three year study will be the first to utilize a sham control group&#xD;
      and a double-blind, randomized study design. The investigators will intervene with a&#xD;
      high-risk group of community-dwelling older adults who visit an ED after a fall. The primary&#xD;
      hypothesis will be tested by comparing the 12-month cumulative incidence of falls in an&#xD;
      intensive tailored home intervention group with falls in a sham control group. Falls will be&#xD;
      operationalized as unintentional movements to the floor, ground or object below knee level.&#xD;
      The secondary hypothesis will be tested by comparing total number of falls, number of&#xD;
      injurious falls, fear of falling and performance in daily activities between the intervention&#xD;
      and sham control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the proposed study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Compare the efficacy of an intensive tailored home hazard reduction intervention to sham&#xD;
           treatment on the cumulative incidence of falls over 12 months for older adults who visit&#xD;
           the ED after a fall.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis 1: The cumulative incidence of falls over 12 months will be lower for the&#xD;
           intensive tailored home hazard removal group compared to the sham control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The secondary aims of the proposed study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine if intensive tailored home hazard reduction intervention is superior to sham&#xD;
           treatment on secondary outcomes including: total number of falls, number of injurious&#xD;
           falls, fear of falling and activities of daily living (ADL) performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis 2: The investigators hypothesize that the intensive tailored home hazard&#xD;
           reduction intervention group will experience fewer total falls, fewer injurious falls,&#xD;
           less fear of falling and improved ADL performance compared to the sham control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Characterize intensive tailored home hazard reduction interventions including the&#xD;
           frequency of environmental modification by type and location in the home and its direct&#xD;
           costs. The investigators will also conduct subgroup analysis of type, location and cost&#xD;
           of home modifications by race and gender.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study is innovative because it provides intensive, individualized prescriptions&#xD;
      of home hazard removal and because it provides a quick response to a fall. It is also the&#xD;
      first double-blind trial of the effect of environmental modification on falls and, to our&#xD;
      knowledge, is the first collaboration between occupational therapy and emergency medicine on&#xD;
      fall reduction strategies in the US.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the proposed study will provide new evidence about the effectiveness of&#xD;
      intensive tailored home hazard removal to reduce falls. This study has the potential to&#xD;
      provide public health guidelines for the delivery of home hazard removal, decrease the health&#xD;
      care costs associated with falls and to provide evidence for guiding public health policy for&#xD;
      older adults who have fallen.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One intervention that has proved successful in improving ADL performance is providing&#xD;
      environmental supports such as home modifications. By using environmental support to&#xD;
      compensate for the intrinsic limitations this population experiences, ADL and instrumental&#xD;
      ADL (IADL) performance can be maximized. In studies of fall causes, environmental features&#xD;
      are often identified as an important contributing factor. It is possible that home&#xD;
      modifications could be an effective intervention strategy to reduce functional decline, fear&#xD;
      of falling, and the incidence falls among older adults with ADL/IADL dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The consequences of falls in the elderly are a serious public health concern. Older adults&#xD;
      who visit an ED as a result of a fall and are discharged home represent an underserved group&#xD;
      at great risk for a future fall. The model of screening for older adults at risk for&#xD;
      recurrent falls in the ED and initiating interventions is a potentially cost-effective&#xD;
      strategy with broad public health implications. Intensive home modifications are an appealing&#xD;
      intervention, with high adherence rates and efficacy in improving ADL performance and&#xD;
      reducing the rate of falls. There is a need for studies of home modifications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will conduct a blinded, randomized, sham-controlled pilot trial to estimate the efficacy&#xD;
      of an intensive tailored environmental intervention to reduce functional decline among&#xD;
      community-dwelling older adults who visit the ED because of a fall. We will also gather the&#xD;
      data necessary to design a definitive double-blinded, randomized, sham-controlled clinical&#xD;
      trial to determine the efficacy of an intensive tailored environmental intervention to reduce&#xD;
      the cumulative incidence of falls in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Older adults who visit the ED or contact emergency medical services (EMS)as a result of a&#xD;
      fall at home will be randomly assigned to a sham-control or intervention group. The&#xD;
      intervention will be delivered via a standardized tailored protocol. Blinded assessments will&#xD;
      be conducted of participants' performance before intervention, 6 months after intervention,&#xD;
      and 12 months after intervention. Participants will be blinded to treatment group assignment.&#xD;
      Upon intervention completion, we will monitor ADL status and falls monthly for 12 months to&#xD;
      determine the effect of this intervention over time. Study participants and raters will be&#xD;
      blinded to their randomization assignment. The outcome of the study will be masked as&#xD;
      improvement in ADL status. This study will be conducted in two phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent and enrollment, evaluation, intervention, and follow-up procedures are the same for&#xD;
      both phases of the study. The same measures will be used for both phases of the study.&#xD;
