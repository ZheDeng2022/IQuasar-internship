    <textblock>
      Open-label randomized phase III trial, using a non-inferiority comparison design. After&#xD;
      randomization,patients will receive either post-operative radioiodine ablation with an&#xD;
      activity of 1.1 GBq (30 mCi) after stimulation by rhTSH, and then be followed-up (ablation&#xD;
      group) or be followed-up (without postoperative radioiodine ablation) (follow-up group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is to assess the non-inferiority of the proportion of patients without&#xD;
      tumor-related event evaluated at three years after randomisation in the absence of&#xD;
      radioiodine ablation (follow-up group) compared to the ablation group, in patients with&#xD;
      low-risk differentiated thyroid cancer treated with total thyroidectomy with or without lymph&#xD;
      node dissection (pT1am N0 or Nx, pT1b N0 or Nx)&#xD;
