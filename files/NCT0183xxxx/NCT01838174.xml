  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that the novel melanocortin-mediated anti-inflammatory effects of ACTH will&#xD;
      reduce axonal loss following ON by limiting inflammatory optic nerve injury. We will compare&#xD;
      the effect of ACTH and intravenous methylprednisolone therapy on axonal injury following ON&#xD;
      using OCT, a sensitive, reproducible and noninvasive tool to measure RNFL thickness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be the average RNFL thickness at 6 months. Additional pre-specified&#xD;
      statistical analyses will compare the difference in the mean RNFL thickness at 6 months in&#xD;
      the affected eye between the IV methylprednisolone- and Acthar-treated groups, and the mean&#xD;
      6-month affected eye RNFL thicknesses adjusted for the baseline unaffected eye RNFL. The&#xD;
      secondary outcome measure will examine the frequency of optic nerves with RNFL swelling&#xD;
      between the IV methylprednisolone- and Acthar-treated groups at 1 and 3 months. A predefined&#xD;
      exploratory outcome will compare the ganglion cell plus inner plexiform layer (GC+IPL)&#xD;
      thickness at 6 months between treatment groups. Additional tertiary outcome will be the&#xD;
      assessment of changes in fatigue, mood, visual function depression, and quality of life in&#xD;
      patients with AON. Assessment will be completed by administration of the following&#xD;
      questionnaires: Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life 54&#xD;
      Instrument, 25-item Visual Function Questionnaire with 10-item supplement, Beck's Depression&#xD;
      Inventory. These questionnaires have been validated for the MS (AON) population. Descriptive&#xD;
      and correlative analysis will be done at each visit time point to assess for QOL for this&#xD;
      study population.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with their first episode of unilateral acute ON will be treated with either 3 days&#xD;
      of IV methylprednisolone followed by 11 days of oral prednisone or 15 days of intramuscular&#xD;
      or subcutaneous corticotropin (Acthar).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a parallel active group, randomized controlled trial in which up to 100 people with&#xD;
      clinically unilateral acute optic neuritis (≤ 2 weeks of vision loss; with or without a&#xD;
      previous diagnosis of relapsing remitting MS) will be treated with either ACTH or IV&#xD;
      methylprednisolone/prednisone for 2 weeks to assess RNFL thickness. The primary, secondary,&#xD;
      and tertiary outcomes will be as noted above. Participants will be assessed for&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria by their treating neurologist/ophthalmologist at the University&#xD;
      of Colorado Denver (PI- Dr. Jeffrey Bennett) or The University of Pennsylvania Scheie Eye&#xD;
      Institute (PI- Dr. Kenneth Shindler). Following informed consent, the University of Colorado&#xD;
      will determine patient randomization for both sites per the established randomization scheme.&#xD;
      A secured fax or email confirmation regarding randomization will be sent to the University of&#xD;
      Pennsylvania research staff and proper pharmacy orders will be placed by the site&#xD;
      investigator or designee. We expect to enroll up to 50 subjects per institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following informed consent and randomization, participants will undergo baseline procedures&#xD;
      (visit 1) and receive treatment with either high dose methylprednisolone (1000 mg IV qD for 3&#xD;
      days followed by 60 mg oral prednisone daily for 11 days) or Acthar (80 U IM or SC daily for&#xD;
      5 days followed by 40 U IM or SC daily for 10 days). Study follow-up visits will subsequently&#xD;
      occur at 1, 3, and 6 months. During each visit, including baseline (visit 1), ETDRS, low&#xD;
      contrast acuity (2.5%), and color vision (Farnsworth D-15) will be assessed. OCT evaluations&#xD;
      (Optic Disc Cube 200x200 and Macular Cube 512x128) will be performed at baseline, 1, 3 and 6&#xD;
      months using spectral domain OCT (Cirrus OCT; Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA, USA). Automated&#xD;
      visual fields (Humphrey 30-2 SITA) will be performed at baseline (visit 1) and month 6.&#xD;
      Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life 54 Instrument, 25-item&#xD;
      Visual Function Questionnaire with 10-item supplement, Beck's Depression Inventory&#xD;
      questionnaires will be assessed at each study visit. The patient's treating physician will&#xD;
      perform blood tests and MRI evaluations to exclude other causes of optic neuropathy at the&#xD;
      initial study visit as part of their routine care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RNFL edema will be defined as either average RNFL thickness greater than the 95th percentile&#xD;
      of the age matched normal database or a ratio of RNFL thickness (affected/fellow eye) greater&#xD;
      than 1.1 in any quadrant.8 The study sites will collect and report data on AEs and SAEs per&#xD;
      standard practice.&#xD;
