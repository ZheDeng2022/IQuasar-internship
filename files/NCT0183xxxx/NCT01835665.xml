  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of nimodipine as well as&#xD;
      the safety and tolerability of oral nimodipine in progranulin mutation carriers in&#xD;
      preparation for longer term efficacy studies in patients with frontotemporal dementia due to&#xD;
      progranulin gene mutations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      8 people with a GRN gene mutation will be given escalating doses of oral nimodipine for four&#xD;
      weeks, followed by the maximally tolerated dose for four weeks. To maximize enrollment, the&#xD;
      trial will enroll both symptomatic and asymptomatic GRN mutation carriers. The trial will&#xD;
      include a four week, dose-escalation phase followed by 1-month maintenance phase, and a&#xD;
      1-week taper. Assessments at the study site will take place prior to starting nimodipine,&#xD;
      each week the dose is increased (weeks 1-5), after 4 weeks of maintenance dose, and 2 weeks&#xD;
      after completion of the study. These will include blood chemistry tests, ECGs, and blood&#xD;
      pressure. Both dose escalation and maintenance will focus on safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      nimodipine treatment in this population as well as plasma progranulin levels as a biomarker&#xD;
      outcome. The trial will incorporate a variety of other fluid biomarker (blood and CSF) and&#xD;
      imaging assessments to determine which will be most sensitive to nimodipine pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      effects in this population.&#xD;

    <description>Plasma progranulin levels will be obtained at screening, baseline, and at each week dose is increased, after the 4 week maintenance phase, and 2 weeks after the taper. Due to the small sample size, inferential statistics will not be calculated to assess the endpoints of interest. However, descriptive statistics will be presented for the primary and secondary outcome measures (such as plasma and CSF progranulin levels) summarized by treatment group and visit. For these continuous variables, the following information will be presented by visit: n, mean, standard deviation and order statistics (minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile and maximum). These statistics will be presented using the actual value at baseline and the change from baseline for later data.</description>
