    <textblock>
      This study is being done to determine whether or not addition of the oral medication,&#xD;
      pioglitazone to standard chemotherapy, results in improvement of blood tests that measure the&#xD;
      body's ability to utilize sugar (glucose and insulin metabolism). In addition the&#xD;
      investigators want to determine whether or not treatment with pioglitazone results in (1)&#xD;
      improvement in the size of the tumor, (2) weight gain, (3) improved ability to function&#xD;
      during the day and (4) quality of life.&#xD;

    <description>The FACT-Hep Scale (version 4) measures quality of life, It consists of five subscales: (1) physical well-being (PWB); (2) social and family well-being (SFWB); (3) emotional well-being (EWB); (4) functional well-being (FWB); and the hepatobiliary cancer subscale (HepCS). Possible scores range from 0 to 180, with lower scores indicating a better quality of life</description>
