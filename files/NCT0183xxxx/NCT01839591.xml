  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In severe bronchial asthma the mechanism of inflammation and bronchospasm is complex and&#xD;
      still not clarified. The smooth muscle cells play an important role from the mechanical point&#xD;
      of view, as a culmination of neurogenic stimuli and inflammatory cytokines that determine as&#xD;
      final effect the bronchospasm and over time a hypertrophy of the muscular coat. There are&#xD;
      some other hypothesis that the smooth muscle cells may play a role as central regulator of&#xD;
      chemical mediators that cause bronchospasm and inflammation, although there are currently no&#xD;
      firm conclusions 2 According to other studies3,the nerve receptors TRANSIENT RECEPTOR&#xD;
      POTENTIAL VANILLOID TYPE 1 have a great importance in the complex mechanism of airway&#xD;
      inflammation too. (There are at least 4)&#xD;
&#xD;
      These receptors would intervene according to the following mechanism:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Irritants on the bronchial mucosa stimulate the TRANSIENT RECEPTOR POTENTIAL VANILLOID&#xD;
           TYPE 1 present on afferent endings of sensory fibers, unmyelinated C (chemiosensitive&#xD;
           neurons)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. On the same afferent axon acting factors with the activation effect (lowering the&#xD;
           activation threshold, increase the expression, promote the translocation of TRPV1&#xD;
           receptor on the membrane). Among these factors the neurotrophins of which the most&#xD;
           important NERVE GROWTH FACTOR (NGF)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The activation of TRPV1 (through release of Ca2 + +) determines two efferent responses:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. CENTRALLY-MEDIATED&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. LOCAL AXON Reflex&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators hypothesized that BT may have a strong influence on the destruction of nerve&#xD;
      receptors TRPV1 and unmyelinated nerve fibers located in the mucosa going to stop reflections&#xD;
      both central and local authorities responsible for the activation of bronchospasm. In support&#xD;
      of this hypothesis, there are some anatomical studies4, which show that these receptors are&#xD;
      more numerous at the level of main bronchi which are the main target of BT. Please note in&#xD;
      this context that it is already known that in thermoablations commonly used in cardiology it&#xD;
      is used a radio frequency with development of heat controlled to 65 °, as in the BT, able to&#xD;
      interrupt the circuit nervous responsible for the activation of the circuit causing the&#xD;
      abnormal 'arrhythmia.&#xD;

      The mechanism of action the bronchial thermoplasty exerts the positive action demonstrated by&#xD;
      the studies through is not yet well understood yet. The only action on the denaturation and&#xD;
      destruction of the smooth muscle layer of the bronchi at intermediate and high caliber&#xD;
      perhaps not fully explain its action, taking into account that most of the smooth muscle&#xD;
      loading of the small airways is minimally altered by the procedure. From the premises&#xD;
      outlined in the section on the mechanism of inflammation we hypothesized that BT may have a&#xD;
      strong influence on the destruction of nerve receptors TRPV1 and unmyelinated nerve fibers&#xD;
      located in the mucosa going to stop reflections both central and local authorities&#xD;
      responsible for the activation of bronchospasm. In support of this hypothesis, there are some&#xD;
      anatomical studies4, which show that these receptors are more numerous at the level of main&#xD;
      bronchi which are the main target of BT. Please note in this context that it is already known&#xD;
      that in thermoablations commonly used in cardiology it is used a radio frequency with&#xD;
      development of heat controlled to 65 °, as in the BT, able to interrupt the circuit nervous&#xD;
      responsible for the activation of the circuit causing the abnormal 'arrhythmia.&#xD;
