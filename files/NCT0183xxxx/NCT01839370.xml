  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, a closed-loop Adaptive Insulin Meal Supervisor system (AIMS) utilizing&#xD;
      continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), a subcutaneous insulin pump and standard pramlintide&#xD;
      therapy will be applied in individuals with type 1 diabetes. Pramlintide, a drug well&#xD;
      recognized to help control hyperglycemia with meals, will be evaluated in both closed loop&#xD;
      and open loop control. It is expected that the closed loop control condition with pramlintide&#xD;
      will improve glycemia, thus combining better control with enhanced safety. In a recent pilot&#xD;
      study, the investigators started testing this concept and collected data showing that in&#xD;
      order to be successful such strategy must have a controller equipped with the ability to&#xD;
      optimize the configuration and timing of meal boluses with concomitant administration of&#xD;
      pramlintide. Our preliminary data and review of previously unavailable individual data from a&#xD;
      German study indicate a large individual variability in the timing of the appearance of meal&#xD;
      insulin needs. Thus, for both adequate safety and efficacy of meal insulin on pramlintide,&#xD;
      the investigators have developed a new closed-loop controller that accounts for the&#xD;
      variability in the individual responses to a meal and meal delays, the Adaptive Insulin Meal&#xD;
      Supervisor system (AIMS). In this study, the performance of a combination between the AIMS&#xD;
      system and a standard pramlintide treatment will be tested versus the standard pramlintide&#xD;
      treatment alone.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current study will probe the concept that if a Model Predictive Control insulin delivery&#xD;
      strategy for closed-loop glucose control supervised by a safety system is coupled with a&#xD;
      standard amylin replacement therapy in patients with type 1 diabetes the resulting combined&#xD;
      treatment will unify the benefits of both individual therapies. In order to reduce post-meal&#xD;
      blood glucose excursions in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, pramlintide (an analog of&#xD;
      the human β-cell hormone, amylin) has been utilized, thus dealing with the problem or meal&#xD;
      hyperglycemia more effectively than insulin infusion alone. Pramlintide has been successful&#xD;
      in maintaining more normal blood glucose concentrations by significantly improving the&#xD;
      postprandial glucose excursions in these patients when added to their mealtime insulin to&#xD;
      mimic more closely the diurnal β-cell secretory pattern seen in normal physiology. However,&#xD;
      pramlintide treatment can result in post-prandial hypoglycemia primarily due to overbolusing&#xD;
      with insulin. Closed-loop systems have shown potential for significantly reducing&#xD;
      hypoglycemia. A combined closed-loop insulin + pramlintide therapy could provide advantages&#xD;
      over each of the individual therapies, and may also provide certain benefits with respect to&#xD;
      weight control and improvement in sense of well being while decreasing glucose variability. A&#xD;
      potentially important secondary benefit of combining the pramlintide treatment with a precise&#xD;
      insulin delivery by the closed-loop system is that, based upon animal studies performed by&#xD;
      the research team, a moderate inhibition of glucagon, as is usually achieved with pramlintide&#xD;
      treatment, is anticipated to potentially improve the safety of insulin treatment as well by&#xD;
      enhancing the glucagon response to hypoglycemia, which are usually impaired in type 1&#xD;
      diabetes, if it should occur in the early postprandial period.&#xD;
