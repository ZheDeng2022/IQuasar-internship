      Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) describes a common medical condition in men over 45&#xD;
      associated with voiding (obstructive) and storage (irritative) lower urinary tract symptoms&#xD;
      and is in part related to prostate enlargement and obstruction. The standard medical therapy&#xD;
      for this condition includes 5-alpha reductase inhibitors -5ARI (eg dutasteride) or alpha&#xD;
      blocker therapy (eg tamsulosin), while the most effective medical therapy for BPH is the&#xD;
      combination of these two medications. Approximately 10 to 20% of patients diagnosed with BPH&#xD;
      also have either a diagnosis of or symptoms of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain&#xD;
      syndrome (CP/CPPS) with typical genito-urinary pain and discomfort. This particular subset of&#xD;
      patients of BPH patients with prostatitis symptoms pose a therapeutic dilemma. CP/CPPS (organ&#xD;
      specific phenotype) is the third most prevalent prostate disease after prostate cancer and&#xD;
      BPH. CP/CPPS is very prevalent (3-9% of men) and represents a significant percentage of&#xD;
      urology outpatients (3-8% of male outpatient visits)resulting in a major impact on quality of&#xD;
      life of patients and economic costs to society. Clinical phenotyping allows for prediction of&#xD;
      the patients with CP/CPPS most likely to respond to dutasteride and tamsulosin (age, Lower&#xD;
      Urinary Tract Symptoms [LUTS] and prostate related phenotypes [BPH]). It can be estimated&#xD;
      that up to 30% of men currently diagnosed with CP/CPPS will include men with co-existing&#xD;
      Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) We propose to determine the efficacy of JALYN&#xD;
      (dutasteride-tamsulosin combination) in the amelioration of prostatitis symptoms in men&#xD;
      diagnosed with CP/CPPS who have the following clinical phenotype; age = 45 years, Lower&#xD;
      Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS), enlarged prostate and Organ (prostate) specific symptoms (eg.&#xD;
      BPH and CP/CPPS).&#xD;

      Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) describes a common medical condition in men over 45&#xD;
      associated with voiding (obstructive) and storage (irritative) lower urinary tract symptoms&#xD;
      and is in part related to prostate enlargement and obstruction [1]. The standard medical&#xD;
      therapy for this condition includes 5-alpha reductase inhibitors -5ARI (eg dutasteride) or&#xD;
      alpha blocker therapy (eg tamsulosin), while the most effective medical therapy for BPH is&#xD;
      the combination of these two medications [2]. Approximately 10 to 20% of patients diagnosed&#xD;
      with BPH also have either a diagnosis of or symptoms of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic&#xD;
      pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) with typical genito-urinary pain and discomfort [3,4,5]. This&#xD;
      particular subset of patients of BPH patients with prostatitis symptoms pose a therapeutic&#xD;
      dilemma [6].&#xD;
&#xD;
      CP/CPPS (organ specific phenotype) is the third most prevalent prostate disease after&#xD;
      prostate cancer and BPH. CP/CPPS is very prevalent (3-9% of men) [7,8] and represents a&#xD;
      significant percentage of urology outpatients (3-8% of male outpatient visits) [9,10]&#xD;
      resulting in a major impact on quality of life of patients [11] and economic costs to society&#xD;
      [12].&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no good evidence based therapies for CP/CPPS [13,14], although there is some&#xD;
      evidence available to consider 5 alpha reductase inhibitor and alpha blocker therapies [22].&#xD;
      There is an enormous unmet need to evaluate potential therapies for this condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our current understanding of CP/CPPS patients are that they are a heterogeneous group of&#xD;
      unique patients (the &quot;snow flake&quot; hypothesis) presenting with different clinical phenotypes&#xD;
      [15]. We have proposed [16,17], validated [18] and recently proved that clinical phenotyping&#xD;
      (using our UPOINT classification system) is possible and provides more effective treatment&#xD;
      strategies [19].&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are studies that suggest that the same medical therapy that has proven effective for&#xD;
      the treatment of BPH would also be beneficial for prostatitis like symptoms as well. A number&#xD;
      of small pilot studies with finasteride [20], including a contemporary 6 month RCT [21], have&#xD;
      strongly suggested that 5 ARI therapy may be effective in patients with CP/CPPS, but these&#xD;
      studies were limited by study design including inclusion of all patients with the diagnosis&#xD;
      of CP/CPPS (ages and clinical phenotypes that we now know could not possibly benefit from a&#xD;
      5ARI). REDUCE and many other epidemiology studies, have documented that men over 45 years old&#xD;
      suffer from prostatitis and prostatitis symptoms [23]. REDUCE also clearly shows that&#xD;
      dutasteride favorably impacts on prostatitis-like symptoms and men with prostatitis-like&#xD;
      syndrome enrolled in that study [24]. In fact, the potential benefits suggested by&#xD;
      extrapolating REDUCE results far outweigh any other intervention we have evaluated in any of&#xD;
      the large North American NIH sponsored RCTs in the last decade [25,26,27]. A further&#xD;
      sub-analyses of REDUCE shows that men with IPSS â‰¥ 8 and enlarged prostates (eg BPH) have a&#xD;
      significant symptom benefit with dutasteride, irregardless of prostate size [28].These&#xD;
      initial findings in REDUCE in patients not specifically diagnosed with CP/CPPS should be&#xD;
      expanded to examine the benefits in a CP/CPPS population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are more clinical trials evaluating alpha blockers than any other therapy in CP/CPPS&#xD;
      [22, 29]. While two North American RCTs [25,26] did not show benefit, 6 other alpha blocker&#xD;
      randomized placebo controlled trials using validated contemporary outcomes were positive in&#xD;
      terms of measureable benefits [30-35]. The latest clinical trial confirming the benefits of&#xD;
      alpha blocker therapy in selected CP/CPPS patients (approximately 50 patients per arm in 12&#xD;
      week study) was recently published [35] and showed benefit, primarily in the LUTS symptom&#xD;
      domain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical phenotyping allows for prediction of the patients with CP/CPPS most likely to&#xD;
      respond to dutasteride and tamsulosin (age, Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms [LUTS] and prostate&#xD;
      related phenotypes [BPH]). It can be estimated that up to 30% of men currently diagnosed with&#xD;
      CP/CPPS will include men with co-existing Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH)&#xD;
