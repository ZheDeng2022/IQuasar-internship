      -  The investigators are conducting a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study comparing two&#xD;
           MRI contrast agents in people with clinically isolated syndrome and relapsing remitting&#xD;
           multiple sclerosis (MS). MS is a disease that affects the white matter and gray matter&#xD;
           in the brain. MRI is used as a gold standard to visualize the degenerative changes in&#xD;
           the brain and spine. The neurologist will usually order an MRI to confirm the diagnosis&#xD;
           of MS using conventional imaging methods. These images reveal two main pieces of&#xD;
           information regarding (a) the location of the lesions and (b) the status of the lesions.&#xD;
           While the location of the lesions directly correlates with the clinical symptoms, the&#xD;
           information about the status of the lesions informs the neurologist whether the lesion&#xD;
           is new (active) or old (chronic).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This ability to differentiate new and old lesions requires the use of a contrast agent.&#xD;
           Currently, used agents reveal some lesions but it is unclear if they reveal the full&#xD;
           extent of the disease. In new lesions, there may be a leakiness in the blood vessels and&#xD;
           if the contrast agent leaks out then the investigators can see this. In healthy&#xD;
           controls, the blood brain barrier is usually intact and this leak does not happen. One&#xD;
           open question is: &quot;can the extravasation of the contrast agent to the brain precede the&#xD;
           major tissue damage that we see in the structural MRI?&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recently, a new FDA approved contrast agent (Gadavist) has been released and has&#xD;
           enhanced characteristics in terms of affecting the MR signal resulting in a better&#xD;
           contrast in the image and therefore, better diagnosis of the status of the disease.&#xD;
           Given its high relaxivity, a small amount of Gadavist may show a better signal&#xD;
           enhancement affected tissue for multiple sclerosis patients. The investigators&#xD;
           hypothesize that Gadavist will reveal more tissue damage (lesions) than Magnevist and,&#xD;
           therefore, may present a better tool for early diagnosis of brain damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The investigators' goal in this research project is to see if the newer contrast agent&#xD;
           is able to detect changes and differentiate healthy from affected tissue in the white&#xD;
           matter and gray matter earlier than current contrast agents so that detection can be&#xD;
           possible before major damage occurs to the tissue. Each person will be scanned initially&#xD;
           with one agent and then between 8 and 30 days later with the other agent. The MR data&#xD;
           processing results will be compared to check the efficacy of each contrast agent.&#xD;

      Rationale/Goal: The use of contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been a&#xD;
      gold standard in diagnosing multiple sclerosis (MS). One active lesion (i.e. enhanced after&#xD;
      the injection of contrast agent) is one of the major McDonald criteria in diagnosis patients&#xD;
      with MS and request further follow up. Therefore, it is of great importance to study the&#xD;
      characteristics of contrast agents and their ability to cross the blood brain barrier and&#xD;
      enhance lesions, and thus understand the mechanism underlying this debilitating disease. It&#xD;
      is the aim of this proposal to compare lesion load visualization in MS patients using&#xD;
      Magnevist and Gadavist contrast agents and show reduced whole brain perfusion of MS patients&#xD;
      compared to healthy subjects. This proposal will allow us to investigate the increase in&#xD;
      angiogenic sensitivity to contrast agent (Gadavist), in addition to testing the ability to&#xD;
      differentiate the breakdown of blood brain barrier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Study Design: Fifty-four (54) subjects will be enrolled in this study including 36 MS&#xD;
      patients and 18 healthy subjects as age and gender-matched controls over a one year period.&#xD;
      Approval from Wayne State University Institutional Review Board (IRB) will be obtained before&#xD;
      the beginning of this study. All the participants will sign an informed consent form after&#xD;
      being told about the study and its possible associated risks. We propose to study 18&#xD;
      relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) patients and 18 clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) patients and&#xD;
      18 normal controls. The subjects will be scanned at entry and a second time (scan 2) - no&#xD;
      sooner than 8 days after the first scan but no later than 30 days after the first scan. Every&#xD;
      effort will be made to scan them as close as possible to the 8 day period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nine RRMS and nine CIS patients will undergo an MR scan using Magnevist first (scan 1 at&#xD;
      entry) then Gadavist (scan 2) while the other nine in each category will undergo an MR scan&#xD;
      using Gadavist first (scan 1 at entry) then Magnevist (scan 2). Eighteen normal subjects will&#xD;
      undergo the same protocol described above for MS patients, 9 with one order (Magnevist then&#xD;
      Gadavist) and 9 with the other (Gadavist then Magnevist), to be used as age and gender&#xD;
      matched controls for data analysis. Patients will be recruited by physicians affiliated with&#xD;
      the Detroit Medical Center (DMC) and surrounding areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MR Protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have prepared an MR imaging protocol that will allow this information to be&#xD;
      assessed quantitatively in both the MS and normal populations. This protocol will include the&#xD;
      usual conventional T2, fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), susceptibility weighted&#xD;
      imaging (SWI), pre and post T1 scans (both volumetric interpolated breath-hold (VIBE) and&#xD;
      magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition with gradient echo (MP-RAGE)) at early and later&#xD;
      time points as well as dynamic susceptibility contrast enhanced perfusion weighted imaging&#xD;
      (DSC-PWI), flow and average perfusion using phase contrast (PC), MR angiography (MRA) and&#xD;
      double inversion recovery (DIR). For DSC-PWI, the investigators have developed the perfusion&#xD;
      software necessary to analyze this data quantitatively including a new processing approach&#xD;
      referred to as Tissue Similarity Mapping (TSM). This technique uses all time points in the&#xD;
      PWI data to yield a new means to study similarities between blood flow patterns in tissue of&#xD;
      the brain. It may help in better diagnosing vascular differences between tissues&#xD;
      (specifically MS lesions), in addition to the conventional processing to measure relative&#xD;
      cerebral blood flow, relative cerebral blood volume, mean transit time, and several other&#xD;
      measures in the white matter and gray matter areas of the brain. If Magnevist was used in the&#xD;
      initial scan, this protocol will be repeated on the same subject after a period of 8 to 30&#xD;
      days using Gadavist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Image acquisition The investigators have designed this protocol to assess the&#xD;
           pathophysiology of MS lesions in space and in time. SWI will be used as a means to&#xD;
           visualize iron deposition in lesions, possibly resulting from myelin breakdown or&#xD;
           microhemorrhages. FLAIR, T2 and DIR will be used to assess any inflammation or edema in&#xD;
           lesions. Contrast enhanced sequences including PWI, SWI and T1, in that order, will be&#xD;
           used to dynamically assess the vascular characteristics of the different structures of&#xD;
           the brain including white matter, gray matter and lesions. PC will be used to&#xD;
           investigate the blood supply and drainage to and from the brain and any correlation with&#xD;
           identified perfusion deficit. This will add 4 to 6 minutes to the original protocol.&#xD;
           MRA, on the other hand, will be used to visualize and assess the blood supply system&#xD;
           integrity. Finally, the investigators will acquire T1 and SWI sequences at different&#xD;
           time points post contrast (please refer Sequence_Order.pdf) to compare the mechanism of&#xD;
           work Magnevist and Gadavist have in terms of relaxivity and permeability and their&#xD;
           ability to show more lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data analysis Perfusion Weighted Imaging PWI is a well established MRI method for&#xD;
           studying cerebral hemodynamics and has found various applications in tumor, angiogenesis&#xD;
           and stroke imaging. The hemodynamic characteristics are determined by creating maps of&#xD;
           various parameters, such as: cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV),&#xD;
           mean transit time (MTT) and time to bolus peak (TTP), and these parameter maps are&#xD;
           derived from the evolution of the intensity of T2*-weighted gradient- or spin-echo,&#xD;
           echo-planar images as a gadolinium contrast agent bolus passes through the blood&#xD;
           vessels. Through the use of these maps, it is possible to visualize the passage of blood&#xD;
           throughout the brain and to identify any regions of abnormal behavior. Quantification of&#xD;
           these hemodynamic parameters is possible, utilizing the central volume theorem and a&#xD;
           subsequent deconvolution technique. the investigators developed software SPIN (signal&#xD;
           processing in Nuclear magnetic resonance), Detroit, Michigan, USA) to process the PWI&#xD;
           source data to create perfusion maps. The position of the arterial input function (AIF),&#xD;
           which is needed for deconvolution, is automatically determined by using the maximum&#xD;
           concentration (Cmax), time to peak (TTP) and first moment MTT (fMTT). The&#xD;
           concentration-time curve for arteries has short fMTT, short TTP and high Cmax. Twenty&#xD;
           voxels, which best fit these properties, are selected. Then, the concentration-time&#xD;
           curves of these voxels are averaged, smoothed and truncated to avoid the signal from the&#xD;
           second pass of the tracer. Singular value decomposition (SVD) was used to determine the&#xD;
           hemodynamic parameters such as CBV, CBF and MTT. The parametric maps will be derived&#xD;
           from the PWI data using the investigators' in-house software SPIN. These maps include&#xD;
           relative cerebral blood flow and cerebral blood volume in white matter, gray matter and&#xD;
           MS lesions. This will reveal any changes/ abnormalities related to the vascular system&#xD;
           such as ischemia, infarcts or any abnormal blood flow to any specific region that might&#xD;
           be involved in MS pathogenesis. Finally, color-coded maps of CBV and CBF with the&#xD;
           application of threshold were computed and generated pixel-by-pixel for better&#xD;
           visualizing the differences between tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Susceptibility Weighted Imaging A 64x64 (or equivalent) low spatial frequency kernel&#xD;
           matrix was used to complex-divide the original k-space data to create an effective high&#xD;
           pass filtered phase image (check reference 12). The resulting SWI filtered phase image&#xD;
           is used as a means to visualize lesions and their iron content.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conventional MR sequences including T1, T2 and FLAIR Two blinded radiologists will&#xD;
           review the conventional MR data sets to determine the presence of chronic and active MS&#xD;
           lesions over time and compare the results with non-conventional MR quantitative results&#xD;
           (SWI and PWI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Organization: This study will be performed at Wayne State University, Detroit, MI. MRI&#xD;
      data will be obtained using a 3 Tesla Siemens system (Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen,&#xD;
      Germany) with a state-of-the-art 32 channel head coil and the latest SWI software located at&#xD;
      the basement of Harper University Hospital (affiliated with Wayne State University).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Fifty-four (54)subjects will be recruited in this study including 18 RRMS&#xD;
      patients, 18 CIS patients and 18 control subjects. Patients will be recruited by physicians&#xD;
      affiliated with the Detroit Medical Center (DMC), Oakland Hospital in Detroit, Michigan (MI)&#xD;
      and other local hospitals and physicians. Patients with prior known neurological disorders&#xD;
      other than MS or substances abuse, with contraindication to MRI such as pacemaker, pregnancy,&#xD;
      other non-MR compatible implanted device as well as with moderate to severe kidney disease&#xD;
      that have impaired ability to filter the contrast agents will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
      Brain MRI scans will be obtained once at entry as the investigators will be running a cross&#xD;
      sectional study. Controls will be recruited from the university environment in Detroit and&#xD;
      the surrounding areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assignment of subjects to study arms or groups - Randomization: The contrast agent used&#xD;
           will be randomly assigned to MS patients and controls while ensuring the coverage of&#xD;
           each type of agent for the two groups to be studied. The conventional dose (according to&#xD;
           the FDA guidelines) of 0.2 mL/kg (0.1mmol/kg) for Magnevist and 0.1 mL/kg (0.1mmol/kg)&#xD;
           for Gadavist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blinding: Data processors as well as radiologists, will be blinded to what contrast&#xD;
           agent has been used to ensure objectivity in data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary Efficacy Variable(s): Post contrast imaging sequences will be repeated after 5&#xD;
           and 20 minutes to monitor lesions visualization as a function of time and test the&#xD;
           efficacy of both contrast agents as diagnostic measures, revealed by crossing the blood&#xD;
           brain barrier into MS lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary Efficacy Variable(s): SWI data will be collected after 10 minutes and 25&#xD;
           minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety Variables: Safety Monitoring All subjects will initially be screened for&#xD;
           inclusion and exclusion criteria by physician (MS patients) or key personnel involved in&#xD;
           this research (normal volunteers). After the consent/ Health Insurance Portability and&#xD;
           Accountability Act (HIPAA) is signed, a further MRI and MRI contrast safety assessment&#xD;
           will be conducted by the Research Nurse and/or the MRI Research Technologist involved in&#xD;
           this research. Only when all safety parameters are met, will the subject be scanned. The&#xD;
           research technologist will communicate with the subject as well as visually observe them&#xD;
           during the entire exam for their comfort and safety. Once the scan is complete, the&#xD;
           subject will be assessed one more time by the Research Nurse and/or the MRI Research&#xD;
           Technologist. In case of an unexpected problem during the MRI scan or MRI contrast&#xD;
           administration, the radiologist will be notified immediately to assess the situation.&#xD;
           The PI as well as the subjects physician (if known) will also be notified about the&#xD;
           event. The PI will be responsible to submit any or all source documents and report forms&#xD;
           to the IRB in less than 5 working days. In each case, the PI will also provide a&#xD;
           judgment in consultation with a radiologist as to whether or not the adverse event is&#xD;
           associated with or related to the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sample Size Assumptions / Target Number of Valid Cases: Power analysis: With 18 RR&#xD;
           patients for both Magnevist and Gadavist, the power to differentiate between a p(n)=0.2&#xD;
           versus a p(MS) = 0.5 is above 80%. Here p refers to the probability that PWI flow&#xD;
           abnormalities exist in the normal versus MS population, respectively.&#xD;
