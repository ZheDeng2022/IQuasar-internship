  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this research study the investigators want to learn more about the risk of developing&#xD;
      blood vessel and heart disease from night-time sleep apnea. Sleep apnea is a condition that&#xD;
      results from blocking of the throat during sleep. This study examines changes in blood&#xD;
      pressure, blood vessel stiffness, heart size and levels of specific substances in the blood&#xD;
      which may cause heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is for children ages 5 to 13 years. The study involves 3 visits over 18 months.&#xD;
      The first and last visits include an overnight sleep study (polysomnography or PSG). All the&#xD;
      visits will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  body measurements to measure growth and how weight is distributed,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  resting blood pressure measurements,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  heart measurements (electrocardiogram and ultrasounds of the heart and blood vessels),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  36 hour home ambulatory blood pressure measurements,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  blood tests to look at things like fats, cholesterol, inflammatory factors,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optional parts of the study include DNA and for children 8 years and older, testing and&#xD;
      questionnaires to learn more about how sleep relates to learning, memory and behavior issues.&#xD;

      This study is designed primarily to investigate the changes in blood vessels compliance and&#xD;
      stiffness in children ages 5 to 13 years with the syndrome of obstructive breathing during&#xD;
      sleep. It is designed to examine the relationship of the severity of the syndrome to vascular&#xD;
      functions and to specific inflammatory mediators related to early stages of arterial&#xD;
      stiffness and their effect on cardiovascular end-points, namely twenty-hour ambulatory blood&#xD;
      pressure and left ventricular mass. The study will also examine the relationship between&#xD;
      plasma and tonsillar tissue levels of inflammatory cytokines, and as well as the&#xD;
      relationships between obstructive breathing during sleep and children's attention and&#xD;
      problem-solving skills. Our aim is to identify vascular risk factors in childhood and to&#xD;
      determine whether sleep disordered breathing in children represents an independent risk&#xD;
      factor for cardiovascular disease and neurodevelopmental deficits which if left inadequately&#xD;
      identified could track into adult years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis that increased levels of inflammatory cytokines will correlate with severity&#xD;
           of the OSA disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis that severity of the OSA disorder will correlate with measures of increased&#xD;
           arterial wall stiffness, which in turn will lead to an increase in pulse pressure and&#xD;
           left ventricular mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will examine the vascular function in children, both lean and obese, with the&#xD;
      syndrome of obstructive breathing during sleep which encompasses children with varying&#xD;
      degrees of sleep disordered breathing (SDB). Children included in the SDB groups will have&#xD;
      OSA above 1 obstructive episode per hour of sleep. The standard of care for a child with&#xD;
      symptoms of obstructive breathing during sleep in otolaryngology practices is to undergo a&#xD;
      tonsillectomy and or adenoidectomy (T&amp;A). Children with SDB and who are scheduled to have T&amp;A&#xD;
      will be followed for 18 months and compared to children without SDB. To discern the effect of&#xD;
      obesity on vascular function from the effects of sleep disordered breathing (SDB), the study&#xD;
      will consist of four groups. Two groups, one lean and one obese, will have SDB and two&#xD;
      groups, one lean and one obese, will be normal controls. Efforts will be made to match&#xD;
      subjects across all groups. There is the potential that all groups will not contain the same&#xD;
      number due to differences in incidence of OSA in relation to weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 3 visits over approximately 18 months. The first visit will function as a&#xD;
      qualifying visit based on the Obstructive Index from the polysomnography (OI&gt;1 for SDB group&#xD;
      and OI&lt;1 with no snoring for the control group). Visits are approximately 9 months apart with&#xD;
      the first and last visit including overnight polysomnography (PSG). Tonsillar tissue&#xD;
      specimens will be obtained from a subset of SDB subjects who are scheduled for T&amp;A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data captured will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood will be measured for high-sensitivity C reactive protein (hsCRP), serum amyloid A,&#xD;
           cytokine panel, fasting lipoprotein analysis, complete blood count (CBC), glucose,&#xD;
           insulin direct renin and DNA (optional).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tonsillar tissue will be measured for hsCRP, serum amyloid A, cytokine panel.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anthropometrics including height, weight, arm and finger circumferences, neck&#xD;
           circumference, waist to hip ratio, and arm lengths.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Left ventricular structure and vascular stiffness measurements include echocardiogram,&#xD;
           carotid ultrasound, and radial tonometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Resting blood pressure measurements include a continuous beat to beat BP recording&#xD;
           obtained by a Portapres monitor with ECG and respiration monitoring done throughout&#xD;
           sleep during the PSG and 30 minutes while awake in the morning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Activity and home ambulatory blood pressure (AMBP)measurements will be continuously&#xD;
           monitored (every 30 minutes) using an automated oscillometric BP monitor over a 36 hour&#xD;
           period simultaneously with actigraphy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires about sleep and QOL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A subset of subjects aged 8 and older can participate in a neurobehavioral component&#xD;
           that includes a formal assessment of attention and problem-solving.&#xD;
