  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if BL-8040 in combination with&#xD;
      cytarabine (Ara-C) can help to control the disease in patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia&#xD;
      (AML) that has relapsed or did not respond adequately to previous treatment. The safety of&#xD;
      the study drug combination will also be studied.&#xD;

      Open-label, multicenter, phase IIa, dose escalating study in subjects with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory AML, defined according to WHO criteria (1), including subjects who failed&#xD;
      chemotherapy only and those who failed previous Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation (ASCT) /&#xD;
      Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation (AlloSCT), provided at least 6 months have passed from&#xD;
      transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will receive subcutaneous (SC) injections of BL-8040 (&quot;monotherapy period&quot;)&#xD;
      over two days (one injection per day) followed by concurrent administration of BL-8040 with&#xD;
      standard salvage chemotherapy (&quot;combined period&quot;) over 5 days. During the &quot;combined period,&quot;&#xD;
      BL-8040 will be administered 4 hours prior to chemotherapy. The chemotherapy will consist of&#xD;
      cytarabine (Ara-C) 1.5 or 3 g/m2/d per dose (based on age), administered intravenously (IV)&#xD;
      over 3 hours, for 5 days and will not be escalated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first part of the study (Part 1) will include escalating dose groups and be considered&#xD;
      the 'escalation phase'. Six potential dose levels (see Table 1) will be investigated starting&#xD;
      at dose level 1. Patients will be accrued in a conventional 3+3 design. Applying this study&#xD;
      design, the first cohort of 3 patients will be treated at dose level 1 and evaluated for dose&#xD;
      escalation.&#xD;
