  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare CORTEX (Cognitive Regulation Training and Exercise),&#xD;
      a multi-faceted, general and exercise-specific cognitive training program plus a 4-month&#xD;
      exercise program, to an attention-control condition involving health and wellness&#xD;
      informational lectures plus videos. The proposed exercise program will involve both aerobic&#xD;
      and resistive exercises. The investigators hypothesize that pre-intervention cognitive&#xD;
      training will enhance self-regulation and self-efficacy and in turn, increase exercise&#xD;
      adherence. The investigators also expect more positive improvements in cognitive and&#xD;
      psychosocial function among participants in the CORTEX condition as compared to the Control&#xD;
      condition immediately following the cognitive booster training, and across time.&#xD;

      Primary Aim 1: To determine the efficacy of pre-intervention cognitive training for improving&#xD;
      exercise adherence and engagement. We hypothesize that class participation rates, physical&#xD;
      activity counts, and self-reported exercise participation levels will be higher at 4 months&#xD;
      for participants in the CORTEX condition relative to the Control condition. We also predict&#xD;
      that pre-intervention training will demonstrate high feasibility/acceptability, as indicated&#xD;
      by a thorough process evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim 2: To determine if integrated general and exercise-specific cognitive training&#xD;
      improves facets of executive function and exercise-related efficacy judgments. We hypothesize&#xD;
      that participants in the CORTEX condition will show faster reaction times and greater&#xD;
      accuracy for trained and untrained-domain-relevant tasks, including dual task performance,&#xD;
      reasoning, and thought-stopping at post-booster testing and 4-month follow-up. Furthermore,&#xD;
      we hypothesize that CORTEX participants will show significantly higher levels of exercise&#xD;
      efficacy judgments, and exhibit greater automaticity (faster reaction times) in making those&#xD;
      judgments, at post-booster testing, 1 month and 4-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim 1: We will use longitudinal mediation analyses to examine mechanisms of change&#xD;
      brought about by the cognitive training effects on exercise adherence and engagement. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that changes in efficacy and use of self-regulatory strategies will mediate&#xD;
      cognitive training effects on exercise adherence over 4-months.&#xD;
