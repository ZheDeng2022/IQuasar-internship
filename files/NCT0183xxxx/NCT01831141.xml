    <textblock>
      Congenital solitary kidney (CSK) is a disorder caused by an abnormal development of one of&#xD;
      the two kidneys. The reported incidence ranges between 1:450-3200. It is debated whether CSK&#xD;
      is a benign condition or not. A variable risk of developing proteinuria (11-27%),&#xD;
      hypertension (0-60%) and chronic kidney damage (3.5-30%) is described. This knowledge derives&#xD;
      mainly from retrospective studies performed in tertiary medical centers which is difficult to&#xD;
      compare for the following reasons: the number of individuals evaluated, the length of&#xD;
      follow-up and the outcome studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this longitudinal study is to assess, in a cohort of children with congenital&#xD;
      solitary kidney, during a 10 year follow-up period: 1) the rates of developing proteinuria,&#xD;
      hypertension and chronic kidney disease and the corresponding potential prognostic factors.&#xD;
      2) the role of new biomarkers of glomerular (Cystatin C) or tubular damage (NGAL, NAG,&#xD;
      B2-microglobulin) in predicting the appearance of chronic kidney damage.&#xD;

      Congenital Solitary kidney (CSK) is a disorder caused by the abnormal development of one of&#xD;
      the two kidneys. This abnormality can be either anatomical, caused by unilateral renal&#xD;
      agenesis (RAG), or functional, caused by extreme forms of dysplasia (renal aplasia-RAP and&#xD;
      multicystic dysplastic kidney disease-MCKD). The reported incidence is between 1:450-3200&#xD;
      with no difference between the two sexes. CSK is a subgroup of a large family of Congenital&#xD;
      Anomalies of the Kidney and Urinary Tract (CAKUT), which are caused by abnormal embryologic&#xD;
      development. Physiologically, the development of the kidney begins during the 3rd week of&#xD;
      gestation and proceeds through a series of phases: the pronephros, mesonephros, and&#xD;
      metanephros. While abnormalities of the early pronephros-mesonephros phases lead to renal&#xD;
      agenesis, an aberrant metanephros phase can cause a more wide spectrum of CAKUT. CAKUT are&#xD;
      the leading cause of chronic (50%) and end stage (40%) kidney disease in children. While this&#xD;
      risk is well known for some phenotypes (e.g. bilateral renal hypodysplasia and posterior&#xD;
      urethral valves), whether CSK is a benign condition or not, has been the subject of recent&#xD;
      debate. The knowledge of the natural history of CSK originates mainly from retrospective&#xD;
      studies often performed in tertiary medical centers which are difficult to compare for&#xD;
      several reasons: the number of individuals studied varied considerably as did the underlying&#xD;
      CSK disorders (RAG, MCKD or RAP), the length of follow-up and the type of outcomes&#xD;
      considered. These studies show an extremely variable risk of developing proteinuria (11-27%),&#xD;
      hypertension (0-60%), and chronic kidneys disease (3.5-30%). So there are many difficulties&#xD;
      which prevent us from understanding: a) which phenotype (RAG, MCKD or RAP) or risk factors&#xD;
      could influence the progression to an adverse outcome; b) whether or not the compensatory&#xD;
      hypertrophy and resulting hyperfiltration acts as a protective mechanism. Recently,&#xD;
      Sanna-Cherchi et al. retrospectively analyzed the long-term renal outcome of over 300&#xD;
      children with CAKUTs. With simple selection criteria, dialysis-free survival from birth was&#xD;
      modelled to account for concomitant vesicoureteral reflux, age at diagnosis, hypertension,&#xD;
      proteinuria, and serum creatinine concentration. Surprisingly the analysis revealed that&#xD;
      patients with solitary kidney have a probability of nearly 50 % of requiring dialysis by 30&#xD;
      years of age. This clinical outcome raises the possibility that subclinical defects could be&#xD;
      present in the congenital solitary kidney which may account for a poorer prognosis. This&#xD;
      hypothesis is also supported by the fact that the long-term prognosis in individuals with&#xD;
      acquired single kidney (e.g. transplant donors or subject nephrectomized for Wilm's tumor)&#xD;
      appears to be excellent. This reported high risk of poor outcome in CSK patients has&#xD;
      highlighted the need for understanding: 1) the rate and the factors determining progression&#xD;
      to end-stage renal disease; 2) the development of biomarkers to improve early detection.&#xD;
      Usually, children with CSK are not always subjected to long term follow-up and when they are,&#xD;
      monitoring involves plasma creatinine concentration , proteinuria and ultrasonography.&#xD;
      Because most cases of endstage renal disease in children result from tubulointerstitial&#xD;
      rather than glomerular disorders, serum creatinine and urine protein determinations are&#xD;
      relatively insensitive. New biomarkers are now available that can facilitate the early&#xD;
      identification of changes in renal function before they become irreversible. These biomarkers&#xD;
      of glomerular (serum Cystatin C) or tubular damage (urine alfa-1 and beta-2 microglobulin,&#xD;
      urine lysozyme, serum and urine neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL), urine&#xD;
      Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE3), urine Kidney injury molecule 1 (KIM1), urine&#xD;
      N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG), already validated for various kidney diseases (acute&#xD;
      renal failure, nephrotic syndrome, etc), could be useful in the early identification of&#xD;
      damage in CSK patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this longitudinal study is to assess, in a cohort of children with CSK, during a&#xD;
      10-year follow-up period:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the rates of developing proteinuria, hypertension and chronic kidney disease and&#xD;
           potential prognostic factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the role of new biomarkers of glomerular or tubular damage in predicting the appearance&#xD;
           of chronic kidney damage.&#xD;
&#xD;

      diabetes, heart and/or vascular diseases and autoimmune diseases will be excluded. Subjects&#xD;
