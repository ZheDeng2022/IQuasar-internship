    <textblock>
      This research study includes children ages 5 to 20 years old with Collagen Type 6 Congenital&#xD;
      Muscular Dystrophy or Laminin α2-related muscular dystrophy (LAMA2-MD). The goal of this&#xD;
      study is to measure the effect of breathing exercise to stretch the chest in slowing the loss&#xD;
      of breathing function. The breathing stretches are done with a machine called Cough Assist®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is being done at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and Children's&#xD;
      Hospital of Philadelphia. The study involves traveling to one of these 2 centers for 4 visits&#xD;
      over 13 months. The study also includes 3 sets of phone visits called Daily Phone Diaries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be &quot;randomized&quot; into one of 2 study groups in a 1:1 ratio. The treatment&#xD;
      group will use the Cough Assist® machine twice a day for 15 minutes. The control group will&#xD;
      continue with their current daily care. The Cough Assist® is a machine that blows air into&#xD;
      the lungs (insufflation) and helps pull air out of the lungs. The investigators will be&#xD;
      blowing enough air into the lungs to cause a stretch to the chest. This is called&#xD;
      hyperinsufflation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visits will last about 5 to 6 hours and will include medical and quality of life&#xD;
      questionnaires and pulmonary function tests to determine lung function and the individualized&#xD;
      settings to be prescribed for the Cough Assist®.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) secondary to collagen VI deficiency and Laminin&#xD;
      α2-related muscular dystrophy (LAMA2-MD) are distinct genetic neuromuscular disorders&#xD;
      presenting from birth. Respiratory failure is the principal cause of morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      from the disease. As CMD has no existing treatment, the majority of affected children develop&#xD;
      respiratory failure and require non-invasive ventilation between the first and second decades&#xD;
      of life. There is evidence that in muscular dystrophy the progressive decrease in lung volume&#xD;
      is disproportionally greater than anticipated for the degree of respiratory muscle weakness.&#xD;
      Chest wall stiffness and decreased lung elasticity which collectively diminish compliance of&#xD;
      the respiratory system are believed to be important contributors to the disproportionate&#xD;
      decrease in lung volume. The investigators' research aims at testing the hypothesis that in&#xD;
      subjects with CMD Collagen VI and LAMA2-MD, daily passive stretch of the chest wall through&#xD;
      lung hyperinsufflation therapy could slow down the annual rate of decline in lung volume,&#xD;
      delay the onset of respiratory failure and improve quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, controlled, interventional study. The intervention consists of an&#xD;
      individualized hyperinsufflation titration protocol. The duration of the active protocol will&#xD;
      last 12 months. Because CMD presents a limited subject pool, this study is a partnership with&#xD;
      Cincinnati Children's Hospital of Cincinnati (CCHMC) and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia&#xD;
      (CHOP) with approximately half of the studies being done at each site. Potential subjects&#xD;
      will be identified through Cure CMD international registry and disease specific websites to&#xD;
      meet the needed number of subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 1, subjects will have their baseline assessments, QOL (quality of Life)&#xD;
      questionnaires, and pressure titration and hyperinsufflation protocol to determine Peak&#xD;
      Insufflation Pressure (PIP). Subjects will be given their randomization assignment into&#xD;
      either the Treatment or Control arm. Both groups will have pressure titration and&#xD;
      hyperinsufflation protocols for Peak Insufflation Pressure (PIP) at each study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the Treatment Group, participants at Visit 1 will leave with prescription settings on the&#xD;
      Cough Assist® device and they will begin the 12 month interventional period with 15 minute,&#xD;
      twice daily hyperinsufflation treatments. Between visits, the Treatment group will mail back&#xD;
      the information card (SD card) from the Cough Assist to measure adherence. All visits will be&#xD;
      identical for both treatment and control group and will include all the activities from Visit&#xD;
      1 except for randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be 3 scheduled phone visits for the Daily Phone Diary (DPD) encounters. The DPD is&#xD;
      a phone-based diary that tracks patients and / or caregivers through their activities over&#xD;
      the past 24 hours using a cued recall procedure. A set of two DPDs (one weekday and one&#xD;
      weekend day) is conducted by phone at each of the 3 assessment points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators anticipate a significant number of subjects will live greater than 100&#xD;
      miles from the research centers. Travel arrangements will be made by family and paid for by&#xD;
      the study through additional funding provided by Cure CMD.&#xD;
