  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators wish to document the distribution of EGFR somatic mutations, and assess the&#xD;
      relationship between specific genotype, clinical demographic, therapy, and survival, in a&#xD;
      large cohort of EGFR mutant NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators also wish to comprehensively investigate the relationship between germline&#xD;
      DNA and risk of EGFR mutant NSCLC developing, through a GWAS (Genome-Wide Association&#xD;
      Studies) and candidate gene approach, and explore the relationship between germline DNA and&#xD;
      clinical outcome, in order to potentially identify germline genetic modifiers of EGFR TKI&#xD;
      (Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor) outcome.&#xD;

      Objective 1: To identify germline allelic DNA variation associated with somatic EGFR mutation&#xD;
      in NSCLC, Objective 2: Correlation between germline allelic variants and survival in EGFR&#xD;
      somatic mutant NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 3: Study germline allelic DNA variation associated with never /ex light smoking&#xD;
      NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 4: Catalogue distribution of somatic EGFR mutant genotypes in 1,000 EGFR mutant&#xD;
      NSCLC cases and describe their relationship to clinical outcome.&#xD;

    <description>Patients with proven EGFR mutation in exons 18-21 from tumor material. Patients with unknown or failed tumor EGFR genotyping will be ineligible. Patients subsequently undergoing re-genotyping which demonstrates an EGFR mutation will become eligible for the &quot;case&quot; cohort.&#xD;
No known somatic KRAS, HER2, LKB1, BRAF, or PI3K, mutation or ALK gene rearrangement (or ALK3+ immunohistochemistry). If these mutations are known to be present the patient will be ineligible. However, patients will not be tested specifically for these mutations for this study and patients with unknown status are acceptable. If patients are subsequently tested after enrollment and found to harbor any of these mutations they will be considered ineligible and will be replaced.&#xD;
No known Li Fraumeni, Li Fraumeni-like, or Peutz Jeghers syndrome family, or known germline carriers of mutant LKB1 or TP53. Patients will not have to be tested specifically for these syndromes to be eligible for this study.</description>

    <description>Patients known to be somatic EGFR &quot;wild-type,&quot; i.e. no mutation detected in exons 18-21 from tumor material.&#xD;
Patients with unknown or failed EGFR genotyping will be ineligible. Patients subsequently undergoing re-genotyping which demonstrates an EGFR wild-type will become eligible for the &quot;control&quot; cohort.&#xD;

             the disease course.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any type (surgery, RadioTherapy, chemotherapy, targeted agents) of previous treatment&#xD;

        Absence of any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition potentially&#xD;
        hampering compliance with the study protocol; those conditions should be discussed with the&#xD;
