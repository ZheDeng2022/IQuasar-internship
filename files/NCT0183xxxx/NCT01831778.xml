      The Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) database contains data from 1994-2009 on&#xD;
      breast cancer screening, quality, and outcomes, and its main goal is to advance breast cancer&#xD;
      research. This project is funded to maintain the BCSC database and share the data with&#xD;
      investigators. Our objectives are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maintain the BCSC pooled database using secure methods that protect the confidentiality&#xD;
           of women, radiologists, facilities, and BCSC registries;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Encourage and facilitate sharing of BCSC research resources, and continue developing and&#xD;
           implementing our communications plan to expand resource dissemination;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide statistical and scientific expertise to researchers, distribute customized&#xD;
           limited datasets, and analyze BCSC data;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Develop and support a new web-based dynamic query tool and other electronic interfaces&#xD;
           to efficiently share aggregated BCSC data with the public.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The BCSC is a collaboration of breast imaging registries formally established in 1994 with&#xD;
      support from the National Cancer Institute (NCI). As the BCSC SCC, we coordinate standardized&#xD;
      data collection, pool data from the registries, develop statistical methodology, conduct&#xD;
      statistical analyses for research projects, and share data with within and beyond the&#xD;
      consortium. The current BCSC database consists of data collected by five active mammography&#xD;
      registries and two inactive registries:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Carolina Mammography Registry in North Carolina (CMR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group Health Registry in Seattle, Washington (GHC)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  New Hampshire Mammography Network (NHMN)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  San Francisco Mammography Registry (SFMR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vermont Breast Cancer Surveillance System (VBCSS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  New Mexico Mammography Project in Albuquerque (NMMP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Colorado Mammography Advocacy Project (CMAP)&#xD;
&#xD;
      These registries have been actively collecting data since 1994 or 1996 (depending on&#xD;
      registry) including patient risk factors, clinical history, breast-imaging procedures&#xD;
      (screening and diagnostic), benign and malignant pathology results, cancer outcomes, vital&#xD;
      status, radiologist characteristics, and facility information. Some registries have data&#xD;
      going back to the 1970s; however, this information is mostly used to determine prior breast&#xD;
      cancer diagnoses and mammography exposure. Most analysis limit data to 1994 forward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Registry procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      BCSC data will be shared using 4 main approaches:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Completed deidentified datasets and summary statistics made publicly available on the&#xD;
           internet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A web-based data query tool for automatically creating user-specified completely&#xD;
           deidentified data sets and summary statistics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Customized data sets created by the Statistical Coordinating Center (SCC) and delivered&#xD;
           to investigators using secure methods, after BCSC steering committee approval of a&#xD;
           research proposal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Statistical analyses performed by the SCC, after BCSC steering committee approval of a&#xD;
           research proposal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality factors:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data used by the BCSC have been previously collected directly from each BCSC registry.&#xD;
      The BCSC database has no personal identifiers such as names, phone numbers, addresses, or&#xD;
      social security numbers and no one in the population will be contacted for additional data&#xD;
      collection. The data set only contains HIPAA limited identifiers: dates, ages &gt;89, and ZIP&#xD;
      codes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is possible that new data will be collected under this contract as determined by the BCSC&#xD;
      Steering Committee. This could include corrections to the current data, updates to existing&#xD;
      data elements (e.g., additional radiology data, updated cancer and vital status outcomes), or&#xD;
      new data elements (i.e., information about advanced imaging modalities, cancer biomarkers).&#xD;
      New data will not contain personal identifiers. Individual-level data will never be shared&#xD;
      unless rigorously examined and approved by the Steering Committee (which will include the&#xD;
      principal investigators from each BCSC site) and the appropriate IRB safeguards are in place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our major objective for this contract is to maintain the current high standards of the BCSC&#xD;
      database with no interruption in service to the scientific community. We will continue to be&#xD;
      a resource to the research community, providing scientific and statistical expertise and&#xD;
      conducting high-quality statistical analyses to advance breast cancer research. We will&#xD;
      expand outreach and dissemination, so that more investigators are aware of this valuable&#xD;
      resource and use it for their research. Our second objective is to develop new electronic&#xD;
      interfaces and publicly available datasets that meet the highest possible standards for&#xD;
      caBIGÂ® compatibility. This will facilitate efficient sharing of BCSC data and expand&#xD;
      potential for collaboration, increasing its value to the broader research community. Our&#xD;
      ultimate aim is to facilitate research that improves breast cancer screening and reduces&#xD;
      cancer burden and mortality.&#xD;

        The BCSC pooled database includes data from seven BCSC registries, of which five are&#xD;
        currently active. Information comes from a large study population that is ethnically,&#xD;
        geographically, and socioeconomically diverse. The database currently includes 9 million&#xD;
        mammograms from 2.3 million women interpreted by over 1400 radiologists at 400 facilities.&#xD;
        There are 1.1 million digital mammograms; 660,000 ultrasounds; 180,000 benign and malignant&#xD;
        biopsies; and records of over 155,000 deaths. Over 107,000 women have a breast cancer&#xD;
        diagnosis, of which 83% are first diagnosed in 1994 or later. The data are collected in the&#xD;
        course of routine, clinical care to accurately represent community practice.&#xD;
