  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis is the most common of the arthritides, affecting at least 20 million&#xD;
      Americans, a number that is expected to double over the next two decades. currently available&#xD;
      medical therapies primarily address the treatment of joint pain in patients with&#xD;
      osteoarthritis.Analgesics as well as traditional and cyclooxygenase-2-selective nonsteriodal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have suboptimal effectiveness,and there is some question&#xD;
      about their safety, especially in the light of recent reports of increased cardiovascular&#xD;
      risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plai (Zingiber cassumunar Roxb.) belongs to family of Ginger. Plai essential cream also has&#xD;
      an activity on scavenging H2O2 generated by ultrasound exposure. The dilutions of 1:2,000 and&#xD;
      1:1,000 (v:v) of plai cream presented H2O2 scavenging activity by reducing emissions of&#xD;
      DCFH-fluorescence within U937 cells, compared with the cell control. Plai essential cream&#xD;
      inhibited nitric oxide (NO) production in the macrophage cell line (J774), compared with&#xD;
      untreated cells. However, high concentrations of plai cream (1:1 and 1:10), were toxic to&#xD;
      U937 and J744 cell lines. Moreover, plai cream at dilutions of 1:1,000 and 1:2,000,&#xD;
      significantly inhibited COX II activity in treated cells compared to the untreated cells.&#xD;
      Three major compounds of plai essential cream were sabinene, terpinen-4-ol and&#xD;
      (E)-1-(3,4-dimethyoxyphenyl) butadiene respectively.There have been many studies on the&#xD;
      efficacy of Plai as an analgesic and anti-inflammatory when applied directly to the affected&#xD;
      area. The majority of these studies have been carried out in Thailand as this is where the&#xD;
      plant originates from and it is used extensively in Thai massage and herbal medicine. The&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory activity of a compound found in Plai extracts was assessed and compared&#xD;
      with aspirin, and two other lesser known anti-inflammatory drugs. The results obtained showed&#xD;
      that the anti-inflammatory effect of the compound (compound D) mainly occurred in the acute&#xD;
      phase of inflammation.Moreover, the anti-inflammatory affect of plai oil was twice as potent&#xD;
      as Diclofenac. The Plai cream was shown to reduce swelling and pain significantly in athletic&#xD;
      ankle sprain in the first 2-3 days of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These findings suggest that topical plai cream is a safe and potentially useful drug for the&#xD;
      treatment of painful OA of the joints, however, there has been no efficacious study on the&#xD;
      plai cream namely Plaivana® for relieving symptoms in patient with OA knee joint before,&#xD;
      therefore, this study is proposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject selection and withdrawal criteria Number of subjects A sufficient number of subjects&#xD;
      with OA of the knee will be screened in order to randomize at least 100 subjects (100 pairs)&#xD;
      The study should provide 92 subjects (92 pairs) evaluable subjects, assuming that 10% of&#xD;
      subjects will withdraw before having one the last assessment in the primary outcome variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives Primary To evaluate the pain control using VAS of Plai cream 14 gm/100 (Plaivana®)&#xD;
      compared with placebo cream in patient with OA knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the WOMAC score of patients in the Plaivana® compared with the placebo&#xD;
           groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the amount of acetaminophen tablet taking in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the side effect of Plaivana® with the placebo. Investigational plane Study&#xD;
           Design This will be the phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled&#xD;
           cross-over trial of 12 weeks duration. This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
           of Plaivana® to placebo, in adults with OA of the knee. Randomization will be stratified&#xD;
           by Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grading (grade 2 and 3) using X-ray standing MTP technique. A&#xD;
           total of 100 subjects (100 pairs of subjects) are planned for enrollment in this study.&#xD;
           This study will be conducted over approximately 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods Patients and study design This was the phase III randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over trial of 12 weeks duration designed to evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy of Plaivana® to placebo, in adult with OA of the knee. A total of 100 subjects&#xD;
      (100 pairs of subjects) are planned for enrollment in this study. This was an 8 weeks period&#xD;
      of study treatment-control periods (4 weeks for treatment, two weeks for wash-out and 4 weeks&#xD;
      for placebo periods). The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki,&#xD;
      was approved by Khon Kaen University Ethics Committee for Human Research and informed consent&#xD;
      was obtained from all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study medication The essential plai cream has anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects&#xD;
      (Wasuwat1989, Giwanon 2000, Pithayanukul 2007, and Tripathi 2008). Active chemicals of plai&#xD;
      cream are composed of sabinene, alpha and gamma tepinenes, terpinen 4-ol and&#xD;
      (E)-1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl butadiene (DMPBD). The DMPBD has a property of anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      activity(Ozaki 1991, Jeenapongsa 2003). Plavina® 40 mg in 100 gm (contains DMPBD of …%). This&#xD;
      product was supplied in lacquered aluminum collapsible tube containing 100 gram cream&#xD;
      packing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Assignment and dosing Subjects will be assigned to study treatment in accordance&#xD;
      with the randomization schedule. Randomization will be stratified by KL grade (grade 2 or 3).&#xD;
      At the Baseline/Randomization Visit, each subject will be randomly assigned to either&#xD;
      Plaivana® or placebo creams. Plaivana® or placebo creams were applied three times around the&#xD;
      index knee. The 2 inches in length of cream was topically applied to the skin around the&#xD;
      index knee joint, then rubbing the cream until it dry. After applying the cream, patients&#xD;
      should wash their hands and do not touch their eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding This is a double-blind study. All study drugs will be blinded to the investigators&#xD;
      and subjects. The study and placebo creams were prepared in the same lacquered aluminum&#xD;
      collapsible tube containing 100 gram cream packing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Product Accountability In accordance with the standard requirements, the investigator must&#xD;
      document the amount of investigational cream product dispensed and /or administered to study&#xD;
      returned to the investigator. Product accountability records must be maintained throughout&#xD;
      the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Compliance A drug-dispensing log will be maintained by the investigator. Subjects&#xD;
      will be instructed at the baseline visit to record the dates on which they applied the cream&#xD;
      from each lacquered aluminum collapsible tube and to bring the tube with them on study visit&#xD;
      days. Subject compliance will be assessed based on the weight of returning tube, which will&#xD;
      be collected and recorded in the Data Record Form. Subject will be asked to complete a diary&#xD;
      card to capture daily applying doses of the cream.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concomitant Medications and Non-drug therapies Subject was asked to complete a diary card to&#xD;
      capture daily applying doses of the cream. Subject was asked to complete a diary to capture&#xD;
      takes and changes in concomitant therapy during the study, including pain medication or&#xD;
      nutritional supplements for OA related pain. Subjects were permitted to take acetaminophen&#xD;
      (500 mg) three times or two tablets for pain every 4-6 hours. Other topical analgesics, NSAID&#xD;
      and COX-2 inhibitors are prohibiting. All concomitant medications or nutritional supplement&#xD;
      taken during the study were also recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During wash-out period Subjects were permitted to take only acetaminophen for OA pain for 7&#xD;
      days. Subjects maintained written diaries to record dosing of medications and nutritional&#xD;
      supplements for OA-associated pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY ASSESSMENT AND PROCEDURES Subjects will be expected to attend the clinic a minimum of 6&#xD;
      times over period of approximately 12 weeks. The study consists of 7 phases: screen,&#xD;
      treatment, follow-up, washout, screening, treatment, and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study investigation will discuss with each subject in detail of the study objectives, its&#xD;
      requirement and its restrictions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The screening 1st visit will include a formal review of the complete medical history, all&#xD;
      concurrent medications, concomitant diseases, medication taken within the last month and all&#xD;
      medications of interested in the exclusion criteria, and other eligibility requirement for&#xD;
      the study including contraindication for plai cream.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subject will further be determined by exclusion criteria such as severe pain defined&#xD;
      as above 80 mm on the 100 mm VAS scale for pain, as identified by subject response to WOMAC&#xD;
      pain subscale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If OA present in both knees the investigator will identify which knee will be X-ray for the&#xD;
      study entry, with preference for the knee with more severe pain (&lt;80 mm on WOMAC pain sub&#xD;
      scale) A radiograph of the index knee will be obtained using the MTP technique to evaluate&#xD;
      JSW and KL grade. The minimum JSW must be at least 1.5 mm in the medial compartment and at&#xD;
      least 2.5 mm in the corresponding lateral compartment with KL grade of 2 or 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the screening 1st visit, subject should be instructed to withhold OA medication for pain&#xD;
      for 7 days for all NSAIDs or 24 hours for acetaminophen immediately prior to the baseline&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the 2nd visit subject will be randomized following stratification by KL grade. This visit,&#xD;
      the following procedures will be completed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  VAS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  WOMAC Subject will be received their first study or placebo cream, acetaminophen 500 mg&#xD;
           for 40 tablets and daily record their symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy Assessments Primary endpoint VAS: The primary endpoint is the change from baseline&#xD;
      in VAS. This endpoint will be measured at visit 2-13 (week 1-12) Secondary endpoint WOMAC&#xD;
      Score The WOMAC score is a tri-dimensional, disease-specific, self-administered health status&#xD;
      measure, probing clinically important, subject-relevant symptoms in the area of pain. The&#xD;
      subject will answer WOMAC question on pain subscale, using the Linkert scale 0-100 at&#xD;
      screening 1st visit to determine eligibility for inclusion in the study. The subject will&#xD;
      complete the entire WOMAC questionnaire during visit 2-13 (week 1-12) Safety Assessments&#xD;
      Adverse events The investigator will be responsible for detecting, documenting and reporting&#xD;
      events that meet the definition of adverse events. Definition of an adverse event is any&#xD;
      unfavorable or unintended sign (including a clinically significant abnormal laboratory&#xD;
      finding, for example; skin rash, swelling), symptom, or disease temporally associated with&#xD;
      the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered as an adverse event.Any adverse&#xD;
      event should be documented on the patient chart and reported on the Adverse Event Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dropouts Reason for dropout The patients may drop-out of the study if they decide to do so,&#xD;
      at any time and irrespective of the reason, or this may be the investigator decision. All&#xD;
      dropouts must be documented and the investigator must give the reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis and statistical considerations Sample size determination The primary endpoint&#xD;
      was the change from baseline in visual analog scale (VAS).The secondary endpoint was the&#xD;
      Western Ontario McMaster score (WOMAC). These endpoints were measured every week for 9 weeks&#xD;
      (4 weeks for each treatment periods and one week for washout period). This study is&#xD;
      determined to demonstrate that Plaivana® is able to reduce the pain (VAS), functional score&#xD;
      and stiffness score when compared to placebo cream. It is expected that Plaivana® will reduce&#xD;
      the VAS by 1.23 (which considers Minimal Clinical Improvement Important, MCII) and SD was&#xD;
      4.39. The significant level is 95% or alpha at 5% of two-sided test and power for detecting&#xD;
      different is 80% or beta at 20%. Therefore, the sample size of 103 pairs of patient is&#xD;
      needed. Adding 5% dropout rate, we would need approximately 108 pairs of patient (108&#xD;
      patients) to be randomized to each treatment group in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      N pairs = ½(1+1/λ)[(Z1-α/2+Z1-β)2/D2pair +( Z2 1-α/2)/2] Λ= number of controls:case = 1 D=&#xD;
      Effect size =VAS difference/SDof VAS The VAS difference which minimal clinical improvement&#xD;
      important was 1.23 and SDof VAS = 4.39, therefore the sample size was 103 pairs Hypothesis&#xD;
      testing The null hypothesis to be tested is that the VAS in Plaivana® group is not different&#xD;
      from the placebo group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis population The primary analysis will be based on patients on intent-to-treat (ITT)&#xD;
      population, which will include all patients with baseline results of VAS, WOMAC score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistic methods The mean different of VAS in Plaivana® and placebo be analyzed by Z test,&#xD;
      95% CI of the mean different of VAS. The confident interval of the mean of VAS in each&#xD;
      treatment group will be calculated. Other baseline factors such as WOMAC, Stiffness score and&#xD;
      acetaminophen used will be analyses by ANOVA, student T test and Mc Nemar 's Chi-square. All&#xD;
      statistical analyses were performed by using STATA Statistical Software: Release 10th.&#xD;
      (StataCorp. 2007. Stata Statistical Software: Release 10th. College Station, TX: SataCorp.)&#xD;
      Data Management The data collection will be done by research assistance using the DATA RECORD&#xD;
      FORM SHEATH. Clinical data management will perform in according with the Good Clinical&#xD;
      Practice Guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics The trial will be considered in accordance with: The Declaration of Helsinki adopted&#xD;
      by the World Medical Assembly in June 1964, amended at Tokyo in October 1975, at Venice in&#xD;
      October 1983 at Hong Kong in September 1989 and at Somerset West in October 1996.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before a subject included in the trial, the aims and methods of the trial are explained to&#xD;
      the subject. The subject givens his/her consent in writing on an information and informed&#xD;
      consent form. The investigator will submit the documents required by the regulations&#xD;
      according to the Ethics Committee of Khon Kaen University and will obtain their opinion in&#xD;
      writing. Subjects cannot be included until the approval of the Ethics Committee has been&#xD;
      received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality control-Quality assurance The investigator in charge of the study ensures the&#xD;
      efficient organization and good quality of the study, notably he is responsible for protocol&#xD;
      compliance, data collection and Good Clinical Practice in general. Data collection will be&#xD;
      monitored throughout the study by the monitors after quality control by the investigator.&#xD;
