      The purpose of this study is to collect additional safety data during treatment with&#xD;
      abiraterone acetate plus prednisone or prednisolone among adult participants with&#xD;
      asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC)&#xD;
      who reside in areas in which abiraterone acetate is not yet available for this indication&#xD;
      through local healthcare providers, and who are not eligible for enrollment into an available&#xD;
      ongoing clinical study of abiraterone acetate.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (identity of assigned study drug will be known) early access protocol&#xD;
      (EAP). Approximately 60 participants will be enrolled in this study. Participants will&#xD;
      receive abiraterone acetate 1000 mg daily plus prednisone or prednisolone 5 mg daily.&#xD;
      Treatment in 28-day cycles will continue until progression of clinical disease. Study drug&#xD;
      will be provided until the company obtains market authorization and reimbursement in the&#xD;
      participant countries for this indication.&#xD;
