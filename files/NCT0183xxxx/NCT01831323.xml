      To evaluate the effect of the probiotic formulation VSL#3 on the metabolome and microbiota of&#xD;
      diverticular disease, comparing it with the effects exerted by supplementation with fibers,&#xD;
      by rifaximin and by mesalazine, and assessing the evolution over time after each specific&#xD;
      treatment&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The incidence of diverticular disease of the colon has increased over the last few years.&#xD;
      Since it presents potentially severe complications (both in terms of morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality), the most recent studies are focusing on the underlying mechanisms and therapeutic&#xD;
      options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diverticular disease of the colon presents important etiopathogenetic events. The first is&#xD;
      that the severity of microscopic inflammation is correlated to the disease activity. The&#xD;
      second is the bacterial overgrowth which is observed in the colon, where the diverticula form&#xD;
      &quot;recesses&quot; where bacteria can proliferate. The third is that the &quot;metabolome&quot; plays an&#xD;
      important role in the pathogenesis of diseases of the gastrointestinal tract (and not only).&#xD;
      An extensive combination of microbial species live permanently in the human gut and&#xD;
      participate in the metabolic activities of the gastro-intestinal tract (such as the synthesis&#xD;
      of certain vitamins, improvement of the immune system, and balance of the resident bacterial&#xD;
      species). There is little published clinical evidence suggesting a direct link between&#xD;
      microbiota and diverticular disease; however, an altered microbiota in the flora of patients&#xD;
      with colon cancer, irritable bowel syndrome, and IBD has been described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is clear that human metabolism and inflammatory response are influenced by genetic&#xD;
      information outside our genome. Insights into the influence of microorganisms on the&#xD;
      pathogenesis in gastrointestinal function and diverticular disease are in their infancy and&#xD;
      often rely on extrapolation from other disease states. Microbiological analysis of fecal&#xD;
      microbiota can provide important information on the role that the microbial-mammalian axis&#xD;
      might have on the pathogenesis of diverticular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alteration of the metabolome play an important role in some pathologies of the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract, from Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) to Irritable Bowel Syndrome&#xD;
      (IBS). Most likely, it plays the same role in diverticular disease. In fact, the current&#xD;
      western diet is poor in fibers and can cause an alteration of the resident bacterial species,&#xD;
      with a reduction of bifidobacteria and an increase of clostridia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This alteration might be present in diverticular disease and the manipulation of the&#xD;
      microbial flora might represent both a treatment option for diverticular disease and the&#xD;
      prevention of its complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies showed that the treatment with probiotics can help reduce the activity index&#xD;
      in patients with DDS and as well as reduce the recurrence of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new method has now been validated to assess the microbiota: the analysis of the faecal and&#xD;
      urinary metabolome by high resolution Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The&#xD;
      microbioma is the combination of the DNA of the microorganisms that compose the intestinal&#xD;
      microflora (microbiota). Metabolomics allow to assess the metabolic activity of the&#xD;
      microbiota and its possible interactions with the host.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The metabolomic analyses of stools and urine offer a new approach to evaluate the metabolome&#xD;
      of diverticular disease, and compare it in patients who take a probiotic, fibers,&#xD;
      non-absorbable antibiotics or an anti-inflammatory drug.&#xD;

    <description>As no studies have ever been conducted or published on this aspect, the main outcome of the study is to analyze and identify the metabolome of patients with SUDD before starting any therapy and after a 2 week therapy of a probiotic, fibers or antibiotics. The metabolomic analysis will allow a precise evaluation of the systemic and organ-specific processes based on low molecular weight components thus providing a profile of the metabolic system of these patients.</description>
