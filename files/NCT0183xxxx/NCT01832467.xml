      To determine the objective overall response of re-treatment with cetuximab-based chemotherapy&#xD;
      in patients upon disease progression while under observation, who had previously responded to&#xD;
      first-line or second-line treatment with cetuximab-based chemotherapy for metastatic&#xD;
      colorectal cancer (mCRC), but had stopped treatment for reasons other than disease&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;

    <description>Cetuximab may be given at either one of the following schedules at the investigator's discretion:&#xD;
2-weekly: Cetuximab is started on day 1 of each cycle of chemotherapy, at 500mg/m2 every 2 weeks over 120/90/60minutes.&#xD;
Weekly: Cetuximab may be given at a loading dose of 400mg/m2 on day 1over 120 minutes, followed by weekly dosing at 250mg/m2 on day 1, over 60 minutes of each cycle of chemotherapy.&#xD;
Chemotherapy: Only one of the following regimens may be combined with cetuximab at the investigator's discretion according to institutional standard. Some recommended regimens used in Hong Kong.&#xD;
Regimens to be combined with biweekly cetuximab:&#xD;
Irinotecan at 2-weekly schedule.&#xD;
FOLFIRI (as inpatient or via ambulatory pump).&#xD;
FOLFOX (as inpatient or via ambulatory pump).</description>
