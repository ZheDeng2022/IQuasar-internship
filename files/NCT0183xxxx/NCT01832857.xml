  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase II study is conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of CPI-613 in patients&#xD;
      with advanced and/or metastatic solid tumors for whom there there is no available therapy to&#xD;
      provide clinical benefit or for those who have refused further standard therapy. The primary&#xD;
      outcome measure is Overall Survival (OS). The secondary outcome measures are: Response Rate&#xD;
      (RR), Progression-Free Survival (PFS), and safety.&#xD;

      Open-Label Single-Arm Design: This is an open-label study, and investigators and subjects are&#xD;
      not blinded to the treatment. Also, the assignment of patients will not be randomized, since&#xD;
      this is a single-arm study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with CPI-613: A treatment cycle is 4 weeks, with CPI-613 given on Days 1 and 4 of&#xD;
      the first 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose and Sample Size: The dose of CPI-613 is 3,000 mg/m2. This is Maximum Tolerated Dose&#xD;
      (MTD) determined from the Phase I dose-escalated trial, Study# CL-CPI-613-009 (conducted in&#xD;
      patients with hematologic malignancies under IND 107,800). This dose has also been found to&#xD;
      be well tolerated in another Phase I dose-escalated trial, Study# CL-CPI-613-002 (conducted&#xD;
      in patients with solid tumor under IND 74,530). There will be 20 evaluable patients with each&#xD;
      tumor type. Once there are 20 evaluable patients with a particular tumor type has been&#xD;
      treated with at least 1 cycle, no patients of the same tumor type will be accrued. Dosing&#xD;
      Delay and Dose Modification of CPI-613 in the Event of Adverse Events: For adverse events&#xD;
      unrelated to serum creatinine elevation or reduction in renal function but are possibly&#xD;
      related to CPI-613, the occurrence of Grade 1 toxicity does not generally require dose&#xD;
      modification for subsequent doses for that patient. However, if Grade 2 toxicity (other than&#xD;
      alopecia and nausea) probably related to CPI-613 develops, treatment is to be withheld and&#xD;
      can resume only after the Grade 2 toxicity has been reduced to Grade 1 or below, and the dose&#xD;
      level for subsequent doses for that patient will be reduced by 25% of the dose at which such&#xD;
      Grade 2 toxicity occurs. Grade 2 alopecia and nausea do not require withholding treatment or&#xD;
      dose reduction. If Grade 3 or 4 toxicity probably related to CPI-613 develops, dosing of&#xD;
      CPI-613 of that patient will be withheld and the patient shall be monitored for recovery&#xD;
      from, and reversibility of, such Grade 3 or 4 toxicity. To resume treatment with CPI-613 for&#xD;
      a patient who has had CPI-613-related Grade 3 or 4 toxicity, the Grade 3 or 4 toxicity must&#xD;
      be reduced to Grade 1 or below, and the dose level for subsequent doses for that patient will&#xD;
      be reduced to 50% of the dose at which such Grade 3 or 4 toxicity occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For adverse events related to creatinine elevation or reduction in renal function that are&#xD;
      possibly related to CPI-613, dosing of the patient will be withheld even if the severity&#xD;
      level is Grade 1 or above. Treatment can resume only after the toxicity has been reduced to&#xD;
      Grade 0. The dose level for subsequent doses for that patient will be reduced by 15% if the&#xD;
      severity level is of Grade 1, by 25% for Grade 2 toxicity, and by 50% for Grade 3 or 4&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, if the toxicity possibly related to CPI-613 is acute renal failure and the&#xD;
      severity level is Grade 3 or 4, further patient enrollment will be temporarily suspended in&#xD;
      order to enable assessment of the following aspects of the trial and implementation of&#xD;
      corrective measures or protocol amendment, and if necessary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  compliance of the study sites and investigators to the study protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  evaluation of the appropriateness of the procedures for monitoring renal function&#xD;

    <description>This arm is for patients that have failed, or are not eligible for, all available therapies. CPI-613 drug product, provided in concentrated form at 50 mg/mL, must be diluted with D5W prior to administration. CPI-613 is to be infused intravenously (IV) via a central venous catheter. CPI-613 will be given 2x weekly, administered on Days 1 and 4 of each of the 3 treatment weeks, followed by a week of rest. The dose of CPI-613 will be 3,000 mg/m2 infused IV over 2 hours (this is the maximum tolerated dosing [MTD]), via a central venous catheter with D5W running at a rate of about 125-150 mL/hr.</description>
