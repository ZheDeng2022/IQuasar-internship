      The purpose of this study is to investigate how blood sugar changes in response to insulin&#xD;
      and what the body does to counter-act low blood sugar in people with Type 1 Diabetes&#xD;
      Mellitus. Insulin sensitivity is the term used to describe blood sugar changes within the&#xD;
      body in response to insulin. Greater understanding of insulin sensitivity, particularly how&#xD;
      the body responds to low blood sugar, will help us to better predict how blood sugar levels&#xD;
      will change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will receive a liquid mixed-meal and will have their blood sugar response&#xD;
      monitored in order to study insulin sensitivity. All subjects will receive additional insulin&#xD;
      injections that are given to cause a low blood sugar in order to understand how the body&#xD;
      responds to a low blood sugar. All subjects will be closely monitored during the time the&#xD;
      insulin is given, by frequent checks of blood sugar and constant medical and nursing&#xD;
      supervision. Details of the visits, tests and procedures are described below. During this&#xD;
      study, the study team will ask that subjects to use their own insulin pump and own&#xD;
      glucometer. Subjects will need to use the same glucometer for the entire study. Subjects will&#xD;
      be provided 1 box of strips. Subjects will be required to use lispro (Humalog) insulin 2-3&#xD;
      days before your inpatient admission which will be provided free of charge.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Glucose variability (GV) in type 1 diabetes (T1DM) is increasingly viewed as a primary marker&#xD;
      of glycemic control, responsible, along with chronic hyperglycemia reflected by HbA1c, for&#xD;
      diabetes complications. In this study, we propose to investigate: (i) the time course of&#xD;
      deterioration of physiological glucoregulatory mechanisms leading to increased GV, and (ii)&#xD;
      the association of GV with metabolic and behavioral factors such as insulin sensitivity and&#xD;
      treatment adequacy. Our primary hypothesis is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glucose variability in T1DM is triggered by behavioral events (e.g. meals, insulin injection,&#xD;
      exercise) that challenge the metabolic system. The timing and the magnitude of the behavioral&#xD;
      challenges, and the ability of the metabolic mechanisms to absorb these challenges, determine&#xD;
      the magnitude of GV. This process develops in a certain time frame, and can be accelerated by&#xD;
      inadequate treatment, or attenuated by precise timing and dosing of bio-behavioral control.&#xD;
      This study will use a combination of treatment records, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM),&#xD;
      and an inpatient admission to clarify the relationships between behavioral challenges to the&#xD;
      metabolic system, physiological glucoregulatory mechanisms, and GV. This study will test the&#xD;
      following hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Suboptimal treatment behavior, e.g. insulin mistiming (early/late meal insulin) or&#xD;
           unbalanced insulin (higher basal/bolus ratio), is correlated with higher GV and repeated&#xD;
           hypo- and hyperglycemia; this relationship is mediated by a patients' insulin&#xD;
           sensitivity;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A metabolic challenge (e.g. consecutive sequence of hypo- and hyperglycemia), will push&#xD;
           the metabolic system into a transient super-critical state characterized by increased GV&#xD;
           as defined by the Variability Grid Analysis (VGA) and the Average Daily Risk Range&#xD;
           (ADRR), which will persist for several days beyond the discontinuation of the challenge.&#xD;

    <description>The study procedures will start after CGM device training &amp; practice using the blinded CGM for 2 days and will continue over the course of ~33 days. The study team will collect data about diabetes management including blood glucose data from fingerstick and CGM values along with insulin pump records throughout the 4 week observation period. Insulin sensitivity will be evaluated at home with predetermined meals' carbohydrate count. At the mid-study point glucose variability will be simulated in clinic with a metabolic challenge (liquid mixed meal) followed 4 hours later by the induction of hypoglycemia with an intravenous insulin injection. Insulin sensitivity, as well as glucagon and epinephrine counterregulatory responses will be evaluated to be related to overall Glucose Variability.</description>

After carbohydrate rescue, the subject will receive a meal and will be monitored until glucose is stable above 80 mg/dl.</description>
