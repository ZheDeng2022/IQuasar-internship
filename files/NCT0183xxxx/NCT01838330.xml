    <textblock>
      Loss of kidney function results in accumulation in the blood of molecules that are either&#xD;
      excreted or metabolized by the kidney. Collectively, these molecules are termed Uremic&#xD;
      Retention Molecules (URMs) or toxins. It is increasingly recognized that colonic bacterial&#xD;
      metabolites like p-cresyl sulfate and indoxyl sulfate that are absorbed from the colon and&#xD;
      excreted by the kidney may contribute to the pool of compounds implied in uremic toxicity.&#xD;
      Indeed, these URMs have been linked to increased levels of inflammation markers, chronic&#xD;
      kidney disease (CKD) progression, cardiovascular disease and overall mortality in CKD and/ or&#xD;
      hemodialysis patients. Therefore, interventions that target the production or absorption of&#xD;
      URMs from the gut might decrease inflammation and oxidative stress that are commonly seen in&#xD;
      the uremic milieu. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III (NHANES III) data&#xD;
      show that high dietary fiber intake is associated with decreased serum levels of C-reactive&#xD;
      protein (CRP) in those with and without CKD and these associations are much stronger in the&#xD;
      CKD population. A possible explanation of this effect is that a high fiber diet in CKD&#xD;
      patients modulates the bacterial production, intestinal absorption and finally the serum&#xD;
      levels of URMs like p-cresyl sulfate and indoxyl sulfate, which in turn results in decrease&#xD;
      in inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Higher serum levels of markers of inflammation such as high sensitivity C-reactive&#xD;
           protein (hsCRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α seen in stage 4&#xD;
           CKD (estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate 15-29 ml/min/1.73 m2) compared to stage 2 CKD&#xD;
           (estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate 60-89 ml/min/1.73 m2) is partly explained by the&#xD;
           higher circulating levels of URMs (p-cresyl sulfate and indoxyl sulfate) in stage 4 CKD,&#xD;
           and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Dietary supplementation in stage 4 CKD with 30g/d of a soluble fiber Psyllium (brand&#xD;
           name-Metamucil TM) will decrease circulating URMs levels and thereby, decrease serum&#xD;
           levels of inflammation markers and urinary levels of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β,&#xD;
           a marker of kidney fibrosis.&#xD;
