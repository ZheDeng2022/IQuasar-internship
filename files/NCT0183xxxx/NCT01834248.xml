      This phase I trial studies the side effects and immune response to DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion&#xD;
      protein CDX-1401 and decitabine in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid&#xD;
      leukemia. DEC-205-NY-ESO-1 fusion protein, called CDX-1401, is a full length NY-ESO-1 protein&#xD;
      sequence fused to a monoclonal antibody against DEC-205, a surface marker present on many&#xD;
      immune stimulatory cells. This drug is given with another substance called PolyICLC, which&#xD;
      acts to provoke any immune stimulatory cells which encounter the NY-ESO-1-DEC-205 fusion&#xD;
      protein to produce an immune response signal against NY-ESO-1. Immune cells which have thus&#xD;
      been primed to react against NY-ESO-1 may then attack myelodysplastic or leukemic cells which&#xD;
      express NY-ESO-1 after exposure to the drug decitabine. The chemotherapy drug decitabine is&#xD;
      thought to act in several different ways, first, it may directly kill cancer cells, and&#xD;
      secondly, the drug can cause cancer cells to re-express genes that are turned off by the&#xD;
      cancer, including the gene for NY-ESO-1. Giving DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion protein (CDX-1401)&#xD;
      and polyICLC together with decitabine may allow the immune system to more effectively&#xD;
      recognize cancer cells and kill them.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the safety of Anti-DEC-205-NY-ESOI (CDX-1401) fusion protein (DEC-205/NY-ESO-1&#xD;
      fusion protein CDX-1401) given in combination with decitabine 20 mg/m^2 intravenously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate NY-ESO-1 specific cellular and humoral immunity by determination of NY-ESO-1&#xD;
      specific antibody, and T-cell clones following standard treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine&#xD;
      (decitabine) in conjunction with immune sensitization with Anti-DEC 205-NY-ESO-I fusion&#xD;
      protein (CDX-1401).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the impact of decitabine treatment on peripheral blood cells from patients&#xD;
      treated in this manner on NY-ESO-1 target gene expression, NY-ESO protein expression,&#xD;
      NY-ESO-1 promoter methylation, and global deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To record the response rate (complete response, partial response and hematological&#xD;
      improvement) in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or low blast count acute myeloid leukemia&#xD;
      (AML) patients treated with the combination in order to provide descriptive characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion protein CDX-1401 subcutaneously (SC) and&#xD;
      intradermally (ID) and poly-ICLC subcutaneously (SC) on days -14 and 15 of course 1 and on&#xD;
      day 15 for courses 2-4. Patients also receive decitabine intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on&#xD;
      days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30, 60, 90, and 180 days.&#xD;
