      Background: There are no published studies regarding the use of wound protectors in the&#xD;
      context of surgical site infection (SSI) rates among patients receiving a&#xD;
      pancreatoduodenectomy (Whipple) with preoperatively placed intrabiliary stents. In high&#xD;
      volume experiences, the SSI rate is 40-50% within this cohort. In Calgary, preoperative&#xD;
      biliary stent placement for bile duct decompression represents the norm given typical&#xD;
      surgical wait times. In addition to having higher associated lengths of hospital stay, ICU&#xD;
      admissions, hospital re-admissions, and overall mortality, patients with SSI are also&#xD;
      delayed, and often omitted, in their progression to critical oncologic adjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;
      As a result, SSI remain crucial and devastating complications for pancreas surgeons and their&#xD;
      patients alike.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The investigators will complete a randomized controlled trial evaluating the rate of&#xD;
      SSI in adult patients who undergo a pancreatoduodenectomy following biliary stent placement&#xD;
      when wound protectors are employed versus no wound protector use. This trial will employ&#xD;
      block randomization. All four University of Calgary Heapato-Pancreatico-Biliary (HPB)&#xD;
      surgeons will participate with a planned inclusion of all patients scheduled to undergo a&#xD;
      pancreatoduodenectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis: The investigators will use an intention to treat approach to the analysis.&#xD;
      Categorical baseline data will be analyzed using the Fisher exact probability test.&#xD;
      Non-categorical baseline data will be analyzed using the Student t test. SSI rates will be&#xD;
      determined using the Fisher exact probability test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Wound protectors will reduce the SSI rate in patients undergoing a&#xD;
      pancreatoduodenectomy with preoperatively placed intrabiliary stents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Impact: Given the tremendous oncologic, economic, and psychological impact of SSI&#xD;
      following pancreatoduodenectomy, the epidemic incidence of this complication must be reduced.&#xD;
      The additional crippling effect of refusing (Medicare) payment for any patient who receives a&#xD;
      SSI in the United States has launched all techniques and analyses that can potentially reduce&#xD;
      this complication into the National health care agenda. In Canada, health care utilization&#xD;
      and economics are always a relevant and ever expanding area of importance. It is crucial that&#xD;
      the investigators reduce complications such as SSI, regardless of individual payer sources.&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Department of Surgery at the University of Calgary has a long and proud tradition of&#xD;
      research surrounding surgical site infections (SSI). More specifically, former surgeon and&#xD;
      Department Chair Dr. Peter Cruse prospectively studied 23,649 surgical wounds following&#xD;
      operative intervention. This massive study remains unmatched in size by a single institution&#xD;
      publication. Dr. Cruse and Ms. Rosemary Foord demonstrated a decrease in SSI rates with the&#xD;
      pre-surgical use of hexachlorophene wash and by not shaving the surgical site1. They observed&#xD;
      an increase in SSI rates with advanced age, use of drains, prolonged hospital stay before the&#xD;
      operation, and longer operative times. Dr. Cruse is directly responsible for confirming the&#xD;
      validity of the wound classification system currently in use throughout the world (clean,&#xD;
      clean-contaminated, contaminated, and dirty). We propose to carry on the tradition of this&#xD;
      line of investigation, reinforcing Calgary as a world leader in SSI research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SSI are a frequent and costly source of post-operative morbidity. They are the most common&#xD;
      complication following gastrointestinal and biliary tract surgery, occurring in 5-30% of&#xD;
      patients. SSI are associated with a two-fold increased risk of in-hospital mortality, a 50%&#xD;
      increase in intensive care admission, a 6-day mean increase in hospital stay, and a five-fold&#xD;
      increased rate of readmission. SSI also have additional and highly negative consequences in&#xD;
      the treatment of oncology patients. More specifically, medical oncologists wait until all&#xD;
      operative wounds are entirely healed prior to beginning adjuvant chemotherapy. This delay is&#xD;
      both oncologically concerning, as well as psychologically destructive to highly stressed&#xD;
      patients with poor associated survivals. Furthermore, with a significant SSI, this delay&#xD;
      often leads to a total omission of adjuvant therapies as a whole. The estimated increased&#xD;
      cost per SSI ranges from $1,300 to $5,000 in the United States. In Canada, a 1998 study&#xD;
      estimated $3,937 per infection, resulting from increased hospital stay, as well as emergency&#xD;
      department and clinic visits. The implications of these costs have now become paramount given&#xD;
      that both U.S. Medicare and Medicaid currently deny any reimbursement for patients who obtain&#xD;
      an SSI while admitted to hospital. In addition, patients who develop SSI experience&#xD;
      psychosocial distress, loss of income, and loss of productivity. Prevention of SSI is&#xD;
      therefore a vitally important goal in delivering quality care to patients. The SSI rate is&#xD;
      40-50% in patients undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy with intrabiliary stents, the population&#xD;
      of interest for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wound protectors are devices designed to protect the abdominal wound tissue edges from&#xD;
      contamination and trauma during laparotomy. A major reason for their conception and use is a&#xD;
      theoretical reduction in risk of SSI. Various devices with similar intent have been described&#xD;
      since the 1960s, falling into two main design categories: (1) Those with an internal and&#xD;
      external ring connected by impervious plastic, and (2) Those with a single, internal ring&#xD;
      connected to a drape which extends outward, over the wound edges and onto the abdomen where&#xD;
      they are affixed with adhesive or clips.A recent meta-analysis of randomized controlled&#xD;
      trials was conducted by a team led by the Principal Investigator to evaluate whether&#xD;
      impervious plastic wound protectors reduce the risk of surgical site infection following&#xD;
      gastrointestinal and biliary surgery. Six studies representing 1,008 patients were included.&#xD;
      Wound protectors were associated with a 45% decrease in SSI (p = 0.04). The Alexis Wound&#xD;
      Protector, a ring based model, had evidence of superiority to other products and has been&#xD;
      selected for this study based on this finding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: Contact information for study candidates will be obtained by the project's&#xD;
      research fellow from the offices of the participating (4) surgeons. Patients will be&#xD;
      contacted prior to their surgery by the research fellow and will be provided information&#xD;
      regarding the study. Patients who consent to participate will be randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization process: This study is a simple, two-arm randomized clinical trial (RCT) with&#xD;
      block randomization. Allocation will be concealed before the patient enters study. Patients&#xD;
      will be randomized by the Research fellow following consent. Allocation will be provided to&#xD;
      surgeon in a sealed envelope to be opened immediately before surgery. Patients and the data&#xD;
      analyst will be blind to allocation; the surgeons cannot be blinded. Charts will be blinded&#xD;
      for data abstraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: Information will be collected by chart review from the operative report and&#xD;
      patient records by the research fellow in the Department of Surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data elements to be collected include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Date of birth, Sex, American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) score, Surgeon, Site (if more&#xD;
      than one facility), Fellow/resident/clerk present (y/n), Surgical procedure, Antibiotic&#xD;
      prophylaxis received (y/n) and time given, Information about repeat antibiotic prophylaxis&#xD;
      (for longer surgeries), Antibiotic type/combination, Type of wound protector and&#xD;
      manufacturer, Prep type (ETOH based, chlorhexidine based, iodine based), Hair removal,&#xD;
      Medications given, Packing, Drains, Wound classification, Wound closure technique &amp; dressing&#xD;
      type, Length of surgery, Surgical suite infection control factors (e.g. UV, OR ventilation)&#xD;
      if these differ, Transfusions,&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient records:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current use of corticosteroids/immune suppressant, Preoperative chemotherapy, Smoking&#xD;
      history, Co-morbidities (diabetes, hypertension, etc.), Body Mass Index (BMI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of an SSI will be determined according to guidelines developed by the Centers&#xD;
      for Disease Control. More specifically, SSI is defined as being the presence of at least one&#xD;
      of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Purulent drainage, with or without laboratory conformation, from the superficial&#xD;
           incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Organisms isolated from an aseptically obtained culture of fluid from the superficial&#xD;
           incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. At least one of the following signs or symptoms of infection:&#xD;
&#xD;
           pain or tenderness, localized swelling, redness and superficial incision is deliberately&#xD;
           opened by surgeon, unless incision is culture-negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Diagnosis of superficial incisional SSI by the surgeon or attending physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use an intention to treat approach to the analysis to avoid the effects of crossover&#xD;
      and dropout. To achieve a power (superiority trial) of 90%, and alpha of 0.05 with a 5%&#xD;
      crossover and a 40% expected SSI rate in control versus 10% in wound protector groups, the&#xD;
      total sample size is 78 (i.e. 39 in each arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resources&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will capitalize on an existing research team who can work collaboratively with&#xD;
      the Principal Investigator and research assistant to carry out the project effectively and&#xD;
      efficiently. The current research team includes a clinical research fellow with experience&#xD;
      recruiting research participants from this patient population and a project manager who can&#xD;
      assist with ethics applications, manuscript writing and reporting. Additionally, the&#xD;
      Principal Investigator will benefit from mentorship by an experienced investigator who can&#xD;
      provide guidance not only on methodology, interpretation of data and publication strategies,&#xD;
      but also on the day-to-day logistics of running a research project.&#xD;
