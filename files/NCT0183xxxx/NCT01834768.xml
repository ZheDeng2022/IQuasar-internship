  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kidney transplant recipients usually lose their graft by rejection or by immunosuppressive&#xD;
      drugs toxicity. In kidney transplantation, calcineurin-inhibitors (including cyclosporine A)&#xD;
      are widely used. Their renal toxicity could be divided between an acute toxicity (toxic&#xD;
      arteriolopathy and toxic tubulopathy) and a chronic toxicity (hyaline arteriolopathy,&#xD;
      interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy and glomerulosclerosis). Several animal models have&#xD;
      shown the implication of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) activation in those toxic&#xD;
      phenomenons. The use of a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist is useful regarding to the&#xD;
      renal function and kidney histological damages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several antagonists are available in France but none is indicated in kidney transplantation.&#xD;
      Eplerenone appears to be the most selective molecule of the mineralocorticoid receptor and to&#xD;
      have less adverse anti-androgenic effects than others molecules. Its principal adverse events&#xD;
      are hyperkalemia and orthostatic hypotension. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists,&#xD;
      especially eplerenone, could be very useful in the prevention of the nephrotoxicity induced&#xD;
      by calcineurin-inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Classically, eplerenone is contra-indicated in patients presenting with an impaired renal&#xD;
      function, determined by a creatinine clearance under 50mL/min. Moreover, in France, a warning&#xD;
      is especially notified for the association with cyclosporine A due to the fact that no study&#xD;
      have been done in this context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators study first the safety of the use of eplerenone in association with&#xD;
      cyclosporine A in kidney transplant recipients. Then, if it is safe, the investigators will&#xD;
      study its efficiency in a large randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
