&#xD;
      Background :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spontaneous brain hemorrhage is one of the most difficult issues in strokes concept regarding&#xD;
      underlying pathology, reasons and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Etiology:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General prevalence of about approximately 10-15% in all strokes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mortality and morbidity associated with it are the most severe with mortality rates of&#xD;
           up to 50-60%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are various pathologies thought to be responsible for bleeding, most commonly known to&#xD;
      be :&#xD;
&#xD;
      hypertension, Angiopathies, amyloidotic or vascular problems and space occupying lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment process that takes place is very limited and most patients are treated only&#xD;
      conservatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cytotoxic brain edema that develops around the bleeding results usually from local cell&#xD;
      damage and local pressure. It usually increases in the first days after bleeding and is&#xD;
      considered to be one of the main causes of deterioration after cerebral hemorrhage .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-dural cerebral hemorrhage is a common disease due to traumatic injury, often with serious&#xD;
      consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the natural history of subdural bleeding, not only It's believed to be difficult&#xD;
      predicting the bleeding's course, but the risk to induce cerebral edema and later on to&#xD;
      develop into chronic sub Dural bleeding is unpredictable as well .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless chronic sub-dural bleeding is one of the most common cases seen in neurosurgery&#xD;
      practice, But worthy to notify that only little is known about the pathogenesis of the&#xD;
      disease, appearance of symptoms , preferable time for drainage and its complications .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although hasn't been contributing much in clinical evaluation of stoke, MRI has a growing&#xD;
      importance in the field of stroke lately .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a previous neuro-imaging research that included patients after ischemic stroke it was&#xD;
      shown that with an innovative methodology based on leakage extravasation) contrast agent in&#xD;
      MRI which allows to map the entire brain with high resolution, we can easily evaluate the&#xD;
      sensitivity disorder in BBB .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 27% of patients who showed no anomalies at BBB in normal MRI, calculated maps with late&#xD;
      leakage showed significant volumes of BBB opening ischemic areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI research Group in the Advanced Technology Center of the Sheba Medical Center has&#xD;
      developed an innovative methodology based on leakage (extravasation) contrast agent that&#xD;
      allows to map the entire brain with high resolution and high sensitivity to check and&#xD;
      describe disorders BBB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Acquisition:&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI will be performed using the General Electric (GE) T3.0/1.5 with a standard head coil of 8&#xD;
      channels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI scans will include high-resolution spin-echo T1-weighted MRI , acquired before and at&#xD;
      several time points after injection (1, 12, 20, 23, 30, 70 minutes after injection).&#xD;
&#xD;
      T1-MRI may be done with Echo Time (TE) / Repetition Time (TR) = 22/240 ms, field of view 26 x&#xD;
      19.5 inch, 5/0.5 mm slice thickness and 512x512 - pixels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To notify : T1-MRI data is acquired simultaneously with any conventional imaging protocol&#xD;
      accepted at Sheba Medical center by routine practice. (Sheba's routine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective feasibility study performed on a group of patients with cerebral hemorrhage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess the ability to characterize quantitatively the BBB disruption around cerebral&#xD;
           hemorrhage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Find a correlation between the degree of BBBD immediately after bleeding and cerebral&#xD;
           edema 3-5 days after bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Search for clinical correlation between the degree of BBBD immediately after the&#xD;
           bleeding and the clinical course that follows it later on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective study aimed to test the feasibility of using BBBD protocol in MRI in&#xD;
      order to predict the development of edema and clinical deterioration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Course of the experiment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the -on call- neurosurgery resident is notified about a patient with spontaneous ICH he&#xD;
      would contact any of the researchers to begin the screening process for participation in the&#xD;
      study. Patients who had undergone intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) that was discovered in the&#xD;
      past twelve hours will undergo a screening process performed by any of the researchers in&#xD;
      order to determine whether or not they meet the inclusion criteria. Such patients may arrive&#xD;
      from the emergency room, intensive care unit or any of the other wards in the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. An initial Baseline MRI is to be done:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. for spontaneous ICH bleeding - within 6-24 hours from the bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. for chronic sub dural bleeding - at the time of diagnosis .&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. for acute sub-dural bleeding - within 6-24 hours from the bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It should be emphasized that the purpose of the MRI is to assess the extent of BBBD and is&#xD;
      intended for research purposes only. This MRI protocol does not allow complete diagnostic&#xD;
      assessment. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whether the patient needs an accompanying doctor while in MRI or not, is solely determined by&#xD;
      a researcher, depending on the patient's clinical situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Clinical follow-up : neurological status, registration of National Institutes of Health&#xD;
      Stroke Scale (NIHSS questionnaire).&#xD;
&#xD;
      a- for spontaneous bleeding - Daily monitoring &amp; registering National Institutes of Health&#xD;
      Stroke Scale (NIHSS) for five consequent days. Additional clinical follow-up will be&#xD;
      performed two weeks later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      b- for chronic or acute sub-dural bleeding follow up visit after 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. second MRI which serves as review :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. for spontaneous intra-cranial bleeding: on the 3rd -5th day after bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. For chronic sub Dural bleeding : within two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. For acute sub Dural bleeding: within two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
           6. Two months later, third MRI will be reviewed for all types of bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
           7. Result - Analysis of the outcomes as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Search correlation between BBBD and clinical status. Search BBBD correlation with&#xD;
           hematoma growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Search correlation between BBBD and the development of cerebral edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Search correlation between BBBD and growth process of Chronic Subdural Hematoma (CSDH)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Search correlation between BBBD and the drainage of CSDH.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Search correlation between BBBD while Acute Subdural Hematoma (ASDH) is converted to&#xD;
           CSDH.&#xD;
