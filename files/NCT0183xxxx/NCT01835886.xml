      Protocol Title: The Reliability and Validity of the Timed Stair Climbing Test (TSCT) as an&#xD;
      Outcome Measure in Individuals with Pulmonary Disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background An important part of pulmonary rehabilitation is the ability to document progress.&#xD;
      Commonly used outcome measures include walking tests like the Six Minute Walk Test (6MWT) and&#xD;
      the Shuttle Walk Test, MET levels and questionnaires. A recent study by Annegarn1 et al.,&#xD;
      analyzed responses from 820 Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients. While 35%&#xD;
      of respondents cited stair climbing as a problematic Activity of Daily Living (ADL), there&#xD;
      are very few studies looking at stair climbing ability as an outcome measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step tests using a riser and metronome have long been used as a fitness measure for healthy&#xD;
      subjects but can be challenging to administer to a non healthy population and do not mimic&#xD;
      the challenge of actually mounting a series of steps. Many of the existing stair climbing&#xD;
      studies which use actual stairs for testing are distance based and examine stair climbing as&#xD;
      a predictor for outcomes following lung surgery. One study conducted by Randolph2 et al.,&#xD;
      attempted to compare stair climbing ability and Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs) as predictors&#xD;
      of post-thoracotomy outcomes. Brunelli3 et al., looked at stair climbing as a useful&#xD;
      predictor of cardiopulmonary complications following lung resection. Both studies concluded&#xD;
      that the stair climbing test was clinically useful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bean4 developed a stair climbing test called the Stair Climb Power Test that incorporated an&#xD;
      element of time by asking subjects to climb a staircase of ten stairs as quickly and safely&#xD;
      as possible and looked at the relationship between muscle strength and functional&#xD;
      performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Six Minute Walk Test is well established as a valid and reliable outcome measure for this&#xD;
      population5. A study by Dreher6 et al., in 2008 attempted to compare a stair climbing test&#xD;
      with the Six Minute Walk Test. Using a randomized cross-over design, they looked at sixteen&#xD;
      COPD patients and found that pathophysiological changes during a six minute walk test did not&#xD;
      anticipate changes found during stair climbing in patients with severe COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of this points to the fact that a timed stair climbing test has the potential to serve as&#xD;
      a unique and valuable outcome measure for patients with respiratory compromise. It is well&#xD;
      understood that many people with pulmonary disease, especially those who live in urban areas,&#xD;
      unavoidably encounter stairs. While the six minute walk test requires at minimum a long&#xD;
      straight hallway with a hard surface for administration7 even that is not always readily&#xD;
      available. The Timed Stair Climbing Test could provide an outcome measure that is easily&#xD;
      administered and could be utilized in outpatient and inpatient settings as well as in the&#xD;
      home environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questions Addressed Is the Timed Stair Climbing Test a reliable and valid measure to use to&#xD;
      assess endurance in individuals with pulmonary disease when compared to 6MWT?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design Methodological Research design to establish validity and reliability of the&#xD;
      Timed Stair Climbing Test will be used. Test scores from 6MWT and TSCT will be compared,&#xD;
      using patients with documented pulmonary disease who participate in pulmonary rehabilitation.&#xD;
      All testing will take place on the premises of The Alice Lawrence Center for Health and&#xD;
      Rehabilitation located on the third floor of the Linsky Building, Petrie Campus of Beth&#xD;
      Israel Medical Center at First Ave and 16th Street in New York City. Screening of subjects&#xD;
      and test administration will be conducted by investigators and will be limited to staff&#xD;
      members who are licensed Physical Therapists or Exercise Physiologists with ACLS&#xD;
      certification operating under the supervision of Dr. Jonathan Raskin, MD, director of the&#xD;
      center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration of the 6MWT is currently part of the usual standard of care for pulmonary&#xD;
      rehabilitation patients attending the center. It is performed twice, one on evaluation and&#xD;
      once later towards the end of a person's series of sessions. American Thoracic Society&#xD;
      guidelines for administering the 6MWT will be followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Timed Stair Climbing Test will be added to subject's initial evaluations and discharge&#xD;
      sessions for research purposes. For the TSCT patients will be supervised while ascending and&#xD;
      descending a flight of 10 steps with 7 inch risers for 30 seconds as timed by a stop watch.&#xD;
      Number of steps achieved, oxygen saturation, rate of perceived exertion, dyspnea, heart rate&#xD;
      and use or non-use of a hand rail will be recorded. Vital signs will be continuously&#xD;
      monitored. As with the 6MWT, subjects will be allowed to use supplemental oxygen if it has&#xD;
      been prescribed for them. Whether the test was performed on room air or with supplemental&#xD;
      oxygen will be recorded in the test results. Oxygen delivery system and level of oxygen flow&#xD;
      and how equipment was managed will also be recorded in the test results. Subjects will have&#xD;
      the option of relying on any assistive devices to which they are accustomed and use or non&#xD;
      use of canes, handrails, orthoses etc will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be deemed fit to attempt the stair climbing task by the investigators only if&#xD;
      they are in no apparent distress, have a resting heart rate above 50 and below 120, resting&#xD;
      blood pressure above 90/50 and below 150/90 and no complaints of pain or dyspnea greater than&#xD;
      2/10 at rest and an oxygen saturation level greater than 90% at rest as measured by pulse&#xD;
      oximeter. The test will be terminated after 30 seconds or in the event of complaints of pain&#xD;
      or dyspnea greater than 4/10, an increase in heart rate greater than 40 beats over resting or&#xD;
      a decrease in oxygen saturation to below 86% or at any time at the request of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria: This study will include patients with documented pulmonary disease who&#xD;
      underwent a course of pulmonary rehabilitation at The Alice Lawrence Center for Health and&#xD;
      Rehabilitation consisting of 10 or more sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria: The following will be excluded from the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients who are unable to perform a follow-up 6MWT or TSCT or who are lost to&#xD;
           follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients who have orthopedic or neurological conditions (significant limitations in&#xD;
           ambulation or stair climbing) that limit participation in pulmonary rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis Pearson-Product Moment Correlation Coefficient or Spearman Rho for Convergent&#xD;
      Validity will be used to compare 6MWT and TSCT results. Intra-class Correlation Coefficient&#xD;
      for Intra-rater, Inter-rater, and Test-retest Reliability will also be computed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dr. David Lucido was consulted for his expertise as a biostatistician. He suggested that 30&#xD;
      to 60 participants would be an adequate sample size for purposes of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance This study would help to determine if the Timed Stair Climbing Test is a useful&#xD;
      outcome measure for people with pulmonary disease.&#xD;
