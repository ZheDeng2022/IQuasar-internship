  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The process of enhancing the functional capacity of an individual before an operation to&#xD;
      enable him or her to withstand the stress of surgery has been termed prehabilitation. It has&#xD;
      been shown that poor baseline capacity for physical performance and poor nutritional status&#xD;
      increase the risk of complications after major non cardiac surgery and prolong recovery. A&#xD;
      controlled randomized study in patients undergoing radical cystectomy for cancer is therefore&#xD;
      proposed to determine the impact of multimodal prehabilitation on functional exercise&#xD;
      capacity and functional recovery. Patients who accept to be enrolled in the study will be&#xD;
      randomized to either a group receiving a multimodal intervention which includes nutritional&#xD;
      supplementation (Immunocal® whey protein) combined with a physical exercise program and&#xD;
      stress reduction strategies before and after surgery, or a control group who will receive&#xD;
      standard preoperative treatment as per our institution.&#xD;

      Study Arms&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Standard group Patients in this group will follow standard MUHC clinical guidelines.&#xD;
           This group will receive general instructions on exercises (breathing, ankle rotation) to&#xD;
           be done before and after surgery by the preoperative clinic nurse. They will also be&#xD;
           seen by a nutritionist who will provide general counseling for healthy eating.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Prehabilitation group Patients in this group will follow the multimodal protocol&#xD;
           consisting of nutritional supplementation, a specific physical exercise program and&#xD;
           stress reduction strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Patients will be assigned to the two groups using a computer-generated&#xD;
      randomization process whereby brown sealed envelopes will be prepared and opened after&#xD;
      patients' consent has been signed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Components of prehabilitation&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Nutritional supplementation The nutritional status of patients affected by bladder&#xD;
           cancer is directly influenced by the presence of cancer which has an impact on all&#xD;
           aspects of intermediary (protein, carbohydrate, lipid, trace element, vitamin)&#xD;
           metabolism, and by other factors such as age, adjuvant cancer therapy and stage of the&#xD;
           disease. In addition, a patient who is undernourished before surgery has greater risk of&#xD;
           morbidity and mortality. The primary goal of nutrition therapy during the perioperative&#xD;
           period is thus to optimize nutrient stores pre-operatively and provide adequate&#xD;
           nutrition to compensate for the catabolic response of surgery postoperatively. This&#xD;
           includes preventing the loss of lean body mass which is inversely correlated with the&#xD;
           survival of critically ill patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The patients' nutritional status and adequacy of dietary intake will be assessed by a&#xD;
           nutritionist using a three day food record and the Subjective Global Assessment tool.&#xD;
           Percentage of lean body mass and fat will be measured with bioelectrical impedance.&#xD;
           Serum albumin will also be measured. All patients in the prehabilitation group will be&#xD;
           provided with a whey protein supplement (Immunocal®, Immunotec Inc.) and will be&#xD;
           provided with strategies to optimize dietary energy and protein intake. The quantity of&#xD;
           supplement the patient will be required to consume daily will depend on the estimated&#xD;
           deficit in dietary protein intake. This will be determined based on the difference&#xD;
           between usual protein intake and protein requirement, as assessed by the nutritionist at&#xD;
           the baseline assessment. Patients in the control group will receive general instructions&#xD;
           about healthy eating.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Compliance will be monitored weekly through phone calls by the study coordinator. The&#xD;
           patients will also be asked to complete a journal detailing the quantity of nutritional&#xD;
           supplement consumed each day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Physical exercise program It has been shown that prehabilitation can improve&#xD;
           postoperative physical function in cancer patients undergoing colorectal surgery and&#xD;
           lung resection, and these changes are associated with improvements in mental health,&#xD;
           vitality, and self-perceived health. Moreover, it appears that subjects whose fitness&#xD;
           deteriorated preoperatively have more surgical complications and require intensive care.&#xD;
           A recently published systematic review of preoperative physical exercise by Valkenet et&#xD;
           al reported less postoperative complications and shorter length of stay in abdominal&#xD;
           surgery patients. Although the role of exercise intensity is unclear, it appears that&#xD;
           moderate exercise, carried out in a combination of aerobic and resistance training&#xD;
           components, is sufficient to build adequate physiological reserve and energy, even in&#xD;
           patients who receive chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exercise component will consist of approximately 60 min of resistance and aerobic&#xD;
      training, for a minimum of 3 days per week. The exercise program will be individualized based&#xD;
      upon the baseline fitness test (according to the American College of Sport Medicine, ACMS,&#xD;
      standard) and will include: a 5 min warm-up, either 25 min of aerobic exercise (starting at&#xD;
      30- 40 % of heart rate reserve, HRR), and 25 min of resistance training (8 exercises&#xD;
      targeting major muscle groups performed at moderate intensity), and a 5-10 min cool-down and&#xD;
      stretching period. All exercises will be clearly explained and demonstrated by the&#xD;
      kinesiologist at baseline. Patients will be asked to carry out this program at home,&#xD;
      unsupervised, but will be monitored with weekly telephone calls. Training intensity&#xD;
      progression will occur when the participant can complete aerobic exercise on mild exertion&#xD;
      and/or when the participant can complete 15 repetitions of a given resistance exercise.&#xD;
      Participants will be provided with resistance bands and an exercise mat, as well as a&#xD;
      pedometer and a heart rate monitor, which can be used by the participant to monitor progress&#xD;
      and by the kinesiologist to monitor daily compliance. A log book will also be completed to&#xD;
      report all activities and frequency of exercises completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The kinesiologist will follow all the participants on a weekly basis to ensure program&#xD;
      compliance and address any barriers that may prevent ongoing participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will receive general instructions on how to exercise during hospital stay&#xD;
      while in bed, walking and sitting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Anxiety reduction strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that patients undergoing bladder surgery for cancer are anxious and depressed.&#xD;
      The control group will receive general instructions in the preoperative clinic about the&#xD;
      perioperative care and breathing exercises, while those in the prehabilitation group will be&#xD;
      seen by a psychologist coordinator who will provide different strategies to deal with anxiety&#xD;
      and depression (guided imagery, relaxation, visualization, yoga).&#xD;
