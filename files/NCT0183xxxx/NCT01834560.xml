  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the availability of several treatments, a number of patients with major depression&#xD;
      are refractory to therapeutical approaches and therefore suffer from chronic handicap. For&#xD;
      these severe patients, neurosurgical therapies can be envisaged. They aim at interrupting&#xD;
      bundles that link the orbitofrontal cortex with striatum and can therefore benefit for the&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study intends to repeat Dr. Lozano's study, published in 2005 in the journal Neuron. In&#xD;
      this study, they performed a preliminary evaluation of chronic deep brain stimulation (DBS)&#xD;
      of the subgenual cingulate region (Brodmann area 25) to treat refractory depression as an&#xD;
      alternative to subcaudate tractotomy. This last technique was employed in Grenoble in the 60s&#xD;
      with satisfying results before neurosurgery for psychiatric disorders was abandoned. Since&#xD;
      1992, psychosurgical therapies that respect ethical recommendations have regained interest to&#xD;
      treat highly impaired patients. Before the investigators can propose deep brain stimulation&#xD;
      of subgenual cingulate brain region as a new therapeutic approach for the investigators&#xD;
      patients in Grenoble, the investigators decided to reproduce their clinical evaluation on a&#xD;
      group of 6 patients, repeating their methodology faithfully. Therefore nothing was changed to&#xD;
      the model used by Drs. Lozano and Mayberg and the investigators took advantage of the&#xD;
      investigators own expertise regarding deep brain stimulation and subcaudate tractotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol is strictly identical to the one of Mayberg and Lozano in order to confirm their&#xD;
      preliminary results. Cartography of physiological consequences of this procedure will be&#xD;
      assessed by measuring cerebral blood flow by PET scan (positron emission tomography).&#xD;
      Patients will be monitored and thoroughly assessed during including psychiatric,&#xD;
      neurological, neurosurgical, neuropsychological and PET scan exams to measure treatment&#xD;
      efficacy and potential adverse reactions. Patients will be followed for two more years to&#xD;
      assess medium-term complications. This study will be a first step toward further research&#xD;
      including potentially a multicentric clinical trial.&#xD;

      The protocol involves assessment of effects of CG25 (subgenual cingulate area-Brodmann 25)&#xD;
      DBS on mood, anxiety, apathy, anhedonia, psychomotor retardation, functional state as well as&#xD;
      safety and tolerance by specific psychometric scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover the protocol aims at highlighting the neurocircuits modulated by CG25 DBS by means&#xD;
      of PET (positron emission tomography) imagery&#xD;
