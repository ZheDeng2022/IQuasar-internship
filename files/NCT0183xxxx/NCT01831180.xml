  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the differences in various chemical and biologic&#xD;
      parameters of scalp and and hair parameters between young and old Caucasian females. The hair&#xD;
      state and scalp blood flow in younger and older age groups with typical hair care practices&#xD;
      will be qualified by measuring various parameters of the hair shaft and scalp with&#xD;
      correlation back to hair and scalp satisfaction as measured in the subject. This is a single&#xD;
      center study with an anticipated 4 month enrollment period. The investigators will compare&#xD;
      various scalp and hair parameters between young and old Caucasian females by obtaining the&#xD;
      following biological and chemical/structural information. Hair growth rate, anagen to telogen&#xD;
      ratio, hair density (determined via phototrichogram and digital imaging), Vascular blood flow&#xD;
      (Laser Doppler Flowmetry), Histamine stimulation and Hair diameter (clipped hairs). In&#xD;
      addition, a detailed questionnaire will be administered to each subject regarding&#xD;
      satisfaction of the subject's hair state, including typical hair care regimens and symptoms&#xD;
      in scalp and/or hair shafts. This information will be correlated to the biologic and&#xD;
      chemical/structural information about hair and scalp health. Approximately 50 healthy,&#xD;
      Caucasian female subjects will be enrolled in this study. Twenty five participants will be&#xD;
      19-25 years-old and 25 participants 60 years or older. There will be two visits, Baseline and&#xD;
      approximately 48 hours after baseline.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Two areas will be tested in total; one site on the scalp (parietal scalp: which is the area between top of the scalp and either ear) and one area on the forearm. Study staff will take a template and mark off the designated scalp area with a marker. This temporary ink mark will be used as a reference point. The hairs in the marked area (approximately the size of a nickel) will be cut and clipped to 1 millimeter in length for analysis. A digital photographic image of the scalp and hair shafts (phototrichogram) will be taken at the clipped hair site of the scalp. The temporary ink mark that was placed during hair cutting/clipping will be used as a reference point to position the image for capture and storage.</description>

    <description>A site on the forearm will be marked as control on the second visit for laser blood flow measurements. Forearm and scalp blood flow will be assessed with Laser Doppler Imager (LDI) on the marked sites. Scalp reactive hyperemia (scalp blood flow) will be measured by injecting just under the skin a small amount of histamine (100 Âµg of histamine dihydrochloride in 1 ml normal saline) using small needle at both the chosen scalp and forearm sites. Then the blood flow measurement with the LDI will be repeated at the above mentioned sites 1 minute after histamine injection. The study staff will take another digital image (phototrichogram) of the clipped scalp area. The temporary ink mark placed during the baseline visit will serve as a reference point.</description>

    <measure>Hair Chemical Structural information</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Chemical/Structural information Hair diameter (clipped hairs: Hair fiber diameter will be measured on the recovered hair from the initial clipping site. The analysis will be completed at an external laboratory using the OFDA100 instrument.&#xD;
The OFDA100 method allows measurement of the hair diameter from all of the individual hairs in the sample - enabling analysis of the diversity of the population of hairs. This method enables looking at the overall diameter of the population in a single sample, comparing the number of modes, the proportion of each mode, and also the individual diameters and variability of each mode.</description>
