      The purpose of this study is to improve the current standard of care of repairing mouth soft&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will test a tissue equivalent ex vivo produced oral mucosa equivalent(EVPOME),&#xD;
      which is a subject's own cells grown on top of a piece of AlloDerm (a commercially available&#xD;
      freeze dried human cadaver tissue that is routinely used in present day surgical&#xD;
      reconstructive procedures) to create a new piece of soft tissue for use only in that&#xD;
      subject's body. The tissue equivalent product will be tested against a non-experimental&#xD;
      method of grafts, the gold standard a piece of palatal oral mucosa (POM) to see which works&#xD;
      best. Each subject will be randomly assigned to receive either the EVPOME or POM to cover the&#xD;
      defect in their mouth. The objective of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy for&#xD;
      the use of human EVPOME for soft tissue intraoral grafting procedures compared to the &quot;gold&#xD;
      standard&quot; palatal oral mucosa (POM) graft.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Increase in Zone (Width) of Keratinized Mucosa at Grafted Site</measure>
    <time_frame>2 and 4 weeks post surgical graft</time_frame>
    <description>The keratinized mucosa (KM) width will be measured by determining the distance from the crest of the edentulous ridge to the mucogingival line to the nearest millimeter with a Castroviejo caliper. The keratinized mucosa width of study subjects was measured prior to graft placement and then after two weeks, and after 4 weeks. The data provided shows the difference in keratinized mucosa width between the pre surgery measure and the post surgery measure. More mucosa width (positive numbers in mm) is an improvement, negative numbers (a decrease) would be less good.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Graft Contracture</measure>
    <time_frame>2, 4, 8 and 24 weeks after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Graft measurements collected at each time point post graft surgery, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 24 weeks. Measurements collected, Horizontal Coronal (mm), Horizontal Apical (mm), Vertical between coronal and apical (mm), were used to determine the area of the graft as a trapezoid like shape. The area of the graft at each time point was compared to the area of the graft at the time of implantation (graft surgery) to determine the % of graft contracture from implantation thru each follow-up time point. Less graft contracture is considered a better outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Graft Blood Flow</measure>
    <time_frame>2 and 4 weeks after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Graft blood flow measured using Laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) of the graft at 2 and 4 weeks after surgery. LDF measurements (perfusion units) are taken at the site of the graft and compared to LDF readings at a contralateral site on the same subject. The comparison is reported as a percent. The percent is derived by dividing the LDF perfusion units at the graft site by the LDF perfusion units at the contralateral site in the same subject. It is not known how many perfusion units are necessary to adequately supply blood to a graft. By comparing the graft site to the contralateral site in the same patient at 2 and 4 weeks post surgery this data may provide more understanding of graft incorporation.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Immunohistochemistry Using Anti-CD31 (Cluster of Differentiation 31) to Detect Blood Vessel Growth Into the Graft.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks after graft surgery</time_frame>
    <description>A biopsy of the graft is taken at 4 weeks after engraftment. The biopsy is stained for CD31 (cluster of differentiation 31) which is a marker for blood vessels. The number of blood vessels are counted in a standardized size of field. The number of blood vessels within the standardized field is reported. It is not known how much blood vessel development is necessary for graft success, but this study may provide insight into blood vessel development within EVPOME grafts over time.</description>

        <title>Clinical Increase in Zone (Width) of Keratinized Mucosa at Grafted Site</title>
        <description>The keratinized mucosa (KM) width will be measured by determining the distance from the crest of the edentulous ridge to the mucogingival line to the nearest millimeter with a Castroviejo caliper. The keratinized mucosa width of study subjects was measured prior to graft placement and then after two weeks, and after 4 weeks. The data provided shows the difference in keratinized mucosa width between the pre surgery measure and the post surgery measure. More mucosa width (positive numbers in mm) is an improvement, negative numbers (a decrease) would be less good.</description>

        <population>Pregraft data for this outcome was not collected for the first subject, the protocol was written to collect the pregraft measurement after the first subject completed POM graft. For this reason there are only 7 data points in the POM arm of the study.</population>

Measurements collected, Horizontal Coronal (mm), Horizontal Apical (mm), Vertical between coronal and apical (mm), were used to determine the area of the graft as a trapezoid like shape. The area of the graft at each time point was compared to the area of the graft at the time of implantation (graft surgery) to determine the % of graft contracture from implantation thru each follow-up time point. Less graft contracture is considered a better outcome.</description>

        <title>Graft Blood Flow</title>
        <description>Graft blood flow measured using Laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) of the graft at 2 and 4 weeks after surgery. LDF measurements (perfusion units) are taken at the site of the graft and compared to LDF readings at a contralateral site on the same subject. The comparison is reported as a percent. The percent is derived by dividing the LDF perfusion units at the graft site by the LDF perfusion units at the contralateral site in the same subject. It is not known how many perfusion units are necessary to adequately supply blood to a graft. By comparing the graft site to the contralateral site in the same patient at 2 and 4 weeks post surgery this data may provide more understanding of graft incorporation.</description>
