  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will develop and evaluate a treatment plan for prostate focal therapy based on&#xD;
      low dose rate brachytherapy. The participants entering this study are those suitable for&#xD;
      active surveillance. These participants will be monitored with various imaging methods and&#xD;
      interventions such as MR elastography, Transrectal ultrasound elastography, PET/CT and&#xD;
      transperineal mapping biopsy to determine the extent of cancer and suitable treatments. Those&#xD;
      suitable for focal therapy will be offered the option of low dose rate brachytherapy (LDRB)&#xD;
      focal therapy in addition to active surveillance or radical therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be used to evaluate the long term use of multi-modal, multi-parametric&#xD;
      prostate cancer imaging, combining data from MRI, ultrasound and 11C-choline PET/CT. Such&#xD;
      methods can be used to eliminate the need for invasive methods such as mapping biopsies.&#xD;

      1. Purpose&#xD;
&#xD;
           To test the efficacy, acute side effects and long term safety of Focal Therapy in&#xD;
           Prostate Cancer, as compared to conventional radical lose dose radiation prostate&#xD;
           brachytherapy (LDR-PB).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
           We hypothesize that, in an appropriately selected group of early-stage, favourable risk&#xD;
           prostate cancer patients, focal LDR-PB will lead to fewer acute side effects, long term&#xD;
           complications resulting is a better quality of life than radical LDR-PB.&#xD;
&#xD;
           We also hypothesize that multi-modal, multi-parametric imaging will enable monitoring of&#xD;
           the results of focal therapy with an accuracy that is high enough to eventually replace&#xD;
           repeated (and invasive) mapping biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Justification&#xD;
&#xD;
           The imaging study we propose is unique in terms of its multi-modality, multi-parametric&#xD;
           approach. Local disease will be monitored by a very complete set of multi-parametric MR,&#xD;
           ultrasound and PET-CT imaging. Potential spread of the disease may be captured by&#xD;
           abdominal and whole-body PET-CT. Comparison with biopsies will be more accurate than in&#xD;
           other studies because biopsy location will be accurately provided by the trans-perineal&#xD;
           three-dimensional template-guided pathological mapping biopsy (TTMB), in contrast to&#xD;
           Post-radical prostatectomy (RP) studies that use axial whole mount slices which suffer&#xD;
           from a significant change in prostate physical shape and unpredictable deformation due&#xD;
           to fixation, making an accurate registration of pathology and imaging difficult.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The impact of our study on the field of medical imaging will also be significant.&#xD;
           Advances in the topics of deformable multi-modal registration, dosimetry, and the&#xD;
           characterization of cancer as image features in MR, ultrasound and PET-CT are expected.&#xD;
           These findings will be widely disseminated in papers addressing both clinical and&#xD;
           technical publications.&#xD;
&#xD;
           We are not aware of any study in which TTMB-guided focal brachytherapy has been&#xD;
           implemented and tested. A center of our size, with our record in outcomes, and with a&#xD;
           complete set of imaging expertise and tools to help with patient selection and&#xD;
           monitoring, may make a very significant impact in how focal therapy can be implemented&#xD;
           and evaluated. Therefore, we have the potential to provide valuable input on how to&#xD;
           translate focal therapy into standard care for appropriately selected patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
           The specific objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. To develop provisional criteria for what constitutes focal disease and treatment&#xD;
                plans appropriate for focal LDR-PB.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. To show that patients undergoing focal therapy have a better quality of life than&#xD;
                those undergoing radical therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. To correlate multi-modal, multi-parametric imaging results with the results of&#xD;
                mapping biopsies with the goal of developing image-based techniques for patient&#xD;
                selection and monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Research Method&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants in the study will undergo multi-modal, multi-parametric imaging as outlined&#xD;
           in the study protocol (MRI, Ultrasound imaging, and PET/CT). Participants that are&#xD;
           eligible to continue in the study and receive focal therapy will undergo 3D-&#xD;
           Template-Guided Trans-Perineal Pathological Mapping Biopsy (TTMB). Participants will&#xD;
           also be asked to complete study surveys and have repeat pathological mapping done at 2&#xD;
           year post treatment..&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our recruiting plan, we have assumed that approximately 50% of the participants who are&#xD;
      initially eligible will continue to focal therapy. The planned sample size for this pilot&#xD;
      study is 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging hypotheses: The hypothesis that focal treatment will change the imaged treated area&#xD;
      tissue properties but will leave unchanged properties of tissue in the untreated area will be&#xD;
      tested using paired data on each participant.&#xD;
