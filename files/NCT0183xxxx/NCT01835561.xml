  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for research purposes only and will not treat any disease or condition you may&#xD;
      have. The study is an open label and single dose study; open label means that you, the study&#xD;
      doctor and study staff will know which study drug you are taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research study is to compare drug levels in the body of people with liver&#xD;
      disease to drug levels in healthy people with a normal liver. In addition, the safety of the&#xD;
      study drug will be studied. Information about any side effects (discomfort or decline in&#xD;
      health) that may happen will be collected. The study drug will be given by mouth to subjects&#xD;
      with liver disease and to healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the body, drugs are normally removed by the liver with a smaller amount being removed by&#xD;
      the kidneys. When the liver is not working as well as it should, the body may not be able to&#xD;
      remove drugs from the body quickly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information from this study will be used to decide if the drug is safe in subjects with&#xD;
      liver disease or if a lower dose of the study drug would be safer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted at more than one clinical site (2-3 clinical research sites) and&#xD;
      designed to assess the impact of severe liver disease or hepatic impairment (Part 1, Group 1)&#xD;
      on the PK of pomalidomide following oral administration of a single dose of 4 mg pomalidomide&#xD;
      (the study drug). The study drug, pomalidomide (POMALYST®), has been approved by the United&#xD;
      States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat patients with multiple myeloma (MM).&#xD;
      Patients with MM have bone marrow that produces a large number of abnormal cells.&#xD;
      Pomalidomide is only available by prescription.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since participants in this study do not have MM, pomalidomide is considered experimental for&#xD;
      the purposes of this research study. Throughout this form, pomalidomide will be referred to&#xD;
      as &quot;the study drug.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study will be in either the healthy group or the group with liver&#xD;
      disease. For the group with the liver disease,the liver disease will be graded by the study&#xD;
      doctor as being &quot;severe,&quot; &quot;moderate,&quot; or &quot;mild.&quot; This will be done by the study doctor&#xD;
      depending on medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and certain previous&#xD;
      results of liver scans or liver biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The amount of the study drug in blood will be measured at certain times to how well the drug&#xD;
      is broken-down or removed from the body. Blood samples approximately 1 teaspoon&#xD;
      (approximately 5-6 mL) will be collected 13 times the following times to measure study drug&#xD;
      levels in your blood:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Predose (just before dosing), and at 0.25, 1, 2, 2.5, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 30, and 48 hours&#xD;
      after dose pomalidomide morning dose on Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will have two parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 will evaluate the study drug in subjects with severe liver disease (Group and healthy&#xD;
      volunteer subjects (Group 1) matched to the subjects with liver disease. Part 2 will evaluate&#xD;
      the study drug in subjects with moderate (Group 3) and/ mild (Group 4) liver disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participation will be in one part only (either Part 1 or Part 2). Part be conducted&#xD;
      after the data from Part 1 is analyzed and reviewed and the doctor and the sponsor determine&#xD;
      that there is a need to conduct Part 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purposes of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure and compare the levels of pomalidomide in the blood of male subjects with&#xD;
           severe liver disease and their matched healthy volunteer subjects after taking one 4-mg&#xD;
           capsule of pomalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure and compare the levels of pomalidomide in the blood of male subjects with&#xD;
           moderate or mild liver disease after taking one 4-mg capsule of pomalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the impact of liver disease on the safety of a single dose of pomalidomide in&#xD;
           male subjects with liver disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 16 male subjects will be enrolled in Part 1 of the study (8 healthy subjects&#xD;
      and 8 subjects with severe liver disease). Approximately 16 male subjects will be in Part 2&#xD;
      of the study (8 subjects with mild liver disease and subjects with moderate liver disease).&#xD;
      If both parts of the study are completed, a total of about 32 male subjects will be enrolled.&#xD;
      The total time a participant will be in the study is about 1 month (from screening visit to&#xD;
      end of study).&#xD;
