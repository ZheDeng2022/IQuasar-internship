    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies the impact of radiation therapy on the immunogenicity of&#xD;
      Sipuleucel-T. Patients with castration recurrent prostate cancer who are eligible for&#xD;
      treatment with Sipuleucel-T and who have bone metastases are eligible.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess whether radiation therapy (RT) increases the immunogenic potential or&#xD;
      sipuleucel-T in participants with castration recurrent prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess systemic changes to the immune system and genetic changes to immune cells in&#xD;
      participants treated by the combination of RT and sipuleucel-T.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess the induction of antigen-specific immune responses to prostatic acid&#xD;
      phosphatase (PAP), cancer/testis antigen 1B (NY-ESO-1) and antigens that have proven to be&#xD;
      released by radiation (such as, heat shock protein 90 [HSP-90], calreticulin, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess adverse event rates in participants receiving the high-dose radiation and&#xD;
      sipuleucel-T therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess prostate-specific antigen (PSA) changes. III. To assess overall and cancer&#xD;
      specific survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo single-fraction radiation therapy to at least 1 bone lesion 2 days after the&#xD;
      first sipuleucel-T dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 and 6 months and then&#xD;
      annually thereafter.&#xD;
