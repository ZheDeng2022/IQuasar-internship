  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nausea in early pregnancy (emesis gravidarum) is very common but most often self-limiting.&#xD;
      Hyperemesis gravidarum; where nausea and vomiting is severe and protracted is potentially&#xD;
      dangerous for the woman and her foetus and necessitates hospital treatment. An English&#xD;
      questionnaire (PUQE; Pregnancy Unique Questionnaire of Emesis) exists that can differentiate&#xD;
      between uncomplicated emesis and the severe hyperemesis condition. This questionnaire has&#xD;
      been translated to Norwegian. The investigators want to test the ability of this&#xD;
      questionnaire to differentiate the grade of nausea/vomiting between a group of presumed&#xD;
      normal pregnant woman and patients treated for hyperemesis gravidarum in a Norwegian&#xD;
      population. The investigators also want to relate the PUQE questionnaire scoring to the&#xD;
      women/patients' self-reported nutritional intake during 24 hours.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      This is a prospective case-control study validating Pregnancy Unique Questionnaire of Emesis&#xD;
      (PUQE) in a Norwegian population. The questionnaire has been translated from English to&#xD;
      Norwegian by authorized translators. The Norwegian questionnaire's title is Svangerskaps&#xD;
      Utl√∏st Kvalme Kvantifisering (SUKK). The Norwegian version has been independently&#xD;
      back-translated to English. The back-translated version has been approved by the original&#xD;
      author Gideon Koren.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate if the questionnaire score is significantly different&#xD;
      between a group of presumed healthy pregnant woman and a group of patients hospitalized with&#xD;
      hyperemesis gravidarum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The women will also fill in a self-reported 24-hours nutritional intake diary and this will&#xD;
      be related to the Pregnancy Unique Questionnaire of Emesis (PUQE)score. For patients&#xD;
      hospitalized with hyperemesis gravidarum the Pregnancy Unique Questionnaire of Emesis&#xD;
      (PUQE)score both at admission and discharge will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background clinical information for both groups at enrollment will be recorded as well as&#xD;
      pregnancy outcome for woman and child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has been approved by the Institutional Board as well as the Norwegian Regional&#xD;
      Ethical Committee (REK Norway). Women will be included after giving informed written consent.&#xD;
      Data will be stored electronically, anonymised, at a designated research server in accordance&#xD;
      with the institutional research rules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size have been determined on basis of a similar study evaluating different&#xD;
      nutritional status in emesis and hyperemesis patients, using 20 patients in each group. We&#xD;
      aim to include 30 patients in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with diagnose of Hyperemesis gravidarum admitted form 1st of May 2013 will be&#xD;
      consecutively asked to participate. Control patients will be recruited by invitation at&#xD;
      primary care facilities or private out-patient gynaecologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses will be performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences&#xD;
      (SPSS). Categorical variables will be compared using Chi-square test and continuous variables&#xD;
      by non-parametric tests. Paired test will be used when comparing Pregnancy Unique&#xD;
      Questionnaire of Emesis (PUQE)scores sequentially from admittance to discharge.&#xD;
