  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      No investigational drug will be administered in this study for the treatment of Fabry&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a multicenter, multinational, non-treatment, cross-sectional study of young male&#xD;
      patients with Fabry disease who have not yet initiated interventional treatment for this&#xD;
      disease. The study will consist of a screening visit(s), a clinical investigation visit(s),&#xD;
      and a follow-up phone contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To document renal function and other Fabry disease manifestations across age in&#xD;
           treatment-naïve, young male patients with Fabry disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To provide a reference group for comparison with interventional clinical trials of Fabry&#xD;
           disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of each patient's participation in the study, inclusive of the screening visit&#xD;
      and follow-up phone contact, will be approximately 12 weeks.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who meet all eligibility criteria based on screening assessments will be scheduled&#xD;
      to return to the clinic for assessments of renal function and other disease-related&#xD;
      parameters, which may be scheduled over one or more clinical investigation visits. The&#xD;
      clinical investigation visit(s) will be scheduled such that renal and cardiac assessments&#xD;
      occur after the required medication washout (see exclusion criterion); other procedures may&#xD;
      be performed either before or after the medication washout, at the discretion of the&#xD;
      investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 100 patients will be enrolled in the study, including a minimum of 15 patients in each&#xD;
      of the following age groups (based on age at screening): 5 to 11 years, 12 to 17 years, and&#xD;
      18 to 25 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be encouraged to enroll in the Fabry Registry (NCT00196742) for continued&#xD;
      follow-up after completion of the study.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient and/or their parent/legal guardian is willing and able to provide signed&#xD;
             informed consent. If the patient is below the age of consent per local guidelines, he&#xD;
             is willing to provide assent, if deemed able to do so.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient must have a confirmed diagnosis of Fabry disease as documented by&#xD;
             leukocyte α-galactosidase A (αGAL) of &lt;4 nmol/hr/mg leukocyte (preferred assay;&#xD;
             results from a central laboratory). If the leukocyte αGAL activity assay is difficult&#xD;
             to obtain, the patient may be enrolled based on documented plasma αGAL &lt;1.5 nmol/hr/mL&#xD;
             (results from a central laboratory), with the agreement of the Genzyme Medical&#xD;
             Monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has received prior treatment with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) or oral&#xD;
             pharmacological chaperone therapy for Fabry disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has received an investigational drug within 30 days of the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is receiving any of the following medications and is clinically unable or&#xD;
             unwilling to temporarily discontinue treatment with these medications for the&#xD;
             indicated washout period prior to the renal function assessments until completion of&#xD;
             these assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (6 week&#xD;
                  washout);&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (3 day washout).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  NOTE: Patients who are on chronic dialysis or have had a kidney transplant will&#xD;
                  not be required to discontinue the above medications because renal function&#xD;
                  assessments will not be performed in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has any contraindication mentioned in the labeling of iohexol. NOTE: patients&#xD;
             with an eGFR &lt;30 mL/min/1.73m^2 and patients who are on chronic dialysis or have had a&#xD;
             kidney transplant may be enrolled irrespective of any contraindication to iohexol&#xD;
             because iGFR will not be measured in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has any medical condition or extenuating circumstance which, in the opinion of&#xD;
             the Investigator, could interfere with the patient's ability to complete all study&#xD;
             procedures, or with the interpretation of study results (e.g., diabetes mellitus).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient and/or their parent or legal guardian, in the opinion of the Investigator,&#xD;
             is unable to adhere to the requirements of the study.&#xD;
