      The study hypotheses is that the proportion of patients experiencing clinically significant&#xD;
      pain relief will be at least 30% greater than the proportion experiencing worsening pain.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As part of the PMA # P110039 review process and approval, InSightec was requested to conduct&#xD;
      a post-approval study. Patients will be treated following the approved commercial treatment&#xD;
      guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, participating sites will use the ExAblate device for the administration of&#xD;
      the ExAblate treatment. This study will be performed on either 1.5T or 3T MR scanners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, a total of 70 patients meeting the approved commercial guidelines will be&#xD;
      enrolled and treated with the ExAblate system at from 7 to 10 sites. The proportion of&#xD;
      responders is expected to be at least 30% greater than the proportion of subjects&#xD;
      experiencing pain progression (i.e., 60% vs. 30%). Additionally, at the 3 month visit, an&#xD;
      analysis of both the safety and efficacy profiles will be compared to the original PMA&#xD;
      pivotal study group.&#xD;

    <description>The statistical hypothesis is that the proportion of responders will be significantly greater than the proportion of subjects experiencing pain progression (worsened pain or increased pain medications usage) by at least 30% or an odds ratio of at least 2.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety Profile</measure>
    <time_frame>Three Months</time_frame>
    <description>A full safety profile will be developed for the ExAblate treatment of bone metastases. All adverse events will be captured and summarized as defined in Section-6.2. Adverse events (type, frequency, severity) are expected to be similar to those captured for the original PMA study (PMA # P110039). For his study, the Safety comparison will be descriptive with no statistical endpoints.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Interference</measure>
    <time_frame>Three Months</time_frame>
    <description>Patient overall quality of life status will be assessed by the BPI-QoL Pain Interference scale which will be administered pre-treatment and post-treatment. The trajectory of change may be analyzed descriptively by regression slopes.</description>
