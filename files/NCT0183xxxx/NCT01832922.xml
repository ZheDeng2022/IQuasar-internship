  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, open label, dose-ranging study of Bendamustine and Rituximab (BR)&#xD;
      in patients with previously untreated or relapsed/refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia&#xD;
      (CLL) who have multiple comorbidities with or without renal insufficiency. These agents are&#xD;
      FDA approved for this indication. However, full dose bendamustine is associated with&#xD;
      significant hematologic toxicity and a high rate of infectious complications in &quot;unfit&quot;&#xD;
      patients and patients with significantly impaired renal function. This study will attempt to&#xD;
      optimize and define adequate and safe treatment protocols for these patients with&#xD;
      comorbidities and/or renal dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will accrue two independent patient cohorts which will follow a standard Phase I&#xD;
      design. Patients with CLL who have significant comorbidities with or without minor renal&#xD;
      dysfunction (CrCL&gt;40 mL/min) will be accrued onto Cohort 1 of the study. Patients with&#xD;
      significant renal dysfunction (CrCL&lt;40 mL/min) will be accrued onto Cohort 2. Once the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined, two expansion cohorts will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a treatment period of up to six 28-day cycles. On C1D1 all qualifying patients&#xD;
      will provide samples for biomarker analysis. Six patients without renal dysfunction and 6 to&#xD;
      9 patients with renal dysfunction will also provide samples for bendamustine PK analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accrual of both patient cohorts will occur simultaneously and will take place at two centers:&#xD;
      Norris Cotton Cancer Center (NCCC) and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI). Coordination of&#xD;
      accrual to the study cohorts will be centralized at NCCC by Dr. Alexey V. Danilov.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized open label dose-ranging study of Bendamustine and Rituximab (BR) in&#xD;
      patients with previously untreated or relapsed/refractory CLL who have multiple comorbidities&#xD;
      (Cumulative Illness Rating Scale [CIRS]≥7) with or without renal insufficiency (estimated&#xD;
      creatinine clearance [CrCL] 15-40 mL/min, but not receiving dialysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will accrue two independent patient cohorts. Both cohorts will follow a standard&#xD;
      3+3 Phase I design. Once the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined, two expansion&#xD;
      cohorts will be enrolled. Dose limiting toxicities (DLT) will be assessed during the 1st&#xD;
      cycle of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with CLL who have significant comorbidities (CIRS≥7; at least one category grade&#xD;
      3-4), with or without minor renal dysfunction (CrCL&gt;40 mL/min) will be accrued onto Cohort 1&#xD;
      of the study. At dose level 1, patients will receive bendamustine 45 mg/m2 in combination&#xD;
      with rituximab (375 mg/m2 with cycle 1 and 500 mg/m2 with subsequent cycles). If safe, the&#xD;
      dose of bendamustine will be escalated to 70 mg/m2 (dose level 2). By contrast, dose&#xD;
      de-escalation to 25 mg/m2 (dose level -1) will occur in this cohort if DLT's are encountered&#xD;
      at dose level 1. Once an MTD is determined an expansion cohort will be accrued at that dose&#xD;
      level to allow assessment of DLT's during subsequent cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because bendamustine has not been formally studied in patients with renal failure and due to&#xD;
      the potential for increased frequency of toxic events in such patients, patients with&#xD;
      significant renal dysfunction (CrCL 15-40 mL/min, but not receiving dialysis) will be accrued&#xD;
      on Cohort 2. DLT's in 0/3 (or ≤1/6) subjects with renal dysfunction at dose level 1 (as&#xD;
      above) will permit continued accrual of such subjects onto the expansion cohort (N=10). If&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity is encountered, bendamustine dose will be reduced to 25 mg/m2 (dose&#xD;
      level -1), followed by an expansion cohort if safe (10 patients). Dose escalation will not be&#xD;
      allowed in this cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accrual of both patient cohorts will occur simultaneously (see Schema) and will take place at&#xD;
      two centers: the ambulatory Hematology Clinics at the Norris Cotton Cancer Center (NCCC) at&#xD;
      Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center (DHMC), Lebanon, NH (Lead [Dartmouth] Principal&#xD;
      Investigator [Lead PI] - Alexey Danilov M.D., Ph.D.), and the CLL Center at Dana-Farber&#xD;
      Cancer Institute (DFCI), Boston, MA (DFCI Principal Investigator [DFCI PI] - Jennifer Brown&#xD;
      M.D., Ph.D.). Coordination of accrual to the study cohorts will be centralized at the Norris&#xD;
      Cotton Cancer Center/DHMC by Dr. Alexey V. Danilov.&#xD;
