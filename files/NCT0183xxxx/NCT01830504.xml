  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In France, 7-8 000 new thyroid cancer cases are diagnosed each year. Although a good overall&#xD;
      prognosis, it is usually estimated that 10 to 20% will rescue and 5% will become metastatic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard treatment of advanced metastatic or recurrent thyroid cancer is limited to&#xD;
      radioiodine therapy. It is estimated that 30 to 50% of patients will become resistant to&#xD;
      radio iodine. Treatments options are limited in these refractory thyroid patients and long&#xD;
      term survival is estimated to less than 10%. Nowadays, no drug is approved in this&#xD;
      indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recent explosion in knowledge in tumour biology and the identification of potential&#xD;
      biological targets in thyroid cancer led to several clinical trials with targeted therapies,&#xD;
      mainly focused on TKI inhibitors targeting the MAPkinase pathway and/or VEGF. Preliminary&#xD;
      results were encouraging in papillary thyroid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follicular (FTC) and poorly differentiated thyroid (PDTC) cancers account for 10% of thyroid&#xD;
      cancer but 20-25% of cancers diagnosed at an advanced stage and near 50% of metastatic&#xD;
      refractory thyroid cancers. These cancers with an aggressive behavior represent a major cause&#xD;
      of death from thyroid cancer. In these subtypes, targeted therapies gave disappointing&#xD;
      results. This may be related to the mutational profile of these tumors which is different&#xD;
      from that of papillary cancers. Aberrant activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase&#xD;
      (PI3K)/AKT pathway is thought to play a fundamental role in thyroid tumorigenenesis of&#xD;
      follicular and poorly differentiated thyroid cancers. Many genetic alterations have been,&#xD;
      recently, identified in this pathway. PIK3CA mutations are found in 10-15% of FTC and can&#xD;
      also occur in metastases derived from PDTC. Amplification/genomic copy gain of the PIK3CA has&#xD;
      been identified in 24% of FTC and 42% of PDTC. Epigenetic inactivation of PTEN which&#xD;
      negatively regulates PI3K has been shown in FTC. Moreover, RAS mutations observed in 20-40%&#xD;
      of FTC and PDTC can activate the PI3K/AKT by interacting with the RAS-binding site of the&#xD;
      P110 catalytic subunit of PI3K.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the high frequency of activation of PI3K and downstream effectors in progressive,&#xD;
      recurrent and poorly differentiated cancers, inhibition of the PI3K signaling pathway with&#xD;
      BKM120, a potent pan class I PI3K inhibitor, represents a particularly relevant therapeutic&#xD;
      target and should be properly evaluated in advanced follicular and poorly differentiated&#xD;
      thyroid carcinomas&#xD;

      The primary objective of the study will be to determine efficacy of BKM120 as measured by the&#xD;
      progression free survival (PFS rate) at 6 months in patients with progressive, metastatic,&#xD;
      refractory, follicular or poorly differentiated thyroid cancers.&#xD;
