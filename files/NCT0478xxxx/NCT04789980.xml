  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study objectives are to find out: 1) palliative chemotherapy patterns and prognosis in&#xD;
      patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer in Korea's real clinical&#xD;
      settings, and 2) reasons adopted by clinicians in choosing therapeutic drugs.&#xD;

      This study is a domestic, multi-center, prospective, observational study designed for locally&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer patients who plan to receive palliative&#xD;
      chemotherapy. When patients voluntarily express their consent to provide their information to&#xD;
      this study by signing a written agreement, their baseline information including demographics,&#xD;
      comorbidities, pancreatic cancer-related information, medical treatment history, etc. shall&#xD;
      be used for screening. When patients are judged eligible for study participation, they shall&#xD;
      receive an appropriate palliative chemotherapy. After first-line chemotherapy (baseline),&#xD;
      information review shall be conducted at month 2, 6 and 12 for chemotherapy currently in use&#xD;
      (whether or not chemotherapy ended/discontinued and relevant reasons; type, frequency and&#xD;
      duration of administered drugs), RECIST, quality of life (month 2 and 6), activity&#xD;
      performance assessment, laboratory tests, tumor marker test, adverse drug reactions, etc.&#xD;
      However, if first-line chemotherapy moves to second-line chemotherapy due to causes such as&#xD;
      progressive disease (PD), information review shall be restricted to the relevant drug name&#xD;
      and survival until the end of the study (month 12).&#xD;
