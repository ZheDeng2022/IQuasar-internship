  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this clinical trial is to develop a cell therapy for Fanconi Anemia which&#xD;
      enables enhanced donor hematopoietic and immune reconstitution with decreased toxicity by&#xD;
      transplanting depleted stem cells from a donor after using an experimental treatment called&#xD;
      JSP-191 as a part of conditioning. This experimental treatment will hopefully cause fewer&#xD;
      side effects than chemotherapy (the current standard of care method).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be administered the conditioning regimen, are assessed until they receive&#xD;
      the depleted stem cell infusion, and will be followed for up to 2 years after the cell&#xD;
      infusion.&#xD;
