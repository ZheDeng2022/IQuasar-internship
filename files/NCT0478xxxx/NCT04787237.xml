      immediate implant placement using the VST was compared to early implant placement protocol&#xD;
      using Buser's technique regarding implant survival, changes in labial plate thickness and&#xD;
      soft tissue height after 1 year of implant placement&#xD;

      Preoperative procedures A preoperative radiograph was performed for all patients for&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment planning purposes. Non-surgical periodontal treatment was done as&#xD;
      needed. Impressions were taken and casted in stone for the fabrication of the surgical&#xD;
      templates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical protocol As dictated by the randomization patients were assigned to either Buser's&#xD;
      technique or to the VST. In the VST group, atraumatic tooth extraction was carried out using&#xD;
      periotomes (Stoma, Storz am Mark GmbH, Emmingen-Liptingen Germany) under local anaesthesia&#xD;
      (ARTINIBSA 4% 1:100.000. Inibsa Dental S.L.U. Barcelona, SPAIN). After that, the socket was&#xD;
      thoroughly curetted and debrided and repeatedly irrigated with 100 ml of anti-anaerobic&#xD;
      infusion solution of 500 mg Metronidazole (Minapharm pharmaceuticals, Egypt). The root was&#xD;
      then trimmed to half-length, its surface cleansed with an ultrasonic cleaner and reinserted&#xD;
      into the socket with its crown bonded to adjacent teeth . After six days, the root was&#xD;
      removed and VST protocol was implemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vestibular socket therapy (VST) included the following steps. a-traumatic tooth extraction,&#xD;
      the socket curetted and rinsed with normal saline thoroughly. One-cm long vestibular access&#xD;
      incision was made using a 15c blade (Stoma, Storz am Mark GmbH, Emmingen-Liptingen Germany)&#xD;
      3-4 mm apical to the mucogingival junction at the related socket . A subperiosteal tunnel was&#xD;
      created connecting the socket orifice and the vestibular access incision using periotomes and&#xD;
      micro periosteal elevators (Stoma, Storz am Mark GmbH, Emmingen-Liptingen Germany). Implant&#xD;
      fixture (Biohorizons, Birmingham, Al, USA) were then inserted after drilling to its&#xD;
      pre-planned location 3-4 mm apical to socket base with adequate primary stability achieved&#xD;
      using a torque wrench reaching 30 Ncm torque . A flexible cortical membrane shield that is&#xD;
      made of cortical bone of heterologous origin of 0.6 mm thickness (OsteoBiol® Lamina ,&#xD;
      Tecnoss®, Torino, Italy) was hydrated and then trimmed and introduced from the vestibular&#xD;
      access incision reaching 1 mm below the socket orifice through the tunnel then stabilized&#xD;
      using a membrane tack or a micro screw to the alveolar bone apical to the base of the socket&#xD;
      (AutoTac System Kit, Biohorizons Implant Systems, Birmingham , Alabama Inc, USA) . The socket&#xD;
      gap between the implant and the shield was then packed thoroughly with particulate bone graft&#xD;
      (75% autogenous bone chips and 25% deproteinized bovine bone mineral (DBBM) of equine origin,&#xD;
      fully enzyme deantigenised (Bio-Gen Mix, Bioteck, Vicenza -Italy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Buser's group early implant placement, the failing tooth was extracted atraumatically&#xD;
      using a periotome. A collagen plug was placed to stabilize the wound clot. A healing period&#xD;
      of 8-12 weeks (depending on the size of the extracted tooth) was followed. Then an open flap&#xD;
      implant surgery using a triangular flap design was cut. A slightly palatal incision in the&#xD;
      edentulous area is done, with the incision made along the inner surface of the palatal bone&#xD;
      wall deep into the socket allowing the entire regenerated soft tissue to be part of the&#xD;
      buccal flap. After preparing the implant bed, the site was irrigated using normal saline.&#xD;
      Implant was then placed under the crest of the palatal bone. A healing abutment was then&#xD;
      attached. Contour augmentation was done using autogenous bone chips mixed with saline and&#xD;
      bone conditioned medium (BCM) added to bioss bone granules to activate it. The bone graft was&#xD;
      placed in a layered manner, where the cortical bone chips were placed first followed by the&#xD;
      bio-oss activated mix. A non-cross liked membrane was then placed, after being soaked with&#xD;
      BCM. Finally, the healing abutment was removed and the flap was released to allow for its&#xD;
      suturing.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>implant survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Implant insertion- 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Implant survival was reported as defined by Buser et al by the absence of peri-implant infection, persistent subjective complaints such as pain, foreign body sensation, and/or dysesthesia, radiolucency around the implant, and/or any detectable implant mobility.</description>

    <measure>mucosal recession</measure>
    <time_frame>crown delivery and 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Amount of mucosal recession was identified midfacially and at the apex of the mesial and distal papillae by superimposing the STL files of the models, obtained via intra-oral scanning, at the baseline (of the unrestorable tooth) with those after 12 months of implant insertion. The 3D software roughly aligned of both pre-and postoperative models through 3 identical points, identified on their surfaces. The best-fit algorithm of the software then perfected the superimposition process. The superimposed models were then imported into an STL viewer, where the measurements were performed. This method was proven to be accurate in volumetric measurements of hard and soft tissues.</description>
