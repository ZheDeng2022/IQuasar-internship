    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open, phase II clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      high-dose almonertinib in the treatment of rare mutations in locally advanced or metastatic&#xD;
      NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations (excluding exon 19 deletion or rare mutations outside&#xD;
      L858R). Patients showed EGFR mutations by tissue or blood tests (excluding exon 19 deletion&#xD;
      or rare mutations other than L858R), of which 20 exon (20INS) mutations and rare mutations&#xD;
      other than 20Ins were classified as two covariates. High-dose amitinib was used for treatment&#xD;
      to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the treatment regimen.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  1. 18 ≤ age ≤75, regardless of gender. 2. Histologically confirmed locally advanced or&#xD;
             metastatic non-scaly NSCLC (including stage IIIB-IV patients who relapsed after&#xD;
             previous surgical treatment or were newly diagnosed). According to AJCC edition 8 lung&#xD;
             cancer staging criteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Previous treatment with second-line chemotherapy (no EGFR-TKI) is allowed. 4.&#xD;
             Positive EGFR driver mutation (rare mutation other than 19 exon deletion or L858R)&#xD;
             detected by tumor tissue or blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. The Eastern Tumor Tissue Cooperative Group (ECOG) physical status score was 0 or 1&#xD;
             and did not deteriorate in the previous 2 weeks, with a minimum expected survival of&#xD;
             12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. The patient had at least one tumor lesion that had not received previous local&#xD;
             treatment such as irradiation, nor had he received biopsy during the screening period,&#xD;
             and it could be accurately measured at baseline, with the longest diameter ≥ 10mm at&#xD;
             baseline (short diameter ≥ 15mm for lymph nodes). The measurement method chosen is&#xD;
             suitable for accurate repeated measurements and can be computed tomography (CT) or&#xD;
             magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). If there is only one measurable lesion and no&#xD;
             previous local treatment such as irradiation, it may be accepted as the target lesion,&#xD;
             and a baseline evaluation of the tumor lesion shall be conducted at least 14 days&#xD;
             after the diagnostic biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. For fertile women, appropriate contraception should be used and breastfeeding&#xD;
             should not be performed for 3 months from screening to discontinuation of study&#xD;
             treatment. A pregnancy test is negative before administration, or there is no proven&#xD;

        or bilateral salpingectomy, except for bilateral tubal ligation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Male patients should use barrier contraception (i.e., condoms) from screening until 3&#xD;
        months after treatment is discontinued.&#xD;
