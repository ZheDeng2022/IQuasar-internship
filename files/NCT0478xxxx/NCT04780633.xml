  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was conducted to investigate the effect of a training program based on the&#xD;
      PRECEDE-PROCEED Model on improving genital hygiene behaviors.It was carried out using&#xD;
      experimental research design with pre-test and post-test, randomized and a control group. The&#xD;
      study was conducted at Erzurum Saltuklu Family Health Center between June 2017 and January&#xD;
      2018. Of the women with genital infections, 120 women were included in the study, of which 60&#xD;
      were in the experimental group and 60 were in the control group. The data were collected by&#xD;
      &quot;Personal Information Form,&quot; &quot;Genital Hygiene Knowledge, Attitude and Beliefs, Questionnaire&quot;&#xD;
      and &quot;Genital Hygiene Behavior Inventory&quot;. In study, genital hygiene training intervention&#xD;
      prepared according to the Precede-Proceed model was applied to the women in the experimental&#xD;
      group. The women in the experimental group were measured at three different times: pre-test&#xD;
      before training, post-test through training completition, and follow-up test after 4 weeks.&#xD;
      The women in the control group did not receive any training intervention, the pre-test at the&#xD;
      first encounter in the family health center and the post-test 5 weeks later.&#xD;

    <description>A Training Program for Genital Hygiene Behaviors prepared in line with the Precede-Proceed model was presented to the women in the experimental group. The trainings started one week after the pre-test data were collected and were conducted in a total of 5 sessions, each lasting an average of 40 minutes, once a week. At the end of the five-week training, a post-test was applied. In order to determine the behavior changes of the women in the experimental group, a follow-up test was applied 4 weeks after the training ended. At the end of the training, women were given a training booklet prepared by the researcher.</description>
