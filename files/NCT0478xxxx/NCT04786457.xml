      The purpose of this research study is to test the protection of volunteers previously&#xD;
      vaccinated with Tetravalent Dengue Virus (TDEN) Purified Inactivated Vaccine (PIV) with alum&#xD;
      and boosted with TDEN live attenuated vaccine (LAV) formulation against a weakened form of an&#xD;
      experimental dengue virus challenge. The Investigators will also include people that have not&#xD;
      received the study vaccine. The Investigators are collecting information about how the&#xD;
      vaccine protects against a dengue virus challenge as well as adding to knowledge about the&#xD;
      safety of the challenge.&#xD;

      The purpose of this research study is to test the protection of volunteers previously&#xD;
      vaccinated with Tetravalent Dengue Virus (TDEN) Purified Inactivated Vaccine (PIV) with alum&#xD;
      and boosted with TDEN live attenuated vaccine (LAV) formulation against a weakened form of an&#xD;
      experimental dengue virus challenge. The Investigators will also include people that have not&#xD;
      received the study vaccine. The Investigators are collecting information about how the&#xD;
      vaccine protects against a dengue virus challenge as well as adding to knowledge about the&#xD;
      safety of the challenge. The information will help Investigators develop vaccines to protect&#xD;
      people from dengue. Participation is voluntary. The duration of participation will last for&#xD;
      180 days (six months). After participants are exposed to the weakened dengue virus, the&#xD;
      Investigators will follow them closely to measure their symptoms. Like the flu, participants&#xD;
      might expect to have a headache, rash, body aches, fever and chills or they may experience no&#xD;
      symptoms whatsoever. If a participant does develops symptoms, the Investigators will monitor&#xD;
      him/her closely in a local hotel or a wing of our hospital to ensure safety and to treat&#xD;
      symptoms if they occur. Participants will be compensated for their time.&#xD;
