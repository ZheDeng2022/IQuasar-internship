  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to describe the prevalence of additional autoimmune diseases and their&#xD;
      specific antibodies at type 1 diabetes (T1D) diagnosis, and their incidence rate during&#xD;
      follow-up, for children and adolescents. It also aims to describe the characteristics of the&#xD;
      pediatric cohort followed since 2014 for type 1 diabetes by one of France's centers of&#xD;
      reference for paediatric diabetes.&#xD;
