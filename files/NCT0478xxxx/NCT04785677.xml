  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are conducting a randomized controlled trial to assess the impact of&#xD;
      Resiliency in Stressful Experiences (RISE) - a comprehensive trauma-based program for young&#xD;
      men releasing from a southeastern state's prisons. The investigators are assessing whether&#xD;
      treating trauma and providing other transitional supports - such as employment assistance -&#xD;
      as young men return home will help to improve their community stability and enhance their&#xD;
      psychological well-being, in turn, resulting in less likelihood that a person will become&#xD;
      incarcerated in the future.&#xD;

    <measure>Impulsivity</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks post release</time_frame>
    <description>Impulsivity is defined as a predisposition toward rapid, unplanned reactions to internal or external stimuli without regard to the negative consequences of these reactions to the impulsive individual or to others. Impulsivity will be measured using the Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS). The BIS is composed of 30 items describing common impulsive or non-impulsive (for reverse scored items) behaviors and preferences. Participants select a number on the following scale.1 if you rarely or never act or think that way, 2 if you occasionally think that way, 3 if you often think that way, or 4 if you almost or always think that way. A higher scores indicate greater impulsivity. The BIS assesses general impulsiveness on six first-order factors (attention, motor, self-control, cognitive complexity, perseverance, and cognitive instability impulsiveness) and three second-order factors (attentional, motor, and non-planning impulsiveness).</description>
