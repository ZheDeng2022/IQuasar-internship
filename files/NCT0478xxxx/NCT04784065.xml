  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study involving people receiving care at the Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center,&#xD;
      Houston Texas. We are studying people who have hand osteoarthritis (the most common form of&#xD;
      arthritis that involves the hand) and testing treatments for the condition with the hope that&#xD;
      we can help to improve hand pain as well as limit the damage that occurs related to the&#xD;
      arthritis. People who choose to participate, are randomly assigned to one of two treatments,&#xD;
      both expected to be helpful.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The research will be conducted at the following location(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baylor College of Medicine, Baylor St. Luke's Medical Center (BSLMC), and Michael E. DeBakey&#xD;
      Veterans Affairs Medical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants of this study are consented for the study, randomized into one of two treatment&#xD;
      groups for hand osteoarthritis, both expected to improve hand symptoms. At the beginning of&#xD;
      the study, many questionnaires, a physical exam, photographs of the hands, some x-rays, on a&#xD;
      limited few people, and MRI will be obtained. Then the participants will be provided&#xD;
      treatments for hand osteoarthritis based on the group wo which they were randomly assigned.&#xD;
      One aspect of one of the treatments is viewed as experimental but the risks related to the&#xD;
      treatment are considered to be low, so the risk-benefit ratio for participation in this study&#xD;
      are good. We see patients in follow up more frequently during the first month, and then at 3&#xD;
      months and then 6 months of follow up. At the final visit, we will repeat the xrays and the&#xD;
      MRIs.&#xD;
