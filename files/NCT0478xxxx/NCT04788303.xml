      This purpose of this study is to assess effects of a comprehensive, school-based nutrition&#xD;
      intervention package on anemia status, anthropometric indicators, school&#xD;
      performance/attendance, and development indicators among adolescents, and the knowledge,&#xD;
      attitudes, and practices of nutrition, agriculture, and WASH among parents, in Tanzania.&#xD;

      The Meals, Education, and Gardens for In-School Adolescents (MEGA) Project aims to implement&#xD;
      and evaluate a comprehensive, school-based nutrition intervention package among secondary&#xD;
      schools in Dodoma, Tanzania. The intervention will include four primary components: (1)&#xD;
      school garden, (2) school meal program, (3) agriculture, nutrition, and water, sanitation,&#xD;
      and hygiene (WASH) education, and (4) community workshops.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a cluster randomized trial with 3 arms, containing two schools each. At the&#xD;
      beginning of the academic year, six schools will be randomized to intervention or control.&#xD;
      Two schools will receive the full intervention package (school lunch, school garden, and&#xD;
      education), two schools will receive the partial intervention package (school garden and&#xD;
      education), and two schools will serve as control to receive the standard of care. Community&#xD;
      workshops will also be provided to parents of adolescents in full and partial intervention&#xD;
      schools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the full intervention schools, all adolescents will receive a midday meal, while a subset&#xD;
      of Form 1 adolescents will additionally participate in a school gardening program that&#xD;
      includes nutrition, agriculture, and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) education, led by&#xD;
      selected teachers. Parents of adolescents in full intervention schools will be invited to&#xD;
      participate in community workshops on nutrition, hygiene, and agricultural best practices,&#xD;
      led by community Agriculture Extension Workers (AEWs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the partial intervention schools, Form 1 adolescents will participate in the gardening and&#xD;
      education components described above, but will not receive the midday meal. Parents of&#xD;
      participating adolescents will also be invited to participate in the community workshops.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adolescents in control schools will not receive any of these interventions but will be&#xD;
      provided with standard of care practices at secondary schools in Dodoma. In addition,&#xD;
      teachers in control schools will receive a hard copy of educational materials on nutrition,&#xD;
      agriculture, and WASH to enhance their lesson plans. The intervention will take place over&#xD;
      the course of one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the MEGA project is to study the effects of the integrated intervention on the&#xD;
      nutrition and health of adolescents and their families in Tanzania. Ultimately, we aim to use&#xD;
      the findings from this study to inform the scale-up of future school and community-based&#xD;
      interventions to improve nutrition through training, improved crop production, and increased&#xD;
      consumption of vegetables.&#xD;
