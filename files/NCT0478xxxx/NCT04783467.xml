  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term goal of this study is to determine the efficacy of Time Restricted Eating (TRE)&#xD;
      for improving metabolic health, preventing cardiometabolic comorbidities, and improving&#xD;
      prognosis after endometrial cancer diagnosis. The primary objective of the protocol is to&#xD;
      conduct a 16-week randomized dietary crossover study to evaluate the feasibility, fidelity&#xD;
      and preliminary acceptability of TRE among endometrial cancer patients, and to provide proof&#xD;
      of principle that TRE can improve metabolic health in this population.&#xD;

      Enrollment: The study team will aim to recruit 15 endometrial cancer patients seen at the&#xD;
      Huntsman Cancer Hospital Clinics. Consent may be completed via phone/email or in-person with&#xD;
      the study clinical coordinator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary Intervention: Participants who are consented into the study will participate in a&#xD;
      16-week randomized dietary crossover intervention. The dietary intervention includes 5 study&#xD;
      visits, and features a baseline visit, 2-week run-in period, 4-week control diet schedule&#xD;
      with prepared frozen meals provided to participants, 4-week washout period, and a 6-week, 8&#xD;
      to 10-hour Time Restricted Eating (TRE) protocol (meal provision with 8 to 10-hour eating and&#xD;
      14 to 16-hour fasting periods). Women will be randomized to either control or TRE, then&#xD;
      crossover to the other condition. For the control schedule, women will receive frozen lunch&#xD;
      and dinner meals and be provided with a standardized breakfast and snacks menu, and there are&#xD;
      no restrictions on timing of eating. For the TRE schedule, women will receive prepared frozen&#xD;
      lunch and dinner meals as per the control schedule, but will be asked to consume daily meals,&#xD;
      snacks, and calorie-containing beverages within an 8 to 10-hour period that fits their&#xD;
      schedule. Fasting period will ramp up during the first week (e.g., Days 1-3, 12-14 h per day,&#xD;
      Days 4-6, 14-16 h per day, Days 7+, 16 h per day). Women will be asked to schedule the eating&#xD;
      period at the same time each day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits and Assessments: Women will attend in-person study visits at the Huntsman Cancer&#xD;
      Institute Center for Health Outcomes and Population Equity (HOPE).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline Visit (Visit 1): The clinical coordinator will obtain consent from the&#xD;
           participant. Once consented, women will complete questionnaires to capture information&#xD;
           on clinical and demographic factors, and chronotype. Height will be measured using&#xD;
           stadiometer, weight will be measured using calibrated scales, waist circumference with&#xD;
           measuring tape and blood pressure (BP) using an electronic BP monitor. Participants may&#xD;
           take home questionnaires, with mailer, to complete at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2-Week Run-In Period: The purpose of the run-in period is to record women's usual times&#xD;
           of eating episodes and appetite while following their habitual diet. Appetite will be&#xD;
           measured using the MyCircacianClock (mCC) phone app that has the capability to sample&#xD;
           subjects' current behaviors and experiences in real time in their natural environment.&#xD;
           Women will complete 3 x 24-hour dietary recalls on non-consecutive days (ASA-24) and a&#xD;
           physical activity recall (ACT24 available online or phone app, or via telephone&#xD;
           conference with the clinical coordinator). Sleep and activity will also be objectively&#xD;
           measured for 7-days using an Actiwatch.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 2: Women will provide fasting blood and stool samples. Weight, waist circumference&#xD;
           and blood pressure will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control OR TRE Schedules: The participants will be expected to follow their randomized&#xD;
           schedule for meal timing. During these schedules, for both study groups, participants&#xD;
           will record timing of eating episodes daily using the MyCircadianClock app, complete 3 x&#xD;
           24-hour recalls (ASA24), 1 x ACT24 activity recall, and 7-days of sleep/physical&#xD;
           activity will be objectively measured via Actiwatch.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 3: Women will provide fasting blood and stool samples. Weight, waist circumference&#xD;
           and blood pressure will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  4-Week Washout Period: During the washout period, women can return to their usual&#xD;
           lifestyle. Meals will not be provided during this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 4: Visit 4 will include a telephone call only to discuss the next study phase and&#xD;
           schedule meal provision.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 5: Women will provide fasting blood and stool samples. Weight, waist circumference&#xD;
           and blood pressure will be measured. An exit interview may occur in person or via&#xD;
           phone/video conference to ask questions about how well the intervention was tolerated&#xD;
           and allow participants to provide feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-Up: Approximately 6-months after consent and roughly 10 weeks after the end of&#xD;
           the dietary intervention, participants will be asked to complete a follow-up&#xD;
           questionnaire.&#xD;
