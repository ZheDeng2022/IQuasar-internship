             subject'sability to complete the study, would interfere with the interpretation of&#xD;
             safety or efficacy, or would present an undue risk to the subject. In cases of&#xD;
             uncertainty, the investigator may contact the medical monitor for clarification.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Evidence or history of a clinically significant disease or abnormality, which, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the investigator, would present and unacceptable safety risk to a subject's&#xD;

             interpretation of safety or efficacy data in the current study. COVID-19 infection is&#xD;
             defined as laboratory evidence of COVID-19 infection or by a constellation of&#xD;
