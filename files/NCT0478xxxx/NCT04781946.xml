  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The global obesity epidemic has led to increasing popularity of bariatric surgeries and a&#xD;
      parallel rise in the prevalence of related complications. Gastric sleeve stenosis (GSS)&#xD;
      complicates 0.1-3.9% of cases after Sleeve Gastrectomy (SG) and can result in significant&#xD;
      symptoms including nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, dysphagia, reflux and regurgitation.&#xD;
      There is no validated algorithm for the management of GSS, and available literature is&#xD;
      retrospective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the implementation of a predefined treatment algorithm for&#xD;
      management of GSS post SG will effectively and safely manage patients with this condition.&#xD;
      This single center, prospective, non-randomized pilot clinical trial to be performed at Johns&#xD;
      Hopkins Medical Institutes will describe the efficacy and safety of endoscopic pneumatic&#xD;
      balloon dilation (PBD), gastric peroral endoscopic myotomy (G-POEM) and Roux-en-Y gastric&#xD;
      bypass (RYGB) for the management of post-LSG GSS using a predefined treatment algorithm.&#xD;
      Patients with symptomatic, endoscopically or radiologically confirmed GSS greater than four&#xD;
      weeks from laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) who are treatment na√Øve will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is the rate of clinical success, defined an improvement in symptoms that&#xD;
      allowed the patient to avoid further intervention (outside of the predefined treatment&#xD;
      algorithm) with a resumption of adequate oral intake and at least 1-point reduction in the&#xD;
      Patient Assessment of upper Gastrointestinal Symptoms (PAGI-SYM) questionnaire, at 6 months&#xD;
      following last intervention. Secondary outcomes include rates of technical success&#xD;
      (completion of planned procedure), procedural success (defined as a 1-point reduction in&#xD;
      PAGI-SYM score at 8 weeks following procedure), endoscopic and radiologic resolution of&#xD;
      GSS-related findings, percentage of patients maintained off proton pump inhibitor (PPI)&#xD;
      therapy, time to recurrence of symptoms post-treatment in patients with recurrence, and rate&#xD;
      of adverse events. The expected study population is 30 participants with a study duration of&#xD;
      18 months. This study can potentially validate a treatment algorithm, thereby assisting&#xD;
      clinicians to select the most appropriate intervention for the treatment of post-LSG GSS.&#xD;
      Moreover, it may help improve outcomes and prevent unnecessary procedures in patients with&#xD;
      GSS.&#xD;
