    <textblock>
      This clinical trial evaluates the relationship between walking and sleeping habits and&#xD;
      surgical outcomes in patients with lung cancer. Early walking after surgery is associated&#xD;
      with decreased or less severe complications. Learning about how much patients walk may be&#xD;
      important in improving outcomes after surgery. Information gained from this trial may help&#xD;
      researchers develop interventions to improve outcomes after surgery and improve overall&#xD;
      quality of life after surgery in patients with lung cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Estimate the difference between each Fitbit arm and a control arm in Clavien-Dindo&#xD;
      Combined Postoperative Morbidity (POM) Score in the 30-day postoperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. For patients in Fitbit only arm (F0) and Fitbit integration arm (FB), evaluate the&#xD;
      differences in steps regained at each postoperative day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Quality of life before and after surgery using MD Anderson Symptom Inventory - Lung&#xD;
      Cancer (MDASI-LC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Hospital length of stay. IV. Hospital readmission rate within 30 days for lung surgery&#xD;
      related events. V. Return of bowel function. VI. Postoperative complications and step&#xD;
      numbers. VII. Fitbit user experience in the FB arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Sleep disturbances. II. Cost analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive usual care consisting of the clinician educating the patient on the&#xD;
      importance of increasing exercise activity in the preoperative period and early ambulation in&#xD;
      the postoperative setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive usual care consisting of the clinician educating the patient on the&#xD;
      importance of increasing exercise activity in the preoperative period and early ambulation in&#xD;
      the postoperative setting. Patients also receive a Fitbit to monitor step count.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM III: Patients receive usual care consisting of the clinician educating the patient on the&#xD;
      importance of increasing exercise activity in the preoperative period and walking in the&#xD;
      postoperative setting. Patients also receive a Fitbit device install and use the Fitbit app&#xD;
      on a smartphone. Postoperative step goals are as follows: Postoperative day (POD) 1: 25% of&#xD;
      baseline. Subsequent days will be increased by 10% until patient reaches baseline daily step&#xD;
      number. Five automatic daily reminders (delivered by the Fitbit Inspire HR^TM device itself)&#xD;
      to meet a minimum of 250 steps an hour. Postoperatively, patients will be invited to&#xD;
      participate in a private group with a leaderboard that consists of step numbers of other&#xD;
      participants in the study in an anonymous fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study intervention, patients are followed up at postoperative clinic and&#xD;
      at 30 days after surgery.&#xD;

Performance status&#xD;

Age&#xD;
Open vs. Minimally invasive (0 is best, 5 is worst.) 0 - No postoperative complications 1. - Minor complication resolved without intervention 2. - complication requiring pharmaceutical intervention 3. - complication requiring surgical, endoscopic or radiological intervention, 4. - life-threatening complication requiring intensive care 5. - complication leading to the patient's death.</description>
