      Detailed Description: This study is being done to demonstrate the feasibility, acceptability&#xD;
      and effectiveness of a telehealth Group Behavioral Activation Therapy (GBAT) for autistic&#xD;
      adults. GBAT is intended to help adults manage stress, anxiety, down moods, and anger.&#xD;
      Similar programs have been shown to be effective in other contexts but has not yet been used&#xD;
      for autistic adults or delivered via telehealth. Because this is a new intervention, the&#xD;
      investigators are interested in learning 1) whether GBAT can be done with autistic adults&#xD;
      (feasibility), 2) what autistic adults think about GBAT (acceptability), and 3) whether GBAT&#xD;
      is effective for helping autistic adults cope with their feelings. Results from this study&#xD;
      will be used to inform adaptation to the intervention and planning for future studies to&#xD;
      further explore its effectiveness. For this initial feasibility study, 8 autistic adults&#xD;
      (18-40 years old) with VIQ and NVIQ&gt;85, reading composite at least 6th grade level and&#xD;
      elevated symptoms of depression, anxiety or anger will be recruited.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in symptoms on the Adult Self Report (ASR)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 week study period; 4 week post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The ASR is a an assessment of adult psychopathology (e.g., anxiety, depression symptoms). Most of the items are on a 3 point scale including: (0) Not true, (1) Somewhat or sometimes true, and (2) Very often or often true.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Clinician Global Impairment rating</measure>
    <time_frame>10 week study period;</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI is a 7 point scale on which the clinician rates the severity of the client's impairment. The scale ranges from 1 (Normal, not at all ill) to 7 Extremely Ill; higher scores indicate more impairment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in symptoms on the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21</measure>
    <time_frame>10 week study period; 4 week post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The DASS-21 is a 21-item measure of depression and anxiety symptoms. The measure produces scores in 3 domains: depression, anxiety, and stress. The score ranges on each domain is from 0-42. Higher scores on each domain indicate more impairment/ severity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in distress on Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 week study period</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-9, assessed weekly, is a 9-item questionnaire of psychological function over the past week with all items on a &quot;0&quot; (not at all) to &quot;3&quot; (nearly every day) scale. Total scores range from 0 to 27; higher scores reflect greater levels of depressive symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in anxiety symptoms on the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire (GAD-7)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 week study period</time_frame>
    <description>The GAD-7, assessed weekly, is a 7-item questionnaire of anxiety symptoms over the past week with all items on a &quot;0&quot; (not at all) to &quot;3&quot;(nearly every day) scale. Total scores range from 0 to 21; higher scores reflect greater levels of anxiety.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Adaptive Behavior Assessment System - 3 (ABAS-3)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 week study period</time_frame>
    <description>The ABAS-3 is a measure of adaptive function that yields age-standardized scores for three domains (Conceptual, Social and Practical) and an overall Global Adaptive Composite. Each domain and the overall General Adaptive Composite result in a standard score, with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15 (scores between 86 and 114 are considered &quot;Average&quot; on this instrument; scores under 70 are classified as &quot;Extremely Low&quot; relative to same aged peers). Each domain is composed of several subdomains that yield scaled scale scores (Mean=10, SD=3), with scores between 7 and 13 falling in the &quot;Average&quot; range.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Behavioral Activation for Depression Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>10 week study period; 4 week post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The BADS is a 25-item measure designed to assess how clients become activated over the course of Behavior Activation treatment. There are 25 questions, each rated on a seven point scale ranging from 0 to 6. There are four subscales:&#xD;
AC = Activation subscale [score range 0 to 42] AR = Avoidance/Rumination subscale [score range 0-48] WS = Work/School Impairment subscale [score range 0-30] SI = Social Impairment subscale [score range 0-30] Higher scores indicate a better outcome on the Activation subscale. Higher scores indicate a worse outcome on the Avoidance/Rumination subscale, Work/School Impairment subscale, and Social Impairment subscale.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Idiographic target goals</measure>
    <time_frame>10 week study period; 4 week post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Clients are asked to identify 3 goals they would like to accomplish. There are no scores or scales. Each goal is a statement shared by the client relevant to their own experiences. Target goals are sensitive to change in treatment contexts.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Be 18-40 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Have a confirmed diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Have access to a device (e.g., computer with a webcam or smartphone) in order to&#xD;
             complete online surveys and participate in the telehealth videoconferencing sessions&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. *Have a VIQ and NVIQ of 85 or above&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. *Have at least a 6th grade reading composite&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. *Have elevated symptoms of depression, anxiety or anger. This will be determined based&#xD;
             on scoring above the borderline or mild threshold on at least one of 3 screening&#xD;
             measures (MINI; ASR; DASS-21).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Are younger than 18 years old, or older than 40 years old (Children are excluded&#xD;
             because the focus is on adapting GBAT for adults; Individuals above 40 are excluded to&#xD;
             restrict the adult focus to young adults that are more likely to be in similar life&#xD;
             stages).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Do not have an ASD diagnosis (because the study as the purpose of the current research&#xD;
             is to examine GBAT's feasibility with autistic adults).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Both VIQ and NVIQ below 85 OR less than 6th grade reading level&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Do not have elevated scores of depression, anxiety, or anger on the symptom screening&#xD;
             measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Are unable to understand English fluently (because the instruments being investigated&#xD;
             are currently only validated in English and the intervention will be delivered in&#xD;
             English).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Are currently enrolled in another behavioral therapy or psychotherapy targeting&#xD;
             depression,&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. the PI's clinical judgment that it would not be in the adult's best interest to be&#xD;
             enrolled (e.g., due to factors that may affect their engagement or comfort in the&#xD;
             group).&#xD;
