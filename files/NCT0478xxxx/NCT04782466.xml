  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have previously shown that youth with MS are very inactive, and that&#xD;
      vigorous physical activity is associated with higher levels of well-being and lower MS&#xD;
      disease activity in youth. Yet, no effective physical activity interventions have been&#xD;
      developed for youth with MS to date. The investigators have taken input from youth with MS to&#xD;
      create a Smartphone-based app (the ATOMIC - Active Teens with Multiple Sclerosis - App) that&#xD;
      provides tailored physical activity information and coaching, provides tools to increase&#xD;
      social connectedness, and promotes physical activity. This proposed research will therefore&#xD;
      address the problem of inactivity in youth with MS by studying an intervention to increase&#xD;
      physical activity.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Youth with MS have highly active disease and report high levels of fatigue and depression. As&#xD;
      MS is a lifetime diagnosis, amelioration of these outcomes may have a sustained and important&#xD;
      effect on the lives of these youth. Effective interventions oriented towards improving these&#xD;
      outcomes are therefore imperative to develop and study. Importantly, recent work suggests&#xD;
      that increased PA has the potential to improve brain tissue integrity, re-myelination, mental&#xD;
      health outcomes, and quality of life in youth with MS. The investigators have demonstrated&#xD;
      associations between lower levels of PA and higher levels of depressive symptoms and fatigue&#xD;
      in these youth over time. Furthermore, the investigators have demonstrated an association&#xD;
      between higher levels of PA and lower levels of disease activity in youth with MS.&#xD;
      Importantly, preliminary work by the investigators shows that youth with MS have very low&#xD;
      levels of PA. Increasing PA, therefore, has the potential to have both disease-modifying and&#xD;
      psychosocial benefits in youth with MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have developed a user-driven app and program, the ATOMIC intervention,&#xD;
      which addresses barriers to PA participation the investigators previously identified. The&#xD;
      program provides youth with tools to increase goal setting, PA self-efficacy, and knowledge,&#xD;
      and is embedded in a youth-focused app that is supported by health coaches. Notably, in&#xD;
      preliminary work, the investigators have found the ATOMIC program to be acceptable to youth,&#xD;
      and furthermore, that it was associated with a 31% increase in physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These strong preliminary results support moving forward with this proposed research, a&#xD;
      multi-center randomized wait-list controlled trial (RCT) of the ATOMIC mobile app and&#xD;
      coaching-based physical activity (PA) intervention in youth with multiple sclerosis (MS). The&#xD;
      proposed study will examine the extent to which the intervention can change PA levels in this&#xD;
      cohort. Additional goals will be to evaluate the effect of the ATOMIC intervention on&#xD;
      behavioural change mediators, fitness, and psychosocial outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, the investigators will recruit 56 youth with MS followed at three tertiary&#xD;
      children's hospitals with large, established pediatric MS programs: The Hospital for Sick&#xD;
      Children, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, and the University of Alabama at Birmingham.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>At baseline, participants will be randomized using online research randomizer software, in blocks of 2 each, balanced for the clinical site, sex, and pubertal status (using self-selected Tanner staging), which may independently predict physical fitness level and has also been associated with physical activity level especially in adolescent girls to either a 6-month PA intervention or waitlist attention-control condition. The research coordinator will request the randomization of the participant as provided by the online research randomizer at the completion of the baseline test and will inform the study participant of their assigned study arm.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>Entire study - up to 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Accelerometry is a valid device-based physical activity measurement tool that will be used to determine physical activity. Children will be asked to wear the accelerometer daily for a week, and the investigators will analyze cases that have four or more days of data with â‰¥10 hours of wear time per day. The investigators will process the accelerometer data and use step counts as well as validated cut-offs to determine time spent in sedentary, light, and Moderate to Vigorous Physical Activity (MVPA) (minutes/day). The focus of the investigators will be to determine the effect of the ATOMIC intervention on device-measured physical activity levels.</description>
