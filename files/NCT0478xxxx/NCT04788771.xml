  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patient comfort and satisfaction of inguinal hernia repairs can be affected by the anesthesia&#xD;
      technique chosen in addition to the surgical method. In our study, we aimed to compare the&#xD;
      anesthesia method used in patients during laparoscopic total extraperitoneal hernia repair,&#xD;
      which is a minimally invasive method.It was planned to evaluate the patients' quality of&#xD;
      life, pain conditions, additional medical support needs for pain, length of hospital stay,&#xD;
      duration of surgery, complications during and after surgery and recurrence rates.In addition,&#xD;
      it was planned to compare the effects of the anesthesia method used on the lung capacity of&#xD;
      the patients. The most important achievement of the study will be to show that laparoscopic&#xD;
      hernia repair, which is frequently performed by intubation, can be performed safely with the&#xD;
      Laryngeal mask.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was designed as a prospective randomized study, and a total of 100 patients were&#xD;
      planned to be evaluated. Laparoscopic total extraperitoneal hernia repair will be performed&#xD;
      by anesthesia with laryngeal mask and treceal intubation. Patients with a lariyngeal mask&#xD;
      will be named as &quot;group 1&quot;, and patients who undergo tracheal intubation will be named as&#xD;
      &quot;group 2&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients diagnosed with inguinal hernia radiologically and diagnosed with ultrasound will be&#xD;
      operated. Patients between the ages of 18 and 75 years will be included in the study.&#xD;
      Patients with relapse will be excluded. All patients will be evaluated for preoperative&#xD;
      anesthesia and their suitability for laryngeal mask or tracheal intubation will be examined.&#xD;
      Patients considered unsuitable for anyone will not be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be explained in two methods before surgery and their patients will be&#xD;
      randomized. Randomization will be done on the website www.randomizer.org. All patients will&#xD;
      be entered on the website by numbering and the method chosen by the website will be applied&#xD;
      according to the order of arrival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be placed in the supine position under operating room conditions and anesthesia&#xD;
      will be appropriate. After anesthesia, the surgical procedure will begin. The first incision&#xD;
      time will be accepted as the surgery start time, and the end time of skin suturization will&#xD;
      be recorded as the end of the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VAS scores of the patients at the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 6th and 12th hours after surgery will be&#xD;
      learned and recorded by the service nurses. Additional medical needs of patients due to pain&#xD;
      will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data and additional diseases of the patients will be recorded. Operation times,&#xD;
      hospitalization times, wound infections, seroma, scrotal edema and pain scores will be&#xD;
      recorded. Complications developed during the operation will be recorded. After surgery,&#xD;
      patients' nausea, vomiting, headache, shoulder pain and pain scores will be compared.&#xD;
      Patients will be called to the general surgery outpatient clinic in the first week, first&#xD;
      month, third month, and sixth month after the operation.&#xD;
