  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain is a complex, multidimensional, and subjective experience; and although, investigators&#xD;
      use a single word &quot;pain&quot;, to describe our perception, multiple mechanisms contribute to the&#xD;
      generation and maintenance of pain. To help diagnosing and improving pain management, there&#xD;
      is a need for developing tools. These tools may include measurements of substances, or&#xD;
      biomarkers, in the blood; e.g. small molecules called microRNA and proteins. In these&#xD;
      experiments, the investigators would like to investigate how the psychological response to&#xD;
      stress and pain alters the impulses in the brain and the content of microRNA and proteins in&#xD;
      the blood. The future aim is to identify patients in high risk of developing and maintaining&#xD;
      chronic pain and to be able to treat chronic pain efficiently.&#xD;
