  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be an open-label, randomised sequence, 2-period, 2-cohort, 2-treatment in&#xD;
      each cohort, cross-over study in healthy subjects (males and females of non-childbearing&#xD;
      potential), performed at a single study centre.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will comprise:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A screening period of maximum 28 days;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two treatment periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Treatment Period 1 starts with admission to the Clinical Unit on Day -1, followed&#xD;
                by dosing on Day 1 with the assigned treatment (A, B, C, or D) as per assigned&#xD;
                cohort and treatment sequence, followed by a washout period of at least 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Treatment Period 2 starts with admission to Clinical Unit on Day -1, followed by&#xD;
                dosing on Day 1 with cross-over treatment as per assigned cohort, followed by a&#xD;
                follow-up period of 7 to 10 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A follow-up visit/early termination visit at 7 to 10 days after the last investigation&#xD;
           medicinal product (IMP) administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be assigned to either Cohort 1 (tacrolimus) or to Cohort 2 (cyclosporin). Each&#xD;
      cohort will have 2 treatment periods. Subjects in each cohort will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      one of 2 treatment sequences (AB|BA or CD|DC) where,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment A: Tacrolimus&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment B: Tacrolimus + SZC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment C: Cyclosporin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment D: Cyclosporin + SZC&#xD;
