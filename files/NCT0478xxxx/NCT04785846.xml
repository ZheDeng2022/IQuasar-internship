&#xD;
      1.12 SELECTION METHOD&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with coronary artery disease and stable angina, silent ischemia or non-ST-segment&#xD;
      elevation acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina or non-Q infarction) who are going to&#xD;
      undergo PCI and who have stenoses to be treated in vessels with a diameter equal to or less&#xD;
      than 2.5mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.13 METHOD OF EVALUATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major adverse cardiac events will be analyzed, which are defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Death of cardiac origin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nonfatal infarction related to the target vessel. Definitions according to the third&#xD;
           universal definition of myocardial infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  New revascularization of the target lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the following will be analyzed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stent thrombosis. Definitions according to the ARC (Academic Research Consortium).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bleeding not related to surgical revascularization. Classification of BARC bleeding&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.14 REGISTRATION SYSTEM&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collection notebook (eCRD) will be in electronic format. The database with on-line&#xD;
      collection will be prepared by the company in charge of managing the study (CRO). Each&#xD;
      variable to be collected will have a field where the information will be entered manually or&#xD;
      one of the options available for the field in question will be chosen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.15 PROCEDURE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure will be performed according to each site's standard practice. The lesion will&#xD;
      be treated with a RESOLUTE- ONYX™ zotarolimus-eluting stent of 2, 2.25 or 2.5 mm in diameter.&#xD;
      The choice, by the operator, of stent size and length will be made according to visual&#xD;
      estimation. The need for additional stents will be at the operator's discretion but they&#xD;
      should always be RESOLUTE-ONYX™ in the same lesion. Direct stenting is recommended. The need&#xD;
      for predilatation or postdilatation and the balloons used will be at the operator's&#xD;
      discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An attempt should be made to achieve a stent to artery diameter ratio of 1.1 to 1.2 to 1.1.&#xD;
      1.2 to 1. The procedure will be considered successful when the device is implanted with a&#xD;
      residual stenosis of less than 20% and TIMI 3 flow in the treated vessel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In cases of multivessel disease, RESOLUTE-ONYX™ stents will always be used in lesions in&#xD;
      vessels with diameters less than or equal to 2.5 mm, even if performed at different times. In&#xD;
      the case of stenosis in vessels of 2.75 mm or more, the stents considered appropriate by the&#xD;
      operator will be used, although it is recommended that if a DES is chosen, it should be&#xD;
      zotarolimus-eluting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The access route can be radial or femoral. Antiplatelet therapy and anticoagulation will be&#xD;
      performed according to the clinical practice guidelines&#xD;
      (http://www.escardio.org/GUIDELINES-SURVEYS/Pages/welcome.aspx) and the protocols established&#xD;
      in each center. It is recommended to take into account the bleeding risk according to the&#xD;
      CRUSADE scale score. Double antiplatelet therapy and its maintenance time will be performed&#xD;
      according to the clinical practice guidelines and protocols of the center. Doses of&#xD;
      unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin during the procedure and the use of&#xD;
      bivalirudin or abciximab will be at the operator's discretion. The drugs used and their&#xD;
      dosage will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical treatment at discharge will be at the discretion of the corresponding cardiologist&#xD;
      following clinical practice guidelines. In diabetic or prediabetic patients, fasting blood&#xD;
      glucose (&gt;8h) and glycated hemoglobin A1C will be determined during admission, according to&#xD;
      hospital practice, for the management of these patients as described in the clinical practice&#xD;
      guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical follow-up, once discharged, will be carried out by telephone or in person at 30&#xD;
      days, 6 months and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.16 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be performed with SPSS software in the most current version&#xD;
      available at the time of analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation&#xD;
&#xD;
      If we estimate that the proportion of MACE per year with zotarolimus stents in small vessel&#xD;
      PCI is 8-10% and the best published observed outcome, in this case with everolimus stents, is&#xD;
      4%, data expected to be achieved with the stent used in this observational registry, assuming&#xD;
      a risk of 5% and a ß 20% risk with a bilateral contrast and a 10% loss to follow-up, we would&#xD;
      need to include 320 patients to demonstrate this difference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data processing&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study-specific data management plan will be prepared defining all aspects of data&#xD;
      management and processing. This data management plan will include in detail:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Validation processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Query resolution process.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Structure and fundamental parts of the study data collection application.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General data considerations including validation rules and normality ranges used for the&#xD;
           different parameters collected in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be stored in a relational database on a MySQL server. The application will be&#xD;
      duly protected by means of a SSL security certificate for the correct encryption of the&#xD;
      transferred data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discrete variables will be described by providing frequency and percentage. For the&#xD;
      description of continuous variables, the mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and&#xD;
      maximum will be used. The incidence of MACE at 1 month, 6 months and 1 year, will be&#xD;
      described by frequency and percentage in each of the periods indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differences between proportions will be analyzed according to test 2. Differences between&#xD;
      discrete and continuous variables according to t-Student or ANOVA (for discrete variables of&#xD;
      several categories) and the comparison between two continuous variables with a regression&#xD;
      model, if the distributions are normal, or the respective nonparametric tests, if they are&#xD;
      not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Event-free survival is defined as the time elapsed from the time the patient enters the study&#xD;
      until the first major cardiovascular event occurs. A Kaplan Meyer analysis will be performed&#xD;
      for event-free survival presenting the number of events, censored and median event-free&#xD;
      survival and its 95% confidence interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A logistic regression analysis will be performed to determine those possible factors that may&#xD;
      determine the occurrence of a cardiovascular event at 12 months. For the construction of the&#xD;
      model, those variables considered potentially influential under clinical criteria will be&#xD;
      selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.17 ADVERSE EVENTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the purposes of this protocol, an adverse event is any undesirable medical episode that&#xD;
      occurs in a patient. This definition is not dependent on causal relationship to the stent or&#xD;
      protocol requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If it is established that an adverse event has occurred, the investigator should obtain all&#xD;
      the information necessary to complete the adverse event form in the data collection form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the characteristics of this study, only those AA that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
      investigator, are relevant and/or related to the therapy under study will be collected&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.18 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (SAEs)&#xD;
&#xD;
      All serious adverse events should be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours of the&#xD;
      investigator becoming aware of the event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An adverse event is considered serious if:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Causes death&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Produces a serious deterioration in the patient's health, which:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Causes a life-threatening injury or illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Causes permanent impairment of a bodily structure or function&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Requires hospitalization of the patient or a prolongation of hospitalization, if&#xD;
                already hospitalized&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Requires medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent impairment of a body&#xD;
                structure or function permanent impairment of a bodily structure or function&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  In addition, any major adverse cardiac event (MACE) Requires notification within 24&#xD;
                hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All serious adverse events should be followed up until they are resolved (with or without&#xD;
      sequelae).&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.19 INFORMED CONSENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before being admitted to the study and in accordance with current regulations, the patient&#xD;
      must give written consent to participate in the study, once he/she has been informed of the&#xD;
      nature, scope and possible consequences of the study in a language understandable to him/her.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.20 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the standards of good clinical practice (GCP) applicable to epidemiological&#xD;
      studies will be followed to ensure that the design, conduct and communication of the data are&#xD;
      reliable and that the rights and integrity of the participating subjects are protected while&#xD;
      maintaining the confidentiality of their data, in accordance with EU directives, the&#xD;
      Declaration of Helsinki and local regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.21 ETHICAL COMMITTEES&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study protocol will be submitted to the Clinical Research Ethics Committee (C.E.I.C.) of&#xD;
      the Complejo Asistencial Universitario de León (CAULE) (National Coordinating Center of the&#xD;
      study) for approval before initiating the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The modifications of the protocol as well as those of the patient information sheet and&#xD;
      informed consent will be sent to the CEIC to obtain its approval before its application.&#xD;
