  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposed study plans to develop and evaluate a patient-oriented, technology-based,&#xD;
      symptom monitoring system that reports symptoms experienced by children with cancer to their&#xD;
      parents and health care providers.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer is a leading cause of death and disability in children under 15 years of age. Its&#xD;
      unrelieved symptoms and side effects of often-aggressive treatments can lead to poor&#xD;
      psychosocial functioning and decreased health-related quality of life (HRQOL) for patients&#xD;
      and their families. Barriers at the patient, healthcare provider and system levels can&#xD;
      contribute to poor symptom management. A technology-based program can minimize these barriers&#xD;
      by routinely collecting and interpreting patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and patient/parent&#xD;
      contextual data in pediatric oncology ambulatory settings in a manner that is efficient,&#xD;
      actionable by physicians, supports engagement of patients and families with their health and&#xD;
      care, and improves clinical processes and outcomes. This proposed project will develop and&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness of such a program: Symptom Monitoring &amp; Systematic Assessment and&#xD;
      Reporting System in Young Survivors (SyMon-SAYS). We hypothesize that the SyMon-SAYS&#xD;
      intervention will decrease parent-perceived barriers to managing their child's symptoms,&#xD;
      decrease patient symptom burden, increase patients' and parents' self-efficacy, and&#xD;
      ultimately increase patient HRQOL.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will be randomly assigned to Group A (SyMon-SAYS intervention) or B (waitlist-control), stratified by gender, age (8-12 vs 13-17), and type of cancer (brain tumor vs. leukemia vs. others). To achieve allocation concealment, the computer-based data management system will assign participants to one of two groups after the study enrollment procedures. A permuted block sequence will be used. Participants will be informed of their group assignment (Group A or B) after the baseline assessment. Participants will complete a 9-item SyMon-SAYS Weekly Symptom Assessment Scale via Epic MyChart patient portal during the intervention phase (Group A: Wk1-16 or Group B: Wk9-16)</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The adherence to the SyMon-SAYS Intervention will be evaluated by using the percentage of dyads completing the symptom assessments at all time-points (16 weeks for Group A participants and 8 weeks for Group B participants), excluding those who are off-study or deceased.</description>

    <description>Evidence of decreased or maintained symptom burden as measured by the SyMon-SAYS symptom checklist from baseline to week 8 (primary analysis) and from week 9 to week 16. Each symptom is rated by using a 5-point rating scale and will be evaluated separately. Higher scores represent worse symptom burden.</description>

    <description>Evidence of decreased or maintained perceived symptom barriers as measured by a modified 23-item Symptom Management Barriers Questionnaire checklist from baseline to week 8 (primary analysis) and from week 9 to week 19. Possible scores range from 23 - 115. Higher scores represent more perceived barriers.</description>

    <description>Evidence of improved or maintained health related quality of life (physical function, fatigue, depressive symptom, anxiety, anger, social functioning), as measured by the pediatric Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System, PROMIS, (child self-report version) from baseline to week 8 as well as from week 9 to week 16. Scores will be reported by using a T-score system, in which mean of the norming group =50 and SD=10. Higher scores represent better functioning (mobility, upper extremity function, peer relationships) or worse symptoms (depression, anxiety, anger and fatigue).</description>

    <description>Evidence of improved or maintained self-efficacy in managing symptoms related to cancer therapy as measured by using the NIH Toolbox Self-Efficacy (child self-reported version) from baseline to week 8 and from week 9 to week 16. Scores will be reported by using a T-score metric, with a general population mean=50 and SD=10. Higher scores represent better self-efficacy.</description>

    <description>Participants will complete a 9-item SyMon-SAYS symptom assessment checklist every week during the intervention phase (Intervention Group: weeks 1-16; Waitlist Control: weeks 9-16) through Epic MyChart via mobile app, computer or tablet. Patients' symptom scores will be monitored and reported to their oncology care providers. When a patient symptom score trigger threshold is met, the system will generate an email alert through Epic (electronic medical record system) messaging to the provider. The provider will take appropriate actions using his/her clinical judgement, including contacting patients and families when needed. Symptom scores overtime will be available in MyChart (patient-facing component of the Epic electronic medical record system) for patients and parents to review and to discuss with the child's provider during clinical visits.</description>
