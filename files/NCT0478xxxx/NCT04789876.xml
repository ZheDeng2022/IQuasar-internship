  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multi-centred randomized, open label-controlled trial consists of hemodialysis (HD)&#xD;
      patients identified with hyperphosphatemia (&gt;1.78mmol/L). The intervention group received a&#xD;
      phosphate mobile app and the control group received one-off dietary counselling for 12 weeks.&#xD;
      Serum phosphate was measured pre-and post-intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-centred randomized, open label-controlled trial where a total of 66 HD&#xD;
      patients (33 intervention vs 33 control) with hyperphosphatemia were recruited from&#xD;
      government, private and non-governmental organization settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who consented were subjected to screening for identification of hyperphosphatemia&#xD;
      and other eligibility criteria. Patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were grouped&#xD;
      according to shift and block randomized to either the intervention or control group using a&#xD;
      web-based randomiser.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group received a phosphate mobile app for 12 weeks and the control group&#xD;
      received one-off phosphate counselling delivered by a dietitian with a phosphate booklet.&#xD;
      During the 12 weeks study period, patients in both control and intervention groups were&#xD;
      assessed at baseline and 12 weeks for changes in serum phosphorus, serum corrected calcium,&#xD;
      phosphate knowledge, dietary intake and phosphate binder adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These parameters were compared at baseline and 12 weeks for within- and between-group.&#xD;

    <description>A questionnaire used to assess phosphate knowledge and contained 18 questions related to phosphate treatment, disease pathophysiology, dialysis treatment, phosphate binder, dietary phosphate and responsibility. The questionnaire was an expert validated phosphate questionnaire with back-to-back-translation for English, Malay, and Chinese questionnaire. Each correct response was awarded 1 point, and all correct answers were summed to achieve a total score. The possible total score ranged from 0 to 18. All subjects completed this questionnaire at baseline and 12-week after the intervention.</description>
