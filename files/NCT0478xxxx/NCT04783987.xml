  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with spesific learning disorders have differences in motor and cognitive abilities&#xD;
      compared to normal developing children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motor tasks as walking are not just have a motor components and also require a cognitive&#xD;
      process to realize. Therefore cognitive abilities may effect motor performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In daily life, individuals perform dual or multitasks instead of single tasks naturally. Dual&#xD;
      task is defined as the concurrent performance of two tasks that can be performed&#xD;
      independently. Also dual tasks may be created from different tasks combinations such as a&#xD;
      motor-motor dual task or motor-cognitive dual task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, aim of the study is to compare gait parameters with healthy controls in single and&#xD;
      dual task conditions in children with Special Learning Difficulties.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The fifth edition of the The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5)&#xD;
      opted for a categorical approach that introduced the Specific Learning Difficulties.&#xD;
      Accordingly, it is thought that specific learning difficulties include many characteristics&#xD;
      such as genetic risk, environmental risk factors, developmental characteristics, comorbidity&#xD;
      and cognitive weaknesses. According to DSM-5, Specific Learning Difficulties are difficulties&#xD;
      in using learning and school skills, which last at least six months, and are characterized by&#xD;
      the presence of at least one of the following symptoms, despite the necessary attempts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Slowness and mistakes in reading words&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Difficulties in reading comprehension&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Problems with spelling&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Written expression difficulties&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Number perception and calculation problems experienced&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Numerical reasoning problems. In the literature, there are explanations about many&#xD;
           cognitive limitations in children with specific learning difficulties, such as&#xD;
           information processing, perceptual motor skills, processing of visual stimuli,&#xD;
           phonological approach and the theory of cerebellum disorder. All of these cognitive&#xD;
           limitations can also affect the dual task performance of these children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In daily life, individuals perform dual or multitasks instead of single tasks naturally. Dual&#xD;
      task is defined as the concurrent performance of two tasks that can be performed&#xD;
      independently. Also dual tasks may be created from different tasks combinations such as a&#xD;
      motor-motor dual task or motor-cognitive dual task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, no study investigating the effect of specific learning difficulties on walking&#xD;
      parameters in single and dual task conditions has been found. In the light of the information&#xD;
      is obtained from the literature, the gait parameters of children diagnosed with specific&#xD;
      learning difficulties in single and dual task conditions may differ from the healthy control&#xD;
      group. Therefore, this study's primary goal is to compare gait parameters in single and dual&#xD;
      task conditions in children with Special Learning Disabilities with healthy controls.&#xD;
