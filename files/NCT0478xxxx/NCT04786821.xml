  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory disease of the central nervous system.&#xD;
      Lack of physical activity is common in people with MS (pwMS). This can lead to several&#xD;
      comorbid conditions such as obesity, metabolic syndrome, osteoporosis, hypertension, diabetes&#xD;
      and worse prognosis. An increasing number of studies suggest that physical exercise can play&#xD;
      an important role in managing symptoms, preventing complications and comorbidities in pwMS,&#xD;
      and may possibly be neuroprotective. However, doing exercise can be very challenging for pwMS&#xD;
      who have moderate/severe mobility disability and who have problems with walking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project, the investigators will explore the use of a powered Exoskeleton as an&#xD;
      exercise tool for people with moderate to severe difficulty walking due to MS. Powered&#xD;
      Exoskeletons are wearable robots that offer opportunity to persons with lower limb weakness&#xD;
      to stand and walk. The Exoskeleton-assisted training provides active training with&#xD;
      potentially much less intervention needed from therapists. However, it is not clear whether&#xD;
      pwMS can walk with a powered Exoskeleton at speeds and intensities sufficient to positively&#xD;
      affect health and fitness outcomes. Thus, in this study, the investigators aim to explore&#xD;
      whether using an Exoskeleton will enable people with MS to exercise at a moderate intensity&#xD;
      and whether people with MS find this acceptable and safe to do on a regular basis. The&#xD;
      investigators will also explore whether training with an Exoskeleton can improve walking. The&#xD;
      investigators will train 12 patients with MS to walk with an Exoskeleton twice a week for 8&#xD;
      weeks. The investigators will compare the effects with another group of 12 patients who will&#xD;
      do exercises with a fitness instructor twice a week for 8 weeks. The investigators will study&#xD;
      whether walking with Exoskeleton is better than fitness training in terms of fitness&#xD;
      outcomes, walking and cognitive, psychological factors.&#xD;
