  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study is to elucidate the beneficial effect of a dietary supplement&#xD;
      with phenolic compounds in patients with OA versus ascorbic acid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis of the data is expected to clarify the role of the new supplement as one with a&#xD;
      positive effect on OA-related biomarkers, on functional abilities and on the quality of life&#xD;
      of patients with OA.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>A randomized double-blind clinical intervention with two parallel groups lasting 3 months is proposed to elucidate the beneficial effect of a novel food supplement on OA.&#xD;
Participants will undergo clinical and biochemical testing and will provide a complete medical history and history of the disease. Demographics, smoking, alcohol consumption, eating habits and physical activity, pain, and functional inability to enroll in the study will also be recorded.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>WOMAC™ Osteoarthritis Index Pain Subscale</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>It is a self-administered questionnaire consisting of 24 items divided into 3 subscales:&#xD;
Pain (5 items): during walking, using stairs, in bed, sitting or lying, and standing upright&#xD;
Stiffness (2 items): after first waking and later in the day&#xD;
Physical Function (17 items): using stairs, rising from sitting, standing, bending, walking, getting in / out of a car, shopping, putting on / taking off socks, rising from bed, lying in bed, getting in / out of bath, sitting, getting on / off toilet, heavy domestic duties, light domestic duties The test questions are scored on a scale of 0-4, which correspond to: None (0), Mild (1), Moderate (2), Severe (3), and Extreme (4).&#xD;
The scores for each subscale are summed up, with a possible score range of 0-20 for Pain, 0-8 for Stiffness, and 0-68 for Physical Function. Higher scores on the WOMAC indicate worse pain, stiffness, and functional limitations.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analogue Scale - VAS</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Visual Analogue Scale - VAS is a unidimensional measure of pain intensity. It is a measurement instrument that tries to measure a characteristic or attitude that is believed to range across a continuum of values and cannot easily be directly measured.</description>
