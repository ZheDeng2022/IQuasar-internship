    <textblock>
      In upper extremity surgeries, the brachial plexus block can be performed with different&#xD;
      techniques at various levels depending on the proximal and distal level of the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As an alternative to the infraclavicular brachial plexus block, which has been used for many&#xD;
      years and which we routinely perform to every pediatric patient under general anesthesia;&#xD;
      Costoclavicular block is recommended due to its advantages such as short application time,&#xD;
      single injection and sufficient ultrasound imaging, and its use is becoming widespread. There&#xD;
      are studies comparing these two methods. However in this study, we aim to compare the&#xD;
      postoperative analgesic effects of US-guided costoclavicular technique with US-guided&#xD;
      supraclavicular technique, which is more common for many years and is performed 2-3 cm&#xD;
      proximal to the costoclavicular block area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the block application, the US imaging time, the difficulty level of needle imaging,&#xD;
      the number of maneuvers required to reach the target image, whether additional maneuvers are&#xD;
      required according to the local anesthetic distribution, the success of the block and the&#xD;
      duration of the surgery, the total application time of the block and the duration of general&#xD;
      anesthesia will be recorded. Mean arterial pressure and heart rate will be recorded at&#xD;
      30-minute intervals during the surgery. Standardized for pediatric patients The FLACC and&#xD;
      Wong-Baker pain scores will be followed first 24 hours after surgery. The patient will be&#xD;
      examined for pain, motor and sensation, and analgesic doses will be recorded if used. Time to&#xD;
      first pain identification, duration of sleep, patient and surgeon satisfaction will be&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rarely onset of hemidiaphragmatic paralysis during supraclavicular block reduces its use.&#xD;
      Costoclavicular block could be a safe and effective alternative. One of our seconder&#xD;
      objectives is to assess the incidence of hemidiaphragmatic paralysis following&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided supraclavicular block and compare it to that of costoclavicular block. For&#xD;
      this purpose diaphragmatic excursion is imaging by M-mode ultrasonography 30 minutes after&#xD;
      extubation. Absence of diaphragmatic excursion during a sniff test or sighing defined the&#xD;
      hemidiaphragmatic paralysis.&#xD;

      Peripheral nerve blocks; It is widely used in daily practice for anesthesia or as a part of&#xD;
      multimodal analgesia in most surgical procedures. In upper extremity surgeries, the brachial&#xD;
      plexus block can be performed with different techniques at various levels depending on the&#xD;
      proximal and distal level of the surgery. In this study, the aim is to compare postoperative&#xD;
      analgesic effects of these two ultrasound-guided techniques in pediatric patients.&#xD;
&#xD;

      technique with the supraclavicular technique, which is more common for many years and is&#xD;
      performed 2-3 cm proximal to the costoclavicular block area. Thus demonstrate the safety of&#xD;
      upper extremity blocks, which is an important part of multimodal analgesia, and to determine&#xD;
      the most ideal technique in the pediatric patient group who will undergo upper extremity&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the block application, the US imaging time, the difficulty level of needle imaging,&#xD;
      the number of maneuvers required to reach the target image, whether additional maneuvers are&#xD;
