      The goal of this R34 planning project is to test the feasibility and acceptability of a&#xD;
      12-week modified diabetes and hypertension self-management program using trained Health&#xD;
      Coaches.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      West Virginians have one of the highest prevalence of comorbid diabetes and hypertension in&#xD;
      the nation that pose an enormous disease and economic burden in this medically underserved&#xD;
      state. Self-management of these two commonly found chronic conditions are an essential&#xD;
      component of comprehensive disease management. The goal of this R34 planning project is to&#xD;
      test the feasibility and acceptability of a 12-week culturally-tailored, multimodal, diabetes&#xD;
      and hypertension self-management program with a core (diet and physical activity) versus core&#xD;
      plus (diet, physical activity and medication adherence) to an enhanced usual care (EUC)&#xD;
      control group. Seventy-five eligible adults with comorbid diabetes and hypertension will be&#xD;
      randomized with a 1:1:1 ratio, based on allocation sequence generated by the bio-statistician&#xD;
      investigator in the team. The study will examine the extent to which key components (diet,&#xD;
      physical activity, and medication adherence) contribute to the differences in clinical&#xD;
      outcomes (HbA1c and blood pressure) between three groups using quantitative and qualitative&#xD;
      focus groups and the RE-AIM evaluation framework. The longer term effects of the intervention&#xD;
      will be evaluated in a subsequent R01 clinical trial.&#xD;

    <description>All participants will be assessed regarding the number of days they exercise using two survey questions from the Summary of Diabetes Self-care activities measure by Toolbert et al., Diabetes Care, 2000. The description of the questions are as follow: Q1. &quot;On how many of the last SEVEN DAYS did you participate in at least 30 minutes of physical activity? (please list the total minutes of continuous activity, including walking)&quot; 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 &amp; Q2. &quot;On how many of the last SEVEN DAYS did you participate in a specific exercise session (such as swimming, walking, biking) other than what you do around the house or as part of your work?&quot; 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7). The total exercise score will be calculated by the mean number of days for the two questions). Changes in mean number of days exercised will be assessed at baseline and at the completion of the program.</description>
