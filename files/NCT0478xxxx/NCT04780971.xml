      ULTRA-CTO is a prospective multicentre non-randomised investigator-initiated trial designed&#xD;
      to enrol 200 subjects with an indication for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of&#xD;
      chronic total occluded (CTO) coronary artery and who have at least one intermediate&#xD;
      (angiographically 30-90%) stenosis in a non-CTO vessel or major side branch of the CTO vessel&#xD;
      with a diameter of at least 2 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study is to assess the predictive value of post-PCI resting&#xD;
      full-cycle ratio (RFR) and fractional flow reserve (FFR) with regard to Fractional flow&#xD;
      reserve (SSR) in CTO patients.&#xD;

      ULTRA-CTO is a prospective multicentre non-randomised investigator-initiated trial designed&#xD;
      to enrol 200 subjects with an indication for PCI CTO and who have at least one intermediate&#xD;
      (angiographically 30-90%) stenosis in a non-CTO vessel or major side branch of the CTO vessel&#xD;
      with a diameter of at least 2mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study is to evaluate both the value of post-PCI RFR and post-PCI&#xD;
      FFR for detecting suboptimal stent result (SSR) in the acute phase and the stability of these&#xD;
      measurements over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After angiographically successful CTO PCI, intra-coronary physiologic assessment (RFR, FFR,&#xD;
      coronary flow reserve (CFR) and index of microcirculatory resistance (IMR)) of the CTO vessel&#xD;
      will be performed directly. A staged procedure including several measurements is planned at 4&#xD;
      ± 2 weeks after the index procedure. These measurements include same intra-coronary&#xD;
      physiologic measurements as performed at index procedure and optical coherence tomography&#xD;
      (OCT) imaging of the stented segment in the CTO target vessel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the staged procedure occurrence of cardiovascular events and clinical classification&#xD;
      will be assessed.&#xD;
