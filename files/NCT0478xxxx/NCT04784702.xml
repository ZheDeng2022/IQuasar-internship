      OBJECTIVES The goal of this study is to evaluate the self-achieved smoking cessation&#xD;
      supported with cytisine smoking cessation and its' on platelet aggregation and prothrombotic&#xD;
      state in patients after coronary angiography and PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND Cigarette smoking is a major risk factor of coronary artery disease (CAD). Smoking&#xD;
      cessation is one of the most cost-effective intervention in lifestyle. Self-reported rates of&#xD;
      smoking cessation are reasonably low. Cytisine is promising drug in support of smoking&#xD;
      cessation. Smoking affects various components leading to arterial thrombosis, and the effect&#xD;
      of smoking cessation on prothrombotic state and platelet aggregation is still under&#xD;
      investigation GOAL To assess rates of smoking cessation in patients after coronary&#xD;
      angiography and PCI and factors influencing success in smoking cessation To assess&#xD;
      feasibility, safety and efficacy of cytisine in smoking patients To assess effect of smoking&#xD;
      cessation on platelet aggregation in patients treated with clopidogrel and on prothrombotic&#xD;
      state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS A prospective nonrandomized observational study of patients after coronary&#xD;
      angiography.&#xD;
