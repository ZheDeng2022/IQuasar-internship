  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effects of daily consumption of 3 capsules of Swisse Nutra+ Cholesterol&#xD;
      Balance on serum LDL-cholesterol in adults with hypercholesterolaemia compared to placebo&#xD;
      over four months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Applicants will be eligible to participate if they have hypercholesterolemia, defined by&#xD;
      fasting LDL-cholesterol 2.5mmol/L and ≤5 mmol/L confirmed at screening visit. Participants&#xD;
      who are otherwise healthy will be included in the study; individuals with a history of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease are excluded from this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following pre-screening telephone assessment, applicants will attend an in-clinic screening&#xD;
      visit and following informed consent, their general health and eligibility for inclusion into&#xD;
      the study will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 eligible participants will be randomly allocated to receive one of two study&#xD;
      treatments (intervention or placebo). Participants will consume the assigned treatment daily&#xD;
      for four months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will return to the clinic at months 2 and 4 for assessment of primary and&#xD;
      secondary outcomes. Compliance, adverse events and concomitant medication use will be&#xD;
      assessed at these visits. In addition, participants will complete an online survey at months&#xD;
      1 and 3 to assess protocol compliance, adverse events and use of concomitant medications. Any&#xD;
      queries that arise from the survey will be followed up by phone call.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary intakes will be assessed at the baseline and four-month visits. A final participant&#xD;
      online survey and phone call (if needed) will be conducted one month after the 4-month visit&#xD;
      for a final safety assessment.&#xD;

    <description>Swisse Nutra+ Cholesterol Balance is a multi-ingredient nutraceutical composition contained in a brown soft-gel capsule format. Three capsules are required per dose.Swisse Nutra+ Cholesterol Balance is a multi-ingredient formulation containing artichoke extract, bergamot juice extract, hydroxytyrosol, an antioxidant derived from olive oil and sunflower oil-derived phytosterols. All ingredients target cholesterol reduction by different and complementing mechanisms, as evidenced by human clinical trials. These ingredients have been chosen to work synergistically to alleviate hypercholesterolemia and/or dyslipidemia through multiple pathways, whereby each ingredient works via a different mechanism to lower LDL-cholesterol in the body.</description>
