  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders are common problems in the society and involve the&#xD;
      masticator muscles, jaw joint and related structures. Since TMJ disorders affect functions&#xD;
      such as eating and speaking, they can cause important problems in the daily life of the&#xD;
      patient. Therefore, its diagnosis and treatment are of great importance. In the treatment of&#xD;
      these patients, methods such as analgesic and anti-inflammatory drugs, splint, exercise,&#xD;
      physical therapy modalities can be applied.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although the prevalence of TMJ disease detected in the community is between 40-60%, the rate&#xD;
      of symptoms or clinical findings was reported to be 87% in a study including 1040 people.&#xD;
      Incomplete clarification of the etiology and pathogenesis, the lack of standard diagnostic&#xD;
      and treatment approaches cause patients to learn to live with this problem, and severe pain&#xD;
      and limitation of movement cause a decrease in quality of life and loss of workforce.&#xD;
      Specific pathologies such as systemic inflammatory diseases, tumor, fracture, developmental&#xD;
      anomaly cause temporomandibular joint diseases. It also causes a wider group of non-specific&#xD;
      TMB originating from the musculoskeletal system.When the literature was reviewed, no&#xD;
      publications on the frequency of TMJ joint disease were found in medical faculty students.&#xD;

    <description>Demographic data, symptoms for TMJ of the students will be recorded. Physical examination will be included range of motion of temporomandibular joint, right and left TMJ lateral range of motion, whether there is a gradual opening, during deflection and deviation during the opening and subluxation for palpation and measurements. Opening and closing clicks, crepitation and popping will be recorded during palpation. Deep palpation of the skin, masseter and temporal muscles will be determined, posture analysis will be recorded and dental interventions, missing teeth, orthodontic treatments and bruxism histories will be taken. An appropriate diagnosis will be determined for students who are found to have pathology as a result of all these examinations and information about this diagnosis will be provided.</description>
