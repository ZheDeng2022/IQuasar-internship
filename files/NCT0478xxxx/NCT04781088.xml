  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II clinical trial studies the effect of lenvatinib, pembrolizumab, and paclitaxel&#xD;
      in treating patients with endometrial, epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary&#xD;
      peritoneal cancer that has come back (recurrent). While all 3 study drugs are FDA approved,&#xD;
      and 2-drug combinations have been studied, the 3- drug combination has not been studied yet.&#xD;
      The investigators believe that the addition of pembrolizumab to weekly paclitaxel and&#xD;
      lenvatinib (or weekly paclitaxel to pembrolizumab and lenvatinib) is highly effective and&#xD;
      safe with manageable side effects in both recurrent endometrial and platinum resistant&#xD;
      ovarian cancer. The purpose of this trial is to study how well lenvatinib, pembrolizumab, and&#xD;
      weekly paclitaxel work together in women who have recurrent endometrial cancer and/or&#xD;
      recurrent platinum resistant ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer, and what&#xD;
      kind of side effects patients may experience.&#xD;

      PRIAMRY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine objective antitumor activity (complete and partial response) of lenvatinib,&#xD;
      pembrolizumab, and weekly paclitaxel as measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid&#xD;
      Tumors (RECIST) criteria in recurrent endometrial and platinum resistant ovarian cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and tolerability weekly paclitaxel, lenvatinib, and pembrolizumab&#xD;
      in study patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To measure the progression free survival in the study population. III. To measure the&#xD;
      overall survival in the study population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To explore the baseline tumor genetic and microenvironment parameters predictive of&#xD;
      clinical benefit or resistance to the treatment combination and potential mechanisms of&#xD;
      resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beginning cycle 1 day 1, patients receive lenvatinib PO daily, pembrolizumab IV on day 1, and&#xD;
      paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15, on a 21 day cycle in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or has required active treatment&#xD;
             within the past 3 years. Note: Participants with basal cell carcinoma of the skin,&#xD;

             (note that the repeat imaging should be performed during study screening), clinically&#xD;

             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive&#xD;
             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a&#xD;
             form of systemic treatment&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination&#xD;
             antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic&#xD;
             interactions with pembrolizumab, lenvatinib and paclitaxel. In addition, these&#xD;
             patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with&#xD;
             marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients&#xD;

                  embolism (PE) has been clinically stable or improved on anticoagulation for &gt; 3&#xD;
                  months, patients are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with a history of clotting disorders must be excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant bleeding disorders within 6 months prior to administration of first dose&#xD;

             that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject's&#xD;
             participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of&#xD;
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive within the projected duration&#xD;
             of the study, starting with the screening visit through 120 days after the last dose&#xD;
             of trial treatment. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the potential&#xD;
             for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential&#xD;
             risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with&#xD;
             lenvatinib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated lenvatinib.&#xD;
             These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study&#xD;
