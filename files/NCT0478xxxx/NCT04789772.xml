  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Methamphetamine (MA) addiction has become a crucial public health issue due to its adverse&#xD;
      effects. Acupuncture has been used for drug detoxification for many years. However, some&#xD;
      disadvantages are not be suitable for MA users. The advantages of laser acupuncture includes&#xD;
      safety, painless, less time consuming and higher acceptability without current investigation.&#xD;
      Therefore, investigators arrange this study to evaluate the efficacy of laser acupuncture&#xD;
      combined with golden treatment of cognitive group therapy.&#xD;

      Methamphetamine (MA) addiction has become a crucial public health concern because of its&#xD;
      adverse consequences to individuals and the society. Manual or auricular acupuncture have&#xD;
      been applied in opioid dependence treatment for a long time. Electroacupuncture may also&#xD;
      alleviate the symptoms of MA addiction such as psychosis, anxiety, and depression during&#xD;
      abstinence. However, several comorbidities are associated with MA use, such as blood-borne&#xD;
      infections, decreased the willingness of physicians to perform. The advantages of laser&#xD;
      acupuncture (LA) include its safety, painlessness, limited time use, and higher&#xD;
      acceptability, making it suitable for treatment of drug users. To investigate the clinical&#xD;
      efficacy of laser acupuncture combined with group cognitive behavioral therapy for MA&#xD;
      addiction treatment. MA users who participated in group cognitive behavioral therapy and met&#xD;
      the inclusion criteria were referred from psychiatrists to participate. The participants&#xD;
      received laser acupuncture treatment once a week for 2 months (total eight treatments) on&#xD;
      selected acupoints (PC6, HT7, LI4, ST36, SP6, and LR3). Laboratory assessment included&#xD;
      urinalysis for MA and liver function tests aspartate aminotransferase, alanine&#xD;
      aminotransferase, and γ-glutamyltransferase (AST, ALT, and r-GT), whereas the objective&#xD;
      assessment included visual analog scale (VAS) for MA craving and refusal and Pittsburgh sleep&#xD;
      quality index (PSQI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)&#xD;
      questionnaires. All data were collected before and at 1 and 2 months after treatment.&#xD;
      Cognitive behavioral therapy completion rate and rate of relapse to MA use were also&#xD;
      determined.&#xD;
