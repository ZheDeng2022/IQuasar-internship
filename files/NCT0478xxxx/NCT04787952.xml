      The general purpose of the study was to provide new information about the role of&#xD;
      macronutrients intake, metabolomics, proteomics and microRNA on BAT activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The invesigator evaluated BAT activity and whole body energy consumption under cold&#xD;
      stimulation in two gruops of healthy males aged 21-43 years old with normal BMI ( 19-25kg/m2)&#xD;
      and in overweight/obese subjects.&#xD;

      In detail, the main objectives of this study was to measure the influence of biological&#xD;
      molecules of such fields: genomics, transcriptomics metabolomics and protemics and its&#xD;
      relationship on BAT activation. The investigator also evaluated the role of diet,&#xD;
      macronutirnets intake and polyunsaturated fatty acids on BAT activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. SCREENING VISIT:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  obtaining written informed consent from all subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  body composition analysis ( DXA + bioindepedance method inbody 720)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oral glucose tolerance test ( OGGT 75g)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Morphology&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CRP&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Creatinine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lipids profile&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TSH&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ALT,AST&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary analysis All subjects fulfilled a 3-day food diary. Subjects were asked to compare&#xD;
      the portion sizes with the colour photographs of each portion size, and to weigh food, if&#xD;
      possible. The daily total energy, macronutrients, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA),&#xD;
      polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), omega-3, and omega-6 fatty acids intake were analysed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2) STUDY VISITS: Patients who met the inclusion criteria and passed the screening stage were&#xD;
      invited for the first visit when PET / MRI after 2h of cold exposure was performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects were studied in the morning, from approximately 8 a.m. to 12 a.m., after an&#xD;
      overnight fast beginning at 10 p.m. the night before. At the beginning of the day on which&#xD;
      the PET study was performed, a catheter was inserted in the subject's antecubital vein for a&#xD;
      bolus injection of 18F-FDG. Another catheter was inserted in the antecubital vein of the&#xD;
      contralateral arm and was used to obtain samples of venous blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects rested in a supine position under thermoneutral conditions (22°C) for 1 hour and&#xD;
      then participants were exposed to cooling for 2 hours. The water perfused blankets were used&#xD;
      in the applied protocol of cooling. Blood samples were taken before as well as in 60th and&#xD;
      120th min of cooling. Subjects were cooled until shivering and then temperature is set&#xD;
      slightly (1-2°C) above the temperature that causes the onset of shivering. Shivering were&#xD;
      confirmed by visual inspection and by asking the subject each 15 min. After 2 hour the tracer&#xD;
      18F-FDG (4 MBq/kg ) was administered intravenously, and scanning was performed after the&#xD;
      injection of tracer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin temperatures were measured continually by means of electrode attached to skin below&#xD;
      armpit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the cold exposure, whole body resting energy expenditure (REE) was assessed by a&#xD;
      computed open-circuit indirect calorimetry method- based on the consumption of O2 and the&#xD;
      production of CO2. The 30 min long measurements of resting oxygen uptake and resting carbon&#xD;
      dioxide production were performed by a ventilated canopy Vmax Encore 29n System (Viasys&#xD;
      HealthCare, Yorba Linda, CA, USA) at the baseline ( -30 min to 0 min) and every 30 min until&#xD;
      120 min of cold exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During PET-MRI scanning blood samples were taken in 5', 10' 20' 30' 40' to check the activity&#xD;
      of 18-FDG. After PET/MRI patient's urine was collected and analyzed for activity of tracer.&#xD;
      Blood samples were taken for analysis before the cold exposure, at 60 min and 120 min during&#xD;
      the cold exposure to evaluate:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glucose, IL-6, Insulin, Free Fatty Acids (FFA), TSH, fT4,fT3, Irisin, Atrial natriuretic&#xD;
      peptide (ANP), Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), plasma nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA), DNA,&#xD;
      Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell (PBMC) for microRNA isolation, metabolomics and proteomics&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUMMARY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of our study is to search for new mechanisms that stimulate activation of BAT. It is&#xD;
      likely that individuals with different content and activity of the brown adipose will have&#xD;
      different set of serum markers after exposure to cold. This will allow the identification of&#xD;
      new biomarkers and to understand the molecular mechanisms responsible for the activation of&#xD;
      the brown adipose tissue. The outcomes will enable to find new potential therapeutic and&#xD;
      diagnostic applications given to the current obesity pandemic.&#xD;
