      Nausea and nomiting of Pregnancy (NVP) affects up to 80% of pregnant women . Severe NVP is&#xD;
      one of the most common indications for hospital admission among pregnant women, with typical&#xD;
      stays of between 3 and 4 days . Onset of NVP is in the first trimester. It typically starts&#xD;
      between the fourth and seventh weeks of gestation, peaks in approximately the ninth week and&#xD;
      resolves by the 20th week in 90% of women. If the initial onset is after 10+6 weeks of&#xD;
      gestation, other causes need to be considered There is a broad spectrum of nausea and&#xD;
      vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) severity, ranging from mild, occasional nausea to severe,&#xD;
      intractable vomiting requiring hospitalisation (hyperemesis gravidarum). Hyperemesis&#xD;
      gravidarum(HG) is defined severe, protracted nausea and vomiting associated with weight loss&#xD;
      of more than 5% of prepregnancy weight, dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. The exact&#xD;
      underlying pathophysiology is unknown, but etiology is believed to be multifactorial,&#xD;
      including endocrine, gastrointestinal and environmental factors.5 Risk factors include lower&#xD;
      maternal age, primigravidity, lower socioeconomic background and non-smoking status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Admission for hyperemesis gravidarum depends on clinical impression by the attending or&#xD;
      referring physician. There is a need for classification the severity of NVP to restrict&#xD;
      admission to those who need admission. An objective and validated index of nausea and&#xD;
      vomiting such as the Pregnancy-Unique Quantification of Emesis (PUQE) score may be used for&#xD;
      this purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This questionnaire contains three questions regarding the time-span of nausea, vomiting and&#xD;
      retching respectively, as well as one question assessing the global psychological and&#xD;
      physical quality of life (QOL). Initially the questionnaire evaluated symptoms during last 12&#xD;
      hours, but it has been modified to encompass 24 hours as well as the whole of first trimester&#xD;
      of pregnancy The PUQE questionnaire was used in several studies to assess the effect of&#xD;
      antiemetic treatments for emesis and hyperemesis . In this study, the role of PUQE in&#xD;
      evaluating need for inpatient admission will be studied. Also, the response to treatment&#xD;
      inside the hospital will be assessed&#xD;

    <description>We can assess severity and change by daily score which detected by daily PUQE score and pre gestational BMI by kg/m2 and BMI by kg/m2 of pregenent women with hyperemisis from day of admission to hospital to day of discharge To descripe the PUQE score full text with scoring range will be attached Total score is sum of replies to each of the three questions. PUQE-24 score: Mild â‰¤ 6; Moderate = 7-12; Severe = 13-15.&#xD;
