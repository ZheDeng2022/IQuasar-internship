    <textblock>
      Participants undergoing hand surgery will be assessed and compared for postoperative pain.&#xD;
      The patients' experience of going through surgery will be evaluated. The patient satisfaction&#xD;
      and patient assessed outcomes will be measured.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants undergoing hand surgery will be randomized into either a control group or one of&#xD;
      two groups that undergo mindfulness training during the perioperative period. One of the&#xD;
      treatment groups will be enrolled in the program &quot;Prepare for Surgery, Heal Faster&quot; provided&#xD;
      by NYU. The other treatment group will be enrolled in Wim Hof Method, a meditation program.&#xD;
      This program is not provided by NYU, but instructions will be provided to the patient on how&#xD;
      to complete the meditative exercises involved in this established method. Postop pain&#xD;
      medication and pain scores will be monitored.&#xD;

    <description>Pain will be measured by the visual analog scale (VAS) scale, The visual analog scale (VAS) is a validated, subjective measure for acute and chronic pain. Scores are recorded by making a handwritten mark on a 10-cm line that represents a continuum between &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;worst pain.&quot;</description>

    <measure>Change in Mindfulness Score of MAAS scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0, 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Mindfulness will be measured by the Mindful Attention Awareness (MAAS) Scale. The Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) is a 15-item self-report survey that measures the tendency to be fully aware of one's experience in the present moment without distraction or forgetfulness. Participants indicate whether they frequently or infrequently experience each item using a 6-point Likert scale: 1 (Almost Always), 2 (Very Frequently), 3 (Somewhat Frequently), 4 (Somewhat Infrequently), 5 (Very Infrequently), and 6 (Almost Never). The scale was developed with the understanding that people likely have better conscious access to information about their tendency to be mindless rather than mindful. As a result, the total score for the MAAS is computed by reverse-scoring and then summing all items</description>

    <description>Patients will be enrolled in Wim Hof Method, a breathing/meditation program. This is a free online program, developed by a man named Wim Hof and his techniques. On this website, he explains the origins and methods behind his teachings ( https://www.wimhofmethod.com/iceman-wim-hof. ). Patients in this group will take the online free course provided by the Wim Hof Method. The patients will be introduced to the online course preoperatively. The three pillars of the WHM are 1) breathing/meditation, 2) stretching exercises and 3) gradual cold exposure. The patients will be told to concentrate on the breathing and meditation component, they may not be able to participate in the cold exposure (cold showers, ice baths) in the immediate post op period because of the open wounds.</description>
