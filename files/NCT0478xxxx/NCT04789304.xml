  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this trial are to investigate safety and tolerability of BI 1595043&#xD;
      in healthy male subjects following administration of multiple rising doses over 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are the exploration of pharmacokinetics (PK) of BI 1595043 after single&#xD;
      and multiple dosing.&#xD;

             complete medical history including a physical examination, vital signs (blood pressure&#xD;
             (BP), pulse rate (PR), body temperature), 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), and&#xD;
             clinical laboratory tests&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age of 18 to 50 years (inclusive)&#xD;

          -  Repeated measurement of systolic blood pressure outside the range of 90 to 140&#xD;
             millimetre of mercury (mmHg), diastolic blood pressure outside the range of 50 to 90&#xD;
             mmHg, or pulse rate outside the range of 45 to 90 beats per minute (bpm)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any laboratory value outside the reference range that the investigator considers to be&#xD;
             of clinical relevance&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any evidence of a concomitant disease assessed as clinically relevant by the&#xD;
             investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic,&#xD;
             immunological or hormonal disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cholecystectomy or other surgery of the gastrointestinal tract that could interfere&#xD;
             with the pharmacokinetics of the trial medication (except appendectomy or simple&#xD;
             hernia repair)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diseases of the central nervous system (including but not limited to any kind of&#xD;
             seizures or stroke), and other relevant neurological or psychiatric disorders&#xD;
