  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The &quot;HEP score&quot; (HIT Expert Probability) is also a clinical probability score, created thanks&#xD;
      to the experience of clinicians (16). It is very recent and therefore still little studied&#xD;
      and little used. In particular, it has not been the subject of a prospective validation study&#xD;
      for ICU patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of this score is therefore not recommended in everyday practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the literature shows a higher diagnostic value of the HEP score especially for&#xD;
      resuscitation-type patients, as well as when used by an operator with little experience. This&#xD;
      could be due to greater detail given in consideration of other causes of thrombocytopenia&#xD;
      (17).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this work is to assess the intraoperator reproducibility in the&#xD;
      calculation of the HEP score in a population of intensive care patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives will aim to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate inter-operator reproducibility&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine if the reproducibility of the HEP score is influenced by:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient's sex The type of heparin used (LMWH vs UFH) The severity of the patient (IGS2&#xD;
      score) A history of cardiac or orthopedic surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected consistent benefits allow validation of the HEP score in surgical intensive care&#xD;
      (cf. EVHEP-TIH study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This would allow a better assessment of the pre-test probabilities of TIH with the&#xD;
      performance of biological tests.&#xD;

    <description>he retrospective cohort studied includes all the patients included in a previous study carried out in our center, the objective of which was to study the diagnostic performance of the HEP score in surgical intensive care.&#xD;
The cohort studied is made up of all patients admitted for surgical resuscitation between October 2011 and October 2013 and validating the following criteria:&#xD;
Inclusion criteria: any adult patient (age ≥ 18 years), admitted to surgical intensive care, treated with heparin (UFH or LMWH), and suspected of TIH by a clinician in the department according to the criteria of the SFAR 2002.&#xD;
Non-inclusion criteria: minor patients, pregnant women and adults incapable.</description>
