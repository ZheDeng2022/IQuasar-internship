  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial evaluates the tolerability of a physical activity program in head and&#xD;
      neck cancer patients who are undergoing cancer treatment. The goal of this trial is to give&#xD;
      patients exercises prescribed by a physical therapist that they are able to complete&#xD;
      regularly at home. Increasing physical activity may help patients reduce fatigue, improve&#xD;
      mood, increase physical performance, and decrease joint pain.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the changes in physical activity between the control and intervention groups of&#xD;
      patients with head and neck or lung cancer at 6-weeks and 12-weeks, compared to baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To demonstrate the feasibility, engagement, retention, and acceptability of physical&#xD;
      activity promotion (intervention) in patients with head and neck or lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To calculate the effect sizes for the differences between the control and intervention in&#xD;
      daily changes in psychosocial outcomes at 6-weeks and 12-weeks, compared to baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To calculate the effect sizes for the differences between the control and intervention in&#xD;
      changes in immunomodulatory, metabolic and aging biomarkers at 6-weeks and 12-weeks, compared&#xD;
      to baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Beginning 1 week prior to start of intervention, patients receive a Fitbit to monitor&#xD;
      physical activity for 13 weeks. Patients receive consultation and personalized exercise&#xD;
      prescription from a physical therapist at baseline, and attend exercise training sessions&#xD;
      with a physical therapist during weeks 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12. Patients also attend behavior&#xD;
      modification sessions with a behavioral therapist that focus on goal setting and healthy&#xD;
      behavior changes during weeks 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 11.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive a Fitbit to monitor physical activity for 12 weeks. Patients also&#xD;
      receive consultation from a physical therapist to assess physical performance at weeks 1, 6,&#xD;
      and 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study intervention, patients are followed up at 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To demonstrate the difference in the magnitude of physical activity improvements between&#xD;
      the immunotherapy and chemo-immunotherapy patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;

      prescription from a physical therapist at baseline, and attend exercise training sessions&#xD;
