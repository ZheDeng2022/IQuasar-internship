  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose administration&#xD;
      phase one clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and&#xD;
      preliminary pharmacodynamics of MT1013 injection in healthy subjects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single center, Phase 1, randomized, double-blind single-dose, sequential SAD&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This SAD study will consist of up to 5 cohorts (1 cohort per dose level). Each cohort will&#xD;
      include 8 subjects (6 subjects receiving the active study drug and 2 subjects receiving&#xD;
      matching placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A staggered dosing schedule will be used for each dose level administered under fasting&#xD;
      conditions. Two (2) sentinel subjects (1 active and 1 placebo) will be dosed first (a minimum&#xD;
      of 1 hour apart) and the remaining 6 subjects will be dosed no sooner than the next day (each&#xD;
      dosed at least 15 minutes apart).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following completion of each dose level, a SRC will review the safety and tolerability data&#xD;
      as well as the available PK data up to 48 hours in order to make decisions whether to&#xD;
      escalate to the next dose level, decrease the next dose level, repeat a dose level, or to not&#xD;
      evaluate any additional dose.&#xD;
