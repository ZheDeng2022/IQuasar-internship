  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metabolic reprogramming has been identified as a hallmark of cancer. Almost a century after&#xD;
      Otto Warburg initially discovered increased glycolytic activity in tumor tissue (&quot;Warburg&#xD;
      effect&quot;), therapeutic targeting of cancer metabolism has become a field of intense research&#xD;
      effort in cancer biology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A growing appreciation of metabolic heterogeneity and complexity is currently reshaping&#xD;
      investigators &quot;simplistic&quot; understanding of metabolic reprogramming in cancer. Discovering&#xD;
      metabolic vulnerabilities as new treatment targets for cancer requires systematic dissection&#xD;
      of metabolic dependencies, fuel preferences, and underlying mechanisms in the specific&#xD;
      physiological context. However, today's data on cancer cell metabolic signatures and&#xD;
      heterogeneity in their physiological habitat of the human organism is sparse to non-existent&#xD;
      representing a critical knowledge gap in designing effective metabolic therapies. Here, the&#xD;
      investigators propose a &quot;top-down&quot; approach studying cancer cell metabolism in patients&#xD;
      followed by mechanistic in-depth studies in cell culture and animal models to define&#xD;
      metabolic vulnerabilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will develop a metabolic tracing method to quantitatively characterize&#xD;
      metabolic signatures and fuel preferences of leukemic lymphocytes in patients with chronic&#xD;
      lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Isotopic metabolic tracers are nutrients that are chemically&#xD;
      identical to the native nutrient. Incorporated stable, non-radioactive isotopes allow&#xD;
      investigators to follow their metabolic fate by monitoring conversion of tracer nutrients&#xD;
      into downstream metabolites using cutting-edge metabolomics analysis. Using this method,&#xD;
      investigators propose to test the hypothesis that leukemic lymphocytes show tissue-specific&#xD;
      metabolic preferences that differ from non-leukemic lymphocytes and that ex vivo in-plasma&#xD;
      labeling represents a useful model for assaying metabolic activity in leukemic cells in a&#xD;
      patient-specific manner.&#xD;

    <description>Study team seek to develop a more cost-effective ex vivo model to assay metabolism under conditions closest to the physiological setting in a small amount of blood. In addition, this model will allow numerous pharmacologic interventions and may serve as a personalized ex vivo drug screening assay.&#xD;
Participants will be on overnight fasting. Cells and plasma will be separated from 5 ml of pre infused blood. Cell suspensions will be incubated at 37°C for 2hrs and intracellular and extracellular metabolites will be extracted separately for LCMS analysis.</description>
