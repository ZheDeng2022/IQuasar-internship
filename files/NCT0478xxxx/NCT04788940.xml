    <textblock>
      To date, advances in medical treatment and reperfusion therapy led to markedly decreased&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality rate in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI).&#xD;
      Nevertheless, there is a deterioration of left ventricular systolic function or development&#xD;
      of heart failure in 40-50% of surviving patients with AMI after the percutaneous coronary&#xD;
      intervention (PCI), and it is related to infarct size at the index procedure. Conventional&#xD;
      methods of measuring the infarct size included electrocardiogram, peak cardiac enzyme, and&#xD;
      echocardiography, but these do not indicate the exact irreversible tissue damage and only&#xD;
      suggest indirect parameters. However, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) provides&#xD;
      information on infarct size, microvascular obstruction, transmurality, and salvage index, and&#xD;
      discriminative function between viable and non-viable myocardium with high spatial&#xD;
      resolution. Also, magnetic resonance imaging is used as a gold standard for the evaluation of&#xD;
      the myocardial remodeling index. However, it is not well known in which patients occur&#xD;
      adverse remodeling for the myocardium and in which patients occur reverse remodeling.&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators sought to evaluate the clinical implication of CMR and to&#xD;
      determine factors affecting the 6-month remodeling index assessed by cardiac magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging through the current registry.&#xD;
