  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the effects of canakinumab in preventing lung cancer in patients&#xD;
      who have high-risk pulmonary nodules. Canakinumab is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere&#xD;
      with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving canakinumab may prevent the&#xD;
      development of lung cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine whether canakinumab increases regression rate of high-risk pulmonary nodules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine whether canakinumab prolongs lung cancer-free survival. II. To determine&#xD;
      whether canakinumab decreases the incidence of lung cancers. III. To assess the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of canakinumab in patients with high-risk indeterminate pulmonary nodules&#xD;
      (IPNs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess quality of life by patient reported outcomes in patients treated with&#xD;
      canakinumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To explore the radiographic (including radiomic features) evolution of high-risk IPNs with&#xD;
      treatment of canakinumab and to assess their association with risks of lung cancer as well as&#xD;
      their association with clinical benefit/toxicities in patients treated with canakinumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To explore the T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire evolution of patients with high-risk IPNs&#xD;
      and assess their association with risks of lung cancer as well as their association with&#xD;
      clinical benefit/toxicities in patients treated with canakinumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To explore the evolution of serum soluble factors, such as IFN-gamma and interferon&#xD;
      inducible factors (such as CXCL9 and CXCL10), IL-12, TNFalpha, IL-10, TGF-beta, VEGF, IL-6,&#xD;
      IL-8, IL-17, IL-18, C-reactive protein etc.) and assess their association with risks of lung&#xD;
      cancer as well as their association with clinical benefit/toxicities in patients treated with&#xD;
      canakinumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive canakinumab subcutaneously (SC) on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days&#xD;
      for up to 8 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 30 days and at 6, 12, and 24 weeks.&#xD;
