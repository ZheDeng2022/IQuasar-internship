      This study aims to determine whether gait training combined with motor imagery exercises has&#xD;
      a superior effect on the biomechanics of gait, functionality in activities of daily living,&#xD;
      motor capacity, and the perception of the quality of life in people. people with Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease, than gait training without motor imagery. To do this, a six-week training program&#xD;
      will be carried out, where walking exercises and motor imaging will be performed twice a week&#xD;
      in the experimental group, while only walking exercises will be performed in the control&#xD;
      group. Motor imagery exercises consist of performing a mental exercise by which an individual&#xD;
      rehearses or simulates a given action. Our hypothesis is that participants who perform motor&#xD;
      imagery exercises have better results than participants who train without imagery exercises.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motor imagery (MI) is a novel technique in neurorehabilitation. Current evidence supports the&#xD;
      ability of people diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (PD) to carry out this technique.&#xD;
      However, the trials that assess its effectiveness in this pathology are scarce. In some&#xD;
      physical rehabilitation programs, MI is introduced to conventional treatment or, MI can be&#xD;
      combined with observation of images or neurofeedback. At present, the effect of this&#xD;
      technique has been studied in highly heterogeneous variables, including both motor and&#xD;
      cognitive abilities or performance of activities of daily living. The evidence seems to&#xD;
      indicate that the introduction of MI to conventional treatment, with an adequate dose, may&#xD;
      induce greater benefits over people with PD in early stages (I-III on the Hoehn and Yahr&#xD;
      scale), especially in daily actions and movements functional such as gait, regardless of&#xD;
      medication. However, the small sample size of the trials and the use of non-validated scales&#xD;
      and non-objective tests, make it necessary that the results be viewed with caution. On the&#xD;
      other hand, the cost-benefit ratio of the therapy, its benefits and its easy application are&#xD;
      significant factors to take into account when adding MI to physiotherapy treatment in people&#xD;
      with PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General objective: To determine whether gait training combined with MI exercises has a&#xD;
      superior effect on the biomechanics of gait, functionality in activities of daily living,&#xD;
      motor capacity, and the perception of the quality of life in people with PD, which gait&#xD;
      training without MI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To study the validity of the instrumental technique available for the evaluation of gait&#xD;
           and the intra- and inter-rater reliability with the same tool in healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To check the effect, in the short and medium-term, of gait training program combined&#xD;
           with MI in people diagnosed with PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare the effects of the gait and MI training program with the effects obtained&#xD;
           through a gait rehabilitation program without MI exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To contrast the gait pattern of people with PD before and after undergoing a&#xD;
           rehabilitation program with MI, with that of healthy older people of the same age, sex,&#xD;
           and height.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To observe the differences in the biomechanics of gait between the hemibody most&#xD;
           affected by the signs of PD and the hemibody with less clinical alteration, before and&#xD;
           after performing a gait training program combined with MI exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation session will be carried out three times: before the treatment, at the end of&#xD;
      the intervention, and 3 months after the intervention has finished. In each evaluation&#xD;
      session, a clinical part and a biomechanical part will be carried out. The biomechanical&#xD;
      evaluation will be done using 7 inertial sensors in a 10-meter walk corridor. The inertial&#xD;
      sensor or inertial measurement unit (IMU) is made up of three different sensors: gyroscope,&#xD;
      accelerometer, and magnetometer, capable of collecting information on the turns, linear&#xD;
      acceleration, and magnetic north with respect to the earth's magnetic field. The part of the&#xD;
      clinical evaluation includes the evaluation of the functionality in the activities of daily&#xD;
      living, the motor capacity, and the perception of the quality of life through different&#xD;
      questionnaires and assessment scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the experimental and control groups of this study will perform an identical gait&#xD;
      physiotherapy program, however, motor imagery exercises will be included in the experimental&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gait exercises are aimed at improving specific gait characteristics, so they will&#xD;
      include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exercises for length stride : walk with visual cues on the ground to reach a certain&#xD;
           stride length, walk with horizontal poles at a height of 2 cm, walk over steps,&#xD;
           treadmill walk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exercises for Cadence training using a metronome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exercises for gait velocity training by combining the visual and auditory feedback&#xD;
           provided in previous exercises and on the treadmill&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exercises for the training of kinematic milestones during the stance and oscillation&#xD;
           phase of gait through the mobility of the ankle, knee, and hip joints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The motor imagery exercises within a session will be performed in a sitting position prior to&#xD;
      each gait exercise. The instructions will be administered through a voice recording. The&#xD;
      subject with closed eyes imagines himself performing the gait task while the general&#xD;
      guidelines that guide the cognitive process are given. The instructions describe how the&#xD;
      subject is from the starting position and the different body movements that he must pay&#xD;
      attention to during the imagining process. Through the instructions, the participant creates&#xD;
      an image of himself and perceives the kinesthesia while performing the exercise. The duration&#xD;
      of each motor imagery exercise is 8 minutes.&#xD;

Each rehabilitation session is composed of an initial 5 minutes of warm-up exercises (general mobility, coordination, strength, flexibility, balance, and breathing), followed by 45 minutes of gait training with motor imagery exercises and a final 10 minutes of muscle stretching.&#xD;
In the central 45 minutes of the session, exercises will be developed to improve objective characteristics of the gait-related to spatiotemporal and kinematic parameters. Objective and subjective feedback will be used for each exercise. In an interspersed way, motor imagery exercises will be carried out where participants must rehearse or simulate mentally each gait exercise that will be developed in the session.</description>
