  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adhesive capsulitis (frozen shoulder) is a condition of uncertain etiology characterized by&#xD;
      pain and progressive loss of both active and passive shoulder motion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shoulder pain and stiffness are accompanied by disability. It is thought that the incidence&#xD;
      is 3 to 5% in the general population. Laser therapy is widely used for treating different&#xD;
      musculoskeletal diseases, because of its ability to reduce pain and improve the physical&#xD;
      function. Also, MWM when used for shoulders with limited range of motion because of pain had&#xD;
      shown improvement in range of motion and pressure pain threshold. Previous studies have&#xD;
      investigated the efficacy of combining different manual technique with LLLT for treating pain&#xD;
      in some body parts. However, up till now the combined effect of MWM with LLLT for treatment&#xD;
      of patients with shoulder adhesive capsulitis have not been investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So, the present randomized controlled study will be conducted to investigate the effect of&#xD;
      adding mulligan mobilization with movement to low level laser therapy in treatment of&#xD;
      patients with shoulder adhesive capsulitis.&#xD;

    <description>Pain intensity will be measured with Visual Analog Scale (VAS). The patient will be asked to mark the severity of pain on a 100-mm line with &quot;no pain&quot; on one end and &quot;most unbearable pain&quot; on the other end</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>pain pressure threshold</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline at three weeks</time_frame>
    <description>- The most sensitive point will be located over the anterior aspect of the shoulder by manual palpation and will be marked with a permanent marker so that the same point could be used for pre- and post-condition application measures. This process will be repeated three times with a 30-s rest period between each measurement.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Shoulder range of motion (flexion, abduction, and external rotation)</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline at three weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A universal goniometer will be used to measure the ROM.&#xD;
patient in supine lying with shoulder neutral.&#xD;
Flexion ROM will be measured with the stationary arm of goniometer parallel to the trunk, and the moving arm parallel with the affected arm. Fulcrum will be placed in the point of lateral aspect of acromion process.&#xD;
For measurement of shoulder abduction, the fulcrum of the goniometer will be placed anterior to acromion process, stationary arm parallel to midline of sternum and movable arm will be placed at the midline of humerus. The patient is asked to abduct the arm as much as possible and the reading of the goniometer will be noted.&#xD;
For external rotation of the shoulder, patient is positioned in supine lying and arm abducted to 90 degree and elbow at 90 degree. Fulcrum of goniometry over olecranon and stationary arm perpendicular to floor, moving arm is aligned parallel to the ulna. The patient is asked to rotate externally as much as possible.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disability of Arm Shoulder Hand (DASH):</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline at three weeks</time_frame>
    <description>- The functional index designed to determine the symptoms and limitations that participant was experiencing while performing daily activities. This scale consists of 30 items in the form of activities of daily living with each item scoring from 0 to 4, where 0 is no difficulty in performing that activity and 4 is unable to do that activity. The DASH score is expressed as a percentage.</description>

    <description>for mulligan mobilization: for improving the limited range of motion of shoulder joint, the therapist will apply posterolateral mobilization for the shoulder joint. Three sets of painless glides of 10 repetitions will be applied with a rest interval of 30 s between each set.&#xD;
For low level laser application: Laser specifications is as follows: 850 nm wave length and pulsed application with 8 W applied for 20 minutes. laser will be applied over painful points of the shoulder.&#xD;
For traditional physical therapy exercises: the patients will receive the following exercise program: self stretching exercises for shoulder joint, pully exercises, back climbing exercises, finger ladder exercises, circumduction exercises and pendulum exercises</description>
