      ABSTRACT Object: The impact of morbidity and the deterioration in health-related quality of&#xD;
      life for patients with lymphedema after axillary lymph node dissection for breast cancer&#xD;
      justify the implementation of prevention programs to decrease the incidence of this chronic&#xD;
      condition. The aim was to compare the effectiveness of an experimental prevention program&#xD;
      with that of our conventional prevention program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Clinical randomized trial in two parallel groups over a two-year period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key words: lymphedema, breast cancer, prevention, rehabilitation&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a single-centre, open-label, controlled, randomized clinical trial. Patients were&#xD;
      recruited from the Breast Pathology Unit at Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau (HSCSP), a&#xD;
      tertiary referral hospital in Barcelona between March 2011 and April 2013. The inclusion&#xD;
      criteria were as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients between 18 and 85 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Having undergone a lymph node dissection as part of treatment for primary breast&#xD;
           neoplasm&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acceptance of the study conditions and signing of the informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria were:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  tumour recurrences&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  metastatic cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  open wounds or loss of skin integrity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  dependency or deterioration of higher functions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  arterial insufficiency and deep vein thrombosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  acute heart failure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  severe peripheral neuropathy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  lymphedema Patients included in the study were randomized to one of two groups. Group&#xD;
           1(G1) carried out the conventional prevention program consisting of an informative talk&#xD;
           and an exercise program. Group 2(G2) carried out the same program but with the addition&#xD;
           of a prophylactic compression garment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The program common to both groups consisted of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. An informative talk: Patients attended a one-hour long talk about lymphedema. The topics&#xD;
           covered were a description of the condition, the risks, and preventive measures to&#xD;
           include in their daily life. The recommended measures were those from the general&#xD;
           consensus of the International Lymphedema Society, the Spanish Rehabilitation Society&#xD;
           and The National Breast and Ovarian Cancer Center (J.González-Sánchez y Sánchez- Mata F&#xD;
           2010) (See tables 1 and 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. An exercise program. Seven days after lymph node removal, participants began this&#xD;
           program at the physiotherapy department. They attended two weekly sessions of 60 minutes&#xD;
           each. The sessions at the centre continued for 12 weeks. The program consisted of&#xD;
           aerobic exercise, in combination with resistance and stretching exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 (experimental) was also prescribed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • A flat knit compression garment (CG), class 1. Participants were recommended to wear this&#xD;
      CG for an average of 8 hours during the daytime for the first 3 months after surgery, and to&#xD;
      remove it at night. From the fourth month onwards, use of the garment was reduced to 2 hours&#xD;
      a day, coinciding with exercises and physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was evaluated and authorized by the Ethics Committee at Hospital de la Santa Creu i&#xD;
      Sant Pau (HSCSP), code IIBS-EPC-2011-87. All patients signed the written informed consent&#xD;
      form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluations All patients were evaluated at the start of the study, at the end of the exercise&#xD;
      prevention program, at 6 months, and at one and two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all the evaluations, we measured the volume of the upper extremities following the&#xD;
      lymphedema calculation formula based on the truncated cone, validated and published by the&#xD;
      Spanish Society of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (SERMEF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lymphedema was defined as a difference of more than 200 ml in volume between the upper&#xD;
      extremities, or as a difference of 10% in volume between the two upper limbs (SERMEF 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We recorded all the parameters of the history and general clinical examination, TNM stage,&#xD;
      performed treatments, number of resected nodes and complications. Compliance with all the&#xD;
      components of each program was monitored. Data regarding presence at the talk and at the&#xD;
      exercise program sessions at the centre were recorded by calendar. Home compliance was&#xD;
      monitored through personal interviews at 6 months, 1 year and 2 years.&#xD;
