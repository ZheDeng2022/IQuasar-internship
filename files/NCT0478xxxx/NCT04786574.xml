  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of tolvaptan on the need for&#xD;
      renal replacement therapy in pediatric subjects with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney&#xD;
      disease (ARPKD)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tolvaptan has been demonstrated to delay the decline of kidney function in adults with&#xD;
      rapidly progressing ADPKD (CKD stages 1 to 3), a closely related indication to ARPKD, as&#xD;
      measured by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and Total Kidney Volume (TKV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will be the first trial of tolvaptan in a pediatric ARPKD population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will be assigned to tolvaptan for 24 months and closely monitored&#xD;
      over the course of the study.&#xD;
