      This is a multicenter, Phase 3, open-label, safety, tolerability, and characterization of&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics study of the INL-001 (bupivacaine HCl) implant, at 300 mg, in patients&#xD;
      following various soft-tissue surgeries: open ventral hernia repair, abdominoplasty, open&#xD;
      abdominal hysterectomy, laparoscopic-assisted colectomy, and reduction mammoplasty. After a&#xD;
      screening period, eligible patients will undergo study surgery under general anesthesia and&#xD;
      have INL-001 implanted intraoperatively. Efficacy is also an exploratory measure in this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes a screening period, an inpatient period (preoperative, intraoperative,&#xD;
      postoperative) of approximately 5 days, and an outpatient follow-up period (up to 30 days&#xD;
      after treatment). Posttreatment safety and/or efficacy assessments will be made throughout&#xD;
      the study and as specifically scheduled through 96 hours posttreatment, on day 7 (telephone),&#xD;
      on day 15 (clinic visit), and on day 30 (clinic visit). Unless the investigator determines&#xD;
      further hospitalization is necessary, patients will be discharged approximately 96 hours&#xD;
      posttreatment (inpatient day 5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the screening period, all patients will undergo eligibility and other screening and&#xD;
      safety assessments. In addition, the investigator will administer the Pain Catastrophizing&#xD;
      Scale (screening only) as an exploratory measure and the 15-item Quality of Recovery (QoR-15)&#xD;
      questionnaire (baseline).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse event and concomitant medication information, including use of rescue pain&#xD;
      medication, will be collected throughout the study (inpatient and outpatient). Surgical wound&#xD;
      healing/grading assessments and assessment for signs and symptoms potentially indicative of&#xD;
      systemic bupivacaine toxicity will be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples for pharmacokinetic assessments will be collected from patients at multiple&#xD;
      time points for the measurement of concentrations of bupivacaine in plasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After surgery, patient reports of pain intensity using an 11-point numeric pain rating scale&#xD;
      (NPRS) will be recorded at multiple time points through 96 hours posttreatment. Patients will&#xD;
      be permitted rescue medication (oral and/or intravenous) to manage breakthrough pain when it&#xD;
      occurs. The QoR-15 questionnaire and Patient Global Assessment (for pain control) will be&#xD;
      administered on an inpatient basis and on day 7. The Opioid Related Symptom Distress Scale&#xD;
      will be administered on an inpatient basis.&#xD;

    <description>Time-weighted sum of pain intensity from Time 0 through 24 hours (SPI24). Lower score has a better outcome. Pain Intensity was assessed by the subject using the 11-point NRS, where 0 indicated &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 indicated &quot;worst pain possible&quot;. Minimum value would be &quot;0&quot; and Maximum value would be 240. Time-weighted SPI is calculated as the sum of the pain intensities between successive time points (i.e., if SPI24 = ∑[PI x (time t - time t-1)], where &quot;t&quot; represents a given time point,&quot;t-1&quot; represents the previous time point, and time is expressed in hours). This represents the AUC (Area Under the Curve) of the pain intensities when calculated with the trapezoidal rule.</description>
