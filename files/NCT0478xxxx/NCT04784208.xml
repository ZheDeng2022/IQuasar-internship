      Type of Study Questionnaire- Development and validation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information about the Q'SHY:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Q'SHY- Questionnaire for Screening of Hypothyroidism is a Patient Reported Outcome&#xD;
           (PRO) tool to enable screening for Hypothyroidism in the general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is a 20-item questionnaire which covers aspects of the symptoms of Hypothyroidism and&#xD;
           incorporates the contributory factors from patient history which when combined, provides&#xD;
           a robust tool to effectively screen the population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The questionnaire content is being created based on a thorough search for relevant&#xD;
           literature and encompasses all important aspects for screening purposes&#xD;

      Objectives The objectives of the study are as described in the below points.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To develop a questionnaire (Q'SHY) for the identification and screening of subjects with&#xD;
           suspected hypothyroidism.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the validity of the designed questionnaire by comparing the outcomes of the&#xD;
           responses between General population subjects and treatment naïve subjects group with&#xD;
           hypothyroidism.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The study aims to establish a valid questionnaire with a robust sensitivity and&#xD;
           specificity to detect signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria for Subjects The criteria based on which, subjects in each Arm will be&#xD;
      chosen to take part in the survey. Arm1: Subjects from the general population who are naïve&#xD;

        -  Male and female subjects between the ages 18 years and 65 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects who had symptoms of hypothyroidism were seen by a physician and diagnosed with&#xD;

      their hypothyroid status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals less than 18 years of age and more than 65 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      The above-mentioned criteria will be applicable to both Face validation and Pilot survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Subjects are divided into 2 arms, with 100 subjects in each arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Phase -1&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Arm 1: Sixteen subjects from the general population who are naïve to their&#xD;
                hypothyroid status with equal distribution of males and females.&#xD;
&#xD;

                treatment naïve with equal distribution of males and females&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Phase -2&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Arm 1: One hundred subjects from the general population who are naïve to their&#xD;
