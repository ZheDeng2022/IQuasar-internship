  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity can be defined as' a disease that occurs as a result of the energy (calorie) taken&#xD;
      with food being more than the energy consumed and the excess energy being stored as fat in&#xD;
      the body, negatively affecting the quality and duration of life. BMI is calculated by&#xD;
      dividing the weight (kg) by the square of the height (m2) (1,2). According to the World&#xD;
      Health Organization (WHO) classification, BMI between 25-29.9 kg / m2 is overweight, 30-34.9&#xD;
      kg / m2 is light, 35-39.9 kg / m2 is medium, 40 kg / m2 and above is considered as severe&#xD;
      obesity. Obesity has important effects on respiratory function. These mechanical and&#xD;
      biochemical effects are not easily measured by pulmonary function test and BMI&#xD;
      measurement.Changes caused by mediators produced by adipose tissue likely cause changes in&#xD;
      lung function, but this effect is not fully understood at the moment. The aim of our study is&#xD;
      to make these effects more understandable and to compare them with different obesity classes&#xD;
      and people with normal weight who are considered healthy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 0: The effects of obesity on respiratory functions and multidimensional&#xD;
      health-related parameters do not show a statistically significant difference compared to&#xD;
      individuals with different levels of the disease and normal weight individuals classified as&#xD;
      healthy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: The effects of obesity on respiratory functions and multidimensional&#xD;
      health-related parameters show a statistically significant difference compared to people with&#xD;
      different levels of the disease and normal weight individuals classified as healthy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be carried out by face-to-face evaluations in a clinical setting with obese&#xD;
      patients between the ages of 18-65 who have applied to the clinic with a diagnosis of obesity&#xD;
      and agree to participate in the study, and healthy volunteers who are considered to be&#xD;
      healthy without a diagnosis of obesity. Looking at the evaluations to be made; Measurement of&#xD;
      respiratory function parameters, measurement of respiratory muscle strength, anthropometric&#xD;
      measurements, evaluation of body composition, quality of life, upper extremity muscle&#xD;
      strength and grip strength, lower extremity muscle strength, fatigue evaluation, vital signs,&#xD;
      evaluation of exercise perception, presence of dyspnea and its level will be evaluated. A&#xD;
      detailed description of these evaluations and the parameters to be used will be explained in&#xD;
      detail in the next step.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Obesity can be defined as' a disease that occurs as a result of the energy (calorie) taken&#xD;
      with food being more than the energy consumed and the excess energy being stored as fat in&#xD;
      the body, negatively affecting the quality and duration of life. A body mass index (BMI) of&#xD;
      30 or above in adults is classified as obese. BMI is calculated by dividing the weight (kg)&#xD;
      by the square of the height (m2). According to the World Health Organization (WHO)&#xD;
      classification, BMI between 25-29. 9 kg / m2 is overweight, 30-34. 9 kg / m2 is light, 35-39.&#xD;
      9 kg / m2 is medium, 40 kg / m2 and above is considered as severe obesity. As the increases&#xD;
      in BMI are related to the number of comorbidities, weight loss also affects many risk&#xD;
      factors. It has been shown that voluntary weight loss in obese individuals over short periods&#xD;
      (weeks or months) reduces risk factors and improves disease symptoms associated with obesity,&#xD;
      including heart disease, Type II Diabetes mellitus, and osteoarthritis. Obesity; It is an&#xD;
      important risk factor and disease factor for asthma, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome,&#xD;
      obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) and pulmonary hypertension diseases. The overall&#xD;
      effect of obesity on lung function is multifactorial and is related to the mechanical and&#xD;
      inflammatory aspects of obesity. Obesity has important effects on respiratory function. These&#xD;
      mechanical and biochemical effects are not easily measured by pulmonary function test and BMI&#xD;
      measurement. Changes caused by mediators produced by adipose tissue likely cause changes in&#xD;
      lung function, but this effect is not fully understood at the moment.As a result of the&#xD;
      literature review the investigators conducted, it was observed that the studies conducted in&#xD;
      order to make more understandable the physiological and mechanical effects of obesity on&#xD;
      different systems in the body, especially the respiratory system, were limited and inadequate&#xD;
      in terms of numerical and targeted purposes. It was observed that lower extremity muscle&#xD;
      strength, fatigue, sleep quality parameters were not included, and their relations with&#xD;
      respiratory system functions and measurements were not measured. The aim of our study is to&#xD;
      make these effects more understandable and to compare them with different obesity classes and&#xD;
      people with normal weight who are considered healthy. Individuals who volunteered to&#xD;
      participate in the study, who met the inclusion criteria and volunteered to participate will&#xD;
      be evaluated by dividing them into five different groups according to the BMI parameter, in&#xD;
      accordance with the intervals determined by WHO, and the data obtained will be compared&#xD;
      between the groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurement of Pulmonary Function Parameters: The respiratory function parameters of the&#xD;
           participants will be measured with a respiratory function test using a spirometer. With&#xD;
           these tests, the static and dynamic lung volumes and functional status of the person&#xD;
           will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurement of Respiratory Muscle Strength:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It consists of respiratory muscles, diaphragm, intercostal (internal and external), scalene,&#xD;
      sternocleidomastoid, triangularis sterni, abdominal, shoulder and neck muscles. Respiratory&#xD;
      muscle strength can be measured in many different ways. Among the pulmonary function tests,&#xD;
      maximum inspiratory and expiratory pressures are the measurements that are frequently used to&#xD;
      evaluate the strength of the respiratory muscles. -Measurement of Respiratory Muscle&#xD;
      Strength:It consists of respiratory muscles, diaphragm, intercostal (internal and external),&#xD;
      scalene, sternocleidomastoid, triangularis sterni, abdominal, shoulder and neck muscles.&#xD;
      Respiratory muscle strength can be measured in many different ways. Among the pulmonary&#xD;
      function tests, maximum inspiratory and expiratory pressures are the measurements that are&#xD;
      frequently used to evaluate the strength of the respiratory muscles. These measurements are&#xD;
      directly related to respiratory muscle strength and help to determine the rehabilitation and&#xD;
      exercise program by providing information about the patient's condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Anthropometric Measurements: Participants' waist circumference, hip circumference, neck&#xD;
      circumference will be measured, and their ratios (waist / height ratio, waist / hip ratio)&#xD;
      will be calculated. Body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio (B /&#xD;
      C) is the diagnostic methods commonly used to detect adiposity. Waist circumference and&#xD;
      waist-hip ratio have been found to be useful measurements for measuring visceral fat&#xD;
      accumulation. Measurement of neck circumference is used as an anthropometric marker to&#xD;
      identify patients at risk for sleep apnea syndrome. At the same time, neck circumference is&#xD;
      thought to be associated with other metabolic diseases. In addition to these measurements,&#xD;
      the measurement called 'New BMI' used in the literature will also be made. In this&#xD;
      measurement, BMI is calculated with the formula 1.3 Ã— (kg / m2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to calculate the body fat ratio, it is aimed to estimate the amount of body fat with&#xD;
      the measurement of Clinica Universidad de Navarra-Body Adiposity Estimator (CUN-BAE) in&#xD;
      addition to the bioelectric impedance method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BMI measurement is insufficient to determine body fat and muscle ratio. Since it is difficult&#xD;
      to determine the location of the fat tissue in the body, it will be evaluated with the ''&#xD;
      Body Shape Index ''.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Assessment of Body Composition: Body composition will be measured using the method called&#xD;
      bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). This measurement is based on the principles of&#xD;
      electrical conductivity of body tissues. It is a fast, practical and relatively inexpensive&#xD;
      method compared to other similar devices and applications used to examine the body&#xD;
      composition of individuals. This method shows the percentage and mass of body fat, lean body&#xD;
      weight and the amount of water in the body and their distribution percentage. The person&#xD;
      climbs on the device and places his or her hands in the designated places. Electric current&#xD;
      travels through the body and provides information about parameters determined by certain&#xD;
      algorithms and calculations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Quality of Life: Quality of life is accepted as a multidimensional structure with many&#xD;
      different contents. Considering the decrease in physical capacity, pain, deterioration in&#xD;
      interpersonal relationships, decreased self-esteem, loss of self-esteem, depression, social&#xD;
      stigma, difficulty in finding a job, rejection by the school and business environment, it is&#xD;
      understood how low the health-related quality of life of obese individuals is. In measuring&#xD;
      the quality of life; Nottingham Health Profile questionnaire will be used. Nottingham Health&#xD;
      Profile is a questionnaire consisting of 7 subtitles and 45 questions, including physical,&#xD;
      social and psychological evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Upper Extremity Muscle Strength and Gripping Strength: It is an important parameter related&#xD;
      to muscle strength, functional capacity, cardiovascular disease risk factors and mortality.&#xD;
      Upper extremity muscle strength and grip strength will be measured by hand dynamometer and&#xD;
      weight lifting tests (arm curls test).&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Lower Extremity Muscle Strength: Abnormalities that usually occur in lower extremity muscles&#xD;
      affect patients' physical performance and daily living activities, reduce exercise tolerance&#xD;
      and impair health-related quality of life. 30-second sit-and-go test will be used to measure&#xD;
      lower extremity muscle strength. The score is determined by the number of times the&#xD;
      participant sits and stands up for 30 seconds from the moment the participant is commanded to&#xD;
      place his hands on the crossed, shoulders in the chair he is sitting with his back supported&#xD;
      and to start in the position where his feet are in full contact with the floor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fatigue Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fatigue is a common complaint in overweight and obese people. It has been stated that this is&#xD;
      caused by increased body mass, decreased physical activity level and sleep disorders. In the&#xD;
      assessment of fatigue, the Fatigue Severity Scale (39) will be used. The fatigue severity&#xD;
      scale consists of 9 questions that question social relationship, physical performance and&#xD;
      symptomatically the severity of fatigue. The total score is created according to the answers&#xD;
      given to the questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Vital Sign: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypertension (HT), dyslipidemia (DLP),&#xD;
      obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) comorbidities have been associated with morbid&#xD;
      obesity in obese individuals. Blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation will be evaluated&#xD;
      in order to observe the negative effects of these comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Evaluation of Exercise Perception: Aerobic exercise capacity is an essential component of&#xD;
      physical fitness. Perceived benefits and perceived barriers to participating in physical&#xD;
      activity will be assessed by Exercise Benefits / Barriers Scale (EBBS). It is a questionnaire&#xD;
      consisting of 43 questions used to evaluate people's perception of exercise. Evaluates the&#xD;
      ideas of being useful and preventive that exercise creates on people. The test score is&#xD;
      determined by the score collected according to the answers given to the questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Assessment of the Presence and Level of Dyspnea: According to the American Thoracic Society&#xD;
      (ATS) report, the definition of dyspnea was defined as &quot;unpleasant or uncomfortable breathing&#xD;
      sensation and personal respiratory disturbance caused by various intensity senses&quot; and it was&#xD;
      stated to be a subjective feeling. &quot;Modified Medical Research Council Scale (MMRC)&quot; will be&#xD;
      used to evaluate the presence of dyspnea. The MMRC is a five-item scale created on the basis&#xD;
      of various activities that cause shortness of breath. The presence and effect of dyspnea&#xD;
      occur according to the substance chosen by the person.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Statistical method (s) to use: '' Hatem AM, Ismail MS, El-Hinnawy YH. 'Effect of different&#xD;
      classes of obesity on the pulmonary functions among adult Egyptians: a cross-sectional&#xD;
      study', Egypt J Bronchol 2019; 13: 510-5 '', the total number of samples determined for 5&#xD;
      groups in the sample size study, based on the FVC value and standard deviations in table 2,&#xD;
      was calculated as 80 on the condition that it was 16 per group. Sample size calculation was&#xD;
      made using the NCSS / PASS program. In the calculation, it was determined that the difference&#xD;
      between the averages of the 5 groups should be 80% power and 95% confidence level to be&#xD;
      significant. The statistical test method to be applied ANOVA will be used in conditions of&#xD;
      normal distribution between groups, and Kruskal-Wallis test method will be used if the&#xD;
      condition of normal distribution between groups cannot be achieved.&#xD;
