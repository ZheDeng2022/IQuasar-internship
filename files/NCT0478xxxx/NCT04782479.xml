  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators compared the tube movement between two situations; the one was that the&#xD;
      practitioner's hand holding the tracheal tube was placed in the air, and the other was that&#xD;
      the hand was placed on the manikin's cheek, while two residents took the roles of the&#xD;
      practitioner and the assistant in tracheal intubation with a stylet for a manikin.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Residents who accepted spontaneous participation were randomly combined into teams of two&#xD;
      each. For two residents in a team, each sequentially took on the role of a practitioner and&#xD;
      once as an assistant for tracheal intubations by changing the position of the hand holding&#xD;
      the tube; one time, the position of the hand holding the tube was placed in the air, and the&#xD;
      other time, the position of the hand holding the tube was placed on the cheek of the manikin.&#xD;
      For the assistant role, residents performed stylet removal with two hands. Investigators&#xD;
      filmed a video of the tube movement while the assistant pulling up the stylet at 1/8x speed.&#xD;
      While analyzing the captured videos, it was measured how much the tube held by the intubation&#xD;
      practitioner went in front or how far back during the process of pulling the stylet.&#xD;
