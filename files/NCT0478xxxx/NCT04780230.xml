  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study aims to determine if transcranial direct current stimulation can enhance&#xD;
      the effect of speech therapy in post-stroke patients with dysarthria.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 60 Cantonese-speaking post-stroke patients who are suffering from dysarthria will&#xD;
      be recruited and randomly divided into real tDCS and sham groups. All the participants will&#xD;
      receive individualized speech therapy based on the results of their speech assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the real tDCS group, an anodal high-definition tDCS of 2 milliamperes (mA) lasting for 20&#xD;
      minutes will be delivered to the orofacial area of the primary motor cortex (SM1) during&#xD;
      speech therapy. For the sham tDCS group, stimulation given during speech therapy will only&#xD;
      last for 30 seconds in order to cause a similar sensation on the scalp as the real&#xD;
      stimulation group. There will be a total of 10 daily sessions during a 2-week period.&#xD;
