  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is being done to help determine the safety and efficacy of gadolinium&#xD;
      based nanoparticle, Activation and Guidance of Irradiation X (AGuIX), used in conjunction&#xD;
      with MR-guided stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in the treatment of pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer and lung tumors.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a seamless phase I/II trial with two separate disease groups/cohorts (centrally&#xD;
      located lung tumors and locally advanced/unresectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma-LAPC).&#xD;
      The Phase I part is determining for each disease group a safe dose-level that will be&#xD;
      evaluated in the Phase II component of the study. The phase II part of the study is a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial that tests, for each disease group, the treatment efficacy of&#xD;
      stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in combination with AGuIX gadolinium-chelated&#xD;
      polysiloxane based nanoparticles compared to treatment with stereotactic magnetic resonance&#xD;
      (MR)-guided adaptive radiation therapy (SMART) alone&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved Activation and Guidance of&#xD;
      Irradiation X (AGuIX) as a treatment for any disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AGuIX is a gadolinium-based nanoparticle, gadolinium is the drug used for an MR with&#xD;
      contrast. It is believed that the AGuIX may help the radiation received work better by making&#xD;
      a tumor more sensitive to the radiation and allowing doctors to see the tumor more clearly.&#xD;
      AGuIX has been tested in one previous study with humans. It was found that AGuIX did make&#xD;
      tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including&#xD;
      evaluations and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive study treatment for 5 treatment days and will be followed for a&#xD;
      year after your treatment ends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 100 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;

        pancreatic head, body or tail.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have measurable disease, defined as a lesion that can be accurately&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and follow the breathing instructions involved in the&#xD;
             respiratory gating procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  platelets ≥100,000/mcL&#xD;

             institutional normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of AGuIX on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, as&#xD;
             well as the known teratogenic effects of radiation, women of child-bearing potential&#xD;
             and men must agree to use adequate contraception prior to study entry and for the&#xD;
             duration of study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have had prior radiation therapy to the chest or abdomen that would&#xD;
             overlap with the current treatment field.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with known metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to gadolinium-based IV contrast.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because AGuIX is contrast agent with the&#xD;
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but&#xD;
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with AGuIX, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with&#xD;
             AGuIX.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe claustrophobia or anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known HIV-positive participants on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible&#xD;
             because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with AGuIX. In addition,&#xD;
             these participants are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with&#xD;
             marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in participants&#xD;
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active duodenal or gastric ulcer disease or evidence of tumor invasion of the bowel or&#xD;
             stomach based on endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of a duodenal stent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unable to undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) due to any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Presence of MRI-incompatible metal material or devices in the human body&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. MRI-incompatible Pacemaker or defibrillator&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Insulin pump&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Aneurysm clip&#xD;
