    <textblock>
      This will be a single-centre, open label trial to determine the safety and feasibility of&#xD;
      CHMI model using Plasmodium falciparum-infected cryopreserved erythrocytes administered to&#xD;
      healthy Tanzanian adults with varying prior exposure to P. falciparum.&#xD;

      This study will be a single-centre controlled human malaria infection study using adults with&#xD;
      varying degrees of prior exposure to P. falciparum. The study will take place at Bagamoyo&#xD;
      Clinical Trail Facility of the Ifakara Health Institute, located in Bagamoyo town (about 60&#xD;
      km north of Dar es Salaam).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twelve healthy male adults aged 18 to 35 years will be recruited into two cohorts of high and&#xD;
      low previous exposure consisting of 6 volunteers each as determined by anti-schizont antibody&#xD;
      levels. Up to 5 back-up volunteers will be also be recruited and may take the place of&#xD;
      another volunteer should they withdraw or become ineligible prior to challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be infected via IV administration of Plasmodium falciparum-infected human&#xD;
      erythrocytes of the chloroquine-susceptible 3D7 strain. Participants will then be closely&#xD;
      monitored in a clinical trial facility for a maximum of 31 (28 days plus 3 days of treatment&#xD;
      with anti-malarial drugs) days while undergoing frequent clinical and laboratory assessment.&#xD;
      Volunteers who do not reach malaria treatment criteria as per protocol at day 28 (C+28) will&#xD;
      be treated presumptively with antimalarial medications (ALU + a single low dose primaquine)&#xD;
      under direct observation and will be discharged upon completion of treatment and on&#xD;
      discretion of the study clinician.&#xD;
