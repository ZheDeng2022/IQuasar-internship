  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is associated with a variety of co-morbidities. Children with obesity are more likely&#xD;
      to have risk factors associated with cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and CVD risk markers (e.g.&#xD;
      hypertension, elevated serum cholesterol, and type 2 diabetes mellitus), but also with organ&#xD;
      specific pathologies such as a non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). A recent&#xD;
      meta-analysis has shown that the prevalence of NAFLD in obese pediatric populations is&#xD;
      approximately 35%, compared to approximately 8% in general pediatric population, making it a&#xD;
      very important health threat in these populations. Successful pharmacological interventions&#xD;
      to treat or prevent NASH are not yet available and so far only weight loss has clear&#xD;
      benefits. However, it is well known that sustained weight-loss is difficult to achieve on the&#xD;
      longer-term. The investigators recently demonstrated in mice that plant sterol and stanol&#xD;
      ester consumption inhibited the development of liver inflammation. Moreover, Javanmardi et&#xD;
      al. recently demonstrated in a population of adult NAFLD patients, that plasma concentrations&#xD;
      of Alanine Transaminase (ALT) were reduced after daily plant sterol consumption (1.6 g/d) for&#xD;
      6 weeks. In this study, the investigators propose to evaluate the effect of consuming soft&#xD;
      chews enriched with plant stanol esters (3 grams/day) on ALT concentrations in children with&#xD;
      overweight or (morbid) obesity who are at risk of developing NAFLD, in a randomized,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, double blinded study with an intervention period and follow-up period of&#xD;
      6 months. 52 overweight and obese children with elevated ALT concentrations (&gt;39 U/L for boys&#xD;
      and &gt;33 U/L for girls) will be included. All children will be randomly allocated to consume&#xD;
      control or plant stanol ester enriched soft chews on a daily basis for a period of 6 months.&#xD;
      After 12 months there will be an additional blood sample to evaluate whether the 6 months&#xD;
      intervention is still effective.&#xD;

    <description>Plasma ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase) concentration is a laboratory parameter, measured in blood, reflecting possible presence of NAFLD. Concentrations below 26 U/L for boys, and below 22 U/L for girls, are considered normal. Concentrations above 39 U/L for boys, and above 33 U/L are considered to reflect presence of NAFLD.</description>

    <description>HRI is measured during a conventional ultrasound of the liver, in which three close-up images of the liver and right kidney are made by a physician-researcher. HRI is calculated from these images by a pediatric radiologist, as the ratio of the hepatic brightness and the renal brightness (HRI = echogenicity of the liver/echogenicity of the kidney). The average of the three images is taken as the definite HRI, as a reflection of hepatic fat content.</description>
