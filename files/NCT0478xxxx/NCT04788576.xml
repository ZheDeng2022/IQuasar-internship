  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the incidence of coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD) and its' prognostic&#xD;
      implication in patients who have diagnosed as heart failure with preserved ejection fraction&#xD;
      (HFpEF) confirmed by HFA-PEFF scoring system without functionally significant coronary artery&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a clinical syndrome in patients&#xD;
      with current or prior symptoms of HF with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 50&#xD;
      percent and evidence of cardiac dysfunction as a cause of symptoms (abnormal LV filling and&#xD;
      elevated filling pressures). Previous studies have reported that HFpEF is related to various&#xD;
      clinical risk factors such as hypertension, obesity, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney&#xD;
      disease, atrial fibrillation, myocardial ischemia with or without significant epicardial&#xD;
      coronary artery stenosis, or myocardial infiltrative disease. Although its pathophysiology&#xD;
      remains incompletely understood, findings from clinical and pre-clinical studies have&#xD;
      suggested systemic endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and coronary microvascular&#xD;
      dysfunction (CMD) could be important pathophysiologic mechanisms for HFpEF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this regard, recent studies evaluated non-invasively measured coronary flow reserve (CFR)&#xD;
      from positron emission tomography (PET), cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or Doppler&#xD;
      echocardiography, and presented the association of depressed global CFR with cardiac&#xD;
      diastolic dysfunction and higher risk of clinical events. The presence of CMD can be also&#xD;
      evaluated by invasive physiologic assessment using both CFR and index of microcirculatory&#xD;
      resistance (IMR). Nevertheless, there has been limited study which evaluated the association&#xD;
      between HFpEF and CMD using invasive physiologic indices and their prognostic implications,&#xD;
      especially in patients without significant coronary artery stenosis. Therefore, we sought to&#xD;
      evaluate the incidence of CMD and its' prognostic implication in patients who have diagnosed&#xD;
      as heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) confirmed by HFA-PEFF scoring&#xD;
      system without functionally significant coronary artery disease.&#xD;
