  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dopaminergic drugs partially alleviate gait problems in Parkinson's disease, but the effects&#xD;
      are not sustained in the long-term. Particularly, the freezing of gait, balance problems and&#xD;
      other gait issues directly impacts patients' quality of life. Experimental epidural spinal&#xD;
      cord stimulation studies have suggested positive effects on locomotion among PD patients, but&#xD;
      the effects of non invasive stimulation have never been explored.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel, phase II&#xD;
      clinical trial that will assess the efficacy and safety of transcutaneous magnetic spinal&#xD;
      cord stimulation in PD patients who have gait and balance changes refractory to dopaminergic&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;

    <masking_description>The random sequence will be generated by a computer program (randomization.com) using randomly exchanged blocks (size of four per block, active ratio / placebo 1: 1). Randomization will be stratified according to the severity of symptoms (TUG&gt; 33 seconds = severe group; TUG ≤ 33 seconds = light group). The researchers will be specifically instructed not to break the randomization schedule in any way. Different researchers will carry out randomization, clinical evaluation and stimulation. Patients will be blinded to randomization.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>TUG</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-stimulation: immediately after the fifth day of stimulation, seven days after the stimulation, twenty-eight days after stimulation.</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome will be the change in gait speed between pre-stimulation and post-stimulation conditions between the two groups (active and placebo) assessed using the 5-meter total Timed Up and Go Test (TUG). Mixel model ANOVA, with TUG as the dependent variable, and time and group as independent variables -'group' would have two levels ('active' and 'placebo'). Our alternative hypothesis is that 'the time vs. group' interaction effect is significant. Then we should use post hoc statistical tests to explore our data further and to compare the effects of active versus placebo at different time levels.</description>

    <description>In the active group, non-invasive transcutaneous magnetic stimulation of the dorsal spine will be applied by placing a circular magnetic coil (Magventure®️ MagPro®️ R20) on the skin, in the upper thoracic region (chest level T2-T3). The stimulation intensity will represent 100% of the motor threshold, this determined by abdominal muscle contractions, found from single pulses, applied gradually every 10 seconds until the contractions appear. The intermittent theta burst stimulation protocol will consist of 20 stimulation trains, with an interval of 8 seconds between trains, each train will have 20 bursts, and each burst will have 3 pulses at 50 Hz repeated at 5 Hz. In total, 1200 pulses will be applied for 3 minutes and 58 seconds.</description>

    <description>In the placebo group, a coil will be allocated in the T2-T3 thoracic region, however this coil will not be connected to the stimulation device, and another active coil will be positioned about 15cm behind, far from its field of view, to provide idea from the sound stimulus that is being stimulated. To create a sensation of muscle contraction and impression of active stimulation, both the placebo and active groups will be subjected to the sensory effect of transcutaneous electrical neurostimulation (TENS).</description>
