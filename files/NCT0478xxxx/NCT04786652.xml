    <textblock>
      Postoperative period after off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCAB) can be a&#xD;
      challenging area for emerging methods for less-invasive continuous hemodynamic monitoring.It&#xD;
      is well known that OPCAB results in rapid changes in cardiac performance and vascular tone&#xD;
      affecting many hemodynamic variables. The patients demonstrating any pattern of hemodynamic&#xD;
      instability during and after major cardiac surgery can benefit from assessment of fluid&#xD;
      responsiveness both invasively and non-invasively. In addition to continuous monitoring of&#xD;
      cardiac output (CO), functional hemodynamic parameters as well as multiple dynamic tests are&#xD;
      of value when elaborating the goal-directed treatment plan and clinical decision-making.&#xD;
      Fluid responsiveness can be assessed using stroke volume variation (SVV) and pulse pressure&#xD;
      variation (PPV), as well as by non-invasive heart-lung interaction index (HLI, G5-Hamilton,&#xD;
      Switzerland) and pulse variability index (PVI, Masimo, USA). However, these parameters vary&#xD;
      in predictive value in different categories of patients. Thus, passive leg raising (PLR),&#xD;
      transient increase in positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and mini-fluid load test (mFL)&#xD;
      can be also used to assess the fluid status, both perioperatively and in critically ill&#xD;
      patients. The main advantages of these tests are their reversibility and simplicity. Both PLR&#xD;
      and mFL test can be readily performed in spontaneously breathing patients. The restoration of&#xD;
      the spontaneous breathing has been supposed to be a major limitation for the predictive value&#xD;
      of the functional hemodynamic parameters based on the cardiopulmonary interactions, namely,&#xD;
      SVV and PPV. However, recent studies have shown that spontaneous breathing activity does not&#xD;
      completely eliminate the accuracy of these parameters only expanding the &quot;grey zone&quot; of&#xD;
      indefinite values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among emerging techniques for continuous measurement of SVV and cardiac output, the&#xD;
      assessment of pulse wave transit time (PWTT) has recently become available in the clinical&#xD;
      practice. The latter method is based on the relationship between R-wave on ECG, SpO2, and&#xD;
      blood pressure, allowing assessment of estimated continuous stroke volume, SVV and CO (esSVV&#xD;
      and esCCO, Nihon Kohden, Japan). The potential advantage of this technique is relative&#xD;
      non-invasiveness. However, possible limitations include the dependence on signal quality,&#xD;
      calibration and intrinsic hemodynamic characteristics. The results of our pilot study of&#xD;
      esCCO in OPCAB demonstrate that during OPCAB, esCCO values overestimate CO and demonstrate&#xD;
      poor accuracy, precision, and trending ability compared to transpulmonary thermodilution&#xD;
      (TPTD). However, postoperatively esCCO showed better agreement with TPTD. The determination&#xD;
      of esSVV when CO2 is measured on the bedside monitor also requires further validation in&#xD;
      changing clinical settings both during mechanical ventilation and spontaneous breathing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goals of the study The primary goal of this study is to assess the accuracy of estimated&#xD;
      stroke volume variation (esSVV, Nihon Kohden, Japan) compared with SVV determined by&#xD;
      conventional pulse contour analysis (SVVPCA), respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary goals of this study are to assess the predictive value of esSVV in the early&#xD;
      postoperative period during complex dynamic tests including series of dynamic tests (passive&#xD;
      leg raising, increased PEEP, and mini-fluid load) followed by the standard fluid load in both&#xD;
      mechanically ventilated and spontaneously breathing patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Before OPCAB, after receiving the informed consent, all the patients will be&#xD;
      subjected to standard premedication. After transfer to the operation room, the&#xD;
      catheterization of radial artery using standard 20 G radial arterial catheter (Arteriofix,&#xD;
      B/Braun, Germany) and peripheral vein will be performed before induction of anesthesia. The&#xD;
      monitoring will also include ECG and SpO2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After standardized preoxygenation 80% O2 for 3 minutes the induction of anesthesia will be&#xD;
      conducted using propofol 1-1.5 mg/kg, fentanyl 5-7 mcg/kg and pipecuronium 0.1 mg/kg.&#xD;
      Thereafter anesthesia will be maintained with sevoflurane 0.5-3 vol.% with flow of 1 l/min&#xD;
      and fentanyl infusion of 2-4 mcg/kg/hr. EtCO2 will be monitored throughput the study period&#xD;
      using BSM9100 monitor (Nihon Kohden, Japan).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be mechanically ventilated using volume controlled ventilation (Primus,&#xD;
      Dräger, Germany) with FiO2 0.5, PEEP 5 cm H2O, VT 8 ml/kg PBW, and RR between 10 to 18 per&#xD;
      min to maintain EtCO2 30-35 mm Hg. After induction of anesthesia, the femoral artery will be&#xD;
      catheterized with a 5F arterial thermodilution catheter (Pulsiocath PV2015L20, Pulsion). An&#xD;
      8.5F 20-cm central venous catheter will be inserted into the internal jugular vein. The&#xD;
      thermodilution measurements will be performed in triplicate with a cooled (&lt; 8°C) 0.9% NaCl&#xD;
      solution injected via the central venous catheter. To maintain their fluid status, the&#xD;
      patients will receive continuous infusion of balanced crystalloid solutions using infusomate&#xD;
      (B|Braun) at the rate depending on initial global end-diastolic volume index (GEDVI) value:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GEDI &lt; 650 ml/m2 - 7 ml/kg/hr.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GEDI = 651-750 ml/m2 - 5 ml/kg/hr.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GEDI &gt; 750 ml/m2 - 3 ml/kg/hr. In cases of arterial hypotension (mean arterial pressure&#xD;
           &lt; 60 mm Hg for longer than 5 mins) despite fluid repletion the norepinephrine infusion&#xD;
           will be started. Goal-directed inotrope (dobutamine) and/or vasopressor (noradrenaline)&#xD;
           support is to be used in case of cardiac index &lt; 2.0 l/min/m2 (PiCCO2) and MAP &lt; 60 mm&#xD;
           Hg for more than 5 min, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All hemodynamic parameters will be electronically captured (PiCCO2 Science Version and Nihon&#xD;
      Kohden BSM 9100). The calibration of esCCO will be performed using invasive blood pressure&#xD;
      and patient data after transfer to ICU. In addition, all patients will be monitored for&#xD;
      respiratory mechanics, arterial and venous blood gases and lactate concentration, EtCO2,&#xD;
      SpO2, and depth of anesthesia (BIS monitoring). In addition, all the data retrieved from&#xD;
      PiCCO2 and esCCO will be electronically captured constantly with a predefined frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the intervention, all the patients will be transferred to the cardiosurgical ICU and&#xD;
      sedated with propofol (2-6 mg/kg/hr) during 30-60 min to prevent early emergence and&#xD;
      facilitate the assessment of fluid responsiveness and effects of recruitment maneuver and&#xD;
      fluid load tests. All patients will be ventilated in the IPPV volume-controlled mode with&#xD;
      FiO2 0.5, PEEP 5 cm H2O, VT 8 ml/kg PBW, and RR between 10 to 18 per min to maintain EtCO2&#xD;
      30-45 mm Hg. The fluid therapy will include balanced crystalloid infusion at rates of 2-3&#xD;
      ml/kg/hr during the first 6 hrs postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the measurements and tests will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In mechanically ventilated patients after OPCAB within two hrs after intervention:&#xD;
           passive leg raising (PLR), increased PEEP, and mini-fluid load (mFL) tests will be&#xD;
           followed by the standard fluid load (sFL). Monitoring: SVVPCA, PPVPCA, esSVV, HLI, PVI,&#xD;
           the pre-ejection fraction (PEP, echocardiography), CIPCA, esCI and CISTD. Transthoracic&#xD;
           echocardiography will be performed to assess the volume of heart chambers, ejection&#xD;
           fraction and pre-ejection phase (PEP).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In spontaneously breathing patients at 18 hrs of the postoperative period: PLR, and mFL&#xD;
           tests followed by sFL. Monitoring: SVVPCA, PPVPCA, esSVV, PVI, PEP, CIPCA, esCI and&#xD;
           CISTD. Transthoracic echocardiography will be performed to assess the volume of heart&#xD;
           chambers, ejection fraction and pre-ejection phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dynamic tests Passive leg raising (PLR) test will be performed by transient transferring of&#xD;
      the patient from a classic semi-recumbent position to elevated legs and horizontal trunk&#xD;
      position for 2 minutes. The effect will be assessed at 60 seconds after start of the test.3,4&#xD;
      The PEEP-test (in mechanically ventilated patients only) with PEEP increased from 5 to 20 cm&#xD;
      H2O for five minutes will be performed. The PEEP test will be discontinued in case of MAP&#xD;
      reduction below 50 mm Hg and/or bradycardia (below 40/min) or PCCI &lt; 1.5 l/min/m2 during the&#xD;
      period exceeding one minute. The measurements will be registered at 2 and 5 min after the&#xD;
      start of PEEP test.10 Mini-FLT (mFLT) of 1.5 ml/kg crystalloid within 1 min (approx. 100&#xD;
      mL).11,12 Standard FLT (5.5 mL/kg) within 5 min (approx. 400 mL). Both tests will be followed&#xD;
      by the registration of PCA-based CI, SVV, and PPV and PWTT-based esSVV and esCCO. The patient&#xD;
      will be assigned as &quot;fluid responsive&quot; if the standard fluid load test results in 15%&#xD;
      increase in CO determined with STD.12 The predictive value of complex dynamic test comprising&#xD;
      PLR, PEEP, and mFL tests will be explored and merged into one complex score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative infusion After sFL-test, the infusion will be maintained at rate of 1 ml/kg in&#xD;
      fluid responders (an increase of CI &gt; 15% after standard fluid load) and 0.5 ml/kg/hr in&#xD;
      non-responders using standard infusomate for titration (B|Braun).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to enroll 20 patients. The predictive value of esSVV for fluid responsiveness during&#xD;
      postoperative period will be assessed using ROC-analysis and compared with other functional&#xD;
      tests. The accuracy of esSVV measurements will be assessed using Pearson's or Spearman's&#xD;
      correlation coefficients and Bland-Altman analysis using PCA-based SVV values and STD-based&#xD;
      CO values as reference techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For SVV, the percentage error (PE) will be calculated as (1.96 × SD of the bias of the&#xD;
      methods / mean SVV of the two methods × 100%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the calculation of delta CO (ΔCO) between two consecutive measurements for both&#xD;
      methods by subtracting the value of preceding stage from that of the consequent stage, a&#xD;
      half-circle polar plot will be made. According to Critchley et al., central zone data with&#xD;
      mean ΔCO &lt; 10% representing statistical noise component will be excluded from further&#xD;
      analysis. Based on polar data, angular bias, radial limits of agreement and polar concordance&#xD;
      rate will be calculated. A trending ability will be assumed as good if angular bias will be&#xD;
      within ± 5°, radial limits of agreement within ± 30° and polar concordance rate at 30° will&#xD;
      be 95% or higher. For all the tests a p value &lt; 0.05 will be considered as significant.&#xD;
