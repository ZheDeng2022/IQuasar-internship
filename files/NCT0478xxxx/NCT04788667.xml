  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic migraine (CM) is a common and frequent disorder, which has a major impact on the&#xD;
      quality of life of migraine sufferers, interfering with physical function, productivity at&#xD;
      work, personal life and leisure, lifestyle and psychological well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of a prophylactic drug treatment is recommended if headache is present more than 8&#xD;
      days per month. In addition, several studies have shown benefits of non-pharmacological&#xD;
      interventions such as self-management strategies, manual therapy and exercise. However, no&#xD;
      studies have been found that analyse the beneficial effect of a combination of a preventive&#xD;
      drug treatment and a health education programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, this project would offer a service of health education through a telerehabilitation&#xD;
      programme for patients with chronic migraine under prophylactic drug treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to compare the combination of a prophylactic drug therapy and a&#xD;
      health education programme in the preventive treatment of patients with chronic&#xD;
      migraine.based on the hypothesis that a health education program for chronic migraine&#xD;
      patients could decrease the number of migraine days.&#xD;

      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomised, double-blind, controlled clinical trial will be conducted in two parallel&#xD;
      groups, in which all patients with migraine chronic are receiving prophylactic drug treatment&#xD;
      with Fremanezumab or Erenumab as prescribed by a physician. Moreover, patients in the&#xD;
      experimental group will receive a health education programme and patients in the control&#xD;
      group will receive a programme of general recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 4-week baseline data collection period is included to record the frequency and intensity of&#xD;
      migraine pain before starting the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will be carried out for 6 months with a follow-up at 1, 3 and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive health education through video-tutorials that can be watched on the&#xD;
      HEFORA platform. Each video-tutorial will contain the content of an educational session,&#xD;
      including health information in the areas of pain education, migraine neurophysiology,&#xD;
      relaxation techniques, sleep habits, eating habits, physical exercise, coping strategies and&#xD;
      emotion management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive video-tutorials with general recommendations though HEFORA platform.&#xD;
