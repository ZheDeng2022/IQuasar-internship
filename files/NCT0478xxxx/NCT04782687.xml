  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, phase II, open-label trial to investigate the effects of selinexor (S)&#xD;
      in combination with daratumumab, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (DRd) for first-line&#xD;
      treatment of multiple myeloma (MM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      FDA has approved selinexor plus dexamethasone in multiple myeloma after four prior therapies,&#xD;
      and DRd is also already approved by the FDA for multiple myeloma. This study will use all&#xD;
      four (S-DRd) together to treat MM as an initial treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable disease with high death rates as a result of developing&#xD;
      resistance to treatments. Even with the advent of novel therapies, myeloma patients&#xD;
      ultimately progress from frontline therapy. Common treatments include glucocorticoids,&#xD;
      chemotherapy, proteasome inhibitors (PIs), Immunomodulatory imide drugs (IMiDs), stem cell&#xD;
      transplants, and radiation therapy. Optimal frontline therapy with deeper remissions&#xD;
      translates to improved overall survival and progression free survival. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to investigate and improve upon reported outcomes in the frontline setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selinexor has shown potent anti-myeloma activity in preclinical models of MM and Phase 1,&#xD;
      Phase 2 clinical studies as well as in a randomized phase 3 clinical trial called BOSTON.&#xD;
      Selinexor was approved by the US FDA in July 2019 in combination with dexamethasone for the&#xD;
      treatment of adult patients relapsed/refractory (RR) MM who have received at least four prior&#xD;
      therapies and whose disease is refractory to at least two proteasome inhibitors, at least two&#xD;
      immunomodulatory agents, and an anti-CD38 (anti-cluster of differentiation 38) monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody. In June 2020, Selinexor was approved as a monotherapy by the FDA for adult patients&#xD;
      with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) after at least 2 lines of&#xD;
      systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with combination therapies including daratumumab, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone&#xD;
      has shown improvement in response rates, time to progression, and survival. Daratumumab is an&#xD;
      approved CD38-directed cytolytic antibody used as a monotherapy for patients with heavily&#xD;
      pre-treated MM, and in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone. The risk of death or&#xD;
      disease progression was 44% lower and increased overall response rate (ORR) of 92.9% was&#xD;
      observed in patients with newly diagnosed MM that received the triplet combination of&#xD;
      daratumumab, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (DRd) compared to lenalidomide and dexamethasone&#xD;
      alone (Rd).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tolerability of the DRd combination in patients was consistent between DRd and Rd treatments.&#xD;
      The safety profile of DRd was shown to be consistent with known safety profiles of&#xD;
      daratumumab and Rd. Higher rates of infections (upper respiratory tract infection and&#xD;
      pneumonia) and neutropenia in DRd treated patients than in Rd treated patients were observed.&#xD;
      However, grade 3 or 4 infections were similar between DRd and Rd treatment groups and were&#xD;
      managed by standard of care. After exposure to DRd for a median of 34 months, no new safety&#xD;
      concerns were observed in the extended follow-up of the POLLUX phase III study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preclinical data demonstrated that patient-derived MM cells were sensitized to the&#xD;
      combination of Selinexor and daratumumab compared to the single agents. Clinical data&#xD;
      demonstrate an ORR of 74% in patients with relapsed myeloma treated with Selinexor,&#xD;
      daratumumab, and dexamethasone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale for the combination of Selinexor, lenalidomide, daratumumab, and dexamethasone&#xD;
      (S-DRd) in the current study is based on the following: preclinical synergistic activities&#xD;
      observed with Selinexor and dexamethasone, the preclinical activity of Selinexor combined&#xD;
      with both lenalidomide and daratumumab; as well as the clinical experience of the combination&#xD;
      of Selinexor and lenalidomide/dexamethasone can be safely combined with 92% ORR in patients&#xD;
      with relapsed myeloma; and the combination of Selinexor and daratumumab/dexamethasone can&#xD;
      also be safely combined with an ORR of 74%. There is an urgent need to induce more efficient,&#xD;
      deeper and durable responses in patients with newly diagnosed MM.&#xD;

             could prevent, limit, or confound the protocol-specified assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Is considering becoming pregnant&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Has any condition for which, in the opinion of the investigator, participation would&#xD;
             not be in the best interest of the patient (e.g., compromise the well-being) or that&#xD;
             could prevent, limit, or confound the protocol- specified assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Has had major surgery within 2 weeks before C1D1, or will not have fully recovered&#xD;
             from surgery, or has surgery planned during the time the patient is expected to&#xD;
             participate in the study or within 2 weeks after the last dose of study drug&#xD;
             administration. (Note: patients with planned surgical procedures to be conducted under&#xD;
             local anesthesia may participate. Kyphoplasty is not considered a major surgery.)&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Is eligible for stem cell transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE: Investigators should ensure that all study enrollment criteria have been met at&#xD;
        screening. If a patient's status changes (including laboratory results or receipt of&#xD;
        additional medical records) after screening but before C1D1 such that he or she no longer&#xD;
        meets all eligibility criteria, then the patient should be excluded from participation in&#xD;
        the study.&#xD;
