      This study will determine the safety and efficacy of home administered tDCS in adults with&#xD;
      unipolar depression. The device used to administer tDCS will be the Soterix Medical 1X1&#xD;
      mini-CT. 32 tDCS sessions of 30 minutes each will be delivered over 10 weeks.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The Soterix Medical 1X1 mini-CT will be used to determine the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      home-based transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in treating unipolar depression.&#xD;
      Specifically efficacy will be determined by change in MADRS score from baseline to the 10&#xD;
      week follow-up. Feasibility and compliance will be determined by low drop out rate and&#xD;
      percentage of scheduled sessions completed. Self-reported mood scores will be evaluated using&#xD;
      the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS-SR) and Quality of Life enjoyment and&#xD;
      Satisfaction Questionnaire Form (Q-LES-Q-SF). All visits will be performed via telephone or&#xD;
      video conference. Subjects will be taught to operate the tDCS system and complete a&#xD;
      tolerability check. The treatment course will consist of an acute phase of 28 tDCS sessions&#xD;
      conducted Monday - Friday over 6 weeks. This is followed by a taper of 4 tDCS sessions spaced&#xD;
      1 week apart. Patients who meet criteria for clinical response (&gt;=50% improvement in MADRS)&#xD;
      may continue with maintenance treatments of once a week for 2 months and once every 2 weeks&#xD;
      for the remaining 3 months. Mood assessments will be conducted at baseline, 2 weeks, 4 weeks&#xD;
      and 6 weeks in the acute treatment phase. In the taper phase, assessments wil be conducted at&#xD;
      1 month (end of taper), 3 and 6 months following completion of the acute phase. All&#xD;
      assessments in the acute treatment phase and the taper phase will have a +/- 1 week&#xD;
      collection window.&#xD;
