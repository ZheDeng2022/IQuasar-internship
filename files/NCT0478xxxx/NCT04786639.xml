  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The management of proximal humerus fractures (PHFs) remains a significant challenge in&#xD;
      orthopaedics. The acute treatment options for PHFs are numerous and are typically guided by&#xD;
      the fracture pattern and functional demands of the patients. The most commonly used methods&#xD;
      include non-operative management with a sling or surgical fixation. Although non-surgical&#xD;
      treatment is a reasonable treatment option for the majority of humerus fractures, there is an&#xD;
      increasing interest in surgical intervention. There are no evidence-based treatment&#xD;
      recommendations, thus permitting large local variation in treatment preferences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are a number of studies in the literature about how outcome measures of the patients&#xD;
      after PHFs management change, but these results generally compare functional results before&#xD;
      and after treatment. Misra et al. stated that conservatively managed patients with PHFs have&#xD;
      more pain and a poorer range of motion than those managed by either fixation or arthroplasty,&#xD;
      while cochrane review stated that surgery is not superior to nonsurgical treatment in most&#xD;
      proximal humerus fractures. Jayakumar et al. determined that kinesiophobia is one of the&#xD;
      strongest predictors of functional limitation and recovery from a PHF is enhanced by&#xD;
      overcoming fears of movement or reinjury within a week after injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no clear knowledge regarding how the surgical or conservative management used in the&#xD;
      management of PHF affects the early results of assessment parameters. The aim of this study&#xD;
      was to compare early results of surgical fixation versus non-operative management outcomes in&#xD;
      patients with proximal humerus fractures.&#xD;

      Voluntary patients who have been diagnosed with proximal humerus fracture and managed by&#xD;
      surgical or conservative will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with stabilization after proximal humerus fracture with surgical fixation will be&#xD;
      considered as the Surgery group, and patients treated with non-surgical treatment with sling&#xD;
      immobilization will be considered as the Conservative group. Signed voluntary consent will be&#xD;
      obtained from participants. Patients having surgical fixation or nonoperative management will&#xD;
      be assessed for kinesiophobia, pain, range of motion, functional status, and quality of life.&#xD;

    <measure>Kinesiophobia</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Tampa kinesiophobia scale will be used for determining of kinesiophobia or fear of movement.The Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia is a 17 item questionnaire used to assess the subjective rating of kinesiophobia or fear of movement. The score varies between 17 and high scores indicate an increasing degree of kinesiophobia.</description>

    <measure>Shoulder Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>A Visual Analogue Scale will be used for pain of rest, night and activity. It is a scale measuring the distance (mm) on the 10-cm line between the &quot;no pain&quot; (0) and and &quot; worst pain (10).</description>

    <measure>Range of Motion</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Shoulder flexion, extension, external and internal rotation will be measured by using digital goniometer. It is a reliable and valid tool for measuring shoulder range of motion in individuals with healthy shoulders. Increasing the degree is considered as an improvement in the range of motion.</description>

    <description>The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire will be used for measuring of self-rated upper-extremity disability and symptoms. The scale score ranging is from 0 (no disability) to 100 (most severe disability).</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life of the patients</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The quality of life will be assessed by using 36-Item Short Form Survey. The survey has eight sub scaled scores; vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning and mental health. Scores range from 0 - 100 and higher scores shows less disability.</description>
