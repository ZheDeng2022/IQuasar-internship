      This open label, flexible-dose study evaluating the safety and efficacy of SPN-812&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, flexible-dose, safety study of SPN-812 in pediatric&#xD;
      patients (6-17 years of age) diagnosed with ADHD, when administered with a FDA-approved&#xD;
      medication (psychostimulant) in the treatment of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder&#xD;
      (ADHD) in pediatric subjects. Participants will be screened for eligibilty for up to 4 weeks,&#xD;
      and he/she will continue to take their prescribed psychostimulant ADHD medication during that&#xD;
      time. Following the screening period, eligible subjects will receive SPN-812 with their&#xD;
      current psychostimulant treatment for ADHD for 8 weeks. For the first 4 weeks of treatment&#xD;
      subjects will take SPN-812 dose in the morning (AM dosing), and for the last 4 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment, subjects will take SPN-812 dose in the evening (PM dosing). The total duration of&#xD;
      the study between the screening visit and the end of the treatment period/end of study (EOS)&#xD;
      visit is up to 12 weeks.&#xD;

&#xD;
         13. Females of childbearing potential (FOCP) must be either sexually inactive (abstinent)&#xD;
             or, if sexually active, must agree to use one of the following acceptable, highly&#xD;
             effective contraceptive methods beginning 28 days prior to the first dose of SM and&#xD;

         14. Adolescent males, if sexually active, must:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Use 2 methods of contraception in combination if his female partner is of&#xD;
                  childbearing potential; this combination of contraceptive methods must be used&#xD;

&#xD;
               2. Have been surgically sterilized prior to the Screening Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Has previously enrolled/participated in a previous SPN-812 clinical trial or is&#xD;
