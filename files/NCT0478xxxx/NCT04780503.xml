  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are some criteria such as the most frequently used parameters to predict the failure of&#xD;
      non-invasive mechanical ventilation, the APACHE 2 score, the presence of pneumonia and ARDS&#xD;
      in the etiology, and no improvement in one hour of treatment. However, APECHE 2 score, which&#xD;
      is the broadest of these criteria and includes others, is a complex scoring in which a large&#xD;
      number of parameters are evaluated together, dependent on laboratory results and still leaves&#xD;
      the final decision to the physician with a complete evaluation. In addition, the APACHE 2&#xD;
      score is a more commonly used method for intensive care patients rather than emergency&#xD;
      patients who need a quick decision. Therefore, there is a need for a fast and practical&#xD;
      method that can predict NIMV failure and determine early intubation decision in the&#xD;
      management of patients admitted to the emergency department with acute dyspnea. Rapid Shallow&#xD;
      Breathing Index (RSBI) is a parameter calculated by dividing the respiratory rate by the&#xD;
      tidal volume and is used to predict whether patients who are intubated in intensive care unit&#xD;
      can be extubated successfully.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the success of RSBI in predicting intubation and&#xD;
      mortality in patients presented to the emergency department with acute respiratory failure&#xD;
      and had NIMV indication.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory failure is a challenging health problem that constitutes a significant part of&#xD;
      emergency room visits (1). Acute respiratory failure treatment is a complex process in which&#xD;
      pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods are used in combination. Non-invasive&#xD;
      Mechanical Ventilation (NIMV) and Invasive Mechanical Ventilation (IMV) are life-saving&#xD;
      methods commonly used in the emergency department in severe respiratory failure (2). In&#xD;
      patients with severe dyspnea, NIMV improves alveolar gas exchange, with very successful&#xD;
      results in selected patients (3). However, while NIMV cannot be used in patients who are&#xD;
      unconscious, unable to protect the airway, have upper gastrointestinal bleeding and facial&#xD;
      trauma and cannot adapt to non-invasive mechanical ventilation, these patients have IMV&#xD;
      indication. Both methods are quite successful when used in selected cases. Therefore, patient&#xD;
      selection is very important for NIMV and IMV (4). It is known that endotracheal intubation&#xD;
      increases the risk of developing complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia and&#xD;
      sepsis. Therefore, unnecessary endotracheal intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation&#xD;
      therapy are expected to increase mortality (5). On the other hand, delayed intubation&#xD;
      decision is known to be an independent risk factor for increased mortality when NIMV fails&#xD;
      (6) (7) (8). A method that predicts NIMV failure and enables effective mortality estimation&#xD;
      may be useful in facilitating patient selection and providing appropriate treatment to&#xD;
      patients. There are some criteria predicting that NIMV will fail in patients with severe&#xD;
      respiratory distress and may be guiding for early intubation. The most commonly used of these&#xD;
      are high APACHE 2 score, ARDS or pneumonia as the etiology of respiratory distress, advanced&#xD;
      age, and no clinical improvement after 1 hour of treatment (9). However, APECHE 2 score,&#xD;
      which is the broadest of these criteria and includes others, is a complex scoring in which a&#xD;
      large number of parameters are evaluated together, dependent on laboratory results and still&#xD;
      leaves the final decision to the physician with a complete evaluation. In addition, the&#xD;
      APACHE 2 score is a more commonly used method for intensive care patients rather than&#xD;
      emergency patients who need a quick decision. Therefore, there is a need for a fast and&#xD;
      practical method that can predict NIMV failure and determine early intubation decision in the&#xD;
      management of patients admitted to the emergency department with acute dyspnea. Rapid Shallow&#xD;
      Breathing Index (RSBI) is a parameter calculated by dividing the respiratory rate by the&#xD;
      tidal volume and is used to predict whether patients who are intubated in intensive care unit&#xD;
      can be extubated successfully (10). In a study by Berg et al. (11) evaluating the&#xD;
      endotracheal intubation and mortality rates of patients who underwent NIMV, it was found that&#xD;
      the RSBI value above 105 obtained with a single measurement was significant in predicting NIV&#xD;
      failure. Although this result is significant, it is not sufficient to make an early&#xD;
      intubation decision. Considering that serial measurements are found to be more meaningful&#xD;
      than a single measurement while predicting weaning success (12), serial measurements can&#xD;
      provide more successful results in predicting intubation and mortality of patients receiving&#xD;
      NIMV. Although the RSBI value obtained immediately after the initiation of NIMV is high, it&#xD;
      is possible for the patient to be relieved after the patient has been treated with NIMV for a&#xD;
      while and thus, the RSBI value may also decrease. For this reason, after these patients have&#xD;
      been treated for a while, obtaining RSBI value once again and looking at the patient's&#xD;
      response to treatment may provide more meaningful results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the success of RSBI in predicting intubation and&#xD;
      mortality in patients presented to the emergency department with acute respiratory failure&#xD;
      and had NIMV indication.&#xD;
