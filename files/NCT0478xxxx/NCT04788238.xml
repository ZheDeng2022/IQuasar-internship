      The study aims to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a Dual-Task Zumba Gold (DTZ)&#xD;
      intervention that will support physical and cognitive training among community-dwelling&#xD;
      persons with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and to determine its preliminary efficacy among&#xD;
      Filipinos with MCI. A 12-week Dual-Task Zumba Gold (DTZ) intervention will be implemented&#xD;
      among 30 participants with MCI in the treatment group, while health education will be&#xD;
      provided to another 30 subjects allocated in the control group. Quantitative and qualitative&#xD;
      methods will be employed to assess the feasibility and acceptability outcomes of the study.&#xD;
      Changes in cognitive function, together with the quality of life, mood, functional mobility,&#xD;
      and bodily measures, will be re-assessed after the 12-week intervention and a 6-week&#xD;
      follow-up period.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background: Dementia risk reduction is considered a public health priority. However, there is&#xD;
      a paucity of related interventions among low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), such as&#xD;
      the Philippines, despite the higher number of dementia cases in these regions. Meanwhile,&#xD;
      individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), being at risk for dementia, are important&#xD;
      targets for interventions to promote cognitive health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The enrichment of physical activities with cognitive exercises, known as dual-task training,&#xD;
      is an innovative approach that has been noted to potentially improve cognitive outcomes in&#xD;
      persons with MCI. Zumba is a popular dance worldwide, which combines rhythmic aerobic steps&#xD;
      and whole-body movements. It has a modified version for older adults, called Zumba Gold, but&#xD;
      information about its effects on older people is limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Literature states that ensuring sufficient cognitive load in complex motor activities is&#xD;
      important to achieve significant and superior cognitive outcomes. Dual-Task Zumba Gold (DTZ),&#xD;
      an intervention combining Zumba Gold and simultaneous cognitive training, and is a novel and&#xD;
      inexpensive non-pharmacological intervention that may enhance the cognition of persons at&#xD;
      risk for dementia. However, its feasibility and potential efficacy among older people with&#xD;
      MCI are unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives of the Study: There are two objectives in this study: (1) To determine the&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability of a Dual-Task Zumba Gold (DTZ) intervention among&#xD;
      community-dwelling individuals with MCI. (2) To investigate the preliminary efficacy of the&#xD;
      DTZ intervention in improving the cognitive function among the recruited participants with&#xD;
      MCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This is a mixed-method pilot study, involving quantitative and qualitative methods&#xD;
      to evaluate the study outcomes. The proposed 12-week DTZ intervention will be conducted three&#xD;
      times/week for 45-60 minutes among individuals with MCI. Cognitive domains of executive&#xD;
      function, visuospatial ability, memory, and complex attention will be stimulated through&#xD;
      mental exercises which will be performed concurrently with the dance steps during particular&#xD;
      sequences of the Zumba Gold dance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixty participants will be recruited, and then randomly allocated to treatment (DTZ) and&#xD;
      control groups (health education). The feasibility of the intervention will be assessed by&#xD;
      participant recruitment and retention rate, adherence rate, and implementation fidelity.&#xD;
      Acceptability will be evaluated quantitatively via self-report attitudes towards the&#xD;
      intervention. Moreover, qualitative data will be collected via focus group discussions to&#xD;
      obtain their feedback toward the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in cognitive function will be assessed as the primary outcomes, to be measured via&#xD;
      the following tools: Philippine versions of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-P) and&#xD;
      Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE-P) for global cognition; Trail Making Tests A and B (TMT&#xD;
      A &amp; B) for executive functioning; Digit Span Test (DST) and MoCA-Memory Index Score&#xD;
      (MoCA-MIS) for memory. Secondary outcomes to be evaluated include quality of life (Perceived&#xD;
      Well-being Scale), mood (Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Form), functional mobility (Short&#xD;
      Physical Performance Battery), and bodily measures (blood pressure, body mass index, and&#xD;
      waist circumference).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Content analysis will be utilized to analyze qualitative data from the interviews. Meanwhile,&#xD;
      descriptive statistics, Chi-square test, and independent t-test will be used to analyze the&#xD;
      subjects' characteristics and compare the two groups at baseline. General Linear Model (GLM)&#xD;
      approach will be used to determine the intervention's preliminary efficacy at the&#xD;
      post-treatment period.&#xD;

    <description>Dual-Task Zumba Gold is a 12-week program to be conducted thrice weekly for 45-60 minutes. The intervention involves the concurrent performance of cognitive tasks and physical movements during specific parts of the dance. The activity will begin with warm-up and end with cool-down periods, at 5 to 10 minutes each. Orientation training will be done during the warm-up period, by asking questions to participants about time, place, and person. In the actual dance (30 to 40 minutes), the following domains will be trained: executive function (forward and backward serial counting); perceptual-motor ability (performing arm clock positions based on instructions); memory (forward and backward repetition of number/word series), and attention (forward and backward spelling of 3- to 5-letter words). The cool-down period will incorporate memory training by reminding the participants to summarize the activities performed.</description>
