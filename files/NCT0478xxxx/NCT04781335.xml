  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cataract surgery is the most common surgical procedure performed on humans today. The&#xD;
      postoperative regimen includes a combination of steroids, NSAIDs (non-steroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs) and antibiotics. Those are used to decrease the possibility of&#xD;
      infection, inflammation that may lead to corneal and macular edema and pain management. There&#xD;
      are several FDA approved agents either for topical use as single drug delivery or combination&#xD;
      solutions for topical use as well; furthermore, there are slow release vehicles that may be&#xD;
      placed at the time of surgery or postoperatively (at the lower punctum). The latter provides&#xD;
      a less intense and demanding drop schedule and may improve patient compliance.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current study will assess post cataract the efficacy and safety of two different FDA&#xD;
      approved regimens, which include the standard of care (topical steroids, NSAIDs and&#xD;
      antibiotics) or Intracameral Dexamethasone (Dexycu™) along with topical NSAIDs and&#xD;
      antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of the current study is that topical steroids or intracamerally injected&#xD;
      steroids as slow release vehicles, demonstrate the same efficacy of controlling post cataract&#xD;
      pain and inflammation. We will assess one objective outcome measure, anterior chamber&#xD;
      inflammation. This will provide a direct index of the efficacy of the steroidal agents used.&#xD;
      Furthermore, a subjective outcome measure, ocular pain, will also be assessed. In cases where&#xD;
      a patient in either of the two groups has sever inflammation, rescue medications will be&#xD;
      applied, increasing the dosage of topical steroidal agents and the patient will be followed&#xD;
      closely until resolved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include 50 consecutive patients, men and women ages 40 to 90 years old, with&#xD;
      visually significant cataract that received bilateral cataract surgery using either the&#xD;
      manual technique or femtosecond assisted cataract surgery. Bilateral surgery is common&#xD;
      practice and is not performed on the same day. There is a one week time interval between the&#xD;
      eyes receiving cataract extraction. The patients that we will enroll in the suggested study&#xD;
      will require and will receive bilateral cataract surgery with one week time interval between&#xD;
      the two eyes. There are no restrictions on racial or ethnic origin. Employees of The Eye&#xD;
      Institute of West Florida will not be enrolled into this study.&#xD;

The patients will receive the SAME topical regimen (Eye with Dexycu™: no steroid, Eye without Dexycu™: steroid will be used). The Dexycu™, topical NSAID, and antibiotic regimen will be provided to all patients in the study, at no cost, in order to avoid difficulties with compliance, insurance, and follow up.</description>
