    <textblock>
      This work aimed to evaluate and compare the impact of adding hypertonic saline solution (HSS)&#xD;
      infusion and/or etilefrine to oral diuretics therapy on clinical outcomes, renal and systemic&#xD;
      hemodynamics, metabolic and inflammatory pathways by estimating the changes in selected&#xD;
      biological markers in cirrhotic patients with ascites. Also, the trial aims to assess the&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of such treatment regimens.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This comparative, randomized, prospective controlled clinical trial was conducted on 90&#xD;
      cirrhotic patients with ascites who were admitted to the Hepatology Department of National&#xD;
      Liver Institute, Menoufiya University. The study was approved by the Institution Review Board&#xD;
      (IRB) of the National Liver Institute (NLI), Menoufiya University, Egypt with NLI/IRB&#xD;
      protocol number: 00131/2017. Informed consent was obtained from all patients who participated&#xD;
      in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were randomized into four groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group I: (n=15) received oral standard diuretic therapy (furosemide 40 mg plus spironolactone&#xD;
      100 mg with dose increase in 40 mg :100 mg ratio).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group II: (n=25) received (150 ml,1.4% - 4.6%) of hypertonic saline solution (HSS) plus&#xD;
      standard diuretics therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group III: (n=25) received etilefrine 5 mg tablets 3 times daily plus standard diuretics&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group IV: (n=25) received (150 ml, 1.4% - 4.6%) of HSS and etilefrine 5 mg tablets 3 times&#xD;
      daily plus standard diuretics therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time frame:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral standard diuretics therapy administered for 38 days. Etilefrine tablets administered for&#xD;
      38 days. Infusion of HSS administered for eight days. Diuretics dosage reassessed according&#xD;
      to blood pressure, diuresis, serum sodium, and serum potassium levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All blood and urine samples were collected and measured as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. At baseline before initiation of any treatment (first measurement)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Eight days after treatment with studied medications (second measurement).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. One month after the second measurement (third measurement).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Venous blood samples were drawn from enrolled patients in the morning before treatment (first&#xD;
      measurement), after eight days (second measurement), and after a month from the second&#xD;
      measurement (third measurement). Blood samples were centrifuged and the resulting supernatant&#xD;
      was frozen at -80 C until all samples were collected. 24-hr urine was collected in the&#xD;
      morning from 7 am to 7 am of the next day before initiation of treatment, after eight days of&#xD;
      treatment, and after a month from the second measurement to assess diuresis and urinary&#xD;
      creatinine, urinary Na, and urinary K, also hepatic and renal functions, complete blood&#xD;
      count, serum levels of c-reactive protein, interleukin-6, aldosterone, and leptin were&#xD;
      measured at baseline, after eight days and, after a month from the second measurement.&#xD;
