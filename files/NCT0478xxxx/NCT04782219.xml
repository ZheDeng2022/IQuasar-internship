  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be carried out on 100 patients with chronic musculoskeletal disorders who&#xD;
      applied to Acıbadem Maslak Hospital Orthopedics and Traumatology Department. Demographic&#xD;
      information (age, education level, occupation, marital status) will be obtained from the&#xD;
      patients, they will be asked whether they have a chronic musculoskeletal disease diagnosed by&#xD;
      the doctor, and they will be asked to fill in the PROMIS 29 and SF-36 v2 questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PROMIS 29 questionnaire contains 4 questions from each of the seven contents of PROMIS&#xD;
      (physical function, depression, anxiety, fatigue, sleep disorder, participation in social&#xD;
      activities and pain interaction) and 1 question from the intensity of pain. Each item has 5&#xD;
      answer options (from 1 to 5), only pain intensity has 11 answer options (from 0 to 10). From&#xD;
      the sum of the answers to each question in the domain, the total raw score for each domain is&#xD;
      calculated, resulting in seven domain scores, each between 4 and 20. SF-36 is the most widely&#xD;
      used scale to assess general health status, and 36 items question 8 content (physical&#xD;
      function, physical role, pain, general health, social function, energy / fitness, social&#xD;
      function, emotional role, mental health). The Turkish translation of the PROMIS 29&#xD;
      questionnaire is presented in ANNEX-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The translation of the PROMIS 29 questionnaire into Turkish was made by Northwestern&#xD;
      University according to the FACIT translation method. Its Turkish translation was obtained&#xD;
      from Northwestern University by signing a license agreement for use in scientific research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will first be asked to sign the informed consent form electronically. PROMIS 29&#xD;
      and SF-36 v2 forms will be sent to the volunteers via e-mail and will be asked to respond via&#xD;
      an internet-based questionnaire platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The external validity of the PROMIS 29 questionnaire will be evaluated by its correlation&#xD;
      with the SF-36 v2, a similar general health profile questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate inter-rater test-retest reliability, both scales will be filled in by patients a&#xD;
      second time between 7-14 days.&#xD;
