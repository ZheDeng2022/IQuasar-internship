      The AMH^2 (Anti-Mullerian Hormone - At My Home) study is a head-to-head-to-head validation&#xD;
      study aiming to evaluate the concordance of AMH levels found in blood collected via three&#xD;
      different routes: collected at-home using the TAP II device, drawn through standard&#xD;
      venipuncture techniques, and collected with the ADx card, another at-home collection device&#xD;
      widely available on the market for commercial use.&#xD;

      Today, information regarding fertility potential is challenging to obtain for healthy women;&#xD;
      clinically meaningful in-clinic testing is limited by physician availability and patient&#xD;
      willingness to undergo testing in-clinic. Meanwhile, at-home hormonal bloodwork relies on the&#xD;
      use of an ADx card, and is not widely accepted as clinically reliable by the medical&#xD;
      community. The Sponsor is developing a comprehensive home fertility assessment to enable&#xD;
      couples to proactively estimate and manage their fertility and family building options.&#xD;
      Accurate and reliable at-home AMH testing is necessary to reach this goal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to validate the clinical excellence and medical accuracy of blood drawn via&#xD;
      the TAP II device relative to a standard in-clinic venipuncture draw and other options&#xD;
      available on the market to support emerging telemedicine care models. In doing so, the&#xD;
      Sponsor may receive CLIA validation for the TAP II in AMH testing and commercialize a Lab&#xD;
      Developed Test.&#xD;
