  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an efficacy and safety study of cosibelimab (CK-301) combined with&#xD;
      pemetrexed/platinum chemotherapy versus pemetrexed/platinum chemotherapy alone in&#xD;
      participants with advanced or metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who&#xD;
      have not previously received systemic therapy for advanced disease. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive cosibelimab combined with pemetrexed/platinum&#xD;
      (Investigators choice of cisplatin or carboplatin), OR pemetrexed/platinum (Investigators&#xD;
      choice of cisplatin or carboplatin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis is that cosibelimab in combination with pemetrexed/platinum&#xD;
      chemotherapy prolongs Overall Survival (OS) compared to pemetrexed/platinum chemotherapy&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;
