  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project targets dietary lapses (instances of nonadherence to dietary goals), a major&#xD;
      cause of poor outcomes during behavioral obesity treatment, which is a recommended first-line&#xD;
      intervention for cardiovascular disease. The investigators propose to conduct a&#xD;
      micro-randomized trial (MRT) to empirically optimize a smartphone-based just-in-time adaptive&#xD;
      intervention (JITAI) that monitors risk and intervenes on lapses as needed. By evaluating the&#xD;
      immediate, proximal effect of four theory-driven interventions on lapse behavior, the project&#xD;
      will: (a) produce a scalable, finalized JITAI that has the greatest potential to show clear&#xD;
      clinical impact in future trials; and (b) inform the development of more sophisticated&#xD;
      theoretical models of adherence behavior more broadly. Therefore, this study has three goals.&#xD;
      First the investigators aim to compare the effects of delivering any intervention to no&#xD;
      intervention on the occurrence of lapse. Second, the investigators aim to compare the effects&#xD;
      of specific theory-driven interventions to one another to determine which ones are best for&#xD;
      preventing lapses. Within this second aim, the investigators also aim to examine other&#xD;
      factors that may influence the effectiveness of interventions (e.g., time, location). Lastly,&#xD;
      the investigators will use the data from this MRT to customize intervention delivery in&#xD;
      future versions of this JITAI&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited through various methods including advertisements in local media,&#xD;
      targeted online advertising, advertisements in medical and minority communities, and direct&#xD;
      mailers. All participants will receive a well-established 3-month online obesity treatment&#xD;
      program, with 3 months of no-treatment follow-up. In conjunction, they will use a&#xD;
      smartphone-based JITAI consisting of: 1) repeated daily surveys assess lapses and relevant&#xD;
      triggers; 2) a machine learning algorithm that uses information from the surveys to determine&#xD;
      real-time lapse risk; &amp; 3) interventions to counter lapse risk. When an individual is at risk&#xD;
      for lapsing she will be randomly assigned to no intervention, a generic risk alert, or one of&#xD;
      4 theory-driven interventions with interactive skills training. The outcome of interest will&#xD;
      be the occurrence (or lack thereof) of dietary lapse, as measured both subjectively (i.e.,&#xD;
      reported by the participant in the daily surveys) and objectively (i.e., via wrist-based&#xD;
      intake monitoring), in the hours following randomization initiated by heightened lapse risk.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the 6-month micro-randomized Trial (MRT) is to optimize a just-in-time&#xD;
      adaptive intervention (JITAI) for dietary lapses by evaluating the effects of 4 theory-driven&#xD;
      interventions on the proximal outcome of dietary lapse as compared to active and inactive&#xD;
      comparators. The proposed JITAI has been extensively piloted, and will now be executed using&#xD;
      a well-known NIH-funded mobile platform (PiLR Health). Prior to commencement of the main&#xD;
      trial, a small group of participants will be recruited to iteratively pilot the&#xD;
      below-described procedures for 3 months. These data are for piloting/testing only and will&#xD;
      not be used in the analysis of primary outcomes. Participants in the main trial (N=159) will&#xD;
      receive 3 months of online behavioral obesity treatment (BOT) + JITAI followed by 3 months of&#xD;
      JITAI-only. The MRT includes sequential randomization to intervention options each time the&#xD;
      JITAI identifies heightened lapse risk. The primary outcome is dietary lapse (assessed via&#xD;
      repeated surveys called ecological momentary assessments [EMA]). The secondary outcome is&#xD;
      objectively-measured eating characteristics (via wrist-watch device at assessments). The&#xD;
      investigators will also assess contextual moderators (i.e., location, time of day, active&#xD;
      BOT/follow-up, trigger type) for the study's exploratory aim. JITAI engagement, satisfaction,&#xD;
      and weight will be used for descriptive purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited on a rolling basis (~6-7 participants/month) until the target&#xD;
      N=159 is reached. Participants will be recruited via advertisements in local media (e.g.&#xD;
      newspapers, radio) and targeted online advertising (e.g., Google AdWords); flyers and&#xD;
      advertisements posted in waiting rooms and exam rooms in primary care offices, informational&#xD;
      materials made available as part of the health and wellness program for employees in the&#xD;
      Lifespan heath system and hospital network (an approach used in a previous trials); and&#xD;
      direct mailings. Minority participation will be increased via ads in newspapers with high&#xD;
      circulation in minority communities. Recruitment flyers will also be sent to agencies serving&#xD;
      minority groups. The investigators will use online advertisements on local websites that are&#xD;
      popular with men and minority groups. The investigators consistently find that these&#xD;
      approaches maximize minority and male recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All following procedures described will be offered both in-person at the research center, or&#xD;
      remotely via the video chat forum Zoom. The remote option is in response to the COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic. Participants who choose to attend in-person assessments will use self-report&#xD;
      screening procedures consistent with hospital policy to ensure that the participant has not&#xD;
      been recently or is currently ill. Rigorous sanitization procedures will be used for&#xD;
      equipment and office space pre- and post-assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interested individuals will be initially screened for eligibility via REDCap, a Lifespan&#xD;
      secure website. If a participant appears to be eligible based on their survey responses, they&#xD;
      will receive a follow-up call from the research team to confirm eligibility, describe the&#xD;
      study in more detail, and schedule an orientation meeting. If they are not eligible, they&#xD;
      will receive a message indicating that they are not eligible for the study and directed to&#xD;
      contact us if they wish to receive referrals for other weight loss programs. Those who are&#xD;
      eligible will be invited to an orientation, either in-person at the research center or via&#xD;
      the online video chat forum Zoom, where the study will be described and informed consent&#xD;
      obtained. Individuals who decide to complete the orientation via Zoom will be sent a consent&#xD;
      form to their home address before the call. Only after the consent form is signed and&#xD;
      returned will any further study procedures be completed. If consent is not given, participant&#xD;
      contact information will be immediately removed from the system. After consent is obtained,&#xD;
      participants will complete baseline questionnaires, either by paper surveys or using&#xD;
      Lifespan's secure REDCap website, and they will complete self-reported logs of what they eat&#xD;
      and drink and EMA for 1 week before their baseline assessment. If a participant elects to use&#xD;
      a paper questionnaire and does not wish to be present at the research center, the&#xD;
      questionnaire will be sent to the participant's home address. Participants must complete &gt;70%&#xD;
      of EMA surveys and 7 days of dietary self-monitoring to move forward with the remainder of&#xD;
      study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following consent and successful completion of baseline procedures, participants will attend&#xD;
      a &quot;kick-off&quot; session (either in-person or remotely) to assist them in using the intervention&#xD;
      tools. Participants will be given access to an online BOT (described further in the&#xD;
      Intervention section) for 3 months, with an additional 3-month no treatment follow-up. They&#xD;
      will also be asked to use the JITAI for the entire 6-month study period. The JITAI operates&#xD;
      through PiLR Health, and will utilize ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to repeatedly&#xD;
      assess lapse triggers and dietary lapses. The EMA survey responses are immediately uploaded&#xD;
      to a HIPAA-compliant server, where a previously-validated predictive algorithm determines if&#xD;
      the participant may be at risk for a lapse based on what they reported. When a participant is&#xD;
      determined to be at risk for a lapse after completing an EMA survey, the PiLR Health system&#xD;
      server will micro-randomize the delivery of intervention. The randomization is independent of&#xD;
      prior randomizations and the participants' responses to previously delivered interventions&#xD;
      for lapse. Based on the investigator's prior research developing this JITAI, the algorithm&#xD;
      predicts heightened states of lapse risk approximately once per day. The once/day estimate is&#xD;
      representative of an average across participants and the investigators have demonstrated&#xD;
      there is substantial individual variability to these data; heightened states of lapse risk&#xD;
      can range from 2.75/week to 12/week and fluctuate over time. As such, while the estimated&#xD;
      average is once per day, the prediction algorithm within the proposed JITAI ensures that&#xD;
      intervention is provided in exact moments of individual need - which is not static within or&#xD;
      between individuals - thus reducing participant burden and improving potency of intervention.&#xD;
      The study methods are therefore a considerable improvement to providing general daily&#xD;
      reminders. Based on these data, intervention options will be randomized an average of 180&#xD;
      times for each participant. The theory-driven intervention conditions, which have empirical&#xD;
      support, include: (a) education to promote awareness of lapse triggers; (b) self-efficacy;&#xD;
      (c) motivation; &amp; (d) self-regulation skills. Given the primary aim of comparing the&#xD;
      immediate, proximal effect of intervention (as compared to no intervention), interventions&#xD;
      will be randomized based on the following probabilities: 0.4 no intervention (inactive&#xD;
      control), 0.12 to generic risk alerts (active control), 0.12 to Enhanced Education, 0.12 to&#xD;
      Self-efficacy, 0.12 to Autonomous Motivation, and 0.12 to Self-regulation. As such, a given&#xD;
      participant will receive no intervention at approximately 72 randomization points over the&#xD;
      study and 107 (~21-22 each) randomization points will be divided equally among the remaining&#xD;
      5 intervention options. All JITAI interventions are described in the Intervention section&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to data they are providing through the JITAI, participants will complete 3 total&#xD;
      assessments with a research assistant (who does not need to be blinded due to sequential&#xD;
      randomization) at baseline, 3, and 6 months. During the baseline assessment, height, weight,&#xD;
      demographic information and weight history will be collected either by a study staff,&#xD;
      cellular scale, or self-report. Objective data collection will be the priority, so if a&#xD;
      participant elects to attend their assessment via Zoom, cellular scales may be mailed to the&#xD;
      participant's home address. Participants will be asked to wear a wrist-watch device (called&#xD;
      an Actigraph) to measure eating behavior for two weeks following the baseline appointment.&#xD;
      The participant will be given the Actigraph device in-person during the baseline assessment,&#xD;
      or by mail to their home address if they choose to attend the assessment via Zoom (the device&#xD;
      will be mailed back to the study team or dropped off in-person). Also, during the baseline&#xD;
      assessment, participants will be provided with a calorie and physical activity goal, overview&#xD;
      of the program, and tutorial for using the smartphone app and online program. The&#xD;
      participants will be asked to complete similar assessments at 3 months and 6 months.&#xD;

To provide variety in this intervention option and limit time spent in a single intervention, components are split into independent modules that either prompt: 1) attainable intention setting related to dietary adherence (e.g., &quot;I will focus on eating mostly fruits/vegetables in my next meal/snack in order to take back control of my eating&quot;); 2) barrier identification for adhering to dietary goals along with a brief problem-solving exercise; 3) devising a small self-reward; OR 4) self-assessment of thoughts/behaviors that could interfere with dietary adherence in the next several hours with coping strategies (e.g., stimulus control, social support).</description>

    <description>To provide variety in this intervention option and limit time spent in a single intervention, components are split into independent modules that either: 1) guide participants in identifying values related to weight control (e.g., longevity, quality of life, being a role model) and connect those values to their behavior in the current moment.; 2) use a collaborative non-judgmental approach to explore the consequences of letting barriers drive behavior (e.g., &quot;Take a moment to consider the effect on your longevity if you let your preference for sweets determine your behavior.&quot;); 3) prompt participants to identify reasons for change, thereby eliciting &quot;change talk&quot;; OR 4) engage participants in a brief self-assessment of motivation for dietary adherence (i.e., &quot;On a scale of 1-10, how important to you is it to stick to your dietary goals today&quot;).</description>

    <description>There are 4 independent modules that prompt self-monitoring and self-awareness efforts: 1) advise participants to record everything that they eat before they eat it, with attention to eating in the subsequent few hours; 2) use the &quot;traffic light&quot; model to enhance awareness of dietary intake. This module provides the traffic light categories of foods (i.e., green=healthiest choices, yellow=sometimes choices, and red=rare choices), and asks participants to check-off foods that they intend to eat vs. stay away from in the next few hours; 3) advise participants to track portion sizes carefully and provide a portion size guide that is available to them until the following EMA survey; OR 4) provide a tutorial on noticing hunger/satiety cues and slowing down rate of eating, with an experiential exercise for use during their next eating episode.</description>

    <description>Participants will be notified that the JITAI algorithm has determined heightened lapse risk in the following 2-3 hours (i.e., &quot;We have detected that your risk of lapsing from your weight loss diet is higher than usual and may require attention.&quot;).</description>

    <intervention_name>Online Behavioral Obesity Treatment</intervention_name>
    <description>The online BOT consists of: (a) 12 weekly multimedia lessons for training in behavioral weight loss skills; (b) online tools for self-monitoring weight, diet, and physical activity; and (c) weekly automated text-based feedback on progress to date. Participants are given a goal of losing 1-2lbs per week to achieve a total weight loss of ≥10% of initial body weight. Participants are prescribed a calorie goal of 1200-1800 kcal/day tailored on initial weight. Participants are given guidelines to follow a lowfat or Mediterranean diet to meet the prescribed calorie goal. Participants are given a physical activity goal tailored on initial activity level that gradually increases to 200 min/wk of activity, emphasizing brisk walking as the primary form of activity. They also receive a primer in self-monitoring weight, diet, and physical activity. Participants are instructed to self-monitor and follow the prescribed diet for the 6-month study period.</description>
