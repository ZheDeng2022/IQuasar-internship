  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Periodontitis defined as destruction of periodontal tissue caused by specific microorganisms&#xD;
      resulting of pocket formation, recession and mobility.Obesity known to increase the host&#xD;
      tolerance by influencing the immune and inflammatory mechanisms in a way that inflammatory&#xD;
      tissue destruction is predisposed and leave a person at high risk of developing&#xD;
      periodontitis.the relationship between periodontitis and obesity has been reported in several&#xD;
      epidemiological and experimental studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obesity can be a higher trigger of chronic stress , stress and how a person copes with stress&#xD;
      has been shown to increase the risk of periodontitis.several studied have shown that&#xD;
      preserving of normal weight by maintaining regular physical exercise is linked with a lower&#xD;
      incidence of periodontitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a matter of truth , overweight and obese individuals are more than twice as likely to have&#xD;
      periodontitis compared to normal healthy persons. It has been suggested that obesity&#xD;
      decreased the blood flow to periodontal tissue, enabling the development of periodontal&#xD;
      disorders. The blood vessels of obese subjects demonstrate a thickening in the inner wall of&#xD;
      arteries that reduce the flow of blood into periodontium. The adipocytes produce various&#xD;
      active molecules called adipokines involving (TNF- α, IL-6, leptin, adiponectin and others).&#xD;
      These compound secrete various molecules of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that lowered&#xD;
      antioxidant enzymes activity like (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione and others).&#xD;
      Thus modulating the effect of adipokines can lower the pathogenicity of periodontitis by&#xD;
      reducing the effect of oxidative stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxidative stress appear to be the main link between obesity and periodontitis and can&#xD;
      aggravates pro-inflammatory pathways frequent in both pathologies. Regarding the significance&#xD;
      of oxidative stress in pathologies of both periodontitis and obesity, several antioxidants&#xD;
      play an amazing role as a preventive and therapeutic measures for both diseases. Multiple&#xD;
      studies had a greater evidence toward melatonin which have an active antioxidant properties ,&#xD;
      which is an indolamine produced mainly by pinealocytes. It has been documented that salivary&#xD;
      melatonin were significantly decreased in patients with periodontal disease, indicated that&#xD;
      melatonin may act as a biomarker for periodontal diagnosis and can be used as a possible&#xD;
      therapeutic agent in various periodontal diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is indicated that adjunctive use of melatonin in combination with non-surgical scaling and&#xD;
      root planning for 3 weeks can lead to improvement of clinical periodontal parameters in&#xD;
      diabetic patients. It was demonstrated that daily dietary supplementation with 3mg melatonin&#xD;
      tablet for 4 weeks along with scaling and root planning significantly reduced the oxidative&#xD;
      stress in periodontitis patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      similarly , significant reduction in gingival inflammation when melatonin administrated&#xD;
      locally as adjunctive measure to standard periodontal therapy. Melatonin promote bone&#xD;
      formation by activating type 1 collagen fibers in osteoblast and enhancing the genetic&#xD;
      expression of bone sialoprotein , alkhaline phosphates, osteopontien and osteocalcine and&#xD;
      downregulate the RANKL mediated osteoclast formation and activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It had been reported that circulatory serum level of melatonin significantly reduced in&#xD;
      obesity .Supplementation of antioxidants in conjunction with other treatment modalities such&#xD;
      as dietary changes, behavioral changes, and drug therapy might be beneficial in treatment of&#xD;
      obesity and associated inflammatory states ., as melatonin participated in homeostasis and&#xD;
      metabolism of energy through activation of brown adipose tissue and enhance energy&#xD;
      expenditure. furthermore, significant reduction in body weight along with adipose tissue&#xD;
      deposit when melatonin were administrated in obese subjects was reported in. Multiple studies&#xD;
      reported that melatonin significantly increase HDL level and decrease TG and HDL level in&#xD;
      addition to increased cholesterol catabolism.&#xD;
