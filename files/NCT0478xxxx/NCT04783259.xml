  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An escape room is a game-like experience, where participants solve a series of logic based&#xD;
      puzzles. Such game-like experiences are being increasingly used in the educations of medical&#xD;
      professionals. With this research project, the researchers aim to explore medical students'&#xD;
      experiences and perceived learning outcome of narrow learning objectives in a medical escape&#xD;
      room experience. The learning experience will be structured with a short lecture, focussed&#xD;
      instructions, a medical escape room scenario and a structured debriefing. The aim is that the&#xD;
      study will create the foundation for general principles for the conduct of medical escape&#xD;
      room experiences.&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current medical students prefer innovative and interactive education styles such as&#xD;
      gamification. Gamification concerns the act of applying game mechanics to a non-gaming&#xD;
      environment, e.g. by putting themes of a clinical situation in the frames of a game. This&#xD;
      concept is being increasingly frequently used in the education of healthcare professionals,&#xD;
      and studies have shown that it appears to be effective to reach the learning outcome. In the&#xD;
      study &quot;Priming healthcare students on the importance of non-technical skills in healthcare:&#xD;
      How to set up a medical escape room game experience&quot; by Rosenkrantz et al. 2019, a medical&#xD;
      escape room was designed to raise awareness about non-technical skills (NTS) among healthcare&#xD;
      professionals. The escape room was named Medical Escape Room Gaming Experience (MERGE). As&#xD;
      with other common escape rooms, MERGE was designed as a game like exercise with puzzles,&#xD;
      which in this room were medical-themed. However, the primary focus is not the medical&#xD;
      technical skills, and thus the puzzles are mainly logic-based with a medical twist. This is&#xD;
      to keep focus on developing NTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Game-like exercises, like MERGE, tend to have a complexity that allows addressing many&#xD;
      different learning goals, depending onto what the attention is guided by the educator. In the&#xD;
      researchers' experience, often a broad learning goal is initiated by a rather general&#xD;
      instruction to pay attention e.g. to the &quot;non-technical skills&quot; or to &quot;communication&quot;. This&#xD;
      enables many possible discussions, also taking the interest of participants into account. The&#xD;
      downside can be that the discussion might be superficial and erratic, as conflicting&#xD;
      interests in the group might lead to frequent changes in topics. Another approach is to&#xD;
      specify some narrow learning objectives in more detail, e.g. &quot;identify the different sources&#xD;
      of information&quot;, directing the discussion on very specific aspects of the scenario. This&#xD;
      entails that potentially a lot of interesting elements remain uncovered, and that&#xD;
      participants might not get the chance to discuss what they think is most important for them.&#xD;
      On the other hand, the discussion of the learning objectives can reach deeper reflection&#xD;
      levels, as fewer topics need to be covered and as less time is used to coordinate what should&#xD;
      be discussed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rosenkrantz et al. and several others have proposed that the participants of an escape rooms&#xD;
      experiences may achieve a greater learning outcome if they are debriefed by a trained&#xD;
      professional after participating in the escape room. The trained debriefer can also be a peer&#xD;
      to the learners. Peer-to-peer feedback is suggested to have a positive effect on learning&#xD;
      outcome. Debriefing can be defined as the act of reviewing critical actions that unfolded&#xD;
      during the course of a simulation scenario, and in its form, it is conversational,&#xD;
      bidirectional, interactive, and reflective. Debriefing is known to enhance the learning&#xD;
      outcome by allowing for reflection on educational experiences. Several experiments with&#xD;
      debriefing after medical escape rooms have been carried out in the last few years. However,&#xD;
      only the studies by Friedrich et al. and the two studies by Zhang et al. had the aspect of&#xD;
      debriefing as a point of focus. In these three studies, the participants answered different&#xD;
      questionnaires, where some of the questions regarded the debriefing. All three studies&#xD;
      concluded that the participants appreciated the post-escape room debriefing. In addition, the&#xD;
      studies by Zhang et al. concluded that the participants would have preferred a more&#xD;
      structured debriefing session to help them analyse aspects of communication and&#xD;
      problem-solving. All of the aforementioned studies with post-escape room debriefing had broad&#xD;
      learning objectives primarily concerning communication. No studies concerning medical escape&#xD;
      rooms have evaluated the use of narrow learning objectives in a medical escape room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this research project, the researchers aim to explore the participants' experiences and&#xD;
      perceived learning outcome of narrow learning objectives in a medical escape room experience.&#xD;
      The learning experience will be structured with a short lecture, focussed instructions, the&#xD;
      MERGE scenario and a structured debriefing. The aim is that the study will create the&#xD;
      foundation for general principles for the conduct of medical escape room experiences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an explorative qualitative intervention study. A qualitative, summarising approach is&#xD;
      used to analyse responses to the intervention. We will achieve this by exploring&#xD;
      participants' experiences shortly after they have undergone a structured post-escape room&#xD;
      debriefing. The aforementioned escape room, MERGE, will be conducted with teams of medical&#xD;
      students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the escape room begins, the participants will participate in a brief video recorded&#xD;
      lecture by a medical student concerning the learning objectives. Afterwards, the facilitator&#xD;
      will brief the participants about the voluntary nature of their participation in the study,&#xD;
      and the learning objectives of the escape room. These measures are thought to establish a&#xD;
      common ground for the discussion in the debriefing. When the participants have finished the&#xD;
      escape room by completing all the riddles, they will be taken to an adjacent room. Here, an&#xD;
      educator, a person other than the facilitator, will debrief them. The debriefing will follow&#xD;
      a manual, but the educator will have observed the participants through the see-through mirror&#xD;
      in order to guide the group in their individual debriefing. Afterwards, the educator will&#xD;
      leave, and an interviewer will join the group and ask them a series of standardised questions&#xD;
      regarding the escape room gaming experience and the following debriefing. Lastly, the&#xD;
      participants will answer a questionnaire regarding, age, gender, and their experience related&#xD;
      to simulation, debriefing, etc. As all the participants will be Danish speaking, the language&#xD;
      for both the escape room, the debriefing, the interview and the questionnaire will be in&#xD;
      Danish.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants and sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants of this study will be medical students who have completed the fourth year of&#xD;
      their studies at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark (UCPH). At this point in their&#xD;
      studies, they have completed four months of internship, experiencing the clinical practice of&#xD;
      young doctors. As a group, they have little experience with simulation, but everyone will&#xD;
      have tried it a few times. The recruitment of the participants will be executed by posting a&#xD;
      notice on a social media platform, including the vast majority of medical students at UCPH.&#xD;
      The participants are to apply as premade groups of four to five people, and the applicants&#xD;
      will be chosen based on the order in which they apply.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal is to conduct eight to ten sessions of the escape room with groups of four to five&#xD;
      participants each, and participants will only be allowed to participate once. The study group&#xD;
      estimates that this is the number of simulations required to receive sufficient qualitative&#xD;
      data. The researchers will check for data saturation during the analysis, which they expect&#xD;
      will be reached after about six sessions. In case saturation is not reached after all ten&#xD;
      sessions, further sessions will be conducted until saturation is reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention in this study is a structured experiential learning session including a&#xD;
      short video lecture, focussed instructions, the MERGE scenario, and a structured standardized&#xD;
      four-layered post session debriefing with narrow learning objectives. The video lecture will&#xD;
      concern the learning objectives and will be developed within the research team and recorded&#xD;
      with a medical student delivering it. Also the focussed instructions will be developed within&#xD;
      the research team and delivered by the facilitator, who also conducts the MERGE session. The&#xD;
      debriefing of the participants will be a semi-structured conversation lead by an educator.&#xD;
      The educator will be a medical student practical experience in peer-to-peer debriefing of&#xD;
      medical students after medical simulations. The debriefing will have a narrow focus, revolved&#xD;
      around two learning objectives. Rosenkrantz et al. 2019 suggested that the NTS concerning&#xD;
      information gathering and exchange are the most viable of being focus points in the MERGE.&#xD;
      Therefore, the learning objectives of focus in the debriefing will be: &quot;Recognising the&#xD;
      different ways of exchanging information&quot; and &quot;Discussing the impact of exchanging&#xD;
      information on problem-solving&quot;. These learning objectives are designed to explore the&#xD;
      exchange of information on several of Bloom's taxonomical levels. The first learning&#xD;
      objective concerns knowledge and comprehension, and the second concerns application and&#xD;
      analysis. The educator will guide the conversation using the manual shown below. The manual&#xD;
      follows the common four-phase debriefing model inspired by Steinwach 1992 and PEARLS. First,&#xD;
      the educator sets the scene by explaining the course of the debriefing. The debriefing then&#xD;
      starts with a reaction phase, where the participants are encouraged to express their feelings&#xD;
      and ask any technical questions they may have regarding the escape room. This is followed by&#xD;
      a focused description phase, where the participants discuss the first learning objective by&#xD;
      describing the different ways they exchanged information during the escape room. Hereafter&#xD;
      comes the analysis phase, during which the second learning objective concerning the impact of&#xD;
      exchanging information is explored and discussed. Lastly, the debriefing is rounded off in&#xD;
      the application phase, where the participants transfer the events of the simulation to&#xD;
      clinical practice and sum up the key learning points. As the debriefing is a semi-structured&#xD;
      conversation, the manual is not expected to be followed meticulously regarding the order of&#xD;
      the points. However, all the points must be covered, and the overall structure with the four&#xD;
      phases should be maintained in all concerns.&#xD;

      0. Setting the scene (2 min)&#xD;
&#xD;
      • &quot;In this debriefing, we are going to reflect on your experiences. It will take about 45&#xD;
      minutes. We will first discuss shortly, what happened in the escape room. Then we are all&#xD;
      going to reflect on how you shared information. Lastly, we will look at what you can take&#xD;
      with you.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Reaction&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  &quot;How are each of you feeling right now?&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  &quot;Are you sitting with any technical questions about the riddles or the escape room&#xD;
                in general at this moment?&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  &quot;Now then, having answered your questions, I am going to continue with the&#xD;
                debriefing.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Description&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  &quot;We are - in this debriefing - especially interested in how you shared information&#xD;
                with each other. We could discuss many things, but we would like to focus on this&#xD;
                aspect.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  &quot;I want each of you to answer the question: 'What were the different ways you used&#xD;
                to exchange information?' I want you to describe how you did it in as much detail&#xD;
                as possible.&quot; Start with one and then ask the others for additions. Consider taking&#xD;
                notes that all can see.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If you noticed any additional examples of information exchange, lead their&#xD;
                attention to it and make them describe it by saying something like: &quot;I also noticed&#xD;
                a point where … can you elaborate what happened there?&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  &quot;What went well in today's game in regards to the exchange of information, and how&#xD;
                did it affect your performance in the escape room?&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  &quot;How and why would the progression have been different if you had not been allowed&#xD;
                to talk to each other?&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  &quot;Were there phases of the escape room, where the exchange of information was more&#xD;
                or less important? Please elaborate.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  &quot;Did you experience any situations where you found it difficult to exchange&#xD;
                information with a member of your team? When and why?&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  &quot;How could you have optimised your exchange of information?&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Application&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  &quot;How can the things you learned today be applied in your clinical practice?&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  &quot;Lastly, I want each of you to mention the most important thing that you learned&#xD;
                from today's events.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of the intervention: Semi-structured interviews&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interview of the participants will be a semi-structured group interview concerning the&#xD;
      participants' perceived value of medical escape rooms and the following debriefing, and their&#xD;
      opinions about the narrow learning objectives. The interview will follow the questions shown&#xD;
      below. The interview will be video and audio recorded as material for the following analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questions&#xD;
&#xD;
      The escape room&#xD;
&#xD;
      • &quot;How was your experience with the escape room? Is there anything you want to emphasise?&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      The debriefing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &quot;What do you think about the debriefing?&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &quot;What are the pros and cons of a structured debriefing like you had versus a different&#xD;
           format, e.g. an unstructured conversation?&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &quot;Would you have preferred that the format had been less structured? Why/ why not?&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &quot;How do you feel about the very narrow focus of the debriefing, i.e. the exchange of&#xD;
           information?&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &quot;Were there any topics that you wanted to discuss, but couldn't due to the narrow&#xD;
           learning objective?&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &quot;Would you rather have had more time to discuss certain aspects?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After your considerations in this interview, I ask again: what do you think about the&#xD;
           debriefing?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The learning outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &quot;When during the escape room and/or debriefing do you feel that you learned something&#xD;
           concerning exchange of information?&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &quot;Did you learn anything besides exchange of information? What and when?&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &quot;Do you experience that the debriefing has affected your learning outcome today? How and&#xD;
           why?&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of debriefings and interviews&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interviews will provide data for analysis in the form of video and audio recordings.&#xD;
      These data will be analysed using systematic text condensation. First, the recordings of the&#xD;
      interviews from the first six escape rooms will be transcribed. These transcripts will then&#xD;
      be coded in a condensating fashion and any relevant key points will be identified.&#xD;
      Afterwards, the researchers will watch the recordings of the remaining interviews, focusing&#xD;
      on whether they provide any new inputs or whether saturation has been achieved. Any of these&#xD;
      will then be transcribed and coded as well, should they provide new inputs. The codes will be&#xD;
      grouped in order to create themes, which will then be labelled by their common denominator.&#xD;
      The themes and their connections will be described and discussed. Based on this discussion,&#xD;
      the researchers will conclude how participants experience the learning setting and what kind&#xD;
      of learning outcome they perceive. Based on the analysis of the participants' experiences,&#xD;
      general principles for the conduct of medical escape room experiences will be derived.&#xD;
