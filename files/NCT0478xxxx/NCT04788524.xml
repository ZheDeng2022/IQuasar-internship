  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lack of perceived control, particularly during stress, has been critically implicated in&#xD;
      major depressive disorder (MDD) and anhedonic symptoms, especially among female adolescents;&#xD;
      yet the neural underpinnings of perceived control disruptions in MDD remain poorly&#xD;
      understood. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging with a novel &quot;value of control task&quot;&#xD;
      in conjunction with a prospective design, this study will provide a comprehensive&#xD;
      understanding of stress and perceived control related mechanisms in female adolescents with&#xD;
      MDD and will examine stress-induced disruptions in perceived control as a predictor of &quot;real&#xD;
      world&quot; expressions of maladaptive coping and anhedonia.&#xD;

      Participants in this research will include 40 female adolescents, aged 14-18, with Major&#xD;
      Depressive Disorder (MDD) and 40 healthy adolescents from the greater Boston area by Dr.&#xD;
      Emily Belleau, at McLean Hospital's Center for Depression, Anxiety and Stress Research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include four sessions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A clinical diagnostic interview as well as filling out a series of questionnaires and&#xD;
           assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The second session will include a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) brain&#xD;
           scan to be conducted at the McLean Hospital Imaging Center. Participants will be asked&#xD;
           to respond to surveys on their cell phone in the week following the fMRI brain scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The third session will include a diagnostic interview, assessments, and questionnaires&#xD;
           to be completed three-months after the fMRI brain scan. Participants will be asked to&#xD;
           complete surveys on their cell phone during the week following this three month&#xD;
           follow-up session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The fourth session will include a diagnostic interview, assessments, and questionnaires&#xD;
           to be completed six-months after the fMRI brain scan. Participants will be asked to&#xD;
           complete surveys on their cell phone during the week following this six month follow-up&#xD;
           session.&#xD;
