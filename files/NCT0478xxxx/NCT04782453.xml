  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tobacco use is associated with high mortality, and a range of morbidities including cancer,&#xD;
      and lung and cardiovascular diseases. Furthermore, tobacco users who die prematurely deprive&#xD;
      their families of income, raise the cost of health care and hinder economic development.&#xD;
      India is the second-largest consumer (current use-48% males, 20% females; 275 million adults)&#xD;
      and third largest producer of tobacco in the world5; and has one of the highest mortality&#xD;
      related to tobacco. The treatment gap for tobacco use in India is as high as 92%.&#xD;
      Opportunistic screening and brief interventions in primary care, although recommended by the&#xD;
      World Health Organization (WHO), is largely missing in current practice in India.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The existing tobacco cessation strategy in India has shown limited success due to poor&#xD;
      availability and accessibility of tobacco cessation services, and non-availability of&#xD;
      interventions that are culturally relevant and contextual to the target population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary formative research as a part of the larger ToQuit study has informed the&#xD;
      development of the first version of the treatment package. This first version of the package&#xD;
      was tested through a case series, by refining the intervention content and delivery&#xD;
      mechanisms through an iterative process, to develop the final intervention. This pilot&#xD;
      Randomised Control Trial (RCT) will aim to empirically evaluate the feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of the mobile-based brief intervention (BI) for tobacco use, generate&#xD;
      preliminary estimates of the impact of the BI, and fine-tune the procedures for a definitive&#xD;
      RCT.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ToQuit study aims to overcome the accessibility and feasibility hurdles by developing and&#xD;
      evaluating a tobacco-cessation intervention that can be delivered using low cost and easily&#xD;
      available mobile text messaging. India has 1.2 billion mobile phone subscriptions&#xD;
      (tele-density 92%) and this provides a unique opportunity to significantly increase the&#xD;
      penetration and coverage of tobacco cessation interventions in a low health-resource setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot Randomised Control Trial (RCT) will aim to empirically evaluate the feasibility&#xD;
      and acceptability of the mobile-based brief intervention (BI) for tobacco use, generate&#xD;
      preliminary estimates of the impact of the BI, and fine-tune the procedures for a definitive&#xD;
      RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol will serve as a research framework for the implementation of the proposed pilot&#xD;
      RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To test and refine procedures for a definitive RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the feasibility and acceptability of delivering the mobile-based BI for&#xD;
           tobacco use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To refine the mobile-based BI package for a definitive RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To assess the impact of the mobile-based BI on tobacco use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To inform sample size calculations for the definitive RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study recruitment will be conducted online and hence participants will include any&#xD;
      eligible individual residing in India.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will include a sample of 100 participants, 50 each in the intervention and control groups.&#xD;
      This sample size estimates are based on our previous experiences of pilot RCTs and deemed&#xD;
      sufficient to achieve the goals of understanding the acceptability, feasibility, and&#xD;
      preliminary impact of an intervention. The sample size of 80 enrolled tobacco users randomly&#xD;
      allocated with a 1:1 allocation ratio, with 5% type I error and 6% abstinence in the control&#xD;
      arm at follow up would provide 80% statistical power to detect an effect of 5.3 (relative&#xD;
      risk) for abstinence in favour of ToQuit intervention.11 Considering a 20% loss rate during&#xD;
      the follow-up period as per our experience in case series, the total sample of 100&#xD;
      participants would be needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment sources:&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ The recruitment advertisements will be shared over the social media accounts of Sangath&#xD;
      India (an organization where all the research staff is based) and contacts of the&#xD;
      researchers. We will also display advertisement posters in the public health facilities and&#xD;
      dental clinics in Goa state and at public places such as village panchayats, supermarkets&#xD;
      etc. The individuals willing to quit tobacco will be asked to send 'ToQuit' message on the&#xD;
      designated mobile number.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gatekeepers such as Anganwadi (community-based integrated child development services&#xD;
           delivery centres in India) workers , local panchayat leaders, Accredited social health&#xD;
           activist (ASHA) workers: The researchers will build awareness about the project in the&#xD;
           community and seek assistance from community gatekeepers. Gatekeepers would:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Refer patients to the researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Inform people in the community about ToQuit, and ask them to contact ToQuit&#xD;
                researchers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical officer (MO) at primary health centres (PHC)/dentists at district hospital (DH)&#xD;
           and private dental clinics: The PHC MO and dentists at DH and private clinics will be&#xD;
           informed about the study and will be requested to refer patients who are using tobacco&#xD;
           to the researchers for screening. Project team will leave calling cards with them to&#xD;
           handout to the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
      When a 'ToQuit' message is received from a potential participant, one of the researchers will&#xD;
      call on the mobile number and inform them about the study. If the respondent is willing to&#xD;
      participate, researcher will proceed with initial screening for eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tobacco users who do not fulfil the eligibility criteria will be thanked for their time, and&#xD;
      will be suggested to seek help from a general practitioner, primary health centre, or a&#xD;
      tobacco cessation clinic (TCC) in their area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consenting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants who fulfill all the eligibility criteria will be given information&#xD;
      about their participation in the study. Each potential participant will also be taken through&#xD;
      the informed consent process and will be requested to provide written consent to participate&#xD;
      in the study. The study researcher will ensure that any questions/queries the participant may&#xD;
      have about the intervention are resolved before the participant provides their consent. All&#xD;
      consent procedures will be audio-recorded with the permission of the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When done remotely, if accessible to the potential participant, a researcher will send the&#xD;
      information sheet and consent form via email/WhatsApp messaging app. If the potential&#xD;
      participant does not have access to these, then the researcher will read out the information&#xD;
      sheet before the screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respondents who do not consent to participate in the study will be requested to give minimal&#xD;
      sociodemographic data (age, gender, educational status, employment status, marital status),&#xD;
      to examine whether there is a systematic difference between those who consent and those who&#xD;
      do not. Reason for refusal will be recorded. They will be thanked for their time and will be&#xD;
      suggested to seek help from a general practitioner, primary health centre, or a TCC in their&#xD;
      area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline measures administered to consenting participants will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sociodemographic data:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data about potential confounders such as age, gender, employment status, educational&#xD;
           status, and marital status will be collected through a socio-demographic form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Tobacco use:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of tobacco used to understand if there are any differences in outcomes in smokers and&#xD;
      smokeless tobacco users.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. The Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST): Participants will&#xD;
      then be administered the 6 questions about tobacco use from the ASSIST tool. The ASSIST is&#xD;
      the screening test which covers all psychoactive substances including alcohol, tobacco and&#xD;
      illicit drugs, and can help identify individuals who may have hazardous, harmful or dependent&#xD;
      use of one or more substance.12 ASSIST has shown good concurrent, construct, predictive and&#xD;
      discriminative validity to be used in India. It has good reliability and feasibility in&#xD;
      culturally diverse settings and with different substance use patterns.13 3. Information&#xD;
      required for delivery of intervention The participant will be asked the questions related to&#xD;
      intervention delivery such as preferred days and time, and preferred language to send the&#xD;
      intervention messages. The researcher will inform the participant about tentative schedule of&#xD;
      receiving messages and end the call.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be stratified in two groups, smokeless tobacco users and smokers.&#xD;
      Consenting eligible participants in both these strata will be randomly allocated to&#xD;
      intervention or control group, in 1:1 ratio. An independent data manager will generate a&#xD;
      randomisation list and participants will be randomised using Sequentially Numbered Opaque&#xD;
      Sealed Envelopes to maximise allocation concealment. Consenting eligible participants'&#xD;
      contact numbers will be added to the intervention database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants from the ToQuit intervention arm will receive the messages on their mobile phone&#xD;
      for 8 weeks. The intervention messages will consist of specific content areas derived from&#xD;
      the formative research of the study. Some of the components of the intervention include:&#xD;
      Psychoeducation about consequences of tobacco use and benefits of quitting; goal setting;&#xD;
      managing goals and self-monitoring of behaviour; avoidance strategies; self-awareness and&#xD;
      reflection messages; social and pharmacological support, help-seeking; identifying and&#xD;
      managing cravings; and relapse prevention strategies. The messages will be sent for 3-4 days&#xD;
      a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants from the control group will be sent the details of other functional tobacco&#xD;
      helplines in India.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nested qualitative study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative outcome interviews will be conducted with a sub-sample of participants from the&#xD;
      intervention group to gain insight into the impact of the mobile-based BI on the tobacco use.&#xD;
      We will purposively select those who report abstinence and those who do not report&#xD;
      abstinence. An interview guide will be developed focused on understanding the acceptability,&#xD;
      feasibility, and perceived impact of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Quantitative- Quantitative outcome data will be analysed using STATA 16, consistent with&#xD;
      CONSORT guidelines for parallel randomized controlled trials. The process indicators will be&#xD;
      presented using a trial flow chart.14 Baseline characteristics of participants with respect&#xD;
      to consented and not consented, outcome assessments completed and not completed, and&#xD;
      differences between intervention and the control arms, will be presented as proportions or&#xD;
      means as appropriate. For primary analysis, complete case analysis will be conducted,&#xD;
      adjusted for baseline variables with imbalance, if any. Secondary analysis will be&#xD;
      intention-to-treat at the 3 month end-point regardless of treatment adherence. Regression&#xD;
      analysis will be conducted for the treatment outcomes. Effect size will be reported as odds&#xD;
      ratio with 95% confidence interval for the primary outcome, between intervention and control&#xD;
      group. Standardized mean differences with 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for&#xD;
      ASSIST scores of the two arms, and changes in scores from baseline and follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Missing outcome data will be imputed using mean imputation or multiple imputation.&#xD;
      Sensitivity analysis will be conducted assuming data missing at random, and outcome groups&#xD;
      will be compared by replacing missing values with 'abstinence achieved' as 'best case&#xD;
      scenario' and by failure to achieve the abstinence as 'worst case scenario'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Qualitative- Thematic analysis will be used to analyse the qualitative data from the&#xD;
      outcome interviews, using N-vivo version 12.15 Analysis will involve generation of codes from&#xD;
      raw data. Themes will be derived by retrieving pieces of data pertaining to codes and by&#xD;
      examining their meaning in relation to the research questions (acceptability of the content&#xD;
      and delivery of the mobile-based intervention, barriers to engagement, impact on tobacco&#xD;
      use).&#xD;
