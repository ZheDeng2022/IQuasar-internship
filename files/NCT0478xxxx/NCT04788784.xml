  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HIV Treatment simplification strategies that involve switching cART regimens from four or&#xD;
      three antiretrovirals to two in virologically suppressed patients living with HIV are now&#xD;
      available in order to reduce long-term toxicity and enhance treatment adherence. Dolutegravir&#xD;
      is a second-generation integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) with noticeable&#xD;
      advantages, including a high genetic barrier to drug resistance, once-daily dosing and lower&#xD;
      risk of drug-drug interactions because this agent does not inhibit or induce cytochrome P450&#xD;
      isoenzymes or P-glycoprotein transporters. Dolutegravir is generally well tolerated and the&#xD;
      INSTI class is considered to be more &quot;metabolically friendly&quot; compared with other drug&#xD;
      classes such as protease inhibitors (PIs). Thus, the combination of dolutegravir plus a&#xD;
      second active agent is a particularly inviting option for maintenance treatment and research&#xD;
      in this area is evolving. However, though safety and efficacy of dolutegravir are well known,&#xD;
      there is no study evaluating patient-reported outcomes (PROs), i.e. subjective and&#xD;
      self-reported measures of the patient's health perception. In an era of the efficacy of HIV&#xD;
      regimens are more and more comparable, the main discriminant criteria to choose the best&#xD;
      treatment option are now adherence and self-reported measures of a patient's health - termed&#xD;
      &quot;patient-reported outcomes&quot; (PROs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study, based on a mixed methodology, include a qualitative part and a quantitative part.&#xD;
      The qualitative study will explore patients' and health care professionals' perceptions,&#xD;
      knowledge, and representations of triple or quadruple and dual therapies and detect the&#xD;
      degree of agreement or disagreement between patients' and practitioners' perspectives. The&#xD;
      quantitative study's main objective is to measure the Dovato regimen's impact on a patient's&#xD;
      perception (Patient-Reported Outcomes - PRO) on acceptability, toxicity, preference, and&#xD;
      Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQL). PRO are collected through self-administered&#xD;
      questionnaires at D0 (when the patient switch treatment), M1 and M6.&#xD;
