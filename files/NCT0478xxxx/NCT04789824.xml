      Dry eye is one of the most common eye diseases and it is known to be an ever-increasing&#xD;
      public health problem in risky groups. Physical conditions (heat, light,&#xD;
      humidity,ventilation), anesthetic gases, chemical-containing disinfectants and antiseptics&#xD;
      are risk factors for dry eyes in operating rooms. In addition, the fact that surgery is a job&#xD;
      that requires constant attention is considered among the factors that increase the risk of&#xD;
      dry eye as it reduces the number of blinking. In the literature review, eye hygiene (hot&#xD;
      application, massage, cleaning) is recommended as an application that protects and improves&#xD;
      eye health. Because it has been reported to have significant positive effects on eye fatigue,&#xD;
      dry eye symptoms and vision in both healthy and dry eyes. However, &quot;daily eye hygiene&quot; is a&#xD;
      little-known practice in almost every society. In this context, the effect of eye hygiene on&#xD;
      ocular surface moistening and vision-related quality of life in operating room workers was&#xD;
      investigated in this study.The research was conducted as a randomized controlled experimental&#xD;
      study between May 2018 and May 2019. All participants working in the operating room and&#xD;
      meeting the inclusion criteria were included in the study. The group in which the&#xD;
      participants will be included was determined by simple randomization. Eye hygiene training&#xD;
      was given to the intervention group and eye hygiene practice was followed for 12 weeks. The&#xD;
      control group was not intervened. Tear film stability and vision-related quality of life&#xD;
      scores of both groups before and after 12 weeks of training were compared.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Dry eye disease is one of the most common pathologies of the ocular surface which is&#xD;
      characterized by tear film instability due to insufficient tear production or increased&#xD;
      evaporation. Its prevalence varies between 5 to 50% in adults and may increase up to 75% in&#xD;
      individuals aged above 40 years. This disease affects women twice as often as men. Dry eye&#xD;
      poses burden on patients, due to associated symptoms that may widely range from persistent&#xD;
      pain, itching, burning, stinging or scratchy and foreign body sensation, and light&#xD;
      sensitivity to blurred vision, corneal epithelial defects, and ulcerations in the chronic&#xD;
      state. In particular, in moderate-to-severe cases, pain, limitations in the daily living&#xD;
      activities, and reduced quality of life are associated with depression, mood and sleep&#xD;
      disorders. There are many factors proposed to play a role in the etiology of the disease:&#xD;
      lifestyle habits, low humidity and artificial indoor heating and air conditioning systems,&#xD;
      environmental factors such as air pollution containing chemical, physical, and biological&#xD;
      pollutants, visual tasks requiring long-term mental focus, prolonged exposure to computer or&#xD;
      smart phones, and occupational and personal habits that decrease the eyeblink frequency and&#xD;
      increase the ocular evaporation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The operating rooms are specially designed for multi-modality use and contain a number of&#xD;
      environmental pollutants for the ocular surface associated with the physical environment and&#xD;
      occupational and personal habits of healthcare providers. Surgery itself being a critical&#xD;
      task demanding long-term mental focus, air conditioning, constant humidity, constant room&#xD;
      temperature, intense lighting, irritant chemicals, surgical smoke, anesthetic gases, and&#xD;
      biological aerosols are predisposing factors for ocular irritation in operating room staff. A&#xD;
      few studies demonstrated that the risk of dry eye disease is higher in operating room staff,&#xD;
      intensive care nursing and laboratory technicians. Castellanos-González et al. reported that&#xD;
      their presence in the operating room predisposed surgical residents to have dry eye syndrome&#xD;
      due to environmental conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the best of our knowledge, there is no study investigating the effectiveness of proper&#xD;
      eyelid hygiene in dry eye disease among operating room staff., occupational activities with a&#xD;
      high level of visual burden, and working environment. Dry eye disease is a chronic and&#xD;
      progressive condition. Treatment provides symptomatic relief; however, cure is seen in only a&#xD;
      small fraction of patients. The 2017 Tear Film and Ocular Surface Society (TFOS) revisited&#xD;
      the management and treatment of dry eye disease in a two-step model. Accordingly, in the&#xD;
      first step, non-pharmacological methods such as education about the disease and its&#xD;
      management, modification of local environment, dietary changes, increasing fluid intake,&#xD;
      enhanced blinking behavior, and proper eyelid hygiene are recommended. Based on these&#xD;
      recommendations, eyelid hygiene regimen consisting of warm compress, lid massage, and eye&#xD;
      cleaning is a supportive and rehabilitative approach. Also, studies have revealed that have&#xD;
      also demonstrated the favorable effects of daily eyelid hygiene consisting of warm compress,&#xD;
      lid massage, and cleaning on eye fatigue, dry eye symptoms, and visual acuity and recommended&#xD;
      this regimen as a preventive medicine and health promotion. Warm compress and mechanical lid&#xD;
      massage induce the meibomian secretion (i.e., the tear film lipid layer is mostly (90%)&#xD;
      derived from the meibomian oil secreted by the meibomian glands), while eye cleaning provides&#xD;
      protein/lipid deposits around the eyelashes and eyelids and eliminates microbial agents such&#xD;
      as Staphylococci and Demodex spp.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have confirmed the increased the secretion of meibomian lipids that are&#xD;
      pathologically altered with warm compress, the outcomes may vary depending on the duration of&#xD;
      application, degree of heat, and patient compliance. It have shown that the mean temperature&#xD;
      ranges between 37.7±0.3 and 41.6±1.0°C and the ideal temperature is 40 to 45°C for warm&#xD;
      compress. Once the meibomian secretions are liquefied with warm compress, the main goal of&#xD;
      lid massage is to reduce the clogging of the meibomian gland and to maintain sufficient&#xD;
      drainage of the tears. Following eyelid warming for minimum four min once or twice daily,&#xD;
      medium-to-intense eyelid massage has been shown to induce expression of the meibomian gland&#xD;
      secretions. With similar effects to mechanical finger massage, intense pulsed light to the&#xD;
      eyelid, high-frequency electrotherapy, meibomian gland compressors, and eye massagers with&#xD;
      heat-vibration have been also utilized in studies. Previous studies have confirmed that eye&#xD;
      clean is an effective approach to prevent meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) and Demodex&#xD;
      mites. The most common used eye clean regimens include warm water in a washcloth, soaked&#xD;
      cloths, cotton pads, or cotton tipped applicators, and gentle rubbing with baby shampoo,&#xD;
      alone or combined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, we, for the first time, aimed to evaluate the impact of eyelid hygiene&#xD;
      on tear film stability, ocular symptoms, and vision-related quality of life among operating&#xD;
      room staff with Stage ≥I dry eye disease.&#xD;
