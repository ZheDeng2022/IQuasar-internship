  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is a randomized, double blind, controlled pilot study that will compare bilateral&#xD;
      theta burst stimulation (TBS) and sham treatment for patients with opioid use disorder (OUD)&#xD;
      and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) experiencing suicidality.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex&#xD;
      (DLPFC) is used therapeutically in major depressive disorder resistant to standard&#xD;
      treatments, and recently also shown to be effective in reducing suicidality with a bilateral&#xD;
      approach. Recently, a new form of rTMS has been developed called theta burst stimulation&#xD;
      (TBS) which requires a much shorter daily treatment duration and has been found to be&#xD;
      non-inferior to standard rTMS. The investigators propose to conduct a randomized controlled&#xD;
      clinical trial of a daily, 20 session course of bilateral TBS versus sham stimulation in the&#xD;
      treatment of suicidality in patients with OUD and MDD. The investigators will explore whether&#xD;
      TBS can have other clinical effects on decreasing symptoms of MDD, craving for opioids, and&#xD;
      rates of relapse to opioid use. The investigators will also examine whether rTMS can engage&#xD;
      GABA mediated inhibition using combined transcranial magnetic stimulation and&#xD;
      electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) will be assessed before and after intervention. Clinical&#xD;
      outcomes measured before, during, at end of treatment, and 4-weeks post treatment.&#xD;
