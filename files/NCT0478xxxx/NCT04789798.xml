  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The direct and indirect costs of treating diabetes are high. 10-15% of the health budgets of&#xD;
      many countries are spent on diabetes treatment. Most of these expenses are due to the&#xD;
      treatment and follow-up costs of complications seen in patients who are not well monitored&#xD;
      and whose metabolic control is not achieved. the rapid increase in diabetes causes polyclinic&#xD;
      and hospital services to become more intense. Despite the increasing number of patients, both&#xD;
      performance and due to non-physician occupational groups' insufficiency (Diabetes Dietician,&#xD;
      Diabetes Nurse), patients can only be given an appointment once a year, and patients cannot&#xD;
      be allocated sufficient time during the appointment. Since these problems are valid&#xD;
      worldwide, Telemedicine programs are designed to provide easy, cheap, and practical follow-up&#xD;
      and treatment of many chronic diseases in various states of the USA and many developed&#xD;
      European countries.&#xD;

      The project is designed as a randomized controlled trial with approximately 100 subjects&#xD;
      receiving a telemedicine intervention and approximately 100 receiving usual care. Eligibility&#xD;
      requires having diabetes and being a Medicare beneficiary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This program, called &quot;TeleDiab&quot; for the first time in our country, was designed in&#xD;
      cooperation with the Istanbul University Rectorate and the local telecommunication company&#xD;
      Turkcell. Its implementation was carried out as a pilot project in the Department of&#xD;
      Endocrinology and Metabolic Diseases of Istanbul Medical Faculty in the follow-up and&#xD;
      treatment of diabetic patients. Subjects are randomized to receive telemedicine case&#xD;
      management or usual care for diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project, it is aimed to evaluate the &quot;TeleDiab&quot; program developed for use in diabetic&#xD;
      patients in terms of applicability, practicality, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness. In&#xD;
      this way, it was aimed to compare the electronically followed patient group with a similar&#xD;
      patient group routinely followed in terms of glycemic control, treatment compliance,&#xD;
      complications, and comorbid diseases 6 months and 1 year later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention utilizes a home telemedicine unit (HTU). The HTU is a specially designed,&#xD;
      web-enabled device with a data port connected to a home glucometer and home blood pressure&#xD;
      cuff whereby measurements obtained with these devices can be directly uploaded to a computer&#xD;
      database. A diabetes nurse and a practitioner case manager interact regularly with&#xD;
      intervention participants through videoconference via the HTU.&#xD;
