      Periodontitis may contribute to vascular damage, resulting in the destabilization of&#xD;
      atherosclerotic plaque leading to acute coronary syndrome (ACS). In this study, we explored&#xD;
      the effect of non-surgical periodontal treatment (NSPT) on cardiovascular blood biomarkers&#xD;
      and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) Neutrophil Elastase (NE) and α1-proteinase inhibitor&#xD;
      (alpha-1PI) levels in periodontitis (P) participants with and without ACS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical and dental examinations were performed to diagnose ACS and periodontitis,&#xD;
      respectively. Seventeen patients with diagnosis ACS and periodontitis were included in this&#xD;
      study, as a test group (Group ACS). Twenty-six, age and sex-matched control patients with&#xD;
      periodontitis (Group P) were otherwise systemically healthy. Both groups received NSPT.&#xD;
      Plasma levels of cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density&#xD;
      lipoprotein (LDL), C-reactive protein (CRP), GCF NE activity, and GCF α1-PI levels were&#xD;
      measured baseline, at1st and 3rd months after NSPT.&#xD;

      This research was approved by the human participants ethics board of Selcuk University&#xD;
      Faculty of Dentistry (project number=301) and was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki&#xD;
      Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2013. Informed consent was obtained from patients prior to&#xD;
      oral diagnostic examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria for ACS group :&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Patients diagnosed with both ACS and localized or generalized periodontitis of stage II or&#xD;
      III with grade B or C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of ACS was performed by a consultant cardiologist based on clinical signs and&#xD;
      symptoms of cardiac ischemia, cardiac enzyme levels, changes in electrocardiography, and&#xD;
      results of echocardiography and coronary angiography, according to the guidelines of American&#xD;
      College of Cardiology/American Heart Association . The test group of ACS patients myocardial&#xD;
      infarction (NSTEMI), and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) were hospitalized&#xD;
      in Selcuk University Meram Medical Faculty Department of Cardiology (Konya/Turkey).Unstable&#xD;
      angina (UA) was defined as the new onset or a changed pattern of angina over the past 2&#xD;
      months and Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) class IV angina at the time of presentation&#xD;
      coinciding with appropriate objective evidence of myocardial ischemia on an electrocardiogram&#xD;
      (ECG) or myocardial perfusion imaging. ACS with ST-segment elevation was defined as AMI&#xD;
      characterized by: chest pain, radiating or not to the upper extremities, lower jaw, upper&#xD;
      back or epigastrium lasting 30 minutes or more, associated or not with sweating, nausea or&#xD;
      pallor; presence of ST-segment elevation of 1 mm in two or more contiguous peripheral leads&#xD;
      or 2 mm in two or more contiguous precordial leads on electrocardiogram (ECG); and elevation&#xD;
      in serum markers of myocardial injury and necrosis (CK, CK-MB) three times their reference&#xD;
      value28. Non-ST-segment elevation ACS on ECG was defined as a clinical condition similar to&#xD;
      that mentioned above but with chest pain lasting less than 30 minutes, with or without&#xD;
      elevation of serum enzyme markers of myocardial injury and necrosis (CK, CK-MB, cardiac&#xD;
      troponins I and T). ACS patients were referred to the Department of Periodontology, Faculty&#xD;
      of Dentistry, Selcuk University (Konya/Turkey) for periodontal examination in a one- year&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria for control group :&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Patients diagnosed with localized or generalized periodontitis of stage II or III with&#xD;
      grade B or C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusions for both groups included&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  metabolic disorders,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  high blood pressure,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  treated with antihypertensive medications,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  periodontal therapy antibiotic treatment until 3 months prior the study. Smoking habits&#xD;
           and education status were also recorded. ACS patients take aspirin (1 × 100 mg per day)&#xD;
           during 1 month.This study was supported by grants from the Selcuk University Scientific&#xD;
           Research Projects (05401018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Periodontal Examination All surviving individuals with ACS underwent a thorough&#xD;
      periodontal examination approximately 1 month after treatment and hospital release. All&#xD;
      participants were evaluated for oral health clinically and radiographically. The periodontal&#xD;
      condition was graded based on the current classification method for periodontal diseases and&#xD;
      subjects with localized or generalized periodontitis of stage II or III with grade B or C&#xD;
      were selected. Periodontal health status of patients was evaluated by plaque index (PI),&#xD;
      papilla bleeding index , probing depth (PD) and clinical attachment level (CAL). All probing&#xD;
      scores were measured with Williams periodontal probe calibrated in millimeters. Clinical&#xD;
      attachment loss was determined relative to the cementoenamel junction. Periodontal index was&#xD;
      evaluated for risk of infectiousness (PIRI) scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gingival Crevicular Fluid Samples:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline, GCF samples were collected for each subject from 4 distinct inter-proximal sites&#xD;
      (one site for each quadrant). Sampling sites were chosen only at the buccal directions of the&#xD;
      inter-proximal regions of molar teeth with PD more than 5 mm. The four GCF samples for each&#xD;
      subject in the two research groups were pooled to ensure sufficient sensitivity for each&#xD;
      subject. Consequently, site-specific differences were not evaluated. The same sites were&#xD;
      sampled at 1 and 3 months following treatment. Sites were isolated with cotton rolls, gently&#xD;
      dried with air syringe and the obvious supra-gingival plaque was carefully removed with a&#xD;
      curette. GCF was collected with prefabricated paper strips . The strip was inserted into the&#xD;
      pocket until mild resistance was felt and kept there for 30 seconds. Contaminated samples&#xD;
      with blood or saliva were discharged. The volume of GCF was determined with Periotron 8000&#xD;
      previously calibrated with serum . Four strips were pooled in a single tube containing&#xD;
      500microliter phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4 and, repeated, for each patient. The&#xD;
      tubes were vortexed for 10 min and stored at -80 C until assayed.&#xD;
