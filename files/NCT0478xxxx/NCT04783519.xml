      This study is designed to develop an integrated intervention to reduce alcohol and MJ use and&#xD;
      consequences and improve sleep among young adults (YA) with comorbid heavy episodic drinking&#xD;
      (HED), MJ use, and sleep impairment. HED in YA is an important public health problem, with&#xD;
      consequences including accidental injury and death, academic or work problems, unsafe and&#xD;
      unwanted sex, and development of alcohol use disorders. Many YA with HED also use MJ, often&#xD;
      simultaneously, and experience increased harm as a result. Sleep impairment is common and&#xD;
      problematic among YA, identified as the 3rd leading barrier to academic success for students&#xD;
      and an important risk factor for mental health problems and suicide in YA. Alcohol use has&#xD;
      been linked to impaired sleep in adolescent, YA, college, and older adult populations, with&#xD;
      bidirectional causal links between alcohol use and impaired sleep, including negative&#xD;
      physiological effects of alcohol on the sleep cycle (e.g., suppression of REM sleep), use of&#xD;
      alcohol to promote sleep onset which can both increase alcohol use and resultant sleep&#xD;
      impairment, and poor sleep hygiene including delayed and variable sleep-wake timing&#xD;
      associated with cyclical patterns of alcohol use during evening and/or weekend social events.&#xD;
      Comorbidity of HED and sleep impairment is associated with increased consequences of alcohol&#xD;
      use, and exacerbates risk of accidents (including automobile accidents), impaired&#xD;
      decision-making, and work and academic difficulties. Similar bidirectional relations exist&#xD;
      with MJ use and sleep. Despite risks and consequences, alcohol and MJ prevention programs&#xD;
      rarely target sleep directly, and the majority of YA interventions for sleep either focus on&#xD;
      sleep hygiene broadly in the absence of specific strategies shown to improve sleep or reduce&#xD;
      alcohol or MJ use, or have been relatively intensive interventions with insufficient sample&#xD;
      size to truly evaluate impacts on sleep or related comorbid alcohol or MJ use. The current&#xD;
      study addresses these gaps through developing and evaluating feasibility and preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy of a brief, integrated intervention combining efficacious brief motivational&#xD;
      feedback and skills for reducing HED and MJ use and consequences (BASICS) with Brief&#xD;
      Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (SLEEP) shown to improve sleep in other populations.&#xD;
      Feasibility and efficacy will be evaluated over a 3-month period, using surveys and daily&#xD;
      diaries to assess alcohol, MJ, and sleep at post-intervention and 3- months. Specific aims&#xD;
      are: 1) Assess feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy BASICS + SLEEP in&#xD;
      reducing alcohol use and consequences, improving sleep, and weakening daily and lagged (next&#xD;
      day) relationships between alcohol and MJ use and sleep impairment; and 2) Use diary data to&#xD;
      explore daily and lagged relationships between alcohol use, MJ, sleep impairment, and unique&#xD;
      YA contextual factor to further inform prevention of comorbid alcohol use, MJ, and sleep&#xD;
      impairment.&#xD;

    <description>The BASICS + SLEEP intervention will integrate BASICS feedback and the Motivational Interviewing (MI) process described in the BASICS arm with Brief Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (BBTI) content and materials. The BASICS + SLEEP intervention will be implemented in 2 sessions of 45-75 minutes and 2 telephone booster sessions. We will follow BBTI procedures, including provision of a physiological rationale for insomnia and the importance of behavioral strategies to regulate sleep; introduction of sleep hygiene; discussion of factors that can impede duration and quality of sleep; introduction of sleep restriction and stimulus control strategies and negotiation of an initial sleep restriction schedule; and follow-up evaluation of success and continued refinement to achieve sleep efficiency goals. Booster contacts serve as opportunities to adjust the sleep restriction schedule, problem-solve challenges, and further build motivation.</description>

    <description>The BASICS condition will meet for 2 sessions of 45-75 minutes. Content depends on the degree to which participants discuss the feedback, have questions, and/or explore behavior change options. Therapists review feedback components with participants, eliciting personally relevant reasons to change as domains are explored. When the participant is ambivalent about change, therapists work with them to explore and resolve that ambivalence. The method is non-confrontational and utilizes exploration of personalized graphic feedback (i.e., frequency, quantity, and peak use alongside perceived and actual norms for alcohol/MJ use) to increase motivation for change by highlighting ways alcohol and/or marijuana use could be incongruent with goals or values. Beliefs, expectations, and motives for use are discussed as are strategies to minimize risks and consequences. Booster sessions address questions and problem-solve challenges that have arisen since the session.</description>

    <description>Participants in Assessment Only Control (AOC) condition will complete all assessments (including survey, daily, actigraphy) at the same time as participants in the 2 active interventions. AOC will also attend an in-person meeting to verify identity, provide rationale for daily monitoring, control for time/attention, and participants in all conditions including AOC will receive referrals for community services to address alcohol and MJ use, sleep, and other mental health concerns. No participants will be deprived of services; use of outside services will be tracked to assist with interpretation of outcomes. AOC condition will be offered BASICS + SLEEP after 3-month follow-up.</description>

    <description>Brief Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (BBTI) focuses primarily on stimulus control and sleep restriction as well as sleep hygiene recommendations delivered over 2 in-person sessions and 2 brief telephone boosters and is designed to be implemented by nonspecialists in primary care or other non-clinical settings. The intervention is manualized, and clients utilize sleep diaries and workbook assignments to consolidate recommendations.</description>

    <intervention_name>Brief Alcohol Screening and Intervention for College Students (BASICS)</intervention_name>
    <description>Brief Alcohol Screening and Intervention for College Students (BASICS) is a manualized brief intervention targeting alcohol use and consequences among high risk drinkers and includes both personalized feedback regarding drinking norms, consequences, and motives for drinking, as well as protective behavioral skills for reducing heavy episodic drinking and related consequences. BASICS is delivered in a motivational interviewing (MI) style (Miller &amp; Rollnick, 2002) to enhance intrinsic motivation to change drinking and implement protective behavioral strategies. BASICS has been adapted to target marijuana use and has been adapted for use with a variety of populations.</description>
