  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the long term functional capacity and quality of life of patients with a&#xD;
      history of vascular ring whether they did or did not have corrective surgery. Patients will&#xD;
      perform pulmonary function test, 6 minute walk test, cardiopulmonary exercise test and will&#xD;
      fill a quality of life questionnaire.&#xD;

      Vascular rings are congenital vascular anomalies of the aortic arch that compress the&#xD;
      esophagus and the trachea. The most common vascular rings are double aortic arch and right&#xD;
      aortic arch with left ligamentum. Pulmonary artery sling is less common. Another cause of&#xD;
      tracheal compression occurring only in infants is the innominate artery compression syndrome.&#xD;
      When patients are symptomatic, surgical correction should be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      data regarding long term functional capacity and quality of life is lacking. our aim is to&#xD;
      investigate the long term functional capacity and quality of life of patients with history of&#xD;
      vascular ring whether they did or did not have corrective surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: a prospective study evaluating functional capacity and quality of life the patients&#xD;
      will perform pulmonary function test, 6 minute walk test, cardiopulmonary exercise test and&#xD;
      will fill a quality of life questionnaire (sf-36).&#xD;

    <description>CPET using a cycle ergometer (COSMED, Rome, Italy) beginning with no resistance warmup lasting 1-3 minutes followed with an incrementing resistance adapted to the patient's functional capacities according to the examiner's free judgment by successive stages&#xD;
Six minute walk test - patients will be instructed to walk as far as possible for six minutes in a 30-meter long enclosed corridor with a flat and hard surface, marked at every meter. Meters will be calculated at the end of the test.&#xD;
SF-36 is a questionnaire that contains eight domains - physical functioning (10 items); role limitations due to physical functioning (4 items); role limitations due to emotional problems (3 items); energy and vitality (4 items); mental health (5 items); social functioning (2 items); bodily pain (2 items); and general health perceptions (5 items).&#xD;
Scores are summed for each domain and were transformed into scores of between 0 (worst possible health state) to 100 (best possible health state).</description>
