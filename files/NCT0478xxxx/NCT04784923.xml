  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our study focuses on reducing the use of CT (Computer Tomography) for pedicle screw&#xD;
      instrumentation, replacing CT with X-ray. We are writing a program to measure the position on&#xD;
      X-ray seeing whether the position meets that on CT after operation. In the future,our method&#xD;
      can be used in fluoroscopy, helping us detecting screw malposition efficiently during the&#xD;
      surgeries, and hoping reduce complications.&#xD;

      Most of the spine surgeries are decompression, fusion, with instrumentation.Instrumentation&#xD;
      needs screws. Pedicle screws are often used. If the pedicle screws are mal-located, that is&#xD;
      breaking the pedicle wall; the consequence may be injury of the spinal cord, or nerve root.&#xD;
      Some lucky patients may have no symptom; however, broken pedicle will reduce the fixation&#xD;
      strength which may reduce fusion rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detecting malposition screws, currently we use CT (computer tomography) method. The surgeon&#xD;
      carefully read the CT slice by slice, looking for clues of screws malposition. However, CT is&#xD;
      costly both price and radiation dose.We invented a plain radiograph method which has been&#xD;
      pilot tested in one patient with good correction rate. The purpose of this study is to solve&#xD;
      the following two clinical problems:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What are the inter-observer and intra-observer reliabilities of CT method?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The radiation dose for CT method is too high. Does our plain radiograph method has the&#xD;
           same correction rate? Materials and methods We planned to collect about 100 patients&#xD;
           received spinal fusion and instrumentation who has preoperative CT(or MRI) and&#xD;
           postoperative plain radiographs and CT. We will firstly verify CT method's&#xD;
           reproducibility by interobserver and intra-observer reliability test. With the same&#xD;
           databank, we will use our plain radiograph method again, and test if the two methods'&#xD;
           results are the same by Chi-square test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hope our study can reduce some unnecessary CT examination. In the future,our method can be&#xD;
      used in fluoroscopy, helping us detecting screw malposition efficiently during the surgeries,&#xD;
      and hoping reduce complications.&#xD;
