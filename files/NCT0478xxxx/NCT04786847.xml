  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 trial of TLX591, a monoclonal antibody HuX591 conjugated with a DOTA&#xD;
      chelator and radiolabelled with 177Lu (177Lu-DOTA-TLX591). TLX591 is being developed as a&#xD;
      PSMA-targeting antibody to be radiolabelled with a therapeutic radiosotope for the treatment&#xD;
      of PSMA-expressing tumours, therefore this study has been designed to assess the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics, whole body biodistribution and radiation dosimetry of&#xD;
      177Lu-DOTA-TLX591.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This multi-center prospective Phase 1 study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      biodistribution and dosimetry of 177Lu-DOTA-TLX591 administered to patients together with&#xD;
      best SoC with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) that expresses PSMA and&#xD;
      has progressed despite prior treatment with a novel androgen axis drug (NAAD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PSMA positivity will be defined by 68Ga-PSMA-11 or [18F]DCFPyL PET/CT where at least one site&#xD;
      of metastatic disease has an intensity of tracer uptake significantly greater than normal&#xD;
      liver (i.e., standardized uptake value [SUV]max at least 1.5 times SUV of normal liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 25-50 eligible patients will be enrolled and evaluated for safety and&#xD;
      tolerability as well as undergo imaging to allow determination of the biodistribution and&#xD;
      dosimetry 177Lu-DOTA-TLX591. All patients will receive two single intravenous (IV) infusions&#xD;
      of 76 mCi each (equivalent to 45 mCi/m2 in a standard 1.7m2 individual) of 177Lu-DOTA-TLX591,&#xD;
      given notionally 14 days apart, plus best SoC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty-five patients will also be enrolled in a biodistribution and dosimetry sub-study,&#xD;
      involving the collection of quantitative single-photon emission computerized tomography&#xD;
      (SPECT) or single-photon emission computerized tomography/computerized tomography (SPECT/CT)&#xD;
      data in a subset of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECT/CT scans will be performed after administration of the drug, at the following&#xD;
      timepoints: i) 4h ± 5 min, ii) 24 ± 4h, iii) 96 ± 4h, iv) Day 7± 4h and v) Day 13± 4h. These&#xD;
      SPECT/CT scans will be conducted to further support safety monitoring and to understand&#xD;
      exposure of tumour and healthy tissue to 177Lu-DOTA-TLX591.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging data from the first five patients enrolled in the biodistribution study will be&#xD;
      analysed and, if appropriate, the number of imaging timepoints will be reduced to three for&#xD;
      subsequent patients. Qualitative comparison of 68Ga-PSMA-PET/CT images and 177Lu-DOTA-TLX591&#xD;
      images will also be undertaken for patients undergoing the biodistribution study to ensure&#xD;
      equivalence of radiopharmaceutical localization to tumour sites and equivalent off-target&#xD;
      localization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis will be performed at 15 min ± 5 min before&#xD;
      administration of the drug, and at the following timepoints after dosing: i) end of infusion&#xD;
      ± 5min, ii) 60 min ± 5 min, ii) 4h ± 5 min, iii) 24 ± 4h, v) 48 ± 4h, vi) 96 ± 4h, vii) Day&#xD;
      7± 4h and viii) Day 13± 4h.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of information on prior and concomitant medications and adverse events (AEs), as&#xD;
      well as the review of temporary contra-indications and conditions for withdrawal, will occur&#xD;
      at every patient interaction.&#xD;
