  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite increasing suicide rates in adolescents, there remains a paucity of approaches to use&#xD;
      to prevent re-attempts. Any hope for breaking the code to prevent youth suicide lies in&#xD;
      understanding biological factors that play a role. Evidence suggests that inflammation and&#xD;
      immune system dysfunction may be linked to suicide. The investigators will develop immune&#xD;
      profiles for adolescents with suicidal behavior and those at risk in order to develop tools&#xD;
      that can be implemented for prevention efforts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study involves blood draws, answering questions, and completing questionnaires - no&#xD;
      treatment or intervention is provided as part of this study. Participants will be screened to&#xD;
      see if they qualify for this study using questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be teens (ages 12-18 years) with recent suicidal behavior, teens at-risk&#xD;
      for developing depression, and healthy control teens. Participants complete all study-related&#xD;
      tasks four times over a period of 12 months. Electronic surveys will be sent to participants&#xD;
      to complete monthly. Both the adolescent and if applicable, their parent (or legally&#xD;
      authorized representatives, LARs), will answer questions regarding depression, anxiety, and&#xD;
      suicidal thoughts/behaviors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to map inflammatory dysfunction to suicidal behavior and&#xD;
      establish a reliable immune signature of suicide risk that can 1) guide future research into&#xD;
      fundamental pathophysiology and 2) identify targets for drug development and guide clinical&#xD;
      screening and risk management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: In previous research, the investigators have identified targets of clinical&#xD;
      utility for both suicide-risk identification and novel therapeutic development. Specifically,&#xD;
      a state of immune hyper-reactivity that predisposes to suicidal behavior can be corrected by&#xD;
      use of immunomodulatory agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tests screening for presence of autoantibodies may be implemented as diagnostic tests&#xD;
      to predict future suicide risk. Monoclonal antibodies have gained recent attention for their&#xD;
      use in CNS disorders (such as multiple sclerosis and migraine) and have been shown to be&#xD;
      effective for some patients with depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the utility of anti-inflammatory treatments for depression has been limited by a&#xD;
      lack of biomarkers to guide their use. Thus, presence of autoantibodies may identify a&#xD;
      sub-group of adolescents and young adults with suicidality who are candidates for treatment&#xD;
      with monoclonal antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators specifically hypothesize that depressed youths with suicide behavior have&#xD;
      immune hyper-reactivity, as reflected in dysfunctional cells mediating both innate and&#xD;
      adaptive immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Items: Since this is an observational study, investigators will explore a comprehensive&#xD;
      panel of carefully selected participant specific parameters: socio-demographic (age,&#xD;
      ethnicity, economic); symptom severity measures (depressive symptoms, mood, and feelings);&#xD;
      clinical (medical history, anxious depression, early life trauma), biological (biomarkers in&#xD;
      blood), behavioral (cognitive, emotional), with the goal to develop the most robust&#xD;
      predictive models of treatment response and of depression outcomes. There is no medication or&#xD;
      non-medication treatment or intervention provided by this study.&#xD;
