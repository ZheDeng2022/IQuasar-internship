    <textblock>
      The application of transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) with drug-eluting beads in patients&#xD;
      with hepatocellular carcinoma and its response to the treatment will be observed. The&#xD;
      registry has the following objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the response to the treatment by standard methods and volumetric analysis as well&#xD;
      as trying to determine any predictive response factors To determinate interobserver&#xD;
      variability of the methods.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patients with hepatocellular carcinoma in stage suitable for treatment by transarterial&#xD;
      chemoembolization (TACE) with drug-eluting beads are included in the study. The investigators&#xD;
      assess the response to the treatment by standard methods (RECIST, mRECIST) as well as by&#xD;
      volumetric analysis. The size of tumor is evaluated on CT/MRI by two investigators prior to&#xD;
      first TACE and then on all the check-ups (routinely every three months) until 31 December,&#xD;
      2019 or the patients' death.&#xD;

    <description>A contrast agent (Xenetix350, Guerbet, France) was applied under local anaesthesia via the common femoral artery using a 5F sheath. Selective catheterization of the coeliac trunk and other arteries supplying the liver was then performed under fluoroscopic control. A pathological vascularization pattern was identified and chemoembolization material consisting of DC beads (BTG International Ltd) was injected by the treating angiographist using micro instrumentation. Follow-up CT or MRI was performed after 1-3 TACE sessions according to the extent of the lesion, 3 weeks following the last procedure. Patients with completed treatments were scheduled for an imaging follow-up every 3 months, allowing evaluation of the effect of treatment. In case of a positive response to the treatment another session of TACE was indicated. Chemoembolization sessions were performed as inpatient procedures with the mean hospitalization time of 4 days.</description>
