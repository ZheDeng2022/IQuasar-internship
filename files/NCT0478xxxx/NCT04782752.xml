  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective phase I study to determine the safety and feasibility of non-ablative&#xD;
      oligofractionated radiation therapy (NORT) before lung transplantation for patients with&#xD;
      underlying pulmonary malignancy. We hypothesize that heterogeneous dose distributions could&#xD;
      generate a vaccination effect against the tumor by creating anti-tumoral immune response in&#xD;
      the body and these patients may be immunized against their tumor which could reduce the risk&#xD;
      of cancer recurrence after transplantation despite the anti-rejection medications required&#xD;
      for the transplantation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to deliver short courses of radiation to the pulmonary malignancy&#xD;
      followed by resection of the radiated tumor at the time of transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a 3+3 phase 1 study with incremental dose of radiation to determine the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD). Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) will be defined as grade 3+ radiation&#xD;
      related toxicity. If one DLT is seen, then an additional 3 patients will be treated at the&#xD;
      same dose level. If 2 or more DLT are seen at any given dose level, then the previous dose&#xD;
      level will be defined as the MTD. A minimum of 3 patients and maximum of 18 patients will be&#xD;
      included for the phase 1a. Due to the expected higher radiation risks in patients with&#xD;
      end-stage ILD (group 1), these patients will be stratified separately from non-ILD patients&#xD;
      (group 2, 3 and 4) during phase 1a. Dose tested are: 3 x 400 cGy, 3 x 600 cGy and 3 x 800 cGy&#xD;
      for the ILD cohort and 3 x 800 cGy, 3 x 1000 cGy and 3 x 1200 cGy for the non-ILD cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the MTD is determined, patients will proceed to phase 1b using the MTD determined in the&#xD;
      phase 1a. ILD and non-ILD patients may have different MTD so two separate phase Ib cohorts&#xD;
      will be conducted. A total of 12 patients will be included for each cohort in the phase 1b.&#xD;
      The dose distribution will be administered using a standard homogenous dose distribution for&#xD;
      tumors ≤2 cm, and an heterogeneous dose distribution for tumors &gt;2 cm.&#xD;

    <description>AEs will be graded by CTCAE. Maximum tolerated dose is the dose level do not result in fatal injury (grade 5 lung toxicity) or life-threatening or fatal treatment related toxicity (grade 4+).&#xD;
Safety will be determined by the absence of grade 3 or greater (G3+) complications related to radiation and the feasibility to list patients for transplantation one week after the end of radiation will be determined.</description>

    <description>Patients will be differentiated into 4 groups:&#xD;
Patients with end-stage interstitial lung disease (ILD) and suspected stage I (up to 4 cm) primary lung cancer&#xD;
Patients with end-stage lung disease other than ILD (e.g. emphysema/COPD, cystic fibrosis and pulmonary hypertension) and suspected stage I (up to 4 cm) primary lung cancer&#xD;
Patients with multifocal primary lung cancer (e.g. multifocal adenocarcinoma) in the absence of nodal metastasis and distant metastasis.&#xD;
Patients with isolated pulmonary metastasis in the absence of other sites of malignancy (primary and metastatic).&#xD;
For this study, different doses will be used for each different group depending on their tumour size. The first 3 patients will start with a dose of 4 Gy, for the ILD group, or 8 Gy, for the non ILD group. The doses are then increased incrementally until the dose limiting toxicity is reached.</description>
