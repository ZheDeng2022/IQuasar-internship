      Eradication therapy against Helicobacter pylori (Hp) carries adverse effects, such as&#xD;
      altering the intestinal microbiota's structure and function and selecting commensals and&#xD;
      pathogens resistant to antibiotics. This last undesirable effect turns the microbiota into a&#xD;
      reservoir of resistance genes. Saccharomyces boulardii CNCM I-745 (Sb) can improve dysbiosis&#xD;
      and reduce the abundance of multi-resistant bacteria. The objective of the current project is&#xD;
      to characterize the resistome of individuals treated with anti-H. pylori therapy in the&#xD;
      presence or absence of Sb in fecal samples. Applying metagenomics and using next-generation&#xD;
      sequencing tools, the investigators seek to demonstrate the beneficial effect of Sb on the&#xD;
      gut microbiota by reducing the abundance of resistance genes and characterizing bacteria&#xD;
      modulated by this probiotic-yeast. The investigators expect to find an increase in the&#xD;
      diversity and relative abundance of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the intestine of&#xD;
      participants who did not receive Sb during Hp eradication therapy and one month after&#xD;
      completing treatment. The increase in ARGs is probably correlated with the presence of&#xD;
      Clostridia and Bacteroides.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Antibiotic use is one of the most common therapeutic strategies of modern medicine. Together&#xD;
      with the significant beneficial effects of antibiotic use, side effects accompany the use of&#xD;
      these drugs, including the increasing appearance of antibiotic-resistant microbes, a global&#xD;
      public health problem. Other significant side effects include gastrointestinal-related&#xD;
      symptoms such as diarrhea, pain, intestinal discomfort, and flatulence, which can be the&#xD;
      consequence of dysbiosis. A common strategy to limit antibiotic-associated side effects is&#xD;
      the addition of probiotics, as S. boulardii CNCM I-745 (Sb). The use of bacterial probiotics&#xD;
      to reduce antibiotic-associated side effects has several potential limitations, including the&#xD;
      destruction of probiotics, development of probiotics strains resistant to antibiotics, and&#xD;
      passage of antibiotic-resistant genes to pathogenic bacteria through horizontal gene&#xD;
      transfer. Sb is a probiotic yeast whose benefits on intestinal dysbiosis have been associated&#xD;
      with establishing a favorable growth environment for the normal intestinal microbiota. Due to&#xD;
      the yeast nature of this probiotic, the limitations of bacterial-probiotics cannot be&#xD;
      accounted for during Sb use. Consequently, it is crucial to study the molecular mechanism&#xD;
      elicited by Sb on intestinal microbiota, including changes in resistome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our previous study regarding the supplementation with Sb on the treatment against H.&#xD;
      pylori (Hp) infection, patients that received the probiotic had a significantly lower&#xD;
      frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms. Additionally, those patients have a higher number of&#xD;
      bacterial diversity evenness (P=0.0156), higher abundance of Enterobactereacea, and lower&#xD;
      abundance of Bacteroides and Clostridia upon treatment completion and one month later.&#xD;
      Bacteroides and Clostridia have been previously implicated as antibiotic multi-resistant&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory strains. The objective of the current project is to characterize the&#xD;
      resistome of individuals treated with anti-H. pylori therapy in the presence or absence of Sb&#xD;
      in fecal samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims To determine the resistome changes before and after Hp eradication treatment in&#xD;
      patients that have received or not Sb.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the resistome patterns between patients treated for Hp infection that have&#xD;
      received or not SB, at the time of completion of treatment and one month after finishing&#xD;
      them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the shotgun metagenomics, the researchers seek to characterize the microbiome and&#xD;
      resistome in fecal samples and understand the microbiome's functional characteristics,&#xD;
      including virulence genes, metabolic pathways, and mobile genetic elements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology DNA obtained from the previous microbiome characterization will be used in this&#xD;
      project. In case DNA is not enough, the researchers will extract DNA from the frozen stored&#xD;
      samples using the Power Soil kit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DNA will be shipped to UNC Chapel Hill or the University of Minnesota, where genomic&#xD;
      libraries will be constructed. Hi-Seq Illumina runs will be used to produce a sequencing&#xD;
      deepness of 10 million per sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FASTQC will be used for reads quality control and multiQC as reports generator from the raw&#xD;
      reads. Trimmomatic will be used to trim Illumina adapters and to cut reads on the average&#xD;
      quality. As human DNA is present on the fecal samples, the investigators have to remove the&#xD;
      host DNA using the mapping software BWA and SAMtools. Using the Resfinder database, the&#xD;
      investigators must align the filtered reads and generate a count table using&#xD;
      ResistomeAnalyzer. Finally, the researchers can create rarefaction curves based on the table&#xD;
      made using AMRPlusPlus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results The researchers expect to find a higher diversity and abundance of&#xD;
      antibiotic resistance genes (genome intrinsic and carried by mobile genetic elements) on the&#xD;
      group that did not receive Sb at the end of treatment and one month after its completion.&#xD;
      This would be correlated with the lower abundance of Clostridia and Bacteroides encountered&#xD;
      in the 16S rRNA gene microbiome characterization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also be able to sub-characterize the resistome diversity and abundance&#xD;
      of antibiotic resistance genes encountered typically on Enterobacteriaceae. A previous&#xD;
      analysis found a higher abundance of Enterobacteriaceae in the group that received Sb&#xD;
      (previously reported in a mouse model by Sovran et al. 2018). Additionally, since the&#xD;
      researchers will obtain the raw reads on the shotgun sequencing, they could further&#xD;
      characterize the bacteria modulated by the use of Sb at strain level (Bacteroides,&#xD;
      Clostridia, and Enterobacteriaceae). Together, the researchers expect to obtain valuable data&#xD;
      on the use of Sb regarding antibiotic resistance and further microbiome characteristics,&#xD;
      including genes of bacterial pathogenicity. These results will contribute to clarify the&#xD;
      beneficial effects of Sb addition in patients treated for Hp infection.&#xD;
