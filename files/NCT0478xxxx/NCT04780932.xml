  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is characterised by an obstruction of&#xD;
      proximal or more distal pulmonary arteries by residual organized thrombi, combined with a&#xD;
      variable microscopic pulmonary vasculopathy (microvasculopathy). Besides lifelong&#xD;
      anticoagulation, surgical pulmonary endarterectomy is the treatment of choice in subjects&#xD;
      with proximal CTEPH affecting large pulmonary arteries. However, around half of CTEPH&#xD;
      subjects are not operated, mainly because of distal lesions inaccessible to surgery.&#xD;
      International data have reported survival rates of 88, 79, and 70% at 1, 2, and 3 years,&#xD;
      respectively, in subjects with inoperable CTEPH, underscoring the need for better treatment&#xD;
      strategies. In those subjects, current guidelines recommend medical therapy with or without&#xD;
      balloon pulmonary angioplasty (BPA). Currently, only one drug (riociguat), targeting the NO&#xD;
      pathway, is approved and reimbursed in Europe. Thus, riociguat monotherapy is considered as&#xD;
      the standard-of-care treatment for subjects newly diagnosed with inoperable CTEPH. Recently,&#xD;
      macitentan, targeting the endothelin-1 pathway, showed to be also effective in subjects with&#xD;
      inoperable CTEPH. However, macitentan is currently not approved for CTEPH in Europe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BPA has been also reported to improve hemodynamics, symptoms and exercise capacity. However,&#xD;
      complications, including mainly vascular injury, may occur during this procedure and it has&#xD;
      been shown that the risk of BPA-related complications was strongly related to the level of&#xD;
      pre-BPA mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR).&#xD;
      Medical therapy and BPA have in fact complementary effects since they target different&#xD;
      lesions. Indeed, BPA targets fibrotic organized thrombi in the segmental arteries down to&#xD;
      small pulmonary arteries of 2-5 mm in diameter. Medical therapy, for its part, targets&#xD;
      microvasculopathy, similar to that observed in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), in&#xD;
      vessels less than 0.5 mm in diameter. Therefore, it is strongly believed that the use of&#xD;
      medical therapy prior to BPA may reduce the risk of BPA-related complications by improving&#xD;
      pulmonary hemodynamics and may improve global efficacy. In PAH, initial dual oral combination&#xD;
      therapy with drugs targeting the NO and endothelin pathways is considered as a standard of&#xD;
      care, more efficacious than monotherapy and safe. In contrast, there are no data from&#xD;
      controlled trials regarding the efficacy and safety of initial combination therapy regimens&#xD;
      versus standard-of-care monotherapy in treatment-naïve subjects with inoperable CTEPH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that initial dual oral combination therapy may be superior to&#xD;
      standard-of-care riociguat monotherapy for improving pulmonary hemodynamics prior to BPA and&#xD;
      for reducing the risk of BPA-related complications.&#xD;

      The Screening period will last up 28 days maximum. It begins at the first screening&#xD;
      assessment and ends with subject inclusion. The Screening visit date is the date when the&#xD;
      first screening assessment is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Treatment period will start at Day 1 with the first dose of riociguat and ends at Week 42&#xD;
      / End-of-Treatment (EOT) visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 8, the experimental treatment with macitentan / placebo will be started.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this period, regular hospital visits will be performed (Week 16, Week 29).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, laboratory tests will be performed every 4 weeks as part of standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who are still symptomatic (WHO FC II to IV) and have PVR≥ 240 dyn.sec.cm-5 at week&#xD;
      16 will be offered additional treatment by BPA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety follow-up period: After study drug discontinuation, all subjects will enter a Safety&#xD;
      follow-up period which ends with safety follow up visit/end of study, 30-35 days after the&#xD;
      last intake to the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects who prematurely and definitively discontinue study drug before Week 42 must have&#xD;
      a premature EOT visit as soon as possible but no later than 7 days after the decision of&#xD;
      definitive discontinuation of study drug and have a safety follow-up visit as described&#xD;
      above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-Treatment Observational Period: Subjects are to remain in the study after premature EOT&#xD;
      and safety visit and undergo all study assessments up to Week 42, except subjects&#xD;
      discontinuing study drug due to PH-related disease progression who will have a premature EOT&#xD;
      visit and Safety follow-up visit and will be withdrawn from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 96 newly diagnosed and treatment-naïve subjects with inoperable CTEPH will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either macitentan (n=48) or placebo (n=48)&#xD;
      combined with standard of care with riociguat.&#xD;
