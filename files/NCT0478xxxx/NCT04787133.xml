      Compare the experience of patients receiving an &quot;optimized&quot; preoperative anesthesia&#xD;
      consultation (PAC) performed by a Nurse Anesthetist (supervised by an anesthetist) to those&#xD;
      receiving a &quot;standard&quot; CSA ( CSA by an anesthetist alone).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Preoperative anesthesia consultations (PACs) are a key moment in the perioperative care&#xD;
      journey. During the PAC, the doctor assesses the patient's state of health (allowing an&#xD;
      assessment of the perioperative risk), establishes the anesthesia protocol and writes the&#xD;
      preoperative prescriptions. PAC also helps inform and educate patients to reduce their&#xD;
      anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indeed, if the perioperative care pathway and the risks associated with anesthesia are poorly&#xD;
      understood, there is an increased risk of preoperative anxiety, poor compliance with&#xD;
      preoperative prescriptions, and therefore potential cancellation of the surgical&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In many countries, preoperative PACs are performed by nurses trained and supervised by&#xD;
      anesthetists. These PACs take longer than a consultation carried out by a doctor alone, but&#xD;
      would on the one hand have a positive effect on patient education and, on the other hand,&#xD;
      ultimately reduce the time and costs associated with the PAC . On the other hand, the impact&#xD;
      of PACs performed by nurses supervised by physicians on the perioperative experience of&#xD;
      patients and on the rate of cancellations of scheduled interventions has not yet been&#xD;
      demonstrated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since 2013, so-called &quot;optimized&quot; consultations (PAC carried out by a state-certified nurse -&#xD;
      IDE - supervised by an anesthesiologist) have been carried out at the Adolphe de Rothschild&#xD;
      Foundation (Paris), for patients having a scheduled surgery intervention. cataract under&#xD;
      locoregional or general anesthesia. First, the IDE collects the patient's history and&#xD;
      treatments and informs him of the perioperative care pathway. In a second step, the doctor&#xD;
      performs the pre-anesthetic medical examination, completes the medical examination and writes&#xD;
      the appropriate pre and postoperative prescriptions. This method of consultation made it&#xD;
      possible to optimize medical time while providing complete, even better, information to the&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      That is why optimized PACs may improve the patient's perioperative experience and reduce&#xD;
      preoperative cancellations regardless of the type of surgery. programmed.&#xD;

    <description>Patient satisfaction will be assess within 48h after surgery using the &quot;Evaluation du Vécu de l'Anesthésie&quot; or &quot;EVAN&quot; (EVAN-G for EVAN-General anesthesia or EVAN-LR for EVAN-locoregional anesthesia).&#xD;
The EVAN-G includes 26 items; six specific scores (Attention, Information, Discomfort, Privacy, Waiting and Pain) and one global index score. The EVAN-LR comprises 19 items; ﬁve specific scores (Attention, Information, Discomfort, Waiting, and Pain) and one global index score.&#xD;
Specific and global index scores were linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale, with 100 indicating the best possible level of satisfaction and 0 indicating the worst.</description>
