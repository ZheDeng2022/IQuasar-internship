  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on the previous HMORCT09-2, the results show that IV PCA for analgesia maintenance&#xD;
      improvements control of severe cancer pain after successful titration. Therefore, a study is&#xD;
      planned to further explore the difference of efficacy and safety between PCA with continuous&#xD;
      + bolus dose versus bolus-only.&#xD;

    <description>The Numerical Rating Scale (NRS, a score of 0 means no pain and 10 means the most severe) is used to assess the severity of pain. NRS of 24 hours is assessed every day. Mean pain score is a sum of average NRS of Day 1 (D 1) to Day 3 divided by 3 (the day of titration is defined as D0, the first day after titration is defined as D1, the second day after titration is defined as D2, and so on).</description>
