  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite bariatric surgery being the most effective weight loss intervention for patients who&#xD;
      are severely obese, as many as 1 in 5 patients will develop an alcohol use disorder after&#xD;
      their surgery. Changes in metabolism, hormone levels, and behavior as a result of bariatric&#xD;
      surgery alter the rewarding effects of alcohol while concurrently changing its absorption&#xD;
      rate, putting patients at significantly elevated risk of hazardous drinking. Simply providing&#xD;
      education to this vulnerable patient population about post-surgical risks has not been&#xD;
      sufficient to reduce alcohol use, yet comprehensive in-person interventions are met with&#xD;
      significant challenges, including hours-long distances between patients and their bariatric&#xD;
      surgery programs. Thus, the long-term goal is to increase access to an empirically-supported&#xD;
      intervention for reducing alcohol use among patients who undergo bariatric surgery by&#xD;
      leveraging technology. This intervention, rooted in motivational interviewing and the&#xD;
      transtheoretical model, is a two-session computerized brief intervention CBI, supplemented by&#xD;
      six months of tailored text messaging based on participants CBI results and subsequent&#xD;
      fluctuations in their readiness to change. The purpose of the proposed study is to optimize&#xD;
      this technology-based intervention for patients who undergo bariatric surgery and to examine&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. In the first phase, patient interviews&#xD;
      will be utilized to identify preferences for intervention content and treatment delivery. Ten&#xD;
      patients will then participate in an open trial of the intervention, which will be&#xD;
      subsequently revised based on feedback from these patients. In Phase 2, patients will be&#xD;
      recruited between 3 and 6 months following bariatric surgery and randomized to the&#xD;
      intervention or treatment as usual control group. All patients will complete baseline&#xD;
      questionnaires and at 1, 3, 6, and 9 month post-assessments. The investigators expect that&#xD;
      this intervention will be both feasible and acceptable to patients. Results will be used as&#xD;
      preliminary data to inform a large, fully-powered clinical trial to test the larger efficacy&#xD;
      of this intervention.&#xD;

    <description>Yale Food Addiction Scale 2.0 (YFAS 2.0) will assess for symptoms of food addiction (similar to substance use disorder criteria in the DSM-V). Responses result in a symptom count that can range from 0-11 symptoms, with a higher number indicating more symptoms of food addiction. The scale can also indicate whether the symptoms are clinically significant (i.e., yes or no), and the scale can also give a determination of whether someone meets criteria for food addiction (yes or no), and if so, will determine if the addiction is considered mild, moderate, or severe.</description>
