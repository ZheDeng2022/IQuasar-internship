  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maternal and childhood obesity have dramatically increased and continue to present a&#xD;
      significant health problem. Studies show that offspring of overweight (body mass index, BMI&#xD;
      &gt;25-29.9) and obese (BMI ≥30) women are at increased risk of newborn and age 1-year&#xD;
      adiposity, and infant adiposity predicts childhood and adult obesity. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that infants of overweight/obese (OW/OB) mothers have both relative hyperphagia&#xD;
      and are provided human milk with increased caloric composition, leading to obesity. The&#xD;
      investigators propose an intervention study to calibrate milk or formula intake in infants of&#xD;
      OW/OB mothers so as to avoid overweight infants at 6 months of age.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical intervention study to calibrate infant milk or formula intake and modulate&#xD;
      infant weight gain to prevent the development of infant obesity. The investigators will study&#xD;
      only OW/OB women, as these patients are at increased risk of infants with excessive weight&#xD;
      gain. The study will be conducted using clinical site at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center and at&#xD;
      CTSI, The Lundquist Institute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OW/OB women (pre-pregnant BMI &gt;25-29.9 and ≥30) who are providing exclusive human milk via&#xD;
      pumping and bottle (n= 120; 50% male and 50% female) will be recruited postpartum in the&#xD;
      hospital or at postpartum visit (typically 3-6 weeks). Study women will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to a Standard Feed (SF) or Calibrated Feed (CF) groups. Mother-infant dyads will be seen at&#xD;
      2-week intervals for assessment of infant milk intake, weight gain, supine length, BMI and&#xD;
      skinfold thickness till 6 months of age. Continuation of exclusive human milk will be&#xD;
      confirmed with questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the SF group, mothers will provide bottled human milk based upon the volume guidelines:&#xD;
      Total daily milk intake recommended will be calculated as infant's weight in ounces divided&#xD;
      by 6, with individual feed volume calculated as the total daily volume divided by 6 to 8&#xD;
      (maternal discretion as to number of daily feeds). It is understood that mothers may elect an&#xD;
      increased or reduced volume of feed dependent upon infant appetite, behavior, etc. throughout&#xD;
      the study, at which time recommended feed volume will be adjusted by the standard formula&#xD;
      based upon infant weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the CF group, initial feeding volume will be based upon standard volume guidelines as&#xD;
      described above. At the 2 week visits, should infants be within the 75%ile of WHO BMI growth&#xD;
      curves, standard weight-based recommended feed volumes will be made. Should the infant be&#xD;
      equal or greater than 75%ile of WHO BMI, the recommended human milk feed volume will be&#xD;
      reduced by 5% of the weight-based determination, following a consultative assessment by our&#xD;
      pediatric/neonatal physician. At subsequent visits, adjustments in human milk volume will&#xD;
      continue if the infant exceeds 75%ile of WHO BMI, accommodating the normal increase in human&#xD;
      milk intake with advancing weight. In no case, will the daily human milk volume be reduced by&#xD;
      more than 10% from the weight-based calculation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Should the infant be less than 10th percentile of WHO BMI, the maternal-infant dyad will be&#xD;
      referred for a pediatric and nutrition consults to assess the cause and treatment for&#xD;
      potential nutrient deficiency. At 6 months, the investigators will assess the distribution of&#xD;
      infant weight BMI between SF and CF groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the final study visit (6 months), prior to infant feeding, a sample of infant urine will&#xD;
      be collected, using the Quick-Wee method with samples collected from voids into plastic bags&#xD;
      taped to the genital region. Samples will be analyzed for leptin by ELISA (DLP00, R&amp;D&#xD;
      Systems, MN). Urine leptin concentrations correlate significantly with plasma leptin&#xD;
      concentration and will provide a non-invasive, semi-quantitative assessment of neonatal&#xD;
      hyperleptinemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All mothers will quantify and record the daily bottle intake of infants (nearest ml) and will&#xD;
      provide a midpumping (8 min) milk sample (10 ml) obtained monthly prior to their visit&#xD;
      (morning pumping, frozen) for analysis of protein, carbohydrates and fat (Miris) and total&#xD;
      caloric content (bomb calorimetry).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 6 months, the investigators will assess the distribution of infant weight/BMI between SF&#xD;
      and CF groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An identical Study (Standard Feed and Calibrated Feed; (n=60 per group; 50% male and 50%&#xD;
      female)) will be performed, with the exception that only current formula feed mothers will be&#xD;
      enrolled. Daily volume and adjustment of formula feeds will be as described above for human&#xD;
      milk. Women will utilize their chosen brand of commercial formula feed, for which total&#xD;
      caloric content and composition will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis: The proportion of infants whose BMI exceed the 75%ile of WHO BMI at 26 weeks&#xD;
      (1st co-primary outcome) will be compared between the two group (SF vs CF) using a pooled&#xD;
      z-test or Fisher's exact test. Growth curves for SF and CF over 26 weeks will be estimated&#xD;
      and the area under the curve (AUC) compared with the 75%ile curve of WHO BMI. AUCs (secondary&#xD;
      outcome) will be computed using the trapezoidal method or integrations of the estimated&#xD;
      closed form of the mathematical function. The difference between these AUCs represents the&#xD;
      magnitude of how long and much BMI exceed the 75%ile of WHO BMI over the 6 month period.&#xD;
      These AUC between the two groups will be compared using a two sample t-test. As exploratory&#xD;
      analyses, if potential covariates are found, multivariate analyses (linear and generalized&#xD;
      linear regression models) will be used to adjust confounding effects. Sub-group analyses will&#xD;
      be also carried out, such as by gender. The investigators will also investigate if early&#xD;
      changes in growth curves or maternal human milk composition are associated with infant weight&#xD;
      changes, so as to determine the potential for invention prior to exceeding the 75%ile of WHO&#xD;
      BMI.&#xD;
