  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite advances in obstetric care, preeclampsia (PE) remains the leading cause of maternal&#xD;
      death and disability in both developed and developing countries, contributing to over 70,000&#xD;
      maternal and 500,000 fetal deaths annually worldwide. PULSE was designed using a preventative&#xD;
      medicine approach, focusing on improving early detection of PE as opposed to managing&#xD;
      symptoms after onset. The study aims to uncover the earliest possible signs of PE using a&#xD;
      combination of novel clinical tools and established diagnostic techniques to better identify,&#xD;
      track, and manage high risk pregnant women. Specifically, PULSE will be examining the&#xD;
      incorporation of a non-invasive test for the measurement of arterial stiffness, which has&#xD;
      been shown to be predictive of hypertensive disorders. This test, in combination with a wide&#xD;
      range of blood biomarkers, detailed ultrasound imaging, and a comprehensive battery of&#xD;
      physical and mental health questionnaires, represents the largest, most comprehensive&#xD;
      preventative PE study to date. The results of this work has the potential to revolutionize&#xD;
      the way PE and other hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are managed and treated and can&#xD;
      serve to inform the design of future preventative clinical research studies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Existing predictive tools for preeclampsia (PE), including clinical characteristics, blood&#xD;
      pressure, blood biomarkers, and uterine artery Doppler indices, have, at best, moderate&#xD;
      predictive properties. While maternal symptoms often resolve with the delivery of the&#xD;
      placenta, the burden of PE extends beyond pregnancy; afflicted women are at 3.1-fold&#xD;
      increased odds of developing hypertension and 2.3-fold increased odds for cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease later in life compared to women with uncomplicated pregnancies. Placental pathogenic&#xD;
      changes associated with PE occur weeks to months before clinical manifestations develop,&#xD;
      presenting a window of opportunity to identify early those women who will develop PE. The&#xD;
      goal of the study investigators is to capitalize on this window and develop strategies for&#xD;
      early prediction of PE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a composite measure of vascular health, measurement of arterial stiffness and wave&#xD;
      reflection could represent a promising non-invasive tool for PE prediction. This&#xD;
      multi-national 5-year observational prospective study aims to recruit 2400 participants&#xD;
      across 8 sites in Canada, the US, and the UK. Participants will undergo 2 assessments, one in&#xD;
      the first trimester (10 - 13 weeks gestation) and one in the second trimester (18 - 21 weeks&#xD;
      gestation), which involve vascular measurements (arterial stiffness, blood pressure), blood&#xD;
      sample collection, psychosocial and demographic questionnaires, and Uterine Artery Doppler&#xD;
      imaging (only at second visit). Post-natal outcome measurements will be collected via medical&#xD;
      charts for each participant 6-8 weeks post-partum. The primary objective of the study is to&#xD;
      determine if, and to what extent, arterial stiffness and wave reflection parameters improve&#xD;
      early prediction of PE beyond that achieved by currently available predictors in high-risk&#xD;
      pregnancies.&#xD;
