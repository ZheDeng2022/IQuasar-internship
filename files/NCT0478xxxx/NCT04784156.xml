      This proposal is a collaborative effort between MedShape and the Medical University of South&#xD;
      Carolina. This is a prospective investigation to assess the clinical outcomes of patients&#xD;
      with a subtalar arthrodesis with the Sustained Dynamic Compression Intramedullary Nail&#xD;
      (DynaNail Mini). The study plan is to enroll 60 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with end-stage talocalcaneal (subtalar) joint arthritis from any etiology will be&#xD;
      asked to enroll in the study. After informed consent, the patients will be asked to complete&#xD;
      the following patient reported outcomes questionnaires as part of the Surgical Outcomes&#xD;
      System (SOS) Global Registry: Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain, Veterans RAND 12 Item&#xD;
      Health Survey for function, Foot Function Index - Revised for function and pain, the Foot and&#xD;
      Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM) for function, and the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle&#xD;
      Society (AOFAS) scales for pain, function, and alignment. After informed consent, they will&#xD;
      then be scheduled for surgery in a routine fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following surgical procedure is standard of care. The surgical procedure will involve&#xD;
      subtalar (talocalcaneal) joint preparation through a lateral approach. The use of&#xD;
      supplemental bone graft is at the discretion of the treating surgeon but must be documented.&#xD;
      The MedShape DynaNail Mini will then be inserted according to the manufacturer's technique.&#xD;
      The patient will be placed in a short leg splint and kept non-weight bearing. The patient&#xD;
      will be discharged from the hospital when medically ready.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will return to clinic for visits at the following intervals after surgery: 6 (+/-&#xD;
      1) weeks, 14 (+/- 1) weeks, 6 months (+/- 2 weeks), and 12 months (+/- 2 weeks). At each of&#xD;
      these time points, the same SOS patient specific outcome questionnaires will be administered.&#xD;
      3-view X-rays will be taken at each of these visits to assess the amount of travel of the&#xD;
      Mini compressive element. At 15 (+/- 1) weeks post-op, a CT scan will be obtained to assess&#xD;
      healing. Additionally, a radiographic and clinical follow-up form will be filled out at each&#xD;
      of the following follow-up visits: 6 weeks, 14 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be identified in the clinic by an attending orthopaedic foot and ankle surgeon&#xD;
      or his physician assistant based on clinical exam and radiographic findings. Inclusion&#xD;
      criteria include anyone over age 18 who has end-stage subtalar arthritis and has failed&#xD;
      nonoperative management. Typically, these patients have multiple medical comorbidities and&#xD;
      therefore the exclusion criteria will be patients who are not healthy enough to undergo&#xD;
      surgery. Additional exclusion criteria include non-English speakers, and patients that are&#xD;
      blind, illiterate, or are prisoners. Additionally, pregnant women will be excluded. Patients&#xD;
      of all racial, religious, and cultural backgrounds will be included in this study.&#xD;

    <description>The Veterans RAND 12 Item Health Survey (VR-12, formerly called the Veterans SF-12) was Version Date 01.27.2020 3 developed from the Veterans RAND 36 (VR-36, formerly called the Veterans SF-36), which was modified from the original Medical Outcomes Survey (MOS) SF-36. The VR-12 measures Physical functioning (PF), social functioning (SF), role limitation due to physical problems (RP), role limitation due to emotional problems (RE), mental health (MH), energy and vitality (VT), bodily pain (BP) and general perception of health (GH). Standard based scoring (sometimes called norm based scoring) is used to calculate the physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) for both measures. The PCS and MCS are standardized using a t-score transformation and normed to a US population at a score of 50 and a standard deviation of 10.</description>

        Patients will be identified in the clinic by an attending orthopaedic foot and ankle&#xD;
        surgeon or his physician assistant based on clinical exam and radiographic findings.&#xD;
        Patients will be screened for eligibility by the research coordinator/ key personnel in&#xD;
        close coordination with the surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients at institute with end-stage talocalcaneal (subtalar) joint arthritis from any&#xD;
        etiology will be eligible to enroll in the study. Frequently, subtalar arthritis is caused&#xD;
        by trauma. Traumatic injuries have no predilection for race, religion, cultural background,&#xD;
        etc. Therefore, all demographic groups will have access to this study and should be&#xD;
        represented. Approximately 60 patients will be recruited for the study.&#xD;
