      Our study is to investigate the intra-rater reliability, inter-rater reliability and&#xD;
      concurrent validity of iPhone Measurement Applications to measure iliotibial band length in&#xD;
      individuals without iliotibial band-related pathology. The aim of this study is to evaluate&#xD;
      the intra-rater reliability, inter-rater reliability and concurrent validity of bubble&#xD;
      inclinometer and iPhone Measurement Applications in the evaluation of iliotibial band tension&#xD;
      in healthy individuals. This research is being done to determine if there are other more&#xD;
      reliable, valid or innovative technological ways to measure iliotibial band length.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A priori power analysis indicated that a minimum 16 or more participants should be enrolled&#xD;
      the study for a correlation of 0.7, with an α level of .05 and power of 95%. The study&#xD;
      protocol comply with the Declaration of Helsinki for Human Experimentation. Participants were&#xD;
      excluded if they had hip or knee surgery in the past year and iliotibial band syndrome. All&#xD;
      participants provide written informed consent. Permission for the study was obtained from KTO&#xD;
      Karatay University Faculty of Medicine Drug and Non-Medical Device Research Ethics Committee&#xD;
      with decision number 2019/012.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two experienced physiotherapists will evaluate the elasticity of both the dominant and&#xD;
      non-dominant iliotibial bands after 2 minutes of warm-up before the evaluation. Measurements&#xD;
      will be made by two physical therapists for each participant in different rooms without&#xD;
      seeing each other. The examiners will carry out three measurements for both extremities,&#xD;
      using both the bubble inclinometer and the iPhone® measurement app. A 5-minute passive rest&#xD;
      will be give between measurements. All evaluations will be first conducted by Examiner 1 and&#xD;
      then by Examiner 2. Measurement values will be record by a third physiotherapist. Data&#xD;
      obtained from both devices will be compare in terms of validity and reliability using&#xD;
      statistical analysis used in previous studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All inclinometric measurements will be do by two independent blind examiners (B.S.U. and&#xD;
      H.G.) and the range of motion (ROM) will be read directly from the devices by a third&#xD;
      examiner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the first measurement, the participant will be ask to warm up for five minutes. For&#xD;
      the measurement, the participant will be ask to lie on his side and flex the knee to 90&#xD;
      degrees. The examiner will stabilize the patient from the pelvis with one hand, and with the&#xD;
      other hand brought the flexed leg of the participant to abduction and extension. The Examiner&#xD;
      3 will be record the result by placing the device to be measured on the lateral projection of&#xD;
      the midpoint of the femur. By preserving the participant's position, measurements will be&#xD;
      make with the other device immediately and the values will bw record by the Examiner3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the first measurement, second and third measurements will be take at 2-minute passive&#xD;
      intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the participants will complete their first examiner evaluation, they will move to the&#xD;
      second examiner's room. The same protocol will be use for all measurements by the Examiner 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instruments We will use 2 devices to measure iliotibial band length; bubble inclinometer&#xD;
      (Baseline, Fabrication Enterprises Inc., New York) and iPhone® Measurement Applications&#xD;
      (Apple Inc, California). The iPhone® Measurement Applications measurements will make with the&#xD;
      iPhone 6s plus running IOS 13.3.1 (Apple Inc, California).&#xD;
