  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Left internal thoracic artery (LITA) has been acknowledged as the first graft of choice for&#xD;
      coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). However, it is still not conclusive which one is the&#xD;
      best second graft of choice among right internal thoracic artery, radial artery, right&#xD;
      gastroepiploic artery, saphenous vein, and etc., as well as its configuration for CABG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our institution, saphenous vein has been primarily used for the second graft and we have&#xD;
      harvested it with 'No touch technique'. We have been demonstrated the excellent long-term&#xD;
      patency of this 'No touch saphenous vein' in many studies. However, it is still unknown which&#xD;
      configuration is the better strategy for the saphenous vein as a Y-composite graft based on&#xD;
      the left internal thoracic artery versus an aortocoronary conduit. Thus, we aimed to evaluate&#xD;
      morphologic change of saphenous vein graft by 1-year intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) study&#xD;
      and angiographic patency results between Y-composite graft and aortocoronary conduit.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The enrolled patient underwent routine sternotomy, and left internal thoracic artery (LITA)&#xD;
      and saphenous vein (SV) are harvested. After harvest, the patient is randomized to&#xD;
      Y-composite group or aortocoronary group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Y-composite group, SV is anastomosed to LITA as Y-composite fashion. Then, LITA is&#xD;
      anastomosed to left anterior descending artery. SV is anastomosed to the rest of the target&#xD;
      vessels with sequential anastomosis technique (e.g. diagonal branch, obtuse marginal branch,&#xD;
      posterolateral branch and posteriori descending artery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For aortocoronary group, LITA is anastomosed to left anterior descending artery. Then, SV is&#xD;
      anastomosed to ascending aorta using proximal anastomosis assist device without clamping the&#xD;
      aorta. SV is anastomosed to the rest of the target vessels with sequential anastomosis&#xD;
      technique (e.g. diagonal branch, obtuse marginal branch, posterolateral branch and posteriori&#xD;
      descending artery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of anastomoses, residual portion of distal SV is collected for microscopic&#xD;
      evaluation and measurement of intima-media thickness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the 1-year follow-up, IVUS study, in addition to coronary angiography, is performed to&#xD;
      evaluate the morphologic changes and measure intima-media thickness of the saphenous vein&#xD;
      graft.&#xD;
