  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goals of this study are to provide a scientific understanding of recovery and relapse, as&#xD;
      well as to identify novel targets for future relapse prevention interventions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will characterize long-term trajectories of recovery from alcohol use including the&#xD;
      associated changes in psychosocial functioning and relapse status. By using an accelerated&#xD;
      longitudinal design, competing neurobehavioral decision systems (CNDS) functioning (measured&#xD;
      using delay discounting), psychosocial functioning, and relapse will be characterized over a&#xD;
      12-year period for individuals in alcohol use disorder (AUD) recovery.&#xD;

    <measure>CNDS functioning</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately every 3 months from date of baseline session through study completion, an average of 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Delay Discounting (DD) task will be administered to assesses the value of delayed reinforcers. Participants make hypothetical choices between amounts of delayed and immediate money at various delays (e.g., 1 day to 25 years)</description>

    <measure>Psychosocial Functioning- The Psychosocial Functioning Inventory (PFI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately every 3 months from date of baseline session through study completion, an average of 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Psychosocial Functioning Inventory (PFI) will be used to measure social functioning. The social behavior sub-scale will be calculated from 10 items of the PFI and included items that assess the frequency of problematic social behavior and social interactions in the past 90 days. The psychosocial functioning scale yields a score ranging from 0-100, with higher scores indicating greater impairment.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Psychosocial Functioning- World Health Organization (WHO)-Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately every 3 months from date of baseline session through study completion, an average of 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>WHO-Quality of Life brief assessment (BREF) will be used to measure the four domains of quality of life: (1) physical health; (2) psychological (3) social relationships; and (4) environment (26 items). Each item in the WHOQOL-BREF will be scored with a 5-point Likert scale (three items are reverse scored), and these scores will be used to generate raw scores for each domain, which will be then scaled 0-100, with higher scores indicating greater quality of life.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Psychosocial Functioning- Satisfaction with Life and social Functioning</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately every 3 months from date of baseline session through study completion, an average of 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Satisfaction with life and social functioning over the past 90 days will be assessed using 4 questions: How happy have you been (1) with life?; (2) with your living situation? and (3) with your relationships? and (4) Did you feel satisfied with leisure, social, and recreational activities? (0 = satisfied/happy; 1 = dissatisfied/unhappy)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Psychosocial Functioning- Career Engagement</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately every 3 months from date of baseline session through study completion, an average of 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Engagement in proactive career behaviors over time (9 items). Each item in the career engagement measure will be scored with the 5-point Likert-type scale. The average scale scores will range between 1-5 with higher score indicating greater engagement.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Psychosocial Functioning- Addiction Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately every 3 months from date of baseline session through study completion, an average of 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Addiction Severity Index (ASI) will be used to assess experiences of serious depression, serious anxiety or tension, and cognitive difficulty (i.e., trouble understanding, concentrating, or remembering) in the past 90 days. All items will be binary indicators, where 0 = employed or symptom not present and 1 = unemployed or symptom present. Items will be examined individually.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Alcohol Use- AUD Status and Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately every 3 months from date of baseline session through study completion, an average of 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-5 (DSM-5) AUD (last year &amp; last 3 months) will be used to assess AUD status and severity with mild, moderate, and severe sub-classifications</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Alcohol Use- Consumption</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately every 3 months from date of baseline session through study completion, an average of 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Timeline Follow Back-90 (TLFB-90) will be used to obtains retrospective daily estimates of alcohol consumption in the last 3 month. TLFB can generate a variety of variables that provide more precise and varied information (e.g., pattern, variability, drinking levels) about a person's drinking</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Adverse Social and emotional events</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately every 3 months from date of baseline session through study completion, an average of 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Inventory of Drug Taking Situations (IDTS-8) will be used to assess the frequency of common relapse-inducing events (i.e., negative affect, social pressure, physical discomfort, and drinking-related variables such as temptations, urges, and alcohol cues; 8 items)</description>
