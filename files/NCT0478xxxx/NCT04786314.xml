    <textblock>
      This study was planned as a randomized controlled study to determine the effect of hot and&#xD;
      cold water application on complaints and sleep quality in pregnant women with restless legs&#xD;
      syndrome (RLS). Pregnant women with a total of 90 RLS, including 30 people in each group,&#xD;
      will be included in the study. The data of this study will be collected by Personal&#xD;
      Information Form, RLS Diagnosis Criteria Questionnaire, RLS Severity Rating Scale, Pittsburgh&#xD;
      Sleep Quality Index, Post Application Follow-up Chart and Application Satisfaction Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While hot and cold water is applied in the intervention groups in the study, no application&#xD;
      other than routine maintenance and follow-up will be done to the control group.Data analysis&#xD;
      obtained in the research will be performed in TURCOSA statistical software (Turcosa Analytics&#xD;
      Ltd Co, Turkey, www.turcosa.com.tr).In comparisons, a value of p &lt;0.05 will be considered&#xD;
      statistically significant.In order to conduct the study, the necessary Academic Committee&#xD;
      decision, Ethics Committee approval (September 09, 2020 and number 2020/445) and&#xD;
      institutional permission were obtained. The individuals included in the study will be&#xD;
      informed about the purpose of the research, their verbal consent will be obtained and the&#xD;
      participant's informed consent form will be signed.&#xD;

    <description>The RLS Severity Rating Scale was developed in 2003 by the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group. The scale was applied in the selection of patients and in the weekly evaluation of RLS severity. The scale comprised ten questions; each question was scored between 0 and 4. Questions 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8 were related to RLS symptoms, questions 5, 9, and 10 were related to the effect of the disease on the mental state and daily social activities of patients with RLS, and question 3 was about the diagnostic criteria of RLS. The overall score indicated the RLS severity. A minimum score of 0 and a maximum score of 40 could be obtained. A score between 1 and 10 corresponded to &quot;mild,&quot; 11-20 &quot;moderate,&quot; 21-30 &quot;severe,&quot; and 31-40 &quot;very severe&quot; RLS.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline score at the end of one week</time_frame>
    <description>The form consists of a total of 24 questions. Each question is scored between 0 and 3. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score in the 0-21 range, with high scores indicating poor sleep quality. If the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index global score is greater than 5, it indicates that the sleep quality is significantly worse. The fact that the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score is above 5 indicates that the person has serious trouble in at least two areas related to his sleep, or that he has mild or moderate difficulty in more than three areas.</description>
