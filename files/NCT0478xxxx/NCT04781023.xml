      These treatments are beta-glucans, polysaccharides of beta-D-glucose that, can influence the&#xD;
      clearance of HPV infection. The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a gel&#xD;
      with Carboxymethyl - β -Glucan and polycarbophil when applied intravaginally regarding the&#xD;
      clearance of HPV infection.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection represents a significant source of morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality worldwide. High-risk oncogenic HPVs cause 99.7% of cervical cancers. 80% of&#xD;
      sexually active women will be infected with HPV at some point in their life. Most of these&#xD;
      infections are transitory and only if they are persistent and caused by a high-risk oncogenic&#xD;
      HPV are they an important risk factor for the development of cervical intraepithelial lesions&#xD;
      and invasive cervical cancer. Immunity plays a key factor in eliminating HPV infection. The&#xD;
      innate immune response constitutes the first line of defense against infection during the&#xD;
      early stages of infection, promoting a cytokine-mediated inflammatory response which links&#xD;
      innate immunity with the adaptive immune response. HPV evasion of these immune defense&#xD;
      mechanisms is critical for the persistence of the infection and leads to the development of&#xD;
      preneoplastic lesions and ultimately to cervical cancer. Through the use of adjuvant medical&#xD;
      treatments represents a therapeutic strategy to avoid the evasion mechanisms of HPV. One of&#xD;
      these most promising treatments is beta-glucans that seem capable of affecting the course of&#xD;
      HPV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification&#xD;
&#xD;
      β-glucans are a very diverse heterogeneous group of polysaccharides made up of D-glucose&#xD;
      monomers linked by β-type glycosidic bonds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      β-glucans have been previously described in bacteria, fungi, yeasts (including brewer's&#xD;
      yeast), plants and algae, where they play an important structural role in the cell wall or&#xD;
      reservoir.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are more than 6000 studies that have described the effects of glucans, mainly those of&#xD;
      β-1,3 bonds, such as anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. At least 4 receptors&#xD;
      have been identified in mammals for the recognition of these molecules: lactosylceramide,&#xD;
      scavengers, complement receptor 3 and dectin-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Commercial production of 1,3-β-glucans has been carried out by cultivating bacteria, yeasts,&#xD;
      fungi, and plants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies focusing on their influence on cytotoxic and helper T cells, APCs,&#xD;
      inflammatory pathways, and oxidative burst (using reactive oxygen species to kill cells) have&#xD;
      revealed that they may also have some anti-cancer properties. Some efforts have been made in&#xD;
      the field of cervical cancer prevention and it has been shown that β-glucans can also affect&#xD;
      HPV infection. Carboxymethyl β-glucan gel treatment was studied in a group of affected&#xD;
      individuals by CIN1. This case-control study demonstrated that it has an anti-cervical cancer&#xD;
      role in CIN1 regression. In 2010, two studies were conducted on the topic of &quot;the influence&#xD;
      of β-glucans&quot; on HPV-related lesions in the genital area. &quot;The first study found that&#xD;
      β-glucans can treat infection-related lesions and the second study revealed the efficacy of&#xD;
      beta-glucan treatment for HPVCIN1 lesions. These studies suggested that, in addition to the&#xD;
      anticancer effects of beta-glucans, they also have some effects on infection by HPV, the main&#xD;
      cause of cervical cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, the local treatment of vaginal problems has been known since ancient&#xD;
      times, and more recently it has been favored over oral treatments due to the achievement of&#xD;
      higher local concentrations of drugs and fewer interactions of the active principles and&#xD;
      interference with the gastrointestinal tract. Vaginal products are marketed in the form of&#xD;
      tablets, capsules, pessaries or ovules and semisolid forms (creams, ointments and gels),&#xD;
      being available as products for the treatment and prevention of vaginal infections.&#xD;
      Conventional dosage forms are associated with poor distribution and retention, primarily due&#xD;
      to the self-cleaning action of the vagina. Among the commercialized dosage forms, semisolids,&#xD;
      in particular gels, have been considered the preferred ones as they spread easily over the&#xD;
      vaginal surface area. Additionally, due to their high water content, they confer moisture and&#xD;
      lubrication effects that help alleviate the symptoms of conditions associated with vaginal&#xD;
      dryness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bioadhesion refers to the binding of natural or synthetic macromolecules to a biological&#xD;
      tissue. Mucoadhesion is considered a particular case of bioadhesion whenever the binding&#xD;
      occurs with mucous glycoproteins (mucin) or mucous membranes. The translation of these&#xD;
      concepts into pharmaceutical technology has been widely studied through the use of&#xD;
      bioadhesive polymers. Among the most used in vaginal formulations are polyacrylates (such as&#xD;
      carbomers and polycarbophils), cellulose derivatives (hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC),&#xD;
      hydroxypropylcellulose (HPC), hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC), etc.), chitosan,&#xD;
      hyaluronic acid and its derivatives, starch, pectin, natural gums and sodium alginate. In&#xD;
      addition to increasing the retention time of vaginal formulations, thus promoting therapeutic&#xD;
      duration and efficacy and improving patient comfort and adherence, these excipients also&#xD;
      allow controlled drug release, thus improving local pharmacokinetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Polycarbophil and carbomer (polyacrylate) vaginal applications have been specially studied in&#xD;
      vitro and in vivo, and have been included in various proprietary formulations as well as&#xD;
      actual marketed products. These polymers have the additional advantage of being acidic,&#xD;
      allowing the correction and maintenance of vaginal pH, and their acid-buffering capacity has&#xD;
      been explored as a strategy for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis and the prevention of&#xD;
      vaginosis recurrence for prevent the proliferation of pathogens, while promoting the&#xD;
      restoration of the protective flora of Lactobacillus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Polycarbophil, in particular, has been widely used for its bioadhesive properties, especially&#xD;
      after a 1-3% polycarbophil gel was shown to maintain vaginal acidity for 3-4 days after a&#xD;
      single application in postmenopausal women and A polycarbophil-carbomer vaginal gel was&#xD;
      proven in women with suspected and confirmed bacterial vaginosis to show a reduction in&#xD;
      vaginal pH in both trials, and a high clinical cure rate in confirmed vaginosis cases&#xD;
      compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a gel with Carboxymethyl - β&#xD;
      -Glucan and polycarbophil when applied intravaginally regarding the clearance of HPV&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
