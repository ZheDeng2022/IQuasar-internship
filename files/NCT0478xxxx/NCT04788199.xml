      This study is to investigate the rate of internal hernia after laparoscopic Rox-en-Y gastric&#xD;
      bypass when the defects are closed using cyano-acrylate glue.&#xD;

      Background Internal hernia complicated by bowel obstruction is a well-recognized complication&#xD;
      of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB). The present study aims to investigate the&#xD;
      role of cyanoacrylate glue in the prevention of internal hernia (IH) after LRYGB and compare&#xD;
      it with the open technique of managing mesenteric defects by leaving the mesentery intact&#xD;
      without closure of mesenteric defects. Data from six UK hospitals have been involved in this&#xD;
      study. Operations were done under the supervision of a single senior consultant surgeon of&#xD;
      bariatric surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods The prospectively collected data of 813 patients with morbid obesity who underwent&#xD;
      LRYGB were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were subdivided into two groups: group I&#xD;
      comprising 185 patients who had the mesenteric defects closed with cyanoacrylate glue and&#xD;
      group II comprising 628 patients who were managed by the open technique of leaving the&#xD;
      mesentery intact without closure of the mesenteric defects.&#xD;
