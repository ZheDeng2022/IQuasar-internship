    <textblock>
      This phase II trial investigates how easy it is to incorporate a nursing led geriatric&#xD;
      assessment screening tool into a busy oncology practice, in order to identify at-risk older&#xD;
      adults being evaluated for cancer treatment. This screening tool may help identify at-risk&#xD;
      patients who can be referred for more in depth assessment, allowing for the creation of an&#xD;
      individualized treatment plan that puts the patient's safety and personal goals as a&#xD;
      priority.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the feasibility of training nurses to administer the Geriatric 8 (G8)&#xD;
      screening tool in an oncology practice, to identify older patients (&gt; 65 years old [y/o])&#xD;
      that would benefit from a more extensive Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To report the positive predictive value of the G8 screening tool with the final frailty&#xD;
      designation determined by the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment completed in patients&#xD;
      referred to the Senior Adult Oncology Center (SAOC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE I:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Registered Nurses receive training on how to administer the G8 screening tool utilizing an&#xD;
      Epic flowsheet to patients using a self-directed education module and by direct assessment by&#xD;
      a geriatrician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE II:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients complete the G8 screening tool questionnaire over 10 minutes as part of their&#xD;
      standard initial assessment, and their answers are entered into their electronic health&#xD;
      record (EHR) flowsheet. Patients who score =&lt; 14 on the G8 are referred for a CGA at SAOC,&#xD;
      and these patients and their medical oncologists are made aware. Within 2 weeks of the&#xD;
      initial screening, the results are communicated with the patient and medical oncologist at a&#xD;
      2-hour SAOC visit. Patients with a score of &gt; 15 on the G8 are made aware of their results&#xD;
      without any referral generated.&#xD;
