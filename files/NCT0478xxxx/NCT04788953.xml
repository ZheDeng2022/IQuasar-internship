  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this research study the investigators want to learn more about whether the medication&#xD;
      Solriamfetol improves daytime sleepiness in workers who start work at very early times&#xD;
      (between 3 and 6am).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Shift work has become increasingly common as the 24/7 global society has required more and&#xD;
      more workers to do their jobs at irregular hours. According to the National Health Interview&#xD;
      Survey in 2010, approximately 28.7% of the American workforce is engaged in work outside a&#xD;
      regular day shift (outside 7 AM-to 6 PM). Working irregular hours poses a serious threat to&#xD;
      the shift worker's physical, mental, and psychosocial health due to circadian misalignment&#xD;
      and misplaced sleep. The most severe problems faced by shift workers are sleep disturbances&#xD;
      and excessive sleepiness. The disruptions caused by shift work are recognized as a circadian&#xD;
      rhythm sleep disorder in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 3rd Edition,&#xD;
      and is called Shift Work Disorder [SWD]. SWD is characterized by excessive sleepiness (ES)&#xD;
      during wakefulness, accompanied by a reduction of total sleep time and/or insomnia. Several&#xD;
      studies have shown that 10-43% of shift workers are diagnosed with SWD, dependent on the&#xD;
      criteria used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have shown that wake promoting agents can be used to treat ES in shift workers,&#xD;
      ranging from caffeine to prescription pharmacological agents. Current Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA)-approved options for SWD patients with ES are modafinil and armodafinil.&#xD;
      A three-month, double-blind trial of 209 randomized SWD patients showed that modafinil&#xD;
      improves wakefulness and the ability to sustain attention working night shifts without&#xD;
      negatively affecting daytime sleep. Furthermore, SWD patients who received modafinil had an&#xD;
      improvement in clinical symptoms, reduced levels of sleepiness during night shift and during&#xD;
      commute home, and proportionally fewer patients reported motor vehicle accidents or near&#xD;
      accidents while commuting home. Czeisler and colleagues also performed a 12-week randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study, which showed that&#xD;
      armodafinil was well-tolerated and improved clinical conditions, wakefulness, attention and&#xD;
      memory during night shifts in SWD patients without jeopardizing daytime sleep and reduced&#xD;
      sleepiness during the commute home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All these previous studies were described in SWD patients working night shifts, yet&#xD;
      approximately 3 times as many individuals work shifts that start in the early morning&#xD;
      compared with those who work night shifts. These early-morning shift workers are a unique,&#xD;
      high-risk group because their early work start times (3:00 AM to 6:00 AM) require the workers&#xD;
      to wake up in the middle of the night, close to their circadian nadir, resulting in curtailed&#xD;
      sleep and commuting to work during times of high sleepiness. Previous research has shown that&#xD;
      early-morning shift starts in particular are associated with increased sleepiness. To the&#xD;
      investigators' knowledge, no studies have addressed the use of wake promoting agents for ES&#xD;
      in early-morning shift workers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this clinical trial, the investigators will test whether Solriamfetol (SUNOSITM), a drug&#xD;
      approved for the treatment of ES in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and&#xD;
      narcolepsy, is effective in: (1) decreasing sleepiness without reducing sleep duration or&#xD;
      sleep quality; (2) improving work functioning; and (3) improving quality of life in&#xD;
      early-morning shift workers diagnosed with ES associated with SWD.&#xD;
