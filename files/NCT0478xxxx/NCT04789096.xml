  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women or men with HER2-positive, metastatic breast cancer, who have progressed on previous&#xD;
      treatment, will receive tucatinib in combination with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pembrolizumab and trastuzumab (PD-L1 positive); or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pembrolizumab, trastuzumab and capecitabine (PD-L1 negative)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite significant advances in systemic treatment options, advanced HER2-positive breast&#xD;
      cancer post treatment with trastuzumab, pertuzumab and T-DM1 still remains incurable, with&#xD;
      brain metastases remaining a major cause of patient morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HER2-positive breast cancers have relatively high tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) that&#xD;
      may be targeted with immune checkpoint blockade. Studies in metastatic breast cancer with PD1&#xD;
      or PD-L1 inhibition have shown an overall survival (OS) benefit for those that are enriched&#xD;
      for pre-existing immunity, such as positive expression of PD-L1 protein or TILs present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the main areas of disease progression in HER2 positive disease is in the central&#xD;
      nervous system (CNS), supporting the need to find an effective combination for patients with&#xD;
      brain metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tucatinib (ONT-380) is a potent, highly selective, oral HER2 small molecule tyrosine kinase&#xD;
      inhibitor (TKI) with demonstrated clinical benefit notable for its minimal inducement of&#xD;
      EGFR-type toxicities when administered in combination-type studies including proven&#xD;
      intra-cranial efficacy in studies of patients with brain metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesise that the combination of tucatinib with trastuzumab and PD-1&#xD;
      inhibition will result in a similar ORR as that seen in HER2CLIMB, along with comparable PFS&#xD;
      and duration of response, particularly through prevention and treatment of CNS metastases.&#xD;
      The advantage of adding PD-1 inhibition and omitting capecitabine in the PD-L1 positive group&#xD;
      is to increase the durability of the response, with hopefully less added toxicity for&#xD;
      patients. The investigators believe this regimen will result in comparable outcomes as those&#xD;
      seen in HER2CLIMB, with fewer adverse events. In the PD-L1 negative cohort, the HER2CLIMB&#xD;
      regimen (tucatinib + capecitabine) will be used with the addition of pembrolizumab with the&#xD;
      hypothesis that its anti-tumour activity may overcome the lower immunogenicity of this&#xD;
      subgroup. Importantly, the side effect profiles of all agents in the proposed combination are&#xD;
      non-overlapping and this combination provides a unique opportunity for excellent tolerability&#xD;
      and durable disease control in this patient group.&#xD;
