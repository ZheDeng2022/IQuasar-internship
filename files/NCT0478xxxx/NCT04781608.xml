  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Impairments in hearing and/or vision are common in older age. Having lived one's life as a&#xD;
      fully sighted and hearing individual, older adults with sensory loss must come to terms with&#xD;
      their declining capacity to interact with others and waning independence. There is ample&#xD;
      research evidence showing that sensory loss (i.e., loss of hearing, vision or both) can be a&#xD;
      distressful experience for older adults and their spouses, yet little has been done to&#xD;
      understand what works in alleviating this distress or develop scalable cost-effective&#xD;
      interventions to counter this distress or associated outcomes like depression, anxiety, poor&#xD;
      quality of life, and lower relationship quality. In this project, the investigators will&#xD;
      design and test an easy-to-administer, online intervention aimed at reducing emotional and&#xD;
      marital distress in older adults with sensory loss and their spouses. The goal of the&#xD;
      intervention will be to develop acceptance of the sensory loss through a series of Acceptance&#xD;
      and Commitment Therapy inspired educational, self-compassion, and therapeutic activities. In&#xD;
      prior research, acceptance has been flagged as a promising factor on which to intervene to&#xD;
      assist older couples' emotional and marital recovery in the context of sensory loss. Thus,&#xD;
      the investigators expect that the intervention should show encouraging results regarding the&#xD;
      alleviation of distress in this group and contribute significantly to the psychosocial&#xD;
      rehabilitation of older adults with sensory loss and their spouses.&#xD;
