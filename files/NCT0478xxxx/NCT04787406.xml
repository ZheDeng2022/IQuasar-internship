  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study sought to examine the efficacy of single session transcranial direct&#xD;
      current stimulation applied over the primary motor cortex in people with Parkinson's disease&#xD;
      on sequential motor learning performance.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease is characterised by deficits of motor control triggered by impaired basal&#xD;
      ganglia function, such as bradykinesia and tremor. Beyond the visibly recognisable motor&#xD;
      symptoms of Parkinson's disease, the ability to learn a sequence of movements is also&#xD;
      compromised and poses a significant barrier to effective rehabilitation. In healthy&#xD;
      individuals, transcranial direct current stimulation applied over the primary motor cortex&#xD;
      during motor task practice has been shown to significantly improve motor learning compared to&#xD;
      placebo conditions. The present study sought to examine the effect of a single session of&#xD;
      transcranial direct current stimulation applied over the primary motor cortex in people with&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease on sequential motor learning performance. Participants learnt two finger&#xD;
      tapping sequences, with task difficulty indexed by sequence length, and task consolidation&#xD;
      further examined using a dual-task paradigm. Task related cortical haemodynamic activity was&#xD;
      recorded using functional near-infrared spectroscopy.&#xD;

    <description>Anodal electrode (35 cm2 sponge electrode) placed over C3. Cathodal electrode (35 cm2 sponge electrode) placed over the right supraorbital area.

    <intervention_name>Transcranial direct current stimulation</intervention_name>
    <description>Transcranial electrical stimulation device. A weak direct electrical current, up to 2 mA, is passed between two electrodes placed on the scalp. Electrodes are housed in 35 cm2 sponges saturated with 4 ml of saline solution (0.9 % NaCl) per side, per pad.&#xD;
Stimulation is phased in with a 30 second ramp up period prior to the specified stimulation period and phased-out with a ramp down of the current following the specified stimulation period. For sham stimulation, the ramp-up and ramp-down periods are retained, but stimulation is switched off for during the specified stimulation period.</description>
