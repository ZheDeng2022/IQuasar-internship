      Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess postoperative pain in prospective randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial comparing Reciproc or hand instrument and also different obturation techniques&#xD;
      in one visit of endodontic retreatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional root canal treatment was done to 45 patients who needed retreatment. All&#xD;
      instruments used in this study are routinely used instrument in endodontic therapy. After&#xD;
      completed root canal treatment, the patients asked the intense of post operative pain.&#xD;

      Materials and metods: The study was included 45 patients (18-65 yrs old) who needed&#xD;
      endodontic retreatment in mandibular premolar or molar without any symptoms. The teeth had&#xD;
      been randomly assign into 3 groups according to the instrumentation or obturation techniques;&#xD;
      hand files with lateral condensation, Reciproc with lateral condensation, or Reciproc with&#xD;
      continuous condensation technique. Retreatments had performed in a single visit. Coronal&#xD;
      restorations were removed, the gutta-percha were extracted using either Reciproc or hand&#xD;
      files. After, biochemical and mechanical praparation, the canals were filled with&#xD;
      gutta-percha cones and AH Plus sealer using the lateral condensation or continuous wave of&#xD;
      obturation technique. Participants were been asked to rate the incidence and intensity of the&#xD;
      postoperative pain on a verbal rating scale 24h, 48h and 72h and 7 days after retreatment.&#xD;
      All data were analyzed using (Chi-square test, p=0,05)&#xD;

    <description>The patient usually takes anaesthesia before treatment and access cavity was prepared on the tooth and root canal removed and instrumented and obturated. However, in the present study, previously done root canal was retreated. Usually no anaesthesia was used because all root canals were done before. So just instrumentation and obturation was done.</description>
