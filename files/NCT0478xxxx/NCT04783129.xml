      The objective of this study is to compare the effects of two similar long-term&#xD;
      interprofessional programs, one of them delivers by in-person classes, and another delivers&#xD;
      by online classes on the quality of life of people with Parkinson's.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: People with PD will be randomized into 3 groups: (1) Face-to-face group, in which&#xD;
      participants, in groups of 10 persons, followed a multidisciplinary health education program&#xD;
      composed of 10 monthly face-to-face lectures; (2) Remote group, in which individuals followed&#xD;
      the same lectures delivered by online; and (3) Control group, in which participants followed&#xD;
      no lecture. The participants will be evaluated before (BED) and after (ABP) the education&#xD;
      program conclusion (10 lectures). Health quality of life was adopted as a primary outcome.&#xD;
      Independence in daily living activities, motor and non-motor symptoms severity, and global&#xD;
      cognitive capacity was adopted as secondary measures, Besides, all participants will be asked&#xD;
      to answer a survey to evaluate the knowledge improvement of key learning points of lectures.&#xD;
      The results will be analyzed by ANOVA for repeated measures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease is a large cause of disability worldwide. The complex combination of&#xD;
      motor and non-motor symptoms brings an increasing impairment in functionality and,&#xD;
      consequently, a progressively decrease in the quality of life of the people living with PD&#xD;
      and their families. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that for health care,&#xD;
      especially in chronic diseases, care should be centered on the person (people-centered care).&#xD;
      This model enlarges the focus on biological aspects, including psychological and social&#xD;
      aspects, building a multidimensional perspective on an individual, which can only be reached&#xD;
      by integrated and interprofessional care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to this model, education is crucial to empower the person to occupy an active role&#xD;
      in the health process, gaining greater control over decisions and actions affecting their&#xD;
      health. Patient empowerment has been associated with positive health and clinical outcomes,&#xD;
      including improved disease management, effective use of health services, improved health&#xD;
      status, and medication adherence. However, there are several barriers for participants to&#xD;
      attending this kind of program. Reasons for nonparticipation include mobility-reducing&#xD;
      physical health issues, time constraints, distance, insufficient funds, lack of respite care&#xD;
      if caring for someone else, and transportation. Thus, using a home-based video class may be&#xD;
      one opportunity to reduce these known barriers and improve the accessibility of education&#xD;
      programs. This delivery strategy can be beneficial for no high-income countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The objective of this study is to compare the effects of two similar long-term&#xD;
      interprofessional programs, one of them delivers by in-person classes, and another delivers&#xD;
      by online classes on the quality of life of people with Parkinson's.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: People with a confirmed diagnosis of Idiopathic Parkinson's disease, in stage 1-4 of&#xD;
      disease evolution according to Hoehn and Yahr classification will be randomized into 3&#xD;
      groups: (1) Face-to-face group (FFG), in which participants, in groups of 10 persons,&#xD;
      followed a multidisciplinary health education program composed of 10 monthly face-to-face&#xD;
      lectures; (2) Remote group (RG), in which individuals followed the same lectures delivered by&#xD;
      online; and (3) Control group (CG), in which participants followed no lecture. People who&#xD;
      have severe cognitive decline and uncorrected visual or hearing impairment will be excluded.&#xD;
      Participants from both groups will be instructed to follow their usual routine for the&#xD;
      treatment of the disease. The lectures on the management of motor and non-motor alterations&#xD;
      associate with PD will be offered by a nurse, physiotherapist, occupational therapist, speech&#xD;
      therapist, neurologist, lawyer, nutritionist, and psychologist. The participants will be&#xD;
      evaluated before (BED) and after (ABP) the education program conclusion (10 lectures). Health&#xD;
      quality of life, adopted as a primary outcome, will be evaluated by Parkinson´s disease&#xD;
      questionnaire 39 (PDQ-39). The independence in daily living activities, motor and non-motor&#xD;
      symptoms severity, and global cognitive capacity, adopted as secondary measures, will be&#xD;
      evaluated by Unified Parkinson´s disease rating scale (UPDRS) and Montreal Cognitive&#xD;
      Assessment (MoCA), respectively. Besides, all participants will be asked to answer a survey&#xD;
      to evaluate the knowledge improvement of key learning points of lectures. The survey&#xD;
      consisted of 20 questions (2 per lecture) where the minimum level (score 0) indicated the&#xD;
      absence of knowledge and maximal level (score 5) indicated the full understanding of&#xD;
      lectures' key points. The results will be analyzed by ANOVA for repeated measures considering&#xD;
      as factor group (FFG, RG, CG) and assessment points (BED, AEP).&#xD;

    <description>Parkinson´s disease questionnaire 39 (PDQ-39), PDQ-39 is a widely used and acknowledged disease-specific, self-reported questionnaire. It contains 39 questions covering eight distinct domains: mobility, activities of daily living, emotional wellbeing, stigma, social support, cognition, communication, and bodily discomfort. The score for each question ranges from 0 to 4 points, with higher scores indicating higher levels of perceived problems. A change of ≥1.6 points on the PDQ-39 total score after 6 months represents a minimally clinically important difference</description>

Each item scores from 0 (normal) to 4 (severe) and total scores are obtained from the sum of the corresponding item scores for each part.</description>
