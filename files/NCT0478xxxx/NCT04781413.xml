  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we combine Nab-PTX, S-1 and sintilimab as adjuvant regimen to patients with&#xD;
      stage IIIC GC. We are aiming to investigate the recommended dose of this regimen in a phase I&#xD;
      study and estimate the toxicity and efficacy of this regimen in a phase II study.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The phase I study is a dose-escalation study using a standard 3+3 design. The regimen&#xD;
      involves 3-week cycles with escalated doses of nab-paclitaxel (80-120 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8)&#xD;
      and fixed doses of sintilimab (200 mg on day 1) and S-1 (based on body-surface area on day 1&#xD;
      to 14). The primary endpoints are safety and determination the recommended dose in the&#xD;
      subsequent phase II study. In the phase II trial, the primary endpoint is 3-year relapse-free&#xD;
      survival (RFS). Secondary endpoints are 5-year overall survival (OS), 3-year OS, 5-year RFS,&#xD;
      and quality of life. Exploratory endpoint is time to peritoneal metastasis. Adverse events&#xD;
      are monitored and graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events&#xD;
      version 4.0.&#xD;

Level Nab-PTX S-1 Sintilimab&#xD;
80 mg/m2 80mg/m2 200mg&#xD;
100 mg/m2 80mg/m2 200mg&#xD;
120 mg/m2 80mg/m2 200mg&#xD;
We start at level 1. The recommended dose (RD) is defined as dose equal to the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). If 1 of three patients experiences dose-limiting toxicities (DLT), three more patients will be enrolled at the same dose level. The MTD is defined as the dose level at which two or more of three patients, or at least two of 4-6 patients, have DLTs during one cycle.</description>
