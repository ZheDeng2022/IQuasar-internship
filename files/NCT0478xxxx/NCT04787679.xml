  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to the increase in the average age of the population, the projections on the number of&#xD;
      age-dependent bone fractures appear to be constantly increasing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They are mainly due to bone pathologies, including osteoporosis. The latter leads to a&#xD;
      reduction in bone mineral density and deterioration of the micro-architecture, with a&#xD;
      consequent increase in bone fragility. However, the mechanisms of damage at the micro-scale&#xD;
      have not yet been elucidated and there is no universally recognized damage criterion. Recent&#xD;
      research has evaluated the importance of implementing computational models to study the&#xD;
      influence of bone gaps, canaliculi and microporosities on the propagation of damage. These&#xD;
      models need to be validated through experimental tests, still lacking, in particular on human&#xD;
      bones, in the current scientific landscape. Once the experimental validation of computational&#xD;
      models has been developed, it will be possible to introduce new fracture indices at the&#xD;
      micro-scale, useful for a preventive diagnosis of osteoporosis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study of the mechanisms of bone damage, which occur at the multiscale, is of fundamental&#xD;
      importance for the understanding of fracture processes. In particular, age-related fractures&#xD;
      are continuously increasing due to the increase in average age and widespread diseases such&#xD;
      as osteoporosis. They result in high economic burdens, morbidity (including psychological,&#xD;
      e.g., frailty), and increased mortality. In order to reduce the impact of bone fractures on&#xD;
      health and economy, early diagnosis is the key. In this context, one must consider that bone&#xD;
      is characterized by a complex hierarchical structure. Both the cortical and trabecular&#xD;
      sections consist of micrometric lamellae, composed of collagen fibrils, within which&#xD;
      osteocytes are found. They reside in sub-micrometer cavities called lacunae, which are&#xD;
      connected by a dense network of canaliculi. At the nanoscale, the fibrils consist primarily&#xD;
      of collagen and hydroxyapatite crystals. This complex architecture is reflected in fracture&#xD;
      patterns: damage, in fact, occurs at the multiscale. However, fracture patterns and their&#xD;
      associated physical phenomena are still not understood, especially at the microscale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, microscale imaging techniques have been combined with subject-specific numerical&#xD;
      models, which are able to calculate local values of bone stress and strain. Preliminary&#xD;
      studies have focused on evaluating a possible interaction between micro-cracks and&#xD;
      microstructural porosity. This particular research focuses on the lacunar network, which is&#xD;
      presumed to significantly affect bone resistance to fracture although the actual role of the&#xD;
      lacunar network is not yet elucidated. First, lacunae are areas of stress concentration,&#xD;
      which apparently lead to weakening of the bone structure. However, in most cases, the lacunae&#xD;
      make a positive contribution to toughness by deflecting the crack front. The connection&#xD;
      between the lacunae, determined by the network of canaliculi, is also reduced in osteoporotic&#xD;
      subjects, preventing the slowing of damage. In this sense, bone can be considered a damage&#xD;
      tolerant material. Donaldson et al developed computational models and estimated a threshold&#xD;
      for microdamage initiation and propagation. They used computerized micro-tomography of murine&#xD;
      femurs and evaluated the influence of different algorithms on the propagation of in-silico&#xD;
      damage. Further results showed that the damage always occurs on the surfaces of blood vessels&#xD;
      or porosities and does not instead start from the lacunae. However, further simulations and&#xD;
      models would be needed to verify the effectiveness of the damage models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Computational damage models also require experimental validation. Preliminary studies have&#xD;
      been conducted in two main directions: in-vivo imaging and image-guided failure assessment&#xD;
      (IGFA) techniques. The first approach allows nondestructive monitoring of bone damage in&#xD;
      living animals. The second approach, implemented by A. Levchuk et al. (8), shows enormous&#xD;
      potential by allowing the study of microcrack initiation and propagation with sub-micrometer&#xD;
      resolution, but only on small animals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current research for the first time wants to perform tests on human bone samples applying&#xD;
      IGFA techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite several studies on the characterization of damage models at the micro-scale, a&#xD;
      validation of computational models of fracture on human subjects is still lacking. In&#xD;
      addition, the role of morphological features at the micro-scale in samples is still unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These micro-scale studies could improve clinical understanding of bone fracture and&#xD;
      prediction of fracture risk. Currently, clinicians use bone mineral density, which is a&#xD;
      macro-scale parameter, as the most common predictor of bone fracture. However, recent studies&#xD;
      demonstrate the importance of a thorough characterization of the geometric and morphologic&#xD;
      characteristics of the microarchitecture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Objective The study aims at the experimental validation of computational models of&#xD;
      bone damage at the micro-scale. The general objective is pursued by controlled damage in a&#xD;
      micro-compression machine on human bone samples from femoral head. The machinery is placed&#xD;
      inside a synchrotron.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective The primary objective of the present study is to evaluate the difference in&#xD;
      the attraction of bone damage with respect to gaps in the two groups considered (osteoporotic&#xD;
      and non-osteoporotic) following micro-compression testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The discriminating parameter chosen turns out to be the number of bone gaps encountered by&#xD;
      micro-damage. We expect to observe an effect size of 0.4 between the two groups with respect&#xD;
      to the chosen parameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determination of the role of gaps, canaliculi and other bone microstructures in damage.&#xD;
           Human bone samples are scanned by micro-tomograph for the definition of microstructural&#xD;
           morphological parameters and the realization and analysis of numerical models.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Validation of these numerical models of damage by micro-compression tests carried out in&#xD;
           situ in a synchrotron of adequate resolution&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quantification of damage in human bone samples affected by osteoporosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Definition of micro-scale fracture indices, useful for the early diagnosis of&#xD;
           osteoporosis&#xD;
