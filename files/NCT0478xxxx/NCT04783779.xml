  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single site, prospective, single arm evaluation of the safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness of the Healionics STARgraft-2 hemodialysis access graft. STARgraft devices have&#xD;
      been demonstrated in preclinical and other studies to have improved resistance to the common&#xD;
      failure modes of venous anastomosis stenosis and infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is an extension from a prior First in Human (FIH) study (NCT03916731) with the&#xD;
      STARgraft AV investigational device. That study also included control implants of&#xD;
      commercially available standard ePTFE grafts approved for the same use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is enrolling patients with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis&#xD;
      via a prosthetic vascular graft. The study proposes to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the performance of the investigational STARgraft-2 compared to the ePTFE&#xD;
           controls in the prior study and to published results, over a period of 6 months, with&#xD;
           extended results to 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Verify safety of the STARgraft-2 multilayer construction in extended dialysis vascular&#xD;
           access use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is intended to enroll 25 subjects in this study.&#xD;
