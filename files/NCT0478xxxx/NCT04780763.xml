    <masking_description>The study Test and Control products have been developed in order to guarantee the blinding, they will be similar by their taste, texture, color, packaging, nutritional content and flavor.&#xD;
The blinding of study products will be performed by assigning a study product number corresponding to the randomization list. Then blinded study product packages will then be carried to the investigational site for assignment to the subject.&#xD;
Product allocation will be performed by randomized method (IWRS validated system) as a Randomized Controlled Trial. The participants are thus assigned to intervention groups randomly.</masking_description>
