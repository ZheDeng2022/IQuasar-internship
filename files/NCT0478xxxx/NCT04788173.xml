  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cirrhosis is defined anatomically as a diffuse process with fibrosis and nodule formation. It&#xD;
      is the result of the fibrogenesis that occurs with chronic liver injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lipoproteins are complexes of lipid and proteins that are essential for transport of soluble&#xD;
      vitamins Liver cells play a serious task in the regulation of lipid metabolism. The principal&#xD;
      location for lipoprotein and cholesterol synthesis is in the liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In healthy individuals, a compound equilibrium is preserved between utilization,&#xD;
      biosynthesis, and transfer of lipid fractions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many diseases that affect the parenchyma can lead to changes in the structure of lipoproteins&#xD;
      and transport throughout the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, in cirrhotic patients, the metabolism of lipid is changed such that glycogen&#xD;
      stores are significantly diminished, contributing to malnutrition and biolysis.&#xD;

      Cirrhosis is defined anatomically as a diffuse process with fibrosis and nodule formation. It&#xD;
      is the result of the fibrogenesis that occurs with chronic liver injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lipoproteins are complexes of lipid and proteins that are essential for transport of soluble&#xD;
      vitamins Liver cells play a serious task in the regulation of lipid metabolism. The principal&#xD;
      location for lipoprotein and cholesterol synthesis is in the liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In healthy individuals, a compound equilibrium is preserved between utilization,&#xD;
      biosynthesis, and transfer of lipid fractions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many diseases that affect the parenchyma can lead to changes in the structure of lipoproteins&#xD;
      and transport throughout the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, in cirrhotic patients, the metabolism of lipid is changed such that glycogen&#xD;
      stores are significantly diminished, contributing to malnutrition and biolysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The preceding studies have reported that cirrhotic patients have abnormal metabolism of&#xD;
      lipids, especially reduction in cholesterol level and hypobetalipoproteinemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These alterations develop together with the progression of liver disease and may be&#xD;
      considered as a prognostic markers for liver decompensation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maneuvers concerned with the decline of lipid particles in patients with cirrhosis are&#xD;
      compound and need multiple researches for complete understanding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protein microsomal triglyceride (TG) transfer protein -+ MTP], enzymatic (acylCoA:&#xD;
      cholesterol acyltransferase), and apoprotein (Apo AI) reduction are considered to be linked&#xD;
      to these changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Owing to the wide occurrence of liver disease in Egypt, we made this study to assess lipid&#xD;
      profile in cirrhotic patients and to evaluate its relation to the degree of cirrhosis.&#xD;
