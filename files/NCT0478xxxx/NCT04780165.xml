      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To evaluate efficacy of Blephademodex eyelid hygiene wipe treatment with a subsequent&#xD;
      maintenance period with Blephaclean lid cleansing wipes in Demodex blepharitis, as assessed&#xD;
      by the change in ocular symptoms by a Global Discomfort Scale (GDS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the efficacy of Blephademodex eyelid hygiene wipe treatment in Demodex&#xD;
           blepharitis as assessed by the change alone and in combination with a subsequent&#xD;
           maintenance period of treatment with Blephaclean eyelid cleansing wipes ocular symptoms&#xD;
           by: adapted TOSS; SANDE; specific blepharitis symptoms; Demodex count; ocular surface&#xD;
           redness (Efron scale); lid margin redness/swelling (Efron / custom scale); Dandruff&#xD;
           coverage at bases of eyelashes; ocular surface staining (Oxford scale; corneal only)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate subject and physician satisfaction with Blephademodex eyelid hygiene wipes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate ease of use for Blephademodex eyelid hygiene wipes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse events are documented and analyzed.&#xD;

    <description>Change from Baseline at Day 28 The Global (overall) discomfort score (GDS) consists of a single question, which can be answered by the subject by choosing a value between 0 (no discomfort) and 10 (worst discomfort): Thinking about today, how would you rate the discomfort of your eyes?</description>

    <description>Symptoms will be rated by the patient on the day of visit using 10-grade scales (0 = none to 10 = severe) for each of the following items Severity of any eyelid itching today / Severity of lid redness today / Severity of eyelid swelling today / How severe was the eyelid crusting this morning when you woke up? / How severe is missing lashes today?</description>

    <measure>adapted Total Ocular Symptom Score (TOSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 56</time_frame>
    <description>8-item questionnaire with an overall score ranging from 0 (&quot;none of the time&quot;) to 4 (&quot;all of the time&quot;). It contains of a single question concerning the frequency with which 8 different symptoms (itchy eyelids, eyelid redness, red eyes generally, swollen (puffy) eyes, tearing (eyes watering), crusting around the lashes, burning or stinging sensations and noticed eyelash loss) were experienced in the course of a week.</description>

    <measure>Symptom Assessment in Dry Eye (SANDE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 56</time_frame>
    <description>Comprised of two questions: 1) How often do your eyes feel dry and/or irritated? And 2) How severe you feel your symptoms of dryness and/or irritation are? This questionnaire uses a 100 mm horizontal line as visual analogue scale (VAS) for each question to assess ocular discomfort and/or dryness experienced by the patients. In the SANDE questionnaire, frequency of symptoms ranges from &quot;rarely&quot; to &quot;all of the time&quot; and the severity of symptoms ranges from &quot;very mild&quot; to &quot;very severe&quot;.</description>

    <description>During the first 28 days of the trial, subjects will use one Blephademodex® eyelid hygiene wipe every evening per eye to clean the eyelids of both their eyes. At the start of the second period the Investigator will assess based on the GDS if the condition is resolved and manage accordingly: subjects will either continue with this regime if GDS is unchanged (further treatment phase) or revert to Blephaclean wipes every evening instead (maintenance phase), again to clean the eyelids of both their eyes.</description>
