    <textblock>
      The prevalence of chronic widespread pain (CWP) in individuals infected with the human&#xD;
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) includes regional and widespread musculoskeletal pain of&#xD;
      neuropathic and inflammatory nature. HIV-related CWP leads to 10x greater odds of functional&#xD;
      impairment. However, the specific mechanisms that contribute to CWP in HIV are not&#xD;
      understood. Thus, pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches to mitigate CWP have had&#xD;
      minimal benefits, contributing to an overreliance on opioids and alarming rise in addiction&#xD;
      and overdose. The overall objective of this study is to address the gap in the knowledge of&#xD;
      the pathogenesis of HIV-related CWP. Specifically, the role of impaired endogenous opioid&#xD;
      synthesis/release from leukocytes in people with HIV (PWH) who self-report CWP will be&#xD;
      explored. Leukocytes (neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, and lymphocytes) are a rich source&#xD;
      of opioid peptides (Met-enkephalin, dynorphin A, β-endorphin) that inhibit nociception by&#xD;
      binding to peripheral opioid receptors. Therefore, to establish whether decreased peripheral&#xD;
      opioid peptides correlate with experimental pain measures in PWH with self-reported CWP,&#xD;
      quantitative sensory testing (QST) will be completed before and after administration of&#xD;
      methylnaltrexone bromide (RELISTOR), a clinically available, peripherally acting opioid&#xD;
      receptor antagonist.&#xD;

Heat Pain - 1) A slowly increasing heat stimulus (44°C, 46°C, and 48°C) will be delivered; 2) a series of 5 heat pulses (about 2 sec) will be given and pain will be rated (0-100)&#xD;

Pressure Pain Threshold. A slowly increasing pressure will be applied on forearm and shoulder with a probe (Algomed) till pain is felt. Then constant pressure will be applied till the sensation first becomes painful to assess threshold in kilopascals&#xD;
Combined Pressure and Cold Pain. Hand will be immersed in cold water (10°C). After 30 sec, pain intensity will be rated (0-100).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Confirmed HIV diagnosis and currently a patient in the UAB 1917 HIV Clinic&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 19 - 65; the lower end of this age range was chosen to capture young adults with&#xD;
             HIV infection, and participants over 65 years are increasingly likely to meet one or&#xD;
             more exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All people living with HIV must be currently receiving stable antiretroviral therapy&#xD;
             (ART) for inclusion in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-HIV participants must be confirmed as HIV negative. HIV-negative participants with&#xD;
             chronic widespread pain must self-report bodily pain more than once per week for at&#xD;
             least three consecutive months and HIV-negative participants without chronic pain must&#xD;
             self-report no pain, or pain less frequently than once per week for at least three&#xD;
             consecutive months&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anemia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current or past history of blood disorders which may increase hemolysis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active microbial infections which may alter the quantity or quality of blood&#xD;
             inflammatory cells such as monocytes and neutrophils&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of certain medication other than antiretroviral therapy that might conflict with&#xD;
             study observations. However, participants will not be excluded or asked to withdraw&#xD;
             from medications used for pain management since temporary withdrawal from these&#xD;
             medications could affect pain measures (exceptions will be therapies such as methadone&#xD;
             or buprenorphine used to treat opioid addiction). Only those who are stable on these&#xD;
             medications for at least 60 days will be included. All patient medications used for at&#xD;
             least the 60 days prior to participation will be recorded and controlled in&#xD;
             statistical analyses as needed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Systemic rheumatic disease (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus).&#xD;
             These rheumatologic conditions will be excluded due to their autoimmune&#xD;
             characteristic. . Cachexia (wasting syndrome) and severe frailty. This exclusion is in&#xD;
             place to protect against the stress of experimental pain testing&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of clinically significant surgery in the past year&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled hypertension (i.e. SBP/DBP of &gt;150/95) or cardiovascular or peripheral&#xD;
             arterial disease. These exclusions are in place primarily for safety reasons because&#xD;
             the cold pressor task represents a cardiovascular challenge. However, uncontrolled&#xD;
             hypertension can also affect pain perception, which is another reason for excluding&#xD;
             these individuals&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Poorly controlled diabetes (HbA1c &gt; 8%) for both safety reasons, and because diabetic&#xD;
             neuropathy could alter pain perception&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Neurological disease (e.g. Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serious psychiatric disorder requiring hospitalization within the past 12 months or&#xD;
             characterized by active suicidal ideation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any participant deemed to be actively suicidal upon study screening will be escorted&#xD;
             to the UAB emergency room and evaluated by the Psychiatry Service&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diminished cognitive function that would interfere with understanding of study&#xD;
             procedures. The Realm Health Literacy Test will be administered to ensure that&#xD;
             participants are free of cognitive impairment that would compromise study&#xD;
             participation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy. Inclusion/exclusion criteria will be verified using the screening tool in&#xD;
             combination with review of participants' medical records&#xD;
