      Collect blood from patients admitted for coronary angiography to tubes with heparin,&#xD;
      centrifuge and collect plasma. This will be frozen at -80C. Sent to the Lipotype laboratory,&#xD;
      Dresden, Germany, for the detection and quantification of compounds derived from oxidized LDL&#xD;
      cholesterol (cholesterol hemi-esters).&#xD;

      Plasma samples were obtained from a total of 427 individuals. Baseline characteristics are&#xD;
      outlined in Table 1. Control (n = 85) were taken from the population of the Coimbra and&#xD;
      Lisbon, Portugal, regions. They satisfied the criterion that they had never had any CVD- or&#xD;
      SLE-related health complaints. The CVD patients (n = 238) were divided into 6 groups. CVD1 (n&#xD;
      = 61) contains individuals who went to the hospital with chest pain but had no indicators for&#xD;
      stable angina pectoris, unstable angina pectoris or myocardial infarction. CVD2 (n = 82) are&#xD;
      patients with stable angina pectoris (SAP). CVD1 and CVD2 are defined according to the&#xD;
      ACCF/AHA/ACP/AATS/PCNA/SCAI/STS guidelines. CVD3 (n = 20) contains patients with unstable&#xD;
      angina pectoris, CVD4 (n = 34) are patients who suffered an acute myocardial infarction with&#xD;
      no ST-elevation in ECG, and CVD5 (n = 20) are patients who suffered acute myocardial&#xD;
      infarction with ST-elevation in ECG. CVD3, CVD4, and CVD5, together, may be classified as&#xD;
      patients with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). CVD1 through CVD5 groups were all obtained&#xD;
      from Hospital Santa Cruz, Carnaxide, Portugal. Acute ischemic stroke (IS) (n = 21) were&#xD;
      patients admitted at the emergency room of the Centro Hospitalar de Lisboa Ocidental, Lisbon,&#xD;
      Portugal, who suffered from acute ischemic stroke. The SLE cohort (n = 104) were patients&#xD;
      from Hospital Dr. Fernando Fonseca, Amadora, Portugal. The inclusion criteria were all&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with the pathology and above 18 years old. The exclusion criteria were the&#xD;
      existence of serious renal and hepatic pathologies, cancer or existence of infectious&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;

      Blood samples were drawn into tubes containing an anti-coagulant (heparin or EDTA)&#xD;
      immediately after admission into the hospital and signing of the informed consent. The&#xD;
      samples were kept at 4°C and processed within 24 h from collection. Plasma was obtained by&#xD;
      centrifugation of the blood at 500 g for 10 min at 4°C, frozen at -80°C and stored at this&#xD;
