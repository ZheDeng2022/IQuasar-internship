      This study will evaluate the effect of CBP-201 in adult patients with Chronic Rhinosinusitis&#xD;
      with Nasal Polyps (CRSwNP).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of CBP-201 on a background of mometasone furoate nasal spray (MFNS) in reducing&#xD;
      endoscopic nasal polyp score (NPS) and nasal congestion/obstruction score (NCS) severity in&#xD;
      eligible patients with CRSwNP whose disease remains inadequately controlled despite daily&#xD;
      treatment with intranasal corticosteroid (INCS) therapy in comparison to placebo. CBP-201 is&#xD;
      administered as a subcutaneous (SC) injection. The study is divided into a treatment period&#xD;
      of 24 weeks and a follow-up period of 8 weeks.&#xD;
