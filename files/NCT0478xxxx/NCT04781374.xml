  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this research study, investigators are testing neratinib in prostate cancer that has&#xD;
      spread and is no longer responding to hormonal therapies. This research study involves&#xD;
      testing tumors for evidence of increased HER2 signaling, and treating those who do have&#xD;
      increased HER2 signaling with a targeted therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include: screening for eligibility and study treatment&#xD;
      including evaluations and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The names of the study drug involved in this study is neratinib. It is expected that about&#xD;
      14 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a&#xD;
      specific disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration&#xD;
      (FDA) has not approved neratinib for this specific disease but it has been approved for other&#xD;
      uses.&#xD;

    <description>Progression-Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from registration to the earlier of progression by PCWG3 criteria or death due to any cause.&#xD;
PCWG3 progression is defined as when the treating physician feels the patient is &quot;no longer clinically benefitting&quot; (NLCB) from therapy. Generally, this is understood as radiographic or clinical/symptomatic progression (i.e. not PSA progression alone), but PCWG3 criteria allow treatment beyond radiographic progression when the treating physician feels that the patient is continuing to derive clinical benefit from therapy (compared to other available treatments or no treatment). Participants alive without disease progression are censored at date of last disease evaluation</description>

&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
