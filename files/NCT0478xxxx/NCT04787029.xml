  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the purpose of this study is to investigate whether prophylactic medical&#xD;
      compression therapy in breast cancer patients receiving docetaxel adjuvant chemotherapy could&#xD;
      reduce the incidence and severity of lymphedema in the upper limbs that received axillary&#xD;
      lymph node resection (sentinel lymph node biopsy or axillary lymph node dissection).&#xD;

    <description>Limb lymphedema volumes were measured using the electronic volumeter device (Perometer; Pero-System, Wuppertal, Germany), which is an optoelectronic instrument for measuring limb volume and circumferences.&#xD;
PCEV (%) = [(volume of affected limb - volume of unaffected limb) / volume of unaffected limb] × 100 Volume comparison between groups at the onset of lymphedema during the follow-up period (Enrollment (pre-docetaxcel), mid-docetaxcel(up to 20 weeks), Post-docetaxcel 1month, Post-docetaxcel 3month, Post-docetaxcel, 6month, Post-docetaxcel, 1year, Post-docetaxcel, 1.5year, Post-docetaxcel 2year)</description>

    <description>This study provides medical compression stockings from the start date of Docetaxel administration for patients who have undergone mastectomy and axillary lymphectomy for breast cancer, and who are planning to receive Docetaxel adjuvant chemotherapy. The intervention group wears medical compression stockings for upper limbs with a pressure level of 1 (15-21mmHg) during the day from the start of docetaxel administration to 3 months after the end of administration.&#xD;
Basic education of upper limb exercises (joint motion range enhancement exercises and upper limb muscle pumping exercises) is provided to both the intervention group and the control group.</description>

    <description>The control group proceeds as an observation, but interventions such as providing stockings in the event of lymphedema are performed.&#xD;
