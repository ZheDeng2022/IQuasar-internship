  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of masks has become an important part of life in outbreak conditions. In order to&#xD;
      prevent the spread of the outbreak, many people in society may have to wear masks for hours&#xD;
      during the day. As a mask type, the medical mask is frequently preferred in society. There&#xD;
      are limited studies on how the use of medical masks affects the person wearing the mask while&#xD;
      performing various activities that require different energy needs during the day. Therefore,&#xD;
      this study aims to investigate how the use of medical mask affects exercise capacity and leg&#xD;
      endurance with simple field tests.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Medical masks in use today are disposable and consist of three or four fine to very fine&#xD;
      fibers. Medical masks are divided into three groups as type I, type II, and type IIR&#xD;
      according to performance requirements. It is generally recommended for type I patients, type&#xD;
      II, and type IIR healthcare professionals. The fact that many people in society use medical&#xD;
      masks for hours in the current outbreak conditions and it is not known how long this&#xD;
      situation will last suggests that the effects of the medical mask should be investigated&#xD;
      further. This study was designed to investigate the effects use of a medical mask on exercise&#xD;
      capacity and lower extremity endurance in young people. In the analysis using the G * Power&#xD;
      3.1.9.7 program, the sample size was calculated as 79 when the power ratio was at least 85%&#xD;
      and the alpha error rate was 0.05. Participants included in the study will perform 3 field&#xD;
      tests. Tests will be performed in the form of 30 seconds sit-to-stand test, incremental&#xD;
      shuttle walk test (ISWT), and 6-minute walk test (6 MWT), respectively. Participants will&#xD;
      come to the working place for 2 days to be evaluated. In this process, they will perform&#xD;
      field tests one day with a medical mask and the other day without a mask. Whether the field&#xD;
      tests to be performed on the first day will be with or without a medical mask will be decided&#xD;
      through randomization. The tests to be made in the second visit will be carried out within 10&#xD;
      days with the time of the previous test, environmental conditions, and test sequence. The&#xD;
      mask to be used in tests is a type I medical mask recommended for general public health in&#xD;
      outbreak situations. The mask has three layers. During the study, the mask will be replaced&#xD;
      with a new one at the end of each test. Also, mask-wearing comfort at rest, during daily&#xD;
      living activities, and after ISWT will be evaluated with a 10-item scale. In the study,&#xD;
      attention will be paid to precautions such as the researcher's use of a face shield and the&#xD;
      protection of social distance in order to prevent the risk of contamination.&#xD;
