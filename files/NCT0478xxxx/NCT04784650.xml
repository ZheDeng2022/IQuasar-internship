    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus is one of the main causes of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and an increased&#xD;
      risk of foot complications is seen in patients suffering from both DM and CKD. CKD and DM&#xD;
      patients share a trilogy of risk factors that contribute to the development of foot ulcers.&#xD;
      This trilogy consists of peripheral arterial disease (PAD), neuropathy and an increased&#xD;
      susceptibility to infection with an impaired wound healing. Additionally, almost one quarter&#xD;
      of adults with CKD have to cope with depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our study is to determine the prevalence and types of foot problems in a&#xD;
      pre-dialysis population, consisting of both DM and non-DM patients. If possible, risk factors&#xD;
      will be determined. The detrimental effects of poor kidney function and foot problems on the&#xD;
      quality of life and the general health status will be analyzed. A higher prevalence of PAD,&#xD;
      peripheral neuropathy and DM are expected in patients with foot problems compared to those&#xD;
      without.&#xD;

      Plenty of research has been published regarding the prevalence of foot ulcers in a diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus (DM) population. Zhang et al. concluded that foot ulceration is prevalent in 6,3% of&#xD;
      DM patients worldwide. Moreover, diabetes mellitus is one of the main causes of chronic&#xD;
      kidney disease (CKD) and an increased risk of foot complications is seen in patients&#xD;
      suffering from both DM and CKD. Furthermore, dialysis treatment is also associated with a&#xD;
      higher probability of foot ulceration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to Ndip et al., CKD and DM patients share a trilogy of risk factors that contribute&#xD;
      to the development of foot ulcers. This trilogy consists of peripheral arterial disease&#xD;
      (PAD), neuropathy and an increased susceptibility to infection with an impaired wound&#xD;
      healing. Both diabetic and non-diabetic CKD patients have a high risk for peripheral&#xD;
      neuropathy, creating a decreased sensation in the feet. This makes them more vulnerable for&#xD;
      minor trauma, leading to the development of foot ulcers. These often precede more serious&#xD;
      foot complications like infections and amputations, which have a great impact on the&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality of the patient. They also cause a major financial load for the&#xD;
      healthcare system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, almost one quarter of adults with CKD have to cope with depression. This is&#xD;
      independently associated with a reduced quality of life in a pre-dialysis population. The&#xD;
      quality of life is also impaired by the presence of PAD, peripheral neuropathy and foot&#xD;
      problems. Unfortunately, patients can be so overwhelmed by their renal disease that they&#xD;
      avoid education and self-care, which can lead to even more complications and health costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In UZ Leuven, patients with a severe loss of kidney function (down to 25 percent or less of&#xD;
      the normal function) are taken up in the pre-dialysis program. In contrast to DM and dialysis&#xD;
      patients, there is a paucity of data about the prevalence of different foot problems in a&#xD;
      pre-dialysis population. Freeman et al. performed one of the few studies that also include&#xD;
      non-DM CKD patients. Hereby, a similar frequency of foot ulcers was found in CKD patients as&#xD;
      in DM patients. However, an important limitation of the study is the small sample group size,&#xD;
      so further research is needed. As CKD in stages 3 to 5 may affect approximately 10% of the&#xD;
      global population, it is important to learn more about the different foot complaints that&#xD;
      occur in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our study is to determine the prevalence and types of foot problems in a&#xD;
      pre-dialysis population, consisting of both DM and non-DM patients. If possible, risk factors&#xD;
      will be determined. The detrimental effects of poor kidney function and foot problems on the&#xD;
      quality of life and the general health status will be analyzed. A higher prevalence of PAD,&#xD;
      peripheral neuropathy and DM are expected in patients with foot problems compared to those&#xD;
      without.&#xD;
