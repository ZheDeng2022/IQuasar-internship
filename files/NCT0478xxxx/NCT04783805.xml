  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Conservative management of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs) seems safe and&#xD;
      justified in young women (&lt;30 years), but evidence is insufficient on whether it is also&#xD;
      advisable for older women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted to analyze spontaneous HSIL regression rates in women of&#xD;
      reproductive age and establish whether conservative HSIL management could be safely&#xD;
      recommended to women of childbearing potential, irrespective of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-center prospective observational study that will include consecutive women&#xD;
      of reproductive age, referred to a tertiary hospital due to HSIL between March 2021 and&#xD;
      December 2025, who prefer conservative management rather than immediate cervical conization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be followed-up regularly with colposcopy, cytology, human papillomavirus&#xD;
      (HPV) testing and biopsies. In case their lesions progress or HSIL persists after 24 months&#xD;
      of follow-up, conization will be indicated. Rates of spontaneous regression or resolution, as&#xD;
      well as progression rates, will be assessed. Furthermore, the association between potential&#xD;
      predictive factors and HSIL resolution will be analyzed.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In most developed countries, two main strategies are currently used for cervical cancer&#xD;
      prevention: primary prevention with human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination, and systematic&#xD;
      screening with periodic cytology or HPV testing. Nevertheless, a significant number of women&#xD;
      are still diagnosed with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL), with higher&#xD;
      prevalence rates among younger women (0.6% between ages 20 and 29; 0.2% between 40 and 49).&#xD;
      Since the average age at first pregnancy in Catalonia is 32.2 years, many patients have not&#xD;
      yet fulfilled their reproductive intentions when they are diagnosed with HSIL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most HSIL cases are treated surgically with cervical conization, although previous studies&#xD;
      have indicated that this may increase the incidence of preterm labor in future pregnancies.&#xD;
      Therefore, many women diagnosed with HSIL will undergo treatment that may affect their future&#xD;
      reproductive life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients diagnosed with HSIL, conservative management with periodic evaluations would be&#xD;
      an efficient alternative to surgery, with the expectation of spontaneous resolution. Recent&#xD;
      studies have shown that 40-88% of HSIL lesions can regress spontaneously within two years,&#xD;
      especially in women under 25. Furthermore, a meta-analysis of 36 studies involving 3160&#xD;
      patients concluded that active surveillance of patients diagnosed with cervical&#xD;
      intraepitelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 2, rather than immediate surgical treatment, is&#xD;
      justified, especially in young women (&lt;30 years). Recent clinical guidelines include active&#xD;
      surveillance as a valid option for management of HSIL in fertile women, with no age&#xD;
      restrictions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the biological behavior of CIN2 without surgical treatment has been described in&#xD;
      numerous studies, few included lesions classified as CIN3. Since the latest anatomical and&#xD;
      pathological classification of the World Health Organization does not make any distinction&#xD;
      between CIN2 and CIN3, classifying both as HSIL, treatment guidelines should be uniform for&#xD;
      all HSILs, without discriminating between CIN2 or CIN3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, although several studies have demonstrated the safety of conservative management&#xD;
      for HSIL in women younger than 25-30 years, there is insufficient information in women aged&#xD;
      30-40 years. Therefore, further evidence is still needed on the rate of spontaneous&#xD;
      regression of HSIL (both CIN2 and CIN3) and on the safety of active surveillance, so that&#xD;
      conservative management may be considered in all women who wish to become pregnant in the&#xD;
      future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal of this study will be to analyze whether spontaneous HSIL (CIN2 and CIN3)&#xD;
      regression rates in women of reproductive age are high enough to support conservative&#xD;
      management without age restrictions. We aim to describe the rates of spontaneous HSIL&#xD;
      regression, HSIL persistence and HSIL progression in women under conservative management.&#xD;
      Furthermore, we aim to describe predictive factors associated with HSIL regression rates. If&#xD;
      this study confirms the safety of conservative management of HSIL, it could be possible to&#xD;
      reduce the number of cervical conizations in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim This will be a prospective observational cohort study performed at a Lower Genital Tract&#xD;
      (LGT) unit of a tertiary hospital (Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain)&#xD;
      affiliated with a cytology-based cervical cancer screening program. In this center, all&#xD;
      colposcopic examinations are performed by two senior colposcopists, accredited by the Spanish&#xD;
      Association for Cervical Pathology and Colposcopy (AEPCC). Pathology samples are analyzed by&#xD;
      specialist technicians from the Pathology department of the same hospital and reviewed by&#xD;
      expert pathologists. HPV tests are performed for all patients in the same laboratory using&#xD;
      Genómica's Clart Human Papillomavirus 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients All women referred to our LGT unit with biopsy-confirmed histological diagnosis of&#xD;
      HSIL (CIN2 or CIN3) are assessed with colposcopy and counseled by expert gynecologists.&#xD;
      Patients considered suitable for conservative management (instead of immediate surgical&#xD;
      treatment with cervical conization) are routinely informed of the potential risks and&#xD;
      benefits of both cervical conization and active surveillance of HSIL. Then, a shared decision&#xD;
      is made for either surveillance or immediate conization. To be considered suitable for&#xD;
      conservative management, women must: be of reproductive age; have transformation zone type 1&#xD;
      or 2 (fully visible squamous-columnar union) at colposcopy, with a fully visible lesion and&#xD;
      no atypical glandular cells (AGC) at cytology; and commit to attend follow-up visits at&#xD;
      regular intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will start in March 2021 and will be concluded in December 2027. Consecutive women&#xD;
      of reproductive age referred to our center from March 2021 to December 2025 with a diagnosis&#xD;
      of HSIL that are considered suitable for conservative management and freely chose active&#xD;
      surveillance will be invited to participate in this study. Patients will be followed-up for a&#xD;
      minimum of 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility criteria include positive high-risk (hr) HPV cytology, reproductive age and a&#xD;
      wish to pursue pregnancy in the future. Women who are pregnant at diagnosis, immunosuppressed&#xD;
      or diagnosed with carcinoma in situ of the cervix or cervical cancer will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was approved by the institution's ethics committee. Written informed consent will&#xD;
      be obtained from all patients. All follow-up visits and clinical tests will be performed&#xD;
      according to standard patient care and no tests or visits will be conditioned to&#xD;
      participation in the study, nor will any additional treatment be given to patients enrolled.&#xD;
      Verbal informed consent to continue conservative treatment will be reviewed at each follow-up&#xD;
      visit. At any time during follow-up, patients can choose to have conization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visits will be performed every 4 months, including colposcopy and cytology at each&#xD;
      visit. Biopsies will not performed routinely, but on a case-by-case basis according to&#xD;
      changes observed in colposcopy. The follow-up interval will be extended to 6 months if&#xD;
      cytology and biopsies indicated low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) or atypical&#xD;
      squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) and this result is consistent with&#xD;
      colposcopy. HPV will be determined every 8 12 months. This follow-up protocol will be&#xD;
      continued until resolution of HSIL. Patients will be referred back to primary care when no&#xD;
      HSIL is detected by cytology, colposcopy or biopsies and if HPV is negative at two&#xD;
      consecutive visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conservative management will be discontinued and conization will be indicated if HSIL&#xD;
      persists after 24 months of follow-up, if the patient no longer meet criteria for&#xD;
      surveillance, or under the patient's request.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All information will be retrieved from electronic patient files. Demographic data, smoking&#xD;
      status, parity, use of contraceptives and colposcopy will be recorded. Information from&#xD;
      pathology reports of cytology, biopsies and conization specimens will be collected, and time&#xD;
      to HSIL resolution, regression or progression will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be classified into two groups according to the outcome of active surveillance:&#xD;
      spontaneous HSIL regression or conization (women who had cervical conization for any reason&#xD;
      during follow-up). Patients with spontaneous HSIL regression will be further classified into&#xD;
      3 subgroups: total resolution (no colposcopic lesion, normal pathology by biopsy and&#xD;
      cytology, and negative HPV for the HPV type initially detected); partial resolution&#xD;
      (regression of colposcopic lesion, negative cytology and biopsies, but persistence of the&#xD;
      initial hrHPV detected); and lesion regression (HSIL no longer detected, but persistent LSIL&#xD;
      in either cytology, histology or colposcopy). Patients who eventually have conization will be&#xD;
      further classified according to indication criteria: failure to meet criteria for&#xD;
      conservative management or persistence of HSIL after 24 months of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis Patient characteristics will be described according to whether their lesions&#xD;
      regress spontaneously or conization is indicated throughout the follow-up period. Numbers and&#xD;
      percentages will be provided for categorical variables, whereas means and standard deviations&#xD;
      will be used for quantitative variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The association between potential predictive variables and HSIL resolution will be analyzed&#xD;
      with chi-square tests (or Fisher's exact test when appropriate) for categorical variables and&#xD;
      t-tests for quantitative variables. Variables assessed will include: age and ethnicity,&#xD;
      smoking status, number of sexual partners within the previous 6 months, HPV type, alternative&#xD;
      therapies, HPV vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The characteristics of patients who have conization will be summarized, comparing patients&#xD;
      referred to surgery because they failed to meet surveillance criteria to those referred to&#xD;
      surgery due to persistence of HSIL at end of follow-up. The statistical analysis will be&#xD;
      performed with SPSS version 26.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Differences between groups&#xD;
      were considered statistically significant at p &lt; 0.05.&#xD;
