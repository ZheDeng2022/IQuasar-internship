  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postural alignment in the cervical and thoracic regions is affected by various risks such as&#xD;
      smartphone use in particular young adults. The small screen of smartphones causes ergonomic&#xD;
      risk for posture and musculoskeletal system. Previous studies found that neck, shoulder, and&#xD;
      upper back pain associated with the overuse of smartphones. Neck pain often arises from&#xD;
      unideal postures. Participants should be informed about these risks and encouraged to&#xD;
      exercise to be protective. Digital health apps' use is rising by the day and health apps&#xD;
      offer opportunities for both healthcare professionals and users.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this study aimed to develop an app including preventive exercise interventions to&#xD;
      keep postural alignment in cervical and thoracic spine regions employing an iterative,&#xD;
      user-centred design and to test the usability of the app and evaluate its effectiveness with&#xD;
      a pilot randomized controlled trial&#xD;

    <measure>Evaluation of musculoskeletal problems</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Musculoskeletal problems were assessed by Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire. The Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire queries yes/no for nine body regions so far, in the last 12 months, and in the last 7 days of evaluation, whether ache, pain, or discomfort.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>VAS</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at end of the 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Neck pain was assessed by Visual Analog Scale (VAS) before and after the 6 weeks exercise program. The participants were instructed to mark a point on a line between zero (no pain) and 10 cm (maximum pain).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Neck Pain and Disability Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at end of the 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Functional disability associated with neck pain was evaluated by the Neck Pain and Disability Scale (NPAD) questionnaire before and after the 6 weeks exercise program. The Neck Pain and Disability Scale consists of 20 items and each item was scored from 0 to 5, and the total score is the sum of the item scores [possible range 0 (no pain)-100 (maximal pain)].</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of exercise adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>At end of the 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The app automatically gathers total usage status (count of participated sessions, usage times) when participants login to the app to start an exercise program.&#xD;
Exercise adherence was measured with a ratio of total participated sessions compared with the target defined.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of app satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>At end of the 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Users were evaluated to rate their satisfaction with the intervention on a 5-point Likert scale after 6 weeks period.</description>

    <description>We conducted focus group meetings to discuss the content, features and design of the app.&#xD;
The focus group consisted of physiotherapists and young adults. The focus group members discussed the variety of topics in subgroups (login parameters, self-monitoring, exercises content, video or animation types, exercise diary, reminders, encouragement, method, etc).</description>

    <description>We conduct a think-aloud interview and evaluate the quantitative usability in the third phase.&#xD;
The quantitative usability was assessed by the System Usability Scale (SUS), and the adapted Usability, Satisfaction and Ease to Use (USE) Questionnaire.</description>

    <description>Participants received home exercise programs by a postural alignment exercise mobile app we developed.&#xD;
The postural alignment app included 3 main emerged themes were recorded as self-assessment, neck/shoulder, and upper back-specific exercise content, and motivational notifications.&#xD;
Participants can evaluate themselves in the application thanks to the self-assessment, receive motivational notifications during the day, and exercise reminders on the days determined by them. They can apply the exercise program with the formed exercise content videos.&#xD;
The exercise program consists of combined exercises that postural alignment plus exercises of neck spinal stabilization, stretching, and strengthening of neck/shoulders/upper back regions.&#xD;
Both group participants were requested to do the exercises from the app/brochure 3 times a week, for 6 weeks.</description>
