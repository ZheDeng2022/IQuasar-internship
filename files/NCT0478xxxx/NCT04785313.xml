  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common pathology causing significant morbidity and mortality. It&#xD;
      is usually secondary to migration through the inferior vena cava (IVC) of a formed thrombus&#xD;
      in the veins of the lower limbs or pelvis. The inferior vena cava filter (IVCF) is a medical&#xD;
      device whose purpose is to prevent thrombus migration from the veins of the legs and pelvis&#xD;
      to the pulmonary arteries, thus preventing the occurrence of Pulmonary embolism (PE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no data on the interactions of Retrievable inferior vena cava filters (IVCF) with&#xD;
      the inferior vena cava (intrafilter thrombi, insertion through the venous wall) although it&#xD;
      may modify the evolution after IVCF retrievable.&#xD;

      The main objective of this study is to determine whether the presence of intrafilter thrombi&#xD;
      identified by anatomopathology at the time of inferior vena cava filters (IVCF) retrievable&#xD;
      was associated with the occurrence of a venous thromboembolism event within 3 months&#xD;
      following removal.&#xD;

    <measure>Correlation between presence of intrafilter thrombi identified by anatomopathologist at the time of retrievable inferior vena cava filters (IVCF) and the occurrence of a venous thromboembolism event within 3 months following removal.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Presence of intrafilter thrombi is measure by anatomopathology analysis of the Inferior Vena Cava Filters (IVCF).&#xD;
Venous thromboembolism events are either deep venous thrombosis (DVT) of the lower limbs (diagnosed by Doppler ultrasonography of the lower limbs) or pulmonary embolism (PE) (diagnosed by chest angio-computed tomography).</description>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Correlation between a high tilt of the Inferior Vena Cava Filters (IVCF) and the occurrence of thromboembolic events within the 3 months following the removal of the Inferior Vena Cava Filters (IVCF)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Tilt was numerically calculated (from 1 to 20) using the Carestream picture archiving communication system (PACS®) for the majority of the patients treated since 2012 and using a protractor on radiological and light boxes films for patients treated 2010 and 2011 (not recorded on the PACS®).&#xD;
High Tilt is Tilt &gt; 15.</description>
