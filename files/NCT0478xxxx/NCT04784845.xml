  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bacteria living in the nose and throat are generally harmless, but in some circumstances&#xD;
      cause infections of the lungs (pneumonia) and brain (meningitis), which are among the&#xD;
      commonest causes of death worldwide in young children (especially newborns). Babies with&#xD;
      certain 'good' bacteria in the nose and throat are less likely to have infections by such&#xD;
      'bad' bacteria. Scientists have tried giving probiotics ('good' bacteria swallowed or sprayed&#xD;
      into the nose) to pregnant women, new mothers and babies. These studies show that many&#xD;
      probiotics are safe, but the amount of bacteria given is often unknown, and it is unclear if&#xD;
      they work. A more precise option is to use controlled inoculation, by inserting a specific&#xD;
      amount of particular 'good' bacteria into the nose under carefully controlled conditions. Our&#xD;
      team have previously shown that inoculation with Neisseria lactamica ('good' bacteria) safely&#xD;
      and reliably decreases Neisseria meningitidis ('bad' bacteria) in healthy adults' noses. N.&#xD;
      lactamica is a type of harmless bacteria found in over 40% of children aged 1-2 years, but is&#xD;
      uncommon in newborns and adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to inoculate 20 healthy pregnant women with N. lactamica nose drops, to find out if&#xD;
      it is transferred to their babies after birth. Newborns become rapidly covered (colonised)&#xD;
      with bacteria from their mothers, other people, and the environment, so this method mimics a&#xD;
      natural way that babies receive bacteria. We will take saliva and nose swabs one day, one&#xD;
      week and one month after birth, and will use microbiological and genetic methods to study how&#xD;
      the bacteria changes in babies compared with their mothers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We plan to perform nasal inoculation with N. lactamica (wild type strain Y92-1009) in healthy&#xD;
      pregnant women, to establish whether horizontal N. lactamica transfer to their neonates&#xD;
      occurs, and to characterise the impact on the developing neonatal upper respiratory tract&#xD;
      (URT) microbiome. If successful, this study will provide a novel model for inducing and&#xD;
      capturing a natural colonisation event in neonates. Unlike traditional controlled human&#xD;
      infection models, which capture inoculation-induced colonisation, this first-in-man model&#xD;
      would study person-to-person commensal transmission, allowing comparison of microbiome&#xD;
      changes and adaptive commensal microevolution in mother-infant pairs. We have already&#xD;
      conducted relevant Patient and Public Involvement research, in which all 12 pregnant women&#xD;
      interviewed reported approval for this proposed study, and 11 expressed that they would have&#xD;
      been interested in taking part in such a study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will approach healthy pregnant women in their second and third trimesters of pregnancy.&#xD;
      Eligibility screening and enrolment will take place at 34+0 to 36+6 weeks gestation, and 20&#xD;
      women (not already colonised with N. lactamica) will be inoculated nasally with 10^5 colony&#xD;
      forming units N. lactamica Y92-1009 at 36+0 to 37+6 weeks gestation. Samples will be obtained&#xD;
      from new mothers (nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal and saliva) and their neonates&#xD;
      (nasopharyngeal and saliva) at 1 day, 1 week and 1 month post-partum. If possible, and with&#xD;
      the volunteer's consent, we will collect an umbilical cord blood sample at delivery and an&#xD;
      infant venous blood sample at 1 month post-partum, for storage and use in future studies. Any&#xD;
      natural N. lactamica carriers identified at screening will not be inoculated, but will be&#xD;
      followed-up with their neonates for biological sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharyngeal swabs and saliva will be suspended in storage medium, aliquoted and stored at&#xD;
      -80°C. N. lactamica colonisation will be confirmed using selective agar, Gram stain,&#xD;
      microscopy, and analytical profile index testing (and matrix-assisted laser&#xD;
      desorption/ionization time-of-flight for inconclusive results). N. lactamica colonisation&#xD;
      density will be quantified, isolates will be stored at -80°C, and Y92-1009 strain identity&#xD;
      will be confirmed using targeted polymerase chain reaction (PCR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbiome analysis will be performed on thawed aliquots of paired mother-neonate samples, by&#xD;
      DNA extraction, 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) gene PCR, and amplicon sequencing. Poor&#xD;
      quality and chimeric sequence reads will be removed, and high quality reads will be trimmed,&#xD;
      aligned and clustered for taxonomic classification and statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paired maternal and neonatal isolates confirmed as N. lactamica Y92-1009 will be sequenced,&#xD;
      and resulting genomes will be mapped to a complete N. lactamica Y92-1009 closed reference&#xD;
      genome, to assess for evidence of distinct microevolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also compare paired microbiome profiles to identify candidate organisms that are&#xD;
      present in mothers and their infants. Paired mother-neonate sample aliquots will be thawed&#xD;
      and plated onto selective media, and isolates of candidate species will be identified using&#xD;
      Gram stain, microscopy, and other relevant microbiological tests. Resulting isolates will be&#xD;
      sequenced and analysed for evidence of strain sharing between mothers and their neonates,&#xD;
      suggesting horizontal transfer.&#xD;
