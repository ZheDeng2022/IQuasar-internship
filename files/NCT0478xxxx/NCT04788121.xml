  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Upper Gastrointestinal bleed is a common presentation in a medical emergency. Patients&#xD;
      generally present with hematemesis, melena or in severe cases hematochezia. Incidence and&#xD;
      etiology vary from region as well as the level of health care facility. In the US, UGI bleed&#xD;
      accountsfor about 300000 admissions per year (6). India has a huge burden of UGI bleed. A&#xD;
      study in India showed 4.6% of hospitaladmissions were due to UGI bleed (7). As per the&#xD;
      medical record of PGIMER, 2-3 patients of UGIbleed are admitted to the EMOPD every day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upper GI bleed is anatomically defined as any gastrointestinal bleed originating proximal to&#xD;
      ligamentof treitz (8). Causes of UGI bleed are generally divided into variceal and&#xD;
      non-variceal in origin. The common etiology of non-variceal bleed are Peptic Ulcer disease&#xD;
      (PUD), esophagitis, erosive Gastritis, vascular malformations, Mallory Weiss tear and GI&#xD;
      malignancies.Variceal hemorrhage is usually secondary to esophageal varices, but alsocan be&#xD;
      due to gastric varices and ectopic varices of the upper GI tract(9).Non-varicealcauses are&#xD;
      more common as compared to variceal bleed (10) and among this PUD is the most common (10).But&#xD;
      there is recent rising trend of variceal bleed secondary to chronic liver disease and portal&#xD;
      hypertension .As per a recently published institutional study, variceal bleed constituted&#xD;
      45.7% of UGI bleed (11). Morbidity and mortality associated with UGI bleed are significantly&#xD;
      high.Variceal bleed is becoming a major concern in tertiarycare centers and carries a higher&#xD;
      mortality as compared to non variceal bleed(12 ).Clinical severity of UGI bleed may vary from&#xD;
      being insignificant to fatal. Mortality from UGI bleed may vary from 2 to 5% where as it&#xD;
      around 10-30% in cases of re-bleed (12). Prompt UGI endoscopic procedure is diagnostic as&#xD;
      well as therapeutic which should be done ideally within first 24hrsalong with airway, volume&#xD;
      and blood resuscitative measures (13).High dose proton pump inhibitors(PPI) are used for&#xD;
      non-variceal bleed where as splanchnic vasoconstrictorsare used in variceal bleed along with&#xD;
      endoscopic procedure like injection of Epinephrine, Sclerosants, application of haemostatic&#xD;
      material like hemoclips/endoclips, over the scope clips, glue or tissue adhesive, haemostatic&#xD;
      powder/spray. Beside these endoscopic bipolar electro coagulation, heater probe coagulation,&#xD;
      argon plasma coagulator, laser photocoagulation can also be done as and when required. For&#xD;
      variceal bleed endoscopic variceal band ligation (EVL) is the main stay of therapy. However&#xD;
      routine use of antifibrinolytic agent hasn't been recommended in the guidelines for&#xD;
      management of acute UGI bleed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have shown that fibrinolysis may play an important role in GI bleeding dueto&#xD;
      premature breakdown of fibrin blood clots at the bleeding site (14). Studies have also shown&#xD;
      that many patients with acute UGI bleed have elevated levels of fibrin degradation products&#xD;
      (a surrogate marker for fibrinolysis) and that is associated with worse outcomes (14).&#xD;
      Fibrinolysisalso contributes to the risk of re-bleed.Literature review suggests that early&#xD;
      administration ofTranexamic acid (TXA) reduces mortality due to bleeding in trauma patients&#xD;
      (15) and effective in controlling bleeding in menorrhagia (16). Our own institutional study&#xD;
      showed that TXA is effective as a bridging therapy in controlling bleeding from haemoptysis&#xD;
      before definitive therapeutic intervention done (1). A systematic COCHRANE review of TXA in&#xD;
      UGI bleed identified 7 trials (3). These trials showed statistically significant reduction in&#xD;
      mortality and reduced need ofsurgical interventions in patients receiving TXA. However the&#xD;
      trials had many fallacieslike small sample size, number of biases. The NICE guideline doesn't&#xD;
      include TXA inthe management of GI bleed (4). So far studies on use of TXA in UGI bleed&#xD;
      haven't been able to either recommend or refute the use of TXA in UGI bleed (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is also lack of study form India and the Southeast Asia regarding the efficacy of TXA&#xD;
      in UGI bleed. TXA, an anti-fibrinolytic agent, inhibits fibrinolysis by displacing&#xD;
      plasminogen from fibrin. So, TXA may have role in bleeding control and preventing re-bleed in&#xD;
      acute UGI bleed by stabilization of the clot formation. This study will evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      of early administration of TXA in acute onset UGIbleed, in term of bleeding control,&#xD;
      preventing re-bleeding and mortality.&#xD;
