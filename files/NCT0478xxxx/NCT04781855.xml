      This phase I/Ib trial evaluates the best dose and side effects of ipilimumab in combination&#xD;
      with either ibrutinib alone or with ibrutinib and nivolumab in treating patients with chronic&#xD;
      lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and Richter transformation (RT). Immunotherapy with monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies, such as ipilimumab and nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the&#xD;
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Ibrutinib may&#xD;
      stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;
      Giving ipilimumab with either ibrutinib alone or with ibrutinib and nivolumab may help&#xD;
      control CLL and RT.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of&#xD;
      ipilimumab in combination with ibrutinib in patients with CLL/small lymphocytic lymphoma&#xD;
      (SLL)/RT. (Part A) II. To determine the MTD and DLT of ipilimumab in combination with&#xD;
      nivolumab and ibrutinib in patients with CLL/SLL/RT. (Part B)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the efficacy (response rate, defined as complete response [CR] + complete&#xD;
      response with incomplete marrow recovery [CRi] + partial response [PR]) of the combination&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the progression-free survival and overall survival of the combination&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To study immunological and molecular changes in peripheral blood, lymph node, and bone&#xD;
      marrow in response to the combination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of ipilimumab followed by a dose-expansion study.&#xD;
      Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 parts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART A: Patients receive ipilimumab intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on day 1. Treatment&#xD;
      repeats every 3 weeks for up to 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Beginning day 1 of cycle 1, patients also receive ibrutinib orally&#xD;
      (PO) once daily (QD) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients&#xD;
      who complete 4 doses of ipilimumab and are deriving benefit from it, without severe&#xD;
      toxicities, may continue to receive ipilimumab every 12 weeks for up to a total of 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART B: Patients receive ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes and nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on&#xD;
      day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 4 cycles in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning day 7 of cycle 1, patients also receive&#xD;
      ibrutinib PO QD in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who&#xD;
      complete 4 doses of ipilimumab and nivolumab, and are deriving benefit from it, without&#xD;
      severe toxicities, may continue to receive ipilimumab every 12 weeks and nivolumab every 4&#xD;
      weeks for up to a total of 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, and then every 3&#xD;
      months thereafter.&#xD;

             with the interpretation of study results and/or would make the patient inappropriate&#xD;
