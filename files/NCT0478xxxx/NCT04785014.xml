      ABSTRACT Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of ultrasonography&#xD;
      (USG)-guided Baker's cyst (BC) aspiration in the treatment of BC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A total of 40 patients presented to our polyclinic with the complaints of swelling at&#xD;
      the back of the knee. The 40 patients were randomly divided into two groups: (I) aspiration&#xD;
      group (n=20) and (II) control group (n=20). In the aspiration group, BC content was aspirated&#xD;
      percutaneously under USG guidance, whereas no aspiration was performed in the control group.&#xD;
      Additionally, the participants in both groups were trained on how to perform exercises and&#xD;
      were also recommended to practice cold treatment for 15 min both in the morning and evening&#xD;
      for 2 weeks. All the patients were followed up with USG at the first and third months, VAS,&#xD;
      WOMAC, NHP , Lysholm and Cincinnati. The success of the treatment was demonstrated by the&#xD;
      decrease in the width, length and area of the BCs and Lysholm, Cincinnati ,VAS, WOMAC and NHP&#xD;
      scores.&#xD;

      Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of ultrasonography&#xD;
      (USG)-guided Baker's cyst (BC) aspiration in the treatment of BC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This prospective study was conducted at Erzurum Atatürk University Medical Faculty&#xD;
      Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Department between January 2016 and June 2017 for a&#xD;
      total period of 18 months. A total of 40 patients (11 males, 29 females) aged between 33-71&#xD;
      (mean age, 55.9 ± 9.6) years presented to our polyclinic with the complaints of swelling at&#xD;
      the back of the knee. All the patients signed an informed consent form and the study was&#xD;
      approved by the local ethics committee. (ERZURUM ATATUK UNIVERSITY MEDICAL FACULTY CLINICAL&#xD;
      RESEARCH ETHICS COMMITTEE Date:03.12.2015 Meeting Number:8 Decision Number:24) Patients with&#xD;
      a history of malignancy, coagulation disorder, and a neurological deficit and those receiving&#xD;
      anticoagulant therapy were excluded from the study. The sample size was determined with a 95%&#xD;
      confidence interval according to https://www.macorr.com/sample-size-calculator.htm website.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the procedure, all the patients were evaluated with grey-scale USG using an Esaote&#xD;
      MyLab 60 USG device with a linear probe of 7.5 MHz. On USG examination, the area of&#xD;
      transverse diameter(width-parallel to the knee joint), longitudinal diameter&#xD;
      (length-perpendicular to the knee joint), and the USG area( from the widest place viewed) of&#xD;
      BCs were calculated and recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical complaints of the patients, long-term complaints, and the history of medical,&#xD;
      interventional, and surgical treatments were reviewed for each patient. Patients were also&#xD;
      investigated for acute local or systemic infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The severity of clinical complaints was assessed using VAS, WOMAC knee osteoarthritis index,&#xD;
      Lysholm knee scoring scale, Cincinnati knee rating system, and NHP. Patients with BC who had&#xD;
      no contraindications for treatment and completed the WOMAC Knee osteoarthritis index, Lysholm&#xD;
      knee scoring scale, Cincinnati knee rating system, VAS, and NHP and signed the patient&#xD;
      consent form were included in the study. Patients were randomly divided into two groups by&#xD;
      consecutive alternate allocation according to the time of admittance: (I) aspiration group&#xD;
      (n=20) included the patients aspirated and (II) control group (n=20) included those who did&#xD;
      not aspirated. In the aspirated group, the popliteal fossa areas were sterilized and BC&#xD;
      content was aspirated from the popliteal fossa percutaneously under USG guidance with a&#xD;
      21-gauge needle (Figure 1). If the BC was septal, aspiration was performed from several&#xD;
      different levels of the cyst so that the cyst content could be completely emptied. In&#xD;
      contrast, no aspiration was performed in the control group. Additionally, the participants in&#xD;
      both groups were trained on how to perform exercises and were also recommended to practice&#xD;
      cold treatment for 15 min both in the morning and evening for 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the aspiration, the patients were told how to exercise and practice cold treatment in&#xD;
      the morning and evening for 2 weeks. Patients were discharged after a 30-min observation&#xD;
      period following the procedure. Patients were allowed to apply bandages for 2 days after the&#xD;
      procedure and were followed pre- and post-procedurally at the first and third months of&#xD;
      treatment with WOMAC Knee osteoarthritis index, Lysholm knee scoring scale, Cincinnati knee&#xD;
      rating system, VAS, and NHP and with USG. The appearance of BC at month 3 was examined on&#xD;
      grey-scale USG and the length, width, and area of the cyst were recalculated. During the&#xD;
      3-month follow-up period, no additional treatment was performed in any patient. The success&#xD;
      of the procedure was defined as reduction in BC width, length and area in sonographic&#xD;
      measurements and decrease in the Lysholm knee scoring scale, Cincinnati knee rating system,&#xD;
      VAS, WOMAC knee osteoarthritis index, and NHP scores.&#xD;
