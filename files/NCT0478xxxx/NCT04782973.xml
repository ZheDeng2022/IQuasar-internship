  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AMAZE™ is a disease management platform (DMP) designed to educate patients about heart&#xD;
      failure, help engage them in healthy behaviors and assist them in taking their medications as&#xD;
      prescribed. This study will assess whether the AMAZE™ smartphone-based application (&quot;app&quot;)&#xD;
      can help heart failure patients take better care of themselves after discharge from an&#xD;
      inpatient heart failure admission at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to demonstrate feasibility and perceived value of the AMAZE™&#xD;
      platform in clinical practice. The study will also explore whether the use of the AMAZE™&#xD;
      platform for 60 days post-discharge leads to a reduction in hospital readmission, emergency&#xD;
      department, urgent care and unexpected ambulatory care visits. The impact of the AMAZE™&#xD;
      platform on participant reported quality of life outcomes and perception of overall medical&#xD;
      care will also be examined.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) management and readmissions remain at the top of the list of complex&#xD;
      topics in cardiovascular medicine in the United States. Current system-wide programs to curb&#xD;
      HF-related hospital readmissions have shown inconsistent results. However, outpatient&#xD;
      transitional care supportive programs have been linked to improved HF-related outcomes,&#xD;
      including reduced hospital readmissions, in small studies. Small studies also indicate that&#xD;
      remote transfer of non-invasive data through telemonitoring (e.g., blood pressure and weight)&#xD;
      and structured telephone support may reduce hospital readmissions in a cost-effective manner.&#xD;
      The present pandemic has placed significant strains on the link between clinicians and&#xD;
      patients highlighting the need for rapid innovation for virtual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study involves the AMAZE™ DMP, developed by AstraZeneca, to provide a unified experience&#xD;
      for the management of HF patients throughout their patient care journey. The platform will&#xD;
      integrate multiple systems, including a smartphone-based application where patients can enter&#xD;
      daily mood, symptoms, weight measures, and vital signs such as blood pressure (BP) and&#xD;
      medication adherence. This input will feed directly to a clinician facing dashboard embedded&#xD;
      within the electronic medical record that will allow the clinical care team to access&#xD;
      real-time views of patients' states both in and out of clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be identified via an automated electronic medical record (EMR)-based,&#xD;
      computer-based algorithm and eligibility will be manually verified. Participants will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the study following an inpatient HF admission at Massachusetts General Hospital&#xD;
      (MGH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical providers and study staff will be able to view and monitor the subjects' AMAZE™&#xD;
      smartphone application entries within the electronic medical record via the AMAZE™ provider&#xD;
      dashboard. The AMAZE™ secure messaging function will be used for study and clinical&#xD;
      communications between the patient, study staff and clinical care team to facilitate&#xD;
      outpatient HF management. The AMAZE™ smartphone application (app) will indirectly assess the&#xD;
      patient's quality of life (Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire - KCCQ), as well as&#xD;
      patient satisfaction with the app (mHealth App Usability Questionnaire - MAUQ). For&#xD;
      clinicians, the MAUQ will measure provider satisfaction with the AMAZE™ dashboard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline demographics and study outcomes will be assessed via direct patient survey by study&#xD;
      staff at pre-specified time points (enrollment, 30-days post enrollment, 60-days post&#xD;
      enrollment). Outcomes will include medication changes, hospitalizations, emergency department&#xD;
      presentations, urgent care visits, primary care or cardiology office visits and cardiac&#xD;
      rehabilitation enrollment. Medical history, including labs, procedures, and diagnoses will be&#xD;
      collected from the electronic medical record and recorded in REDCap. The AMAZE™ app will&#xD;
      track medication adherence, daily symptom(s) log, blood pressure, weight, heart rate and&#xD;
      activity when entered by participants into a daily log. Participants will be asked and&#xD;
      encouraged to enter information into the smartphone-based app daily by study staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of the present proposal will be to generate evidence on the feasibility and&#xD;
      perceived value of the AMAZE™ platform implemented in clinical practice. The outcomes will be&#xD;
      measured using conversion rate (study enrollment rate among total number of eligible&#xD;
      patients) and utilization rate (percentage of days participants engaged with the AMAZE™ app&#xD;
      during the 60-day study period). This study is a first necessary step before testing efficacy&#xD;
      in a large multi-center study.&#xD;
