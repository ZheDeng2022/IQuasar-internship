  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  Hypoparathyroidism is the most common complication after a total thyroidectomy surgery.&#xD;
           It becomes permanent after 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Untreated permanent hypoparathyroidism is a source of numerous complications in general&#xD;
           and therefore requires lifelong replacement therapy resulting in a significant&#xD;
           deterioration in quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The intraoperative use of indocyanine green (ICG) angiography has recently been&#xD;
           described as a reliable means of detecting parathyroidism and predicting the risk of&#xD;
           postoperative hypoparathyroidism.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This use could prove to be a way to preserve parathyroid in vivo and thus reduce&#xD;
           post-operative hypoparathyroidism rates.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypoparathyroidism is the most common complication after a total thyroidectomy surgery. It is&#xD;
      most often transient but can sometimes be permanent when it persists for more than 6 months&#xD;
      after surgery. The rates are variable, of the order of 32% for transient hypoparathyroidism&#xD;
      and 1% for definitive hypoparathyroidism. Untreated permanent hypoparathyroidism is the&#xD;
      source of many complications in general and therefore requires lifelong replacement therapy.&#xD;
      The result is a significant deterioration in quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanisms responsible for hypoparathyroidism during thyroidectomy are direct damage to&#xD;
      the parathyroid glands, involuntary excision of these glands, and devascularization of these&#xD;
      glands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The detection of parathyroid glands and the prevention of hypoparathyroidism after&#xD;
      thyroidectomy therefore represents a major challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intraoperative use of indocyanine green angiography has recently been described as a&#xD;
      reliable means of detecting parathyroid and predicting the risk of postoperative&#xD;
      hypoparathyroidism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, prior studies and intraoperative observations suggest that indocyanine green&#xD;
      angiography during thyroid surgery may be a means of preserving parathyroid in vivo and thus&#xD;
      reducing post-operative hypoparathyroidism rates.&#xD;
