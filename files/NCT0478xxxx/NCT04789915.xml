      Antipsychotics affects the brain's dopamine system, and the drugs reduce delusions,&#xD;
      hallucinations, and disorganized thinking, which are cardinal symptoms of psychotic&#xD;
      disorders. However, negative symptoms e.g. anhedonia, avolition, and social withdrawal, as&#xD;
      well as cognitive deficits, are not sufficiently treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Memantine is used to treat Alzheimer's disease and affects the brain's glutamate system.&#xD;
      AMEND is a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial (RCT) testing&#xD;
      effects of add-on memantine to initial antipsychotic treatment in never-treated patients with&#xD;
      first-episode psychosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim is to reduce negative symptoms. Secondary outcomes are cognition, psychotic&#xD;
      symptoms, side effects. Glutamate levels in the brain will be measured before and after 12&#xD;
      weeks using an ultra-high field strength (7 Tesla) magnetic resonance scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AMEND will apply rational drug repurposing to optimize treatment of patients experiencing&#xD;
      their first psychotic episode.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND Scientific basis/Rationale Antipsychotic medication is efficacious in treating&#xD;
      positive psychotic symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thinking,&#xD;
      which are cardinal symptoms of schizophrenia spectrum disorders. However, antipsychotic&#xD;
      treatment does not ameliorate the accompanying negative symptoms (e.g. anhedonia, avolition,&#xD;
      and social withdrawal), and cognitive deficits, which are highly disabling and predictive of&#xD;
      patients' long-term prognosis. Importantly, shortening the interval between onset of&#xD;
      psychosis and initiation of an efficient intervention lead to better long-term outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathophysiology of psychosis is complex and involves multiple neurotransmitters, e.g.&#xD;
      serotoninergic-, GABAergic, and glutamatergic systems, but modulation (particularly&#xD;
      antagonism) of striatal dopamine D2 receptors (D2R) remain the key common denominator of all&#xD;
      licensed antipsychotics. Nevertheless, around one third of patients with psychosis display&#xD;
      inadequate response to antidopaminergic treatment, and persistent negative symptoms is a&#xD;
      critical predictor for future treatment resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glutamate hypothesis of psychosis Mounting evidence from post-mortem-, brain imaging-,&#xD;
      genetic-, and pharmacologic challenge studies indicate glutamatergic dysregulation,&#xD;
      specifically of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), as part of the pathophysiology of&#xD;
      psychosis and schizophrenia. Through excitotoxicity, glutamate dysregulation may underlie&#xD;
      structural degeneration, e.g. in hippocampus, which is a key finding in schizophrenia&#xD;
      spectrum patients. Nevertheless, cross-sectional 3T MRS glutamate levels between&#xD;
      first-episode patients and HC have shown equivocal results, e.g. likely reflecting&#xD;
      differences in glutamate levels across brain regions and in variable previous antipsychotic&#xD;
      exposure of included patients. Using 3T MRS, investigator recently reported increased&#xD;
      thalamic glutamate levels in antipsychotic-naïve patients with first-episode psychosis&#xD;
      compared to HC. Importantly, high thalamic levels predicted poor treatment response. Other&#xD;
      studies have also associated glutamate levels with outcome. Investigator have shown that&#xD;
      aberrations in the thalamic glutamate levels are heritable, related to psychosis, and extend&#xD;
      to individuals at ultra-high risk for psychosis (UHR). Investigator have found that thalamic&#xD;
      and ACC levels of glutamate are associated with symptomology and cognition, specifically&#xD;
      spatial working memory, set-shifting, and attention both in UHR and first episode psychosis.&#xD;
      Cutting-edge 7T MRS can non-invasively determine brain metabolite levels of e.g.&#xD;
      γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), N-acetylaspartate, N-acetylaspartyl, and importantly, 7T allows&#xD;
      to discriminate glutamate concentrations from glutathione and glutamine. Moreover, multiple&#xD;
      voxels/brain regions can be investigated with 7T. In the context of glutamate and psychosis,&#xD;
      the thalamus, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), hippocampus, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex&#xD;
      (DLPFC), and basal ganglia are of particular interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding brain structure, application of structural 7T sequences allows for increased&#xD;
      sensitivity to quantify neurodegeneration e.g. hippocampal subfield segmentation. Finally,&#xD;
      high resolution quantification of tissue parameters such as iron deposition using&#xD;
      quantitative susceptibility mapping allow characterization of subtle changes in the&#xD;
      'dopaminergic regions' of the basal ganglia, including striatum, pallidum, and substantia&#xD;
      nigra.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glutamate antagonist treatment Against this background, modulation of glutamatergic NMDAR has&#xD;
      been investigated as a potential treatment target in patients with psychosis and&#xD;
      schizophrenia. Memantine is a non-competitive NMDAR antagonist used for treatment of&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease. Two recent meta-analyses and one systematic review have concluded that&#xD;
      adjunctive memantine to antipsychotics is safe and significantly improves negative symptoms&#xD;
      in chronic medicated patients with schizophrenia. One of the meta-analyses also indicated a&#xD;
      potential effect on global levels of cognition. Memantine has been theorized to ameliorate&#xD;
      progression of negative symptoms by counteracting excitotoxicity correlated to high glutamate&#xD;
      levels in early stages of psychosis, but this has not been investigated in initially&#xD;
      antipsychotic-naïve patients. Finally, the intriguing fact that pharmacologically similar&#xD;
      antagonists of NMDARs (e.g. memantine and ketamine) exert almost paradoxical effects in&#xD;
      humans highlights the importance of understanding the pathophysiology of NMDAR modulation in&#xD;
      psychosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study medication Amisulpride All patients will be treated with amisulpride, as the standard&#xD;
      of care treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tablet amisulpride (100-800 mg/day) is a second-generation antipsychotic and a first-line,&#xD;
      generic drug against psychosis and schizophrenia in Denmark. Amisulpride primarily binds to&#xD;
      D2 and D3 receptors, but also has affinity for serotonin 5-HT7 receptors. In AMEND,&#xD;
      amisulpride is chosen because it is the most selective licensed antidopaminergic compound to&#xD;
      treat psychosis. Side effects include sedation, weight gain, hyperprolactinemia, and&#xD;
      extrapyramidal symptoms. Investigator have previously used amisulpride in a similar cohort of&#xD;
      antipsychotic-naïve patients and have gained extensive insights regarding its clinical&#xD;
      effects and relation to striatal dopamine receptor activity, reward system, brain structure,&#xD;
      weight gain, and sexual side effects. Of note, amisulpride has been approved for treatment of&#xD;
      negative symptoms in schizophrenia, however, in investigators previous cohort negative&#xD;
      symptoms did not improve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Memantine Tablet memantine (10-20 mg/day) is an generic drug approved for treatment of&#xD;
      Alzheimer's Disease(AD) showing benefits on the main domains of AD i.e. cognition, function,&#xD;
      behavior, and clinical global change. Memantine acts through uncompetitive, open-channel&#xD;
      NMDAR antagonism, and has minimal activity for GABAergic, dopaminergic, adrenergic,&#xD;
      histaminergic, and glycinergic receptors. There are no known interactions between memantine&#xD;
      and antipsychotics. Side effects include fatigue, dizziness, constipation, anxiety, headache,&#xD;
      diarrhoea, and nausea. In previous memantine add-on RCTs in schizophrenia patients, the&#xD;
      reported side effects did not differ from placebo. Memantine has no abuse potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placebo Placebo tablets will be coated to match memantine 10 or 20 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population Antipsychotic-naïve, first-episode schizophrenia spectrum patients with&#xD;
      first-episode psychosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited from psychiatric hospitals and outpatients psychiatric centers in&#xD;
      the capital region (Copenhagen area), where doctors or nursing staff will inform relevant&#xD;
      patients about the project and contact the doctor or nurse from the AMEND team, if the&#xD;
      patients accept and might fulfil the inclusion criteria. A diagnostic interview, Present&#xD;
      State Examination(PSE), will be performed before inclusion to assess if the patients fulfil&#xD;
      the inclusion criteria. In addition, to fulfilling the diagnostic criteria, it should be&#xD;
      medically assessed that the patient would benefit from antipsychotic treatment. Furthermore,&#xD;
      somatic and neurological examination, as well as screening of pregnancy and substance abuse,&#xD;
      will be performed before inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of study/ outstanding research questions to be answered in our study? Summary of concept&#xD;
      By rational combination of two licensed, off-patent drugs, amisulpride and memantine, AMEND&#xD;
      aims to optimize treatment of psychosis alongside with unravelling the signature of memantine&#xD;
      response. If successful, AMEND will provide pivotal neurobiological evidence for future&#xD;
      stratification of patients with first-episode psychosis before initial antipsychotic&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigator hypothesize that add-on of memantine to amisulpride:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Will be superior to reduce negative symptoms and that this effect will correlate with&#xD;
           reduced glutamate levels in thalamus after 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Will exert the most pronounced effect in patients, who display higher baseline thalamic&#xD;
           glutamate levels than HC, and this subgroup of patients will also experience better&#xD;
           total symptom control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Will improve domains of cognition, and specifically that effects on working memory,&#xD;
           set-shifting, and attention will be predicted by initial glutamate levels in thalamus&#xD;
           and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary and secondary endpoints Primary Endpoints Primary endpoint will be reduction in&#xD;
      negative symptoms as measured with Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) negative&#xD;
      symptoms after 12 weeks of treatment [PANSS negative baseline - PANSS negative at week 12].&#xD;
      Assessments will be supplemented by Brief Negative Symptom Scale (BNSS) scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints Secondary endpoints include changes in cognition (in particular working&#xD;
      memory, set-shifting, and attention), PANSS positive and total other clinical measures, level&#xD;
      of functioning, side effects, and glutamate levels in five a priori selected regions:&#xD;
      thalamus, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), hippocampus, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex&#xD;
      (DLPFC), and basal ganglia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory endpoints include associations between clinical data, quality of life, brain&#xD;
      metabolites in other regions, e.g. ACC, and structural measures (e.g. hippocampus subfields),&#xD;
      and basal ganglia quantification. Interactions between baseline brain metabolite levels and&#xD;
      brain structure in patients and HC will also be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods Study design This investigator-initiated, double blinded randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial, will establish a cohort of 46 antipsychotic- naïve first episode psychosis&#xD;
      patients aged 18-45. Patients will be recruited from psychiatric out- and inpatient clinics&#xD;
      in the Capital Region of Copenhagen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be allocated to 12 weeks treatment with [amisulpride plus memantine] OR&#xD;
      [amisulpride plus placebo]. Randomisation will be stratified by PANSS negative sub score&#xD;
      categorizing patients in a &quot;Low PANSS baseline&lt;20&quot; and &quot;High PANSS baseline&gt;=20&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomisation will use permuted blocs in sizes of 4,6 and 8, to ensure an even&#xD;
      distribution among the two groups since the number of patients in the two groups will not be&#xD;
      restricted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pharmacy (Region Hovedstadens apotek) will manage the randomisation. Twenty healthy&#xD;
      controls matched on age, gender and parental socio-economic status will be recruited by&#xD;
      advertisement and undergo baseline- and 12-week examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial design Double blinded randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study phase Phase I, known medicine (memantine) tested for new indication (psychosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timeline Estimated study duration To increase power of secondary analyses, enrolment will&#xD;
      continue until 18 participants in each arm have completed examinations. Moreover, AMEND will&#xD;
      be extended to 12 weeks based on the median trial duration in the meta-analysis of add-on&#xD;
      memantine (12 weeks (mean 11.5 weeks)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on our center's 20 years of experience with recruitment and treatment of&#xD;
      antipsychotic-naïve patents, we expect an inclusion rate of 2 patients per month and an&#xD;
      attrition rate of 25%. Thus, recruitment of 46 patients will take 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will take place from 1st of May 2021 until 31st December 2024.&#xD;
