      The purpose of the study is to observe the effect of PD-1 Antibody（Tislelizumab） Combined&#xD;

      Cholangiocarcinoma After Curative Resection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cholangiocarcinoma has a low incidence, accounting for only 3% of gastrointestinal&#xD;
      malignancies worldwide, but with an increasing trend in recent years.Cholangiocarcinoma is&#xD;
      extremely malignant, and the 5-year survival rate for patients who cannot undergo curative&#xD;
      resection at advanced stages is less than 10%. Surgical resection represents the only&#xD;
      curative opportunity for biliary tract cancer, but only 1 5% - 20% of patients can undergo&#xD;
      surgical resection; however, even patients who undergo curative surgical resection have a&#xD;
      high rate of postoperative metastasis recurrence, and effective treatment strategies are&#xD;
      lacking after metastasis recurrence.The median postoperative survival time is only 18-30&#xD;
      months and the 5-year survival rate is also only 20-35%.Among them, patients with high-risk&#xD;
      postoperative recurrence who are resected but have positive lymph nodes or margins have&#xD;
      further reduced survival, and no targeted effective postoperative adjuvant therapy is&#xD;
      available, becoming another important reason that hampers the long-term survival of surgical&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For unresectable or advanced cholangiocarcinoma, GEMOX, a two drug combination regimen of&#xD;
      gemcitabine plus cisplatin, can be used as a first-line chemotherapy regimen, but the&#xD;
      first-line regimen of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy is currently not uniformly&#xD;
      recommended.Previous adjuvant chemotherapy for cholangiocarcinoma was mostly based on&#xD;
      clinical experience from different medical centers and borrowed in view of gemcitabine - and&#xD;
      platinum based advanced regimens, but the conclusions based on retrospective studies varied&#xD;
      greatly among different centers and the recommendation was limited.Whereas there are fewer&#xD;
      prospective studies aiming to target postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy for&#xD;
      cholangiocarcinoma.The 2017 Prodige prospective randomized controlled study evaluated the&#xD;
      efficacy of GEMOX in advanced cholangiocarcinoma in 196 patients treated with postoperative&#xD;
      adjuvant chemotherapy and showed that although there was a trend toward benefit in RFs, it&#xD;
      was not statistically significant overall and does not support the use of the GEMOX regimen&#xD;
      in advanced cholangiocarcinoma in the postoperative adjuvant setting.While another 2018 bcat&#xD;
      prospective study negated the clinical benefit of gemcitabine monotherapy in postoperative&#xD;
      adjuvant chemotherapy for cholangiocarcinoma.In contrast, the 2017 Bilcap study was the only&#xD;
      one to yield positive results in postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy for&#xD;
      cholangiocarcinoma.The study compared the clinical value of capecitabine with clinical&#xD;
      observation in postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy for cholangiocarcinoma, the primary&#xD;
      endpoint was OS, the secondary endpoints included OS, recurrence free survival (RFs), etc.&#xD;
      adjuvant capecitabine can extend the OS of postoperative cholangiocarcinoma from 36 to 51&#xD;
      months, and in terms of safety, the differences in toxicity between the capecitabine&#xD;
      combination control groups were not significant and most of themNumber patients could&#xD;
      tolerate.Therefore, the ASCO guidelines also recommend adjuvant chemotherapy with&#xD;
      capecitabine in patients with cholangiocarcinoma after surgery and recommend it as a control&#xD;
      for subsequent clinical studies in cholangiocarcinoma.However, whether capecitabine&#xD;
      monotherapy can play a role in preventing recurrence in patients with high-risk disease who&#xD;
      have undergone surgery with positive lymph nodes or resection margins remains to be confirmed&#xD;
      by further studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cholangiocarcinoma is accompanied by a dysregulation and remodelling of the local immune&#xD;
      microenvironment, and therefore the catalysed tumour immunotherapy has been a long-standing&#xD;
      hotspot in the field of cancer therapy, in which T-cell-based tumour immunotherapy is in its&#xD;
      core position. 1 cancer immunotherapy is fully used and mobilising killer T cells from the&#xD;
      tumour bearing patient. 2Cells, to carry out the killing effect on the tumor, it may be the&#xD;
      most effective and the safest way to treat the tumor.At the same time, tumor escape is a&#xD;
      formidable obstacle facing tumor immunotherapy, in which tumor cells exploit their own&#xD;
      suppressive effects on the immune system to promote deranged tumor growth.There is an&#xD;
      extremely complex relationship between the immune escape mechanism of tumors and the host&#xD;
      immune response to tumors.Tumor immunotherapy tumor specific killer T cells in the early&#xD;
      stage are biologically active, but lose the function of killing as the tumor grows later.So&#xD;
      tumor immunotherapy is to maximize the patient's own immune system reaction against tumors,&#xD;
      and it is not only necessary to activate the original immune system reaction in vivo, but&#xD;
      also to maintain the duration and intensity of the reaction, which is the key to&#xD;
      immunotherapy against tumors.The 2017 FDA approval of the immune checkpoint inhibitor PD-1&#xD;
      inhibitor pembrolizumab for patients with MSI-H / dMMR pan tumors laid the groundwork for&#xD;
      immunotherapy in cholangiocarcinoma.In the current clinical study of advanced&#xD;
      cholangiocarcinoma, the combination regimen of PD-1 inhibitor + FOLFOX4 / GEMOX demonstrated&#xD;
      a favorable survival benefit with an acceptable safety profile in advanced&#xD;
      cholangiocarcinoma.Tirelizumab (Baiji Shenzhou) is a humanized lgg4 anti programmed death&#xD;
      receptor 1 (PD-1) monoclonal antibody designed to minimize binding to FC γ r receptors in&#xD;
      macrophages.Preclinical data suggest that FC γ r receptor engagement in macrophages is&#xD;
      followed by activation of antibody dependent cell-mediated killing of T cells, reducing the&#xD;
      antitumor activity of PD-1 antibodies.Tirelizumab is currently under clinical investigation&#xD;
      as a single agent and combination therapy worldwide, developing a range of broad indications&#xD;
      for both solid tumours and haematological tumours.There are currently 15 potential registered&#xD;
      clinical studies of bazea in China and worldwide, including 11 phase 3 studies, four pivotal&#xD;
      phase 2 studies.A phase I / II study evaluating the efficacy of tirelizumab monotherapy in&#xD;
      Chinese patients with advanced solid tumors across cancer types, using a 200 mg IV q3w dose&#xD;
      and dosing schedule, has demonstrated tolerability at this dose in the Chinese population, a&#xD;
      favorable clinical safety profile, and no contraindications in combination with&#xD;
      chemotherapeutic agents such as capecitabine have been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to conduct a single center prospective interventional cohort study of capecitabine&#xD;
      plus PD1 MAb given to patients who have been evaluated for high-risk recurrence after surgery&#xD;
      for cholangiocarcinoma, to evaluate its efficacy and safety compared with capecitabine alone,&#xD;
      and to strive for an effective treatment option in preventing postoperative metastatic&#xD;
      recurrence of cholangiocarcinoma.&#xD;
