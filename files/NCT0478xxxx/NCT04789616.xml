  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The CAMAROS trial is a randomized controlled phase II trial analyzing the effect of coupling&#xD;
      a C-C chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) antagonist, Maraviroc (Celsentri), and exercise to improve&#xD;
      both upper and lower extremity recovery after a stroke.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After stroke, the combination of progressive skills practice in an adequate dose plus&#xD;
      exercise for fitness augments motor and cognitive outcomes. However, sensorimotor and&#xD;
      cognitive improvements often plateau after 12 weeks. There is an urgent need to find novel&#xD;
      methods to drive recovery and lessen limb paralysis. Drugs that might enhance learning or&#xD;
      neural repair, as well as other molecular and synaptic adaptations that occur during skills&#xD;
      training and fitness exercise, might extend that recovery curve, although to date only&#xD;
      fluoxetine has given any hint of this. Most trials have tested agents that modulate&#xD;
      neurotransmitters. Several very recent preclinical experiments and observational studies in&#xD;
      patients after stroke suggest that the commercially available medication, Maraviroc, may&#xD;
      augment skills learning during rehabilitation training especially during the first three&#xD;
      months after onset, by acting on unique molecular components for novel learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CAMAROS trial is a randomized, placebo-controlled, blinded phase II trial evaluating the&#xD;
      efficacy of coupling Maraviroc (Celsentri) with exercise rehabilitation across multiple&#xD;
      Canadian sites in 120 stroke participants. Patients will begin their participation within 6&#xD;
      weeks of stroke onset. Both groups will receive an exercise program in addition to standard&#xD;
      of care rehabilitation, but only one group (the intervention group) will receive the active&#xD;
      drug Maraviroc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be evaluated at baseline, after 4 weeks of taking the drug/placebo,&#xD;
      after 8 weeks of taking the drug/placebo, and at 6-months post-stroke. While enrolled in the&#xD;
      study, participants will be required to take part in an 8 week, daily exercise program.&#xD;
      Evaluators and participants will be blind to the treatment administered. The trial is&#xD;
      constructed with randomization to remove selection and allocation biases and to ensure&#xD;
      greater validity in observed differences in the outcome measures.&#xD;

    <measure>Action Research Arm Test (ARAT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (between 5 days and 6 weeks after stroke), after 4 weeks on drug/placebo, after 8 weeks on drug/placebo, and 6-months post-stroke</time_frame>
    <description>The ARAT assesses arm function to determine the quality of the arm movement, and the limitation of activity. The ARAT consists of 4 sub-tests; that examines and individual's grip, grasp, pinch and gross motor movement in order to determine upper extremity function. Objects of varying size, shape, and weight must be either grasped, handled or moved in a specific task in order to evaluate function. Low scores mean worse function with the minimum possible score being 0 and the highest possible score being 57 (normal function).</description>

    <description>Stroke-specific, self-report, health status measure. Assesses multiple domains on a 5-point Likert scale. Domains include: strength (4-20), hand function (5-25), activities of daily living/instrumental activities of daily living (10-50), mobility (9-45), communication (7-35), emotion (9-45), memory and thinking (7-35), and participation (8-40). An extra question asks that the patient rate on a scale from 0 - 100 how much they feel that he/she has recovered from his/her stroke. The 4 physical domains (strength, hand function, mobility and activities of daily living) can be summed together to create a single, physical dimension score (28-140) while all other domains should remain separate.
