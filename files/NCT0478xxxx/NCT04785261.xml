      This is a single center, randomized, single-blind, controlled pilot study of CJDHW plus JWXYS&#xD;
      as a complementary therapy to treat dry eye disease during a 12-week period. The&#xD;
      investigators intend to enroll 60 subjects aged between 20 and 75 years old (treatment&#xD;
      group(N=30); controlled group(N=30)). Treatment group will be treated with artificial tears&#xD;
      combined with TCM, while control group will use artificial tears only. The aim of this study&#xD;
      is to explore the efficacy of TCM for dry eye disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dry eye disease (DED) is a chronic inflammatory disease. In severe cases, it may cause&#xD;
      corneal ulcers, blurred vision, and even blindness. The prevalence of DED is about 30% in&#xD;
      Taiwan. With the popularity of technological products and prolonged average life expectancy,&#xD;
      the incidence of dry eye disease is increasing at a rate of 10% per year in Taiwan. However,&#xD;
      treatment of DED mainly focuses on symptom relief in modern medicine. It is a difficult&#xD;
      problem to improve the pathological state of patients with DED. Hence, there is an urgent&#xD;
      need for a more effective and safe method of treating this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chi-Ju-Di-Huang-Wan (CJDHW) is commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for eye&#xD;
      diseases. However, current research shows that use CJDHW alone to treat dry eye is less&#xD;
      effective for tear secretion, which may be related to the unimproved inflammation state.&#xD;
      Ligustilide and ferulic acid, which own significant anti-inflammatory effects, are the&#xD;
      effective ingredients of Jia-Wei-Xiao-Yao-San (JWXYS). Many studies have demonstrated that&#xD;
      JWXYS can reduce serum TNF-α and IFN-γ levels in patients with DED. Therefore, the&#xD;
      investigators choose to use CJDHW plus JWXYS for treatment in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single center, randomized, single-blind, controlled pilot study of CJDHW plus JWXYS&#xD;
      as a complementary therapy to treat dry eye disease during a 12-week period. The&#xD;
      investigators intend to enroll 60 subjects aged between 20 and 75 years old (treatment&#xD;
      group(N=30); controlled group(N=30)). Treatment group will be treated with artificial tears&#xD;
      combined with TCM, while control group will use artificial tears only. The evaluation will be&#xD;
      conducted on 1st, 4th, 8th,12th week. Primary endpoints include Schirmer's test and&#xD;
      non-invasive tear film breakup time(NiBUT); secondary endpoints include tear meniscus height,&#xD;
      meibomian gland loss rate, tear cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) levels and&#xD;
      Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to explore the efficacy and possible mechanism of TCM for DED.&#xD;
