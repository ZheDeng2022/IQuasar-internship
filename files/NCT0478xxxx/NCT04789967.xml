  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      65% of the general population reported experiencing moderate to severe bloating symptoms.&#xD;
      Bloating could be disturbing to patients and frustrating to the physicians as an effective&#xD;
      treatment is still lacking. Guided Imagery (GI) involves the structured visualisation of&#xD;
      mental images with somatic sensory; whereas Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) focuses on&#xD;
      tightening and relaxing the body's specific muscle groups. The development and validation of&#xD;
      GI or PMR interventions to treat patients with functional abdominal bloating are relatively&#xD;
      novel.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The baseline variables of the patient would be obtained at the outpatient Gastrointestinal&#xD;
      Medical clinic. A thorough general clinical interview that encompasses medical and&#xD;
      psychological history, discussion of the nature and severity of the current symptoms, and&#xD;
      review of past treatments and conclusions of any medical evaluation and tests. This is to&#xD;
      make sure that the patients have been comprehensively evaluated medically and to rule out&#xD;
      other causes of abdominal bloating before reaching a firm diagnosis of functional abdominal&#xD;
      bloating as suggested in ROME IV Criteria. Questionnaires will be given out and patients were&#xD;
      asked to fill it up on the spot. Electrical activity and abdominal circumference would be&#xD;
      measured at an enclosed space with appropriate privacy and accompanied by a chaperone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imagery Therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group will undergo imagery therapy while the control group will undergo the&#xD;
      progressive muscle relaxation therapy which acts as a the control for this study.&#xD;
      Participants from both groups will receive identical instructions and thorough explanations&#xD;
      with visual aids regarding their respective interventions. Both groups will undergo the&#xD;
      therapy for 12 sessions respectively in an alternate day basis. Both groups will be required&#xD;
      to listen to a pre-recorded mp3 recording, either a progressive muscle relaxation therapy or&#xD;
      an imagery therapy script. They will need to follow the instructions given in the recordings&#xD;
      in each session on their own at least once a day, particularly after a meal. They are&#xD;
      required to record the time they carried out their intervention in a logbook that was&#xD;
      provided. A demonstration and face-to-face guidance will be given to the patients on the&#xD;
      initial baseline assessment as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Progressive Muscle Relaxation Therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) therapy works by progressively relaxing and tensing the&#xD;
      muscle groups throughout the entire body. The PMR script used in this study was validated and&#xD;
      used by previous researchers. Each muscle group will be tensed for about 5 seconds. If&#xD;
      there's any pain or discomfort at any of the targeted areas, participants were told to omit&#xD;
      that particular step. Constant purposeful deep breathing was instructed throughout the&#xD;
      session especially in between changes of muscle. Participants were seated in a comfortable&#xD;
      position and in a cool and quiet environment. Throughout the intervention, participants may&#xD;
      visualize the muscles tensing followed by a wave of relaxation as they release the tension&#xD;
      slowly. A momentary pause about 5-10 seconds will be given to the participant, allowing them&#xD;
      to relax before moving on from one muscle group to another.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group&#xD;
&#xD;
      A typical psychological intervention may call upon a wait-list control to provide researcher&#xD;
      a clear cut comparison in terms of efficacy between the groups. However, from an ethical&#xD;
      point of view in medicine, a wait-list control group may attribute to negative emotional and&#xD;
      psychosocial effects. Furthermore, the existence of such group may hinder the blinding&#xD;
      process and induces bias in the study. Therefore, there is a need to determine and select a&#xD;
      suitable placebo control intervention.&#xD;

    <description>Measured using the Malay version of Bloating Severity Questionnaire (BSQ-M). It consists of two components: five-item Sev24 and seven-item SevGen. The responses were in a multiple-choice answer format on different degrees of effect towards individuals on the basis of intensity, frequency and severity (less severe to more severe; range 1 to 4,5,6,7 or 8 varied by items). Higher scores in BSQ indicate worse severity.</description>

    <description>Measured using the Malay-Language Health of Bloating (HB-Bloat) Scale. The questionnaire consists of 12 items and 3 domains: attitude (3 items), subjective norm (5 items), perceived control towards self-management (4 items). All responses were measured on a five-point Likert scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).</description>

    <measure>Anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using the Malay version of Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). It comprises of 14 items, seven of which is related to anxiety symptoms. Each item is coded from 0 to 3. The scores for anxiety and depression can therefore vary from 0 to 21, depending on the presence and severity of the symptoms. A score between 0 and 7 does not indicate the presence of the symptoms of anxiety; a score between 8 and 10 indicates the presence of a moderate symptom; a score of 11 and above indicates a significant number of symptoms of anxiety corresponding to confirmed cases.</description>
