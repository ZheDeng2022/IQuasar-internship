      RV dysfunction has been associated with increased mortality in the ICU and cardiac surgical&#xD;
      patients. Thus, early identification of RV dysfunction at less severe stages will allow for&#xD;
      earlier intervention and potentially better patient outcomes. However, so far, no studies&#xD;
      have reported prospectively the prevalence of abnormal RV pressure waveform during cardiac&#xD;
      surgery and in the ICU. Our primary hypothesis is that the prevalence of abnormal RV pressure&#xD;
      waveform occurs in more than 50% of cardiac surgical patients throughout their&#xD;
      hospitalization. Those patients with abnormal RV pressure waveform will be more prone to&#xD;
      post-operative complications related to RV dysfunction and failure in the OR and ICU.&#xD;

      The pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) consists of an intravenous device placed in the pulmonary&#xD;
      artery to measure cardiac output, pulmonary artery pressures (Richard C, 2011) as well as&#xD;
      cardiac filling pressures. Since its initial presentation by Swan in 1970 (H J Swan, 1970),&#xD;
      several modifications were made on the initial catheter now allowing continuous assessment of&#xD;
      cardiac output, continuous monitoring of stroke volume (SV), systemic vascular resistance&#xD;
      (SVR) and mixed venous saturation (SvO2) (Arora, 2014) (H J Swan, 1970) (Richard C, 2011). We&#xD;
      intend to enhance current Swan-Ganz catheters with clinical decision support tools to early&#xD;
      identify hemodynamically unstable states that can lead to further deterioration of the&#xD;
      patient's health state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Right ventricular (RV) dysfunction is mostly associated to a decrease in contractility, right&#xD;
      ventricular pressure overload or right ventricular volume overload (François Haddad, 2008).&#xD;
      RV dysfunction can occur in several clinical scenarios in the intensive care unit (ICU) and&#xD;
      operating room (OR): pulmonary embolism, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic&#xD;
      shock, RV infarction, and in pulmonary hypertensive patients undergoing cardiac surgery&#xD;
      (François Haddad, 2008). RV dysfunction has been associated with increased mortality in the&#xD;
      ICU and cardiac surgical patients (André Y. Denault, 2006) (Denault AY B. J.-S., 2016). Thus,&#xD;
      early identification of RV dysfunction at less severe stages will allow for earlier&#xD;
      intervention and potentially better patient outcomes. Unfortunately, identifying which&#xD;
      patients will develop RV dysfunction and then progress towards RV failure have proven&#xD;
      difficult. One of the reasons for delaying the diagnosis of RV dysfunction could be the lack&#xD;
      of uniform definition, especially in the perioperative period. Echocardiographic definitions&#xD;
      of RV dysfunction have been described in previous studies: RV fractional area change (RVFAC)&#xD;
      &lt; 35 %, tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) &lt; 16 mm, tissue Doppler S wave&#xD;
      velocity &lt;10 cm/s, RV ejection fraction (RVEF) &lt;45% and RV dilation have been related to RV&#xD;
      dysfunction (Rudski LG, 2010). However, these echocardiographic indices cannot be&#xD;
      continuously monitored and are insufficient in describing RV function. The diagnosis of&#xD;
      fulminant RV failure is more easily recognized as a combination of echocardiographic&#xD;
      measures, compromised hemodynamic measures and clinical presentation (Raymond M, 2019)&#xD;
      (François Haddad, 2008) (Haddad F, 2009). RV dysfunction is inevitably associated with&#xD;
      absolute or relative pulmonary hypertension because of the anatomic and physiological&#xD;
      connection between the RV and pulmonary vascular system (Naeije R, 2014) (François Haddad,&#xD;
      2008). The gold standard for measuring pulmonary pressure is still the pulmonary artery&#xD;
      catheter. However, RV output can initially be preserved despite of pulmonary hypertension&#xD;
      (Denault AY C. M., 2006). It is therefore mandatory that early, objective, continuous, easily&#xD;
      obtainable and subclinical indices of RV dysfunction are found and validated to initiate&#xD;
      early treatment of this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since 2002, Dr Denault's group at Montreal Heart Institute has been using continuous RV&#xD;
      pressure waveform monitoring initially for the diagnosis of RV outflow tract obstruction&#xD;
      (Denault A, 2014) and then for RV diastolic dysfunction evaluation (St-Pierre P, 2014)&#xD;
      (Myriam Amsallem, 2016). Preliminary data based on a retrospective study on 259 patients&#xD;
      found that 110 (42.5%) patients had abnormal RV gradients before cardiopulmonary bypass&#xD;
      (CPB).Abnormal RV diastolic pressure gradient was associated with higher EuroSCORE II (2.29&#xD;
      [1.10-4.78] vs. 1.62 [1.10-3.04], p=0.041), higher incidence of RV diastolic dysfunction&#xD;
      using echocardiography (45 % vs. 29 %, p=0.038), higher body mass index (BMI) (27.0&#xD;
      [24.9-30.5] vs. 28.9 [25.5-32.5], p=0.022), pulmonary hypertension (mean pulmonary artery&#xD;
      pressure (MPAP) &gt; 25 mmHg) (37 % vs. 48 %, p=0.005) and lower pulmonary artery pulsatility&#xD;
      index (PAPi) (1.59 [1.19-2.09] vs. 1.18 [0.92-1.54], p&lt;0.0001). Patients with abnormal RV&#xD;
      gradient had more frequent difficult separation from CPB (32 % vs. 19 %, p=0.033) and more&#xD;
      often received inhaled pulmonary vasodilator treatment before CPB (50 % vs. 74 %, p&lt;0.001).&#xD;
      However, this was retrospective and limited to the pre-CPB period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2017, in a review article on RV failure in the ICU (Hrymak C, 2017), RV pressure waveform&#xD;
      monitoring using the paceport of the pulmonary artery catheter was recommended as a simple&#xD;
      method of monitoring RV function (Rubenfeld GD, 1999). However, no studies have reported&#xD;
      prospectively the prevalence of abnormal RV pressure waveform during cardiac surgery and in&#xD;
      the ICU.&#xD;
