  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of regular forest therapy under guidance&#xD;
      of a licensed nature therapist on patients with metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular risks&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is assumed that nature and forest experience has sustainable benefits for the physical and&#xD;
      mental health of individuals with metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular risk profile.&#xD;
      Especially co-therapeutic effects in terms of resilience and salutogenesis might effectively&#xD;
      and sustainably promoted by nature and forest therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to measure the effects of nature and forest therapy in&#xD;
      subjects with manifest metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular risk factors. The intervention&#xD;
      is a stay in the nature of the Düppeler Forest (Berlin-Wannsee) under the guidance of trained&#xD;
      nature guides (90 minutes, 1x/week over 2 months), who teach exercises on the perception of&#xD;
      nature and the connection between nature and health, movement and mindfulness. Subjects are&#xD;
      also motivated to experience forest nature as regularly as possible (recommended ≥ 30 minutes&#xD;
      daily). Participants of the control group will be offered a later participation in the&#xD;
      therapy program after completion of the last study visit after 4 months (waiting list control&#xD;
      group).&#xD;

    <description>The 31-item long form and the 9-item short form assess time spent on different activities. The short form records four types of physical activity: vigorous activity such as aerobics; moderate-intensity activity such as leisure cycling; walking, and sitting.&#xD;
MET minutes represent the amount of energy expended carrying out physical activity. To get a continuous variable score from the IPAQ (MET minutes a week) we will consider walking to be 3.3 METS, moderate physical activity to be 4 METS and vigorous physical activity to be 8 METS; higher score meaning better outcome; range 0 to around 3000 MET minutes a week</description>
