    <textblock>
      In summary, all evidence points in the direction that amino acid supplementation is justified&#xD;
      for augmenting desired fat loss associated with physical exercise as an obesity therapy.&#xD;
      Nonetheless, the present clinical data concerning oral use of amino acid is insufficient for&#xD;
      justifying its usage in humans as questions could arise with regards to its safety.&#xD;
      Therefore, the present study was proposed to establish the safety profile of amino acid for&#xD;
      human use by evaluating its use at a dose of 1000 mg per day in healthy individuals. The&#xD;
      occurrence of adverse events will be monitored and reported as per the Common Terminology&#xD;
      Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 (CTCAE v5.0), whereas the cardiac safety will be&#xD;
      assessed by changes in electrocardiogram parameters, blood pressure, and heart rate.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the effect of amino acid consumption on lipid profile will also be assessed by&#xD;
      measuring peripheral levels of leptin, adiponectin, total cholesterol, and triglycerides in&#xD;
      healthy individuals.&#xD;

      Insufficient physical activity is a global health problem and as per recent literature,&#xD;
      approximately one-third of the world's adult population fails to achieve recommended levels&#xD;
      of physical activity. An underappreciated primary cause of most chronic conditions is the&#xD;
      lack of sufficient daily physical activity. Overwhelming evidence proves the notion that&#xD;
      reductions in daily physical activity is primary causes of chronic diseases/conditions and&#xD;
      also that exercise is rehabilitative therapy from the inactivity-caused dysfunctions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several underlying mechanisms responsible for exercise-induced benefits such as,&#xD;
      organ-to-organ crosstalk that contributes to metabolic homeostasis and affects the&#xD;
      inflammatory response related pathways and fibrotic changes. Some of the best recognized&#xD;
      beneficial effects of exercise on muscles are mediated by the transcriptional factor&#xD;
      peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α). Skeletal&#xD;
      muscles are highly vascularized tissue and have secretory abilities. Not only muscles release&#xD;
      amino acids for fulfilling increased energy demand and to fuel the liver for undergoing&#xD;
      gluconeogenesis, but also proteins to mediate inter-tissue crosstalk. Robust research have&#xD;
      identified numerous endogenous factors secreted by myocytes (muscle cells) known as myokines&#xD;
      or &quot;exercise factor&quot; upon regular exercise via PGC-1α-dependent mechanism. It has been&#xD;
      reported that the levels of these myokines are upregulated during aerobic physical exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amino acid, a novel non-protein amino acid secreted by skeletal muscles which aids the&#xD;
      cross-talk between skeletal muscles, liver, and adipose tissue at molecular levels. amino&#xD;
      acid is generated by catabolism of the branched-chain amino acid valine. Existing literature&#xD;
      states, amino acid induces body fat loss by increasing energy expenditure, stimulating free&#xD;
      fatty acid (FFA) oxidation in the liver and skeletal muscle cell, and by enhancing oxygen&#xD;
      consumption by adipose tissue and hepatocytes. It was observed that amino acid stimulated&#xD;
      differentiation of energy storing white adipose tissue preadipocytes to an energy burning&#xD;
      &quot;beige&quot; (brown to white) phenotype. Uptake of plasma nutrients such as glucose, triglycerides&#xD;
      (TG)-rich very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), and FFA by cold-activated brown adipose&#xD;
      tissue might be responsible for modulatory effect of amino acid on lipid and glucose&#xD;
      metabolism. It is believed that amino acid also exerts its metabolic effects by modulating&#xD;
      other circulating signaling molecules such as leptin. amino acid affects lipid metabolism and&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity via restoring leptin levels in individuals with leptin deficiency. As&#xD;
      about 5-10% of the obese population are low leptin secretor, amino acid might be an ideal&#xD;
      intervention for fat loss in such population. It has also been demonstrated that amino acid&#xD;
      supplementation activates several &quot;thermogenic programs&quot; similar to those activated by&#xD;
      physical exercise. Furthermore, amino acid has been also shown to protect the osteocytes from&#xD;
      ROS-induced apoptosis through the MRGPRD and by also maintaining mitochondria integrity. This&#xD;
      protective capacity decreases with age as to the down regulation of Mrgprd expression in&#xD;
      osteocytes.&#xD;
