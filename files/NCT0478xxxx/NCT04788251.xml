    <textblock>
      Exercise-based fall prevention programmes with strength and balance components have been&#xD;
      shown to reduce the rate of falls, risk of falling, fractures and injuries. However, there is&#xD;
      little evidence on the implementation of these programmes in real-world settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to assess the effectiveness of exercise-based fall prevention interventions&#xD;
      on fall risk (physical performance and fear of falling) among community-dwelling older adults&#xD;
      who are at risk of falling in Singapore. A secondary aim is to assess the effectiveness of&#xD;
      the programme on other health outcomes. The study will also evaluate the programme&#xD;
      implementation from 3 perspectives of older adults, implementers and community partners.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two exercise-based fall prevention programmes (Otago Exercise Programme, OEP and the Stepping&#xD;
      On Programme, SOP) have been shown to be effective to prevent and reduce falls in primarily&#xD;
      non-Asian settings. The Otago Exercise Programme is a single component intervention that has&#xD;
      been shown to reduce fall rate among older adults by 35%. The OEP is a group-based exercise&#xD;
      programme based on strength and balance components. The Stepping-On Programme is a&#xD;
      multi-component intervention that has been shown to reduce fall rate by 30%. The SOP consists&#xD;
      of group-based series of weekly sessions to teach fall prevention strategies to&#xD;
      community-dwelling older adults. Sessions comprise of strength-balance exercises and classes&#xD;
      based on adult learning principles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there is little evidence of the effectiveness, feasibility and acceptability of&#xD;
      locally-adapted community fall prevention interventions. Furthermore, studies on the&#xD;
      effectiveness of fall prevention interventions among Asian populations are less robust due to&#xD;
      the lack of well-designed studies with adequately powered sample sizes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, exercise-based fall prevention programmes will be implemented based on&#xD;
      geographic region where participants living in the North region will receive the modified SOP&#xD;
      and participants in the Central region will receive the modified OEP.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial in which there will be a sequential crossover of clusters from the waitlist control to the intervention period where the sequence of crossover is randomized. The clusters are defined as groups with at least 5 participants. Each of the North and Central regions will have 6 clusters.&#xD;
The intervention will be sequentially rolled out to 12 clusters that are randomized to 6 time periods (sequences). Each sequence has 6 steps where one step has a duration of 8 weeks. The intervention will be rolled out sequentially to 2 clusters (1 North, 1 Central) at every step until all 12 clusters have received the intervention by the end of the study. Each cluster will have 1-3 community sites and minimum 5 participants. Outcome assessors will be blinded to sequence allocation.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The modified OEP is a group exercise programme that consists of progressive strength and balance exercises led by trained exercise leaders (fitness instructors or health coaches). The supervised sessions will be conducted twice a week (1 hour each) for 7 weeks. Participants will be given an exercise booklet and encouraged to exercise at home.&#xD;
The modified SOP is a group fall prevention programme that consists of exercise sessions and discussions on various falls prevention aspects facilitated by a trained programme leader and supported by programme facilitators and peer facilitators. The supervised sessions will be conducted once a week (2 hours each) for 7 weeks. Participants will be given homework and encouraged to exercise at home. In addition, there will be an optional home visit (Week 11), a 1-hour booster session (Week 19) and a telephone call (Week 31).</description>
