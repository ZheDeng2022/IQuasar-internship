  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ERASE - TB study will be conducted in order to fill a critical unmet need for&#xD;
      tuberculosis control. Persons who are in contact with an infectious TB case may become&#xD;
      infected themselves. Among those who are infected, most will stay healthy but some will&#xD;
      develop TB themselves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These people would benefit from preventive treatment, which would also stop TB from being&#xD;
      spread to other persons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The problem currently is that it is impossible to determine with certainty who would require&#xD;
      preventive treatment, and who will remain healthy. Out of 100 persons exposed to an&#xD;
      infectious TB patient, only 2 will go on to have TB according to a study in Vietnam, but&#xD;
      there are no good tests available to identify those with a risk for TB disease. Treating 100&#xD;
      persons to prevent 2 cases of TB is not effective, so preventive treatment is not used in&#xD;
      adults and adolescents in Tanzania, Mozambique and Zimbabwe, where this study will be&#xD;
      conducted, but also in many other settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ERASE - TB project will evaluate a number of newly developed diagnostic tests, to see&#xD;
      which of those will be able to predict TB in persons at risk, and therefore steer preventive&#xD;
      treatment well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this, the investigators will invite 2,100 household contacts (HHC) of infectious TB&#xD;
      patients, who are at least 10 years old, into the study. Everyone will be examined initially,&#xD;
      and again in regular intervals, for 1.5 to 2 years; and whenever the participants will&#xD;
      present with symptoms that could indicate that they develop TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At every visit, the investigators will perform an X-ray and take some blood and urine samples&#xD;
      to perform new candidate tests. At the first/baseline visit, all household contacts without&#xD;
      TB will undergo a spirometry to evaluate their pulmonary function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If someone is unwell, the investigators will also examine sputum for the presence of TB&#xD;
      bacilli. In the end, the investigators will then be able to say who of the persons in the&#xD;
      study developed TB, and who remained healthy. From all samples taken at different timepoints,&#xD;
      the investigators will then determine which test found TB early, and clearly distinguished&#xD;
      between persons developing TB, and persons who would remain healthy .&#xD;
