      1. Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      This document is a protocol for a randomized, controlled clinical trial. This study will be&#xD;
      carried out in accordance with the procedures described in this protocol, applicable United&#xD;
      States government regulations and Western International Review Board policies and procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1 Background and Clinical Need for the Current Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, vasectomy reversals are a common surgical treatment performed to restore fertility&#xD;
      in men who have previously undergone vasectomies. Post-operatively, sperm are seen in the&#xD;
      ejaculate in the majority of men undergoing a reversal, however, sperm counts commonly&#xD;
      fluctuate over time. In a percentage of men, counts will ultimately decline to 0 over time.&#xD;
      Although the exact cause of this decline is unknown, it is felt to be secondary to tissue&#xD;
      remodeling and/or inflammation leading to stenosis of the anastomotic repair. To address this&#xD;
      issue, clinicians have used prednisone for several decades. Despite the long-standing use,&#xD;
      very few publications have assessed the overall efficacy of this therapy on improving&#xD;
      outcomes. The objective of the current study is to perform a much more robust assessment as&#xD;
      to the true risks and benefits of this therapy in improving post-operative outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 Investigational Treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
      Men who are post vasectomy reversal will be treated with either no therapy (control) or one&#xD;
      of three separate protocols with prednisone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3 Preliminary Data&#xD;
&#xD;
      A very limited amount of data exists regarding the efficacy of corticosteroids in improving&#xD;
      outcomes post vasectomy reversal. The earliest known study involved the use of cortisone in 8&#xD;
      dogs who underwent vasovasostomy procedures. Results showed that 63% of vasa were patent in&#xD;
      the steroid group compared to 43% in control animals (not statistically significant). A&#xD;
      second study administered prednisone to 20 men post vasectomy reversal and compared against&#xD;
      20 men who had previously undergone reversal but were not treated with prednisone. Results&#xD;
      showed improved sperm counts (statistically significant) without statistically significant&#xD;
      differences in pregnancy rates. And finally, a third study performed a retrospective analysis&#xD;
      in 89 men who underwent reversals over a period of 11 years. Results demonstrated increases&#xD;
      in total motile sperm counts, with greater improvements noted among men who exhibited the&#xD;
      presence of sperm at the time of prednisone administration compared to those with 0 sperm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These data are limited by several factors. The first study listed also performed a pathologic&#xD;
      analysis and failed to demonstrate any differences in the extent of fibrosis. The second&#xD;
      study was performed in a sequential manner, where outcomes may have just been reflective of&#xD;
      learning curve improvements, and improvements were no longer present after the steroid was&#xD;
      discontinued. The third study was retrospective in nature, and therefore is limited by&#xD;
      significant biases (i.e. only men with low counts received the treatment, which leads to an&#xD;
      effect bias). All series were very small and lacked statistical power.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite these limited data, the use of prednisone post vasectomy reversal is a common,&#xD;
      widespread practice among reversal surgeons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.4 Study Rationale and Risk Analysis (Risks to Benefits Ratio)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is currently designed to address an important clinical question. Specifically, does&#xD;
      the addition of prednisone post-operatively lead to improved semen and pregnancy outcomes.&#xD;
      Additionally, does the addition of prednisone lead to temporary or permanent improvements.&#xD;
      Regarding potential risks, the use of prednisone will be limited to shorter durations of&#xD;
      therapy. Potential risks in a young, healthy population are low. Specifically, an analysis of&#xD;
      men 20-64 found that the risks of prednisone include 3 GI bleeds per 100 person years, &lt;1&#xD;
      with a severe infection, and &lt;1 with heart failure. Our study will not include as high of a&#xD;
      dosage or duration of therapy shown in this prior risk study, and as such, the true risks are&#xD;
      anticipated to be small (if any).&#xD;
