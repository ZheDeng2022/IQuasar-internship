    <textblock>
      This randomized, phase 2 study will investigate the use of the Signatera ctDNA assay versus&#xD;
      the standard scan-based approach to guide treatment in patients with metastatic colorectal&#xD;
      cancer. The aim of this study will be to measure and compare the overall survival,&#xD;
      progression-free survival, and best overall response while on study of patients whose&#xD;
      treatment has been guided by these two approaches.&#xD;

    <description>Subjects on this arm will be tested with the Signatera ctDNA assay while receiving treatment on a pre-specified sequence of FDA-approved drugs and drug combinations. Subjects will move through this sequence based on the results of the ctDNA assay. Subjects will move to a new drug or drug combination in the sequence when the ctDNA assay indicates a significant increase in ctDNA level. Subjects will also have imaging scans every 12 weeks while on each drug or drug combination and subjects will move to a new drug or drug combination if these scans indicate disease progression.</description>
