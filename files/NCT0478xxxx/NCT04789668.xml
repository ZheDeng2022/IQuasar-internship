  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the best dose and effect of pimasertib in combination with&#xD;
      bintrafusp alfa in treating patients with cancer that has spread to the brain (brain&#xD;
      metastases). Immunotherapy with bintrafusp alfa, a bifunctional fusion protein composed of&#xD;
      the monoclonal antibody anti-PD-L1 and TGF-beta, may help the body's immune system attack the&#xD;
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Pimasertib may&#xD;
      stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;
      Giving pimasertib and bintrafusp alfa may help to prevent or delay the cancer from&#xD;
      progressing (getting worse) and/or coming back.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Establish safety profile and recommended phase II dose for combining pimasertib with&#xD;
      bintrafusp alfa (M7824) in patients with brain metastases. (Phase I) II. Time to intracranial&#xD;
      progression (defined as progression of existing lesions and development of new lesions by&#xD;
      modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] 1.1). (Phase II) III. Overall&#xD;
      survival. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Intracranial progression 6, 12 and 18 months. II. Intracranial objective response rate as&#xD;
      measured by Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Brain Metastases (RANO-BM), immunotherapy&#xD;
      (i)RANO, and RECIST 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Time to second intracranial progression after salvage stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Overall survival rate at 6, 12 and 18 months. V. Frequency of grade 3+ intracranial&#xD;
      toxicities at 4 weeks, and 3, 6, 9, 12 and 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Frequency of extracranial progression and response rate at 8 weeks, and 3, 6, 9, 12 and&#xD;
      18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. Frequency of neurocognitive decline at 6, 12 and 18 months (optional). VIII. Changes in&#xD;
      neurocognitive function and health-related quality of life. IX. Dose, duration and frequency&#xD;
      of steroid use for symptomatic management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Identify molecular and/or immunological markers from biospecimens (tissue, blood, and&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid [CSF]) that are associated with treatment response and toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Identify imaging biomarkers of response and toxicity (acute radiation&#xD;
      effect/radionecrosis and neurocognitive changes) from multiparametric magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI) and/or delayed positron emission tomography (PET) that predict treatment&#xD;
      response and toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Identify correlative or surrogative relationship between systemic (blood) and imaging&#xD;
      markers and treatment outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of followed by a phase II dose-expansion&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive bintrafusp alfa intravenously (IV) over 1 hour every 2 weeks and pimasertib&#xD;
      orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 1 year&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 and 90 days, every 6&#xD;
      weeks during year 1, and then every 12 weeks for up to 2 years.&#xD;

             these mutations, will be excluded from this study. Patients who progressed or could&#xD;
             not tolerate these standard of care molecular targeted agents are eligible for this&#xD;
             study. Lung adenocarcinoma patients may be consented prior to the EGFR and ALK status&#xD;
             being known, but EGFR and ALK status must be determined prior to initiating therapy&#xD;
