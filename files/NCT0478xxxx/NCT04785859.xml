      INTRODUCTION: Current Neonatology has failed to reduce the incidence of moderate-severe&#xD;
      bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Although multiple models for predicting the risk of&#xD;
      dysplasia in preterm infants have been studied, none have been implemented in clinical&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE: To calculate a mathematical model to predict moderate-severe bronchopulmonary&#xD;
      dysplasia in newborns before 30 weeks of gestation based on pre and postnatal clinical&#xD;
      variables, lung ultrasound images and detection of biomarkers in nasopharyngeal aspirate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY: Multicenter case-control study, in which 10 Spanish neonatal intensive care&#xD;
      units (NICU) will participate. All participants will undergo a lung ultrasound in the first&#xD;
      24 hours, on the third day of life, at one week and two weeks of life, a nasopharyngeal&#xD;
      aspirate at one week of life, and cardiac ultrasound at one week and two weeks of life. It is&#xD;
      expected to include 240 patients in 29 months of study among all participating units: 200 for&#xD;
      the calculation of the model, and 40 more for its subsequent validation. These will be&#xD;
      divided between those with a diagnosis of moderate-severe BPD and those without, and the&#xD;
      values of each of the variables described in the methodology section will be compared between&#xD;
      the two groups. Those with a significant difference will be entered into a logistic&#xD;
      regression model to calculate those that best predict the final diagnosis. With the results&#xD;
      of the calculated model, a mobile application will be created with a risk of moderate-severe&#xD;
      BPD calculator in this population, for its worldwide distribution.&#xD;

      Type of study: case-control study. Study population: Neonates of less than 30 weeks´&#xD;
      gestation, born at any of the study centers, or transferred from other centers in the first&#xD;
      24 hours of life, during the study period. The participating hospitals will be: Puerta del&#xD;
      Mar University Hospital in Cádiz, Basurto University Hospital in Bilbao, Álvaro Cunqueiro&#xD;
      University Hospital in Vigo, Doctor Josep Trueta University Hospital in Girona, Clínic&#xD;
      University Hospital in Barcelona, León University Hospital, Gregorio Marañón University&#xD;
      Hospital in Madrid, German Trias i Pujol Hospital in Barcelona, Miguel Servet Hospital in&#xD;
      Zaragoza and Val d'Hebron Hospital in Barcelona.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study protocol: The following lung ultrasounds will be performed on the patients included in&#xD;
      the study: first 24 hours of life, 3rd day of life (DOL) and 7th DOL. At one week of life&#xD;
      detection of proteins in nasopharyngeal aspirates will be performed. During the first week of&#xD;
      life, an echocardiography will be performed in all patients to evaluate the possibility of a&#xD;
      patent ductus arteriosus and its hemodynamic significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first 20 patients who remain intubated at one week of life, tracheal aspirates will be&#xD;
      obtained too, to compare protein determination&#xD;
