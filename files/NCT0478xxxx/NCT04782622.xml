      The combination of Apatinib and Camrelizumab for progressed NSCLC patients with muti-line&#xD;
      therapy : a phaseⅠB clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brief Summary: Immunotherapy has made a major progress in Lung cancer.However, challenges&#xD;
      such as primary and acquired resistance, small fraction of benefit population and lack of&#xD;
      predictive and prognostic biomarkers even exist. The overall objective response rate is lower&#xD;
      than 20% in second line-treatment and the progression-free survival (PFS) is also similar to&#xD;
      or poorer than that of conventional second-line chemotherapy. Apatinib is a novel, orally&#xD;
      administered, multitarget receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits VEGFR, PDGFR,&#xD;
      FGFR, c-Kit, and other kinases. It functions by inhibiting tumor angiogenesis and&#xD;
      proliferative signaling pathways. We would observe and analyze the effectiveness and safety&#xD;
      of apatinib combined with Camrelizumab for advanced NSCLC after muti-line therapy to explore&#xD;
      the synergistic effect of anti-angiogenic agents and immunotherapy.&#xD;
