  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized quality improvement project. At least 200 statin-naïve&#xD;
      patients without a history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with incidental coronary&#xD;
      artery calcium (CAC) on a prior non-gated chest CT will be enrolled across the Stanford&#xD;
      Healthcare System and the Palo Alto Veteran's Affairs Healthcare System. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomized in a 1:1 fashion to notification or usual care arms. The primary aim of this&#xD;
      project is to estimate the increase in 6-month statin prescription among statin-naïve&#xD;
      patients without a history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with incidental CAC on a&#xD;
      non-gated chest CT who are randomized to receive notification of their findings vs. usual&#xD;
      care.&#xD;

    <description>Patients randomized to notification will receive a message sent by either the electronic health record (EHR) patient portal or postal mail that will inform them of the CAC identified on their previous chest CT. It will provide an overview of CAC, an image of their chest CT, and a recommendation that they discuss this finding with their clinician. These clinicians will be notified of these findings via an earlier EHR message. Any treatment decisions will be made by the patient and their clinician.&#xD;
Patients randomized to notification who are not prescribed a statin medication and do not have a documented discussion regarding statin therapy within three months will be sent a second message at that time. Their primary care providers will receive a second EHR message concurrently.</description>

    <description>Both arms have previously had their CT scans reported according to standard clinical practice. This may include notification of the CAC in the imaging report. The usual care arm will not receive any additional notification beyond this standard of care during the project.</description>
