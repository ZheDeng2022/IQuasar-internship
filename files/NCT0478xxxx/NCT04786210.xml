  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a split-scar study with a target sample size of 20. There are two interventions:&#xD;
      fractional erbium:YAG-assisted drug delivery of 5-fluorouracil and fractional&#xD;
      erbium:YAG-assisted drug delivery of triamcinolone acetonide. Patients will undergo&#xD;
      treatments in a series of 4 treatments at approximately 4 week Â± 1 week intervals.&#xD;
      Investigators will monitor for safety and continued benefit after the end of the&#xD;
      interventional treatment.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in POSAS score in Site A and Site B at first visit (pre-treatment) versus last visit (post-treatment)</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The observer scale of the POSAS consists of six items (vascularity, pigmentation, thickness, relief, pliability and surface area). All items are scored on a scale ranging from 1 ('like normal skin') to 10 ('worst scar imaginable'). The sum of the six items results in a total score of the POSAS observer scale.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Hamilton score of Site A and Site B</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Obtained by comparing clinical photographs of the scarred skin and healthy skin next to each other in Site A and Site B. The Hamilton scale consists of 4 items with a score range of 0 to 14 where 14 represents more severe scarring.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in scar measurements of sites A and B of the keloid treated with laser-assisted 5-FU versus laser-assisted TAC</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The measurements will be calculated as the total volume (length x width x height) in cm3 of the scar, or length x width in cm2 if the scars are flush with the surrounding skin scar surface</description>
