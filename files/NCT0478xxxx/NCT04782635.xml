      The objective of the study will be to assess the effect of artificial intelligence on&#xD;
      nutritional status of children post cardiac surgery in comparison to usual care group.To&#xD;
      assess usefulness of diet related mobile application in comparison to usual care group.To&#xD;
      identify diet related problems among children post cardiac surgery in both groups (usual care&#xD;
      group and intervention group ).&#xD;

      Research question Is there any impact of artificial intelligence on nutritional status of&#xD;
      children post cardiac surgery?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no impact of artificial intelligence on nutritional status of children post cardiac&#xD;
      surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operational definition:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Cardiac surgery There are large number of different surgical procedures (more than 150)&#xD;
           in congenital heart disease, it became necessary the grouping into categories or&#xD;
           relatively homogeneous strata, so that the comparisons between the outcomes were&#xD;
           performed. The RACHS-1 method was developed by the Children's Hospital Boston team&#xD;
           through a panel of 11 nationally representative members of pediatric cardiologists and&#xD;
           cardiac surgeon. It allocated 207 surgical procedures in 6 different categories with&#xD;
           similar risk for hospital mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Artificial intelligence (AI) Artificial intelligence is a way to make machines think and&#xD;
           behave intelligently. These machines are controlled by software inside them, so AI has a&#xD;
           lot to do with intelligent software programs that can control these machines. It is a&#xD;
           science that can help machines understand the world and accordingly react to situations&#xD;
           in the same way the humans do.27&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Nutritional status The state of a person's health in terms of the nutrients in his or&#xD;
           her diet. Nutritional status assessment is the interpretation of anthropometric (using&#xD;
           Length-for-age and Weight-for-age clinical growth charts and Z score), clinical (muscle&#xD;
           dystrophy) and dietary data (food frequency table, usual dietary intake and mobile based&#xD;
           application) to determine whether a person or groups of people are well nourished or&#xD;
           malnourished.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Nutrition related mobile application Application basic function would be support and&#xD;
           improve nutrition status of children. Personalization of goals and challenges, daily&#xD;
           intake of calories, carbohydrates, proteins, fats, minerals and vitamins will be&#xD;
           tracked, food logging, food tracking, meal and supplement reminders, recipes, visual&#xD;
           cues (remaining calories) will be notified, episodes of vomiting, meals missed,&#xD;
           diarrhea, nausea will be recorded , meal planned according to the food preferences of&#xD;
           child, food composition table, nutrition blogs and articles&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized controlled trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      SETTING:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tertiary Care Cardiac hospital, Rawalpindi , Pakistan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLING TECNIQUE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Permuted block BLINDING Double blinded study&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size is estimated to be 96, 48 in each group i.e. intervention and control group&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA ANALYSIS PROCEDURE All data will be analyzed using SPSS 23 Descriptive statistics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percentages and frequencies for all categorical variables&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Categorical Data will be presented in form of bar and chart&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mean and standard deviation for continuous data. Inferential statistics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For comparison of characteristics of patients between usual care group and intervention&#xD;
           group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Independent t-test for continuous variables&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chi square for categorical variables&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-test and post-test difference in mean changes will be assessed by Split-plot ANOVA&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare outcomes between usual care group and intervention group Chi square group&#xD;
           will be used&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical consideration The study will start after presenting research proposal and obtaining&#xD;
      ethical approval from Ethical Review Committee of Pakistan Institute of Ophthalmology,&#xD;
      Al-Shifa School of Public Health. A formal letter will be used that will include the&#xD;
      information relevant to the study e.g., the purpose and duration of this study, the level of&#xD;
      privacy and confidentiality of information with anonymity of the respondents. While&#xD;
