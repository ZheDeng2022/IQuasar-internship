    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this research is to explore the adherence and drop-out from early cardiac&#xD;
      rehabilitation (CR), to inform interventions to support patient's adherence to CR and&#xD;
      facilitate maintenance. The secondary aim is to understand which aspects of CR are essential&#xD;
      for improving health-related quality of life in the short and long-term. This research will&#xD;
      comprise four stages adopting a mixed-methods, quasi-experimental, repeated measures design.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will explore the attitudes of patients and healthcare practitioners towards the&#xD;
      components of CR (diet, smoking, and medication) and their relationship with improving&#xD;
      patients' perceived health and wellbeing. We will apply user-centred approaches by working&#xD;
      with patients and other stakeholders to develop the best solutions that help patients to&#xD;
      adhere to relevant health behaviour changes. The proposed study will use a mix of surveys and&#xD;
      interviews. This will conclude with a two-day workshop with patients and health care&#xD;
      professionals to come up with recommendations for improving adherence to CR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1: A bespoke survey has been designed to examine the perceptions of patients and health&#xD;
      care professionals. The survey will include questions around, CR referral, uptake and&#xD;
      adherence rates. Factors that hinder and improve attendance to CR will be explored. Surveys&#xD;
      will be distributed amongst CR patients across six centres in the United Kingdom: Sheffield,&#xD;
      London, North of England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. The aim is to collect survey&#xD;
      responses from 498 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2: Qualitative interviews will be carried out with both patients and professionals.&#xD;
      Topics will include factors that improve or hinder attendance and completion of CR. In&#xD;
      addition, factors in CR which assist with improving quality of life will be explored. This&#xD;
      will provide a more in-depth understanding of challenges to attendance identified in study 1.&#xD;
      Up to 10 patients from each site will be interviewed, plus up to 20 health care professionals&#xD;
      across all sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 3: Up to 30 participants recruited across regions will be invited to take part in a&#xD;
      two-day workshop. The two-day co-design workshop will involve patients, clinicians, CR&#xD;
      providers, and researchers. The aim is to develop recommendations and approaches to improving&#xD;
      attendance and completion of CR. This will include improvements to existing CR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Conduct, Participant identification, inclusion, and exclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each of the six sites currently delivers comprehensive early CR and provides access to&#xD;
      patients and providers with lived experience of the core components and behaviour changes&#xD;
      associated with CR adherence. A local principal investigator who is responsible for the&#xD;
      leadership of a research study has been identified at each site to oversee conduct of the&#xD;
      study protocol and facilitate participant recruitment. Participants will represent a range of&#xD;
      demographic backgrounds including ethnicity, socioeconomic group, cardiac diagnosis and&#xD;
      length of engagement with CR. Recruitment to interviews will stop when no new themes are&#xD;
      being identified from the interviews (data saturation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthcare professionals meeting our inclusion criteria will be approached directly, by the&#xD;
      principal investigator at each study site. People interested in the study will be given an&#xD;
      information sheet, and a minimum of 24 hours to consider study information before&#xD;
      recruitment. Patients will be identified and invited to take part in the qualitative study by&#xD;
      their healthcare professional upon referral to a CR programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients providing verbal consent will then be contacted by a member of the research team.&#xD;
      These patients will also be invited to take part in the qualitative interviews investigating&#xD;
      long-term adherence to CR (after six months). In the event that too few of the patients are&#xD;
      available for the interview after six months, further patients will be retrospectively&#xD;
      identified through the patient records kept by the CR team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant consent and withdrawal&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written informed consent will be sought from participants at all stages of the study&#xD;
      including the initial survey, subsequent interviews and/or co-design event. It will be clear&#xD;
      at all times throughout the research that participation is voluntary and withdrawal at any&#xD;
      stage without challenge will be supported. Information relating to participant consent will&#xD;
      make explicit than any data collected prior to the participants' withdrawal may be retained&#xD;
      for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survey&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surveys will be completed online or sent via post to all identified eligible patients. If a&#xD;
      patient decides to complete the survey online, an accessible email link will be sent via a&#xD;
      web link using a licensed copy of Qualtrics survey software. Participants will be asked to&#xD;
      read the study information and sign/digitally tick consent before proceeding to the survey&#xD;
      questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interviews and co-design event&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants who are interested in our study will be provided with written&#xD;
      information sheets and offered the opportunity to ask questions by phone, email or where&#xD;
      possible, face-to-face with the local principal investigator and/or a member of the core&#xD;
      research team at Sheffield Hallam University. Participants will be given a minimum of 24&#xD;
      hours to consider the study information, after which time they will be contacted to arrange&#xD;
      attendance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks to participants are estimated to be low; although it is possible there may be some&#xD;
      emotional effect of discussing issues and experiences related to cardiovascular disease,&#xD;
      treatment, and its potential impact on quality of life. Participants will be made aware of&#xD;
      the nature of the topics to be discussed during the informed consent process so that they&#xD;
      know what to expect. Participants will be made aware that they can withdraw from the study at&#xD;
      any time, or avoid any topics that cause discomfort. The co-design workshop will be&#xD;
      facilitated in a way that fosters sharing, non-judgment, and equality amongst group members.&#xD;
      It is important to manage expectations that group discussions during workshops are for&#xD;
      research purposes, and not directly intended as patient support groups. Links and contact&#xD;
      details will be provided for patients who express a need for further support, both verbally&#xD;
      and via participant information sheets.&#xD;
