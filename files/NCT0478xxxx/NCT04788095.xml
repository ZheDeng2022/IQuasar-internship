    <textblock>
      This trial tests the feasibility of an application (app)-based mindfulness intervention and&#xD;
      its effect on improving quality of life in patients with renal cell cancer that has spread to&#xD;
      other places in the body (metastatic). This trial aims to see whether an app-based&#xD;
      mindfulness intervention may help patients cope with their disease.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess feasibility of the Am mindfulness app in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC)&#xD;
      patients, with respect to accrual, adherence and engagement in program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess preliminary effects of app-based mindfulness intervention in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) (the Am Mindfulness-Based Cancer Survivorship [MBCS]&#xD;
      Journey), on psychosocial outcomes (e.g., anxiety, distress, fear of cancer recurrence), as&#xD;
      well as overall quality of life (QOL) and fatigue, among patients with mRCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients participate in a mindfulness-based program by using the Am app for 20-30 minutes&#xD;
      every day, a minimum of 4 days each week over 4 weeks.&#xD;

    <measure>Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI): Fatigue severity</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>This 9-item, 11-point rating scale was developed to assess subjective fatigue. The first three questions measure fatigue severity from 0, indicating &quot;no fatigue,&quot; to 10, indicating &quot;as bad as you can imagine,&quot; at current, usual, and worst levels. The following six questions assess fatigue interference with daily activities including general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work (both inside and outside the home), relations with other people, and enjoyment of life. Response options range from 0, indicating &quot;does not interfere,&quot; to 10, indicating, &quot;completely interferes.&quot; Higher scores on the BFI correspond to greater self-reported levels of fatigue. The time period for all questions is over the past 24 hours. Data reported as continuous measure: means, standard deviation/ median range to be provided.</description>
