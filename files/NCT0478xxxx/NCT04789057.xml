  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is a randomized, multicenter, prospective, double-blind, placebo controlled,&#xD;
      interventional clinical trial that will be conducted in Poland, in about 12 Hospital&#xD;
      Pulmonary Departments to evaluate the effectiveness of atorvastatin on the reduction of&#xD;
      inflammation process in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, and possible&#xD;
      biomarkers for personalized treatment of COPD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It will be a randomized, double-blind, two arm clinical study to assess effect of&#xD;
      atorvastatin 40 mg treatment in patients with stable COPD. The whole study duration will&#xD;
      include three phases: pre-study screening and enrollment procedures (4 weeks), clinical&#xD;
      assessment at dosing (52 weeks), and post study follow up (4 weeks). During the participation&#xD;
      in the study subjects will attend Visit 1 (V1, -4 weeks), visit 2 (V2, day 0), visit 3 (V3,&#xD;
      week6), visit 4 (V4, week 12), visit 5 (V5, week 26), visit 6 (V6, week 38), visit 7 (V7,&#xD;
      week 52), and follow-up end of study visit (EOS, 56 weeks). The study will begin with a&#xD;
      4-weeks screening phase where patients who fulfill preliminary inclusion/exclusion criteria&#xD;
      (prior to entry into study), will be given informed consent and screened. The baseline&#xD;
      laboratory tests, clinical and medical evaluation including concomitant medication and drug&#xD;
      of abuse will be completed to determine patient continuing eligibility to participate in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon confirmation of eligibility, the patients will be randomized into two treatment groups&#xD;
      receiving one of two medications tested in the study. Each patient enrolled into the clinical&#xD;
      study will have to report to the clinic 7 times in order to complete procedures. Blood will&#xD;
      be drawn before and during the statin or placebo treatment from patients according to study&#xD;
      protocol. This part of the project aims to develop statin response biomarkers for&#xD;
      personalized treatment of COPD, based on RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) information derived from,&#xD;
      leukocytes and blood plasma of COPD patients with characterized clinical Atorvastatin&#xD;
      response phenotypes.&#xD;
