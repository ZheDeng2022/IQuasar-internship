  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Congenital heart diseases (CHDs) are considered as the most common congenital birth defects,&#xD;
      comprising 1% of all live births . Echocardiography remains a first-line non-invasive imaging&#xD;
      tool for establishing the diagnosis and follow-up in most patients .This method is operator&#xD;
      dependent and limited by an acoustic window .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditional angiography is typically utilized as the gold standard modality for diagnosing&#xD;
      CHD, but it is an invasive method and need general anseathsia with dose of radiation exposure&#xD;
      .After recent developments in CT and MR technologies, cardiac catheterization is no longer&#xD;
      necessary for diagnosis .&#xD;

      The interpretation of cardiovascular structures on cardiac CT scan studies is similar to that&#xD;
      for echocardiography, however, it is not limited by the acoustic window or operator dependent&#xD;
      like ultrasonography. In addition to the anatomic information, a cardiac CT scan provides&#xD;
      hemodynamic information, including extracardiac and intra-cardiac shunts. It also enables the&#xD;
      systematic evaluation of other thoracic structures like cardiovascular structures, the&#xD;
      airways and the lungs by using maximum and minimum intensity projections to delineate the&#xD;
      vascular and airway structures, respectively. Extra-cardiac great vessels can be evaluated&#xD;
      along their length; thus augmenting the role of cardiac CT scans in children with congenital&#xD;
      heart diseases .Inspite of the poorer temporal resolution of cardiac CTA compared to&#xD;
      echocardiography, yet the combination of rapid acquisition time, increased anatomic coverage,&#xD;
      high spatial resolution, multiplanar reformation and 3D capability combined with a flexible&#xD;
      ECG synchronization have improved the image quality of cardiac CT scans and minimizing the&#xD;
      patient risks. Multidetector computed tomography has greatly advanced the noninvasive&#xD;
      diagnosis of these anomalies in pediatric patient, thus makes MDCT an ideal non- invasive&#xD;
      method for evaluating pediatric patients .&#xD;
